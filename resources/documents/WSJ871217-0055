Now comes yet another one: in biotechnology.    Biotech is still in its infancy, of course, but over the next few years a multibillion-dollar market seems sure to develop in genetically engineered products ranging from cancer treatments to new kinds of pigs and plants. And the U.S. and Japan, despite current joint ventures and alliances, are emerging as archrivals.    So far the U.S. holds a commanding lead, thanks to the creativity of its scientists. But Japan's government, its universities and scores of its big corporations are putting a huge effort into the field. &quot;Biotechnology is a magic word in Japan,&quot; says Wataru Yamaya, managing director of Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Ltd. His company, with a $233 million research and development budget, now devotes 40% of it to biotechnology.    For the U.S., most recently bloodied by the Japanese in semiconductors, there is reason for concern in this field, too. Biotech research consumes much time and money, with any payback far in the future. This isn't a problem for most of the Japanese players, because they tend to be huge corporations loaded with cash from their other operations. But many of the most promising American biotechnology firms are small and don't have any profitable businesses to sustain them.    Equally important, in the Japanese corporate world a manager is free to take a long-term approach, investing for years without showing any results. American companies constantly have to worry about their quarterly results and what stockholders, analysts and corporate raiders are thinking.    Finally, the Japanese threaten to neutralize America's advantage by gaining access to its scientific breakthroughs. Japanese companies have set up bioscience labs in the U.S., and Japanese money sponsors bioscience research at noted American universities like Rockefeller and Harvard. Some 300 Japanese scientists currently study in America under National Institutes of Health grants. Most perilously, large Japanese corporations are bankrolling some hard-pressed American start-up firms in exchange for a look at their best scientific secrets.    &quot;The American Randamp;D companies, they need the money,&quot; says Yaichi Ayukawa, a prominent Japanese venture capitalist with an American doctorate. &quot;They're really hungry. They make a deal with the Japanese. But then the Japanese tap you, strip you down. And three or four years later, the American side doesn't know what's going on.&quot;    Even while this is going on, the Japanese are working feverishly to build up their own ability to do biotech research. For one thing, they know the lopsided flow of scientific information is causing friction, which could, in the most extreme scenario, lead to moves in the U.S. toward technological protectionism. But another reason is that in biotechnology, patent law, which is still evolving, may strongly favor originators over copycats. So the link between basic science and commercial success may prove particularly close.    Meantime, Japan, preparing for the day when biotechnology markets are developed, is working on the so-called scale-up processes: fermentation and other techniques needed to make genetically engineered substances in volume. This is a phase is which Japan has excelled in such fields as autos, shipbuilding and steel.    The clearest indication of Japan's biotechnology ambitions may be the attention being given the field by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. When MITI gets involved, it's a safe bet the nation's senior strategists have targeted an industry for a big push. Though MITI does some biotech research, its main role is to spur and guide work by others. Like a fishing boat tossing chum in the water, it first charts a course and then plants money to attract more.    MITI has seeded four areas of biotechnology with money and set up groups of companies to work on them. The first three areas, established six years ago, are genesplicing, large-scale cultivation of cells and &quot;bioreactors,&quot; or microbes that can change one chemical into another. Then last year, the ministry started a 10-year research effort in the futuristic field known as bioelectronics, which envisions computers that would function more like the human brain and perhaps even use biological substances.    Other Japanese government agencies have dozens of other programs: to develop new types of proteins, to work up new rice hybrids, to let maverick scientists follow their instincts. And, using Japan's technological skill for a foray into fundamental research, they are trying to automate the attempt to map human genes.    Japan also is proposing an international joint effort in basic bioscience, which it calls the Human Frontier Science Program. Other nations haven't been very enthusiastic. &quot;People are skeptical that the notorious MITI has a basic-research program,&quot; says Katsuhiko Umehara, MITI's deputy director of the project. He concedes what others suspect: One of the program's aims is to improve Japanese science through increased contact with American and European researchers.    The Japanese seem to feel acutely vulnerable about their basic science. They have indulged much self-criticism, which only intensified when the Nobel Prize in medicine recently went to a Japanese who had moved to the U.S. 24 years ago. Touring Japan recently, the scientist, Susumu Tonegawa, appealed for change. &quot;Japan has developed its technology on foreign scientific achievements&quot; in this century, he said. &quot;Now that Japan is a large economic power, we cannot keep using the basic scientific achievements of others.&quot;    Many observers trace the weakness in scientific creativity to elements of Japanese society, such as the stress on group harmony over individual excellence. Academic scientists seem sealed within their departments, content to do a competent job there rather than excel world-wide, says Hajime Nishimura, the head of Tokyo University's department of chemical engineering. Some Japanese also say that their country has been fully occupied absorbing foreign science; now that it is technologically caught up, they add, it is ready to innovate.    The effort certainly is being made. Prof. Nishimura's department, which in the 1970s was concentrating on environmental and pollution studies, now focuses tightly on biotechnology research. He tells of a junior colleague who was studying environmental microbiology: &quot;Seven years ago I ordered him to convert his field to recombinant DNA,&quot; he says.    Prof. Nishimura says the U.S. is several years ahead in biotechnology, &quot;and the gap isn't closing.&quot; But some U.S. scientists see the Japanese getting stronger in some areas, among them enzymes, the proteins that act as catalysts in biological reactions. The British science journal Nature reports a sharp increase in the number of published articles by Japanese scientists, especially in bioscience.    In a country flooded with cash from trade surpluses, some of the progress flows from the sheer power of money. For instance, some big companies stuck in slowg-rowth businesses see biotechnology as a possible route to diversification. Chemical, food and liquor companies, for instance, are using biotechnology to build on their skills in brewing, fermentation or chemical processing. And they are willing to pour money into it.    An example is Suntory Ltd., a distiller that got into biotech eight years ago in hopes of developing drugs. It began by hiring an executive, Teruhisa Noguchi, who had pioneered the drug business elsewhere, and he quickly began spending Suntory's money. Hearing that an Australian marine laboratory was closing, he bought 400 species of marine life from it as a possible source of drug ideas.    Then he began trying to bring back Japanese scientists working in the U.S., managing to snag a genetic engineer from California Institute of Technology, a chemist from Columbia and a biologist from Harvard. With some of Suntory's own talent he put together a core group and built it a big laboratory.    The group focused on interferons, one of which, gamma interferon, now is being tested against leukemia, solid tumors and rheumatoid arthritis. By 1982 Suntory had synthesized the gamma interferon gene, and then -- in a notable reversal of the usual direction of technology transfer -- it licensed the know-how to an American company, Schering-Plough Corp.    Gamma interferons and three other drugs Suntory is working on now are in clinical, or human, trials. Though a commercial payoff is uncertain, Suntory continues to pour in money. Next spring it plans to open a $100 million development center.    Meanwhile, it has been aggressively acquiring U.S. technology. Suntory does joint research with Rockefeller University on brain function, seeking drugs for the ills, like senile dementia, of the world's growing elderly population. It licensed from Biogen the right to produce a natural cancer fighter called tumor necrosis factor. (The work is on hold because of TNF's unexpected side effects.) Finally, Suntory is looking for a broad partnership with a U.S. company.    One candidate is Genetics Institute, of Cambridge, Mass. Its officials know the risks in this: &quot;We terminated one possible joint venture,&quot; says Kuni Yamamoto, the manager of the U.S. company's Japanese unit. &quot;We didn't feel very comfortable giving away proprietary information and scientific know-how.&quot; Yet he says the company remains interested in forming close ties with one or more Japanese partners.    Why would U.S. companies license their hard-won biotech breakthroughs to a larger company that might turn around and beat them? The answer lies in the pressure they are under because of biotechnology's heavy costs, high risk of failure and, even with the successes, long delays before commercial payoff. The stock-market crash, pounding biotechnology stocks, only added to the pressure and the uncertainty of financing. Small biotech companies find that when it comes to venture capitalism, the Japanese are more patient.    They are more patient, also, when investing in large companies. A lot of Japanese shares are cross-held by friendly Japanese firms that buy and hold, not demanding big dividends or regular jumps in quarterly profit. For financing, Japanese companies -- those that aren't cash-rich, as many are -- tend to rely on bank debt, and the bankers, too, take a long view.    Large American companies have to worry much more about investor sentiment. And in the matter of biotechnology, it has blown hot and cold. In agriculture, for instance, securities analysts once rhapsodized about the prospect of new crops that would grow in the tundra or the desert. Now the view is more sober, among corporations as well as among analysts.    In these shifts lie a problem for the U.S. and an advantage for Japan. Rohm andamp; Haas Co., the Philadelphia chemical concern, started trying to develop a new strain of rice with Sumitomo Chemical Co. in the more optimistic days. It has since abandoned the idea. &quot;We pretty much got cold feet,&quot; says Ruben Salazar, the president of Rohm andamp; Haas's Japanese unit. &quot;We believe there will be a potential, but the time it will take is so long, and the investment is so big.&quot;    Sumitomo, in contrast, is continuing to pursue better rice through chemistry. And so are two other big Japanese companies, Mitsubishi Chemical and Mitsui Toatsu. In the end, Japanese willingness to stay in the biotechnology race, no matter how long the wait or how big the investment, may prove to be the greatest competitive advantage of all.    ---          Biotech's Global Competition and Cooperation   Some examples of Japanese, American and European venturesin three key areas of biotechnology                                         US      JAPANESE LEAD COMPANY         PARTNER        STATUS*     STATUS*         TISSUE PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR (HEART ATTACKS) Genentech            Mitsubishi    (US)              (Japan)                      Boehringer     Approved    Approved                      (Germany) Genetics Institute   Wellcome PLC    (US)              (Britain),                      Sumitomo                      (Japan)        Phase 2     Phase 2 Integrated Genetics  BASF    (US)              (Germany),                      Toyobo                      (Japan)        -------     Phase 2 Asahi Chemical    (Japan)           None           -------     Phase 2 Meiji Milk           Meiji Seika    (Japan)           (Japan)        -------     Phase 1 Biogen               Smithkline Beckman    (US)              (US)                      Yamanouchi                      (Japan         Preclinical Preclinical Chiron               Hoechst    (US)              (Germany)      Preclinical ------- Damon                Smithkline Beckman                      (US)                      Yamanouchi                      (Japan)        Preclinical Preclinical Bio-Response         None           Preclinical --------    (US) Green Cross          None           ----------  Randamp;D    (Japan) Monsanto             None           Randamp;D         --------    (US) Lilly                None           Randamp;D         -------- Sankyo               Cell Technology    (Japan)           (US)           ----------  Randamp;D       GAMMA INTERFERON (CANCER, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS) Biogen               Baxter Travenol                      (US)                      Shionogi                      (Japan)        Phase 3     -------- Amgen                Johnson andamp; Johnson    (US)              (US)           Phase 2,3   -------- Green Cross          None           ----------  Phase 2 Genentech            None           Phase 2     -------- Interferon Sciences  None    (US)              ------         Phase 1     -------- Takeda               None    (Japan)           ------         ----------  Preclinical Kyowa                Hayashibara    (Japan)           (Japan)        ----------  Preclinical Daiichi/Toray        None    (Japan)           ------         ----------  Preclinical                     HUMAN GROWTH HOMONE Genentech            None           Approved    Approved Lilly                None           Approved    -------- Biotech, General     Du Pont    (US)              (US)           Phase 3     Approved Cell Technology      Serono Labs                      (US)           Phase 3     -------- Sumitomo Chemical    None    (Japan)           ------         Phase 1     -------- Yamanouchi           Nordisk                      (Denmark)      Phase 2     Approved Kabivitrum           Sumitomo    (Sweden)          ------         ------      Approved Calif.
