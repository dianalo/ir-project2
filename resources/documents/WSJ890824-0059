Workers have been on strike since Aug. 6, when their old three-year labor agreement expired.    The company said it also will meet this afternoon with bargainers for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in New Jersey. The union, which represents 9,000 Bell Atlantic employees, is scheduled to give the company its response to a contract offer presented last Friday. Another IBEW unit in Pennsylvania has reached tentative agreement on a new contract.    Bell Atlantic and the CWA, which represents about 41,000 employees at the telephone operating company, already have reached agreement on major issues such as wages, pensions and benefits. The two sides had set a deadline of midnight Tuesday to reach agreement on local issues such as work rules, but extended the talks early Wednesday morning after failing to resolve issues.    Meanwhile, Chicago-based Ameritech and the CWA are scheduled to return to the bargaining table today. About 40,000 of the company's workers are represented by CWA. No talks are scheduled to try to resolve the strike against New York-based Nynex Corp., where the CWA represents about 40,000 workers and IBEW represents 20,000. </TEXT></DOC>
