Delegates to the Standing Committee of the National People'sCongress also condemned one of their number for supporting Zhao'seffort.   The legislators' speeches, made in a closed meeting but carriedby the official Xinhua News Agency, gave the first details of Zhao'sfailed power struggle against hardliners led by senior leader DengXiaoping. Party officials who ousted Zhao on June 24 said only thathe ``made the mistake of supporting the turmoil and splitting theparty.''   One congress delegate also lashed out at the U.S. Congress forvoting for trade and aid sanctions against China following thearmy's June 3-4 attack on the protesters in which hundreds andpossibly thousands of people died.   ``It is a violation of the international law as well as a slanderand attack on the Chinese people and Chinese government,'' Xinhuaquoted Fu Hao, a delegate from northwestern China's Shaanxiprovince, as saying.   It quoted another delegate, Song Rufen of Sichuan province, assaying that after Premier Li Peng declared martial law May 20 to endthe student protests, ``people from Zhao's think tank came out frombehind the scenes and advocated `opposing martial law' and `downwith the puppet government.'   ``They also demanded ... a special session of the NationalPeople's Congress,'' Song said. ``The very next day, Zhao Ziyangalso suggested that an emergency meeting of the (congress) StandingCommittee be held.''   Song and several other delegates accused fellow legislator HuJiwei of supporting Zhao. Hu enlisted the help of a researchinstitute run by China's first private high-technology company, theStone Corp., in collecting legislators' signatures on a petition foran emergency congress session.   Hu said he collected 38 signatures, but fellow legislatorsaccused Stone of signing some names of people who did not supportthe petition.   ``Some people with ulterior motive manipulated behind the scenesto achieve their own secret political goals,'' Beijing Radio quotedlegislator Zhang Chengxian as saying at Wednesday's session.``Comrade Hu must bear responsibility for this.''   A warrant reportedly has been issued for the head of Stone, WanRunnan, but sources in Hong Kong say he has fled China.   The congress Standing Committee, a smaller body that acts for thenearly 2,000-member congress between its annual sessions, began aspecial session last week, but has expressed support for thecrackdown on the protesters. Like Zhao, many students had hoped thecongress would meet before the hardliners consolidated theirposition and would challenge martial law.   Several legislators did call for some of the political reformsdemanded by the students, including strengthening of China's new andincomplete legal system.   Xinhua quoted Tibetan delegate Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, a longtimesupporter of the communist government, as saying that China had agood constitution and laws but did not implement them well,resulting in corruption.   Other delegates called for quicker action in drafting laws. Chinabegan establishing a body of civil law only in the late 1970s andmany areas remain uncovered.   Local and provincial governments announced new efforts to combatofficial corruption, another demand of the students. It remained tobe seen how thoroughly the reform moves would be carried out orwhether they were efforts to placate an increasingly dissatisfiedpublic.   The People's Daily newspaper said officials had cracked thebiggest corruption case in Beijing during 40 years of communistrule, arresting six people for allegedly defrauding a governmentresearch institute of $105,000.   Also on Wednesday, hotel officials said the government hasordered major joint-venture hotels in the capital to unhook theirsatellite dishes which receive foreign news broadcasts, includingCable News Network. China is engaged in an intensive propagandacampaign to discredit Western news accounts of the crackdown on theseven-week pro-democracy movement.   The Japanese Embassy said that soldiers stopped and boarded threebuses carrying a Japanese youth delegation and confiscated film theyshot of soldiers guarding central Beijing's Tiananmen Square.Tiananmen was the center of the student protest movement.   ``It was not a big deal,'' said embassy official Hideo Tarumi.   The youths had just arrived in Beijing from North Korea, wherethey took part in an international youth festival.</TEXT></DOC>
