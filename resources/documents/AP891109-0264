Economists were looking for commerical banks to cut by one-halfpercentage point their prime lending rate, which is used as a baseto calculate more than one-third of their business and consumerloans.   One bank, Southwest Bank of St. Louis, said Wednesday that itwas cutting its prime lending rate from 10.5 percent to 10 percent.While the move was not immediately followed by the country'slargest banks, analysts predicted that it would be, perhaps laterthis week.   Many economists predicted that the easier Fed monetary policywould accelerate a move to lower mortgage rates.   Wall Street was buoyed by the Fed's actions with stock prices upsharply on investor optimism that the central bank was moving tokeep the economy from slipping into a recession. The Dow Jonesaverage of 30 industrial stocks closed with a gain of 26.23 pointsat 2,623.36.   As usual, the Fed made no announcement of its decision to movetoward an easier monetary policy.   However, analysts said there was little doubt that such adecision had been made, given the fact that a bellwether interestrate, the federal funds rate, traded again Wednesday at 8.5percent, down from 8.75 percent when the week began.   The federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge eachother to make overnight loans. Because it is directly influenced bythe Fed's decisions on the amount of cash to make available to thebanking system, it considered the best gauge of Fed policyintentions.   ``It is clear that the Fed has eased,'' said Allen Sinai, chiefeconomist of the Boston Co. ``The central bank is acting to preventthe economy from heading into a serious downturn.''   Federal Reserve officials refused comment on a report inWednesday's Washington Post that the decision to ease was madeduring a telephone conference call Monday among members of theFederal Open Market Committee, composed of Fed board members inWashington and presidents of five of the 12 regional FederalReserve banks.   The FOMC, which gathers in Washington eight times a year to mapmonetary strategy, will meet Tuesday and some economists expressedsurprise that the Fed took action this week instead of waiting forthe regularly scheduled meeting.   The quarter-point drop in the federal funds rate this week isthe fifth small decline that has occurred since late May when thecentral bank began to reverse a year-long effort to drive interestrates higher as a way to fight inflationary pressures.   President Bush and others in the administration have beencomplaining that the central bank has been moving too slowly tolower interest rates. White House Budget Director Richard Darmanwarned in August that if the economy does slip into a recession, itwill be the fault of the Fed's tight-money policies.   Some economists, however, said Wednesday that the Fed was wrongto buckle to political pressure, warning that the action could makeinflationary pressures worse in 1990.   ``I am very disappointed in the Fed and very pessimisitc aboutthe chances of keeping inflation down,'' said Cynthia Latta, aneconomist with DRI-McGraw Hill. ``They may be thinking that theycan loosen, rescue the economy and then tighten again, butexperience has shown that doesn't usually work.''   Other economists were not as pessimistic, saying that if the Fedhad waited to ease until it got inflation down further, it wouldhave run an even greater risk of dumping the economy into adownturn.   ``Central banks in the past have made big errors in fightinginflation for too long and then watching as the economy tumblesinto a widespread, broad recession,'' Sinai said. ``That justintensified the downturn and forced the central bank to pump up theeconomy with easy money, creating a bust-boom situation.''   Various analysts said they believed that a hallmark of the Fedunder Chairman Alan Greenspan has been a gradual approach to eithertightening or loosening monetary policy and for that reason theysaid that the 0.25 percent drop in the federal funds rate would notbe followed quickly by further decreases.   But even the modest reduction will be enough to promptreductions in the prime rate and other business and consumerborrowing rates, economists predicted.   Mortgage rates have already dropped into single digits withfixed-rate mortgages averaging 9.82 percent last week, according toa survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.   Some economists forecast that rates could drop by anotherone-half percentage point by the end of the year in response to theFed's easier credit moves.</TEXT></DOC>
