The attempted takeover, coming six days before a national plebiscite on a new constitution that would ensure Mrs. Aquino six more years in office, also underscored how turbulent the Philippines remains a year after its nonviolent revolution. And even the crushing of an apparently well-coordinated rebellion seems unlikely to end the turmoil very soon.    By last night, rebel forces occupied only a television and radio station complex in suburban Manila, and government troops had cut off power to that. Troops also dispersed a crowd outside the station, obviously fearing another show of &quot;people power&quot; similar to the vast demonstrations that helped sweep Mrs. Aquino into office.    Maj. Gen. Eduardo Ermita, the armed forces' deputy chief of staff, said that seven officers had been arrested in the attempted coup, which also involved assaults on three military bases, and that 271 military men had been taken into custody.    The apparent collapse of the rebellion, following Mrs. Aquino's skillful defusing of a potentially violent leftist demonstration Monday, showed the president unusually forceful and resolute. In a televised speech yesterday afternoon, Mrs. Aquino branded the rebels &quot;misguided personnel&quot; and said she would abandon her earlier delicate handling of the military. She vowed to court-martial the rebellious troops.    There is a time for reconciliation and a time for justice and retribution,&quot; she said sternly. &quot;That time has come.&quot;    Mrs. Aquino's reluctance to discipline officers involved in several earlier coup attempts suggested she doubted her control over the military and feared an army split that might further undermine her position.    Just as seriously, her failure to act against earlier plotters gave Mrs. Aquino a reputation for being a weak, ineffectual leader -- a view that seemed only to encourage other plots and attempted coups.    Mrs. Aquino's firm handling of the latest coup attempt is likely to reverse that impression, as is her deft handling of a leftist demonstration Monday against the killing of a dozen protesters by government troops last week.    Both actions show Mrs. Aquino confident enough of her support within the military to act against wayward troops. Moreover, her tough stand with the rebels is expected to generate a strong &quot;yes&quot; vote for the constitution -- particularly among moderate voters. Mrs. Aquino's natural constituency had begun talking of rejecting the new code as a sign of protest at her vacillating leadership.    Mrs. Aquino has endorsed the constitution and it is thus being viewed as a vote of confidence in her. Moreover, passage of the constitution would legitimize Mrs. Aquino's claim to the presidency, which she assumed after a disputed election last February.    Rebels involved in several previous coup attempts justify their opposition to Mrs. Aquino by contending that she held office illegally and ruled dictatorially without a constitution. Indeed, Col. Oscar Canlas, the air force officer leading the seizure of television Channel 7 and radio station DZBB, insisted he acted only out of concern for &quot;democracy.&quot; He denied in a radio interview any ties to Mr. Marcos, although soldiers and demonstrators supporting him carried signs calling for the former president's return.    Convincing as Mrs. Aquino's resolve may have been yesterday, however, it's unlikely to end the challenge to her authority -- even with the passage of the constitution. Mrs. Aquino has called for congressional and gubernatorial elections in May and elections for mayors and other local officers in August.    This campaigning probably will keep the political situation tense; a new congress filled with ambitious politicians is certain to further challenge Mrs. Aquino's leadership.    Details of the latest coup attempt remain murky, but Gen. Fidel Ramos, armed forces chief of staff, said in a television address that it began with simultaneous assaults by about 500 military men on two television stations, an air force base, a navy base and Camp Aguinaldo, headquarters of the defense ministry.    A firefight that left one rebel dead and sixteen wounded erupted at the air base that adjoins the Manila airport, but otherwise the attempt largely fizzled. The exception was the takeover of the privately owned radio-television station.    Marcos sympathizers inside the station and Aquino supporters outside repeatedly hurled rocks at each other during the day, ran for cover when the battle became too heated, and then returned to shout political slogans and sing partisan songs until the rock throwing began again.    The military broke up the demonstration once with tear gas, and moved firetrucks and riot troops into position around the station while rebel officers met inside with Maj. Gen. Ermita, the deputy chief of staff. Mrs. Aquino's press secretary, however, said she wouldn't accept a negotiated settlement with the rebels. &quot;They surrender or that's it,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
