This subdivision into componentsegments of both main traces and the extra traces produced by travellingionospheric disturbances (TIDs) is seen regularly on limited-range ionogramsin mid-latitude regions. F/sub 1/-region TID wavetrains of 5 or 6 cyclesare reported with periods around 10 min. The identification of wavetrainswhen extra traces are absent is made possible by QHT segments which arefound as a function of time to move to lower frequencies in the mannersimilar to that found for the extra traces. Furthermore particular QHTpatterns are ephemeral. It is suggested that the segments result fromsmall-scale stratifications produced by saturation effects of atmosphericgravity waves. Daytime ionograms also record spreading on first-and second-hoptraces as a result of very weak signals probably produced by reflectionsfrom field-aligned columns which could be embedded in the stratifiedregions. This spreading appears on ionograms as qusi-horizontal (QH)patches.</TEXT></DOC>
