The ministers, meeting under the auspices of the 46-memberOrganization of Islamic Conference, also planned to discuss post-warreconstruction projects in the Persian Gulf nations.   Conference sources said the meetings were also expected to tryand heal the rift between Iran and Saudi Arabia and hopefully talkthe two Islamic powers into resuming diplomatic relations.   Saudi Arabia severed ties with Iran last year to protest allegedIranian attempts to instigate Shiite Moslem supporters to sabotageoil and public utility installations in the kingdom.   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theministers hope to convince Iran and Iraq to accept a simultaneousrelease of all prisoners of war. A U.N.-brokered cease-fire haltedeight years of hostilities between Iran and Iraq on Aug. 20 butpeace talks launched five days later have been deadlocked over theissue of troop withdrawals.   Both countries are members of the Islamic Conference. Tehran senta low-ranking delegation to the meeting.   Conference members, mainly Arab countries, were expected tocriticize Iran's efforts to export its fundamentalist revolution toneighboring nations, the sources said.   The Iranian delegation was expected to appeal to the conference'sforeign ministers to support Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's edicturging Moslems to kill British writer Salman Rushdie for allegedlyblaspheming Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''   Saudi Arabia has criticized Rushdie and banned his book, butwould not support Khomeini's death threat.   Arab diplomatic sources have said the Saudis will resist Iran'sattempts to project Khomeini as defender of Islam. They saidKhomeini was bent on using the Rushdie affair to arouse publicsentiment, hoping to improve unfavorable political conditions athome.   Moslems were offended by a scene in Rushdie's book whereprostitutes take their names after prophet Mohammed's four wives. Inthe novel, Rushdie also suggests that Mohammed wrote the Koran, theholy book of Islam, rather than receiving it directly from God.   The conference sessions were held behind closed doors, and theSaudis were understood to have argued that Khomeini's order onlyportrays Moslems as bloodthirsty and precipitates unnecessary riftswith the West.   Conference sources said the Saudis were to offer a compromiseproposal based on sending conference delegations to Westerncountries to request that Rushdie's book be denounced and banned.   Meanwhile, the Saudi newspaper Okaz reported that the conferencewas to discuss collective action to regain the Arab sector ofJerusalem. Okaz said that Islamic Conference member nations want thesector of Jerusalem occupied by Israel in 1967 to become capital ofa Palestinian state.   The foreign ministers, it said, plan to discuss ways to bolsterthe Palestinian uprising against Israel in the occupied West Bankand Gaza Strip.</TEXT></DOC>
