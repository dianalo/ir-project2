Simpson</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TRINIDAD, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   From the heights of the Andes to thetropical lowlands, Pope John Paul II has carried a message ofself-reliance and prodded Latin Americans to take the initiative insolving their deep social and political problems.   From combating drug trafficking and corruption to stemming the``brain drain,'' the pope has argued that it is up to the peoplethemselves to do battle.   Addressing a Mass on Saturday in the Amazon basin city ofTrinidad, the pope insisted that ``constant, intense, honest andefficient work by everyone'' was needed to overcome poverty.   ``We can't expect everything from outside,'' he said.   The 12-day tour of Uruguay, Bolivia, Peru and Paraguay is JohnPaul's ninth pilgrimage to a region he calls ``the continent ofhope.''   Many people along his route have hoped for his help andblessings. About 20 women occupied a Roman Catholic church Saturdayin Lima, Peru, to ask the pope to intercede for leftist rebels heldin prison.   The group occupied the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church, 12 blocksfrom a seminary where the pope was to speak Sunday. Witnesses toldreporters that police took the protesters away in vans. Policeconfirmed the incident but said they had no information on arrests.   John Paul was scheduled to meet there with priests, nuns andseminary students, as well as celebrate an open air Mass and closea conference of Latin American bishops, before moving on Monday tohis last stop in Paraguay.   The Vatican estimates that half the world's Roman Catholics, whonow number 860 million, will be living in Latin America by the turnof the century.   The pontiff has been greeted here by wildly enthusiastic crowds.Entire cities have turned out to see him. Schoolboys have run afterhis popemobile in motorcades, and schoolgirls have screamed as ifhe were a rock star as he entered a stadium for a youth rally.   The pontiff has avoided blaming the Latin American people fortheir difficulties. At a Mass Friday in tropical Santa Cruz,Bolivia, for example, he lamented the region's ``excessiveeconomic, technological, political and cultural dependence.'' In asocial encyclical issued in March, which he often has cited here,the pope blamed many of the Third World's problems on the East-Westsuperpower rivalry.   Meeting with unemployed miners in the high Andean city of Oruro,Bolivia, and later addressing a Mass in Santa Cruz, the popedeplored both the excesses of free-market capitalism and Marxism.   But he also said in improvised remarks in Santa Cruz that thekey for Latin Americans in resolving East-West, left-rightdivisions is found ``here, in your human, social and Christianrealities.''   Drug trafficking emerged as a major theme as the pope visitedeastern Bolivia, where cocaine barons ship narcotics to consumersin the United States and Western Europe.   John Paul, while flying to South America, told reporters it wasunfair to punish only poor South American countries for drugtrading. But he challenged his audiences in Bolivia to take on thetraffickers, declaring that the rampant corruption was destroyingtheir society.   The pope insisted that an answer lay in following ethical,Christian values _ not public and private immorality.</TEXT></DOC>
