That day, 11 advertising executives, all friends, decided to cap off five days of fishing in Canada with a raft ride down British Columbia's Chilko River.    The weather was clear, the water sparkling, the scenery breathtaking -- and the trip fatal. Suddenly, the raft hit a rock and turned on its side. The men were flung into the rapids surging over jagged rocks. When it was over, five were dead.    The tragedy stunned the advertising industry. But it also raised troubling questions for industries of all kinds: Was the excursion a business trip or a social outing? How does a company tell the difference? And when is a firm liable for damages -- or for deaths?    Those questions are haunting a lot of companies these days, as business social occasions become more widespread than ever. Millions of employees play in company softball leagues, run intercompany races and work out in company gyms. Firms teach leadership by sending executives, even old and overweight ones, on wilderness courses. And then there are the employees who take clients to ball games or out fishing, or just home for dinner.    Yet the question of liability if something goes wrong in any of these instances has never been hazier.    &quot;We are dealing with a grey area of the law,&quot; says John Kralovec, an attorney with the Chicago law firm of William D. Maddux andamp; Associates, which represents one rafting victim's widow. &quot;There are a lot of question marks.&quot;    Legal experts can point to a few broad guidelines. Courts, they say, generally consider an event a business occasion if attendance is required, if the company benefits from it or if the company pays for it. So, for example, a golf outing with a client may be a business event if it leads to new business for the company.    Yet exceptions are almost as plentiful as rules in this game, and few legal precedents exist in part because companies, afraid of big court judgments, typically rush to settle. In New York recently, two men died of heatstroke in &quot;Manufacturers Hanover Corporate Challenge&quot; races; the 3.5-mile races pit employees from New York area companies against each other.    Do the races count as company functions? It depends on whom you ask.    New York brokerage firm Spear Leeds andamp; Kellogg employed one of the victims. &quot;It is my understanding that (his death) would be covered by workmen's compensation,&quot; which pays for work-related injuries, a company official says. Yet at Glasgal Communications, Northvale, N.J., where the second victim worked, Linda Glasgal, treasurer, says: &quot;Our understanding is that this was an entirely voluntary participation. It was essentially an extracurricular thing.&quot;    Other firms also disagree whether the race -- or a company softball or basketball game -- counts as a business outing. Manufacturers Hanover says it considers company sports to be business events, while American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. says it doesn't. At Time Inc., whose HBO unit has an on-premises gym, a spokesman says: &quot;It depends on the situation. We don't want to be offering flat ground rules that might encourage lawsuits.&quot;    George Priest, a Yale Law School professor, worries the controversy will prompt companies to flee from social events. &quot;The courts are increasingly willing to hold corporations liable for injuries,&quot; he says. &quot;The ultimate implication is it will lead to fewer of these types of activities.&quot;    In most cases involving employees, the business-pleasure dilemma usually revolves around interpretation of workers' compensation laws. The laws vary from state to state, but basically, if an accident is deemed work-related, the company must pay medical and disability expenses. The law can actually be a godsend for a company: Employees who get workers' compensation aren't allowed to sue the company, and benefits are capped. In New York, for example, the family of an employee who dies gets a maximum of $300 a week for an indefinite period.    As a result, victims' lawyers sometimes try to argue that an outing wasn't work-related -- for example by claiming that an event was company-sponsored but voluntary. That lets them sue the company.    &quot;We always try to get around workers' compensation,&quot; says plaintiffs' attorney Richard E. Brown, an associate of San Francisco lawyer Melvin M. Belli. &quot;If you file for it and collect, they have an open and shut case&quot; that prevents a potentially more lucrative lawsuit.    On the other hand, companies and their insurers often interpret &quot;work-related&quot; in extremely broad terms. Fikry S. Gahin, an insurance professor at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, cites the case of a dental assistant injured on a weekend ski trip. She argued successfully that she qualified for workers' compensation because, as he paraphrases her, &quot;when I meet guys at the ski resort and make a comment about their teeth, I always give them the dentist's card.&quot;    In any case, predicting whether courts will deem an event work-related is about as easy as predicting a winning lottery number. Consider two Louisiana cases: Maintenance worker Joe Dennis Jackson drowned while swimming at an employer-sponsored party. Accountant Ronald Palermo drowned while swimming on a company-sponsored recreational trip.    The Louisiana State Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Jackson's death was work-related, but a Louisiana appeals court found that Mr. Palermo's death was not. The reason: In the Jackson case, the court found that party attendance was in effect mandatory, since Mr. Jackson was 16 years old and the party invitation was issued by an adult supervisor. In Mr. Palermo's case, the court decided that the trip was voluntary and that the employer didn't benefit from it.    There are some cases, however, where companies have no hope of invoking workers' compensation laws; that's when accidents involve outsiders.    Television newswoman Jessica Savitch, for example, died in 1983 when the car she was in plunged into a canal; she had just come from dinner with New York Post executive Martin Fischbein, who was driving. Ms. Savitch's estate sued the Post along with Mr. Fischbein's estate, claiming that he was on Post business and noting that the Post leased the car. The Post responded that the two were dating, and their dinner was purely social. The Post eventually settled, shelling out more than $7 million.    Although car insurance was sufficient to cover the damages, the Post was named in the suit &quot;for tactical purposes,&quot; explains Arthur Raynes, the attorney for the Savitch estate. If the case had gone to trial, he says, a jury would have been &quot;more likely to award the full measure of damages against a corporate defendant, rather than against an individual.&quot;    A similar case in 1986 involved a fatal accident after a party thrown by Brown-Forman Inc., which makes Jack Daniel's and Southern Comfort whiskey. Donald James, a senior vice president, was among 17 employees who consumed more than 200 drinks, including 175 mixed drinks and six bottles of wine, at the fete. On his way home, he plowed into another car, killing driver Donald Payton.    Mr. Payton's widow sued not only Mr. James but Brown-Forman, claiming that, among other things, company policy encouraged people to drink before driving. Brown-Forman settled for over $1.5 million. The distiller won't comment.    The Chilko rafting disaster is more complex, as the accident involved both employees and outsiders. Two of the five men who died worked for ad agency DDB Needham Worldwide; a DDB executive had arranged the trip. The other three men killed were outsiders.    Evidence could support either side. On one hand, the invitation was issued on DDB stationery, and DDB apparently paid for at least part of the trip. On the other hand, participants apparently signed waivers before the trip. DDB in public statements after the accident clearly referred to the trip as a pleasure outing, &quot;a chance for friends to get together, to trade stories, to fish, to float and most of all to have fun,&quot; as one DDB executive told Advertising Age at the time.    DDB Needham won't comment, but one lawsuit against it has already been filed. Nancy Goldstein, widow of Procter andamp; Gamble Co. executive Robert V. Goldstein, alleges in a $20 million suit against DDB and its parent, Omnicom Group Inc., that the executive who arranged the trip &quot;was acting within the scope and authority of his employment.&quot; The suit, filed in federal district court in Cincinnati, charges the agency with &quot;gross, willful, reckless and wanton misconduct&quot; for arranging a trip it &quot;knew or should have known was exceedingly dangerous.&quot;    Unless the case is settled out of court, it may yet establish a precedent that helps define the difference between business and pleasure. Says Stanley Chesley, the Cincinnati attorney representing Mrs. Goldstein: &quot;It's a fine line distinction, and ultimately a jury will decide.&quot;    ---                      Business or Social?
