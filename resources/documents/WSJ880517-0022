Garcia (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> TRENTON, N.J.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Saul Cooperman agreed to become New Jersey's education commissioner six years ago, he never imagined he might have to sack a school superintendent and dismiss a school board.    But now those actions appear imminent -- and perhaps unavoidable: New Jersey is preparing to test its new law that allows the state to seize control of a school district and run it when the district fails to meet minimum education standards. If, as widely expected, Mr. Cooperman decides in the next few days to take over the district in the blue-collar community of Jersey City, the state will be the first to take such a drastic step.    Jersey City's problems, like those of many inner-city school districts around the country, go way back. The list is long and familiar: chronically poor academic performance, teen pregnancies, drug and alcohol abuse, high absenteeism and dropout rates, alleged mismanagement of state funds, and a political patronage system for appointing teachers and principals.    New Jersey has had the legal power since January to take over in such cases. Texas, Georgia, Kentucky, Arkansas and South Carolina have similar laws, but none is close to a showdown test, so a New Jersey takeover could set an important -- and risky -- precedent. Officials here see the prospective takeover as a natural extension of New Jersey's school monitoring process that began 11 years ago. But assuming responsibility for the day-to-day management of a city's schools would put the turnaround burden squarely on the state.    Indeed, if state agents can correct major problems in Jersey City's schools, their program could become a national model. But if the seizure fails, it could be a costly embarrassment for Gov. Thomas H. Kean's administration, which has tried to be an innovator in education.    &quot;It will be government under glass,&quot; acknowledges the 53-year-old Mr. Cooperman. &quot;There are going to be people putting banana peels in front of us every step of the way.&quot;    The passage of the New Jersey law was preceded by a bitterly partisan battle that dragged on for more than two years. And the controversy is still far from over. Jersey City vows to fight any attempt by the state to seize its schools. Officials of the district, the second largest in the state, contend that some of the problems the state uncovered in a preliminary investigation last year already have been corrected.    The state takeover law &quot;is misdirected legislation,&quot; says Franklin Williams, the district's embattled superintendent. &quot;This district is moving ahead, and I'm going to stay here until the bitter end.&quot;    But other Jersey City administrators are weary of the battles and want the state to step in. Says John Phillips, president-elect of the local principals' association: &quot;Takeover is the only salvation for the system. We're middle management, and we're being squeezed from the top and the bottom. We have no real authority to run our schools.&quot;    For several years now, the state has scrutinized Jersey City schools. Among New Jersey's 583 school districts, only Jersey City and 10 others failed the state's three-stage monitoring process.    Under that process, school districts are certified for five years if they meet state standards for academic performance, fiscal management, school facilities and ability to carry out such mandatory programs as bilingual education. If they fail the initial review, local officials are asked to design and carry out their own plan to correct the problems. If a district can't resolve them on its own, the state conducts another, more intense, review that can lead to a full-blown investigation and an eventual takeover.    When a takeover occurs, the law gives the state control of the district for at least five years. During that period, state agents function much as trustees would in a bankruptcy or receivership case.    The local superintendent and school board are removed and replaced by a state-appointed superintendent, board and administrative staff. They have authority to set budgets, approve expenditures, repair buildings and build new ones, change the curriculum, open or close schools, and generally hire, lay off and reassign people as necessary. Financing for the district would still come from local property taxes, but state aid would be made available on an accelerated basis to help with the changes.    Jersey City faces a state takeover because the district failed both of the first two stages of the state school monitoring process. A preliminary investigation by the state last summer uncovered a school district in the advanced stages of decline: old school buildings with leaky roofs, poor ventilation and numerous safety-code violations; a badly outdated and poorly coordinated curriculum; alleged misuse of school funds by administrators; the strong influence of political patronage in hiring personnel and running the city's schools.    &quot;The district was failing to govern and manage itself properly,&quot; says Walter McCarroll, head of New Jersey's regional and county services division, which ordered a massive follow-up investigation of Jersey City's schools last September.    Mr. McCarroll sent in a team of state auditors, aided by outside management consultants and accountants. The team produced an 800-page report that Mr. Cooperman is reviewing now. After weighing the evidence, Mr. Cooperman must decide whether to take over the schools or to rule that the district has demonstrated sufficient ability to correct its own problems.    Jersey City is a gritty industrial town across the Hudson River from Manhattan. It is a community with many aging buildings and a large ethnic population. The district's administrators and teachers face some especially tough challenges. For instance, providing bilingual education is a major chore: students in Jersey City grow up speaking one of about 30 languages other than English at home.    But other urban districts in New Jersey have contended with similar obstacles and have managed to show marked improvement. As examples, state officials cite Asbury Park and Camden. Both flunked the state's intense follow-up reviews, but both are now carrying out their own corrective plans.    For Asbury Park and Camden, the threat of a takeover was a strong motivator. Parents in Asbury Park, most of whom are black, were stung by the state's declaration that their children were receiving an inferior education. They mobilized voters last spring and won approval of referenda for $13.2 million to build two new schools.    Even Mr. Cooperman, who was an architect of the takeover law, says he has always believed cities should work out their own problems and the state should only provide assistance. But he was nagged by the question of whether the state was doing enough to help those districts that weren't improving on their own or that were &quot;riddled&quot; with political patronage.    &quot;How can we ensure (change), if we can't control a district?&quot; he asks. &quot;We need the commensurate authority.&quot;    In a recent study on the problems of urban schools, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching offered some strong medicine. It recommended that states help troubled schools identify their problems, set up corrective procedures and hold local officials accountable for their progress. The study even advocated that principals who were no longer effective leaders be fired and that failed schools be closed.    But the foundation stopped short of recommending state takeovers of local districts. Says Ernest Boyers, the foundation's president: &quot;You've confounded the issue by having people arguing over control rather than quality.&quot; A takeover threat is a huge vote of no-confidence for a school district, he reasons. &quot;I'm not so sure that's the right signal to send.&quot;    ---         How Some New Jersey School Districts Compare                  (1986-1987 academic year)                        JERSEY                        RIDGE-                          CITY   CAMDEN   PRINCETON    WOOD Total enrollment       28,865   18,827     2,251     4,738 Minority enrollment    86%      96%        22%       13% Pupils per teacher     15.6     17.3       13.4      15.1 Spending per pupil     $5,457   $4,500     $7,015    $5,733 Passing proficiency   rate                 26%      23%        93%       94% Dropouts               1,063    489        16        24 Source: New Jersey State Department of Education</TEXT></DOC>
