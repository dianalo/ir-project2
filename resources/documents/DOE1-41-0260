The angulardistributions depend in character more on the incident charge state thanon ionic species. A strong forward peaking is found for the 5+ and 7+incident ions, whereas the 6+ ions show a maximum at an angle outsidethe half-Coulomb scattering angle. Oscillatory structure is seen forO/sup 6+/ on He. The general features of the distributions can be understoodon the basis of classical deflection functions for the heavy-particlemotion.</TEXT></DOC>
