His adorable trapeze mini-coats, well-cut buttoned jodhpurpants, beautiful fabrics and excellent cuts, displayed Wednesday,would be good news in any collection for next winter.   Jun Inoue, working under the name ``Jun, July, Auguste,'' isjust the latest Japanese designer trying to make it in Paris.   Kenzo came into his own over 18 years ago, Hanae Mori turnedinto a ``French'' couturiere about 20 years ago, Issey Miyake hasshown in Paris for years, and Rei Kawakubo stunned her audienceswith clothes shot full of holes for ``Comme des Garcons'' more thana decade ago.   Opting for a quiet show in the cellar of his small boutique nearthe Louvre that will open officially next summer, Jun was modestbut hopeful for a big future in Paris and all over the world.   ``Paris is the place to be,'' said Jun, 37. ``I've lived here 15years, and get my inspiration here.''   ``I thought he did a wonderful job,'' said Jean-Paul Gaultier,for whom Jun worked eight years. The way-out wonder boy of Frenchfashion, Gaultier said he liked the details like a shirredmini-dress in soft fabrics worn over a silky turtleneck undershirt.   Inoue's small collection was smart and young in every way. Heled off with well-cut black cuffed shorts worn with a high-waistedlong jacket nipped in by a drawstring with a high waistline, theoutfit topped with a jaunty sailor's beret.   The high waistline, often buckled at the side, was a kind ofsignature for Jun's leggy look that was always paired with matchingor contrasting opaque tights _ exclusive productions for Jun _ andlittle flat suede oxords.   While the gamine mini look was young, there was a lot for womenof all ages who want a bit of originality in their closets. Thesoftly belted trench coats, the checked pants suits with narrowjodhpur-style trousers buttoned up from the ankle could be worn byalmost anyone.   Details can make or break a collection, and Jun found someexcellent touches. His mother-of-pearl buttons with a danglingpearl to doll up dark blazers and coats are not seen anywhere else.   One dress sure to make a hit was a camisole slip-like mininumber with a heavy eyelet embroidered decor on the top and hem,worn with a slinky T-shirt top and contrasting tights. The sameeyelet detail on collars pepped up shortie coats with their flaredskirts.   The fabrics were soft but warm for winter, the colorcombinations autumnal and artistic. Besides navy and black, therewere touches of dusty rose or blue, ochre, khaki and aubergine orburgundy, often worked together in appealing combinations.   One of the real originals in the collection was a brownvelveteen dress shirred around the scoop neckline and at the waist,worn with a silky high-necked green shirt underneath.   For dressier moments, Jun also used chiffon to fashion fly-awayminis over matching tights, beautiful in deep blue and ochre. Otherideas included his strict black tuxedo with narrow chino pants, thejacket lapels made of a ribbon effect over a polka-dotted blouse.   Whether working with taffeta or elasticized wool jersey, Junseemed right at home with his fabrics, showing exquisite tailoringand cut.   ``Jun, July, Auguste'' has Japanese backing by the Five Foxretail group, and they hope to do well in France before startingmarketing in the United States.   The clothes will be manufactured for the French market byChofflet-Style in Moulins in central France, who also make clothesfor well-known names like Paco Rabanne, Azzedine Alaia and PopyMoreni.   Priced around $475 to $700 for a long jacket or coat, theclothes may sound expensive. But by high-quality luxuryready-to-wear standards these days, they're almost a steal foranybody who wants original touches in a fashionable wardrobe.</TEXT></DOC>
