<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-05-0175 </DOCNO><TEXT>Describes design, performance and measurement results of a laboratorygrinding apparatus for assessment of wear resistance of materials. Asabrasive, Camden coal was used in experiments. Materials tested includestandard carbon steel, high chrome cast iron, steel used for pulverizerball bearings and also 5 hard cemented tungsten carbides. Use of triangularshaped disc blades in the rotation apparatus proved to produce more informationon wear than rectangular blades, i.e. values for maximum wear resistance(MWR) and initial drop in wear resistance (IDWR). Graphs and tables presentabrasion test results; microscopic photographs show impact of abrasivequartz particles on disc surfaces. The method is regarded as faster andless expensive than the standard Hardgrove test and any material, bothfor blades and abrasives, can be examined. 3 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
