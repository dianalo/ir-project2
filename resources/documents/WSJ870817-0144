By a 2-1 vote, the judges dismissed a challenge to the FCC policy, saying the suit brought by a coalition of radio and television audience groups didn't present the court with a question it could decide.    At issue is a 1986 FCC policy statement asserting that the agency could waive its usual administrative procedures for the transfer of radio and TV station licenses resulting from tender offers or proxy fights. The groups that brought the suit contend that the FCC doesn't have the authority to waive those procedures.    Judges Abner Mikva and Robert Bork concluded that the court couldn't review the policy, because the suit didn't challenge the FCC's application of the policy in a specific case.    The policy &quot;simply outlines a framework for the commission's exercise of its discretion in the area,&quot; wrote Judge Bork, President Reagan's choice for the Supreme Court. &quot;Indeed, the commission has clearly indicated that it does not intend the policy statement to bind the commission to do anything in any particular proceeding.&quot;    Judge Patricia Wald disagreed, interpreting the policy statement as applicable &quot;to tender offers generally.&quot; In that case, Judge Wald wrote, &quot;it is entirely possible for us to decide this question . . . now.&quot;    Attorneys for the audience groups couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
