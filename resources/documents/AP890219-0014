WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rep. John Lewis, a liberal Democrat and blackveteran of the civil rights wars of the 60s, is willing to put hisenthusiasm for white conservative Republican Jack Kemp in thelanguage understood on the poor street corners of America.   ``He can walk the walk, and he can talk the talk,'' Lewis saidrecently of the Bush administration's housing chief.   Lewis' deliberate use of an expression more familiar in the blackneighborhoods he represents than in the white suburbs that producedKemp was meant to communicate. The meaning was clear: Despite theirdifferences, this man Kemp is OK. He's all right.   Lewis's comment last week came after two days of tramping withthe former pro quarterback through those Atlanta neighborhoods inKemp's first look at inner city problems since becoming secretary ofthe Housing and Urban Development.   Kemp went one-on-one with Atlanta's black leaders and veterans ofthe civil rights struggle of the 1950s and 60s _ such as Lewis,Mayor Andrew Young and the family of the late Martin Luther King Jr._ offering them his own brand of bubbly, irrepressible excitementabout the power of unleashed free enterprise.   All welcomed him warmly and seemed to confirm what Kemp'ssupporters were arguing during his unsuccessfully presidentialcampaign last year: Kemp, architect of the 1981 income tax cuts nowso identified with Ronald Reagan, has a strong reservoir of goodwill among blacks.   ``We have serious problems, as you well understand,'' CorettaScott King, widow of the late civil rights leader, told him. ``Youlift our spirits because you have hope they can be solved.''   Taking control of HUD, Kemp heads a department important forurban blacks because it administers the federal programs for housingand redevelopment of blighted cities _ programs that aredramatically reduced after eight years under President Reagan. Kemphopes to make HUD the catalyst for new incentives to attract privatedevelopment into those same neighborhoods.   Kemp's support among blacks could be of benefit to the newadministration and to the Republican Party, as Bush and newRepublican National Chairman Lee Atwater set out to win blacksupport away from Democrats. And it could benefit Kemp in the future.   ``There's no question that a candidate who can attract thesupport of rock-ribbed conservatives and urban blacks would make onehell of a candidate,'' said Kemp's political consultant, Roger Stone.   Kemp himself tried to sidestep the political questions. ``That istangential,'' he said. ``The best politics is to do a good job.''   Many cite Kemp's background in professional football, where wasquarterback, team captain and president of the players' union, as asource of black support. He has maintained friendships withprominent blacks, and has hired Wendell Wilkie Gunn, a blackconservative and former Reagan White House aide, as his chief ofstaff.   ``He knows his safety and indeed his life depended on the abilityof black linemen,'' said the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, head of theSouthern Christian Leadership Conference.   But it is also due to Kemp's enthusiastic talk about doingsomething to solve the housing problem facing the poor. More thanjust his proposals for enterprise zones and other inducements toattract private business into the inner cities, Kemp has raisedexpectations just by talking about making progress on housing. Thattrait is even more noticeable coming on the heels of a relativeeight-year silence by his predecessor, Sam Pierce.   ``He has the kind of creative mind that I admire,'' Young, aDemocrat and former congressman, said. ``Right now, things are sobad that we've got to work together and solve problems. We can getpartisan aga|wv~)o}9C{gkwg{vk}n</TEXT><NOTE>'Q{^:~o9Wy}Dzs[sO[zO</NOTE><TEXT>   s?C{??O}Owv\{T~s}|w~c9_y}7 new jobwith the highest visibility on domestic policy in theadministration. He was trailed through Atlanta's streets by a busfull of reporters and television cameras. He plans a second tournext week, of homelessness in Northeastern cities.   But Kemp's high visibility and bold talk carries risk.   He is given to sweeping statements and boundless expectations,which Democrats are no doubt recording for replay in four years ifhe falls short.   ``I want to eliminate poverty,'' Kemp told one group in Atlanta.``There's not going to be any homelessness unless we turn our backsand let it happen,'' he told another.   Kemp has acknowledged the need for more affordable housing,without promising any more federal spending to build it. Bush'sbudget proposal for fiscal 1990 contains no new spending on publichousing, and the budget deficit provides little reason for housingadvocates to expect even Kemp can come up with new spendinginitiatives.   Some Democrats have begun to suggest that Kemp, with hisvisibility and big talk, has overplayed his hand.   ``He has clearly upstaged the president, and that is usually notsmart politics,'' Democratic Party spokesman Mike McCurry said.   ``He runs the risk of overpromising himself early,'' McCurryadded. ``He's setting himself up for a long fall.''   Mrs. King seemed to be offering Kemp a similar caution as wellwhen they met with the city's black leaders.   ``From everything we've heard you say, we think you meanbusiness,'' she said. ``If something happens and there is not thefollow through, you're going to have a lot of disappointed people.''</TEXT></DOC>
