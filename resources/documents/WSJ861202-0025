Harris Jr.Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/02/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LSI WIX AFGTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)AEROSPACE (ARO) </IN><TEXT>   AFG Partners renewed its offer to acquire Lear Siegler Inc. for $85 a share, or about $1.44 billion, as Lear Siegler management continued to mull a leveraged buyout or restructuring.    Wickes Cos., which on Nov. 18 backed away from a $93-a-share offer for Lear Siegler, hasn't pressed its bid since then. Wickes's offer is slated to expire Dec. 11. AFG Partners conditioned its new offer on Wickes's failing to complete that offer.    Directors of Santa Monica, Calif.-based Lear Siegler, with interests in aerospace, electronics and automotive products, had scheduled a meeting today to consider a buyout or restructuring as an alternative to Wickes's offer. In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely with borrowed funds that are paid with funds generated by the company's operations or through asset sales.    Wickes had made its friendly offer for Lear Siegler to help its Santa Monica neighbor ward off AFG Partners' initial takeover bid last month. But Wickes, which had signed an agreement to acquire Lear for $1.7 billion, backed off after having problems arranging financing on satisfactory terms. Wickes has declined comment since saying that it was officially continuing efforts to arrange financing, but wasn't optimistic about its chances.    Wickes is involved in building products and retailing and makes apparel and other consumer items. AFG Partners, which owns 4.7% of Lear Siegler's 17.8 million common shares outstanding, was formed by Irvine, Calif.-based AFG Industries Inc. and Wagner andamp; Brown, an oil and gas partnership in Midland, Texas.    When AFG Partners launched its first offer last month, it had accumulated a 9.8% stake in Lear Siegler. But the partnership later moved to sell those shares to Wickes for $93 apiece when Wickes reached its tentative agreement to acquire Lear Siegler at the higher price.    Lear Siegler's board didn't take a position on AFG's initial offer.    AFG Partners yesterday asked Lear's board to consider the renewed offer at today's special meeting, set for 5 p.m. EST. A Lear Siegler spokesman yesterday said Lear is evaluating AFG Partners' letter containing the latest proposal. He declined to comment further.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Lear Siegler shares rose $1.25 to $83. AFG Industries shares closed at $28.375, up 37.5 cents. Wickes shares fell 12.5 cents in American Stock Exchange composite trading to $3.875.    As it had in its first offer, AFG Partners said in yesterday's letter to Lear Siegler's board that it is &quot;prepared to discuss increasing the price if Lear Siegler could demonstrate additional value.&quot; Lear Siegler's net income for the year ended June 30 fell sharply to $55.5 million, or $3.02 a share, on sales of $2.46 billion, although first-quarter earnings this year increased.    The AFG partnership said it would invest $250 million of its own in the proposed acquisition, and has reached a definitive $400 million margin credit agreement with a &quot;major&quot; commercial bank for additional financing. The bank has agreed to help AFG Partners obtain another $450 million through a margin credit syndicate, AFG said. Its investment banker, Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., &quot;is highly confident&quot; that $600 million of additional financing can be arranged for the proposed transaction, AFG Partners said. </TEXT></DOC>
