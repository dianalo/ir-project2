The moves will sharply reduce Varian's costs and itsdependence on military contracts, but require it to take aone-time pretax charge of $74 million for its fiscal thirdquarter ending June 29.</LP><TEXT>   The Palo Alto, Calif., concern currently has about 12,000employees.   The size of the charge was a surprise -- almost twice asbig as what some analysts had expected. But the marketwelcomed the news. Varian's stock rose 87.5 cents, to $26, inNew York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.   &quot;This will boost profits quite dramatically,&quot; said MichaelLauer, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.   Net income at Varian, a diversified high-technologyconcern, has fallen for four consecutive quarters, and inMarch the company named J. Tracy O'Rourke its new chiefexecutive officer and chairman. In a prepared statement, Mr.O'Rourke said the job cuts were dictated by the need toreduce costs and that the operations offered for sale aren'tpart of the company's core businesses, which include medicaltherapy and semiconductor process equipment.   Mr. O'Rourke came to Varian from Rockwell InternationalCorp., where he had a reputation for turning industry trendsto his company's advantage. While president of Allen-BradleyCo., which Rockwell acquired in 1985, Mr. O'Rourke wascredited with helping transform the private electromechanicalconcern with $450 million in annual sales into a $1.4 billionglobal high-tech supplier.   At Varian, Mr. O'Rourke wants to lead &quot;a pared-down&quot;organization that can better manage rapid changes in marketsand technologies. &quot;A number of these activities we plan toexit should repesent interesting opportunities for others,&quot;he said. &quot;But in our particular situation, they proved to bea diversion that was no longer acceptable or affordable.&quot;   Mr. Lauer, the analyst, said he expects Varian to receiveas much as $70 million to $85 million from these operations,which employ about 1,600 people and largely make productspurchased by the military. The operations include ContinentalElectronics in Dallas, TVT Ltd. in Cambridge, England, andtwo units in Northern California that make night-visiongoggles and radiation-resistant semiconductors for themilitary.   Varian hopes to complete the sale of these units, whichaccount for about one-seventh of its annual revenue, by theend of September, when the company ends its fiscal year. Buta spokesman said it could take longer than that to completethe sales and that it was prepared to operate the units untilbuyers were found.   The sale of these operations should help earnings becausethey were expected to have losses of as much as $10 millionthis year, Mr. Lauer said. Varian's profit also will benefitfrom the job cuts, which Mr. Lauer said should save thecompany $20 million in annual costs.   While these savings will ease the pressue on Varian, theywon't take the company out of the woods. The company alsomust improve its pivotal semiconductor equipment operation,which has suffered from weakened demand and troubles infinishing new products.   Mr. Lauer said that because of unsolved technicaldifficulties the company has a backlog of two dozen ordersfor one important product, which is priced at more than $1million. In the area of chip equipment, &quot;what's killing thecompany are technical issues,&quot; he said.   A spokesman for Varian said the company had sold about 30of the machines, but called it a &quot;tough new product.&quot; He said&quot;we believe those problems are getting sorted out . . . thoseare largely behind us now.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
