The purpose of the research is to develop anautomatic longwall mining system which can be controlled accurately fromoutside of the face, and the ultimate goal is to eliminate the need formen at the face. Presently, the field test is being conducted in Yotsuyamamine following success in the performance test carried out on the surface.The Remote Batch Control System for shield supports has been adaptedto operate all supports from the control panel located at the entraceof the face. The remote monitoring and control system of the drum shearerhas also been tested. The system makes it possible to operate the shearereither at the main gate or fully automatically. Productivity and safetywill be substantially improved as these systems remove the need for mento work at the face under severe working conditions with high groundpressure and a hot and humid atmosphere due to increasing mining depth.So far, results of the field test have been satisfactory and these systemswill be effective at operating at faces with a high risk of rock-burst.11 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
