At the urging of the U.S., the Security Councilunanimously adopted a resolution imploring Libya to respondto the demands of U.S., British and French courts that areseeking to put on trial Libyan agents charged with blowing upan American jet in 1988 and a French jet in 1989. Theresolution doesn't specifically demand that Libya extraditethe suspects for trial, but its language clearly represents acall for such a step.</LP><TEXT>   The resolution &quot;strongly deplores&quot; Libya for failing tocooperate with the investigation, and urges Tripoli to&quot;provide a full and effective response.&quot; The resolution,which was approved by the council's 15 members, came afterLibyan officials appeared to deny involvement in thebombings.   Tripoli, which has said it is willing to try the accusedin Libya, isn't likely to comply with the terms of theresolution. If it fails to comply, American officials said,the U.S. and its allies intend to seek soon a follow-upresolution that would impose economic sanctions on Libya.   Thomas R. Pickering, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., calledyesterday's action &quot;a first step in what could be a series ofresolutions,&quot; according to wire service reports. But it isn'tclear how soon sanctions would be sought, or exactly howbroad they would be, officials said. Decisions on the timingand breadth of sanctions will depend in part on how Libyaresponds to yesterday's resolution, they said.   U.S. officials once thought the evidence of Libyaninvolvement in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 overLockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people were killed, and the1989 bombing of a French airliner over North Africa, in which170 people died, could lead to the imposition of widespreadeconomic sanctions, possibly including an embargo onpurchases of Libyan oil. But it now isn't clear that there isbroad international support for such sweeping action.Sanctions, if they are adopted, could be limited to aninternational ban on civil aviation links with Libya and anembargo on sales of aircraft and aircraft spare parts to thecountry.   In any event, U.S. and allied officials decided to avoidseeking any sanctions now, calculating that internationalsupport would be higher after passage of an initialresolution giving Libya clear warning.   American and European anger against Tripoli has risen inrecent months. In November, the U.S. and Britain indicted twoLibyan agents for the Pan Am bombing. Earlier, France issuedwarrants for four Libyans in the bombing of the Frenchairliner.   With support for terrorist actions apparently receding inSyria, Iraq and Iran, U.S. officials have been eager to moveagainst Libya, which also has traditionally sponsoredterrorist organizations. By clamping down on Libya now, U.S.officials hope to put a long-term crimp in the Middle Eastterrorism network that flourished in the 1970s and 1980s.   But even if the Bush administration succeeds inorchestrating a move against Libya now, it likely will becriticized for its handling of the issue. The families of thevictims of the Pan Am 103 bombing are upset at the slow paceof the effort to penalize Libya. And they charge that theadministration has turned a blind eye to Syrian and Iraniancomplicity in planning related terrorist attacks that led tothe Pan Am bombing.</TEXT></DOC>
