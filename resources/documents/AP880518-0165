Researchers released sulfur dioxide into a cloud that coveredthe top of a British hill, and measurements showed it reacted withnatural hydrogen peroxide, according to a report in Thursday'sissue of the British journal Nature.   The rate of reaction was comparable to that expected fromlaboratory experiments, they wrote.   The reaction produces sulfate, which reacts with atmosphericmoisture to form sulfuric acid, a constituent of acid rain.   Little sulfate was detected in the experiment, which wasperformed in December 1985. But significant levels appeared whenthe experiment was done in springtime, when more sun was availableto promote sulfur dioxide reactions, researchers wrote.   Acid rain also can include nitric acids formed from pollutantscalled nitrogen oxides. It can harm vegetation and acquatic life,and damage buildings and monuments.</TEXT></DOC>
