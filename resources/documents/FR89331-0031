Gatewood, (202) 632-5056.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> Federal agencies currently have authorityto determine a General Schedule employee's rate of basic pay upon reemployment,transfer, reassignment, promotion, demotion, or change in type of appointment.In the exercise of this authority, agencies are governed by the ``maximumpayable rate rules'' found in 5 CFR 531.203(c).  OPM has determined that agencies should have greater flexibility to determinean employee's rate of basic pay when the employee is reassigned withinthe employing agency from a special rate position to a nonspecial rateposition under the General Schedule. The numbers and kinds of positionscovered by special rates have increased significantly over the past severalyears. Employees receiving special rates of pay represent a valuable resourceto the organizations for which they work. Many employees receiving specialrates of pay also have capabilities and potential needed by the organizationbeyond the skills used in the special rate positions to which they areassigned. However, agencies are reluctant to offer reassignments to employeeswhen the reassignment from a special rate position to a nonspecial rateposition would mean a loss of the special rate of pay.  Under current regulations, agencies are permitted to use an employee'sspecial rate of pay as the basis for setting pay upon reassignment to anonspecial rate position only with prior written approval by OPM. Whilethis procedure ensures the integrity of the special rates program, it alsoprevents organizations from considering employee reassignments to resolveimmediate staffing problems, and it may contribute to delays in programand mission accomplishment.  OPM now finds that there are good reasons to add this pay-setting authorityto the other pay-setting authorities already delegated to agencies. Underthe proposed regulations, agencies would be permitted to make the determinationto use a special rate as an employee's highest previous rate when reassigningemployees to nonspecial rate positions in the same agency. An officialdesignated to make such determinations would be required to find that theneed for the services of the employee, and his or her contribution to theprogram of the agency, will be greater in the position to which he or sheis being reassigned. In addition, the special rate of pay must be the employee'scurrent rate of pay, and the employee must have held the special rate positionfor 120 calendar days or more. In the event an agency determines not touse a special rate as an employee's highest previous rate, the proposedregulations provide an alternative means of determining the basis for theemployee's highest previous rate (5 CFR 531.203(d)(3)).  In an effort to clarify and simplify the highest previous rate provisionsof the regulations, OPM also proposes to make certain other changes inthese regulations. For example, we are proposing to revise the definitionof ``highest previous rate'' to make it clear that agencies have the authorityto use the rate of basic pay for the highest grade and step held in a GeneralSchedule position, even when that rate is not the highest actual rate ofbasic pay ever received by the employee.   In addition, we are proposing to revise the procedure for determining themaximum payable rate for Performance Management and Reconciliation System(PMRS) employees. We want to make it clear that if the employee's highestprevious rate was less than or equal to the minimum rate for the gradein which pay is being set, the employee is paid the minimum rate for thenew grade. If, on the other hand, the employee's highest previous ratewas within the rate range of the grade in which pay is being set, a two-stepprocedure is used for calculating the employee's maximum payable rate.The first step in this procedure (5 CFR 531.203(c)(2)(ii)) is used to determinethe employee's relative position in the former rate range. The second stepin this procedure (5 CFR 531.203(c)(2)(iii)) is used to determine the maximumpayable rate itself. In addition, the proposed regulations would make itclear that the maximum payable rate rules do not authorize the paymentof a rate greater than the maximum rate for the grade in which pay is beingset.Finally, we propose to make certain additional changes in the rules governingthe basis for an employee's highest previous rate. These changes include(1) a requirement that an employee must have actually held a position forat least 120 days before the rate of basic pay for that position can beused as the employee's highest previous rate; (2) a prohibition againstusing a rate earned during a temporary promotion of less than 1 year; (3)a prohibition against using a rate earned in a position from which theemployee was reassigned or reduced in grade because of failure to completea supervisory probationary period; (4) a prohibition against using a ratereceived under a void appointment; and (5) a prohibition against usinga rate received by an employee of the government of the District of Columbiawho was first employed by that government on or after October 1, 1987.(Agencies should note that the current regulations continue to permit theuse of a rate paid to an individual while employed in a position in thegovernment of the District of Columbia. The proposed regulations wouldprohibit only the use of a rate received by an individual first employedin such a position on or after October 1, 1987, the date on which newlyhired DC government employees became subject to newly established DC governmentretirement and leave systems.)<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities, since they apply only to Federalemployees and agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 531</ITAG>Government employees, Wages, Administrative practice and procedure.<ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, OPM proposes to amend Part 531 of Title 5 of the Code of FederalRegulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 531_PAY UNDER THE GENERAL SCHEDULE</ITAG>1.
