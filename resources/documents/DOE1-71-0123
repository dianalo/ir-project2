Ceramics with electronic functions.(1) ZnO varistors are made up of ZnO to which various auxiliary componentsare added to improve the non-linear characteristics. No definite theoryis available about the effect of additives on the development of non-linearcharacteristics. (2) PTC thermistors -- the PTC effect caused by additivesis believed to have close bearing on the phase transition of the crystal.Further investigation is also necessary about this subject. 2. Ceramicswith thermal functions. (1) SiC ceramics -- recently, a technique ofadding BeO to SiC and sintering the mixture with a hot press to achievehigh density has been developed; as a result, materials with high electricinsulation and thermal conductivity are now available. (2) AIN ceramics-- sintering under low-temperature, ordinary-pressure condition is possiblewith sintering aids. 3. Ceramics with optical functions. A typical exampleis transmissive piezoelectric ceramics. (8 figs, 3 tabs, 8 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
