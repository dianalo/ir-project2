Independent reports said 19 people _ including two who died _were brought to Ikeja General Hospital with gunshot wounds. Therewas no official comment on the riots.   The clashes were the most violent in the capital since studentsbegan rioting a week ago to protest a government austerity plan andschool policies.   Wednesday's demonstrations began when the government ordered twoLagos universities and four technical schools closed to protectlife and property in the port city.   Students took to the streets, and witnesses said market womenand unemployed youth helped them erect barricades around governmentbuildings to stop civil servants from going to work. Workers whomanaged to enter the buildings later were chased away by therioters.   By noon the streets of the sprawling city were full of rioters,including schoolchildren and traders who closed their stores.   Police tried to disperse the demonstrators, who chanted slogansagainst President Ibrahim Babangida's economic policies and peltedofficers with stones. But when they were chased from the streets,officers used helicopters to fire on the rioters.   The state-run Daily Times newspaper said troops will guard allstrategic installations in the country against demonstrators.   The protests began on May 24 at universities in the midwesterncity of Benin, about 160 miles east of Lagos and since have spreadto campuses nationwide.   The government has closed 13 schools, and police have arrestedmore than 200 students in Benin and Lagos alone, according tonewspaper reports. At least six people, including a police officer,have been reported killed.   The protesters oppose a government austerity program demanded byWestern creditors. The program has caused sharp rises in the priceof some basic foods and services.   Some students also have demanded changes in Nigeria's universitysystem, including the abolition of tuition fees.   The Daily Times quoted Col. Fred Chijuka, an army spokesman, assaying that students alone were not responsible for the riots.   ``The act cannot be the handiwork of students but hooligans inthe guise of students,'' he said.   In Ibadan, north of Lagos, Oyo state police commissionerArchibong Nkana said police were investigating the death of asecondary school pupil who allegedly was shot to death during ademonstration Monday at the University of Ibadan, the News Agencyof Nigeria reported.   Nkana said the shot could not have been fired by any of his menbecause they were not armed with guns, NAN said.</TEXT></DOC>
