When banks merge, customers may face changes in accountnumbers, services, fees and charges, interest rates andfederal deposit insurance coverage, among other things.Customers of other banks will feel the effects, too, as thoseinstitutions respond to changes in the competition.</LP><TEXT>   Banks generally will do their best to minimize anydisruption -- after all, they're paying a hefty price toacquire more customers and don't want to lose any of them.Still, some confusion is inevitable, banking-industryconsultants and veterans of previous mergers say. Loanpayments may get lost and deposits may be credited to thewrong account, for instance, or checks may be sent to thewrong address.   &quot;Consumers should be very alert to protect their owninterests,&quot; says Edward E. Furash, president of Furash andamp; Co.,a Washington, D.C., consulting firm. A bank merger &quot;isn't thetime to wait a month to open your bank statement.&quot;   Indeed, consumers would do well to open all mail fromtheir bank. Once mergers are under way, banks typically put agreat deal of effort into communication -- telling customerswhat changes are coming and what their options are. Customerscan expect to get letters from the bank, and there often arehandouts at branches with answers to commonly askedquestions.   A bank merger usually takes several months to complete,while the proposed combination awaits regulatory, andsometimes shareholder, approval. But in the meantime, the twobanks have a lot to do; they must review every form and everyfee to make them compatible.   Some recently announced combinations -- ManufacturersHanover Corp. and Chemical Banking Corp. in New York,BankAmerica Corp. and Security Pacific Corp. in California,and NCNB Corp. and Candamp;S/Sovran in the South -- are unusuallylarge, and all the details of what's to come for customershaven't yet been worked out. But there have been dozens ofsmaller bank deals in recent years, particularly as a resultof federally assisted takeovers of troubled banks andthrifts. So it's possible to answer some of the questionsbank customers may have about the changes to come if theirbank merges.                                                                                                          What happens if my branch is closed? Branch closingsfrequently follow a merger, particularly when the twoinstitutions are in the same geographic area. In New York,for instance, Chemical and Manufacturers sometimes havebranches just a block apart. Customers' accounts at a closedbranch usually are transferred to the nearest open one. Yourold branch manager and other personnel may be transferredelsewhere or laid off, though sometimes they may be moved toa nearby branch.                                                                                                          Will my account numbers change? Maybe. Clearly, anyduplicate numbers must be eliminated. In addition, accountnumbers usually include the branch number, which may change.Sometimes, new computer software requires a shorter or longernumber.                                                                                                          Will I need new checks? Banks typically issue new checksafter a merger to reflect a new bank name and account number.But they permit customers to use existing checks for a periodof time. Check numbers on the new checks generally startwhere the old ones left off. Some people don't want newchecks with low numbers, because they think it makes themlook like new customers and less creditworthy, says JackKopec, a San Francisco banking industry consultant.                                                                                                          What about my automated teller machine card? It will bereissued with the new bank name. Sometimes your personalidentification number has to be changed because of newcomputer software. Customers usually can continue to usetheir old cards for a few months. When the merginginstitutions are part of an ATM network, fees fortransactions at the other bank's machines usually are waivedeven before new cards are issued.                                                                                                          What happens to my bank credit card? It, too, will bereissued with a new bank name. The merging banks must agreeon fees and interest rates, if these are different. Bank ofAmerica has said it will issue new Visa and Mastercards toSecurity Pacific cardholders, but fees and interest rateshave yet to be decided.                                                                                                          Will interest rates change? The rates bank charge onexisting loans generally remain the same. Interest rates oncertificates of deposit usually continue until the CDs mature(although when a failed institution is taken over, theacquiring bank has the option of canceling rates). Otherdeposit rates may change sooner. In some mergers, there maybe significant differences in consumer rates. In New York,for example, a one-year CD at Manufacturers Hanover currentlyyields 5.44%, compared with 5.02% at Chemical.                                                                                                          What happens to my federal deposit insurance coverage?Customers who have deposits at both banks will have dualprotection for six months after the merger takes effect, or,for CDs, until the first maturity date after the end of thesix-month period. Let's say, for instance, that someone has$75,000 on deposit at Bank of America and $65,000 at SecurityPacific. The entire $140,000 would be covered by the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. until six months after the merger iscompleted. If some of that is in a CD that matures before thesix months is over, it could be rolled over into a new CD ofthe same amount and the same maturity and would be insured.   But eventually, a customer with more than $100,000 in themerged bank may want to move some of the money to anotherinstitution to keep full FDIC coverage. (In some cases, themoney can be moved into a joint account or trust account atthe bank and be fully covered.)   When banks merge, they often establish telephone hotlinesto answer consumers' questions and usually do their best tosatisfy consumers' needs. &quot;You bend over backwards not to get{customers} upset,&quot; says Mr. Kopec, the consultant. &quot;Thecompetition is just sitting there waiting for you to messup.&quot;   Although yields on deposits may fall and fees and chargesmay rise in response to reduced competition, industrywatchers say dramatic changes are unlikely. &quot;There are otherinstitutions wooing customers,&quot; says Robert K. Heady,publisher of several bank-industry newsletters in North PalmBeach, Fla. He notes that money-market mutual funds arealready attracting huge amounts of savers' cash, and phonecompanies and department stores are offering alternatives tobank credit cards.   Indeed, some analysts say the rash of bank mergers mayeventually benefit consumers. &quot;Banks will be providing abigger variety of financial services, and the way to playthat game is provide better value than others,&quot; says James M.McCormick, president of consulting firm FMCG in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
