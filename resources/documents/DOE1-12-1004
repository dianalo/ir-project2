So that theprepared gas from a refuse tip can be fed into the natural gas H networkas a replacement gas, the treatment must be such that the gas characteristicsof the final gas, which describe the combustion and physical propertiesand determine the combustion behaviour, are identical with those of thebasic gas.</TEXT></DOC>
