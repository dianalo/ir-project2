Within the overall figures, the Finance Ministry said yesterday, Japan's surplus in trade with the U.S. shrank from a year earlier, while its surpluses grew with the European Community and the newly industrialized countries of Asia. Those two regions are replacing the U.S. as Japan's growth market for exports.    The narrowing of Japan's huge trade surplus during most of last year, largely a result of the weak dollar, has helped ease trade frictions with the nation's trading partners, especially the U.S. Any new surge in the surplus would be bound to exacerbate tensions, especially in the U.S. presidential-election year.    In its report, the Finance Ministry said the total surplus contracted to $3.07 billion in January from $4.31 billion a year earlier. But after seasonal adjustment, the surplus grew to $7.76 billion from $6.36 billion in December.    Helped by strong demand for machinery and electrical appliances, Japan's exports rose 16% from a year earlier, to $17.27 billion. Imports increased a faster 34%, to $14.20 billion, led by purchases of iron ore and building materials. After seasonal adjustment, exports rose 7.6% from December, to $22.09 billion, while imports rose 1.1%, to $14.33 billion.    William P. Sterling, senior economist with Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, said the 29% shrinkage in the overall surplus from a year earlier was &quot;good news,&quot; showing that the slow but steady erosion evident since last May is continuing. But, he added, &quot;The bad news is that on a seasonally adjusted basis, the figures are pretty terrible.&quot;    January's 22% month-to-month growth in the seasonally adjusted surplus followed a 28% increase in December. The sharp increases trouble economists because they suggest that in the long term, the trade surplus may reverse course and start expanding again.    When January's seasonally adjusted surplus is annualized, it produces a full-year surplus of $93 billion, which would be up from $79.83 billion last year.    &quot;It's not going in the right direction,&quot; said Ron Napier, an economist with Salomon Brothers in Tokyo. &quot;That could spell trouble later for the exchange rates.&quot; Any worsening in the trade imbalance would threaten to push the already-weak dollar even lower against the yen.    But the January figures alone probably will have minimal financial-market impact. The Japanese report came on the heels of Friday's announcement in Washington that the overall U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $12.20 billion in December from $13.22 billion in November. Economists called the U.S. data generally favorable.    The Finance Ministry released yesterday's figures one hour later than usual, which meant they were announced half an hour after the Tokyo Stock Exchange had closed. The ministry was acting under a new policy meant to minimize the trade figures' market impact. Nevertheless, accurate trade figures were bandied about all day, apparently based on leaked information, traders said.    The Nikkei stock average rose 225.53 points yesterday, to 24,207.47. The dollar closed at 131 yen in Tokyo, down from 131.95 yen in late New York trading Friday.    Here is a breakdown of the surplus by three major regions:   --The surplus with the U.S. declined 9.4% in January from a year earlier, to $2.97 billion from $3.28 billion. Exports to the U.S. rose 4.2%, to $5.83 billion, while the U.S. sent Japan $2.86 billion in goods, up 23%.    --The surplus with the EC grew 17% from the year before, to $1.82 billion from $1.56 billion. Exports to the 12-nation group rose 20%, to $3.43 billion, while imports increased 11%, to $1.61 billion.    --The surplus with South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, Asia's &quot;four tigers,&quot; widened 34%, to $1.3 billion from $970 million a year earlier. Exports gained 41%, to $3.06 billion, while imports gained 46%, to $1.76 billion.    ---   U.S. Warns Japan on Beef   Special to The Wall Street Journal   TOKYO -- The U.S. has threatened to take its case against Japanese import curbs on beef and oranges to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an official at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery said.    Escalating a dispute that has brought the two sides to an impasse, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith told Hidero Maki, director of the ministry's Economic Affairs Bureau, in Washington last week that the U.S. will file a petition with GATT unless Japan lifts import quotas for the products in the fiscal year starting April 1, Mr. Maki said.    Mr. Maki returned from the U.S. over the weekend after trying to reach an agreement with Mr. Smith on the issue. The talks have remained stalled, with the U.S. demanding a timetable for abolishing the quotas and Japan insisting that the most it can offer is an increase in them.    Earlier this year, a GATT panel ruled against Japanese restrictions on imports of 10 other agricultural products. Some analysts speculate the U.S. might win its case against beef and orange quotas if it again appeals to the Geneva-based trade group. </TEXT></DOC>
