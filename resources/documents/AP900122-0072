The court, without comment, let stand rulings that upheld the10-year-old court consent decree.   The dispute dates back to a 1977 lawsuit by inmates of thestate's penitentiary, at the time New Mexico's only prison. Thesuit challenged prison conditions and practices as unconstitutional.   A partial settlement was agreed to in 1979. A broader agreementbetween prison authorities and inmates was reached several monthsafter 33 inmates were killed a February 1980 riot at thepenitentiary.   The 1980 court-approved pact, which covered all future prisonsand inmates as well, set standards for numerous aspects of prisonlife.   Some of the standards, such as those governing food services andmedical care, were not challenged by state officials.   But others were attacked in a 1987 request seeking to modify the1980 agreement.   Specifically, state officials objected to these requirements:   _Inmate security classifications must be made by a three-membercommittee representing a prison's psychological, program andsecurity staffs with participation by the individual inmate.   _Maximum security may be used only for inmates who havecommitted or been linked to particular acts involving prisonsecurity.   The state's appeal said the requirement makes maximum security``unavailable for known gang leaders who have not themselvesengaged in recent misconduct.''   _Inmates may be punished only for certain designated offensesand only for specified lengths of time, never exceeding 30 days.   _All inmates except those in maximum security must receive``eight hours a day of meaningful activity,'' to include vocationaltraining, education and work.   _No prison may use ``double-celling,'' or putting more than oneinmate in any cell, except in the face of dire emergencies such asriots or fires, regardless of the cell's size. Dormitories mustprovide 60 square feet for each inmate.   _Liberal visitation policies must be used, including allowingkissing and embracing when feasible.   U.S. District Judge Juan G. Burciaga in 1988 turned down thestate's request to modify the consent decree, and the 10th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his ruling last Sept. 15.   In the appeal acted on today, New Mexico Attorney General HalStratton argued, ``The issues in this case vitally affect theability of the states to administer their ... prisons free fromlong-term, day-to-day federal court control over matters notgoverned by federal law.''   The state's appeal called the 1980 consent decree ``outmoded''because more recent high court rulings make clear that the decree'sstandards ``go far beyond any federal law requirements.''   The appeal was supported in a ``friend-of-the-court'' brieffiled by 39 states and Puerto Rico.   The case is Carruthers vs. Duran, 89-786.</TEXT></DOC>
