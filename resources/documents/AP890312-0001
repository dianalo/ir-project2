The State Department, in a statement released to the AssociatedPress on Sunday, also said the U.S. government never hired aself-proclaimed CIA agent who made the allegation.   A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy, who requested anonymity,said the statement was given to the state-run television and radionetworks Saturday, but by mid-day Sunday it had received no airplay.   Premier Andreas Papandreou's party, the Panhellenic SocialistMovement (PASOK), faced a censure vote Monday brought by theconservative opposition on grounds the government's allegedinvolvement in a $200-million fraud, forgery and embezzlementscandal threatens the country's security.   PASOK, with 157 seats in the 300-single chamber Parliament, wasexpected to weather the motion during a voice vote.   The purported agent, Tom Mailis, told a parliamentaryfact-finding committee last week that fugitive banker GeorgeKoskotas was a CIA employee trying to destabilize Greece'sgovernment.   Koskotas is jailed in Massachusetts pending an extraditionhearing. He faces charges in Greece in connection with the scandal.   ``The United States government categorically states that thereported allegations of Mr. Tom Mailis concerning his connectionswith the U.S. government are completely without foundation,'' saidthe State Department statement released through the U.S. Embassy inAthens.   The statement, issued ``as an exception to our general policy ofnot commenting on such matters,'' added that ``neither he nor theothers he reportedly has alleged to work for the CIA now work orever have worked for the CIA.''   On Saturday, Papandreou threatened the United States that therewould be ``consequences'' if banker-publisher George Koskotas wasnot quickly extradited to Greece.   Speaking before Parliament during a debate on the censure motion,Papandreou did not describe the ``consequences'' but made areference to his government's decision to shut down one of four U.S.military installations in Greece.   He said talks on a new U.S. bases agreement were continuing,``but their (bases) time of stay in Greece is running out daily.''   The main conservative opposition New Democracy Party submittedthe censure motion Thursday on the grounds that alleged governmentinvolvement in the scandal posed a ``danger for democracy andGreece.''   Koskotas, 34, former chairman of the Bank of Crete, fled Greecein November after being indicted in the scandal. He is jailed inSalem, Mass.   Time magazine, in an interview with the banker, quoted him assaying Papandreou and senior government officials allegedlyauthorized plans to embezzle millions from his bank. He also claimedthey received millions of dollars in payoffs.   Papandreou, who said he will sue Time for running the interviewin its March 13 issue, has charged that there is a ``foreign anddomestic plot'' to overthrow his government.   To back up the premier's claims of an international conspiracyagainst him, the state-run television networks and pro-governmentpress have played up the allegations made by Mailis to aparliamentary fact-finding committee investigating the scandal.</TEXT></DOC>
