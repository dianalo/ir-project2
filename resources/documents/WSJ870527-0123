Political concerns, though, helped depress most other London stocks.    In moderate trading in Frankfurt, the dollar's climb helped relieve some concern about further damage to West German exports. Investors maintained a cautious attitude, though, brokers said.    In hectic Frankfurt currency trading, the dollar broke through a key psychological barrier of 1.8 marks and was fixed at 1.7963 marks, up more than a pfennig from Monday's 1.7836.    The stock market's &quot;turnover was better, especially in the chemicals and even the banks,&quot; said a senior analyst at a big West German bank. &quot;But it still has a long way to go before we're satisfied.&quot;    Auto makers did especially well, with Daimler-Benz up 12 marks at 979 marks ($545.01) and Bayerische Motoren Werke up 5 at 577. Volkswagen rose 9 to 368.5. While the company said profit fell 1.4% in the first quarter from a year earlier, it said sales improved 4.8%.    Banks continued to rebound from last week's concern about their Latin American debt exposure, with Deutsche Bank up 4.5 to 587, Dresdner Bank up 3.8 at 307.8 and Commerzbank advanced 2.5 to 247.    Chemical issues also did well, with Bayer up 5 at 308, Hoechst up 4.9 at 276.8 and BASF up 4.1 to 276.8.    Electrical-products maker Siemens rose 5.5 to 687.5, and AEG was up 4.5 at 312.    Machinery-maker Linde pushed ahead 4 to 667 after the company said it was raising its bid for the tiny French gas concern, Duffour andamp; Igon. The move revives an international bidding war.    Some Tokyo export-led issues surged, although the overall market changed little in mixed trading.    The Nikkei stock average, which rose in the previous four sessions, eased 1.9 points to 24580.87. The first section index fell 3.56 to 2146.4. Turnover came to about 820 million shares, up from 680 million Monday. Gaining issues managed to outnumber losers, 459 to 434, while 136 were unchanged.    Export-led issues benefited from the dollar's performance as the U.S. currency rose to an intraday high of 142.2 Japanese yen in Tokyo while stocks were trading. Investment trusts were said to be leading the buying of export-led shares in the expectation they will reassert themselves as market leaders.    However, a broker said, uncertainty about the financial implications of the June 8 Venice summit of the seven leading industrialized democracies were keeping many investors on the sidelines.    &quot;People aren't sure where to invest,&quot; she said.    Among export-led electrical and computer issues, Kyocera soared 420 yen to 4750 yen ($33.73), TDK advanced 210 to 3310, Toshiba rose 20 to 760, Sony moved up 90 to 2910, NEC gained 100 to 1780, and Japan Victor Company jumped 180 to 2280.    Among auto makers, Toyota was up 70 at 1790 and Honda was up 20 at 1340.    Profit-taking struck issues related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which climbed Monday.    London stocks were hurt by lack of interest after the three-day holiday weekend, the pound's steep slide and results of a political opinion poll.    The 100-share index fell 14.1 points to 2153.4. The Financial Times 30-share index was down 8.9 at 1677.8.    Although the pound's slide against the dollar and mark triggered concern that interest rates will rise, a dealer said, it also helped export-led issues.    &quot;Post-bank holiday apathy,&quot; however, depressed much of the market, a dealer said.    Meanwhile, there was some concern about the results of a political opinion poll released in the morning showed that the ruling Conservative Party leads the opposition Labor Party by just five percentage points ahead of Britain's June 11 general election. Before the election was called, many expected the Tories to maintain a sizable margin.    The poll surveys more than 1,000 people and changes one-quarter of its sample each day, although some dealers discount its results because of its small sample.    Meanwhile, Racal and Plessey announced a joint venture to develop and manufacture radio-telephone equipment for a pan-European network expected to start up in 1991. Racal was down 3 pence at 249 pence ($4.16), and Plessey was down 6 at 215.    Swiss stocks benefited from the dollar's strength, which boosted prospects for Switzerland's export-dependent economy, and prompted buying by foreign investors, traders and brokers said. Gains were made across the board, with banking and industrial issues performing the best.    Amsterdam concentrated on a few Dutch blue-chips, dealers said, as the dollar's firmness spurred advances by most international issues. Many investors were cautious, though, waiting to see how Wall Street reacts to the dollar's performance, dealers said.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                    % This                              May 25    May 22      Year    U.S. ..................... 263.0     263.0     + 15.3    Britain .................. 648.1     648.1     + 30.2    Canada ................... 405.7     406.0     + 21.8    Japan ................... 1301.0    1273.5     + 37.7    France ................... 432.4     427.3     +  5.9    Germany .................. 213.7     214.5     - 17.8    Hong Kong ............... 2092.2    2063.4     + 17.6    Switzerland .............. 177.8     177.8     - 11.5    Australia ................ 333.0     337.6     + 26.2    World index .............. 462.3     459.2     + 29.6</TEXT></DOC>
