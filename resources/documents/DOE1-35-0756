In this invention, by cutting thestrip of metal substrate by a press cutter with the light-receiving surfacefacing upward leaving an element on a pedestal of the cutter as a product.This process eliminated the above-mentioned demerit. The cut-out portionof the cut-down element contains a degraded electric characteristics,which, however, enables to recover the portion of its electric characteristicswhich is usable as a product, when the cut-down element is placed ona press cutter in the position so that the part can be a free end andis cut down.
