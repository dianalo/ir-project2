(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Authorities said they found a noteasking God's forgiveness inside a man's blood-splattered car hoursafter he killed five people and shortly before he slit the throatsof his three young daughters.   Other new details also emerged about the bloody rampage in whichseven people died, including allegations that winery worker RamonSalcido had tried to kill the wife of a co-worker but his gunjammed.   Salcido continued to elude authorities today as a 5-day-oldmanhunt stretched from Canada to Mexican.   The note written in Spanish was found inside the car along witha .22-caliber semi-automatic pistol and Salcido's Social Securitycard, according to documents filed Monday in federal court in SanFrancisco.   ``Forgive me God, but this law made me do it. We could livebetter, me and my children but what can I do,'' said the note filedin support of an FBI request for a warrant charging Salcido withunlawful flight to avoid prosection. A magistrate granted thewarrant.   Officials did not say what ``this law'' meant, but Salcidoreportedly was upset by a court order last week to pay nearly$6,000 in overdue child support and to make monthly payments of$511 for a 4-year-old daughter in Fresno.   Police found the car Friday afternoon in a San Rafael alley,about 15 miles south of Petaluma, near where his daughters werefound Saturday.   Police believe two of the girls were slain Friday night and leftat a trash dump. Salcido's 3-year-old daughter, Carmina, surviveddespite having her throat slashed from ear-to-ear.   Carmina, listed in stable condition at Petaluma Valley Hospital,was asked by a detective what occurred at the dump: ``Cut her, cuther twice,'' the girl said, making a slicing motion with her handacross her throat, according to the documents.   The detective then asked if her father did it. She responded,``Yeah, yeah,'' and began to cry. Five minutes later, she saidspontaneously, ``Dad hurt me,'' according to the court papers.   Carmina is under armed guard at the hospital, where giftscontinued to pour in.   Her 28-year-old father _ described by some as friendly and goodworker and by others as an insanely jealous heavy drinker who usedcocaine and toted a gun _ has not been positively sighted despitehundreds of calls from across California and as far away as Maine,authorities said.   Murder charges were filed Monday in Sonoma County againstSalcido in connection with the slayings of his wife, Angela, 24,and daughters Sofia, 4, and Teresa, 1, and of co-worker TracyToovey.   The court papers said 33-year-old Kenneth Butti, who survived anattack outside his ranch Friday, told a detective Salcido had triedto shoot Butti's wife but the gun malfunctioned.   Butti said ``he could hear the click as the hammer fell, butthat there was no explosion,'' according to the court papers.   No charges have been filed in the three other slayings, ofSalcido's mother-in-law, Marian Louise Richards, 47, and herdaughters, Ruth, 12, and Marie, 8. Authorities believe they, Mrs.Salcido and Toovey were killed Friday morning.   Although photos and descriptions of the 5-foot-9, 180-poundSalcido have been circulated at California airports and borderguards, Sonoma County Sheriff Richard Michaelsen speculated Salcidohasn't strayed far.   ``My best guess is that he's laying low,'' said Michaelsen.``We're assuming he's in our county or in Marin County. He may beholed up waiting for the media attention to ease up.''   However, FBI spokesman Chuck Latting acknowleged that Salcido,who entered the United States illegally but is a legal resident,could try to slip back to his native Mexico.   To aid the search, a $15,000 reward has been posted.   The uncertainty and the slayings have left many county residentstense.   ``People are real scared around here,'' said Dorothy McCann, agrocery store clerk who lives in Glen Ellen with her boyfriend.``We have a loaded gun in the cupboard. People are just looking ateach other.''</TEXT></DOC>
