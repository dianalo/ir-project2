<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-70-0501 </DOCNO><TEXT>The two major effects from the interaction of e{sup {minus}}e{sup +} beams---beamstrahlungand disruption---are reviewed, with emphasis on flat beam collisions.For the disruption effects we discuss the luminosity enhancement factor,the maximum and rms disruption angles, and the ``kink instability''.All the results are obtained from computer simulations, and scaling lawsbased on these are deduced whenever possible. For the beamstrahlung effects,we concentrate only on the final electron energy spectrum and the deflectionangle associated with low energy particles. In addition to the genericstudies on the beam-beam effects, we also list the relevant beam-beamparameters obtained from simulations on two sample designs: the TLC andthe ILC. As an addendum, the newly discovered phenomenon of coherentbeamstrahlung pair creation, together with the incoherent process, arediscussed. 18 refs., 15 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
