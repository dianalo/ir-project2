A modelof a lithium hydride phase change energy storage system was used to estimatereasonable physical dimensions for this application which included theuse of a liquid metal heat transfer fluid. A finite difference computercode was developed and used to evaluate three methods of enhancing heattransfer in the PCM energy storage system. None of these three methods,inserting thin fins, reticulated nickel, or liquid lithium, significantlyimproved the system performance. The use of a 95% void fraction reticulatednickel insert was found to increase the storage capacity (total energystored) of the system slightly with only a small decrease in the systemenergy density (energy storage/system mass). The addition of 10% liquidlithium was found to cause minor increases in both storage density andstorage capacity with the added benefit of reducing the hydrogen pressureof the lithium hydride.</TEXT></DOC>
