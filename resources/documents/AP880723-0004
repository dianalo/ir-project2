The three days of revival meetings were not supported by thenational or local offices of the Assemblies of God, Swaggart'sformer denomination. But crowds lined up at the door and sales ofSwaggart's albums and tapes were brisk.   ``I'm forgiving to him. He's not exempt from sin ortemptation,'' said Etta Mae Martin, 57, of Kansas City, Mo., whoarrived with her husband two hours before the arena doors opened tograb front-row seats.   She said Swaggart should put his troubles behind him and get onwith his life.   ``I wanted to show that men make mistakes, and he's forgiven,''said Charles Randle, 24, of Indianapolis. ``Since he told thetruth, everyone wants to get on him.''   In February, Swaggart tearfully confessed on television that hehad committed an unspecified sin against God and his family. Theconfession was followed by allegations that he had hired aprostitute to perform lewd acts while he watched.   Assemblies of God pastors were told ``not to be supportive orcooperative with Jimmy Swaggart Ministries any longer,'' said theRev. Charles Shank, district superintendent of the nation's largestPentecostal denomination. ``He has been disciplined by the churchand isn't part of our fellowship.''   Nevertheless, organizers planned for at least 8,000 followers,including Assemblies of God members, to attend the crusade eachnight.   As the band struck up an upbeat religious song, Swaggart and hiswife, Frances, kneeled to greet the outstretched hands of membersof the audience who walked up to the stage.   ``I thank you for your kindness and your love,'' Swaggart said.``I thank you for literally opposing every force of darkness andsaying, `We love you.'''   ``It's such a thrill to be here. We love you more than we canexpress,'' Frances Swaggart told the crowd.   Swaggart, singing and playing the piano, appeared in good humoras he kidded his wife about her fervent address to the audience.   ``She's always complaining about those women creatures throwingtheir hands up. I'm going to show her that on television in a fewweeks, and we'll see.'' The crusade is being videotaped for therelatively few television stations that have not canceledSwaggart's program.   Swaggart didn't refer directly to his troubles Friday night, buthe urged the audience to write checks or give cash totaling $100 ormore to save his television ministry.   ``We desperately, desperately need that help,'' he said. ``I donot ask it for me, I ask it for souls.''   Outside the 17,000-seat downtown Market Square Arena, a handfulof protesters carried signs reading, ``Ban the Bible'' and ``BanChristianity.''   Swaggart said he viewed the crusade in Indianapolis as a freshstart.   ``I've changed an awful lot,'' he said after a dress rehearsal.``I'm more keenly aware of the hurt and pain of other people. I'mmore aware of their weaknesses and despair.''   Swaggart returned to the pulpit May 22, but was defrocked by theAssemblies of God for refusing to abstain from preaching for a yearwhile undergoing professional counseling. Swaggart, 52, said hismultimillion-dollar global ministry could not survive such anabsence.   Jozette Ausbury, a spokeswoman for the Assemblies of God in itsSpringfield, Mo., headquarters said members could not be punishedfor attending the crusade.   ``They can go if they want to. That's fine,'' she said.   The church had not decided whether ministers who attend thecrusade could be punished. The church has not ruled what sanctionsit would apply to local ministers who might help the crusade, butit has given ministers at Jimmy Swaggart Ministries until Oct. 1 toleave or be defrocked.   No local Assemblies of God ministers are known to be assistingthe crusade.   Baldock, who heads the Compassion Center, Mission on Wheels andArk of the New Covenant Church, recruited about 300 volunteers toserve as ushers, security guards and support staff.   ``I preach just like most of my brothers preach _ forgiveness,love and mercy, restoration,'' Baldock said. ``That's not only withReverend Swaggart. That's with anyone accepting the message ofJesus Christ that has a problem. And because I'm forgiven.   ``The scriptures teach us that if we expect to be forgiven wemust forgive ourselves.''</TEXT></DOC>
