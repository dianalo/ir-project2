The comment period was extended through August19, 1987, to allow time for additional comment. (52 FR 27417) During thecomment period, the Department of Labor received comments from five interestedparties, including one consultant, two government agencies and two insurancecarriers.The preamble to proposed regulations contained a discussion of the definitionof war-risk hazard as it applies to victims of terrorist activities. Thematter of terrorist attacks raises complicated issues in determining coverageunder the WHA since it is not always possible to identify the person orgroup responsible for a terrorist act, or to determine the intended targetof the action. Consistent with the general tenor of the Act, it is theDepartment's view that reference to actions by a hostile force or personas war-risk hazards includes coverage of at least some victims of terroristacts. Several examples were set forth and the public was invited to submitcomments. Two insurance carriers and a government agency commented on these examplesand generally believed the analysis used in the examples was consistentwith the purpose of the Act and clarified the Department's position onthis issue. No change in the regulations on the definition of what constitutesa war risk hazard is therefore necessary. The Department's analysis of the comments received are set forth belowby sections on which comment was received. Unless otherwise indicated,section references refer to the sections of the regulations as revised.In addition, the Federal agency referred to was the same commentor, unlessotherwise indicated. Section 61.1 A Federal agency pointed out that its personal service contractors arecovered as ``employees'' under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act(FECA) (5 U.S.C. 8101(1)(B)) and questioned whether the WHA would applyto these individuals. In this situation, the WHA would not apply to personalservice contractors afforded coverage under the FECA. <T3>See WHA section 105(a). </T3>The Federal agency referred to andSection; 61.1(b)(4) and noted that its``host country contracts'' are entered into under the Mutual Security Actof 1954 (MSA). The agency further noted that andSection;61.1(b)(4) providescoverage for persons under a contract ``approved and financed'' (emphasisadded by commentor) under the MSA, but that agency regulations requireno approval for contracts under $100,000 though financed by the agency.It was requested that employees under these non-approved, small value contractsbe covered under the WHA. We believe that since the agency's regulationsrequire no approval for contracts under $100,000, such contracts are technically``approved'' for WHA coverage purposes since they are authorized by regulation.A consultant involved in marine historical research and analysis requestedthat a andSection; 61.1(b)(6) be added to the regulations and proposed specificlanguage which would provide WHA coverage for American seamen and mastersengaged for service on a United States flagship outside the continentalUnited States by an America employer and in that position because of adeclared policy of the United States government. The commentor specificallyhad in mind, in his proposed language, coverage for U.S. masters on boardre-flagged tankers in the Persian Gulf. In the alternative, this commentorproposed language which would provide temporary WHA coverage, under ExecutiveOrder, for personal service employees engaged outside of the United Statesby American employers when their activities are deemed in the nationalinterest. We believe the proposed andSection; 61.1(b)(6), as presented bythis commentor, is contrary to the intent of the WHA for lack of a contractualrelationship between the United States and the employers of the employeesfor which coverage is proposed. The Federal agency noted that andSection; 61.1(c) was misprinted as andSection;61.1(b) in the proposed regulations. The regulation is revised accordingly.Under andSection; 61.1(c)(1) the agency also requested insertion of the adjective``reasonable'' before inference. We believe the suggestion valid and revisethe regulation accordingly. The Federal agency posed the question, whether employees would/should beprovided detention benefits under andSection; 61.1(c)(3) in the followingtwo situations. First, if an employee does not complete his/her assignment(except for reasons beyond his/her control), the agency does not reimbursethe costs of returning to the United States. Second, a contractor is bankruptand does not live up to its commitment to pay for return travel costs ofits employees. We believe that application of this section should not turn on the reasonwhy the employee is not furnished transportation to his/her home or placeof employment, but should focus on whether the employee has been detainedin an area which subjects him/her to war risk hazards. <T3>Section 61.3 </T3>Under andSection; 61.3(a) the Federal agency suggested that we strike thelanguage ``who are required to'' as extraneous. We agree and the regulationis revised accordingly. Section 61.4 In the definition section, 61.4, the Federal agency requested that we insert``contractor'' before ``subcontractor'' in andSection; 61.4(c). We believethe addition of contractor clarifies the definition and we revise the regulationaccordingly. With regard to andSection; 61.4(f), the Federal agency sought an opinionon coverage for [1] injuries incurred from torture or while attemptingto escape from the control of hostile forces or persons and for [2] injuriesincurred as a result of terrorist activities of an American working fora hostile force or person. If the injuries were inflicted by a ``hostileforce or person'' as defined in andSection; 61.4(f), the nature of the injuryor nationality of the terrorist, would not be relevant. The Federal agency also requested guidance on whether, under andSection;61.4(k), a death caused by a covered injury or by complications of a coveredinjury be covered. We believe the definition in andSection; 61.4(k) coverssuch deaths. <T3>Section 61.102 </T3>The agency requested guidance on methods of calculation under andSection;61.102(d). For both the 60 day period for carriers within the United Statesand 6 month period for foreign carriers, the period within which a carriermay file objections runs from the date the decision was issued to the dateof postmark on the letter of objection. <T3>Section 61.104 </T3>With respect to reimbursement of claims expense, the Federal agency askedwhether translator fees, telex charges, international telephone and travelexpenses are reimbursable. As stated in the regulations, such expensesare reimbursable if reasonably incurred. <T3>Section 61.200 </T3>The Federal agency asked who will determine whether someone is entitledto foreign benefits under andSection; 61.200(c)(4) and whether a ``colorableclaim'' or ``final judgment for benefits'' from a foreign country shouldbe required. As in all matters of administration of the WHA, the Officeof Workers' Compensation Programs, U.S. Department of Labor, shall determineentitlement to foreign benefits based on a ``final judgment'' obtainedin a foreign country. <T3>Section 61.203 </T3>Commenting on andSection; 61.203(c), the Federal agency recommended thatthe Department use the ``present value computed at the prevailing discountrate,'' in its discharge of liability for all future payments of compensationto a noncitizen/nonresident. However, the Department is bound by the formulaset forth in the Act at section 101(c). <T3>Section 61.205 </T3>The Federal agency requested that the language ``by law, or permitted bywill'' be added after ``obligated'' in andSection; 61.205(a)(2). The Departmentbelieves that addition of the proposed language would make this sectionunnecessarily restrictive. Under andSection;andSection; 61.205(b) and 61.300(a), a Federal agency askedwhether ``home'' is inclusive of ``domicile'' and ``residence.'' Accordingto<T3> Black's Law Dictionary,</T3> ``home'' is not synonymous with ``residence''since a person may have more than one residence but only one ``home'' or``domicile.'' <T3>Section 61.300 </T3>The Federal agency asked how funds under andSection; 61.300(b), which aredisbursed during the detained employee's absence to his dependents, areaccounted for and whether an employee would have a claim against the governmentfor any universe disbursement. We believe that government may use its discretionin its disbursement of compensation to an employee's dependents and wouldnot be subject to claims by the employee for the exercise of that discretion.The Federal agency requested that under andSection; 61.300(d)(5) the word``is'' be changed to ``has been.'' The regulations have been revised accordingly.Section 61.301The Federal agency asked who has the burden of proof in proving entitlementunder andSection; 61.301(a)_the dependent or the government. As in all claimsproceedings under WHA the burden of proof is on the claimant, or in thiscase the dependent.Section 61.305A Federal agency asked whether there would be a penalty, under andSection;61.305, where a dependent fails to give notice of the change of statusof the formerly detained employee. In addition to the penalties imposedby section 203 of the Act, the statute does provide a method for reducinga dependent's entitlement to continuing compensation, as well as proceduresfor recovering any overpayment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification_Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The Department of Labor does not believe that this final rule constitutesa ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291, because it is not likelyto result in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) a major increase in cost or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investmentproductivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Accordingly, no regulatory analysis is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The information collection requirements entailed by this final rule willnot differ from those currently in effect. No new forms are required. Allforms that are referenced have been submitted for approval by the Officeof Management and Budget where required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Department believes that the rule will have no ``significant economicimpact upon a substantial number of small entities'' within the meaningof section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. No. 96-354,91 Stat. 1164 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)). The Secretary has certified to the ChiefCounsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration to this effect.This conclusion is reached because the proposed revisions do not imposeany additional requirements upon small entities, but only implement the1958, 1959 and 1961 amendments to the War Hazards Act. Accordingly, noregulatory impact analysis is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>20 CFR Part 61War claims, Workers' compensation, Claims, Labor, Detention benefits, Indemnitypayments.20 CFR Part 62Claims, Government contracts, Health care, Workers' compensation.Accordingly, Parts 61 and 62, Subchapter F, Chapter I of Title 20, Codeof Federal Regulations, are amended as set forth below.1. 20 CFR Part 61 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 61_CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION UNDER THE WAR HAZARDS COMPENSATIONACT, AS AMENDED</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General Provisions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.1 Statutory provisions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.2 Administration of the Act and this chapter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.3 Purpose and scope of this part.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.4 Definitions and use of terms.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Reimbursement of Carriers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.100 General reimbursement provisions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.101 Filing a request for reimbursement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.102 Disposition of reimbursement requests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.103 Examination of records of carriers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.104 Reimbursement of claims expense.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.105 Direct payment of benefits.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Compensation for Injury, Disability, or Death</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.200 Entitlement to benefits.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.201 Filing of notice and claim.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.202 Time limitations for filing notice and claim.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.203 Limitations on and deductions from benefits.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.204 Furnishing of medical treatment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.205 Burial expense. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.206 Reports by employees and dependents.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Detention Benefits</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.300 Payment of detention benefits.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.301 Filing a claim for detention benefits.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.302 Time limitations for filing a claim for detention benefits.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.303 Determination of detention status.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.304 Limitations on and deductions from detention benefits.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.305 Responsibilities of dependents receiving detention benefits.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.306 Transportation of persons released from detention and returnof employees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.307 Transportation of recovered bodies of missing persons.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart E_Miscellaneous Provisions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.400 Custody of records relating to claims under the War HazardsCompensation Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.401 Confidentiality of records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.402 Protection, release, inspection and copying of records. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.403 Approval of claims for legal and other services. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">61.404 Assignments; creditors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 1950 Reorg.
