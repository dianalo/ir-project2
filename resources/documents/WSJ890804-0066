In May, Great Western Financial Corp., of Beverly Hills, Calif., filed suit in Los Angeles federal court following the Bank Board's rejection of an application of its Great Western Bank unit to convert to a federal savings bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. A third giant thrift, Home Federal Savings, a unit of San Diego-based HomeFed Corp., was given permission by the bank board on Tuesday to leave FSLIC.    But the attempts of these three Sandamp;Ls to leave FSLIC may all be moot. Under pending congressional legislation, no thrifts would be allowed to leave FSLIC for a period of five years.    Home Savings, a unit of H.F. Ahmanson andamp; Co., of Los Angeles, is the nation's largest thrift, with assets of $43 billion. In its suit, also filed in Los Angeles federal district court, the Sandamp;L said the Bank Board has yet to act on its application to leave the FSLIC by merging into its much-smaller Bowery Savings Bank subsidiary, whose deposits are already FDIC-insured. The suit asks the court to order the Bank Board to act favorably on the application, or to rule that Bank Board approval is &quot;not required.&quot;    Great Western also planned to gain savings-bank status by merging with Great Western Bank of Bellevue, Wash., a much smaller unit. The Bank Board, in a ruling that surprised no one, said Great Western hadn't applied for the move in time to exempt itself from 1987 legislation that blocked thrifts from moving to the bank fund for two years. The agency ruled Home Federal Savings had applied in time.    Attempts by Sandamp;Ls to jump to the FDIC are controversial among regulators because they could undermine efforts to replenish the insolvent thrift fund, whose premiums are much higher than FDIC premiums. Congress is siding with the regulators by incorporating a five-year ban on defections from the FSLIC in a pending bill to finance the closing of many insolvent Sandamp;Ls. Although the bill is being held up in a dispute over its financing provisions, the ban on exiting the FSLIC is expected to remain in the bill, and become law when signed by President Bush. </TEXT></DOC>
