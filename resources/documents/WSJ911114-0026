The average seven-day compound taxable yield slid to 4.92%from 5.05%, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report.The average 30-day compound yield eased to 5.06% from 5.11%.Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends.</LP><TEXT>   The average seven-day simple yield eased to 4.81% from4.93% and the average 30-day simple yield eased to 4.94% from4.99%.   Despite the declining yields, assets in money funds rose,the Holliston, Mass., newsletter said. Assets of the 517taxable funds increased $458.3 million in the week endedTuesday, to $464.1 billion.   Meanwhile, the average maturity of the investments held bythe funds remained at 63 days for the fifth week in a row.The funds invest in commercial paper (short-term corporateIOUs), short-term bank certificates of deposit and Treasurybills.   Martha Wittbrodt, editor of Donoghue's Money Fund Report,attributes the decline in money fund yields to last week'slowering of the discount rate -- what the Federal Reservecharges banks for loans -- from 5% to 4.5%. &quot;It's having abig impact on yields,&quot; she says.   The Federal Reserve also lowered the Federal Funds rate --what banks charge each other for loans -- to 4.75% from 5%.&quot;We haven't seen the end of the decline yet,&quot; she says.   Meanwhile, assets of 290 tax-free funds increased by $1.2billion to $91.1 billion.   The average seven-day compound yield of tax-free fundseased to 3.82% from 3.98%. The latest yield is equivalent to5.31% on a taxable investment for someone in the 28% taxbracket and to 5.54% for those paying 31% in taxes.   The average maturity of the tax-free funds' investmentsincreased one day to 59 days.   The long average maturity of the funds helps explain whyassets in the tax-free funds increased even though yieldsdeclined. Institutions poured $1.3 billion into the funds tolock in the yields. &quot;They expect rates to decline,&quot; says Ms.Wittbrodt, &quot;and this lets them hold onto the yield a littlelonger.&quot;   Individual investors, meanwhile, pulled $824.7 millionfrom tax-free funds, to search for higher-yieldingalternatives, such as bond funds.</TEXT></DOC>
