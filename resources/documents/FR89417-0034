It alsoclarified situations causing diversions, defined other assets acquiredby license fees, and identified sources of license revenues affected bythe proposed rule. This action requires States to use interest earned onhunting and fishing license revenues for fish and wildlife resource managementas a condition to remain eligible to receive Federal Aid (Pittman-Robertsonor Dingell-Johnson) funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>Provisions of this rule will become effectiveon May 17, 1989 except that those States that will require legislativeaction to implement requirements relating to the disposition of interestrevenues will be allowed up to three years from this date to get such authorization.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Conley Moffett, Chief, Divisionof Federal Aid, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC 20240, telephone(703) 235-1526.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Both the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration(16 U.S.C. 669, <T3>et seq.</T3>) and Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration (16 U.S.C.777, <T3>et seq.</T3>) Acts contain provisions requiring that no money may beapportioned to a State unless that State has passed laws assenting to theprovisions of the pertinent Act and has passed laws for conservation ofwildlife and fish. Such laws must contain a prohibition against diversionof license fees paid by hunters and fishermen for any other purpose thanthe administration of the State fish and wildlife agency. This rule clarifiespreviously undefined Department of the Interior rules in accord with thegenerally-accepted principle that interest should accrue to principal fromwhich it was generated.The Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act and Federal Aid in Sport FishRestoration Act require that as a prerequisite to receiving federal funds,States must prevent diversions of license fees derived from fishermen andhunters to any purpose other than ``the administration of said State gameand fish department.'' The previous rule promulgated under authority ofthe Acts (50 CFR 80.4) stated that ``[a] diversion of license fees occurswhen a State fish and wildlife agency, through legislation or otherwise:(1) Loses control of the expenditure of any portion of its license revenues,or (2) Loses control of capital assets (or income therefrom) derived fromlicense revenues * * *.'' Because of the increased complexity of Stategovernment and the variety of responsibilities assigned to fish and wildlifeagencies, the requirements relating to control of assets and expendituresinvolve an increased number of controls at higher levels in the State.Accordingly, this new rule does not require that fish and wildlife agencieshave complete control over license funds, but, instead, that license revenuesmust be used by State fish and wildlife agencies only to manage fish andwildlife resources that they have authority by the State law to manage.The Department has determined that this rule is not a major Federal actionsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment under theNational Environmental Policy Act and, therefore, the preparation of anEnvironmental Impact Statement is not required.This rule is not a major rule under Executive Order 12291 and will nothave a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). The annual effecton the economy will be less than the threshold required for a major rule,no major increase in costs or prices will occur, and no significant effectson competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation are expected.This rule does not contain any recordkeeping or information collectionrequirements requiring Office of Management and Budget approval under thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980.This rule was published as a proposed rule on August 5, 1988 (53 CFR 29500)and comments were invited until September 19, 1988. A total of 44 commentswere received; 18 from State fish and wildlife agencies, 19 from Stateconservation organizations, 6 from National conservation organizations,and 1 from a private citizen. Of the 44 comments, 3 States expressed oppositionto the portion that related to the requirement that interest earned onlicense revenues be regarded as license revenues. No negative commentswere received from the other groups.The 3 States expressed concern that claiming money derived from interestwould jeopardize their existing appropriations from the general fund orthat they would be assessed higher costs for State overhead than they arepresently foregoing and that the rule would require the cost of additionalaccounting. We recognized that the rules could have negative impacts onseveral States but judged that significantly greater numbers of Stateswould benefit from it. Income from interest had become a significant sourceof revenue for most agencies. The Wildlife Conservation Fund of Americasurvey of 1987 shows that the number of States receiving interest fromlicense revenues has increased from 18 to 36 in the 7 year period fromthe prior survey to the last one in 1986. The total interest was about22 million dollars in 1986.Many commentors asked for clarification of the effective date. The effectivedate of this revision is 30 days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>However, it is recognized that some States mayneed to enact legislation to meet the requirements of this provision. Therefore,for those States a period not to exceed 3 years after the effective dateof the rule will be allowed in order to enact the needed legislation. Allother States will need to be in compliance, and remain in compliance, onor after the effective date. The 3 year period was generally accepted bymost commentors.Most of the State conservation organizations suggested that income derivedfrom license revenue funded law enforcement activities such as fines, penalties,and sales of confiscated equipment be defined as license revenues for purposesof this rule. This suggestion was not adopted because it was judged thatthe Secretary was not given this authority by legislation.Commentors also suggested that fees charged on recreation areas that aremanaged by the State using license revenues such as camping, boat launching,and parking be included in the term ``access fees'' in section (a)(1).The final rule had been changed to ``access and recreation fees'' to clarifythis intent.Some commentors suggested that the proceeds of leases of lands be treatedas license revenues like the sale of lands. That suggestion was incorporatedin section (a)(2).The principal author of this proposal is Thomas W. Taylor, Division ofFederal Aid, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 80</ITAG>Fish grant program, Natural Resources, Grant administration, and wildlife.Accordingly, 50 CFR 80 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 80_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
