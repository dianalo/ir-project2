But this case was different. Ms. Davis didn't have breastcancer. She was having the surgery so she wouldn't get it.</LP><TEXT>   Her decision is an example of a controversial response toa terrifying disease. &quot;Prophylactic&quot; mastectomies areuncommon -- but that any women at all get them shows just howfrightening a prospect breast cancer remains, despite gainsin detection, treatment and even prevention.   A slender, energetic woman, Ms. Davis had worried aboutbreast cancer from the time she was 14. It was then that hermother, 44, was diagnosed with it and underwent a doublemastectomy. Doctors told her and her two sisters they were atincreased risk of someday developing the disease. From thenon, she began checking her breasts regularly for lumps.   In a self-examination about seven years ago, Ms. Davisfelt what she'd always dreaded. It was a tiny lump, so minuteher physician at first couldn't feel it. Doctors disagreed onwhat to do. Some said just watch it carefully. But Ms. Davisdidn't want to take chances. She had it removed. It wasprecancerous.   Then, a year ago, doctors found a malignant breast tumorin Ms. Davis's fraternal twin. The twin had a doublemastectomy, removing the healthy breast along with thecancerous one. That made two of Ms. Davis's primary relativeswho had had breast cancer before menopause. For Ms. Davis,the frightening one-in-nine odds U.S. women face of gettingbreast cancer suddenly rose to one in two, some doctors said.   &quot;I was totally freaked out,&quot; she says. &quot;Totally freakedout.&quot;   After consulting with doctors, Ms. Davis decided to fightthe specter of breast cancer through the most radical measureof all -- she decided to have her breasts removed. Livingwith high odds, she decided, was worse than losing part ofher body.   &quot;I felt a tremendous sense of relief,&quot; Ms. Davis says,recalling her first moments of consciousness and physicalpain after the long operation.   Her story underscores the fear and hopelessness that stillsurround breast cancer, even as patients' odds improvethrough earlier detection, higher cure rates and a potentialpreventive drug. But other factors stir up gloom.   Inexplicably, breast cancer is on the rise. Casesdiagnosed annually rose 26% between 1982 and 1988 in theU.S., according to the National Cancer Institute. Advances indetection may account for some of the increase. Still, thisyear more than 44,000 Americans will die of breast cancer.   As scientists identify genetic factors in the cancer, morewomen are becoming convinced they are ticking time bombs.   Sandi Reese, who was 12 when her mother was diagnosed withbreast cancer and 22 when it took her mother's life, saysthat from early adolescence &quot;my mother never went out of mymind. My breasts never went out of my mind. . . . I decided Iwas going to die when I was 45. I never planned past 45.&quot; In1990, Ms. Reese had a preventive double mastectomy. &quot;Now Iplan for the future. . . . It's changed my entire life.&quot;   In the medical profession, prophylactic mastectomies arehighly controversial. &quot;I think the idea of removing a bodypart preventively is really crazy,&quot; says Susan Love, asurgeon who is head of the Faulkner Breast Center in Boston.   Figures on how many such operations are done are elusivebecause no major medical organizations track them. Doctorssay the number is small.   Of the roughly 800 patients undergoing mastectomiesannually at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering hospital, amajor cancer center, about 20 have prophylactic mastectomies,says Jeanne Petrek, a surgeon there. At Boston's Brigham andWomen's Hospital, only two or three of the 450 mastectomiesdone each year are for women without cancer, says TimothyEberlein, chief of surgical oncology, who discourages theprocedure. The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., doesprophylactic mastectomies, but doesn't track them apart fromother mastectomies.   So it also isn't clear whether the number of women takingthis radical course is rising or falling. Some doctors see adrop, while others say a growing number of women are askingabout the operation. Some say mounting evidence of ahereditary link to breast cancer may lead more women toconsider the option.   Most physicians say they recommend mastectomies forhealthy women reluctantly, usually only for patients with atleast two primary relatives who had breast cancer. &quot;It'snever recommended unless you have a really profound situationon your hands,&quot; says Dennis Slamon, head of clinical researchat the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center at UCLA's medicalschool.   Others won't do it. &quot;What we need to do is find outexactly what causes breast cancer and what the initiatingsteps are so we can then eliminate them in a much more subtleway,&quot; says Dr. Love at the Faulkner Breast Center.   Adding to the controversy is the fact that prophylacticmastectomies won't guarantee against getting breast cancer,since doctors can never remove all the breast tissue.&quot;Reducing the breast tissue by 90% does not mean your risk isnecessarily reduced by 90%,&quot; says Dr. Love. There's also thesmall risk that a healthy woman having the operation may dieof complications from the surgery itself.   Some doctors who argue against the operation point toadvances in detection -- low-radiation mammograms that canspot a lump two years before it can be felt. Cure rates arerising, too. Between 1981 and 1987, 77% of breast cancerpatients survived at least five years after diagnosis, saysthe National Center for Health Statistics. That's up from74.4% in 1977 to 1980.   Most encouraging of all is a relatively new drug,tamoxifen, that has proved effective in preventing cancer inthe unaffected breast of women who have cancer in one breast.Researchers believe it may ward off breast cancer altogether,and a large-scale trial is being prepared to find out, usinghealthy women with a family history of the disease.   Nevertheless, preventive mastectomies continue. Doctorssay some women literally beg for one. &quot;I certainly have seenwomen who are so terrified at the prospect of getting breastcancer that they have opted for the procedure when their riskwas relatively low,&quot; says Marc Lippman, director of theLombardi Cancer Center at Georgetown University Hospital.   Kelman Cohen, a Richmond, Va., plastic surgeon who didreconstructive surgery on Ms. Reese, says he has dissuaded60% of those who have consulted him about the operation fromhaving it done. He sent Ms. Reese away for a year to thinkabout it. He blames doctors for some of the eagerness.   &quot;The plastic surgeon sees the patient who has aninsatiable desire for this operation,&quot; Dr. Cohen says. &quot;Shegoes to the general surgeon anytime she sees an irregularityin her breast. The general surgeon, who's done a biopsy sixor seven times, says, `Do a mastectomy. . . . Get her off myback.'&quot;   Doctors say they try to act in the best interests of theirpatients. &quot;There are women who have had four to six biopsies,and the process has driven them beyond the pale,&quot; says Dr.Lippman, an oncologist, who Ms. Davis consulted. &quot;They'reterrified . . . their quality of life has been affected.&quot; Headds, &quot;If I thought someone was being overly responsive tofears . . . I would try to put their risk in perspective.&quot;   In financial terms, the choice is costly. Doctor andhospital fees, including for reconstructive surgery, cantotal $20,000. While Ms. Davis's insurance company coveredher bills, most insurers are reluctant to do so for healthywomen.   For Ms. Davis, it was her sister's diagnosis thatpersuaded her to take action. &quot;It conjured up images of mymother who suffered so much her last few years,&quot; she says inher native Alabama accent. &quot;And the thought of that possiblyhappening to my sister and then the thought that it couldpossibly happen to me or my other sister. It just became morereal.&quot;   Her husband, Tim Davis, was anxious. &quot;I began to getworried that there was something going on in that family,&quot; herecalls. Secretly, on the recommendation of a friend, he madea call to Dr. Slamon of UCLA. He wanted to know what more hiswife could do to be extra vigilant. Mammograms twice a yearinstead of once a year, he wondered? He never expected whatDr. Slamon suggested.   &quot;He almost immediately -- though he made the appropriatedisclaimers -- suggested we ought to consider a prophylacticmastectomy,&quot; Mr. Davis says.   Mr. Davis was stunned. &quot;I'd never heard of anything likethat,&quot; he says.   But he didn't dismiss the idea. He consulted otherdoctors. Most said it was an appropriate measure to consider.But when he called his old family physician in Tulsa, Okla.,the doctor said he was crazy. Later that doctor called back,saying he'd talked to some colleagues and that it wasn't suchan outrageous idea after all.   As he made phone call after phone call, one killerstatistic kept running through Mr. Davis's mind. &quot;Everyonewas talking 50/50, a one-in-two chance,&quot; he recalls. &quot;Thoseare about the worst odds I can imagine.&quot;   But how could he suggest a preventive mastectomy to hiswife -- the very procedure that makes getting the disease sohorrifying to many women? &quot;I was scared to raise it,&quot; hesays. &quot;I knew that Tricia was a pretty strong person, butwe're dealing with emotions here I'd never had to confrontbefore.&quot;   Ms. Davis recalls how one evening last December herhusband sat her down and recounted what the doctors had beensuggesting. She didn't say much. Mr. Davis says she was&quot;shocked.&quot; She says, &quot;I guess I was astonished only in thathe appeared to go through all that trouble. I don't know -- Iwas just really touched more than anything. I was reallytouched.&quot;   But Ms. Davis was interested from the beginning. Sherecalls feeling, &quot;I almost think it would be a blessing tohave this surgery done.&quot; Though an attractive woman, she saysshe never fretted much over her appearance, and vanity wasn'ta factor in her decision.   She reflected for a few more months, then went to see Dr.Lippman at Georgetown. She says he didn't try to persuade herone way or the other, just laid out her options. Afterconsulting other doctors, including a plastic surgeon, shedecided to go ahead.   She told her father. &quot;I was totally shocked, nearly out ofmy mind,&quot; he recalls. But after talking to his longtimefamily physician and other family members, he &quot;called her upand said I realize it's your and Tim's decision, but I wantyou to know that I think you're right.&quot;   Today Tricia Davis is cheerfully back at work high up in asuburban Washington office building. She's convinced shesaved her life.   Her twin is doing well too. But their older sister iswrestling with the same dilemma Tricia did. She can't decide.</TEXT></DOC>
