<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-46-0728 </DOCNO><TEXT>A computer code ORION-II has been developed to estimate environmentalconcentration and dose due to airborne release of radioactive materialfrom multiple sources of nuclear fuel cycle facilities. The modifiedGaussian plume model is applied to calculate atmospheric dispersion.The plume depletion models such as gravitational settling, dry deposition,precipitation scavenging and radioactive decay are considered as thecauses of the depletion and deposition on the ground and vegetation.Dose to the public is calculated as an individual dose. Inhalation andoral intake are considered as internal pathways. Submersion in the radioactivecloud and external exposure to ground surface contamination are consideredas external pathways. ORION-II is the updated version of ORION code (PNCTN841-83-42) and is appricable to the case study of environmental assessmentfor the nuclear fuel cycle facilities. ORION-II is written in FORTRAN-IVlanguage and can be run on IBM 360, 370, 303X, 308X, 43XX and FACOM M-seriescomputers.</TEXT></DOC>
