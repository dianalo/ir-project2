While the stated purpose of thelegislation is to reduce discrimination in employmentdecisions, and thus increase the representation of minoritiesin the work force, it has the effect of prohibiting a veryuseful mechanism for accomplishing just that.   Employers are concerned about two aspects of theiremployment process. They want to select employees who havethe highest probability of success in their firms. They alsowant to avoid discrimination suits. Unfortunately, these canbe conflicting concerns. The employer who wants to maximizeboth outcomes has few choices, and the Civil Rights Acteliminates one of the best alternatives.</LP><TEXT>   Adverse impact is the less obvious type of discrimination,and the fear of adverse-impact lawsuits causes much anxietyamong employers. Such discrimination occurs when an identicalstandard is equally applied to all applicants or employees,but one group is more negatively affected than another. Forexample, if a height standard is equally applied to allapplicants, Hispanics and Asians are more negatively affectedthan whites, and women more than men.   The Civil Rights Act is meant to set aside five SupremeCourt decisions from 1989 that made it easier for employersto prevail in employment discrimination cases. One, WardsCove v. Atonio, had significantly lightened the burden on theemployer in an adverse impact case.   The Civil Rights Act returns to the pre-1989 situation byrequiring that the employer prove that an employment standardthat results in adverse impact is necessary for successfuljob performance. Guidelines issued by the Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission, and approved by the Supreme Court,spell out very specific technical requirements for evaluatingwhether such a standard is job related. Various commentatorshave argued that these requirements are burdensome,particularly for small employers who do not possess the legalor psychological expertise necessary to understand orinvestigate these issues.   This leaves an organization with two choices if it wishesto protect itself from adverse impact lawsuits. Either it canrely on its ability to demonstrate the job relatedness of itsselection standards to the court's satisfaction, a somewhatrisky proposition, or it can ensure that adverse impact doesnot occur in the first place.   Because adverse impact is avoided by hiring the &quot;correct&quot;percentage of applicants based on race and sex, conservativecritics of the Civil Rights Act labeled it a &quot;quota bill.&quot; Torelieve this concern, the legislation was amended tospecifically prohibit the use of quotas in employmentdecisions. But quotas are actually needed if we want to reachthe best compromise between hiring the most qualifiedemployees for a particular job and eliminating adverseimpact.   A widely held maxim among organizational scholars is thatemployee productivity is caused primarily by two factors,ability and motivation. Of the two, ability is much easier touse as a predictor of job performance. Motivation isnotoriously difficult to define and measure, while thedefinition and measurement of ability are widely understoodand accepted. Further, as the economy has become more andmore dependent on the mental (as opposed to physical) skillsof the work force, the importance of cognitive ability as apredictor of performance has been enhanced.   In fact, numerous studies have demonstrated thatstandardized tests of cognitive ability -- such as theGeneral Aptitude Test Battery (GATB) -- are the bestindicators of future job performance, substantially betterthan interviews, reference checks, or education andexperience standards. However, widespread use of such testsby employers is hindered by the fact that minorities, blacksespecially, achieve poorer scores on average than whites.Thus, use of cognitive-ability tests always results inadverse impact, a fact which is well illustrated by theeffect of the National Collegiate Athletic Association'sProposition 48 on black athletes.   The employer is thus placed in a difficult position. Thebest (and least expensive) predictor of employee performanceis guaranteed to result in adverse impact, leading to thehigh probability of facing a court challenge. The employercan either follow the risky course of attempting to convincethe court that the test is job related (numerous pastdecisions have viewed cognitive ability tests with disfavor),or it can alter its use of the test so that adverse impactdoes not occur. There are three possible alternativestrategies for eliminating adverse impact.   First, the employer can abandon cognitive ability testingaltogether. This is the strategy adopted by the LaborDepartment when it recently suspended the use of the GATB,and of the state of California, which, by court decree since1974, prevents the use of intelligence tests for blacks inschools for any purpose, even if expressly requested by thechild's parent.   Second, the employer can set a relatively low cut-offscore on the test. All employees who score above that pointare considered equivalent in terms of their cognitiveability, and are selected by some other strategy, typicallyan interview or some other subjective assessment. Thispractice is widely used in civil service selection, whereapplicants have to &quot;pass&quot; a test, and then move on to someother part of the selection process.   Third, the employer can use a combination of quotas andtest results. Specifically, the employer can decide to selecta certain percentage of applicants from various groups, andthen select the highest performers from each group. The LaborDepartment engaged in this practice, under the label ofwithin-group norming, with the GATB prior to suspending itsuse.   Which of the three alternatives is best for theorganization, where &quot;best&quot; is defined as maximizing workforce productivity while meeting the social goal ofeliminating adverse impact? John and Rhonda Hunterinvestigated this question and published their results in thehighly respected Psychological Bulletin in 1984.   Compared to selecting purely on the basis of ability,which results in the highest quality work force, using quotasand test scores results in a 5% decrease in quality, whileusing low cut-off scores results in a dramatic 83% decreasein quality. Using one year of hiring in the federalgovernment as an example, they calculated that using thequota method would result in a loss of $780 million in lostproductivity, whereas $13.11 billion would be lost using thelow cut-off strategy. The use of quotas and test scores inconjunction causes the smallest productivity decrease whileallowing for greater participation of minorities in the workforce.   However, the use of quotas is explicitly forbidden by thenew law. This &quot;shot in the foot&quot; is the result of the failureof society -- Congress and the president, included -- toopenly debate the two competing social goals of basingselection decisions purely on the basis of individual merit,and achieving a work force in which all groups are equallyrepresented.   Events of the past two days have revealed that theseissues are not openly debated even within the Bushadministration, where a leaked policy statement on the use ofpreferences in affirmative action programs was quicklyaltered overnight. For their part, civil rights leaders cutoff debate by accusing the administration of &quot;playing therace card.&quot; Thus we now have a law that explicitly forbidsthe employment strategy that is the best compromise betweenthe goals of the right and the left.   ---   Mr. Carson is a assistant professor of management atArizona State University.</TEXT></DOC>
