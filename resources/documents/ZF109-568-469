But, as far as Europe isconcerned, Kyocera reckons that a decade of supplying computers on an OEMbasis to major personal computer vendors, such as Tandy Corp, stands thecompany in good stead to launch its own range.andP;  When asked if the company'sprevious anonymity in the personal computer sphere was going to be ahinderance to getting the Multilight computers off the ground, Kyoceraadmitted it would have to work to raise its profile to succeed in such anover-crowded market.andP;  Dave Poskett, just appointed manager of the personalcomputer division of Kyocera Electronics after eight years withHewlett-Packard, said that the company's reasons for moving into the personalcomputer market were that this is a market that continues to grow despitecurrent economic conditions and Kyocera feels it can respond to the customerdemand for high performance but low cost standards-based machines.andP;  Kyocerasays the Multilight range has been designed specifically for the Europeanmarket following a research programme - carried out in conjunction withmarket research analysts Dataquest - which revealed a decline in the 8086 and80286-based marketplace as 80386SX-based machines become thought of by mostpotential business users as the most feasible point of entry into personalcomputing.andP;  The Multilight personal computer range boasts small footprint,and engineering based on a modular design.andP;  Kyocera emphasises that it nowoffers a complete complementary system - computer, laser printer, scanner andmaintenance support.andP;  The company has expanded its sales service and supportgroups at Reading and a telephone hot-line consultancy service has been setup.andP;  Kyocera is offering free one year on-site maintenance for the Multilightpersonal computers.andP;  The new range, beginning with the 386sx and the 386/25,will be available through dealers nationwide, with prices of #2,190 for the3862x with 2Mb RAM and 50Mb hard disk - #2,450 for 100Mb hard disk; and#2,950 for the 386/25 with 2Mb and 50Mb hard disk - #3,250 for 100Mb disk.andO;All come with mouse and MS-DOS 4.01.andP;  Monitor options include the MultiSyncSVGA priced at #650, and the VGA monitor for #490.andP;  Kyocera says it is aimingto ship 2,000 machines per month within the next 12 months - the company isoptimistically hoping to reach the same level of success as it has in Europewith its printers.andP;  Following Kyocera's takeover of AVX Corp last year (CI No1,274), there are plans to begin manufacturing in sites such as Rouen.andP;  -andO;Susan Norris</TEXT></DOC>
