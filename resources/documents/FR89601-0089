The AppendixB Environmental Technical Specifications currently contain no radiologicalspecifications but contain only a section, 3.5 for ANO-1 and 5.9 for ANO-2,entitled, ``Special Requirements.'' These sections discuss vegetation anderosion control of the plant site and transmission line right-of-way corridorsconstructed for the distribution of energy generated by ANO-1andamp;2. Theinformation provided in these sections was required by the NRC staff evaluationsincluded in the ANO-1 ``Environmental Report'' and in NUREG-0254, ``FinalEnvironmental Statement Related to Operation of Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit2,'' both of which discussed the potential for severe erosion along theproposed transmission corridors.The Need for The Proposed ActionThe amendments are proposed because the licensee considers Appendix B ascurrently written to be primarily descriptive in nature, discussing theenvironmental control of the right of way corridors related to the constructionof the plant. The landscaping and planting described in the land use managementsection were completed during the initial construction of Unit 1. Thereare no ``action statements'' or reporting requirements, and no items inNRC regulations are addressed. Significant surveillance has been performedin the past several years to conclude that there has been no environmentaldamage to those areas addressed in this section. In summary, these TSsare not needed to ensure protection of the environment.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionThe proposed amendments would not result in any modification of plant systems,components or procedures. Consequently, the probability of accidents hasnot been increased and the post-accident radiological releases will notbe greater than previously determined, nor do the proposed amendments otherwiseaffect radiological plant effluents. Therefore, the Commission concludesthat there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed amendments.With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed amendmentswould eliminate a listing of requirements which have already been adequatelymet. NRC surveys have been conducted which have verified that the licenseehas constructed, planted and maintained the properties identified in AppendixB in compliance wth previous commitments. The corridors, in particular,have adequate ground cover with only two slightly eroded areas, which poseno threat to either the environment or the transmission tower foundations.These surveys also revealed no indication of herbicide use. The amendmentsdo not affect non-radiological plant effluents and have no other environmentalimpact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significantnon-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendments.Alternative to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action involves no use of resources not previously considered in theFinal Environmental Statements (construction permit and operating license)for ANO-1andamp;2.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to preparean environmental impact statement for the proposed amendment.For further details with respect to this action, see the applications foramendments dated March 20 and 25, 1985 which are available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the Tomlinson Library, Arkansas Tech University, Russellville,Arkansas 72801.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 25th day of May, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For The Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">George Dick, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Director, Project Directorate_IV, Division of Reactor Projects_III,IV, and V and Special Projects, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-12994 Filed 5-31-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 7590-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
