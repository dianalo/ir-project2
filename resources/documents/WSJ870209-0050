In an unusual move, the exchange said it would sharply reduce the limit on individual traders' holdings in pork belly contracts for delivery this month, effective when the market closes Wednesday.    Pork belly supplies available for delivery are unusually low; futures contracts still outstanding on the Merc as of late last week called for delivery of roughly eight times available supplies.    Exchange officials denied that their action had anything to do with fear of a squeeze, but said the emergency steps were needed to avoid &quot;market distortions.&quot;    Analysts said no one was deliberately trying to squeeze the market -- typically, a dramatic trading maneuver in which big buyers of futures try in times of shortage to force sellers to pay higher and higher prices to offset their &quot;short&quot; positions, or delivery obligations.    Rather, dealers and processors of pork bellies, or slabs of uncured bacon, have been buying futures contracts to meet their needs amid a general scarcity of frozen supplies, analysts said. The result has been steady gains in prices for February delivery. The contract rose one cent a pound Friday to 68.25 cents, more than two cents a pound higher than March prices.    Contracts calling for delivery of about 34 million pounds of frozen pork bellies this month were outstanding on the Merc as of last Thursday, the most recent data available. Only about 4.1 million pounds have been certified by the exchange for delivery against its futures contracts.    As of this Wednesday, the Merc said the limit on traders' holdings in February pork bellies would be reduced to 50 contracts from 150 contracts currently. Each contract covers delivery of 40,000 pounds of frozen pork bellies. The forced liquidation is likely to depress prices this week.    As of this Friday's close, the limit will be reduced again to 25 contracts. Trading in the contract ends Feb. 20, although deliveries against it continue through Feb. 27.    This is the first time in several years that the Merc has reduced trading limits in pork bellies. Some analysts, who asked that their names not be used, said the Merc overreacted, and that emergency action wasn't yet necessary.    But Merc officials said the steps were needed. &quot;We don't want to see any market distortions, and we're not accusing anyone of trying to distort the market,&quot; said Laurence Rosenberg, chairman of the exchange's business conduct committee. But &quot;with the current situation, we feel we have to reduce positions.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
