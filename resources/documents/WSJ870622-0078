But at 33, Mr. Pittman is tackling his challenge a couple of decades earlier than most executives. Last August, he left his post as chief executive officer of MTV Networks Inc., the Viacom International Inc. subsidiary. He is widely credited with helping to revolutionize the music industry with his role in creating the 24-hour music-video cable network in 1981.    With Los Angeles entertainment giant MCA Inc. as a backer and 50% owner, Mr. Pittman formed Quantum Media Inc. to pursue media and entertainment-related ventures and acquisitions. One of his most recent interests is JWT Group Inc., the advertising concern that is the object of a takeover proposal from Britain's WPP Group PLC.    According to Mr. Pittman, Quantum currently holds a 4.7% stake in JWT, which is said to be considering alternatives to the WPP bid, including the possibility of a friendly merger with MCA. Mr. Pittman won't elaborate on the JWT holdings, but sources involved in the discussions say MCA called on their young partner to help pursue talks with the advertising giant.    Mr. Pittman's resume reads like a quintessential whiz kid's: He started as a disk jockey at 15 and later dropped out of college to pursue a career in radio. At 21, he was the highest-paid radio programmer in the country; at 23, he was the program director for National Broadcasting Co.'s AM radio station in New York City and helped make it the top-ranked station in the country. At 28, Mr. Pittman was a vice president at cable giant Warner-Amex, a joint venture of Warner Communications Inc. and American Express Co.    At Warner-Amex -- now named Warner Cable and wholly owned by Warner -- Mr. Pittman was responsible for programming at MTV, which quickly became one of the industry's fastest-growing cable networks. Mr. Pittman was involved in every facet of the programming and format at MTV. Warner eventually sold a one-third interest to the public.    In August 1985, Mr. Pittman tried to take MTV private with other company executives in a leveraged buyout financed by Forstmann Little andamp; Co. Although he came close to succeeding, Warner ended up selling MTV to Viacom, which also bought the public's one-third interest. Mr. Pittman, however, got a good consolation prize: about $2.3 million through the sale of options granted to him before Viacom bought MTV.    But Mr. Pittman was disenchanted, and eager to listen when the head of MCA Records, Irving Azoff, suggested over dinner one night that he leave MTV to form a venture with MCA. After more formal talks with MCA President Sidney J. Sheinberg, a deal was struck. Although Viacom was reluctant to release Mr. Pittman from an employment contract, the company agreed on the condition that it have some involvement in Mr. Pittman's new record label.    Mr. Pittman acknowledges that his MTV job will be &quot;a tough act to follow,&quot; and he jokes that his new company, Quantum, &quot;has lots of overhead but no revenue.&quot; His aim, he says, is to &quot;serve the entertainment needs of a common consumer group -- the visually oriented, under-40 generation&quot; -- by developing projects in motion pictures, records, television, marketing and promotion.    Because his primary experience is in music, Mr. Pittman's focus so far has been in that arena. The new QMI Music label, distributed by MCA Records, aims to sign new young artists; its first three are singers Ella Brooks and Jimmy Davis and comedian Gilbert Gottfried. Mr. Pittman hired Les Garland, who had been MTV's senior vice president of programming, to run the unit. Mr. Garland has strong relationships with radio programmers nationwide, &quot;and we think we can use our contacts and our experience to promote and advertise new artists,&quot; Mr. Pittman says.    Drawing on some techniques MTV made famous, Mr. Pittman and Mr. Garland decided to use video clips of Ms. Brooks's songs on a &quot;collector's edition&quot; videocassette of the April 6 &quot;Superfight&quot; between Marvin Hagler and Sugar Ray Leonard in Las Vegas. The cassette, which hit home-video stores two weeks after the fight, includes behind-the-scenes footage of the bout, highlights from previous fights and a three-minute video of Ms. Brooks belting out &quot;It's Easy When You're on Fire,&quot; interspersed with fight highlights. Says Mr. Pittman, &quot;We like to take a multimedia approach to projects.&quot;    Mr. Pittman also is developing some movie projects with relatively low budgets -- in the $4 million-to-$7 million range -- and some television programs. Mr. Pittman says that he learned to work on slim production budgets at MTV and plans to use that cost-conscious approach in his new ventures. He adds that Quantum also is &quot;actively shopping for troubled assets&quot; such as radio station groups that he can use his programming expertise to improve.    Mr. Pittman says he wanted to avoid &quot;becoming the Dick Clark of the '80s&quot; -- perennially associated with teens and music video. Although he still travels frequently and remains enmeshed in the music world, he says his life is considerably more settled than in his heyday in the radio business and in MTV's early years when he used to spend a lot of time at MTV-related events, such as concerts and parties. He spends most of his free time at home with his wife and four-year-old son in Connecticut.    Although Mr. Pittman says he occasionally misses the glamour of running MTV, he insists, &quot;I happen not to like the power you get from too much success.&quot; Toward the end of his career there, he adds, &quot;I felt that if I stayed too long I would become dull-witted. My power and my identity were linked to my job -- I wanted to get back to using my brain somehow to developing something new.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
