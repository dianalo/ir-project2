Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said as the panelvoted 13-1 for Bennett.   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., an ally of teacher groups, was the lonedissenter, saying Bennett had sought a cut in the drug educationbudget in his previous post and that his record as an administratorat the department ``was not strong.''   ``My fear is that we're going to have a lot of visibility and notmuch action. I hope I'm wrong,'' Simon said.   Lawmakers were shooting for a late-afternoon Senate floor vote onBennett, although they said scheduling problems could sidetrack it.   Even before his confirmation, Bennett's responsibilities wereincreasing, with President Bush handing him the politically volatileissue of whether to ban the sale of semi-automatic weapons.   Bennett met Wednesday with National Rifle Associationrepresentatives to seek ``input and advice,'' said Bennett spokesmanDon Hamilton. ``I'm rather confident he has not made up his mind.''   Bennett, whose designated job often has been referred to as``drug czar,'' can now add the title ``gun czar,'' joked Hamilton.   ``He's not too upset about it, really,'' he said.   But although he hasn't made up his mind whether assault weaponsshould be banned, Bennett's eventual stance is certain to promptsome disagreement in the White House. Bush, a member of the NationalRifle Association, has said he opposes a ban, while first ladyBarbara Bush supports one.   A host of drug-related shootings and the killing of fiveCalifornia schoolchildren have prompted calls for a ban on theassault-style weapons.   Bennett is ``concerned with the problem and he'd like to seek asolution that's consonant with the Constitution and individuals'rights concerning firearms. But he doesn't want to see thatfirepower in the hands of drug traffickers and other bad guys,''Hamilton said.   The issue came up at Bennett's confirmation hearings last weekwhen Sen. Edward M. Kennedy asked him about a memo he wrote lastyear when he was education secretary.   In the March 14, 1988, memo to then-Attorney General Edwin MeeseIII, Bennett asked Meese to consider supporting legislation ``tobetter manage the production, importation and sale of automaticweapons and other firearms, as sought by the major law enforcementorganizations.''   Bennett hesitated when asked during the hearings whether he nowsupports legislation limiting access to weapons such as modifiedAK-47s and Uzis. The tightly regulated military versions can beswitched easily back and forth from semi-automatic to automatic.   He told the committee his decision on that issue would be part ofthe national drug control strategy, due 180 days after he takesoffice.   ``I will admit a personal reservation about private ownership ofAK-47s,'' Bennett told the committee. ``I'm not a gun owner. ... Thepresident knows I have my concerns.''   Asked by committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del, whetherhe believes there's a correlation between easy access to weapons andthe violence of drug dealing, Bennett said, ``I don't think there'sany doubt about it.''   However, he added, ``You still have to take the people's right tobear arms seriously.''   He left open the possibility that he may ultimately disagree withBush's opposition to a ban.   ``The fact that it's been spoken about by the president does notmean it's off the table,'' Bennett said at the hearings.   Bush said at a news conference Tuesday that he discussed thetestimony with Bennett afterward.   ``I told Bill, I said, `Look, I don't worry about what you saidup there,''' Bush said. ``I said, `I can identify with what wasbehind your thinking on that very, very easily. I'd like to findsome accommodation.'''   Bush said that if Bennett comes up with a ``sensible'' proposal,``I'll take a hard look at it.''</TEXT></DOC>
