Not today's, not tomorrow's.   That said, it's still fun to hold the futurists toaccount. The following are seven images of high technology inthe home, dreamed up by some of history's notable visionaries-- and seven reports on how accurate those images have turnedout to be. The main lesson, probably, is that guesses aboutthe direction of technology (yes, including those made inthis publication) shouldn't be taken too seriously. As GeorgeOrwell would be happy to learn, the only certainty aboutprophecies is that they often miss the mark.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   1516: Thomas More &quot;Utopia&quot;                                                                                                          The roofs be plain and flat, covered with a certain kindof plaster that is of no cost, and yet so tempered that nofire can hurt or perish it. . . .They keep the wind out oftheir windows with glass, for it is there much used, andsomewhere also with fine linen cloth dipped in oil or amber .. .                                                                                                          Although it isn't set in the future, Thomas More's seminalbook is an early form of futurism. Following his era'sliterary conventions, More simply places his futuristicsociety on a faraway island rather than in another time.   Although the book is mainly a political treatise, some ofthe technological features of Utopian houses remaininteresting today. Utopia's fireproof plaster, for example,might draw emissaries from the construction industry. Andglass windows have yet to be improved upon, although somecompanies are now experimenting with windows that can be madeopaque -- and perhaps, in the future, made to display videopictures -- at the touch of a button.   1888: Edward Bellamy, &quot;Looking Backward&quot;                                                                                                          She made me sit down comfortably, and, crossing the room,so far as I could see, merely touched one or two screws, andat once the room was filled with the music of a grand organanthem. . . .&quot;Grand]&quot; I cried, as the last great wave ofsound broke and ebbed away into silence. &quot;Bach must be at thekeys of that organ; but where is the organ?&quot;                                                                                                          Edward Bellamy's hugely popular romance, in which the heroawakes from a mesmeric sleep to find himself in the year2000, predicts several technological advances -- although, aswith More, the author's main point is a political one.Bellamy typified the utopianism of the late 19th century,which embraced technology as a way to increase humanhappiness.   The Music Room described above is a prescient vision ofradio. Bellamy didn't foresee &quot;wireless&quot; broadcasting, butimagined that live performances would be transmitted throughspecial telephone lines to subscribers. In other words, cableradio. A cable system is now being tested in the U.S. forhigh-quality digital audio transmissions, and somecable-television companies -- especially those in Europe --tout interference-free reception of regular radio stations.   Egregiously, Bellamy makes no mention of recorded music,even though Thomas Edison's phonograph was 10 years old atthe time. He can be forgiven, however, for failing to predictthe latest stereo components -- digital sound processors thatallow listeners to &quot;reshape&quot; their living room's acoustics tomimic much larger spaces. If Bellamy had only known, his herowould have been mystified not only by organ music but also bycavernous echoes that seemed to issue from 100 yards behindhis sofa.                                                                                                          1902: H.G. Wells, &quot;Anticipations of the Reaction ofMechanical and Scientific Progress Upon Human Life andThought&quot;                                                                                                          One always imagines a cook working with a crimsoned faceand bare, blackened arms. But with a neat little range,heated by electricity and provided with thermometers, withabsolutely controllable temperatures and proper heat screens,cooking might very easily be made a pleasant amusement forintelligent invalid ladies.                                                                                                          In addition to writing some of the first true sciencefiction, H.G. Wells was also the dean of all futurism. Amongother things, he correctly predicted the growth of suburbiaand the atom bomb. In his &quot;Anticipations,&quot; which started as aseries of articles envisioning life at the end of thecentury, Wells anticipates the transformation of the era'sdark, sooty kitchens to bright, clean rooms where even theidle rich experiment with recipes. Clearly, he wouldn't havebeen surprised to find that many cookery books became bestsellers by the close of the millennium.   But even the gadget-happy Wells never hinted at many ofthe myriad devices that populate today's kitchens -- talkingrefrigerators, fuzzy-logic bread makers, dishwashers withbrains as powerful as early computers. Especially puzzlingwould be the microwave oven, a truly new technology that hasbecome so commonplace and easy to use that companies now sellmicrowavable snacks that little kids can nuke for themselves.                                                                                                          1932: Aldous Huxley, &quot;Brave New World&quot;                                                                                                          A blast of warm air dusted her with the finest talcumpowder. Eight different scents and eau-de-Cologne were laidon in little taps over the wash-basin. She turned on thethird from the left, dabbed herself with chypre and, carryingher shoes and stockings in her hand, went out to see if oneof the vibro-vacuum machines were free.                                                                                                          Futurism turned pessimistic after the Great War, andtechnological progress began to be feared because of itspotential for abuse -- a more sophisticated fear than thevisceral Luddism of previous eras. To dramatize such fears,dystopian literature flourished and reached an apotheosis ofsorts in Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World,&quot; which depicted anominous society of genetic manipulation and drug-hazedconsumerism.   Like the rest of the book, Huxley's vision of hometechnology depended heavily on sensuality. In the home, thedecadent tone of his other inventions -- scent organs,synthetic music, and feelies (movies where the audienceactually &quot;felt&quot; the action) -- had its most naturalexpression in the bathroom, to which his characters retreatedas regularly as cocaine addicts. But strangely, apart fromthe still-rare Jacuzzi, technology has had little to sayabout the bathroom since the advent of indoor plumbing.   Innovation seems to entail putting more nozzles in ashower stall or heating toilet seats. Despite an emergingJapanese interest in the electronic bathroom, the only widelyused modern items that echo Huxley's lush vision -- apartfrom potpourri, which continues to exert its low-tech charm-- are cheesy gadgets such as electric back-massagers and&quot;aroma disks&quot; that play on mail-order scent diffusers.                                                                                                          1949: George Orwell, &quot;1984&quot;                                                                                                          &quot;Smith]&quot; screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen.&quot;6079 Smith W] Yes, you] Bend lower, please] You can dobetter than that. You're not trying. Lower, please] That'sbetter, comrade.&quot;                                                                                                          Anyone who sweats regularly through a Jane Fonda workouttape will cringe at George Orwell's dark vision of &quot;PhysicalJerks,&quot; daily exercises coordinated and enforced throughtelescreens, the two-way video screens that monitor the dingylives of the citizens of Oceania. Fortunately, two-wayscreens linked to the government aren't yet standard issue inour homes -- though it could be argued that the spirit of BigBrother lurks now in ordinary devices such as pagers, creditcards and cellular telephones.   Inside the home, two-way communication has never reallycaught on. Household intercom systems flared and died yearsago and, while many cordless telephones now double as in-homepagers, most parents are probably relieved to have the kidsout of mind. In a corporate experiment that may someday reachthe home, a Xerox Corp. lab is now testing a system oftwo-way video screens that allows workers to &quot;enter&quot; anotheroffice for a chat -- or stay tuned in all day, just like atelescreen. Unlike Big Brother's screens, however, thesemonitors can be switched off.                                                                                                          1952: Ray Bradbury, &quot;The Veldt&quot;                                                                                                          Perhaps Lydia was right. Perhaps they needed a littlevacation from the fantasy which was growing a bit too realfor ten-year-old children. . . .It seemed that, at adistance, for the past month, he had heard lions roaring, andsmelled their strong odor seeping as far away as his studydoor. But, being busy, he had paid it no attention.                                                                                                          In Ray Bradbury's chilling tale of consumerism, the Hadleyfamily falls victim to the ultimate in home technology: TheHappylife Home, &quot;which clothed and fed and rocked them tosleep and played and sang and was good to them.&quot; Central tothe story is a nursery whose walls can create convincingillusions of reality, complete with sounds and smells -- animmersion experience akin to Huxley's feelies. Things goawry, however, when the spoiled Hadley children ask thenursery to conjure up an African scene.   Much of the Happylife Home is deliberately cartoonish (thedining-room table cuts food into bite-size pieces, forinstance), but Bradbury's nursery can be seen as the ultimatein a new technology called virtual reality. In virtualreality, people don goggles, gloves and other devices thatlet them feel as if they're moving in, and interacting with,a computer-generated world. Bradbury takes it one stepfurther and creates a world so enveloping that no gloves orgoggles are needed: The viewer is swallowed up by theillusion.   Research into virtual reality is being conducted now atfirms such as VPL Research Inc., but early consumer deviceshave already emerged. For the home, Mattel Inc. makes a gizmocalled PowerGlove, which lets kids control Nintendo videogames with hand gestures. It's a long way from the Happylifenursery -- but maybe that's not such a bad thing.                                                                                                          1968: Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick, &quot;2001: A SpaceOdyssey&quot;                                                                                                          &quot;Are you coming to my party tomorrow?&quot;   &quot;I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.&quot;   &quot;Why not?&quot;   &quot;Well, you know -- Daddy's traveling.&quot;                                                                                                          Daddy, of course, is calling home from a Bell PicturePhonewhile en route to the moon -- and paying a mere $1.70 for theprivilege. Video telephones, first demonstrated in the early1960s, are perhaps futurists' biggest flub so far: Thereasonable rates in &quot;2001&quot; notwithstanding, they have alwayscost too much to catch on. Even in the corporate world, wherevideo teleconferences were supposed to be a cheap alternativeto air travel, it wasn't until earlier this year that a firm,PictureTel, started selling a complete system for less than$20,000.   Part of the problem is infrastructure: Conventionaltelephone lines don't have the capacity to transmit movingpictures, meaning that exotic means such as satellites orspecial lines must be used. Since it will be a decade or morebefore high-capacity, fiber-optic cables are commonplace,video phones won't become a household appliance for a longtime. In the meantime, Japanese consumer-electronics firmshave been offering phones that can transmit still images;they've met with an understandably tepid response. Similarly,other relatively modest prophecies of &quot;2001&quot; -- a permanentspace station, for example -- are years behind schedule. Thehuman-seeming HAL 9000 computer, of course, is only slightlycloser to reality than he was when Arthur C. Clarke dreamedhim up.   Still, one piece of &quot;2001&quot; technology has already made itinto many homes: a computer that can wallop most humans atchess. It may not seem like much compared with HAL, who wassupposedly completed in 1992 to be &quot;foolproof and incapableof error.&quot; But then again, HAL ultimately snapped and turnedhomicidal. Some prophecies are best left unfulfilled.   ---   Mr. Hooper is a staff reporter in The Wall StreetJournal's London bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
