The vote sending the treaties to the Senate for ratification was16-2.   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said the treaties are of ``vitalimportance'' in forging cooperation to assist the United States ingathering evidence to prosecute narcotics cases.   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said they should not be approvedby the committee or ratified by the Senate because they might placeAmericans in the situation of being prosecuted in foreign courtswithout full constitutional protections.   He also said the United States should not ratify such treatieswith Mexico or the Bahamas because they have top legal officialssuspected of corruption and involvement in protecting drugtrafficking.   Helms accused the Bush administration of ``a massive coverup''of information linking these officials to alleged narcoticscorruption.   But Kerry and other senators said the treaties are supportedfully by the Bush administration as a useful tool in the war ondrugs.   They said the president and Justice Department retain theability to deny frivolous requests by foreign governments and toprotect the constitutional rights of Americans.</TEXT></DOC>
