Some 40 members of the House joined the Federation for AmericanImmigration Reform in announcing that the suit would be filedThursday in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh, spokesmen said at anews conference here.   The group contends that including the estimated 2 million ormore illegal aliens in the national head count, which is used todistribute seats in the House of Representatives, will cause unfairshifts of seats from one state to another.   Census officials say they are required to count everyone by theU.S. Constitution, which does not mention citizenship but onlyinstructs that the House apportionment be based on the ``wholenumber of persons'' residing in the various states. That approachwas upheld by a federal court in a similar suit, brought by thesame immigration reform group, before the 1980 Census.   Nonetheless, Dan Stein of the immigration reform federationcontended that illegal aliens should not be allowed to be part ofdetermining the political structure of the United States.   Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., said the Census Bureau should actuallycount everyone but that it should develop a method to determine howmany people are illegally in the country, and them deduct thatnumber from the figures used for reapportioning Congress.   Rep. Jan Meyers, R-Kan., suggested including a question on theCensus form asking whether respondents are U.S. citizerns.</TEXT></DOC>
