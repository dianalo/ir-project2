The move by the country's biggest brokerage goes further thansimilar policies of other securities firms and could encourageothers to take a tougher stance to protest South Africa's practicesof racial separation, The Wall Street Journal reported.   The story appeared on a day when the South African governmentannounced the repeal of a major segregation law, called theSeparate Amenities Act.   President F.W. de Klerk said the government will open allwhites-only beaches to blacks and repeal the law allowing localauthorities to segregate public facilities.   Merrill Lynch's move, announced in an internal memorandum toemployees, reflects growing public outcry that Wall Street firmscontinue to maintain ties to South Africa, the Journal said.   Other financial firms, such as Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,already don't do business with South Africa, its corporations andindividuals.   The sweeping new policies reportedly mean Merrill Lynch will nolonger do securities research on South African companies and won'toffer investment recommendations on their stocks.   Also, Merrill Lynch will no longer handle the buying or sellingof South African shares for customers. This extends to Americandepositary receipts for South African stocks plus warrants andother instruments. An ADR is a vehicle for U.S. investors to tradein foreign securities.   Researchers at Merrill Lynch will keep track of certain SouthAfrican industries, such as gold mining, but won't comment onindividual companies, the newspaper said.   A spokesman for Merrill Lynch did not immediately return atelephone call seeking comment on the report.</TEXT></DOC>
