It was unclear whether Gorbachev approved the document beforeleaving on vacation Sunday.;    The new document retains many cardinalchanges, including rejection of the party's totalitarian past. It says theparty's goal is &quot;humane, democratic socialism&quot; and proclaims that Communistsstand for &quot;economic, political and spiritual freedom.&quot;;    But hard-linerscomplained during the Central Committee meeting that the radical draft lackedany mention of communism or its founders -- Marx, Engels and Lenin. The latestversion contains such references.;    Other changes include:;    (check)Restoration of strong language on the duties of Communist Party members,including payment of monthly dues, participation in local party organizationsand adherence to the party line. The radical draft had called for voluntarydonations instead of dues.;    (check) Removal of a sentence that saidCommunists elected to legislative bodies owed first allegiance to theirconstituents, rather than to the party.;    (check) Removal of a paragraphthat criticized Bolshevism as a political movement marked by &quot;the flights offancy and insight, as well as the illusions, of the late 19th to early 20thCentury.&quot;;    The draft published today has been forwarded to local partyorganizations across the Soviet Union for discussion. Final adoption isexpected at the 29th Party Congress of delegates from around the country inlate November.;    The changes have been widely viewed as an attempt by theparty to regain some of the prestige and political initiative that it has lostduring the six years of Gorbachev's reforms.;    The Communists, who gave uptheir constitutional monopoly on power last year, have lost more than 4million members in the past 18 months. Membership now stands at about 15million.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Moscow  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910808  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  28F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  405  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday August 8, 199100221104,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
