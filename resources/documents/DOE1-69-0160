Based upon the results of these studies, the 1982 referenceliquid metal cooled tandem mirror fusion breeder blanket design was updatedand is described. The updated reference blankets provides increased breedingand lower technological risk in comparison with the original referenceblanket. In addition to the blanket design revisions, a plant concept,cost, and fuel cycle economics assessment is provided. The fusion breedercontinues to promise an economical source of fissile fuel for the indefinitefuture.</TEXT></DOC>
