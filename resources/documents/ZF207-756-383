(The weekin review) (column)andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Seldom are the constant expansions and consolidations within the PC industryas evident as they are in this week's news.andP;  Advancing technology spawns aburgeoning array of new hardware and software that combine to createenvironments richer than the sum of their parts.andM;The future consolidation of the Windows and OS/2 Presentation Managergraphical interfaces is our top story this week.andP;  IBM and Microsoft -- bothbetting heavily on the success of OS/2 -- hope to capitalize on a recentupturn in applications development under Windows, which its OS/2 counterparthas yet to achieve.andM;The combination of OS/2 networking, SQL database technology andgroup-scheduling functions known as &quot;groupware&quot; is another topic on Page 1.andO;If the initial product of startup Coordination Technology attains its loftygoals, it will bring together OS/2's multitasking capabilities and thepowerful data-manipulation functions of SQL in a way that could finally helpOS/2 live up to expectations.andM;OS/2 is also the umbrella under which micro-to-mainframe leader DigitalCommunications Associates plans to consolidate its dizzying softwaresmorgasbord.andP;  Our story on Page 6 details DCA's plans to unify its softwareline and provide a consistent interface and programming environment.andM;Continuing the consolidation trend, the long-awaited release of the OpenSoftware Foundation's Motif graphical user interface, detailed on Page 10, isexpected to yield applications early next year that could begin to unify theincreasingly divided Unix community.andP;  Motif itself combines the look and feelof OS/2 PM with Unix programming tools by DEC.andP;  Stranger bedfellows are hardto find.andM;Similarly, the Hardware section notes the marriage of RISC with the Macintoshplatform, in Tektronix's release of a RISC coprocessor board for the Mac.andO;The Tektronix board is based on Motorola's 88000 processor, which gainedmomentum as well from last week's introduction of 88000-based departmentalservers from Unisys.andM;The integration of the Windows interface and the popular PC Focus databaselanguage with Wang's minicomputer-based image-processing software, discussedin our Analysis on Page 35, may be too little, too late, to push imageprocessing into the mainstream of corporate computing.andM;Two stories on Page 75 note that the union of existing applications with theupcoming Windows 3.0 release will not be trouble-free for programs thatsidestep key Windows programming conventions.andM;Finally, our Management section chronicles the continuing struggle tointegrate network technology into the corporate mainstream with a pair ofstories on Page 85 that examine the efforts at two specific corporate sites.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
