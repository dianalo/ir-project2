Gasoline futures prices pulled back.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August contract for WestTexas Intermediate rose 23 cents to $20.48 per 42-gallon barrel. Thecontract closed with a gain of 54 cents on Monday.   Contracts for later delivery of WTI, the benchmark grade of U.S.crude, posted similar increases.   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the Julycontract for No.2 heating oil gained 0.88 cent to settle at 50.53cents a gallon, adding to Monday's gain of 0.16 cent. Other contractmonths of heating oil also finished higher.   The contact for July delivery of unleaded gasoline edged down by0.01 cent to 63.68 a gallon after Monday's surge of 0.77 cent.Contracts for August, September and October gasoline delivery alsodeclined.   Mary L. Haskins, a vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,said the rally in the crude futures pits was sustained with the helpof technical buying.   Buying bred more buying as traders pushed the price of crudefutures past thresholds considered significant.   ``The technicals have pointed upward now for a week and a halfand until we get some dramatic bearish news the market will keepmoving higher,'' said Haskins. ``The market looks like it wants tohead to $21 or $21.20 (a barrel) in the near term.''   The market also has been getting a lift this week from news thatsome OPEC members intend to curb crude production.   Published reports have said Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates,two chronic overproducers, will reduce their output levels closer tothe amount desired by the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries.   Kuwait previously had rejected its OPEC-imposed productionceiling and set its own quota.   Both Kuwait and the UAE reportedly now plan to scale backproduction levels but keep them above the amount mandated by the oilcartel at a meeting in Vienna, Austria, earlier this month.</TEXT></DOC>
