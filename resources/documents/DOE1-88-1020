Etch decorationtransmission electron microscopy is the principal technique employedin the study. The monolayer channeling action commences at approximately850{sup 0}C and involves the following sequential steps: breakage oftwo carbon-carbon bonds and dissolution of C in Ru at the {101l} edge/Ruinterface, bulk/surface diffusion of C in Ru, and reaction of C withchemisorbed H on the Ru surface. The surface reaction is the rate-limitingstep. Using a lower-bound diffusivity from filament growth data and theirexperimental value of solubility, the bulk diffusion flux of C in Ruis an order of magnitude higher than the overall rate. Furthermore, itis shown that the contribution of monolayer channeling to the overallcarbon gasification rate is at least as important as that by deep-layerchanneling.</TEXT></DOC>
