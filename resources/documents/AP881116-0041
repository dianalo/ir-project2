Iacopo ``Jake'' Gambini, a former Texas resident who is apetroleum engineer and major shareholder in General Pipe ServicesInc. of Bogota, Colombia, was abducted at gunpoint from his officeJune 24 by five members of a left-wing guerrilla group.   He was released last week after 138 days in captivity and weeksof negotiations between his captors and family members, according tohis first interview published Wednesday in The Houston Post.   The 56-year-old Gambini is one of an estimated 300 businessexecutives kidnapped in Colombia this year.   ``I feel fine,'' he said. ``I feel good. The only thing I missedwas my family. Right now it just feels good to be back with myfamily.''   The identity of his captors, who were paid an undisclosed ransom,remains a mystery.   Gambini is staying with friends at an undisclosed location in theUnited States, the Post said. He said he had not decided what to donext, but would consider going back to Colombia.   Gambini was at his office doing paperwork when five men armedwith pistols and rifles walked in.   ``They never threatened me in any way,'' he said. ``They treatedme with all the courtesy and respect you could imagine. They justsaid, `Come along.' I knew they meant business.''   He was put in a car and driven deep into the countryside where hesoon lost track of his whereabouts.   ``We moved around quite a few times,'' he recalled. ``I neverknew where we were or where we were going.''   But his captors, he said, were friendly and considerate.   ``I spent most of my days reading books they provided me, playingsolitaire or checkers and cards with them,'' he said.   Gambini said he didn't know about any negotiations and wasn'ttold in advance that he would be released.   ``But I always had the feeling that I was going to be released.And I never felt any danger.''</TEXT></DOC>
