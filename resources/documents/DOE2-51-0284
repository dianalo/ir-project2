<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-51-0284 </DOCNO><TEXT>We investigate the question of whether experimental data on the energylevels of bottomonium can discriminate between quark-antiquark potentialswhich are motivated by what we know about QCD and potentials which arepurely phenomenological. We restrict ourselves to bottomonium because,of all the quarkonia observed thus far, bottomonium is the least relativisticand therefore the best testing ground for the static quarkonium potential.We consider two potentials whose functional form is motivated from perturbativeQCD at short quark-antiquark separations and from nonperturbative latticeQCD at large separations. We also consider three strictly phenomenologicalpotentials. We find that the best of the three phenomenological potentials,which has never been previously used, fits the spin-averaged data atleast as well as the best of the QCD-motivated potentials. We proposefurther measurements on bottomium energy levels to provide additionaltests.</TEXT></DOC>
