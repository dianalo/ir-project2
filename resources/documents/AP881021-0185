DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal grand jury today indicted formerPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife on racketeeringcharges, alleging they plundered their homeland of millions ofdollars and defrauded U.S. banks.   According to the indictment, Marcos transferred $103 millioninto the United States to buy Manhattan real estate and alsodefrauded banking institutions of more than $165 million in thepurchase and financing of those properties.   The indictment charged that between 1972 and 1986, when Marcosand his wife Imelda fled to the United States, they accumulatedmillions of dollars through embezzlement, theft, bribes andkickbacks.   ``This is a plan hatched and begun in the Phillipines to movemassive amounts of money illegally into the United States,'' saidU.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani. ``Then the Marcoses came to theUnited States and continued their illegal activities.''   He said at least $250 million in property would be subject toforfeiture.   ``No one is above the law,'' Giuliani said.   The Marcoses, who have spent their exile in Hawaii, were orderedto appear in federal court Oct. 31.   In Honolulu, Marcos remained in seclusion, but hisWashington-based attorney, Richard Hibey, told reporters he hadbeen offered a ``drop dead'' deal in which government attorneysrefused to negotiate a settlement.   ``This was not a plea bargain ... it was a set of non-negotiabledemands,'' Hibey said.   Marcos ``is well, he is alert and he's looking forward todefending himself,'' Hibey said. ``Mrs. Marcos is as strong and asresolute about defending herself as the president.''   Hibey said the Marcoses will plead innocent.   Marcos' health, however, will be a major factor in the case,Hibey said.   ``I am personally concerned...that he may not be physically ableto withstand the rigors of a criminal trial of this scope andmagnitude,'' said Hibey, who described Marcos' health as ``frail.''   Also charged with racketeering were Saudi Arabian financierAdnan Khashoggi; Bienvenido Tantoco Sr., former Philippineambassador to the Vatican; his wife, Gliceria, once the presidentof Rustans, a Filipino department store; the Los Angeles-basedCalifornia Overseas Bank; its chairman, Roberto S. Benedicto; andthe bank's former president, Rodolfo T. Aranbulo.   A spokesman for President Reagan, who was in Kentucky today,said the president ``is saddened'' by the indictments becauseMarcos ``is an old friend and a friend of the country.''   ``But it's clear that the Justice Department has a very strongcase and it will proceed through the system,'' White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.   The grand jury charges are the culmination of a criminalinvestigation launched nearly 2{ years ago by Giuliani.   The six-count indictment charges the Marcoses engaged in a``pattern of racketeering activities'' to divert Philippinegovernment funds and cash and stock garnered through bribes andkickbacks to U.S. investments.   From 1981 to 1983, the Marcoses transferred $103 million to buyfour valuable Manhattan properties, including commercial buildingsat Herald Square and on Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue and WallStreet, the indictments say.   The Marcoses and their alleged co-racketeers were also accusedof obstucting justice in a civil lawsuit filed by the Filipinogovernment to reclaim the Manhattan properties.   The Marcoses, the Tantocos and Khashoggi allegedly plotted toconceal the true ownership of the four buildiungs through falsedocuments.   The Marcoses are also accused of a scheme to buy $5.9 million inart objects and also transporting money and certain works of artthey knew to be stolen.   The indictment also charges that the Marcoses and Tantocosdefrauded two U.S. banks _ Citibank and Security Pacific NationalBank _ and the Security Pacific Mortgage Corp. of more than $165million in order to buy one of the buildings and refinance others.   Under the racketeering laws, the government is seekingforfeiture of all the defendants' property obtained through illegalactivity. For the Marcoses, that includes the four New Yorkbuildings, foreign bank accounts and other property interest theyhold.   The government also is seeking forfeiture of Khashoggi'scondominium at the posh Olympic Towers in Manhattan, as well asbank accounts and any interest he holds in the four buildings.   The indictment charges Khashoggi joined a scheme to backdate hisinterest in the Marcos-owned buildings to prevent the Philippinesfrom winning them in U.S. court.   Khashoggi is also accused of submitting a false document toFrench officials seeking evidence at U.S. request in the Marcosinvestigation.   All of those charged with racketeering and racketeeringconspiracy face a maximum of 20 years in prison and $250,000 infines on each count.   The Marcoses, the Tantocos, their son Bienvenido Jr., JaimeAlberto Arias _ a Panamanian attorney associated with the Tantocos_ and Khashoggi associate Karl Bock Peterson were charged with onecount of obstructing justice and one count of mail fraud for theirpart in the scheme to conceal the ownership of the buildings. Theywould face up to five years in prison on each count if convicted.   Khashoggi would face an additional 15-year penalty on each oftwo obstruction of justice counts.   Khashoggi, a central figure in the secret sale of arms to Iranby the Reagan administration, posed as the owner of valuablepaintings and New York property secretly held by the Marcoses,according to court documents filed earlier.   The Justice Department decided to move against Marcos, 71, afterhis lawyers, involved in plea bargaining negotiations with federalprosecutors, missed a deadline Thursday afternoon to respond to ademand that he plead guilty to a racketeering charge, according tofederal sources in Washington.   Earlier Thursday, President Reagan indicated he would step asideand not intervene to stop a Marcos indictment, saying that in orderto bring the matter to him, ``I would think that it would have tobe a matter of foreign policy.''   Reagan said, ``It may not come to my desk at all.''   Engaging in plea bargaining discussions prior to indictment wasa concession by the Justice Department to the State Department,which urged such a course in an attempt to avoid indicting theformer head of state. Justice Department officials had wanted anindictment to precede any plea bargaining negotiations.   In Manila, Philippine officials today hailed reports of animpending indictment of Marcos as a major breakthrough in effortsto collect the billions he allegedly embezzled as president.   The Philippine government has filed 39 civil suits againstMarcos seeking to collect $96.7 billion in damages. But no criminalcharges have been filed because officials fear Marcos would insiston his constitutional right to return to the Philippines fromHawaii to face his accusers in court since the Philippineconstitution forbids criminal trials in absentia.   On Thursday, President Corazon Aquino said that a U.S.indictment of Marcos would speed recovery of the embezzeled funds.She said Marcos would still be subject to prosecution in thePhilippines regardless of American legal moves.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had indicated last weekthat Reagan would be the ultimate arbiter on the delicate matter ofindicting a onetime U.S. ally, but on Thursday, Fitzwater backedaway from that.</TEXT></DOC>
