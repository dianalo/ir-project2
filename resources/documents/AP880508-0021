KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate is expected to open debate on thenew U.S.-Soviet missile treaty this week, provided the White Houseand the Kremlin can resolve last-minute questions over verificationprovisions and the use of futuristic technology.   ``We're still conferring with the Senate and hope to come to aresolution by Tuesday evening,'' an administration official said.``We have discussed this with the Soviets and ... we feel confidentit can be resolved,'' said the official, who asked not to beidentified.   While only a handful of senators are on record as opposed to thetreaty, it is an open question whether there is time to ratify itbefore President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev opentheir Moscow summit meeting on May 29.   Senate Majority leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia,resisting appeals from Reagan, has said he will not be driven bythe approaching summit or by any other outside factor.   Last month, Byrd set Wednesday as a tentative date for theopening of debate on the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INFtreaty if the outstanding issues can be resolved.   On Monday and Tuesday the Senate will consider legislationauthorizing $299.5 billion in spending for the Pentagon. The billalso calls for increased spending on non-nuclear weapons in theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization to help reduce Sovietsuperiority in such arms.   Three Senate committees _ Intelligence, Armed Services andForeign Relations _ will spend Monday and Tuesday looking for waysto resolve the four outstanding issues:   _Futuristic weapons: Byrd wants a legally binding, writtencommitment from the Kremlin setting out the extent to which the newtreaty covers medium-range weapons using laser rays, particle beamgenerators or other technology still on the drawing boards.   _Futuristic weapons verification: Byrd wants a SenateIntelligence Committee report on the ability of U.S. intelligenceagencies to verify a ban on futuristic weapons.   _Verification: Byrd wants the Soviets to make clear they willlive up to treaty terms that require intrusive on-site inspectionto detect cheating. Some Soviet officials have been quoted assaying certain practices would not be allowed on Soviet soil. Byrdtold reporters recently he wants to make sure the Soviets are notbacking away from treaty requirements.   _Intelligence: Byrd wants a Reagan administration commitmentthat it will significantly increase long-range spending for U.S.intelligence efforts to monitor Soviet compliance with treaties,including obtaining more effective spy satellites.   Reagan and Gorbachev signed the INF treaty in a White Houseceremony last Dec. 8.   Since then, the pact has been subjected to intense scrutiny bythe Foreign Relations Committee, which has primary jurisdictionover treaties, as well as by the Armed Services and Intelligencepanels, each focusing on their areas of expertise.   If it goes into effect, the pact would require the eliminationof U.S. and Soviet ground-launched missiles with ranges between 300and 3,400 miles.   A leading sticking point in the controversy over whether or notfuturistic weapons are included in the medium-range weapon ban isthe fact the treaty contains no definition of exactly whatconstitutes a ``weapon delivery vehicle.''   U.S. negotiators testified that they and their Sovietcounterparts made no attempt to define terms that had a generallyunderstood meaning and that the word ``weapon'' fell into that list.   Maynard Glitman, the chief U.S. negotiator, testified that whilethe subject of futuristic weapons was never specifically raised inthe negotiations, the term ``weapon delivery vehicle'' covers anymedium-range missile _ however armed _ if it is able to destroy atarget.   An initial Soviet attempt last month to resolve the issue wentawry in confusion over differences in two translations of a letterfrom Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to Secretary ofState George P. Shultz.   During the defense bill debate, amendments are likely to bothincrease spending for NATO and also call for U.S. allies in the16-nation alliance to pay more of NATO's costs.   Also expected are proposals providing advice to Reagan from bothconservative Republicans and liberal Democrats about the armscontrol policies he should follow in the last six months of hisadministration.   The House is expected to give final approval Wednesday to itsPentagon bill. Similar action by the Senate will send the separatemeasures to a House-Senate conference committee to reconcile thedifferences.</TEXT></DOC>
