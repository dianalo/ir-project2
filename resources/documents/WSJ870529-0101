Glenn Brindel said, &quot;There are some funny things going on in the Gulf.&quot; The &quot;funny things&quot; are occurring as well in Washington.    Capt. Brindel, like other patriotic military officers such as Marine Col. Timothy Geraghty, who saw 241 of his men killed in the 1983 barracks bombing in Beirut, will be subject to intensive investigations and second-guessing. It is time that the civilian superiors who ordered them and their men into the midst of Middle East war zones themselves become the major focal point of inquiries. The questions concerning the operation of sophisticated military equipment and systems are important, but they are secondary.    The major questions concern why the Reagan administration has insisted on landing troops in the middle of civil wars and on sailing ships up and down a war zone 8,000 miles from home.    After losing 37 men in a surprise attack by Iraqi aircraft, the president of the U.S. curiously blamed Iran, which he called &quot;the real villain in the piece.&quot; Ever since the revelations of the Iran arms deal, the Reagan administration has swung the other way in an unseemly political rush to distance itself from Iran. This began with the massive publicity criticizing Iran for placing missiles with the capacity to cover the Strait of Hormuz. It has continued with the Iraqi &quot;inadvertent&quot; act of aggression against an American ship. Rather than challenging the perpetrator, the U.S. instead ominously warned Iran.    It can be assumed that if Iranian missiles had killed American sailors, the U.S. would have immediately retaliated with air strikes against that country. Such a war may still come. Its chances increase daily as Washington inserts naval escorts into the Gulf while preparing to re-flag Kuwaiti oil tankers as American vessels.    The U.S. must beware of becoming directly involved in a regional conflagration that is already the longest Middle Eastern war of the century. Prudent policy translates to strict neutrality. The tilt to the Iraqi position threatens to become an uncontrollable skid.    Why should this be? It is Iraq that invaded Iran on Sept. 22, 1980. It is Iraq that initiated the use of chemical weapons. It is Iraq, largely armed by the Soviet Union, that began the massive missile attacks into civilian centers. It is Iraq that has fired on the overwhelming majority of the tankers in the Gulf, and now the USS Stark.    Any U.S. strike on Iran would be a colossal mistake. Iran mustn't be confused with Grenada or Libya. It is in many ways the superpower of the Gulf. It has a battle-hardened military of nearly one million men. Its population equals that of the other seven Gulf states put together.    Attempts by the U.S.S.R. to exert a presence in the area are cited by some who favor flying the U.S. flag near the war zone. The Soviets are in Afghanistan, only 300 miles from the Gulf, but given that fact, Iran now has more than 2,000 miles of common border with a communist power to which it is avowedly hostile. In view of the Iranian influence over the Gulf, and its animus toward Moscow, any U.S. fears of the waterway becoming a &quot;Soviet lake&quot; would seem misplaced. Iran could make such a move intolerable for an already beleaguered Mikhail Gorbachev.    Furthermore, it is Iran that has pursued an oil-production and -pricing policy most consistent with America's needs. With the eventual cooperation of the Saudis, Iran has moved to limit production and increase prices to near $20 a barrel, easing the strain on the U.S. oil patch. Moreover, unless driven to it out of desperation, Iran will not close the Strait of Hormuz because that isthmus represents Iran's own economic lifeline.    Until now, Iran has scrupulously avoided any attacks on American ships in the Gulf. However, the existence of more potential targets in a rather chaotic battle area opens up new possibilities for mishap. If the Reagan administration wants a military confrontation with Iran, it will undoubtedly get one. The first steps toward this end have already been taken. The short-term consequences could be very costly for the U.S., the long-run effects even worse. Among other things, these would involve the indefinite alienation of the major Gulf power, the opportunity for the Soviet Union to reverse its own obvious failure in revolutionary Iran and a wild oil price scenario that could cripple the American economy.    The blue waters of the Persian Gulf already run red with the blood of nearly a million Iranians and Iraqis who have died in the war. Before American lives contribute further to this ghastly coloring process, it is time for U.S. leaders to ask fundamental policy questions concerning America's real national interests in the Gulf. It is a time for cooler and clearer heads to prevail in Washington.    ---   Mr. Bill is director of the Center for International Studies at the College of William and Mary, and author of &quot;The Eagle and the Lion: America and Iran,&quot; forthcoming from Yale University Press.
