STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   East Germany, once the Soviet Union's staunchestideological ally, has embarked on an unprecedented campaign ofcensorship aimed at bridling the spread of the Kremlin's new reformpolicies.   The seriousness of the campaign became clear Nov. 20 when EastGermany's Communist government slapped a first-ever, open-ended banon a Soviet publication, a magazine called Sputnik.   The campaign has pitted East Germany's aging and conservativeleaders in the most dramatic form yet against reformers in theSoviet Union, whose re-examinations of Soviet history have led to apublic debate on a scale unheard of in East Germany.   East German leaders have long resisted President Mikhail S.Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, and other reforms, ongrounds that such critical discussions of problems in East Germanyare unnecessary.   Recent speeches by Communist Party leaders have reiterated thegovernment's rejection of the Soviet reforms course.   However, the recent actions have signaled the boldest moves yetby the government to distance itself from the debate in Moscow andto insulate the nation's population from the popular changes.   Gorbachev's policies enjoy enormous support among East Germanswho hope his influence will bring about change in one of EasternEurope's most tightly controlled societies.   East German party leaders have occasionally blocked thedistribution of newspapers from Warsaw Pact neighbors in the past _during the 1968 Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia and the earlyperiods of labor unrest in Poland.   Selected issues of Soviet magazines have also been blocked. Butuntil the decision on the monthly magazine Sputnik, no outright banhad ever been imposed on a Soviet magazine.   The decision was followed quickly with an order removing fiveSoviet films dealing with Stalinist themes from theaters across thecountry.   Authorities also canceled an East Berlin cabaret production thatpoked fun at the government's reluctance to accept Gorbachev'sreform policies.   The banning of Sputnik followed its publication of articlescritical of the late Josef Stalin and Germany's communists beforeAdolf Hitler took power in Germany in 1933.   Stalin, who died in 1953, holds a special place in official EastGermany as a liberator in World War II and as the Soviet leader whohelped found the new communist nation in 1949.   East German leaders were outraged over an article in Sputnik'sOctober issue that suggested that Stalin ``had been a mere puppet ofHitler'' after the two nation's signed a mutual non-aggression pactin 1939 and that Germany's communists had indirectly aided Hitler'srise to power by not ``joining together with Social Democrats'' tostop him.   The Sputnik article also charged that German communists followed``Stalin's order to stop all anti-fascist propaganda'' after thepact was signed.   Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.   Distribution of the October Sputnik was ordered halted shortlyafter it appeared in East Germany.   ``These (historical) issues go to the very root of their(communist East German leaders') existence,'' said Stefan Heym, aprominent East German author, told The Associated Press in EastBerlin.   ``These (articles) upset the picture of the world they want todepict.'   Erich Honecker, the East German leader, along with a substantialnumber of the nation's ruling Politburo members were members of theprewar German Communist Party and pride themselves on having foughtfascism.   Honecker was imprisoned by the Nazis and thousands of communistswere slain. Shortcomings of the movement or of party leaders at thetime have not been a matter for debate in the East German media.   In an article defending the Sputnik ban, the Communist Partyorgan Neues Deutschland charged that the publication ``not onlydistorts Soviet history, but the history of the German CommunistParty.''   ``The magazine, and we say this openly, defames Germancommunists.''   While carefully emphazing that Sputnik was ``not an officialorgan'' of the Soviet Communist Party, Neues Deutchland added that``distorted visions of Soviet history, distributed here, areincompatible with our friendship with the Soviet Union.''   Soviet officials defended the magazine, saying it ``mirrors aplurality of opinion in the Soviet press.''</TEXT></DOC>
