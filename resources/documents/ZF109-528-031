(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Caroline HallidayandM;Selecting a payroll system for an organization is a complex issue.andP;  Asuitable payroll program must fit current as well as future needs.andM;Buyers must select a system from a company that can supply all the supportservices needed, including training the users and updatingandM;the software.andP;  The software must be able to cope with, for example, changesin local, state or federal tax laws.andM;It may be acceptable for users to make these adjustments in the short term,but as more changes are made, the importance of the original softwaremanufacturer supplying the updates becomes significant.andP;  Buyers should choosea company with a proven track record.andM;The arguments for PC-based payroll are considerable.andP;  PC-based payrollpackages must be capable of calculating tax deductions and earnings, andgenerating pay cycles at user-defined intervals.andM;When using a mainframe or service bureau, for example, the human-resourcesdepartment must wait for an outside department or company to perform thesefunctions.andM;In addition, doing payroll on PCs allows a company to reduce the number ofpeople with access to the data to a bare minimum.andM;Some PC payroll programs are designed as modules of a larger human resourcesinformation system (HRIS) program.andM;These modules provide a link between personnel, benefits and payroll data.andO;For companies that have already automated their human-resource systems, thisapproach, resulting in a fully integrated system, may be preferable.andM;Typically, however, the HRIS systems involve a higher cost and require moremanpower.andM;A low-cost payroll system that includes all the payroll features desired maybe a better option for companies automating only part of theirhuman-resources departments.andM;Human-resources software vendors expressed differing opinions on the state ofthe market.andM;&quot;Although it may seem like payroll is a standard human-resources function[not requiring input from other sources], it is, in fact, linked to benefits,regulations and taxes,&quot; said Jim Foster, director of sales and marketing forThe Human Resource product line at Dandamp;B Software, a division of Dun andamp;Bradstreet Corp., in Atlanta.andP;  &quot;The main thing to look for in payrollsoftware is a lot of flexibility.andP;  It should be able, for example, to domultiple deductions for an employee.&quot;andM;&quot;The rules for evaluating payroll software are the same as for any software,&quot;said Reed Hazen, vice president of customer service at RealWorld Corp., inConcordandM;N.H., a vendor of RealWorld Accounting software.andM;&quot;You must first look for the need and then find a product to fit.andP;  Your needmay be due to lack of information, slow turnaround or lack of control.&quot;andM;There can be some trade-offs when putting payroll software on a PC.andM;While PC-based payroll software affords more control and security than usinga mainframe or a service bureau, buyers should accept a reduction inperformance or functionality.andM;A good payroll system should be built around an open architecture, such as adatabase structure, so that users can do any customization necessary.andM;If the software is well-designed, most customization needs can be met byreport and table generation.andM;Users can create a report or a screen containing the desired database fieldsand calculated values, in the format required, rather than having to usesupplied, preformatted reports.andP;  Even low-cost systems with fewercustomization features should have this flexibility.andM;With the right payroll package, 386- and 486-based PCs can run payrollsoftware at a rate comparable with mainframe-based programs, even for largenumbers of employees.andM;Dandamp;B Software's Foster, citing informal benchmark tests done by his company,said, &quot;It took 4[?] hours to run the payroll [except check printing] for20,000 employees on a 486-based platform, compared with two to three hours onan IBM 4300 series mainframe.andM;&quot;Running the payroll on a 386-based platform for 1,000 employees takes about20 minutes, which is comparable with a mainframe,&quot; Foster added.andM;Many of Hazen's customers had been using manual systems and sending theresults to outside service bureaus.andP;  These customers are now automatingpayroll for the first time and are inclined to stay away from mainframesolutions.andM;&quot;The vast majority of businesses go into the marketplace with the attitudethat it will take a heck of a sales job to convince them to choose amainframe-based product,&quot;said Hazen.andM;The PC is an obvious platform for these users.andP;  Foster foresees companieswith 10,000 to 50,000 employees moving their payroll off the mainframe andonto networked PCs.andP;  This frees the mainframe for mission-critical functions,such as hospital patient care or airline reservations.andM;----------Caroline Halliday is an electrical engineer specializing in technicaldocumentation for the PC environment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
