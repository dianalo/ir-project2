Emerging from decades of political isolation under theauthoritarian regime of Gen. Francisco Franco, Spain is slowlyshaping the role that its defense forces will play in NATO.   ``We are going to allow a great deal of flexibility ... for thisnew player,'' said U.S. Gen. John Galvin, NATO's top militarycommander in Europe.   Spain formally joined NATO on May 30, 1982, rounding out theroster to 16 nations linking the United States and Canada toWestern Europe.   Four years later, the socialist government of Prime MinisterFelipe Gonzalez put its membership to a popular vote, the firstNATO member ever to do so. A little more than 50 percent of thevoters agreed the nation should remain in the alliance _ but withstrings attached.   Spain, they decided, would not be part of the integratedmilitary structure, nuclear weapons must not be stored on its soil,and the U.S. military presence in Spain must be reduced.   ``We are NATO with some special limitations,'' said Gen. AngelLobo, deputy director for international affairs in the DefenseMinistry's policy office.   No Spanish troops are under NATO's command. The only othercountry with forces outside the military structure is France, whichpulled out in 1966. Iceland, which also is a member, has no armedforces.   Unlike France, Spain takes part in key defense and nuclearstrategy sessions held regularly by the alliance. France has itsown nuclear force.   Even with conditions attached, Western officials were relievedthat Spain continued to cast its lot with the alliance.   Spain's membership, they say, strengthens the West's abilitiesto deter any threat from the East.   Lying between Portugal and France, Spain gives the allianceextra depth in Europe.   It offers important coastal access, particularly the strategicStrait of Gibraltar, which links the Atlantic Ocean and theMediterranean Sea.   Spanish defense officials have been holding a series ofdiscussions with NATO commanders to decide just how Spain willcoordinate its defense forces with those of the alliance.   ``We have to invent sometimes formulas to suit the fact that weare not integrated,'' said Miranda of the Foreign Ministry. ``Butwe want to be efficient in coordination. ... ``We have to study theway to do it. Sometimes it takes time.''   The first two of six ``coordination agreements'' are expected tobe completed by year's end. The initial accords center on the airdefense of Spanish territory and air and naval operations in theeastern Atlantic.   Next on the list for discussion are the defense of Spanishterritory and naval and air operations in the western Mediterranean.   Officials are putting off until last the most difficult areas _controlling the Strait of Gibraltar and using Spanish territory fortransit, support and rear-guard logistics.   Spain does not recognize NATO's command of Gibraltar, a Britishcolony. Spain claims sovereignty over the territory, a demandrejected by the British government and seen as an obstacle to fullparticipation in NATO's military structure.   Spain has been more successful in demanding a reduction of U.S.troops on its soil.   The U.S. and Spanish governments recently worked out anagreement to withdraw a highly visible U.S. Air Force fighter wingfrom the Torrejon Air Base on the outskirts of Madrid. The 72 F-16swill be transferred over the next three years to southern Italy.   The Spanish insistence on the unit's removal prompted complaintsthat the Gonzalez government was not shouldering its share of theWestern defense burden. The fighter wing, a crucial part of theU.S. striking power in Europe, is assigned to the defense of NATO'ssouthern flank along the Mediterranean.   But even under the new agreement, about 8,000 American troopswill continue to be stationed in Spain, many of them at the hugeRota naval base on the Atlantic.   A NATO report released in December said about 70 percent of theair-to-ground weapons training of the U.S. Air Force is conductedin Spain, along with about 50 percent of the air-to-air weaponstraining.   Moreover, the report noted that Spain has increased its militaryexpenditures.   On average over the last decade, it said, Spain was one of eightcountries that generally reached the NATO goal of increasing yearlydefense spending by 3 percent.   Still, it said, the percentage of Spain's gross domestic product_ the total value of goods and services _ earmarked for defense was``well below'' the NATO median. The expenditures amounted to 2.4percent of GDP in 1987, slipping to 2.2 percent last year.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs Aug. 23</NOTE></DOC>
