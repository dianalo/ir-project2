Dirks, the Wall Street analyst whofended off insider-trading charges brought by the Securitiesand Exchange Commission after a 10-year battle, is battlingthe SEC again.   The SEC is investigating Mr. Dirks's trading in shares andoptions of Conseco Inc., an insurance holding company, foralleged insider trading, Mr. Dirks said. Conseco shares havebeen the subject of a vocal tug of war between proponents --particularly Mr. Dirks -- and an active group of shortsellers who insist the stock is due to tumble.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Dirks, in an interview, said the SEC has subpoenaedall of his personal records, including phone books, telephonerecords, diaries, calendars, credit-card receipts andcheckbooks. He said several of his colleagues have beensubpoenaed.   Mr. Dirks, an insurance analyst at Baird, Patrick andamp; Co.,claimed that the investigation is part of a personal vendettaby the SEC and was &quot;clearly inspired&quot; by short sellers --traders who borrow and then sell a company's shares, hopingto profit by returning cheaper shares to the lender. &quot;Theidea that I had any inside information on Conseco is absurd;I think history demonstrates that,&quot; Mr. Dirks said.   In Washington, an SEC spokesman declined to comment on theinvestigation. Conseco, based in Carmel, Ind., also declinedto comment. The investigation was first reported in USAToday.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Conseco gained $2.125 to $36.875.   Mr. Dirks said he talks with Conseco once a week,sometimes more. But he said all the information he had aboutthe company was publicly available, and in any case therehaven't been major events to change the company's stockprice.   One item that has raised eyebrows among short sellers isBaird Patrick's forecast in October 1989 that Conseco wouldearn $4.50 a share in 1990. The forecast, rosier than thoseof other analysts at the time, turned out to be fairly close;the company last month reported operating earnings of $5 ashare. Mr. Dirks owns about 5,500 Conseco shares andadditional options, which have given him paper profits ofabout $130,000.   Mr. Dirks's name is in the SEC history books because of afamous insider-trading case he won before the Supreme Court.   In 1973, Mr. Dirks uncovered the Equity Fundingstock-fraud case and alerted the SEC to it. After some delay,the agency eventually investigated Equity Funding and latercharged Mr. Dirks with insider trading for notifying hisclients before the matter became public. He fought thosecharges to the Supreme Court, winning in 1983. He says thebattle cost him $750,000 in legal costs.   In the landmark decision, the high court provided adefinition of insider trading that is still cited today.   Mr. Dirks was also sanctioned by the SEC after the 1981collapse of John Muir andamp; Co., a high-flying brokerage firm inwhich Mr. Dirks was a partner. Mr. Dirks denied anywrongdoing.   Now Mr. Dirks faces a third round with the SEC. &quot;In a way,it's exhilarating to fight them again, especially when youknow you're going to win,&quot; Mr. Dirks said. &quot;On the otherhand, it's costly and time-consuming.&quot; Added the 57-year-oldanalyst: &quot;I'm not a spring chicken either.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
