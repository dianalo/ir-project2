In an advertisement in The Wall Street Journal today, theLagos bank said that &quot;unknown persons&quot; using Nigerian nameshad circulated letters, faxes and telexes solicitingassistance in transferring funds from Nigeria to offshorebank accounts. Recipients were promised a share of the fundsin exchange for sharing blank corporate stationery, invoicesand bank account information, according to the ad. To helplure participants, perpetrators used fake documents from thebank and the Federal Ministry of Finance, the bank said.</LP><TEXT>   The bank didn't give details of the extent of the fraud orname those responsible. But it said the authors of theletters are believed to belong to &quot;a syndicate ofinternational tricksters.&quot; It said that those &quot;tricksters&quot; insome cases had successfully collected &quot;huge sums of money&quot; byasking participants to pay for taxes, expenses and bribes tohelp release the funds.   The bank, which said it was surprised and embarrassed bythe situation, said it wouldn't be responsible for lossessustained by any person or corporation. It urged recipientsof the solicitations to exercise caution and to contact lawenforcement officials.   The scam appears to be part of a pattern of fraudulentactivity linked to some Nigerian groups in recent years. Theschemes, which range from the use of faked death certificatesto collect life insurance to passing worthless checks, havebeen the target of a variety of federal and localinvestigations.   Nigerian officials in the U.S. couldn't be reached forcomment.</TEXT></DOC>
