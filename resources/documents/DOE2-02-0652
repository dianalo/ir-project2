Experimental investigations oninternal flows of the turbine were conducted by using a five-hole pitottube, and the turbine was partly redesigned to improve its hydraulicefficiency. Through the model test of the revised turbine, it was confirmedthat the hydraulic efficiency was improved satisfactorily.</TEXT></DOC>
