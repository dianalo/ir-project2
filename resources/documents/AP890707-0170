Alderman Edward Burke introduced a plan Thursday that would shutdown ATMs between midnight and 6 a.m. It also would require ayearly, $200 city license and safety inspections of ATM locations bypolice.   ``We can no longer wait to take action to make these areas saferfor the residents of Chicago,'' Burke said.   Burke said his restrictions might have prevented the assault onDana Feitler, 24, who was accosted near her apartment on June 18,forced to withdraw $400 from a cash machine and then was shot in thehead.   She remains hospitalized in a coma.   ``I see these machines that hand out cash to people standing onthe street at any time of day or night and I know that they areinviting crime,'' said Police Superintendent LeRoy Martin, who isbacking Burke's plan.   Clinton Krislov, a lawyer who filed a class-action lawsuit onbehalf of bank customers following the Feitler shooting, has calledfor ATM safeguards, including more drive-through terminals to letcustomers stay in their cars, and secret ``panic'' numbers to alertpolice to a problem.   ``Banks have security to protect machines from the customers,''he said, but they don't have adequate security for those customers.   In Ms. Feitler's case, a camera at the ATM where she was robbedtook a picture only of her, but not her assailants, police have said.   David Taylor, an executive with the Bank AdministrationInstitute, a professional organization, said Friday the machines aresafe but people must use common sense.   ``It takes an extra measure of thoughtfulness and care on thepart of people using the machines at night and in remote areas,'' hesaid.   Bank customers interviewed Friday said they'd feel shortchangedif ATM use was restricted.   ``The fact that you can come and get your money anytime day ornight, that's the whole point of having these automatic tellers,''said Chris Wells.   ``They are a security problem,'' said Steve Petran, an officeworker. ``I can see where you're asking for trouble. But you have tobe aware that that's life in the city.''   Hearings on the proposed ordinance are scheduled July 18 beforethe council's Finance Committee, which Burke chairs.</TEXT></DOC>
