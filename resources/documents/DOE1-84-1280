Additionally,alternate price forecast projections are provided, in conjuction withexamples of the impact on reserve and value estimated, which occur wheneither the enclosed forecasts, or other forecasts which are similar tothe forecasts represented herein, are utilized to prepare estimates ofthe value of oil and gas assets. Also presented is a discussion of typicalerrors which can occur when sensitivity forecasts are prepared whichdo not properly consider properties which are subject to diverse operatingcost or capital investment requirements. It is concluded that the Canadianpetroleum industry has been dramatically impacted by world events during1986, highlighted as follows. The extreme volatility of world crude oilprices has a direct and dramatic impact on Canadian crude oil pricesdue to deregulation and North American spot market competition. The lowercrude oil prices which occurred during the spring and summer of 1986resulted in direct competition with natural gas as an energy sourcesin many North American markets, which has not been the case in recentyears. Oil and gas industry decisions, while historically subject toa wide range of variables, are currently affected by significantly morevolatility with regard to product prices than has been the case at anytime during the prior five years. Therefore economic sensitivity analysesshould be based on a wider range of future product price forecasts thanhas been utilized in the recent past. 9 figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
