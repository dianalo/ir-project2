The president's most senior aides agreed that no less than his vigor, his credibility, and his ability to lead the country forward were on the line. But beyond that, the consensus broke down. Top aides were sharply divided on how President Reagan should, in his sixth annual State of the Union message, move forward. They disagreed over what tone he should adopt toward the new, Democratic-dominated Congress, whether he should emphasize foreign policy or domestic concerns, what new initiatives to feature, and even on how much time and attention he should devote to the Iran-Contra affair.    The final draft of the speech reflected much of the thinking of one faction, led by presidential assistant Dennis Thomas, with substantial input from White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan. This group felt that the president should tread lightly on foreign policy, brush quickly over the Iran-Contra affair, and dwell on new frontiers in domestic policy. Although this group didn't offer any new solutions to the federal budget deficit, it believed that the president could best regain the political initiative by featuring economic prosperity, job formation and training, and &quot;competitiveness,&quot; combined under the umbrella of &quot;a search for excellence.&quot;    A White House staff member conceded that &quot;there's really not much new&quot; in these proposals, many of which had already been featured in the president's budget message, and two of which -- catastrophic health insurance and welfare overhaul -- were highlighted in last year's State of the Union address. But the Regan aides saw these measures as the best chance the president had of showing his determination to &quot;complete the work we began six years ago,&quot; as President Reagan told Republican lawmakers visiting the White House yesterday.    A second, more ideological approach was pushed by White House speechwriter Tony Dolan. In many ways it reflected the more aggressively conservative faction in the Reagan administration that has bridled against what it sees as the ideological blandness of Mr. Regan's approach. The Dolan draft pushed for monetary revision, a constitutional convention on the balanced budget, and &quot;near-term&quot; deployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative. None of these conservative chestnuts, however, survived.    One political point that didn't make it into the address was a reference to last weekend's march against racism in Georgia. White House Political Director Mitchell Daniels tried to have President Reagan speak out in support of the march, and in opposition to racism, but the effort failed.    In the end, the speech struck a conciliatory tone toward Congress, overriding the advice of Patrick Buchanan, White House communications director, who wanted the speech to flaunt recent presidential veto threats to both the Clean Water Act and the highway bill, and promise further combat in the legislative year ahead.    It adopted many of the Thomas group's suggestions on domestic and economic policy. But instead of giving short shrift to foreign affairs, as this group wanted, the president turned to a former presidential speechwriter, Ken Khachigian, to craft an address long on global vision and short on policy specifics, most of which were left for an accompanying legislative message being sent to Congress.    With Mr. Khachigian's influence, the president's speech played to Mr. Reagan's conservative support base. He trumpeted the need for more aid for the anti-Sandinista Contras in Nicaragua. And without promoting &quot;near-term&quot; deployment, he nonetheless reiterated his commitment to the Strategic Defense Initiative, and his hopes for arms control but deep concerns about the Soviet threat.    As one aide involved in the process put it, by &quot;not dwelling on the miserable details of domestic policy&quot; but instead returning to the themes that are &quot;the quintessence of Reagan,&quot; it was hoped that the president could once again &quot;sound presidential.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
