Faced with a campaign spending ``arms race'' that has pushed thecost of elective office to heights that couldn't have been imagineda decade ago, legislators around the country are gingerly calling atruce.   At least a half-dozen states have passed some form of campaignfinance reform so far this year, and reform proposals are alive inmany others.   ``I think there's more of a recognition, at least at the statelevel, that the problem of the cost of campaigns is a very seriousone,'' said Ronald Michaelson, executive director of the IllinoisState Board of Elections, who studies campaign finance developmentsnationally.   The problem varies widely from state to state, but is raisingconcern almost everywhere.   What seems expensive in Kansas, where the average campaign forthe state House of Representatives cost $18,000 last year, may bepocket change in California, where legislative seats cost anaverage of $600,000. But the trend is similar: Campaign costs havedoubled in Kansas and nearly tripled in California in the past 10years.   Experts cite several reasons. Politicians have become morereliant on expensive forms of campaigning such as direct mail andtelevision. Competition has escalated. And political actioncommittees are pumping more money into the political process.   So long as the PAC money is available, politicians will take it.Listen to Ross Johnson, a Republican who is minority floor leaderof the California Assembly and an advocate of contribution limits:``Why do you climb the mountain? Because it's there. Why do youspend the money? Because it's there.''   And how do you keep the mountain from rising? The usual answersfall into three categories: disclosure, contribution limits andpublic financing.   So far this year, at least four states _ Kansas, Maine, Montanaand New Mexico _ have strengthened their rules for campaign financedisclosure. Such rules presume that the public should at least knowwho foots the bills for their public servants.   This year's changes generally require more frequent reporting.   Contribution limits also are being tightened. Kansas lowered itsceiling for political contributions in statewide races from $3,000to $2,000, and changed the rules so that a PAC or corporation with,say, three subsidiaries can only donate $2,000 once, not four times.   Contribution limits are under consideration in several otherstates, most notably Alaska, where Gov. Steve Cowper has proposedprohibiting direct donations to candidates by corporations, unionsand PACs.   Such donations often are given by lobbyists. ``If money is themother's milk of politics,'' said Cowper, ``the people of Alaskawill not tolerate lobbyists owning the dairy.''   Contribution limits are designed to turn down the spendingspigot, or at least ensure that no single donor controls it. Butcritics question whether it lowers the spigot or just forcescandidates to find more wells.   ``If you just cut the size of the contributions ... you justmake the candidate run harder for the money,'' said Walter Zelman,director of the California chapter of Common Cause, the publicinterest lobbying group. ``They become more obsessed than ever.''   One cure for the obsession is a limit on actual campaignspending. But the Supreme Court has ruled that states can do thisonly if they also provide public financing to the candidates. Thisis the solution preferred by many reformers.   So far, 22 states have some form of public campaign funding,according to Herbert Alexander, a political science professor atthe University of Southern California. Maine voters will decide inNovember whether to add their state to the list.   Several cities have enacted public financing, including New YorkCity, which is in the midst of its first taxpayer-financedcampaign. If nothing else, it has proven that there is nothingsterile or dull about publicly financed campaigns _ and that theyaren't necessarily cheap.   Under the New York law, publicly financed candidates for mayorcan spend $6 million in the primary and general elections combined.They can get up to half that money in public funds if they take therest in small amounts from individual voters.   ``This law helps ensure that it is the breadth of a candidate'ssupport, not the depth of their pocketbook, that makes a viablecampaign,'' said City Councilwoman Ruth Messinger, who has received$281,000 in public funds so far in her race for Manhattan boroughpresident.   Even with public funding, it's clear that money and politicshave formed a lasting partnership. That worries many people, butUSC's Alexander is not among them.   ``I'm in favor of public funding, but I'm not concerned aboutthe high cost of politics,'' he said. ``Politics is pretty cheapcompared to other things we do in this country. You know, we spendmore on chewing gum than we spend on politics.''</TEXT></DOC>
