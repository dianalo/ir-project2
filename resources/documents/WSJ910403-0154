Dixon, who hasbeen described by the U.S. Justice Department as the &quot;highestof the high flyers among the savings-and-loan crooks,&quot; wassentenced to five years in federal prison for misapplyingthrift funds.   The Justice Department, which has accompanied manythrift-related indictments and convictions with pressconferences and self-congratulatory statements, had little tosay about the relatively light sentence. A spokesman said thedepartment wouldn't release a statement, as it did when Mr.Dixon was indicted last June and when he was convicted Dec.20.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Dixon, who owned Vernon Savings andamp; Loan Associationfrom 1982 until its collapse in 1987, was expected to receivea lengthy prison term on a par with the 30-year sentencegiven last year to Vernon's former chairman, Woody F. Lemons.But federal Judge A. Joe Fish, before imposing the five-yearsentence, made it clear that he wouldn't punish Mr. Dixon forany crimes the government hadn't proved to jurors.   Mr. Dixon was convicted of 23 federal charges, most ofthem related to funds that were diverted from a Vernon loanto pay for a California beach house that Mr. Dixon used.Three of the charges related to $10,000 in thrift funds thatpaid for prostitutes for Vernon board members.   Judge Fish repeatedly pointed out that none of the chargesagainst Mr. Dixon -- including 15 charges of which he wasacquitted -- dealt with Mr. Dixon's role in the questionableloans and real estate transactions that led to Vernon'slosses of more than $1 billion and its subsequent collapse.   &quot;I think Mr. Dixon is deserving of punishment for thecrimes of which he was convicted,&quot; Judge Fish said. &quot;I donot, however, think he should be punished for the failure ofVernon Savings andamp; Loan.&quot;   The judge also denied a request by the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. that he order Mr. Dixon to make restitutionof $33 million for losses on the loans that were tapped topay for the beach house.   Mr. Dixon &quot;has not been convicted of causing losses onthose loans,&quot; Judge Fish said before ordering Mr. Dixon tomake restitution of just $611,000 to cover the house paymentsand the payments to the prostitutes.   Judge Fish, appointed to the federal bench by PresidentRonald Reagan in 1983, said in court that he expects to becriticized for the sentence he imposed. Certainly, federalprosecutors and regulators weren't overjoyed by the decision.   A spokesman for the FDIC said the agency was &quot;surprisedthat Mr. Dixon did not receive a more severe sentence.&quot;Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision,called the sentence &quot;disappointing&quot; and &quot;a small price topay, given the damage Mr. Dixon did to the thrift industry.&quot;   &quot;We recommended substantial consecutive sentences,&quot; theJustice Department spokesman said. &quot;We feel we've done ourjob.&quot;   Justice Department prosecutor Robert Hauberg said provingthe cause of a thrift's failure &quot;has never been our theory ofprosecution.&quot; He declined to comment on the sentence.   Mr. Hauberg and Mr. Dixon's defense lawyer, William M.Ravkind, noted that the charges on which Mr. Dixon wasconvicted differed from the charges that led to the 30-yearsentence for Mr. Lemons, the ex-chairman. Mr. Lemons wasconvicted of 13 federal charges, including bank fraud and acharge that he accepted a $212,000 kickback from the proceedsof a $46 million real estate loan.   The case against Mr. Dixon didn't show &quot;as direct apersonal benefit&quot; as did the case against Mr. Lemons, Mr.Hauberg said.   Mr. Ravkind said he and Mr. Dixon haven't decided whetherto appeal the conviction. But Mr. Dixon, who could beeligible for parole after serving 20 months, or one-third ofthe prison term, said the judge &quot;was very fair.&quot; After thesentence was announced, he embraced his wife and familymembers, who crowded the front rows of the courtroom. &quot;We'reglad it's over,&quot; he said later. &quot;It's been a nightmare.&quot;   Both Mr. Ravkind and Mr. Hauberg acknowledged that otherpossible charges against Mr. Dixon and other Vernon insidersremain under investigation. Mr. Hauberg wouldn't elaborate onthe investigation or on why other charges against Mr. Dixonweren't brought in this case. &quot;No one knows how the case isgoing to play out at the beginning,&quot; Mr. Hauberg said. &quot;Thedecision was made . . . that this was a case the jury couldunderstand.&quot;   But John Price, an alternate juror who heard the testimonyin Mr. Dixon's trial but didn't participate in the jury'sdeliberations, criticized the government's case. &quot;The manwasn't on trial for running the Sandamp;L,&quot; said Mr. Price, aretired salesman. &quot;All they talked about was sex, sex, sex.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
