That proposed rule is withdrawn and comments receivedin response to that rulemaking will not be considered when finalizing thisnew proposed rule. The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a major rulefor the purpose of EO 12291. The Bureau of Prisons has determined thatEO 12291 does not apply to this rule since the rule involves agency management.After review of the law and regulations, the Director, Bureau of Prisonshas certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (Pub. L. 96-354), does ot have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. Interested persons may participate in this proposed rulemaking by submittingdata, views, or arguments in writing to the Bureau of Prisons, room 767,320 1st Street, NW., Washington, DC 20534. Comments received during thecomment period will be considered before final action is taken. The proposedrule may be changed in light of the comments received.

See, for example, the Freedomof Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), and the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a).A record will be released in response to a request made in accordance withthis rule, unless a valid legal exemption to disclosure is asserted. TheBureau of Prisons may assert any applicable exemption to disclosure asset forth in 5 U.S.C. 552 (b), or any other provision of federal law orregulation with respect to inmate records or any other records or documentsin the possession of the Bureau of Prisons. Pursuant to 28 CFR 16 <T3>et seq. </T3>the authority to release or deny access to records andinformation is limited to the Director or designee. Questions regardingthese legal exemptions may be referred to Regional Counsel or the Officeof General Counsel.(b) Examples of documents or information which may ordinarily be withheldfrom disclosure include, but are not limited to, the following:(1) Documents or information which might constitute an unwarranted invasionof personal privacy. Thus, information concerning an individual inmateis not generally available to other inmates or the general public unlessthe information is a matter of public record or unless the individual inmatehas given written consent to the disclosure. See generally andSection; 513.55for further information.(2) Documents or information which might reveal sources of informationobtained upon a legitimate expectation of confidentiality or otherwiseendanger the life or physical safety of any person. Thus, a statement ofan inmate witness adverse to another inmate in the context of an ongoingor a completed criminal, disciplinary, or accident investigation wouldnot be disclosed to the latter inmate if such disclosure would endangerthe inmate witness. Conversely, a statement of an inmate witness favorableto another inmate or which clearly has already been made known to thatinmate (for example, by trial testimony) may generally be disclosed tothat inmate.(3) Documents or information which might lead to a disruption of a subjectinmate's institutional program, on account of the diagnostic or evaluativeopinions contained in the document, and which could likely aggravate theinmate's clearly documented adjustment difficulties.(4) Documents or information which might interfere with ongoing law enforcementproceedings, including administrative investigations. Thus, while certaininvestigatory information might be disclosed after an administrative investigationis completed, particular care must be exercised regarding disclosure duringthe course of the investigation. With regard to criminal proceedings, questionsregarding the status of the case should be addressed to the appropriateU.S. Attorney's office.(5) Documents or information which might, through disclosure of law enforcementtechniques, information, or procedures, enable the requester to violateany law, or to threaten the security of a Bureau of Prisons institutionor the safety of any person. This exemption relates to a few OperationsMemoranda and Program Statements, and other documents such as post orders,construction diagrams, etc., the disclosure of which would pose a threatto institutional security. It also may apply to information contained ininvestigations and similar reports where law enforcement techniques mightbe outlined.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 513.33</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Placement of documents in Inmate Central File and Privacy Folder.</ITAG>(a) When documents are produced or received and are to be placed in aninmate's Central File, the following review should take place with regardto disclosure to the inmate to whom the documents pertain, or to a thirdparty with the prior written consent of the inmate:(1) If the document originates in the Bureau of Prisons (not includingcourt-ordered studies), staff shall determine whether the document shouldbe withheld from disclosure under andSection; 513.32. Otherwise, it is placedin the disclosable portion of the Inmate Central File, which is all ofthe Central File except for the Privacy Folder.(i) It should be noted that all Progress Reports prepared after October15, 1974 are subject to release and are to be placed in the non-exemptsection of the Inmate Central File. All Progress Reports prepared betweenFebruary 15 and October 15, 1974 are subject to release with the exceptionof the recommendation section. The recommendation section of Progress Reportsprepared between February 15 and October 15, 1974, and <T3>all</T3> Progress Reports prepared before February 15, 1974, will bereviewed as to disclosure in accordance with the standards contained inandSection; 513.32.(ii) A psychiatric report written at the request of the Parole Commissionis also subject to release and should be placed in the non-exempt sectionof the Inmate Central File. This report should be written in non-technicallanguage so that it can be understood by non-professionals.(iii) Other psychiatric, psychological, or evaluative reports preparedby the Bureau of Prisons may also be made available to the Parole Commission.Such reports are to be placed in the Parole Commission and Bureau of PrisonsJoint Use Section of the Inmate Privacy Folder, and a summary of the documentmust be placed in the Inmate Central File. The summary may be placed inthe Progress Report prepared in connection with the inmate's parole hearing.The summary should be sufficiently detailed to permit the inmate to respondto the substance of the withheld information at the Parole Hearing.(iv) With regard to disciplinary records, such as IDC or DHO packets (includingthe IDC/DHO report, Incident Report, notice of hearing, list of inmaterights at IDC/DHO hearing, notice of placement in Administrative Detention,and investigative memoranda), if a portion of an investigation or otherdisciplinary record contains exempt materials, the original IDC/DHO packetshould be maintained together in the Inmate Privacy Folder, but copiesof all disclosable documents must be placed together in the non-exemptsection of the Inmate Central File.(2) If a document originates in another federal agency (including componentsof the Department of Justice but not including federal courts or probationoffices), or has been requested by the Bureau from a source outside thefederal government (e.g., a state agency), it will be placed in the PrivacyFolder. It will be referred to the originating agency for releasabilitysubsequent to a request for records access which includes that document.Unless there is an ongoing need for the document, no copy is retained inthe institution Inmate Central File. The originating agency will be askedto provide a memorandum detailing reasons for non-disclosure if it recommendsagainst disclosure. Bureau staff will review these reasons for compliancewith andSection; 513.32. If non-disclosure is appropriate, staff shall documenttheir rationale for non-disclosure and the document will be placed in thePrivacy Folder. If, prior to request for a document, the Bureau of Prisonsdeems the document to be disclosable, but the agency objects to disclosure,the document will be returned to that agency and no copy will be retainedby the Bureau.(3) Public documents, such as a copy of the Judgment and Commitment, whichoriginate in a federal court or probation office will be placed in thePrivacy Folder. Other documents, such as a court-ordered study preparedby the Bureau, will be referred to the originating or requesting courtupon receipt or preparation by the Bureau for that court's instructionsas to disclosure, unless such instructions have already been received fromthe originating or requesting court. There may be an ongoing need for thedocument while it is being referred for review. Therefore, a copy shouldbe maintained in the Privacy Folder pending decision regarding disclosure.Typical examples of these documents are studies prepared for a court.(4) Unsolicited documents originating outside the federal government willbe reviewed by Bureau staff as to disclosure in accordance with paragraph(a)(1) of this section, and with the provisions on disclosure and neednot be returned to the originator for a disclosure recommendation.(5) Presentence Investigations (PSI)_Pursuant to the Supreme Court decisionin <T3>Julian</T3>, Presentence Reports will be released to an inmate uponthe inmate's request to institution staff. This decision pertains to therelease of federal presentence reports only.(i) Presentence reports prepared December 1, 1975 and later are to be placedin the non-exempt portion of the inmate's central file, and may be releasedto the inmate.(ii) Presentence Reports prepared before December 1, 1975 are to be returnedto the sentencing court, since these reports were prepared with the expectationthat no part of them would be disclosed to the defendant. Unit staff areto review inmate files and return the ``old Presentence Reports'' to thesentencing court, along with a cover letter. The cover letter to the sentencingcourt should indicate that the PSIs are being returned based on the SupremeCourt's decision in <T3>Julian</T3> and the fact that these reports when prepared were notprepared with the expectation of release. No copy of the returned PSI isto be maintained at the institution, although relevant material from thePSI may be incorporated into other documents.(iii) Presentence Reports with ``Do Not Disclose'' Markings_PresentenceReports that have some general stamped marking (e.g., on the face sheetof the Report) of ``Do Not Disclose'' or comparable language will be handledin accordance with paragraphs (a)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section, dependingon when they were prepared.(6) When Bureau of Prisons staff reclassify a document from non-disclosableto disclosable, subsequent to any information request encompassing thatdocument, staff shall place the reclassified document in the non-exemptsection of the Inmate's Central File, and notify the inmate of this reclassificationand of the availability of the document for review.(b) [Reserved]<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 513.34</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Inmate access to central file.</ITAG>An inmate may at any time request to review all disclosable portions ofhis or her Inmate Central File, this includes Judgment and Commitment andeducation files, by submitting a request to a staff member designated bythe Warden. Staff shall acknowledge the request and schedule the inmate,as promptly as is practical, for a review of the file. Prior to the inmate'sreview of the file, staff shall remove the Inmate Privacy Folder whichcontains documents withheld from disclosure pursuant to andSection; 513.32.During the file review, the inmate shall be under direct and constant supervisionby staff. The staff member monitoring the review shall enter the date ofthe inmate's file review on the Work Assignment Sheet and initial the entry.Staff shall also ask the inmate to initial the entry, and if the inmaterefuses to do so, shall enter a notation to that effect. Staff shall advisethe inmate if there are documents withheld from disclosure and, if so,shall advise the inmate of the right to make a formal request for the documentsunder the provisions of andSection; 513.46.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 513.35</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Inmate access to Inmate Central File in connection with parole hearings.</ITAG>An individual inmate may review disclosable portions of the Inmate CentralFile prior to the individual's parole hearing, under the general proceduresset forth in andSection; 513.34, with the following additional requirements:(a) The Bureau ordinarily shall permit this review within seven work daysof a request by an inmate after the inmate has been scheduled for a parolehearing, except that in the case of reports which have been returned (priorto the inmate's request) to originating agencies for clearance, or whichare otherwise not available at the institution, a reasonable extensionof time is permitted.(b) A report received from another agency which is determined to be nondisclosable(see andSection; 513.33 (a)(2)) will be summarized by that agency, in accordancewith Parole Commission regulations. Bureau staff shall place the summaryin the appropriate disclosable section of the Inmate Central File. Theoriginal report (or portion which is summarized in another document) willbe placed in the portion of the Inmate Privacy File for Bureau of Prisonsand Parole Commission Joint Use.(c) With regard to Bureau of Prisons documents, it is anticipated thatpsychiatric or other evaluative reports which are determined nondisclosableto the inmate will be summarized in another document which is disclosableto the inmate (and which is available for review in the disclosable sectionof the Inmate Central File). The document from which the summary is takenwill be placed in the Parole Commission and Bureau of Prisons Joint UseSection of the Inmate Privacy Folder. Nondisclosable documents which arenot summarized for the inmate's use are not available to the Parole Commissionand are placed in a nondisclosable section of the Inmate Central File.(d) When no response as to disclosure has been received from an originatingagency in time for inmate review prior to the hearing, this fact must benoted for the Parole Commission Hearing Examiner.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 513.36</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Inmate access to medical records.</ITAG>(a) Except to the extent otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this andSection;513.36, an inmate may review the following records from his or her medicalfile (including dental records) by submitting a request to a staff memberdesignated by the Warden:(1) Medical and Related Data Sheets (BP-8);(2) Report of Medical History (Standard From 89 or 93);(3) Report of Medical Examination (Standard Form 89);(4) Laboratory Reports which contain only scientific testing results andwhich contain no staff evaluation or opinion (such as Standard Form 514A,Urinalysis).
