The history of artificial rainmaking goes back to 1946 whenVincent Schaefer of the USA discovered the general principles. Duringthe last 40 years cloud seeding activities have stirred the imaginationof scientists all over the world. If this could be carried out in anoperational manner, mankind could have solved the problems of droughtwhich threaten many parts of the globe with famine. However, though alot of progress has been made in cloud physics, an operational rainmakingprogramme is yet far from reality. In some cases seeding increases therainfall whereas in other cases a decrease in rainfall has been noticed.It would be necessary to approach the subject more thoroughly and systematicallyand while making experiments on rainmaking a proper experimental designshould be carried out so that the results of such experiments could beevaluated scientifically.
