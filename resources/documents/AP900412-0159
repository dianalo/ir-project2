(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Apollo astronauts Wally Schirra andBuzz Aldrin lent their support Thursday to a museum auction thataviation buffs hope will do for old airplanes what Sotheby's doesfor Rembrandts and Van Goghs.   ``These planes are works of art in their own right,'' saidDonald Douglas Jr., whose father built the DC-3 and countless otherplanes made famous in war and peace. ``We hope this auction doesvery well by them.''   The auction will be held May 19 and 20 at the grounds of theMuseum of Flying, located where Douglas Sr. once ran his aircraftworks.   Aircraft offered for sale include classic ``war birds'' of WorldWar II vintage _ Spitfires that gained fame in the Battle ofBritain and P-51 Mustangs that escorted American bombers to targetsover Nazi Germany.   Bidding on a P-38 twin-boom Lightning fighter built by Lockheedbegins at $1.1 million in the auction catalog.   A reproduction of a bright red Fokker of the type flown by theRed Baron's squadron during World War I lists for a modest $25,000.   The museum, sitting next to the Santa Monica Airport's runways,is on the site where Army Air Corps planes built by Douglasdeparted in 1924 on a historic round-the-world flight.   One of the biplanes from that flight hangs in the museum.Another is at the Smithsonian Institution's Air andamp; Space Museum inWashington.   Aldrin, whose 1969 moon walk electrified the globe, joinedDouglas and Schirra at the museum preview and joked about space andflight, nicknames and missions in the clouds and beyond.   ``You gave me a bit of boost,'' Schirra quipped to Douglas.   The auction's purpose is to raise funds for the Museum of Flyingand to support scholarships for students who pursue aviationcareers, said David Price, president of the 18-month-old facility.   ``We believe this will be the most historic auction of antiqueaircraft ever,'' said Price. ``It's like mounting a Broadway show.You don't know if it's going to work until opening night.''   A few years after the war, Price noted that a shrewd bargainercould pick up a surplus P-51 Mustang at a country air field for aslittle as $2,000. The same plane now commands a $500,000 pricetag.   A rich history has flamed the passion for planes, Price said.Hundreds of thousands of people attend air shows every year and theAir andamp; Space Museum in Washington is the best attended of all theSmithsonian displays.   ``The fighter planes hark back to chivalry and knighthood,''said Price, who operates golf courses when he isn't flying one ofhis two Spitfires over the Santa Monica Mountains.   Volunteers at the museum in Santa Monica point out with pridethat most of the aircraft on display there can be flown.   ``The kids can smell the gasoline, and they can see that theseairplanes are not relics,'' Price said. ``They are something thatworks.''</TEXT></DOC>
