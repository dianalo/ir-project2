A statement from the U.S. delegation to a week-long conferencethat reviewed the agreement left no doubt that Washington wasdissatisfied with the Kremlin response to U.S. concerns about theKrasnoyarsk radar installation.   The statement said the United States has ``made clear that thecontinuing existence of the Krasnoyarsk radar makes it impossibleto conclude any future arms agreements in the START or defense andspace areas.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administrationwould continue efforts for a treaty on limiting long-range nuclearforces, known as START, but said there was little prospect of doingso before President Reagan leaves office in January.   ``We are still meeting in Geneva and still working toward aSTART treaty ... in the hope that it (the Soviet radar) will bedismantled in the interim,'' he said.   Fitzwater was in Santa Barbara, Calif., with the vacationingpresident.   Negotiations on limiting intercontinental nuclear forces and onspace and defense systems are separate, parallel talks that havecontinued in Geneva since March 1985.   The Soviet Union made no immediate comment but the chief Sovietdelegate, Viktor Karpov, scheduled a news conference for Thursday.The U.S. team was led by the director of the Arms Control andDisarmament Agency, William Burns.   The U.S. statement said that during the review conference, thethird of its kind, ``the Soviet Union gave no indication that itwas prepared to correct the violations (of the ABM treaty) withoutlinking their agreement to do so to unacceptable demands.''   The statement referred to the Krasnoyarsk radar installation,which the United States for years has been saying violates the ABMtreaty because of its location and orientation.   It said the U.S. side also raised the question of two otherradars that the Soviets deployed last year in Gomel, near Kiev.   The ABM treaty limits each side to deploying one ABM systemcomprising a radar and anti-ballistic missiles. It also constrainsearly warning radars which could, because of their location,orientation and capability, contribute to an ABM defense.   The U.S. side charges that the Krasnoyarsk radar is such aninstallation.   ``The Krasnoyarsk violation is very serious, particularly whenit is recognized that the radar constitutes one of a network ofsuch radars that have the inherent potential for attack assessmentin support of ballistic missile defense,'' the statement said.   The aim of the ABM treaty is to prevent either side fromcreating a nationwide protective network, under the theory thatneither side would launch a nuclear attack if there was apossibility of devastating retaliation.   Karpov said in July that the Soviet Union would dismantle theKrasnoyarsk radar equipment, but not the building housing it, ifthe United States agreed to renew its commitment to the ABM treatyfor at least 10 years. But the United States says the entireinstallation must be scrapped.   ``Since the Soviet Union was not prepared to satisfy U.S.concerns'' during the review conference ``the United States willhave to consider declaring this continuing violation a materialbreach of the treaty,'' the statement said.   An information sheet distributed last week by the U.S. missionsays that according to the Vienna Convention on the Law ofTreaties, if one party charges ``material breach'' it is entitledto invoke the breach ``as a ground for terminating the treaty orsuspending its operation in whole or in part.''   Such a move would apparently free the United States to conductuninhibited research and deployment of its proposed space-basedmissile defense system, known officially as the Strategic DefenseInitiative and popularly called ``Star Wars.''   The Soviets say some of the research violates the ABM treaty.They have long said that a limit on the research is a prerequisitefor a START treaty, but the United States has rejected such alinkage.</TEXT></DOC>
