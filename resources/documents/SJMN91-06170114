It is showing up in measurements taken at remote stations spreadbetween Alaska and New Zealand, said F. Sherwood Rowland, a University ofCalifornia, Irvine chemist who leads the team of researchers.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Science andamp; Medicine  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DECLINE FOUND IN BUILDUP OF GREENHOUSE GASMETHANEGOOD NEWS FOR WATCHERS OF GLOBAL WARMING  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Environment  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;The increase in methane is slowing down, and has slowed down quitemarkedly,&quot; Rowland said. Until about 1985, he said, the methane concentrationwas going up rapidly, at a rate of 1 percent per year. Now, the rate hasturned down.;    &quot;Methane is still increasing,&quot; he said, but &quot;the yearlyincrease is somewhat less than it was in the early 1980s.&quot; The annual rate ofincrease then was 18 parts per billion parts of air until 1985. Now, he said,it's about 12 parts per billion. Scientists say methane accumulation isresponsible for 25 percent of any global warming caused by the greenhouseeffect.;    No one knows what is causing the change, Rowland said. Butmeasurements taken by a second team suggest that another chemical, thehydroxyl radical, a reactive molecule made of oxygen and hydrogen, could beeating up the methane.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Newsday  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910618  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  225  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday June 18, 199100170114,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
