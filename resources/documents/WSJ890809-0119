Each recycles its old pet projects as new measures to &quot;strengthen the family.&quot;    Such a seeming convergence of analysis ought to give one pause.    Historically, Americans have become most preoccupied with personal morality and family organization when they have felt overwhelmed by harder issues of public morality and social organization. The first family crisis was discovered in the 1820s, as wage labor undermined an older household economy and post-revolutionary politicians committed themselves to military expansion against Indians and Mexicans. A new family crisis was proclaimed at the turn of the century, when industrialization transformed work patterns, urban segregation worsened, and the country first began to see steadily declining voter turnout. In each case, those who suffered from the changes were accused of bringing the crisis on themselves by their &quot;unfit&quot; personal values or &quot;unworthy&quot; families.    The current family crisis follows a major economic and political restructuring going on since the 1960s: the eclipse of traditional employment centers, destruction of formerly high-paid union jobs, and the mounting dilemmas of welfare capitalism. Now, as in the past, many people fancy that if only the family could be made to function properly, other social issues could be avoided.    Certainly, this restructuring has been accompanied by far-reaching family rearrangements and pressing new problems such as the impoverishment of children. But the extent to which family composition causes such problems has been grossly overestimated. Take the issue of female-headed families, which usually dominates discussion of the fact that one in five U.S. children -- almost one in two black children -- is poor.    To be sure, female-headed families are much more likely to be poor than two-parent families of the same race, both because women earn less than men and because it is increasingly difficult for one wage-earner of either sex to support a family. But how much childhood poverty is caused by family dissolution or could be cured by reviving &quot;traditional&quot; family structures and values? Surprisingly little.    University of Wisconsin researchers Christine Ross and George Slotsve estimate that the poverty rate in 1985 was only 1.3% higher than it would have been without any of the demographic changes since 1967. The University of Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which has followed a representative sample of 5,000 families since 1968, found that only one-seventh of childhood transitions into long-term poverty were associated with family dissolution, while more than half were linked to changes in labor-market participation and remuneration.    A majority of the increase in family poverty since 1979 has occurred in families with both spouses present, with only 38% concentrated in single-parent families, according to Stephen J. Rose in his Pantheon-published reference work on the U.S. economy. In fact, the percentage of the poor living in female-headed families has declined slightly since 1978. Forty percent of America's poor children live in two-parent homes.    Family dissolution, moreover, is often the consequence rather than the cause of the economic reshuffling we are seeing in America. While it is true that complex cultural changes have created a steady rise in divorce and illegitimacy during most of the 20th century (the U.S. has had the highest divorce rate in the world since 1899), people with the lowest educational attainment and greatest vulnerability to poverty have historically had the highest rates of divorce, illegitimacy and child neglect. (Sexual abuse is much more evenly distributed across class lines.) These are the people who have been the big losers since the late 1960s. In 1963, 60% of men aged 20 to 24 earned enough to keep a family of three out of poverty; by 1984 only 42% could do so.    Since 1967 the increased demand for college graduates has been largely at the expense of high school-only graduates. Between 1979 and 1986 the wages of people with a high school education or less declined by 17%, while their numbers grew: from 1979 to 1986 the percentage of young men with at best a high school degree rose to 54% from 50% while the group with a college degree fell to 25% from 27%.    Even families that have survived these pressures intact have avoided poverty only to the extent that they have broken with &quot;traditional&quot; family arrangements. Without the work of wives, the entire bottom 60% of U.S. households would have experienced a loss of real income between 1979 and 1986.    Thus many rearrangements in &quot;traditional&quot; family relations are consequences of deeper structural transformations in the economy and polity. A focus on &quot;family breakdown&quot; may seriously divert us from the research and programs necessary to deal with those changes.    A good example is the attempt by some to explain the deteriorating position of American minorities by their &quot;explosion&quot; of unwed motherhood. The birth rates of unmarried black women have actually declined by 13% since 1970, but because married black women's childbearing rates have dropped much more sharply, by 38%, statistics show an increase in the proportion of total births out of wedlock. Both the plunge in married childbearing and the relative increase in unwed births correlate with a long-term decline in the proportion of black men who can support a family.    The economic marginalization of black men began in the 1950s, as blacks were displaced from agriculture without being absorbed into manufacturing. Since the 1970s, record numbers of competitors for jobs and two back-to-back recessions seem to have pushed young blacks, especially those with little education, ever further behind. Despite the fact that young black college graduates have increased their real earnings since 1973, the average real income for young black men who head families has fallen by 50%, according to the Children's Defense Fund.    University of Chicago sociologist William Julius Wilson estimates that there are only 50 employed black men aged 20 to 24 for every 100 black women in this age group, a fact that does more to explain the high rate of female-headed households in the black community than lamentations about &quot;immoral&quot; subcultures or the supposed &quot;breeding&quot; incentives of welfare.    Black poverty cannot be explained by non-traditional family structure alone. Black children living with two parents have a lower standard of living than white children living with only one parent. Harvard economists David Ellwood and David Wise calculate that family type can explain &quot;at most only two points&quot; in the huge labor-market performance differential between young blacks and whites. &quot;Even if family structures and income for blacks were identical to those of whites, the overall employment rate for black teen-agers living at home would rise only from 21 to 27 percent.&quot; (The corresponding white employment rate, by contrast, is 48%.)    Indeed, &quot;traditional&quot; family values may be part of the problem rather than the solution. Studies show that the men most likely to leave their families when faced with unemployment or income loss tend to subscribe most firmly to the idea of a self-reliant male breadwinner. Families most prone to react to stress with abuse report the strongest approval of male authoritarianism and female passivity.    Similarly, &quot;tradition&quot; provides no answer to teen-age pregnancy, which made its sharpest 20th-century jump during the 1950s, though the problems associated with this were obscured by the falling age of marriage. In 1959, 97 of every 1,000 girls aged 15 to 19 gave birth, compared to 52 of every 1,000 in 1983. Fifties' teens didn't &quot;say no&quot;; they slipped on wedding rings.    The fact that teen-age births increasingly create single mothers today is in many ways due to the persistence of &quot;traditional&quot; values in an economic climate that makes early marriage less viable. Girls who get pregnant in high school are those least likely to report any perception that women can succeed at education or rewarding work; three-fourths of high-school mothers leave school. (High-school dropouts -- not career women -- have the highest divorce rates, while one study shows battered women are eight times more likely than others to have abortions.)    A program to solve current social problems by recreating &quot;traditional&quot; families would involve staggeringly Draconian measures -- and it would almost certainly fail. To establish the family wage system, in which married men supposedly support all mothers and children within self-sufficient families, would require either mandating abortion and birth control for our nation's unmarried women or equipping them with chastity belts, prohibiting divorce except among the rich, obliging unwed mothers to give up their children for adoption, and forcing prospective adoptive couples to accept the black, racially mixed, older white, and disabled children who now cannot find homes. It would also mean prohibiting employers from replacing formerly unionized, male-dominated jobs with cheaper female, foreign or part-time labor.    Poverty derives from class, race and work relations, not family ones. Liberals who avoid confronting this by hitching their wagons to the warm fuzzy of &quot;family protection&quot; are simply ceding initiative to the conservative &quot;pro-family&quot; lobby. Given the unwillingness of that group to support larger reforms, one cannot help but suspect that much of the agitation for &quot;preserving the family&quot; camouflages an agenda for acceleration of economic and political inequality.    ---   Ms. Coontz wrote &quot;The Social Origins of Private Life: A History of American Families&quot; (Verso, 1988). </TEXT></DOC>
