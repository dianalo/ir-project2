SULLIVAN: Colonel North, yesterday when we concluded we hadfocused on the fact that there were four ways that you and theadministration assisted the freedom fighters during the time periodyou spoke about. Now, I'd like to address your attention to theperiod in the summer of 1985. There's been testimony about lettersreceived at the National Security Council directed to Mr. (Robert)McFarlane from Congressman (Michael) Barnes (D-Md.) and Congressman(Lee) Hamilton (D-Ind.). Would you tell the jury what was therelationship that was existing between the Congress and theadministration at that time? ...   NORTH: By the summer of 1985, what had been a long politicalwarfare between the opponents of the president's policy and theadministration was, I guess, made worse by the fact that theCongress voted to approve humanitarian assistance. ... Theadministration countered with accusations of leaks and thatCongress would leak things before they ever happened and peoplealleging that Congress had a unilateral veto, a one man veto overany kind of covert action or anything else, particularly focused onthe Central America problem, and so that even though the Congresshad voted to approve some aid of a nonmilitary nature the opponentsto the administration became even louder in their opposition to theresistance.   SULLIVAN: Now, Congressman Barnes ... was he a strong opponentof aid to the freedom fighters?   NORTH: Yes, sir, he was. ... Congressman Barnes was at that timethe chairman of the Western Hemisphere subcommittee of the HouseForeign Affairs Committee. And that was the subcommittee ... thatvoted on all of the foreign aid for the countries in Latin America.   SULLIVAN: Now ... Congressman Hamilton ... what was his positionin relation to the support for the freedom fighters?   NORTH: Congressman Hamilton (Chairman of the House IntelligenceCommittee) ... was not as vocal as was Congressman Barnes but hewas opposed to military aid to the resistance and he was a strongopponent.   SULLIVAN: So both congressmen, both of whom were against supportfor the freedom fighters, both of whom testified here in court sent... letters in August, 1985....   NORTH: Yes, sir.   SULLIVAN: Now, Colonel, there came a time when you talked to Mr.McFarlane about how the National Security Council should respond tothese inquiries?   NORTH: ... Mr. McFarlane and I had a conversation ... and thatdiscussion focused along the lines of my saying we shouldn't beanswering this, that this kind of information is what is properlythe prerogative of the White House and the president and we oughtto invoke what is called executive privilege. We don't have toanswer this. ... (North read the letter from Rep. Hamiltoninquiring about reported actions taken by the NSC to support theactivities of the Contras despite legislative prohibitions underthe Boland Amendment.)   SULLIVAN: So how did you tell Mr. McFarlane how to respond toCongressman Hamilton's request?   NORTH: What I urged that he do is that he go back and simply saywe're not going to respond to this. That the activities of the NSC... is not a matter for congressional intrusion.   SULLIVAN: What did Mr. McFarlane respond to that?   NORTH: ... He said well, give me a stab or give me a try atanswering this letter. ...   SULLIVAN: Now, when you drafted this (for McFarlane) what wasyour intention?   NORTH: Well, my intention was to continue to try not to give aresponse. ...   SULLIVAN: And (McFarlane took) ... two paragraphs which are theending paragraphs of your draft?   NORTH: Yes, sir.   SULLIVAN: And the rest of the letter was something that he wrote?   NORTH: Yes, sir ... having been told several times that myapproach on this issue was too confrontational ... he didn't wantto hear any more from me about it. ... I took this note along withhis draft ... and went over and made a final memo to go out withthe substantive lengthy answer on this matter.   SULLIVAN: Why?   NORTH: Because the answer that he wanted to give was wrong. Itwas not accurate. It was factually incorrect.   SULLIVAN: And tell the jury again what answer did you want togive?   NORTH: I wanted to give an answer _ my preference right from thestart was to give an answer that would have read something to theeffect, Mr. Hamilton, this is the purview of the presidency. TheConstitution has a separation of powers and the Congress and thepresidency are two coequal branches of government and we don't haveto answer those questions.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
