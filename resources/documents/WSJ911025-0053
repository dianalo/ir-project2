If the treatment, known as a surfactant, proves safe andeffective in clinical trials, it would likely represent anadvance over two similar coatings already marketed forinfants by Burroughs Wellcome Co. and Abbott Laboratories.</LP><TEXT>   Scripps is applying to the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration to begin initial clinical trials with thetreatment. Johnson andamp; Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J., throughits support of Scripps research, would have the first optionto license it.   Surfactant is a thin, lubricant-like film normallyproduced by the body to coat air sacs in the lungs,preventing their collapse. About 37,000 premature infants areborn each year before their lungs are able to make thesubstance, and more than 5,000 of them die. In addition,150,000 adults develop respiratory distress syndrome as aresult of infection, burns, serious injury and otherconditions; about half of them die.   Charles G. Cochrane and Susan Revak, of the immunologydepartment at Scripps, San Diego, said they determined that acertain protein, called surfactant protein B, plays adominant role in strengthening the layer of surfactant, thusimproving its protective capability.   The researchers then chemically synthesized the portion ofthe protein -- a peptide -- responsible for the strengtheningeffect. They incorporated the peptide in a chemically madecoating, and determined in experiments with rabbits andmonkeys that it produced an &quot;excellent surfactant.&quot; Adescription of their work appears today in the journalScience.   &quot;The peptides are simple in their composition andtherefore quite easy to synthesize,&quot; Dr. Cochrane says. &quot;Itwould be possible to make large quantities of the (synthetic)surfactant.&quot;   Exosurf, marketed by Burroughs Wellcome, the U.S. unit ofWellcome PLC, Britain, is also a synthetic surfactant, butdoesn't include surfactant protein B. Abbott, of Abbott Park,Ill., sells Survanta, a product made from cow lungs.   T. Allen Merritt, professor of pediatrics and director ofneonatology at the University of California Davis MedicalCenter, Sacramento, described the Scripps material as a&quot;second generation&quot; surfactant because surfactant protein Bis one of its components.   Both Exosurf and Survanta have received FDA approval foruse on premature infants and have proved effective inreducing deaths from respiratory distress syndrome around theworld. Clinical trials are under way to determine theireffectiveness in adults, Dr. Merritt says. &quot;New generationsof surfactant will undoubtably improve overall efficacy ofthis therapy,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
