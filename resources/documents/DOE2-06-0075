Exposure of endothelial cell cultures to ozone produceda concentration dependent decreases in the synthesis of PGl{sub 2}. Releaseof {sup 3}H-arachidonic acid from endothelial cells was increased aftertwo hours of 0.3 and 1.0 ppm O{sub 3} exposure while incubation of cellswith 20 {mu}M and arachidonate (4 min) after exposure resulted in a decreasedPGl{sub 2} synthesis. Cells exposed to 1.0 ppm O{sub 3} did not havea decreased PGl{sub 2} production when incubated with 5 {mu}M PGH{sub2} immediately after exposure. These results are consistent with an O{sub3}-induced inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity. O{sub 3} exposure (1.0ppm) produced a rapid decrease in endothelial PGl{sub 2} synthesis. Thedata suggest that cyclooxygenase was not inactivated by increased autooxidationdue to metabolism of increased free arachidonate. PGl{sub 2} synthesisreturned to control amounts within 12 hours after ozone exposure similarto the recovery time of irreversibly inhibited cyclooxygenase suggestingthat recovery was due to de novo synthesis of enzyme. Lipid peroxidesand/or hydrogen peroxide (H{sub 2}O{sub 2}) may have caused the inhibitionof cyclooxygenase. Incubation of cells with catalase (5 U/ml) protectedagainst the O{sub 3}-induced depression in PGl{sub 2} synthesis. Exogenouslyadded H{sub 2}O{sub 2} ({ge} 75 {mu}M) caused a stimulation of basalPGl{sub 2} production but depressed arachidonate-stimulated synthesis.O{sub 3} exposure (2 hr, 1.0 ppm) produced altered metabolism of arachidonatein other important lung cell types, e.g., a decreased PGl{sub 2} synthesisin smooth muscle cultures. Exposure of lung macrophages to O{sub 3} causedan increase in almost all arachidonate metabolites produced.</TEXT></DOC>
