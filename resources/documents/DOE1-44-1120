Throughout the directory, recyclers are remindedto check with buyers regarding current-delivery schedules, requirementsfor material preparation and shipping, and to determine if buyers areactually purchasing the type of materials that you have to sell. In summary,this is a detailed guide to who is buying what and how they want it processed.But since market conditions and buying policies change, recyclers arecautioned to always contact buyers before shipping.
