Particular attention is givento dusty plasma and the plasma space (filamentary currents, surface currentsgiving space a cellular structure, double layers, the pinch effect, circuits,and the critical velocity). It is concluded that space data from astronomicaltelescopes should be treated by scientists who are familiar with laboratoryand magnetospheric physics, circuit theory, and modern plasma physics.28 references.</TEXT></DOC>
