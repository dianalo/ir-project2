Skip the labels and conclusions, the late North Carolina Democrat advised the staff of his Senate Watergate Committee. &quot;Just draw the horse,&quot; he said, &quot;and know that any damn fool looking at it will see that it is a horse.&quot;    A year after the first disclosures of the Iran-Contra affair, House and Senate committees face the same challenge as they put the finishing touches on their final picture of the controversy. The massive report, to be released with much fanfare in about 10 days, is the product of three months of closed committee negotiations and editing and of the tugs and pulls of political and personal loyalties.    It won't tell the entire story, and it won't fully answer some of the most important questions arising from the Iran-Contra affair. But &quot;the hearings had a lot of important facts,&quot; says Senate Counsel Arthur Liman. &quot;There is a need to synthesize. . . . You should extract the meaning.&quot;    House Republicans bolted in August to begin preparing their lengthy dissent -- even before a majority of the 26 committee members had finished a first draft. Three of the five Senate Republicans joined 15 House and Senate Democrats in approving the report yesterday, but their presence inevitably muffles criticism of President Reagan.    Sen. Warren Rudman, vice chairman of the Senate committee, for example, portrays the president as more &quot;the victim&quot; than the cause of the covert dealings around him. &quot;The president was used by his staff,&quot; says the New Hampshire Republican. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Dante Fascell, a Florida Democrat, answers sarcastically: &quot;Of course, he's the victim. He's the president. He has no choice.&quot;    Politics accounts for only part of the friction. Choosing words has forced judgments of style and values. &quot;Cover-Up&quot; was rejected as a chapter title, for example, in part because it echoes of scandals past. &quot;Taken to the Cleaners,&quot; a snippet of Secretary of State George Shultz's testimony, might yet survive.    Filling hundreds of pages, the report is the most complete record yet of covert arms-for-hostage deals with Iran and a secret operation run from the White House to assist Nicaraguan insurgents during a two-year ban on U.S. military aid. Its center of gravity is a great body of facts already known, but writing the report has put the puzzle in clearer focus. Pieces fall into place. Details are added from sources never fully aired before.    The authors tap private interviews with hundreds of witnesses and previously classified depositions, including those of Central Intelligence Agency officials and participants in a private fund-raising network on behalf of the Contras. Financial data and a chronology provided by Israel fill some gaps in Jerusalem's role in the early arms sales and contacts with the White House.    Most important are the notebooks Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North kept of his activities, and transcripts of secret U.S. tapes recording the flamboyant claims made by White House and Iranian representatives in clandestine meetings.    The evidence shows the diversion of funds to the Contras was anticipated well before President Reagan authorized direct U.S. arms sales to Iran. And it pictures a tightly compartmentalized National Security Council staff moving purposely forward, circumventing any internal opposition. Col. North's notebooks add information about his circle of associates in the administration, particularly in the Justice Department and the Customs Service.    The tapes, meanwhile, provide new insight into the negotiations with Iran. Instead of being bit players in the drama, the Dawa prisoners held by Kuwait take on a greater role as Iranian middlemen seek their freedom on behalf of Iran's Lebanese Shiite allies who, in turn, are holding American hostages. &quot;There are some eurekas,&quot; says an investigator.    There also have been arguments. Staff lawyers recruited from private firms for the investigation want a report that meets the same standards as a lawyer's statement of facts to a judge in a post-trial brief. Attorneys assigned from congressional committees see a grittier role for themselves: They want the report to say something about the president's use of power -- and public resources -- to circumvent the ban on Contra aid. &quot;I want it to have oomph,&quot; says a House aide.    Sen. Ervin had oomph. When compared with the Iran-Contra panels, he also had it easy. A young Sen. Howard Baker -- now the White House chief of staff -- tried to hold up that report, but he couldn't argue with tapes of Richard Nixon's most intimate conversations. The Iran-Contra affair is messier, less decisive. Witnesses are missing, and secrets scattered abroad, like the bank records of shell corporations that ran arms to the Contras. Death silenced William Casey, director of the Central Intelligence Agency and one of Col. North's mentors. Willard Zucker, the American-born Geneva attorney, escaped subpoenas by staying in Switzerland and so has never explained his part in masterminding the money maze.    From the outset, the committees have operated under a politically imposed deadline requiring them to complete their work by this fall. Witnesses were called before relevant documents could be fully reviewed in some cases, and the admitted destruction of White House papers leaves major gaps. The result is that much work remains in the hands of Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh, who only this week received relevant Swiss bank records for his criminal inquiry.    The committees' unwieldy size -- two staffs serving the two houses of Congress -- makes their assignment more difficult. House committee Chairman Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.) estimates the executive summary has passed through more than 40 drafts. &quot;Too many hands writing,&quot; complains Sen. William Cohen. As an example, the Maine Republican points to some &quot;florid prose,&quot; citing &quot;In Satan's Parlor,&quot; a since-deleted section heading. He first blames the House, then remembers it was the Senate panel's staff that wrote it.    After the public drama of the televised hearings last summer, the writing of the report is a journey inward. Investigators who could cleverly dissect witnesses seem to lose their bearings and give widely different accounts of an exercise in which they are part. There is a recognition that printed words can't recapture the power of the hearings.    But those who do the writing speak of their audience in terms of the future. Some say they write for the &quot;press,&quot; using the report to air facts to be followed up by reporters when the committees disband. Others envision high-school students reading a lesson in history a decade from now.    &quot;It will be a footnote,&quot; says Chairman Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii) of the Senate committee. Sen. Rudman, the vice chairman, even as he defends Mr. Reagan, would make the report required reading for the next man in the Oval Office. &quot;I think we're writing for future presidents,&quot; he says. &quot;This event is a model of what should not have been allowed to happen.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
