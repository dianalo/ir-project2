A spokesman for Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. said ChairmanKenko Hasegawa and the chairmen of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. received official invitations fromBoeing to join in the design, production and sale of the new 767X.   The wide-body, designed for fuel efficiency and quietperformance, would be Seattle-based Boeing's entry in the300-passenger jetliner class.   The European joint venture Airbus Industrie and McDonnellDouglas of the United States now dominate that market.   The three Japanese firms long have had close ties with Boeingand now act as subcontractors for the Boeing 737, 747 and 757series of jets. Boeing's new proposal would enable the Japanese toparticipate in all aspects of the plane's production and marketing.   ``It will allow us to learn both the hard and soft aspects (ofthe airplane industry) from a top-level firm,'' said a Mitsubishiofficial, speaking on condition of anonymity.   So far, Japanese firms have been minor players in the worldaircraft market, producing just one civilian airliner entirelydesigned and manufactured in Japan _ the YS-11, a turboprop planefor 60 passengers.   The 767X project also might compete for time and resources witha Japanese government-sponsored program to produce a small,energy-efficient plane, the companies say.   They said they will consider Boeing's offer only after extensivestudies of the feasibility of the 767X.   Dick Schleh of Boeing said the 767X has been under considerationfor more than a year and discussions with Fuji, Kawasaki andMitsubishi have been going on for three months or more.   So far, there has been no decision on whether to proceed withthe 767X, Schleh said.   Japan also produces, but does not export, military planes,mostly under license from U.S. manufacturers.   It has agreed with the United States on joint development ofJapan's next generation jet fighter, the FSX. Critics in the UnitedStates say the $6 billion project amounts to a giveaway of U.S.technology that Japan could use to become competitive in thecivilian aircraft market.   Defenders of the arrangement note that Japan originally wantedto develop the fighter on its own, and say there will be a mutuallybeneficial exchange of technology. They say the project isimportant to U.S.-Japan defense ties, and will provide about $2.5billion worth of work for American companies.   The new plane is to be based on General Dynamics Corp.'s F-16.   The weekly Japan Economic Journal said this week that the 767X'stotal development cost is estimated at $4 billion, and the threeJapanese firms are expected to bear about 20 percent of that.   The first jetliner in Boeing's 767 series began service inSeptember 1982. The largest version, the 767-300, has 261 seats, arange of 4,100 miles and a cost of $75 million to $80 million.   Boeing's largest plane, the 747-400, can seat as many as 509passengers.</TEXT></DOC>
