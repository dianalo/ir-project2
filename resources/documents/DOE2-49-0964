This technique dependson the fact that many marine carbonate components and diagenetic mineralsdisplay a uniform or growth-zoned fluorescence without having been stainedby fluorescent dyes. Although the causes of carbonate fluorescence arenot well understood, several possible activators can be identified. Byanalogy with other fluorescent minerals such as willemite, carbonatefluorescence may be controlled by the presence of trace elements. Ithas been suggested by other workers that carbonate fluorescence can becaused by organic matter. This hypothesis is supported by observationsof dolomites form the A-1 Carbonate of Michigan that fluoresce brightlybut do not luminesce. In addition, low-magnesium calcites grown in solutionsspiked with fluorescent dyes such as acridine orange and fluoresceindisplay uniform fluorescent growth-bands. These crystals contain no visibleinclusions of the parent fluid or organic contaminants. Their fluorescenceis therefore suggested to reflect the presence of organic dye incorporatedon a submicroscopic level.</TEXT></DOC>
