(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Data center managers who have invested in uninterruptible power supplies asinsurance against power failures and system down-time are making anunsettling discovery: uninterruptible power supplies don't guaranteeuninterrupted power.andM;That's because the electrical infrastructure around IBM and compatiblemainframes, and other systems lke standard Digital VAXs, includes a potentialsingle point of failure that UPSs were never intended to fix.andP;  Standard UPSstypically take in power from two or more sources.andP;  If there's an interruptionin power from the local utility, the UPS can switch automatically to asecondary source--battery or generator power--without missing a beat.andM;The problem is that, while UPSs are typically fed by redundant power sources,they usually deliver power to computers via a single wire or cable.andP;  If acircuit breaker, plug, transformer or distribution panel along that isolatedlink fails, a multimillion-dollar mainframe or a disk drive containingcritical data can be lost for minutes or hours.andM;The Grief DownstreamandM;It's impossible to say how often failures occur downstream from the UPS.andP;  Butthey do happen.andP;  Ken Brill, a Danvers, Mass., data center consultant,recently asked a roomful of data center managers how many had everexperienced a power failure because an electrician opened the wrong circuitbreaker, a circuit breaker failed or someone mistakenly hit the system'semergency off switch.andP;  &quot;Every hand in the room went up,&quot; says Brill.andM;About 150 IS managers discussed the issue at a recent meeting of the New YorkCity-based Uninterruptible Uptime Users Group (UUUG).andP;  Several members arenow assembling an informal consortium of user organizations to pressurecomputer vendors into correcting what they see as a serious problem.andM;Brill, who is one of the driving forces behind the effort, says the solutionis embarassingly simple.andP;  All computer vendors such as IBM need to do isintegrate dual power cords, dual power distribution units and the necessaryswitches into their mainframe CPUs, storage devices and controllers.andP;  Thenusers would have a way to provide fully redundant power to the entire system.andO;If there were an interruption anywhere in the power delivery system, powerwould still be available from a second source.andM;IBM currently provides dual power cords with manual switching only on somedisk controller and communication controller products.andP;  But it does not do soon its mainframe CPUs or on the disk devices themselves.andP;  Neither doIBM-compatible mainframe vendors Amdahl Corp. or Hitachi Data Systems Corp.andO;Digital Equipment Corp. recently began shipping a fault-tolerant version ofits VAX CPUs with dual power support.andP;  Digital still doesn't support dualpower on its disk storage subsystems, however.andM;Mainframe vendors say they're aware that a number of large user organizationsare pushing for dual power support on mainframe processors and disks.andP;  Butthey've hesitated to engineer the support into their products because, theysay, it would add $100,000 or more to the cost of a mainframe.andP;  They say theyaren't sure how many organizations would be willing to pay that kind of moneyto protect themselves against what vendors see as a relatively unlikelyfailure.andM;&quot;It's a good enough idea that we've already got a couple of products that doit [support dual power],&quot; says Tom Enger, an IBM engineer and Big Blue'srepresentative to the UUUG.andP;  &quot;The question is how many people would actuallyimplement it if it were available on mre products?&quot;andM;A growing number of user organizations answer that they're out to eliminateany and all potential failures and are willing to pay the price.andP;  So criticalis 100% mainframe availability to American Express Co., for example, thatwhen the credit card company built a new data center a few years ago for itsTravel Related Services business, it created two completely redundantelectrical systems, fed off separate power grids, supporting six redundantIBM 3090 mainframes and mirrored disks.andM;According to John Jackson, formerly a facilities-engineering manager at AmEx,the power setup includes a number of custom switches both upstream anddownstream from the UPS that can automatically begin drawing power from asecond line in case of a failure.andP;  The redundant power and advanced-switchingcapabilities also give AmEx flexibility in moving and maintaining data centerequipment.andP;  AmEx officials won't discuss the cost of the Phoenix datacenter's power redundancy, but Jackson figures it, and other backup measures,doubled the cost of building the electrical system.andM;Most organizations aren't prepared to go to that kind of expense to spreadredundant power throughout their data centers.andP;  Still, many would welcome asimple, off-the-shelf solution to dual-sourced power from IBM and othervendors.andP;  Without it, some say, their systems and even their businesses arein jeopardy.andM;Allan Klein, a senior consultant in St. Paul, Minn., with Fort Worth-basedBurlington Northern Railroad Co., has reason to feel concerned.andP;  &quot;Our traincontrol system monitors 20,000 miles of track and, at any given moment, over100,000 cars,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;There is no manual mode of operation.andP;  Without thesystem, we are out of business.&quot;andM;About a year ago, Burlington Northern conducted a comprehensive inventory ofits information systems infrastructure.andP;  It found several problems.andP;  Amongother things, the company discovered that, although it had invested in UPSs,its computer systems were still vulnerable because they could not acceptdual-sourced power.andP;  &quot;We started asking [computer] vendors why theirequipment didn't have dual power cords.andP;  That's the obvious first step,&quot; saysKlein, who is working with Brill to pressure vendors to provide dual-sourcedpower.andM;A Balance Of PowerandM;Getting IBM and other vendors to design equipment to accept dual-sourcedpower is only a first step, however, Brill and others stress.andP;  Fordual-sourced power to be maximally effective, IS and facilities managers mustfirst make an inventory of the power sources available to their data center.andO;Optimally, the computers should be connected by dual power paths to redundantdistribution panels, transformers and related equipment on up to redundantUPSs attached to separate grids.andP;  In the worst f cases, it does no good toprovide dual power paths to computer equipment if all of the power ultimatelyis coming from the same utility power grid.andP;  Organizations such as AmericanExpress have worked with utilities to make sure that dual power originatesfrom different grids.andM;&quot;What we're talking about here is a whole new thought process,&quot; says Brill.andO;&quot;Not only are the vendors going to have to cooperate but IS is going to haveto expand its thinking beyond the data center and start working more closelywith facilities engineers.&quot;andM;Vendors, meanwhile, are concerned not only about how many user organizationswould buy into the idea but about the possibility that dual-sourced powercould threaten other revenue streams.andM;Vendors like Amdahl and IBM benefit today by selling subsystems that cansolve a piece of the vulnerability problem brought on by single-sourcedpower.andP;  These subsystems include mirrored disks, redundant processors andfiberoptic cabling such as IBM's Enterprise Systems Connection Architecture(ESCON), which permits peripherals to connect to mainframes over longdistances.andP;  Mainframe vendors may be reluctant to cut into those saleswithout a strong indication that customer demand for dual-sourced power willbring in comparable revenue.andM;&quot;It [providing dual-sourced power] is something that's worth exploring,&quot; saysMike Orr, an IBM engineer.andP;  &quot;But it's kind of a chicken-and-egg situation.andO;The question is whether there are people out there willing to buy it.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
