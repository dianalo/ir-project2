The law providesthat the standards will be voluntary for new non-Federal buildings, butwill be mandatory for new Federal buildings. Today, after due consideration of public comment, DOE is promulgating interimenergy conservation mandatory performance standards for new Federal residentialbuildings. The interim standards require a Federal agency to establishan energy consumption goal for the design of a new Federal residentialbuilding using the computerized calculation procedure provided in a designatedFederal micro-computer program and to adopt such procedures as may be necessaryto assure that the design of a new Federal residential building is notless energy conserving than the energy consumption goal established forthe design.The interim standards were designed specifically to accommodate the typesof Federal construction most commonly built, Federal economic parameters,and Federal procurement procedures. The Department is in the process ofdeveloping energy conservation voluntary standards, that would be moreapplicable to the non-Federal residential and commercial sectors to beissued at a future date. The Department recognizes that the standards establishedtoday could be modified for other than Federal use. It cautions any personor entity that wishes to do so. The Department does not recommend use ofthe interim standards for non-Federal sector application without a substantialreview of the interim standards for applicability to the particular use.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>February 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2> <ITAG tagnum="15">Stephen P.

The interim standards require Federal agencies to designnew Federal residential buildings in accordance with the energy conservationrequirements of andSection; 435.303 of the interim standards. The interimstandards do not regulate non-Federal construction. The interim standardshave been developed specifically for Federal agencies that construct residentialbuildings. The calculation procedures used to apply the interim standardsto Federal residential construction are not intended for use by the non-Federalsector. DOE intends to develop and promulgate a more appropriate formatfor voluntary interim energy conservation performance standards for usein the private sector at some future date. Prior to the promulgation of the interim standards, DOE published, on August20, 1986, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) (51 FR 29754) in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The NOPR announced DOE's intention to promulgateinterim mandatory standards for new Federal residential buildings and providedfor a ninety day public comment period and three public hearings. In asubsequent Notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, on November 19, 1986, (51 FR 41637), DOE extendedthe comment period by fifty-nine days. The comment period closed on January16, 1987. In response to public comment and with the availability of additional technicalinformation, DOE made revisions to the proposed interim standards and themicro-computer program, and its supporting documentation. Several commentswere received concerning the lack of energy conservation credits for thermalmass options within the proposed interim standards. DOE concurs with thosewho provided the comments and is in the process of preparing modificationsto the computer program that will accurately reflect the energy conservationbenefits of thermal mass. An alternate compliance procedure and new windowglazing energy data are also being developed as modifications to the computerprogram. It is intended that the proposed modifications will be publishedin a Notice of Proposed Modification to the Final Interim Rule in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>to allow the public an opportunity to comment.The interim standards, promulgated today, will remain in effect until DOEpromulgates final standards. By law, DOE is required to conduct a demonstrationof the interim standards, based on criteria established by the Act, andreport its findings to the Congress, prior to the development and promulgationof final standards.<ITAG tagnum="26">I.

Background </ITAG>Originally enacted on August 14, 1976 as Title III of the Energy Conservationand Production Act, Pub. L. 94-385, 90 Stat. 1144 <T3>et seq., </T3>42 U.S.C. 6831, the Act required the Department of Housingand Urban Development (HUD) to develop, promulgate, implement and enforcecompliance with performance standards to improve the energy efficiencyof all new buildings in the nation. On August 4, 1977, the Act was amendedby Section 304(a), 42 U.S.C. 7154, of the Department of Energy OrganizationAct, Pub. L. 95-91, 91 Stat. 565 <T3>et seq., </T3>which transferred from HUD to DOE the responsibilityto develop and promulgate the standards. The amendments to the Act didnot change HUD's implementation responsibilities. In November 1979, DOE published proposed performance standards in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>44 FR 68120 (November 28, 1979). The noticewas controversial and generated over 1,800 comments totalling 40,000 pages.The comments included technical and other substantive criticisms of theperformance standards. Less than a year after the publication of the proposed standards, the Actwas again amended. Section 326, 94 Stat. 1649, of the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-399 (October 8, 1980) required thatDOE promulgate interim standards by August 1, 1981 and extended the promulgationdate of the final standards to April 1, 1983. The interim standards wereonly to apply to new Federal buildings. In addition, the Act required demonstrationprojects to be conducted in at least two geographical areas. In August 1981, Congress again amended the Act. Subtitle D of Title 10of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub. L. 97-35, 95 Stat. 621,amended the Act to create the term ``voluntary performance standards'',eliminated the provision for a possible statutory sanction for noncompliance,added a provision that, except for Federal buildings, ``voluntary standardswill be developed solely as guidelines to provide technical assistancefor the design and construction of energy efficient buildings'', and extendedthe deadline for DOE to furnish reports on the demonstration projects toCongress. The legislative changes that have taken place since the original 1976 enactmentrequired DOE to make fundamental changes to the compliance aspects of theStandard regulatory approach which Congress had earlier directed the Departmentto take. DOE retains the responsibility for developing performance standardsto achieve the maximum practicable improvements in energy efficiency anduse of non-depletable resources for all new buildings. However, these standardsnow serve a dual purpose. The performance standards serve one purpose forthe Federal sector where the standards prescribe mandatory design requirements.For non-Federal buildings, voluntary performance standards serve only asguidelines for the purpose of providing technical assistance for the designand construction of energy efficient buildings. Accordingly, the performancestandards serve a second purpose of providing sound technical informationand examples of efficient design practices for voluntary use in the privatesector. On August 20, 1986, the Department published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(51 FR 29754) proposed interim mandatory energyconservation performance standards for new Federal residential buildings.These proposed standards were the first of three proposed interim standards.The others are voluntary energy conservation performance standards fornew commercial and multi- family high rise residential buildings and voluntaryenergy conservation performance standards for new non-Federal residentialbuildings. On September 23, 1986, DOE published an addendum to the proposedstandards to correct data in the Technical Support Document issued concurrentlywith the NOPR. On November 19, 1986, a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice was published announcing an extensionof the public comment period by fifty- nine days. Public comments wereanalyzed and revisions were made culminating in today's rulemaking. OnMay 8, 1987, the Department published proposed voluntary interim energyconservation performance standards for commercial and multi- family highrise buildings in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 17052). The Department also intends to publish voluntary interim standards fornew non-Federal sector residential housing sometime in the future. DOEis currently working with the American Society of Heating, Refrigeratingand Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE) on a research project thatwould culminate in recommendations being made to both organizations onnew residential building standards. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of the Interim Standards </ITAG>A. Description of the Interim Standards As the Act requires, the interim standards for new residential buildingswere developed to enable Federal agencies to design residential buildingswhich are cost-effective to build and operate. Pursuant to the Act theywere intended to serve two purposes: (1) To be used as a mandatory standardfor all Federal agencies that design and construct residential buildings,and (2) to be able to serve as a voluntary guideline to the nation's builders.In order to meet these criteria, the useability of the interim standardswas considered a very high project priority. The interim standards are expressed in terms of this objective: each Federalresidential building should be designed to include the combination of energyconservation measures that represents the practicable optimum life cycleenergy cost to the Federal government in a particular location. This isachieved by requiring that Federal officials use local construction, maintenanceand replacement costs, local climate data, and local fuel costs as inputsto a micro-computer program that will automatically construct an energy-efficientand cost-effective energy consumption goal for any of nine building unittypes. The most novel aspect of the interim standards, which distinguishes itfrom other standards, is that location-specific requirements can be generatedby the use of software and micro-computer technology. The use of micro-computertechnology was chosen partly on the basis of the emergence of the technologyover the period of the last few years and partly because of the ease inwhich energy and cost calculations are made. The use of micro-computershas become common among Federal agencies, and advantages in time savingsclearly justify the technology for use with building standards. Use ofmicro-computers eliminates the need for anyone to perform lengthy calculationsor make uninformed choices regarding the optimization of energy conservationmeasures. Research has shown that in the majority of cases, the optimizationof energy conservation measures cannot be derived from professional judgementalone, and the amount of time it takes to perform adequate analysis hasbeen a deterrent to the advancement of energy-conserving residential buildingdesign in the U.S. The need to perform analyses that continually tradeoff energy conservation measures is required to produce cost-effectivebuilding designs. The interim standards mandate the use of a DOE-sponsored micro-computerprogram called COSTSAFR (<T3>C</T3>onservation <T3>O</T3>ptimization <T3>S</T3>tandard for <T3>S</T3>avings in <T3>F</T3>ederal <T3>R</T3>esidences) that was developed to make the selection of optimalenergy conservation measures and, consequently, the design of cost-effectiveenergy-efficient buildings a relatively simple process. One output fromthe COSTSAFR program is the data to be used in determining compliance withthe interim standards. COSTSAFR is designed to provide specific informationon the interaction of up to 30 energy conservation measures in nearly anyU.S. location. It will enable the Federal government to develop cost-effectiveresidential building standards for a single project, thus reducing themore general nature of previous standards. Finally, it is designed to beeffective for any of several building types including single-family, smallmultifamily, and manufactured housing. Before developing a compliance tool, DOE reviewed the design and constructionprocedures currently used by the military as well as other Federal agenciesresponsible for residential construction. The military is responsible forin excess of 95% of the Federal government's housing construction. DOEconcluded that what was necessary was a simplified tool that could displayenergy conservation options in terms of dollars saved to the government.In addition, this tool had to be available early in the design and constructionprocess to preserve designer flexibility. COSTSAFR has been designed so that implementing officials, designers, andbuilders can easily tell if a proposed combination of measures will resultin energy conservation levels that meet or exceed an optimized level forcost-effective energy conservation in a building. The COSTSAFR program performs life cycle cost optimization for a broadset of energy conservation measures and determines the energy costs forthe resulting optimum set of measures. The result is a total point valuefor the energy conservation measures to be installed in the optimal house.COSTSAFR then prints out a point system for all energy conservation optionsindicating how various levels of each option perform relative to the optimumoption. This point system is the compliance tool provided to bidders whocan then select measures as they choose and know whether their combinationof energy conservation measures has met or exceeded the optimum levelsrequired by the interim standards. Procedurally, to comply, a Federal procurement official will have to obtaina copy of the COSTSAFR software, its accompanying User's Manual and haveaccess to a micro-computer system which runs on the MS-DOS disk operatingsystem. COSTSAFR will be made available through the Department of Commerce'sNational Technical Information Service. The software and the User's Manualwill lead the user through the steps of selecting a building prototype,location and fuel type; selecting the set of energy conservation measuresthat are to be considered; calculating the life cycle cost minimum forthe prototypical building; and finally, calculating the points correspondingto alternative energy conservation options and printing them out in a setof compliance forms. The builder using the compliance forms must show thatthe intended design is equivalent to or more efficient than its correspondingprototypical design with its optimized set of energy conservation measures.The COSTSAFR program will be made available to all Federal agencies procuringresidential buildings. B. Section-by-Section Analysis of the Interim Standards The following paragraphs discuss, section by section, the interim standards:(Please note that the numbering system for the interim standards has beenchanged from the system used in the proposed interim standards.) Section 435.300 Purpose. (formerly Section 435.300) This section restates the purpose of the interim standards to be used byFederal agencies in the design and construction of new residential buildings.Section 435.301 Scope. (formerly Section 435.31) Under the scope of the interim standards, new residential buildings includeall new buildings for Federal residential occupancy in the ContinentalU.S., Alaska and Hawaii, except a multi-family building more than threestories above grade, after the effective date of this rule. Section 435.302 Definitions. (formerly Section 435.32) This section defines terms that are used throughout this subpart. Definitionsof the technical terms used in this subpart or in any of the supportingdocumentation are standard def initions used by the national standardssetting organizations. Section 435.303 Requirements for the Design of a Federal Residential Building.(formerly Section 435.33) This section identifies the interim standards and the requirements forcompliance. The interim standards are expressed in the terms of an energygoal or objective which is unique to each building. The goal for Federalofficials and their building designers is to produce a building that containsthe maximum practicable improvements in energy efficiency for their intendedbuildings. Section 435.304 The COSTSAFR Program. (formerly Section 435.34) The COSTSAFR micro-computer program is the source for developing the totalpoint score that serves as the energy consumption goal for the design ofnew Federal residential buildings. The basis for the point score is thepracticable optimum life cycle cost of the most effective energy conservationmeasuresfor a given building type and climate location. Once a housing type hasbeen selected and the appropriate fuel price forecasts identified, theresponsible Federal official is free to use local fuel costs, local construction,maintenance and operation costs, and to select climate data appropriatefor the construction location. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Summary of Public Comment on the August 20, 1986 NOPR and DOEResponses </ITAG>The following is a summary of the public comments received by DOE on the<T3>Proposed Interim Energy Conservation Standards for New Federal ResidentialBuildings</T3> published in the August 20, 1986, <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Comments were received from August 20, 1986,through January 16, 1987. The DOE held three public hearings, one eachin San Francisco, California, Chicago, Illinois, and Washington, DC, anda total of 202 written comments and oral testimony were received. Approximately 42% of the comments came from firms and organizations relatedto the production and sale of concrete and masonry products; 33% from builders,material supply organizations, government agencies, research organizations,and trade associations; and about 25% from electric power utilities. Theircomments were reviewed by DOE officials and are discussed below. A. General Comments Overall, the public comment received was generally favorable to the useof a computer program as a compliance tool for Federal residential standards.In fact, no comments were received relative to andSection; andSection;  435.300- 435.304, which detail the requirements of the interim standards. Allof the comments received pertained to the COSTSAFR micro-computer program,its User's Manual, and the COSTSAFR Technical Support Documents. Some whocommented indicated that COSTSAFR, in its proposed form, appeared to becomplicated to use, unclear, inadequately documented, incapable of beingverified through some alternate means, and biased against the masonry andconcrete industries because no energy conservation credit is given formassive wall construction. In addition, some expressed concern that COSTSAFRwas based upon a methodology which they believe promotes the selectionof certain fuels, appliances, or construction techniques while penalizingothers. DOE was asked to consider delaying or re-proposing the interim standardsuntil the issues with COSTSAFR and thermal mass could be resolved. A small number of commenters argued that the COSTSAFR program also discriminatesagainst small business and contractors which do not have access to micro-computersor the knowledge to run the program. They expressed concern that they wouldbe required to hire a computer professional to obtain data from the program.This they indicated would raise their overheads and jeopardize their abilityto compete. <T3>DOE Response:</T3>As noted above, the DOE issued an Addendum to the COSTSAFR Technical SupportDocuments on September 23, 1986, to correct some errors that were the causeof confusion and concern to the public. Also, the User's Manual and pointsystem have been improved to increase clarity and reduce confusion. Inaddition, DOE has decided to issue a modification to COSTSAFR which willprovide for an alternate compliance method as well as integrate thermalmass algorithms and new window data into the COSTSAFR program. DOE believesthat the modifications will alleviate and dispel the concerns and confusionvoiced by those who commented on these issues. The use of COSTSAFR should place minimal burdens on small business andcontractors since only the Federal agencies need the capability to runthe micro-computer software. DOE will conduct a demonstration program designedto identify if and what effects the interim standards have on small business,contractors, and others. B. Specific Comments <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Time Extension Comments </ITAG>Approximately 40% of all who commented indicated the need for additionaltime to prepare for public hearings and/or submit written comments. Manyargued that the COSTSAFR computer program and User's Manual lacked sufficientinformation to permit a complete analysis. Additional information frequentlyrequested included: a description of the optimum building prototype onwhich the COSTSAFR computer program is based; an explanation of the pointsassigned to the energy conservation options; examples of compliance printouts;sufficient computer program documentation; and, the sources of informationfor appliance energy efficiency labels, area cost multipliers and HVACequipment constants used in COSTSAFR. Others requesting time extensions indicated their limited resources andexpertise in analyzing computer programs and computer programming languages.Many found it difficult and time consuming to obtain and install the 8087math co-processor in time to prepare comments by the end of the officialpublic comment period. A 90-day extension was the time frame most oftenrequested by those who commented. <T3>DOE Response:</T3>DOE issued a time extension to the comment period on November 19, 1986,extending the comment period by fifty-nine days. This extended the commentperiod from its previous closing date of November 18, 1986, to January16, 1987. In addition, DOE provided reviewers with additional mathematicaldocumentation of the COSTSAFR computer program and an example of a completedcompliance form. The time extension was provided because DOE recognizedearly in the original comment period that additional time would increasethe number of beneficial comments. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Objections to Private Sector Use Comments </ITAG>There were a few comments received which objected to the use of DOE standardsfor private sector use. Those who commented felt that although public inputwas solicited, DOE standards are not consensus standards in the mannerof standards sanctioned by the American Society of Testing and Measurements(ASTM). ASHRAE is actively pursuing the development of consensus standardsfor energy conservation in new construction and those who commented preferredthat DOE reference the ASHRAE standards. <T3>DOE Response:</T3>The Department's rulemaking is pursuant to a Federal law and the Departmentis obligated to promulgate under the provisions cited earlier in this Notice.Further, it is noted in this document, and others pertaining to the interimstandards, that the interim standards were designed for Federal agencyuse and not for non-Federal use. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Thermal Mass Comments </ITAG>Thermal mass received the largest number of comments. All of those whocommented on this issue were opposed to the proposed interim standardsbecause it gave no recognition to the energy conserving properties of massivemasonry construction. Those who commented indicated that failure to considermasonry's durability, low maintenance, structural characteristics and fireprotection (as opposed to fire resistance) will result in increased expenditureof tax dollars on construction, operation and maintenance of Federal residentialbuildings. It was also contended that implementation of the proposed interim standardswould produce severe economic impacts upon the masonry industry by placingbuilders who wish to utilize materials other than light frame constructionat a serious disadvantage in competing for military and other Federally-fundedhousing construction programs. Many who commented on this issue cited an October 31, 1985, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice (50 FR 45469) in which DOE announced resultsof its thermal mass research. They also indicated that this research wasbeing incorporated by ASHRAE and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory documents.Therefore, they did not accept DOE statements that data were not availableto include a treatment of masonry at the time of publication of the NOPR.Most suggested that promulgation of the interim standards be delayed untilDOE had included provisions for thermal mass, or that DOE should deferto private sector standard development activities, such as those beingundertaken by ASHRAE. <T3>DOE Response:</T3>The interim standards were developed primarily for use by Federal agencies.Thermal mass is not typically selected by Federal agencies to be includedin their residential construction projects. For this reason and the lackof acceptable data during initial standards development, thermal mass wasnot included in the original version of COSTSAFR (Version 1.0). However,since DOE has not yet made available building design standards specificallyfor use by the non-Federal sector and since the interim standards havethe concurrent purpose of serving as a design guideline to private sectorbuilders, DOE has decided to include thermal mass in the COSTSAFR computerprogram. After developing the thermal mass algorithms and formulae necessary toproperly update the COSTSAFR computer program, DOE will formally issuethermal mass revisions to COSTSAFR through a `` Notice of Proposed Modificationto Final Interim Rule with Request for Comments'' have an opportunity tosee exactly how DOE plans to integrate the thermal mass provisions intothe COSTSAFR computer program and provide their comments. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. COSTSAFR Program Comments </ITAG>The comments received on the COSTSAFR program were numerous and rangedfrom comments about its inadequacies as a working piece of computer softwareto dissatisfaction with its capabilities in setting energy consumptiongoals. The comments below are grouped into two categories, comments onthe use of the computer software and comments on the analyses and assumptionsused in the computer program. <ITAG tagnum="81">(a) Software Use Comments </ITAG>Some of those who commented were concerned that the COSTSAFR computer programwould require a high level of user sophistication and familiarity withpersonal computer (PC) operations. They felt that software conveniencefunctions typically found in ``business software'' should be added to COSTSAFR,such as page scrolling, batch installation procedures, a look-up routinefor cities, ability to save the points system files on a non-system disk,different version numbers, etc. These comments indicated that the additionof these functions would enhance the overall efficiency and ease of usingCOSTSAFR. In addition, some believed that the need to run COSTSAFR on acomputer equipped with an 8087 math co-processor chip was expensive andnot generally necessary for standard computer software. <T3>DOE Response:</T3>DOE is well aware that prescribing the use of a computer program in residentialbuilding standards is a major change from current practice. DOE's intentionin developing the computer compliance tool was to make the interim standardsmore rigorous, in terms of relating energy conservation options to therequired life cycle cost analyses, but at the same time simplify the calculationprocedures. In addition, DOE emphasizes that, as a mandatory Federal standard,only Federal agency personnel will be required to use the computer program.It will contain each Agency's own Federal cost guidelines for fuel andmaterials, specified building types and the location which determine theenergy conservation features for a particular project. The product of thecomputer program, the interim standards compliance form, is all the prospectivebidder will need to complete the energy conservation portion of a bid package.After Federal agency personnel identify the energy consumption goal requiredin a new project, they will write up contract specifications and issueRequests for Proposals to have these buildings constructed. Bidders willthen have an opportunity to compete for the construction work. <T3>Bidders will not have to use COSTSAFR to respond to an RFP. </T3>Individualswho wish to use COSTSAFR for the purpose of developing energy conservingpackages for their own purposes should be careful to use actual fuel, laborand material cost data for their area. In response to the comments on short-comings of COSTSAFR as a piece ofsoftware, DOE authorized many improvements to the computer program. Eachhas been included in the most recent version (Version 2.0). The revisedsoftware now provides a batch installation program, more user friendlydirections and keyboard manipulations, the ability to name and save files,and other items which make COSTSAFR easier to use. In addition, DOE willprovide a source code for COSTSAFR in a non-compiled format on a separatedisk. <ITAG tagnum="81">(b) Program Analyses and Assumptions Comments </ITAG>Many who commented expressed approval of the COSTSAFR computer programfor its innovation as a compliance tool and for what it was attemptingto accomplish, namely, to give designers reliable but time-saving methodto determine whether their energy conservation designs are optimal fora given location. However, even the strongest of its proponents requestedthe DOE to improve the computer program and develop a new User's Manualtogether with additional guides to the program's structure and algorithms.Those who commented did not totally agree with several assumptions andinputs made by DOE, or with the output of the computer program. They expressedconcern over the accuracy of the tradeoffs between energy conservationoptions. Several stated that could not achieve compliance with designsprepared for their geographic area because some of the energy conservationoptions specified were not common to construction practice. Several were concerned that the program did not appear to allow the flexibilityto introduce more innovative design strategies such as zoned heating, ground-coupledheat pumps, thermal storage and heat pump water heaters. <T3>DOE Response:</T3>DOE believes that many of the comments were based on a misunderstandingof COSTSAFR's intended purpose. Many of the comments may have been dueto the fact that COSTSAFR is designed so exclusively for Federal use andoperations. The building types, economic criteria, and energy conservationoptions chosen for COSTSAFR come directly from Federal agencies and maynot pertain to non-Federal sector use. The intent of the interim standardsand the COSTSAFR program is simply to minimize the life cycle energy coststo the Federal government for the heating, cooling and hot water featuresin a new residential building while still offering a wide variety of conservationoptions to a Federal agency's builders. Based on public comment and DOE's own testing of the COSTSAFR computerprogram, several minor programming and input errors were corrected. DOEbelieves that the COSTSAFR program is now valid for its intended purpose.As noted earlier DOE will continue to update COSTSAFR and intends to addan alternate compliance procedure as well as additonal information on thermalmass and windows in the near future. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. COSTSAFR Output Comments </ITAG>Comments on the COSTSAFR output refer to the compliance form printout generatedby the COSTSAFR computer program. The compliance form contains the requiredpoint values for each energy conservation option and allows those preparingproposals to calculate the point values of the designs they propose. Some who commented reported difficulty in understanding how to use thecompliance forms and attributed their problems to inadequacies in the computerprogram design and the instructions contained in the User's Manual. Somefound specific computer program ``bugs'' and provided useful informationto allow DOE to locate the errors. Several who commented asserted that without examples of the compliancecalculation procedures, it was difficult to understand how the complianceprocedures worked and therefore they could not provide useful comments.Others found it impossible to achieve compliance with example designs chosenfrom their own experience. In addition, comments were received questioningwhether design flexibility could really be achieved with the proposed compliancemethod. Several who commented asked for more information on the optimum selectionsused to generate the point total and the ``constants'' listed on the complianceforms. These constants are used in establishing point values for variousoptions. In addition, some who commented requested information on the equationsthat are imbedded in the COSTSAFR computer program. <T3>DOE Response:</T3>Some of the confusion experienced by those who commented may have beencaused through incorrect application of location multipliers by the computerprogram that were issued with the August 20, 1986, NOPR. The September23, 1986, addendum to the Technical Cupport Documents clarified and correctedthe location multipliers. A completed compliance form sample was includedin the addendum and is now included in the revised User's Manual. In addition,computer program ``bugs'', that were identified and located, were corrected.Unfortunately, some who commented did not provide sufficient informationto find the ``bugs'' they identified. However, DOE made a concerted effortto locate and rectify all programming errors. Other revisions related toCOSTSAFR Output comments include modifying the COSTSAFR program to displaythe optimal set of energy conservation strategies used to set the interimstandards, thus improving the compliance forms to make them more usable.In response to questions of design flexibility, the point system does allowtradeoffs between envelope insulation levels, window options, fuel typesand equipment efficiency levels and does include a wide variety of conservationoptions from which to choose. Also in the proposed amendments to COSTSAFRan alternate compliance procedure, that will allow for more innovativedesigns, will be proposed. However, the fact remains that options whichare less energy-conserving will receive fewer points and choosing themwill make it difficult to meet the interim standards. It should be rememberedthat the legislative requirement for the interim standards is that theyreduce non-renewable energy use to the maximum practicable extent. DOEstudies indicate that the interim standards can be met with sensible designsthat are cost-effective. Information regarding the mathematics, constants and processes used toestablish the point system, can be found in the 4th and 5th Chapters ofthe Technical Support Document. DOE has reviewed this document and madeany necessary changes. It believes that the Technical Support Documentadequately reflects COSTSAFR's operation. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Fenestration Comments </ITAG>Several comments were received concerning fenestration. One comment suggestedthat DOE eliminate the passive solar and sunspace options unless state-of-the-artDOE research was used to establish the options. A few comments were receivednoting that in the determination of minimum life-cycle costs, DOE requireswindow attributes to be among the base options while passive solar designsare modifying options. In practice, a distinction between windows and passivesolar windows may not be useful as an alternative and DOE should considerexpressing this distinction in terms of the extent of external window shading.Other comments questioned the fact that in the standards passive solarpoints are linear with window area in COSTSAFR, that the relationship betweenpassive solar options and other details of the building design are notaccounted for, including whether moveable insulation is used properly.<T3>DOE Response:</T3>In the interim standards, a window is considered to contribute to passivesolar design if the window area is arranged in an orientation more favorablethan having 25% in each cardinal direction. Shading is treated with heatabsorbing and heat reflective glazing. Data available during initial developmentof the interim standards did not permit explicit treatment of shading coefficients.The revision to COSTSAFR to be issued in the near future will include thisinformation along with the addition of Low-E glazings as an option. Passive solar points are awarded by COSTSAFR in addition to the windowtype and window area points. While improvements could be made to the passivesolar and sunspace data used in the standards, the most compatible informationwas used during development of the interim standards. Updated informationon passive solar design will be included in updates to COSTSAFR. Due tothe complexity of the interactions between passive solar and areas of thermalmass, these interactions are not presently accounted for in COSTSAFR. Amore extensive treatment of thermal mass will also appear in the revisionsto COSTSAFR. Studies conducted by the Navy that showed moveable insulation was effectivelyused both day and night support the assumptions in the standards. However,other studies conflict. DOE intends to leave moveable insulation in COSTSAFRas an option, but it will not be optimized along with the other options.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Equipment (General) Comments </ITAG>Approximately 20% of the comments received pertained to equipment requirements.These comments have been divided between this and following sections intocategories covering general equipment issues, equipment labels, heating,ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC), and domestic hot water (DHW) equipmentissues. Some of those who commented requested that DOE explain the mathematical``constants'' used in HVAC, DHW and appliance equipment sections of thecompliance form. Others indicated that several potential energy-conservingequipment options were missing from COSTSAFR. For example, DOE receivedseveral comments on heat pump water heaters which, the comments suggested,are employed extensively by the military. Others felt COSTSAFR lacks flexibility to consider modern innovative heatingsystems, cannot handle off peak electric water heating rates, and thatit is unfairly biased against electric water heating. <T3>DOE Response:</T3>The mathematical ``constants'' that appear in the equipment section ofthe compliance form are described in the Technical Support Document. DOEnotes that these numbers vary by housing type, fuel price, etc., so theydo not have a constant value for all compliance forms. The criterion for deciding which equipment to include in the COSTSAFR programwas whether or not DOE/FTC ratings were available (efficiency and energyguide labels). For the many types of equipment mentioned in the comments,no ratings are available. DOE agrees that the interim standards shouldnot impose barriers to the use of innovative and advanced equipment. Federalagencies using the interim standards can decide to accept efficiency ratingsprovided by nationally recognized testing organizations. In addition, analternate compliance procedure that utilizes a systems performance approachis being developed. The alternate compliance approach will allow buildersto demonstrate compliance of innovative building designs. DOE would like to note that it is not intended that the interim standardshave an inherent bias for or against particular fuels. However, the FederalOfficial using the COSTSAFR program can specify or eliminate certain fuelsin the compliance forms based on site availability. The intent of the interimstandards is to minimize energy cost regardless of fuel type. Other comments identified above are addressed in the equipment commentcategories below. <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Equipment (Labels) Comments </ITAG>Several who commented requested either a list or a source of the equipmentlabel information required for domestic hot water heaters and refrigerator/freezers.In addition, some who commented pointed out inaccuracies or useful additionsto the COSTSAFR computer program, the User's Manual, and the TechnicalSupport Document. Others pointed out that the DOE Domestic Hot Water informationdoes not include any efficient electric water heaters. They stated thatthe most efficient hot water heaters listed in the DOE data base turnedout to be approximately 48% less efficient than the most efficient electricwater heater for sale in utility showrooms. <T3>DOE Response:</T3>The sources for information on the various label values were included inthe addendum of September 23, 1986. In addition, these sources for equipmentefficiencies have been added to the User's Manual. The inaccuracies thatwere identified have been rectified and several of the suggested languagechanges have been made. The data base in the computer program includesthe most efficient water heaters included in the most recent version ofthe available source, the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association (GAMA)Consumer's Directory of Certified Water Heater Efficiency Ratings (July1987). For electric water heaters, builders can use the label values ofmore efficient equipment if available. <ITAG tagnum="81">9. Equipment (HVAC) Comments </ITAG>Several who commented found it problematic that the COSTSAFR program onlypermits comparative analysis of heating and cooling systems with ducteddistribution such as furnaces, heat pumps and central air conditioners,and does not give credit for zoned heating or cooling. Their suggestionwas that DOE add zoned heating/cooling system options to COSTSAFR and enhancethe data base to provide accurate cost estimates for such a system. The inclusion and application of DOE's degradation factors for heat pumpswas seen by some as arbitrary and unnecessary. Some observed that all HVACsystems operate at varying efficiencies from the manufacturer's labeledrating because of a number of factors. Other comments suggested that all equipment (not just heat pumps) shouldbe adjusted to account for variations in operation outside the range oftested ratings. They felt that by not doing this for all equipment, anunfair advantage may result in favor of one equipment type and consequentlyproduce unrealistic data for the compliance forms. Other comments claimed the relationship between the heating system performancefactor (HSPF) and seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) in COSTSAFR waserroneous and that the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute (ARI)Unitary Heat Pump Directory (ARI 210-81, ARI 210/240-84) should be referencedfor heat pump data. Also, some commenters observed that while more efficient equipment is frequentlyrequired by COSTSAFR to achieve compliance, requirements for equipmentwith a SEER of 15.0 and HSPF of 9.0 are overly optimistic. They indicatethat such equipment is not yet available in the marketplace. They suggesteda more realistic range of equipment ratings to help eliminate erroneousoperating cost estimates. <T3>DOE Response:</T3>All energy savings calculations in COSTSAFR have been estimated assumingsetback thermostats are employed. COSTSAFR implicitly assumes that zonedsystems have benefits equivalent to centrally-controlled systems with setback.Therefore, no extra credit is given to zoned systems. Homes with neitherducted air conditioning nor heating systems can be considered by Federalagencies by adding ducting costs to the first cost for ducted systems.The revised User's Manual provides information on typical ducting costsand how to add them to COSTSAFR. The degradation factor accounts for climate effects on heat pump performance.The degradation factors used by the proposed COSTSAFR program (Version1.0) were in error and have been corrected in the current program (Version2.0). The point system requires the input of the HSPF for heat pumps. Thisnumber accounts for all climatic degradations for a single baseline cityin the U.S. (Pittsburgh, PA.). The degradation factors in Version 1.0 ofthe program have been adjusted upward to set the baseline location (Pittsburgh,PA.) factor equal to one. This will result in locations warmer than thebaseline location having a factor greater than one, and colder locationswill have a factor less than one. There is no degradation factor includedfor cooling and other heating systems because the climate effects are relativelysmall. COSTSAFR must optimize on a single heat pump; it cannot determine the optimallife cycle cost for both heating and cooling and have two different heatpumps. Therefore, HSPFs and SEERs must be related in the optimization analysis.The relationship used in the program is based on a study of about 200 heatpumps and provides a typical correlation between HSPF and SEER values.In the point system, however, the proposer enters actual values for boththe HSPF and SEER and can get the appropriate credit for higher ratings.The numbers used are required to be those on the actual equipment proposedin the design. The ARI unitary heat pump directory is referred to in the updated User'sManual as the source for the heat pump efficiencies. Version 1.0 of the software contained errors in heat pump degradation factors(discussed above) and first cost. These errors in turn caused some of theresults of the analysis of heat pumps to be in error. Though the errorshad limited effect on previous analyses, they tended to result in selectionof more efficient heat pumps than was actually justified. These errorsare eliminated in Version 2.0. After investigating several equipment availability comments, DOE concludedthat heat pumps and air conditioners are available with approximately thesame efficiencies as are in the data base. DOE recognizes that equipmentwith very high efficiencies may be difficult to obtain in some parts ofthe country but believes that they should be included in COSTSAFR for usewhere they are available and a proposer wishes to include them in an optimaldesign solution. <ITAG tagnum="81">10. Equipment (DHW) Comments </ITAG>The most prevalent comments regarding DHW were that a penalty was placedon electric domestic water heating service by: not making it possible totake advantage of special electric water heater rates which can substantiallyimprove the life cycle cost of a residential structure; assigning negativepoints to electric DHW heaters in some cases; eliminating from the purviewof the COSTSAFR program heat pump water heaters, zonal electric heating,and heat reclaiming devices for hot water heaters; understating the lifeof electric DHW service; and addressing hot water heating separately fromother heating and cooling considerations thereby failing to give creditfor cost savings of electric systems when the costs for plumbing and ventingrequirements for gas equipment are eliminated. Many who submitted commentson this topic included considerable justification for their position, includingreports, papers and recently published accounts of heat pump water heaters.Moreover, they charged that by eliminating use of a common form of waterheating, the COSTSAFR program is in contradiction with the intent of therulemaking which is to enhance Federal design flexibility. <T3>DOE Response:</T3>The COSTSAFR program has always been able to accommodate separate electricalrates for heating and cooling seasons, but Version 2.0 now includes provisionsto permit a specific rate for domestic hot water use. The points assigned in the DHW section of the compliance forms are basedon energy savings over the lowest efficiency equipment for the optimalfuel. This fuel is normally gas for water heating. The life cycle costsfor even high efficiency electric hot water equipment are often higherthan costs for the lowest efficiency gas equipment. Because of this, theelectric water heater will often correctly earn negative points. Many of the uncommon water heater types mentioned by those who commentedwere not included because of lack of efficiency test data. Federal agenciescould include these systems when appropriate data become available. Servicelife of both electric and gas DHW equipment has been set in the revisedprogram to 15 years. COSTSAFR does not consider connection costs for any fuel or system type.These costs should affect the overall housing project cost and, therefore,be accounted for in the proposer's bid. <ITAG tagnum="81">11. R-Values Comments </ITAG>The few who commented objected to the use of R-values to measure complianceof the building envelope. They stated that the use of R-values may notbe sufficiently accurate to predict the thermal performance of wall systemsdue to the effects of other thermal transmission through framing membersand other wall components. They suggested the use of U-values. In addition,those who commented asserted that the minimum allowable R-value (R-11)permitted is inappropriate for masonry walls. <T3>DOE Response:</T3>The COSTSAFR computer program does use U-values, which take into accountinsulation R-values and typical construction practices. The point systemprovides and uses R-values, however, since they are the values most familiarto designers and the building community. The revisions to COSTSAFR previouslydiscussed will permit lower R-values for masonry walls. <ITAG tagnum="81">12. Multi-Family Housing Comments </ITAG>Several commented that the COSTSAFR program should be revised to includemulti-family housing and reissued for review. The version circulated wasn'table to calculate for multi-family structures. <T3>DOE Response:</T3>COSTSAFR includes two-story townhouses and small apartments. The interimstandards are not intended for buildings more than three stories high.For standards covering buildings of more than three stories, designersare referred to the proposed DOE Energy Conservation Standards for NewCommercial and Multi- Family High Rise Buildings which were published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>for public review. <ITAG tagnum="81">13. Area Cost Multiplier Comments </ITAG>Several who commented requested DOE to: (a) Provide lists of where datapertinent to the area cost multipliers could be found; (b) provide a discussionof how the multipliers are used; and, (c) provide a discussion of how theycan be amended by the user. The concern was the validity of using a singlecost multiplier for each region of the country to adjust the various costs(materials, labor, fuel, etc.) that go into producing the compliance forms.From others there was the suggestion that a multiplier may not be the bestway to update price data for Federal buildings. They indicated the beliefthat Federal agencies will need a central source of data for updating pricesand DOE was asked to consider issuing a new data base every 5 years. <T3>DOE Response:</T3>The Area Cost Multiplier is a uniform method of correcting the cost database values to account for regional variations and is currently used byFederal agencies in making those corrections. This may not be accuratefor all costs; however, the program user can change the costs to suit hisown individual needs. Each Federal construction agency officials will haveto assume the responsibility for keeping price data current. Therefore,area cost multipliers will be the responsibility of the Federal agency.DOE is using the most recent set in establishing COSTSAFR as a compliancetool. When such multipliers are not available, it is suggested that proposersreference those developed by the U.S. Department of Defense. (See User'sManual, Appendix B, for discussion.) DOE believes that area cost multipliers are an effective way to keep pricescurrent between updates of COSTSAFR. Because they change with time theyare not included in the User's Manual. However, the Manual now gives sourcesfor the multipliers as well as label values. <ITAG tagnum="81">14. Economic Variables Comments </ITAG>Quite a few of those who commented requested additional information andexplanations of the equipment and material costs built into the COSTSAFRprogram. They asserted that they were unable, on first try, to meet compliancelevels using electric space and water heating equipment based on currentenergy costs in their service territories. Consequently, the validity ofthe COSTSAFR computer program was questioned. Many who commented on thisissue pointed out that the proposed economic variables dictate that naturalgas option would most likely be used and the impact of the interim standardswould be to increase consumption of this critical resource. Mentioned specifically were observations that: (a) Omissions of variationsin utility rate schedules, such as seasonal pricing, time of day pricing,and block charges, is a mistake and may bias the interim standards towardnatural gas as an energy source rather than electricity; (b) fuel priceprojections based on residential rates for actual fuel prices that areoutside the normal residential rate structure are inappropriate; and, (c)cost data for HVAC equipment and appliances was taken from a 1982 DOE Reportfor which it is uncertain whether revalidation occurred. Comments from several electric utilities stated that the COSTSAFR programdoes not address the non-system costs unique to different HVAC equipmenttypes. Such items include flues, provisions for combustion air, sealingand insulating indoor equipment rooms, extra utility connections, lineextensions, associated plumbing, and additional wiring capacity. They statedthat COSTSAFR needs to address these conditions before it can provide atrue economic analysis. <T3>DOE Response:</T3>The interim standards are based on life cycle cost analysis; therefore,energy costs are considered along with first cost. Relative fuel pricesmay make it harder to meet the cost- effective optimum requirements forone fuel if that fuel is more expensive than the optimum fuel. COSTSAFRdoes not in any way provide preference to one fuel over another, but thecost-based criterion for setting the requirements may make it difficultfor a relatively expensive fuel to meet the necessary requirements. DOE believes that the cost-effectiveness test built into the interim standardswill lead to reductions in energy consumption in new Federal housing. Usingthe market price of fuel to set requirements reflects the value of thatfuel at the local and national level and the interim standards make noassumptions about one fuel relative to another. It will be the responsibility of the Federal agency using COSTSAFR to calculatean accurate estimate of the average seasonal electrical rate if specialrates apply, and update, if necessary, with more relevant fuel prices.Federal agencies are required to use DOE's Federal Energy Management Program(FEMP) fuel price projections and these are built into COSTSAFR. Wherecost data figures appear questionable for an area, the cost data base,which has been adjusted to 1987 levels, can be modified by the area costmultiplier or the costs can be changed as necessary on an individual basis.As noted before, in cases where non-ducted systems are proposed, the Federalagency can modify the cost data base in COSTSAFR to include ducting costsfor central systems. The updated User's Manual provides helpful informationon this procedure. Any other system costs that the Federal agency deemedappropriate to include could be added in the cost data base, but properchanges would have to be made for all system types. <ITAG tagnum="81">15. User's Manual Comments </ITAG>Not many comments were received on the User's Manual per se. However, thosewho commented reported that through trial and error they discovered thatthe system does not operate on MS-DOS or PC-DOS systems earlier than DOS3.1. Others commented that the instructions for using COSTSAFR were not verywell detailed, the criteria poorly conceived, important steps were skipped,and the instructions did not specify the types of printers that must beused to operate the program. The suggestions offered by those who commentedwere for DOE to have people who prepare user-friendly manuals for a livingprepare the User's Manual and to definitely include examples showing howCOSTSAFR generates compliance forms. With respect to the contents of the User's Manual, several comments werereceived suggesting that this was the appropriate place for DOE to includeall the various types of input data Federal agencies will need in orderto operate the COSTSAFR Program. Two types of input data recommended forinclusion were the area cost multipliers and equipment label efficiencies.This would assure that each Federal agency analysis is based on the sameinput assumptions. In addition, they felt that DOE should plan to updatethese data regularly with input from the public. <T3>DOE Response:</T3>Many commenters expressed concern that they were unable to run COSTSAFRon their versions of DOS. However, DOE checked into this thoroughly andconcluded that COSTSAFR operates on DOS 2.0 or later versions of DOS. TheUser's Manual was edited and revised because it was clear that many instructionswere misunderstood. In response to most of the comments, the Manual wasedited to improve clarity. A batch installation program has also been added.Since outputs are ASCII files they should print out on any printer. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Procedural Requirements </ITAG>A. National Enviromental Policy Act DOE prepared and issued on August 20, 1986, concurrently with the proposedinterim standards, an Environmental Assessment (EA) of the proposed interimstandards under the Implementing Regulations of the Council of EnvironmentalQuality (CEQ) (40 CFR Parts 1500-1800) and the National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA), as amended (Pub. L. 91-190, U.S.C. 4221 et. seq.),which requires agencies to conduct environmental assessments when theirregulations constitute a significant Federal action. A Finding of No SignificantImpact was issued in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>at 50 FR 29773 on August 20, 1986. The EnvironmentalAssessment concluded that no significant impacts will result to the indooror outdoor environments from implementing the Interim Energy ConservationMandatory Performance Standards for New Federal Residential Buildings.Based upon the findings in the Environmental Assessment, DOE determinedthe proposed interim standards do not constitute a major federal actionsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment within themeaning of NEPA B. Executive Order No. 12291 Section 3 of Executive Order No. 12291, 46 FR 13193, February 12, 1281,requires that DOE determine whether a proposed rule is a ``major rule''as defined by section 1(b) of that Order, and prepare a preliminary regulatoryimpact analysis for rules which fall within that definition. DOE prepared an ``Economic Analysis,'' 51 FR 29770, August 20, 1986 whereinDOE reviewed the proposed Final Interim Rule. DOE has determined that therule will not have an annual effect on the national economy of $100 millionor more, nor certain other effects listed in the Order, and that the FinalInterim Rule is not a ``major rule'' within the meaning of the Order. The rule was submitted to the Director of the Office of Management andBudget for a 10 day review period as required by section 3(c)(3) of ExecutiveOrder No. 12291. The Director has concluded his review under that ExecutiveOrder. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603,604) requires DOE to calculatethe effect its rulemaking will have on small businesses in the nation.DOE analyzed the small business impacts the rule would have, includingits impacts upon manufacturers of building and construction materials andequipment, architects, builders, construction companies, and utilities.In accordance with the findings of Chapter 3 of the Economic Analysis,51 FR 29770, August 20, 1986, DOE certifies that the Interim Energy ConservationStandards for New Federal Residential Buildings will not have significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities. D. Paperwork Reduction Act No information collection or record keeping requirements are imposed onthe public by the Final Interim Rule. Accordingly, authorizations are notrequired under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq., asamended, or its implementing regulations, 5 CFR Part 132. <ITAG tagnum="84">V.
