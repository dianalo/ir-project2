The winner, whose name was not disclosed, will appear Sunday at anews conference in the District of Columbia with the director of theD.C. lottery, Lotto America officials said.   The lone winning ticket for the game's largest prize, picked inthe Feb. 18 drawing, was sold at a mini-mart in Washington.   There was no indication why the winner waited almost a week toclaim the prize.   It's the first time that anyone outside of Iowa or Kansas has wonthe multistate lottery game, which began about a year ago. Theprevious record jackpot, $13.6 million, was claimed by a Norwalk,Iowa, couple in December.   The winner has one year from the date of the drawing to claim theprize, said Charles Strutt, executive director of the Multi-StateLottery Association, which oversees the game. If the $16 million hadremained unclaimed, it would have been divided among the states inthe Lotto America game, according to the percentage of sales in eachplace for that jackpot, Strutt said.   Other states participating in Lotto America are Missouri, Oregon,West Virginia and Rhode Island.   The winning numbers were 9, 17, 20, 28, 46 and 50.
