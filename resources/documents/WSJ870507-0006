Meanwhile, a budget-related battle began to intensify as Treasury Secretary James Baker got a frigid reception when he asked House Republicans to support an increase needed later this month in the federal borrowing limit.    By a vote of 56-42, the Senate last night adopted a budget outline, drafted by Budget Committee Chairman Lawton Chiles (D., Fla.). The plan would allow military spending to rise at a rate equal to inflation in the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1, but only if President Reagan agrees to an $18.3 billion tax increase also contained in the budget resolution.    President Reagan has said he strongly disapproves of so large a tax increase, and he advocates a larger rise in military spending than the Senate's budget plan contains. As a result, only three Republicans joined the 53 Democratic senators present in voting for the Chiles plan.    The measure must now be reconciled with the House-passed version. The reconciled version then must be approved by both chambers before it will be used as a guide for congressional action.    The House passed a budget resolution for fiscal 1988 that would raise taxes $18 billion, reduce projected nonmilitary spending $9 billion and cut military spending $9 billion, compared with the inflation-adjusted level.    The Senate-passed resolution would allow military spending to increase with inflation, to $290.6 billion next fiscal year, and would reduce projected nonmilitary spending $8.6 billion. It would raise taxes $18.3 billion, but doesn't specify what kinds of taxes. It also would take in an additional $7.2 billion by refinancing loans from the Rural Electrification Administration.    An earlier Democratic plan had placed military outlays $7 billion lower. But under pressure from moderate Democrats, that money would be added and tied to the tax increase. The agreement helped produce the unusual unanimity among the Democrats in favor of the budget plan.    In other budget action, the Senate overwhelmingly rejected President Reagan's budget proposal, and also approved a non-binding resolution that taxes shouldn't be raised by increasing the income-tax rates that were just lowered by last year's tax-overhaul bill.    Also, the Senate rejected a Republican substitute budget, mostly along party lines. The plan, authored by Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), would have raised fewer taxes and increased military spending more than the Democrats' plan.    None of the budget plans hit the Gramm-Rudman law's deficit target of $108 billion in fiscal 1988, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.    Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) of the Senate Finance Committee told the Senate that his panel would look to &quot;closing loopholes&quot; and raising excise taxes and user fees if the committee is directed to raise revenues. But he said he couldn't rule out other options.    In the House, Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) told the Reagan administration that he would be unwilling to force his Democratic majority to a vote for a long-term extension of the federal borrowing limit unless a majority of House Republicans is willing to go along.    He added, however, that he would advocate a short-term extension, of at least two months, if the GOP failed to come up with enough votes. &quot;We'll do what has to be done,&quot; he said.    Secretary Baker is eager to enact a long-term extension, perhaps through May 1988, and to avoid conflict over the debt-ceiling issue in general. This time, the debt limit reverts to last year's level if Congress fails to act by May 15 to raise it, and the chance for actual default on federal obligations is increased.    To avoid the problem, Mr. Baker visited the House Republican Conference yesterday to ask for support for a long-term debt-ceiling increase free of extraneous amendments. His request wasn't welcomed.    According to those familiar with the meeting, several Republicans berated Mr. Baker for ignoring them and making deals on fiscal matters with the Democrats. Others asserted that defeating the debt-ceiling increase bill would send a necessary signal about the need for more fiscal restraint than the Democrats are showing. One member, Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, even suggested that actual default would produce favorable consequences to the world economy, a comment Mr. Baker disputed.    An aide to House Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois said the leader wouldn't push his GOP members to vote for the long-term extension unless he was assured by Senate leaders that an amendment-free long-term extension bill would be forthcoming from that chamber. In the Senate, the debt-ceiling increase has been complicated by amendments.    Such assurances haven't been made by the Senate. In the meantime, several House Republicans are considering demanding from the administration a variety of measures, many of them unrelated to the debt issue, in exchange for their votes on the borrowing limit. </TEXT></DOC>
