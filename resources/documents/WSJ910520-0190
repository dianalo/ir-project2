An operating system is both crucial and inconsequential.An application package -- such as a spreadsheet or wordprocessor -- doesn't speak the same language as computerhardware. An operating system has to translate. So whenpeople refer to a computer as IBM-compatible, for example,what they are really saying is that it can run a certainoperating system -- DOS, in the case of IBM.</LP><TEXT>   At the same time, the operating system is supposed to beinvisible to a user. A user has a hard enough time figuringout the commands in an application package without having toknow what to do when he confronts DOS itself and finds &quot;C:&quot;staring at him on the screen, with no clue how to proceed.   Computer dealers and consultants say the best way tochoose an operating system is still to find an applicationyou need, and then buy a computer with whatever operatingsystem that application requires.   &quot;Most end-users view the operating system as a necessaryevil,&quot; says Matt Fitzsimmons, a ComputerLand dealer in WhitePlains, N.Y.   For those who want to venture further into the unknown,here is a primer on the main operating systems they mayconfront in a dealer's showroom or may stumble across in thepress:                                                                                                          DOS                                                                                                          Short for Disk Operating System, DOS is a 10-year-oldsystem that critics assail as &quot;character-based.&quot; That meansusers have to type in commands, which they must memorize (ifthey don't want to refer to the manual every time they turnon the computer). Some applications build on top of DOS andare &quot;menu-based,&quot; meaning that users get a list of writtencommands to choose from at each step in the application.   DOS is also maligned as a rudimentary system that doesn'tallow for such advanced capabilities as &quot;multitasking&quot; -- theability to use an application such as a word processor while,say, a spreadsheet recalculates in the background.   But some 60 million copies have been sold over the pastdecade, so DOS must be doing something right. The main thingis that there are thousands and thousands of applicationsbuilt on top of DOS.   &quot;When you talk about PCs, especially PCs and smallbusiness, DOS is still where the action is,&quot; says WillFastie, editor of the Fastie Report, an industry newsletterbased in Baltimore, Md.                                                                                                          WINDOWS                                                                                                          The introduction of Windows 3.0 last year was perhaps thebiggest event in the personal-computer industry in manyyears. Microsoft Corp. has sold nearly three million copiesin the first year and shows no signs of slowing down.   Windows isn't really an operating system; it's an&quot;interface&quot; that makes DOS more powerful and easier to use.The main point about Windows is that it is graphical -- thatis, it lets users navigate through an application or movebetween applications by choosing from among little pictures,or &quot;icons,&quot; on a screen.   Many Apple Computer Inc. devotees say the AppleMacintosh's graphical operating system is still easier to usethan Windows 3.0. But even they acknowledge that Windows putsIBM-compatible computers in the same ballpark. That meansapplications built on Windows should be easier to learn thanthose built on DOS alone, and that it should be simpler tomove data out of one application into another by usingWindows.   There are limitations, however. Not much software is yetavailable that takes advantage of Windows. It also requires acomputer with more memory and a more powerful processor thandoes DOS -- dealers typically recommend two to four megabytesof main memory and some form of the Intel Corp. 80386processor. And Windows 3.0 is new enough that some users arestill reporting bugs, including serious ones that can wipeout some data.   Dealers say those using PCs at home or in small businesseswill probably use Windows eventually, but they don't need todo it just yet.                                                                                                          OS/2   This was supposed to replace DOS soon after Microsoft andInternational Business Machines Corp. introduced it in 1987.But only a few hundred thousand copies have been sold, andmany of those went to software developers rather than users.   IBM has yet to give up. Last month, it began an OS/2marketing campaign that may cost as much as $40 million. Itis also bringing out a new version that is meant to addressusers' complaints.   OS/2 has some adherents among big corporate users becauseit is graphical, provides for multitasking and makescommunication with a mainframe easy.   But the system does little for those who don't havecorporate data-processing departments that customizesoftware, and who don't have a mainframe in their basement.That is because there is still very little OS/2-basedsoftware available. And even the lean version of the systemrequires at least as much memory and computing power asWindows.   The OS/2 system also is extraordinarily complex,reflecting IBM's mainframe heritage. One user complains thatbefore IBM would even try to answer a question on the system,he had to have IBM send him an update, which turned out to beso complex that it filled 15 high-density floppy diskettes.(Even if you don't understand exactly what that means, youget the idea.)                                                                                                          UNIX                                                                                                          Originally built by technoweenies for technoweenies inAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. laboratories, Unix(pronounced &quot;enunuchs&quot;) has recently come to the fore. It isused on most work stations and is starting to find its wayinto some big businesses.   It, like OS/2, is a powerful operating system that allowsfor multitasking and can be used for communicating acrossnetworks of personal computers. For scientists and engineers,there is also a wealth of software available that runs onUnix.   But for other individuals and small businesses performingmore prosaic tasks, Unix has OS/2's problems. There is moresoftware available for Unix, and it doesn't eat up quite thememory that OS/2 does, but anyone who has ever tried towrestle with the message &quot;mount: /dev/fd,0a on/ mnt: Invalidargument?&quot; will find that Unix may be even more complex.                                                                                                          MACINTOSH                                                                                                          Although Apple's Macintosh operating system remainssomewhat easier to use than Windows, the main advantage is inthe Macintosh applications. They have resembled each otherclosely ever since Apple co-founder Steven Jobs beat onsoftware developers to follow his guidelines. Also, much moresoftware is available for the Mac than for Windows.   Apple is hoping to keep ahead of the Windows wave bybringing out a new release of its Macintosh operating system.The much-delayed release, called System 7, will makecommunicating with mainframes easier and will make it simplerto link applications -- with changes to a spreadsheetautomatically updating a letter stored in a word processor,for instance.   But the Windows and Macintosh worlds are becoming similar,and will become more so because almost every Macintoshsoftware company is busily doing applications that work withWindows.   ---   Mr. Carroll is a staff reporter in The Wall StreetJournal's New York bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
