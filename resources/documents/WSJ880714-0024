Several alliance officials say NATO's cumbersome internal bargaining process is becoming bogged down further as it strains to respond to Mr. Gorbachev's sweeping suggestions. NATO must achieve consensus from 16 different nations; lately Mr. Gorbachev appears to be speaking for the Warsaw Pact as if he alone made the decisions. The U.S. has added to the confusion here by predicting a move by the Soviet leader that appears to be fictitious.    The Soviet Foreign Ministry said yesterday it doesn't have any plans for a unilateral withdrawal of 65,000 Russian troops from Hungary. A U.S. State Department official had predicted such a withdrawal in an unusual background briefing for reporters on Friday -- -an apparent effort to undercut the publicity Mr. Gorbachev is attracting in the arms-control arena.    The widespread political impact of Mr. Gorbachev's gestures and the West's nervousness about them have provoked &quot;very direct and emotional discussions&quot; within NATO, says one alliance official. Internal debates now raging exhibit depths of uncertainty and anxiety that haven't been seen since the 1960s, he adds.    The debates over Mr. Gorbachev's proposals are exacerbated, according to participants, by other mounting concerns. Among them: worry over U.S. defense-budget and balance-of-payment problems; signs of a generational change among young Europeans, especially West Germans, that makes them more receptive to the Soviet leader; and a growing feeling of isolation in Turkey and Norway, which constitute NATO's flanks.    Also complicating the defense picture is yesterday's announcement by Greece that U.S. bases must be removed from the country by mid-1990.    NATO's own plans for conventional-arms control will take weeks, perhaps months to complete, alliance officials predict. A major obstacle is that NATO's decisions require all 16 member states to concur. One nation's objections can delay and even doom a specific proposal. Lately, there have been a lot of objections.    &quot;He {Gorbachev} appears to be able to speak not only for himself, but for his {Warsaw Pact} allies, and he does so on a 24-hour basis,&quot; says Alton G. Keel, Jr., the U.S. ambassador to NATO. But, he insists, the Soviet leader's moves won't impair &quot;a careful, step-by-step&quot; formulation of NATO proposals.    Another reason for the frustration here is that Mr. Gorbachev's proposals include some promising changes, carefully intertwined with public-relations moves designed to polish his pro-peace image in Western Europe.    &quot;He does it in a way to appeal to the public. I must say this doesn't enhance his credibility with people who know,&quot; argues Neils Hansen, West Germany's ambassador to NATO. Mr. Hansen believes arms-control packages, especially in the knotty, poorly understood area of conventional weapons, are too complicated &quot;to be thrown out in the air like this.&quot;    Perhaps the biggest rose NATO officials see in the Soviet leader's latest batch of proposals is a promised data exchange requiring both sides to disclose their troop and equipment dispositions in Central Europe. Previous Soviet intransigence on this issue -- considered fundamental to verifying withdrawals -- has stalled conventionalarms talks in Vienna for 14 years.    Among the bigger thorns is a Gorbachev proposal this week to remove &quot;analagous means of aviation&quot; from Eastern Europe if NATO doesn't move a wing of 72 U.S. F-16 fighters to Italy. The Soviet idea seems designed to complicate Italian political decisions regarding the move. It also is aimed at the heart of NATO's stance in Vienna: a refusal to discuss shorter-range nuclear weapons until the Warsaw Pact reduces its tank-heavy conventional forces. NATO would like to keep the F-16's out of conventional-arms talks because the fighters can carry nuclear bombs.    Meanwhile, NATO's military leaders worry that the Soviet leader's &quot;charm offensive&quot; has initiated a kind of unilateral disarmament in the West. They say Mr. Gorbachev's efforts make political decisions to modernize weapons, especially short-range nuclear weapons, much more difficult.    Times have changed since the early 1980s, when the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan stiffened NATO's resolve to pump more money into defense, Gen. Wolfgang Altenburg, chairman of NATO's military committee, recently told a group of defense experts in London. &quot;The danger to NATO was never when they invaded another country . . . but, boy when they start smiling, that's when it gets tough.&quot;    NATO analysts believe Mr. Gorbachev has more shoes ready to drop. One possibility is the unilateral withdrawal of several thousand Soviet tanks from Central Europe. The step would enhance further his peaceful image, but in reality would increase Soviet military readiness because many Russian tanks are old and increasingly hard to repair.    Mr. Gorbachev's effort to set Europe's arms-control agenda will become more difficult in the fall, when the 23 nations in both alliances hope to begin a new set of conventional-arms talks. By then, NATO may have a consensus on plans to verify a &quot;shock-proof&quot; realignment of forces that would thin out both sides' offensive weapons, such as tanks, and give warning of a military buildup on either side.    At those talks, Mr. Gorbachev will have to make proposals that cut Soviet arms production, making funds available to help his promised resurgence in the Soviet Union's sagging economy, argues Malcolm Chalmers, a defense analyst at the University of Bradford in England.    &quot;Taking out older forces isn't going to save them much money,&quot; he adds. And Mr. Gorbachev's proposal to remove aircraft -- which easily can fly back to Central Europe during a crisis -- would be meaningless unless they are destroyed, Mr. Chalmers says.    Levels of Soviet arms production, which constitutes a major segment of the Soviet economy, have remained unchanged since Mr. Gorbachev took office in the spring of 1985, according to NATO.    ---             Conventional Forces in Europe                                                  WARSAW                                   NATO             PACT Soldiers                     2,385,000        2,292,000 Tanks                           22,200           52,200 Artillery                       11,100           37,000 Helicopters                        780            1,630 Combat Aircraft                  3,292            7,438   Source: International Institute for Strategic Studies, London</TEXT></DOC>
