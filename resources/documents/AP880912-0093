(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Shivering firefightersrejoiced as snow eased their battle against blazes that haveblackened more than 1 million acres, but a forecast for warm, dryweather kept them on guard.   ``I just love it. It means we might get to go home earlier,''firefighter John Massey said Sunday as snow dusted much ofYellowstone National Park.   Three to 4 inches fell in areas south of Mammoth Hot Springs.Humidity was as high as 90 percent, and temperatures in the mid-30scombined with winds of up to 30 mph for a wind chill index of 19degrees.   ``Things for the short term are better here,'' park spokeswomanAmy Vanderbilt said.   ``We're more optimistic this morning than we have been for someweeks,'' said Bill Baden, Forest Service director at theInteragency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, in an interview today onCBS ``This Morning.'' The center coordinates forest fire fightingnationwide.   In the Sierra Nevada foothills of California, a wind-whippedfire that began Sunday charred 12,000 acres of brush and timber,destroyed 13 homes and seven to 17 other structures, and forcedresidents of Lake Wildwood, Calif., a town of 4,500, to evacuatetoday for a second time.   About 1,200 firefighters fought the blaze today in the historicGold Rush country, said California Department of Forestry spokesmanCharlie Jakobs. At one point, flames engulfed a bulldozer, forcingits operator to wrap himself in an asbestos blanket and take refugeunder his vehicle. He suffered minor burns.   Light snow and low temperatures also helped firefighters inIdaho, and rain and cooler weather slowed fires in Colorado.   In northwest Oregon, officials closed millions of acres ofstate-protected forests in an effort to curb the number of firescaused by human carelessness.   In Montana, crews took advantage of the cool weather to carvelines around a forest fire north of Yellowstone and another thathas scorched more than 30,000 acres in and around Glacier NationalPark near the Canadian border.   At Glacier, two firefighters were injured when a tree fellacross the back of an open truck carrying crews to a 30,400-acrefire, officials said.   At Yellowstone, the light snow had firefighters shivering aroundpropane heaters Sunday night. Fire managers joked thatfears beforethe weekend of another ``Black Saturday'' _ when fires on Saturday,Aug. 20, sent blazes roaring across 150,000 acres _ melted when``White Sunday'' arrived.   Firefighters were pulled off the lines Sunday when the chill setin.   ``Our hoses were freezing up as fast as we put them out,'' saidWayne Jones, a fire crew chief from Bushnell, Fla.   Today's forecast was almost as good as Sunday's weather: achance of rain or snow, temperatures no higher than the 50s andlight winds.   But by Tuesday, a drying trend is expected, with temperaturesclimbing back into the 60s and 70s.   ``In five or six days we could be back in a more severe weathersituation,'' Baden said.   Firefighters took advantage of Sunday's good weather to shore uptheir defenses against the wildfires, which have blackened about900,000 of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres since June in whatfirefighters call the worst fire season in the West in 30 years.   The weather allowed park officials to reopen the west entranceand the road from there to Old Faithful and Madison Junction northof the famed geyser. The rest of the park remained closed tovisitors.   Residents of park headquarters at Mammoth were allowed to returnhome, but were told to be ready for another evacuation if flamesfrom a 263,400-acre fire threatens the area again.   A 328,100-acre fire in the park's northeast quadrant expandedsignificantly, combining with an 87,500-acre fire. But weatherconditions helped firefighting crews, enabling them to attack theblaze directly.   Lower temperatures raise humidity, and the moisture is soaked upby tinder-dry trees, said Joe Halliday, chief naturalist forYellowstone's west district.   The wood will ``be less likely to burn, although the fireshouldn't have much trouble,'' Halliday said.   ``Basically with this cold front that's moved in, it's going toput us kind of in a holding pattern,'' said park spokeswoman MartyTobias.   Cabinet officials, who toured Yellowstone National Park over theweekend on President Reagan's orders, said the fires must beextinguished, and said the policy of letting naturally ignitedwildfires in national parks and wilderness areas burn unless theythreaten property or people hasn't worked.   ``The most important thing is to concentrate our efforts ongetting these fires under control and then out,'' InteriorSecretary Donald Hodel said Sunday at the Boise Interagency FireCenter in Idaho, which coordinates Western firefighting efforts.   ``The old policy has to be reviewed and altered,'' Hodel said.``Nobody who has seen it operate this year could say it was asuccess.''   Hodel was accompanied by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng andDeputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV.   Taft said two Marine battalions _ 1,200 men _ from CampPendleton, Calif., and two additional Army battalions would be sentto help fight fires. About 2,300 Army soldiers from Fort Lewis,Wash., have already been dispatched.</TEXT></DOC>
