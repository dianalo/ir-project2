David Runkel, commenting on a proposal contained in a lengthylist of gun-control options published this week, said Thornburgh``is opposed to that and would not recommend it to the president.''   ``He feels that's an infringement on rights of Americans andbelieves that is not the way to tackle this problem,'' the spokesmansaid.   Thornburgh opposed a similar plan that was advanced in the 1970swhen he was assistant attorney general in charge of the JusticeDepartment's criminal division, Runkel said.   The card plan has been strongly opposed by organizations of gunowners.   The task force study was required by Congress last year as partof anti-drug legislation. Congress, noting that illegal weapons playan increasing role in the epidemic of illegal drugs, ordered areview of ways to try to keep felons from buying guns.   The 40-page study, published Monday in the Federal Register,outlined a variety of possibilities grouped along two generalapproaches.   One method would be aimed at potential gun buyers and wouldrequire them to show certification that they have no criminal record.   The second involves the country's 270,000 gun dealers and wouldrequire them to check with local and federal police agencies toquickly search computerized records before making any of the 7.5million annual weapons deals.   The identity card has long been opposed by the National RifleAssociation, along with civil liberties groups.   The task force noted that opposition. ``We are keenly aware ofthe significant concerns about protecting the privacy interests ofall citizens,'' the panel said.   It did not recommend whether any of the options should actuallybe implemented. Nor did it spell out which firearms would beinvolved.   President Bush, a lifelong member of the NRA, has proposed apermanent ban on the importation of semiautomatic assault-stylerifles.   The Firearm Owner's Identification Card could be applied for longbefore a person intended to purchase a gun. It would beelectronically encoded with information about an individual'sbackground and the card could be decoded by machines that would beavailable to gun dealers.   Currently, there is no requirement at the federal level for anycheck of the eligibility of a gun purchaser. But 29 states and theDistrict of Columbia require that a pre-purchase check be made of anindividual's criminal history.   The study also lists a variety of other options, includingcentralized record keeping to replace the current hodge-podge ofwidely scattered files; live electronic scans of buyers'fingerprints by gun dealers at the time of purchase; and telephonechecks of police records. Costs of the programs range up to $10billion, the panel noted.   The panel didn't attempt to figure out ways to identify otherpersons, aside from convicted felons, who try to buy guns. That taskshould be done by a private contractor and such a study is now inthe planning stages, the task force said.   The study was ordered by Congress last fall, shortly before itadjourned for the year, as the chamber wrote a package of anti-druglegislation.   One proposal proposed as part of the bill called for a seven-daywaiting period before a handgun could be purchased. Opponents said astudy should be done before any waiting period was imposed and theplan published Monday was designed to meet that requirement.</TEXT></DOC>
