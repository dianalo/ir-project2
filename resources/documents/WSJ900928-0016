Grubman,a telecommunications analyst with PaineWebber Inc., phonecompany earnings &quot;will look really good.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The phone industry's numbers, however, don't necessarilyreflect a robust performance. Profits in the year-earlierquarter were depressed by one-time charges, labor-settlementcosts and new state regulatory structures that requiredinitial rate cuts.   Analysts anticipate earnings for the regional Bellcompanies to rise 6% to 14%, with the exception of BellSouthCorp. The outlook for the long-distance companies isn't sofavorable.   MCI Communications Corp.'s earnings will be diluted by thecompany's $1.25 billion acquisition of Telecom USA and dampedby a higher tax rate. American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.continues to be hurt by start-up costs associated with itscredit card business. United Telecommunications Inc., theKansas City-based owner of US Sprint long-distance service,is still recovering from a $72 million charge in the secondquarter related to a $42 million operating loss at Sprint.   Analysts anticipate MCI will post profits of 65 cents ashare, up 4% from 62 cents a share, or $165 million, in theyear-earlier period. Robert B. Morris III, atelecommunications analyst with Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. said MCIwill be hurt by higher taxes in addition to dilution. Lastyear, MCI's tax rate was 28%, compared with the current 33%level. &quot;That's about a nickel a share,&quot; says Mr. Morris.   For United Telecom, analyst foresee quarterly earningsslumping about 11%. Earnings are projected at 40 cents ashare, compared with 45 cents a share a year earlier, whenthe company earned $94.6 million. ATandamp;T's profits areanticipated to be about 66 cents a share, up a modest 2% from65 cents a share, or $699 million, in the year-earlierquarter.   Analysts expect minutes-of-use for the long-distancesegment to grow between 9% and 10%.   For the regional Bell companies, U S West Inc. should leadthe pack. Analysts estimate that U S West profits will rise14%, from 69.5 cents a share, or $258.1 million, in theyear-earlier quarter. U S West's earnings in the year-earlierperiod were hurt by rate reductions in Colorado and a $39million pretax charge resulting from a settlement reachedwith the Minnesota attorney general's office.   Ameritech and Southwestern Bell Corp., benefiting fromstrong new-line growth and usage, are expected to post profitgains in the 10% range. In the year-earlier quarter,Ameritech had earnings of $1.06 a share, or $289.1 million,and Southwestern Bell had profit of 98 cents a share, or$295.3 million.   At Nynex Corp., profits should increase about 7% overyear-earlier results, which were depressed by a bitterstrike. BellSouth's earnings are expected to be flat. Highexpenditures and rate cuts required for new state regulatoryplans dampened BellSouth's profits. In the year-earlierquarter, BellSouth earned $404.4 million, or 84 cents ashare, and Nynex had profit of $288.7 million, or $1.47 ashare.   Profit at Pacific Telesis Group, which have sufferederosion from a new rate structure in California, areanticipated to grow 8% in the third quarter. Pacific Telesisearned $278 million, or 68 cents a share, in the year-earlierquarter. The rate plan, which was introduced last January,reduced revenue by $391 million.   Analysts' estimates for Bell Atlantic Corp. range from 3%to 8% from year-earlier levels of $344.1 million, or 86 centsa share. Bell Atlantic's results should reflect continuedcosts controls and moderate growth in minutes-of-use and newtelephone lines, says Richard Toole, a telecommunicationsanalyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner andamp; Smith Inc. Mr.Toole predicts Bell Atlantic's earnings will rise 7% to 8% inthe third quarter.   For the Bell companies, the third quarter is expected toshow steady growth of 2.5% to 3% in new telephone lines and7% to 8% in call volumes. In addition, the Bell companies'cellular communications operations are anticipated to surge50% to 60%.</TEXT></DOC>
