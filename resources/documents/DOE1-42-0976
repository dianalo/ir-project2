Administration of 0.05-0.2 mg/kg of Escherichiacoli endotoxin (E) reduced mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) to 50 mmHg,decreased systemic vascular resistance to 50% of control, and did notchange cardiac output or heart rate. Blood flow measured with radiolabeledmicrospheres to brain, kidney, spleen, and skeletal muscle was reducedduring endotoxin shock, but blood flow to left ventricle, small and largeintestine, and stomach remained at pre-endotoxin levels throughout thestudy period. Four groups of animals were used to evaluate the effectof vasopressor therapy. Vasopressors were administered starting 60 minafter E exposure, and the dose of each was titrated to increase MAP to75 mmHg. Despite the increase in MAP, brain blood flow did not increasein any group. Norepinephrine alone increased blood flow to the left ventricle.The dose of norepinephrine required to increase MAP by 20-25 mmHg duringE shock was 30 times the does required for a similar increase in MAPin animals not receiving E. The authors conclude 1) that hypotensionin the fluid resuscitated porcine E shock model is primarily the resultof peripheral vasodilatation, 2) that the vascular response to vasoconstrictorsin this model is markedly attenuated following E administration, 3) thatblood pressure elevation with norepinephrine, dopamine, and phenylephrineneither decreases blood flow to any organs nor increases blood flow toorgans with reduced flow, and 4) that norepinephrine, dopamine, and phenylephrineaffect regional blood flow similarly in this model.</TEXT></DOC>
