Demandwill grow more slowly this year. Economic growth is expected to moderatein 1989, partly due to higher interest rates, and product prices willbe slightly higher. But prices should still be low enough to stimulateincreased demand. Another year of depressed exploration and drillingactivity resulted in a further slide in U.S. production in 1988. IncreasedAlaskan production partly offset the decline, but could not prevent it.This year, increased output in California and a modest gain in crudeprices and drilling activity will slow the rate of decline, but U.S.production will still fall by about 170,000 b/d. Higher demand and lowerproduction will mean U.S. dependence on imported crude and products thisyear will be the third highest year on record. Marginally higher oilprices in 1989 will bring a small increase in U.S. drilling activity.And the expectation that gas markets will tighten could be a key to puttingmore rigs to work this year.</TEXT></DOC>
