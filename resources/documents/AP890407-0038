About 400 police cordoned off the building, and witnesses saideight staffers of the magazine were arrested.   Chen Yao-nan, a prosecutor at the Taiwan High Court, said heissued a warrant for Cheng's arrest Thursday after the publisherhad twice refused to appear for a court hearing on seditionallegations.
