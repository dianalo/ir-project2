No individualmethod could satisfactorily explain the mechanism and also could notprovide a rapid and less time consuming laboratory method for determiningrelative susceptibility of coal for spontaneous heating. The presentstudy attempts to evaluate the initiation of auto-oxidation of coalsof the Raniganj Coalfield from different horizons using DTA/TGA techniques.It has been observed that the proneness to spontaneous combustion ofthe coals of the Raniganj Coalfield varies with the stratigraphic sequence.The coal seams of the Barakar Formation are least susceptible to spontaneouscombustion; the coal seams of the Raniganj Formation (from Horizon I-VII)are moderately prone to self heating, whereas the coal seams of the Upperthree horizons of the Raniganj Formation (i.e. Horizon VIII, IX and X)are highly susceptible to spontaneous combustion. 14 refs., 4 figs.,3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
