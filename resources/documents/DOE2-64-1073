Scatteringfrom water ice, flat black paint, and Kodak white reflectance paint werealso measured. Lab simulations show that the change in albedo of thesamples show that sublimation of the water from the sample surface canhave a major effect on the albedo of a particle/ice sample in the visible.Such processing may have a marked effect on the visible albedo of cometsurfaces as well.</TEXT></DOC>
