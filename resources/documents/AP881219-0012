WBBM-TV reported late Sunday that Mrs. Byrne said she would fileher nominating petitions Monday and would announce her candidacy asa Republican.   Cook County Republican Chairman James E. Dvorak confirmed Mrs.Byrne's plans and also said he would meet Monday with anotherrumored Republican candidate, former Alderman Edward Vrdolyak, thetelevision station said.   Mrs. Byrne's home telephone went unanswered Sunday evening. Alocal radio station, WMAQ-AM, said it had talked with Mrs. Byrne onSunday and she had indicated she did not intend to file petitionsMonday, the deadline.   Meanwhile, Alderman Juan Soliz, president pro tem of the CityCouncil, announced his candidacy, saying he could bridge the city'sracial divisions better than either the announced white or blackcandidates.   Soliz joined five other Democrats _ three black and two white _in seeking the highest office in the heavily Democratic city.   The only announced Republican candidate is Edward Howlett, theson of a former Democratic Illinois secretary of State. Republicanslatemakers recently declined to endorse Howlett, saying insteadthat Vrdolyak and four lesser-known unannounced candidates havetheir go-ahead to run.   Mrs. Byrne served her term as mayor, 1979-83, as a Democrat. Inthe Democratic mayoral primary of 1983, she split the white votewith Cook County State's Attorney Richard M. Daley, which allowedthe late Harold Washington to win the nomination, and ultimately tobecome the city's first black mayor.   Washington died of a heart attack in November 1987 a few monthsafter winning a second term.   The Illinois Supreme Court has set April 4 as the date for aspecial election to fill the remaining two years of Washington'ssecond term. The Democratic primary is scheduled for Feb. 28.   Daley, son of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, again is acandidate for the Democratic nomination, as are Washington'ssuccessor, Mayor Eugene Sawyer, Aldermen Timothy Evans and LawrenceBloom, former state Sen. James Taylor and Soliz. Daley and Bloom arewhite, while Sawyer, Evans and Taylor are black.   Another black alderman, Danny Davis, dropped out of the raceThursday, saying Daley would win the election unless blacks unitebehind a single candidate. Davis pledged his support to Evans.   Soliz said he hopes for the support of other local Hispanicleaders, although he acknowledged that two other Hispanics in theCity Council have already thrown their support to Evans.   The city's population is a little more than 40 percent white, 40percent black, 15 percent Hispanic and less than 5 percent of otherraces.</TEXT></DOC>
