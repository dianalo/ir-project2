Revenuefell 5.7% to $870.1 million from $922.6 million.   The Jackson, Mich., utility concern said the earningsdecline resulted primarily from lower electric and naturalgas sales because of unusually warm winter weather. The firstquarter of 1990 was the warmest in lower Michigan in 69years, the company said.</LP><TEXT>   CMS said the warm weather reduced net income by $7.3million, or nine cents a share. This was partially offset bybenefits from the company's stock buy-back program. CMS saidit continues to buy back stock under a previously announcedprogram.   William T. McCormick, Jr., CMS chairman, said the utilitycompany is sticking with a forecast calling for 1990 earningsto outstrip the $3.80 a share achieved in 1989. But 1990 netcould be lower in the event of possible non-cash, one-timewrite-offs associated with regulatory matters arising fromCMS's Midland ventures.   In 1984 CMS abandoned a nuclear plant project in Midland,Mich., after spending $4.1 billion on construction. But CMSconverted the failed nuclear plant to a gas-firedcogeneration facility, which recently began commercialoperation. CMS has a 49% interest in the cogenerationfacility.   CMS stock rose 75 cents yesterday to close at $30 in NewYork Stock Exchange composite trading.</TEXT></DOC>
