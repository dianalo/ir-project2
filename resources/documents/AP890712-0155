Baker III said Wednesday.   Baker also disclosed at a news conference here the Western allieswould call for ceilings of 5,700 combat aircraft and 1,900 combathelicopters for each of the military alliances.   Baker said the proposal, which would limit U.S. and Soviet troopsin Europe to 275,000 on each side, would be submitted in Vienna onThursday.   That is the last scheduled session before a long summer recess.The talks are due to resume Sept. 5 in the Austrian capital.   ``By tabling this proposal, we are taking a step toward endingthe military division of Europe,'' Baker said.   In Budapest with President Bush, Baker also praised the Sovietsfor accepting a U.S. proposal for trial monitoring of astill-unfinished strategic weapons limitation treaty.   ``We think it is very good that the Soviets have respondedpositively,'' Baker said.   Despite complaints by several private American analysts that itwas a stalling tactic, Baker said trial monitoring ``might well movearms control forward rather than retarding it.''   The negotiations to cut long-range nuclear bombers, missiles andsubmarines by 30 percent to 50 percent are being held in Geneva.Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor P. Karpov said Monday heaccepted the Bush administration's argument that the two sides couldavoid misunderstandings by finishing trial weapons inspectionsbefore the agreement was concluded.   The talks between NATO and the Warsaw Pact to reduce troops,tanks, non-nuclear aircraft and armored personnel carriers areproceeding on a separate track in Vienna.   Submission of NAO's proposal before the recess gives the Sovietsand their allies nearly two months to prepare a reply.   Bush and the leaders of the 15 other NATO countries agreed at asummit meeting in Brussels in late May to make a weapons reductionproposal.   The president said at the time that an accord could be completedwithin six months to a year.   Among the ceilings tentatively adopted then were 20,000 tanks foreach side and 16,500 to 24,000 artillery pieces.   There was no numerical agrement at the summit on combat aircraftand helicopters. Setting ceilings now is not likely to end a debatewith the Soviets over the weapons, Baker acknowledged.   Negotiators will still have to grapple with deciding which planesare defensive in nature, and thereby outside bounds of the treaty.   Also, the Soviets and their allies might try to imposerestrictions on British and French planes. NATO is determined toresist.   The decision to present NATO's proposal before the talks recessedwas made last Friday in Brussels by a panel of senior NATO officialscalled the high-level task force, a U.S. official said.   Baker related the decision to move quickly on arms control toBush's visit to Poland and Hungary.   ``These efforts complement each other, and we think, together,advance the cause of a Europe which is whole and a Europe which isfree.''   He rejected, meanwhile, a Soviet contention that another Bushtimetable _ accomplishing the reductions by 1993 _ could not be met.   Baker said Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn had givenassurances that the Warsaw Pact decided at a meeting last week notto let the quest for an agreement get bogged down in details.   A senior Soviet Communist Party official said Tuesday in Moscowthat his country would not be able to make all the proposedreductions by 1993.   And he said completing the treaty within a year also was unlikely.   Lt. Gen. Viktor Starodubov said too many weapons and troops wouldhave to be cut and that Moscow had tried to explain this to the Bushadministration. The general is chief of the disarmament branch ofthe Communist party's policy-making Central Committee.</TEXT></DOC>
