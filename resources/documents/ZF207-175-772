Information technology makes it possible tofree work from the constraints of location and time.andP;  No longer is itnecessary to commute daily to a central officeplace in order to perform one'swork.andP;  Telecommuting, it has been estimated, could save thousands of barrelsof oil a day and significantly reduce the individual stress of the currentorganization of work.andP;  But what to some is the hope of the future and thesolution to many social ills, to others is the harbinger of a new era ofexploitation in an electronic sweatshop.andP;  The technology alone will notdetermine these outcomes.andP;  They will depend on the people and tasks involved,and on the structural, managerial, and cultural context in which the workgets done.andM;Using computers to work from home has been a topic of debate since the oilcrisis when the word &quot;telecommute&quot; was coined, and since individual workstations became inexpensive enough to allow wide proliferation of theequipment.andP;  Since then, there has been tremendous interest in and muchjournalistic attention to this workplace innovation.andP;  But the debate has beensubject to a number of confusions.andM;The first relates to the part of the work force and the types of tasks thatare under discussion.andP;  Routine clerical tasks and data entry, which aresubject to repetitive measures of output and are primarily performed bywomen, harken back to the evils of cottage industry and are subject tosimilar exploitation.andP;  But a different situation exists at the upper end ofthe occupational scale, where technical and professional work is nonroutine,and people are paid for their knowledge and judgment.andP;  The danger here ismore likely to be workaholism than exploitation, and the constraints are morelikely to be cultural.andP;  It is this part of the work force that is the subjectof this article.andM;A further confusion relates to the employment relationship of home-basedworkers.andP;  In the U.S.andP;  it has been estimated that 90 percent of homeprofessionals are self-employed or work as freelancers on a contract basis,and an early study of telecommuters by McClintock found only 15 percent werecompany-employed.andP;  Rank Xerox networkers and F-International in the U.K.andP;  areexamples of this independent contractor pattern.andP;  But the fastest growingpart of the home-based work force, at least in the U.S., is thetelecommuters--those who are corporate employees (Center for Futures Researchas reported in; ESU as reported in).andP;  Such arrangements can be individuallynegotiated or organized within a specific corporate unit.andP;  The ContractProgram Services (CPS) business unit of ICL Ltd., Britain's leading computermanufacturer, is an example of the latter, and serves as the site for thisstudy.andM;Finally, even within the population of organizational employees who usecomputers to work from home, there is confusion between those who use thehome in addition to a regular work week, as opposed to those who work at homeas a substitute for the office during normal working times.andP;  For example,Hughson and Goodman, in their survey of Pittsburgh firms, found that most ofthose companies that report any telecommuting say that it all takes placeafter hours: only three firms had allowed valuable employees--primarily womenwith children--to make part-time arrangements to telecommute during theregular work week.andP;  Kraut, reporting on a study in 1983-4 of employees in ahigh tech corporation who work at home, also found that most work at home inaddition to their office-based work.andP;  And Olson reports, on the basis of datafrom the readers of Datamation magazine, that only 10 percent of thesecomputer users work at home as a regular substitute for office work.andO;Primarily, therefore, telework consists of augmentation, not substitution.andO;But it is the latter pattern, which regularly combines work at home with workon site, that has the potential for meeting new individual and organizationalneeds.andP;  CPS employees fit into this pattern since they are based at home butspend anywhere from 20 percent to 70 percent of their working time at ICL orits customer clients.andP;  As their manager says, they are home-based but nothome bound.andP;  Nor are they the only ones who would like to work in thismanner.andP;  There is much evidence that when asked for preferences, many peopleexpress the desire to combine home-based with office-based work.andM;Thus, through CPS, we were able to study high-level company employees whosetechnical work is based at home but who are not confined to home, since theyspend part of their working time face-to-face with the people directlyinvolved in their projects.andP;  Further, because there is within ICL a highlycomparable group, doing the same kind of work but in the traditionaloffice-based manner, ICL provides an unusual opportunity to investigate thedifferences between home-based and office-based work for employees workingunder the same corporate umbrella and performing essentially the same tasks.andM;PREVIOUS RESEARCHandM;Most previous attempts to investigate empirically the phenomenon oftelecommuting have been based on data from small groups of pioneers or frompilot projects and other isolated informal and formal work-at-homearrangements.andP;  These early studies confirmed the segmented nature of thework-at-home option.andP;  Pratt identified three types of telecommuters: clericalwomen; managerial and professional mothers of young children; and malemanagers and professionals.andP;  Olson found that formal programs, whichprimarily involved women doing clerical work, represented a trade-off withnot being able to work at all, and were vulnerable to exploitation.andP;  Incontrast, informal arrangements in high tech companies usually involvedprofessional men with scarce skills for whom working at home was based onfree choice and a privilege.andP;  Ramsower found one group of full-timetelecommuters, primarily female, who were less satisfied with their jobs, whowere more monitored and controlled, but who had higher productivity.andP;  Hence,they were somewhat exploited by their employers.andP;  In contrast, there was agroup of part-time telecommuters, men who worked at home 2-3 days/week, forwhom the arrangement was very satisfactory.andP;  Olson and Primps found that forthe clerical group they studied there was decreased autonomy, for theprofessionals autonomy increased.andM;The distinction between clerical and professional work blurs somewhat amongthe self-employed.andP;  Gerson and Kraut (as noted in) report results of a studybased on a sample of 297 clerical workers from secretarial firms, 30 percentof whom worked at home.andP;  They conclude that the home-based workers benefittedpsychologically, but it was not possible to determine whether it was locationof work or the hours of work (less for the home-based) and the nature of thework relationship with the firm (more of the home-based owned their ownbusinesses), that accounted for these differences.andP;  Further, Christensenreports that women who have home businesses for word processing no longerconsider their work to be clerical, but think of themselves as professionals.andO;For these self-employed women, the main problem is the provision of medicalcare, dealing with isolation, lack of separation of work and home, and theconsequent danger of workaholism.andP;  But they have high autonomy andflexibility.andP;  In contrast, the externally employed who work at home face adifferent set of issues.andP;  They find that time is not fully under theircontrol, since it is subject to employer demands.andP;  Moreover, they cannotcombine their work with childcare.andP;  They tend to be paid by the hour with nobenefits, but they accept this &quot;exploitation&quot; because they want to be homeand they compare their situation to not being able to work at all.andP;  Ifcompared to office-based regular employee status, however, it is clearlydisadvantageous, and the danger of exploitation is very real.andM;The role of telecommuting in the relation between work and family has been ofinterest for a long time.andP;  In an analysis of 1980 census data, Kraut andGrambsch show that homeworkers earn less and have fewer options, and thatthose who do it tend to represent a balance between less need for income andmore need for flexibility (e.g., white married women with children).andP;  But thegeneral consensus confirms the Christensen finding that telecommuting andchild care can only be combined with difficulty.andP;  Olson and Primps also foundthat it is not the answer to the problem of how to combine work withmotherhood.andP;  The male professionals they studied, who entered the arrangementby choice, had better relations with their children, less stress, and moreleisure.andP;  For the women, in contrast, who had replaceable skills, therelation to stress was negative.andP;  Working at home is not the ideal way tocare for children, and this is explicitly stated in the suggestions to newrecruits at CPS:andM;Although CPS provides the chance to combine a career and children, we do notrecommend that they be mixed at the same time/in the same place for longperiods.andP;  Everyone's views and arrangements are different but the rosypicture of a cherub playing at the feet of a mother happily keying in herprogram is what the press always asks for and most of us never experience forany useful period of time!andM;The picture therefore is complex, and it is unlikely that the electroniccottage will soon be with us.andP;  The pros and cons are summarized inSchlosberg, in Shamir and Salomon, in a BNA Special Report, and in Olsonwhere they are augmented by data from three pilot projects comparingtelecommuters to office-based controls.andP;  The pilot projects were generallyvery short-lived and consisted of very small numbers of volunteers.andP;  They didindicate that remote work requires a different form of supervision, and thusrepresents a dramatic organizational change.andP;  Such change comes only withdifficulty, which may explain, in part, why the advantageous potential oftelecommuting is not easily translated into reality.andM;A question arises as to whether national differences affect these results.andO;For example, there are more highly celebrated success cases in Britain(including ICL) than exist in the U.S.andP;  And, within Europe, a comparativesurvey by Empirica indicates more English interest in telework thancontinental European.andP;  But there is also concern about exploitation inBritain, and the distinctive character of professional as opposed to routineclerical work pertains there to the same extent.andM;To sum up, research findings indicate that working at home with computers asan occasional but regularized substitute for office-based work, is moretheoretically useful than actually available, despite the many champions thatexist for this workplace innovation.andP;  And there is consensus, also, on thedistinction between professionals with scarce skills who make informalarrangements to spend some days at home, and women performing routineclerical or data entry tasks, paid at piece rates with no benefits.andM;What is important about the sample in this study is that it combines elementsfrom each of these occupational spheres.andP;  On the one hand the home-based CPSunit of ICL consists primarily of women who are working part time from homefor reasons of family; on the other hand, their work is professional andtheir skills are high and in high demand.andP;  Further, they are full employeesof ICL with all benefits and with the option to move back into the regularICL structure at any time.andP;  And within CPS itself, there is a managerial andtechnical hierarchy that is available to them.andP;  So they have benefits, theyhave career paths, and they have other options.andP;  They are, however, paid bythe hour for the time they actually work, and though there is a small basepay for times between projects, they are subject to some irregularity of paybased on availability of work.andM;In some ways, this method of pay can be seen as a return to more traditionalmodes, since a fee for output would seem to be more logical.andP;  But the systemalso indicates the level of trust that has built up between these workers andtheir managers.andP;  Many home-based employees are moved to piece rates becauseit seems too difficult to monitor the length of time they are actuallyworking when they are not visible to their management.andP;  In the case of CPS,self reports of time put in are accepted as the basis for pay, because of thehigh level of trust that exists within the group.andM;Study Site and SampleandM;CPS was started in 1969 in order to permit women with scarce computer skillsto continue to serve the company part time, and to keep up their skills andtheir involvement with work, while at the same time raising a family.andO;Initially they formed an hourly work force with no employment benefits anddid mainly body-shop work, taking small programming jobs home to work on inisolation.andP;  Now, this part of the company has been turned into a businessunit in its own right and is making a profit.andP;  It is managed by a full-timehome-based manager, has its own career structure with both a management and atechnical track, and is involved in a variety of projects developing systemsfor both internal and external applications.andP;  The work force is still paid bythe hour (though this is not true of its managers) and many still work parttime, but they are now eligible for all employee benefits.andP;  The unit hasapproximately 180 people in it, including its management, with about 35technical authors.andM;Out of this group, we targeted 55 people clearly in systems development whocould be compared with 51 systems developers from the Group InformationSystems (GIS) units of ICL, who are office-based.andP;  This latter groupconsisted of both employees and contractors, but all were working at companyoffice sites.andP;  In the spring of 1987, we sent everyone in each of thesegroups a detailed questionnaire, based on intensive pre-test interviews,which dealt with the way they do their work and the meaning that it has forthem.andP;  The response rate was good: 89 percent of the home-based group; 78percent of those who are office-based.andP;  It is the data from these 49home-based and 40 office-based respondents that are analyzed in this article(see &quot;Note on Method&quot;).andM;Table I shows that there are other factors besides the base location of workthat differentiate these groups.andP;  The home-based group (CPS) has more women,who are more likely to be married and to have children--a group that fits thevision of the unit when it was started.andP;  But it means that in the analysis ofdifferences, it is important to separate location from gender as aninfluencing factor.andP;  Similarly, the difference in role needs to be taken intoaccount, since there are many fewer managers among the home-based group thanthere are at GIS, where all employees are based in their company offices.andO;The design of the analysis, therefore is based on analysis of variance withthree independent variables; gender and role as well as employmentrelationship.andM;It is of interest, further, that the home-based group seems to be somewhatmore experienced, both in years of computer work and in the variety of areascovered.andP;  The differences are not large, but at least they indicate that thehome-based group is not behind the office-based employees in terms oftechnical skills.andP;  The fear that home-based workers will not be able to keepup technically is a frequently cited concern when telecommuting is discussed.andM;Another frequently voiced issue is the concern over the company loyalty ofworkers based at home.andP;  Particularly for professional work, it is argued thatthe commitment is to the work and not to the company that provides it--thefrequent job jumping in Silicon Valley being cited as an example.andP;  In thepresent case, however, this does not seem to be an issue.andP;  On the contrary,more of the CPS workers expect and would like to be working for ICL fiveyears from now than of those who are office-based, even when the freelancersare excluded.andP;  And fewer of the home-based expect to be in a business oftheir own at that time.andP;  Since the main determining factor of this differenceis gender, there is the question whether the home-based women are loyal toICL only because they perceive that they have no other choices available tothem, which is one of the aspects of exploitation feared by critics oftelecommuting.andP;  Structurally, of course, they do have choice, since they areeligible at any time to return to the regular ICL hierarchy, and they haveskills that could be marketed in a number of different ways.andP;  But most seemto have become enamored of the control over time that the CPS arrangementpermits: I don't think I would like to leave CPS.andP;  I don't think I would liketo go back full time in an office.andP;  I would look to working full time if itwere home-based ...andP;  I don't want to be tied to 9 till 5.andM;Though there undoubtedly are exceptions to this point of view, it would seemthat these women are working from home out of choice, not because of anunwelcome necessity--at least within the context of the world as they knowit.andP;  The extent to which this choice is constrained by organizational,cultural, or national constraints, is an important question and will betouched on in the conclusion.andM;In general, it seems that the control over time, rather than location, is thekey differentiating characteristic between home-based and office-based work.andO;If given free rein, this autonomy results in greater satisfaction and greaterproductivity.andP;  But it also represents the most serious barrier to thediffusion of this work option to the general professional work force, sincebeing visibly at work between 9 and 5 on weekdays is such an integral part ofour cultural assumptions about work.andP;  And yet, as Table II indicates, morethan a quarter of the systems developers in this study who work in an ICLoffice report that their most productive work times fall outside thetraditional office day.andP;  Hence, individual control over the timing of workcould have a significant potential for increasing productivity.andP;  Further, theability of the home-based to allocate work over all time periods--includingweekends--seems to be associated with a greater perception of regularity ofwork, with less of a problem about its distribution.andP;  Table II also shows thehigh proportion of both home-based and office-based employees who need quietand privacy for their work, a condition that is not easy to find in the openoffice plan of the GIS office space at ICL.andP;  There are also complaints thereof too much smoke and too little ventilation--both of which can be adjustedat home.andM;From Table II it is clear that differences in location of work change thecommunication patterns of these systems developers.andP;  The data show that it ispossible to solve the communication needs of home-based employees, and thatthere is a high potential for gain by means of allocating work according toindividually optimal times.andP;  But the fact that ICL has a profit-making unitthat has been able to benefit from this arrangement has not meant that theoption is generally available throughout the company.andP;  Indeed, one managerwho tried a number of times to make an individualized arrangement with someof his most trusted employees to spend a day or so a week at home, was toldby his personnel office that it was against ICL policy.andM;And so, the differences outlined in the rest of this article do exist at ICL,at least as they apply to the company's special home-based unit.andP;  They areimportant because they point to potential advantages of using computers towork from home as an option for the independent and cognitively intensivetasks associated with high-level technical work.andP;  But the possibility ofbenefitting from these advantages depends less on the technology than onchanges in management practices that must accompany the different ways ofworking.andP;  There is some evidence that remote work might itself be a catalystin encouraging these organizational changes.andP;  Without them, the CPS model isunlikely to diffuse more widely, and may, in fact, be unique.andP;  But thesystematic analysis of data, even if from a unique case, may, one hopes,contribute to this process of change.andM;It is in this vein that the article addresses two questions: first, whetherthere are differences in the way the work of systems development is performedby home-based and office-based workers; and second, whether this workplaceoption changes the meaning and the satisfactions associated with the work.andM;RESULTSandM;Broadly speaking, the two groups do the same kind of work, since they wereselected in this way.andP;  But, as is evident from Table III, there aredifferences within this general similarity.andP;  All respondents were asked todescribe the last completed project on which they had worked, on theassumption that the details for this project would be relatively easy toremember and that in the aggregate this information would provide a validbasis for comparison.andP;  Table III shows that the home-based group is as likelyto be working on applications for micros as for mainframes, whereas theoffice-based systems developers are primarily assigned to mainframe projects.andO;And, even when the comparison is limited to mainframe projects, thehome-based group works on smaller assignments: fewer people, shorterduration.andP;  Thus, there seems to be in the system a selective bias towardallocating smaller, more self-contained, projects to the home-based unit.andO;Such biases are highly functional.andP;  They fit into the pattern underdiscussion here which combines home-based with office-based work, and whichassumes that the allocation is based on characteristics of the task.andO;Cognitive as opposed to social tasks is a first distinction.andP;  And withincognitive tasks, there are further important distinctions based on size, onhighly specific needs of interdependence and support, and on the level ofcreativity required.andM;A further distinction between the way the work is done in the two groupsstems from a series of questions detailing the particular stages in thedevelopment of a system (from proposal through implementation) and asking whohas primary responsibility at each stage, how much involvement in each stagethe technical people have, and the main location for each stage.andP;  Generally,there are few differences between the groups.andP;  The few that do exist may besummarized as follows:andM;1.andP;  Program managers at CPS are more involved in system testing and intraining than is true at GIS: over a third of the CPS respondents report thatthe project manager is primarily responsible for system testing and trainingin contrast to less than 1 in 6 who give this response at GIS.andM;2.andP;  At the same time, home-based respondents in clearly technical roles, ascontrasted to their office-based counterparts, report more personalresponsibility for certain aspects of the task, particularly estimation ofcost and time, link testing, and training.andP;  For example, nearly two thirds ofthe technical CPS respondents claimed full responsibility for link testing,whereas less than 1 in 3 among the technical office-based reported this levelof responsibility.andM;3.andP;  Finally, as to location, the CPS group by definition did most of itsdevelopment tasks at home, the GIS group were at their offices for thesetasks.andP;  They were also primarily at their offices for system testing, firstlevel support, and system maintenance, whereas almost half of the home-basedworkers used user sites for these tasks.andM;These differences are small, but they seem to indicate that there is lessdifferentiation in roles in the home-based group than in the office-basedsystems developers.andP;  And, when the question turns to discretion and controlover how the work is done, one finds that the difference between those inmanagerial and technical roles is much larger for those who are based inoffices than at CPS, where technical people are much closer in control tomanagers.andP;  Further, these technical home-based employees perceive morediscretion and control than do their office-based counterparts, as is evidentin Table IV.andP;  It is a mode of working, therefore, that can help bring controlto the working level in organizations.andP;  But this same possibility is one ofthe key constraints to its wide diffusion, since management's fears of losingcontrol have been found to be a key barrier to the idea of allowing highlevel employees to spend some of the regular work week working out of theirhomes.andM;Thus we see that there are some differences between the home-based and theoffice-based in the way the work of systems development gets done.andP;  Thedifferences are not large, but they indicate that even relatively minoraspects of tasks can be used in considering the optimal location of work.andO;Much larger differences, however, are evident when one considers the meaningand satisfactions of work for these two groups of systems developers.andP;  And itis here that the most interesting results of the analysis emerge.andM;The Meaning of WorkandM;A number of items in the questionnaire are relevant to the meaning that workhas in the lives of these respondents.andP;  Based on a series of factor analyseson the total sample, a set of items was identified that differentiatedbetween two clusters, each of which represents a different pattern ofmeaning.andP;  The items are listed in Table V, along with the results of analysesof variance based on three independent variables: gender, role, andemployment relationship.andP;  As is evident in Table V, being home-based oroffice-based has a statistically significant association with a number ofitems, even when gender and work role are controlled.andP;  In particular, theoffice-based group places a greater emphasis on income, on success as definedby pay and promotion, and on leisure, whereas the home-based group is moreconcerned with interesting work, with keeping up their skills, and withflexibility.andP;  These differences are caught by the two patterns of meaningthat emerged from an analysis of these items.andM;Table VI, which presents these two patterns as defined by the loadings of theitems, shows that Pattern 1 is centered on interesting work, significance ofthe task, keeping up skills, and the importance of family and flexibility.andO;It is also defined by the lack of concern with income and success, and thelow importance attributed to leisure activities.andP;  The meaning of workembodied in this pattern consists of an intrinsic involvement in the actualtasks, in the context of family.andM;In contrast, Pattern 2 is centered on work and career as a key aspect ofone's life role, on the importance of status and prestige and of success asdefined by promotion and pay, and is defined also by a low concern withfamily and flexibility and with keeping up one's skills.andP;  It embodies ameaning of work based on an instrumental involvement in the context ofcareer.andM;Analysis of variance was performed on scores formed from these patterns, withgender, work role, and employment relation as the independent variables.andP;  Theanalysis shows statistically significant main effects for both patterns ofmeaning, but the results are more dramatic for the first pattern, where themultiple correlation coefficient is .65.andP;  Two of the independent variablesaccount for this effect: employment relation (beta = .40) and gender (beta =.32).andP;  CPS employees score much higher on this pattern than do theoffice-based systems developers, with the freelancers being loweroffice-based ICL personnel.andP;  And women are higher than men, independent ofemployment relation and work role.andM;For the second pattern, the overall main effects are also statisticallysignificant (P = .037), but the multiple correlation coefficient is less (R =.35), and no individual variable is independently significant.andP;  Genger is themost predictive (beta = .30), with men higher than women, followed by workrole (beta = .14) with managerial employees higher than those who aretechnical.andP;  The difference between ICL employees who are office-based (mean =+.42) and those who are home-based (mean = -.22) attentuates when gender andwork role are controlled.andP;  The means on scores from both of these patterns ofmeaning, for groups defined by employment relations, work role, and gender,are given in Table VII.andM;The table makes clear that CPS women are the embodiment of the first pattern.andO;It is among these home-based ICL employees that one finds the meaning of workin its intrinsic character within the context of family.andP;  Thus, almost 20years after its beginning, CPS still seems to reflect the values on which itwas founded.andP;  The second pattern, in contrast, which represents acareer-centered intstrumental approach to work, is most typical of the menwho are employed by ICL in standard office-based positions, particularly whenthey are in managerial roles.andM;It is also clear from the table that CPS men and GIS women deviate from theexpected picture of being high on one pattern of meaning and low on theother.andP;  disaggregation of the cluster scores into their components shows thatthese &quot;deviant&quot; groups combine elements of both patterns.andP;  In particular, GISwomen share with their male colleagues the concern with money, but they donot give work such an important place in their lives.andP;  They are somewhatyounger, more likely to be childless, and less experienced than are the menat GIS.andP;  Family seems to be a more critical concern for the freelance women;for those employed by ICL, it is the task itself that has greatestsignificance.andM;And the CPS men, though very few in number, point to a pattern that has beenfound also among U.S.andP;  telecommuters.andP;  These men share with their femalecolleagues a non-instrumental orientation (they have relatively littleconcern for money, status, or success), and are equally interested in keepingup their skills and in flexibility.andP;  But they do not have the same interestin the task itself, and their emphasis is much more on leisure andconsiderably less on family.andP;  They tend to be single and are older and moreexperienced than their female colleagues.andP;  It is as if they use their skillsto forge a leisure-oriented life-style.andP;  They may represent the forerunner ofan emergent pattern of work, based at home or in an office as the taskdemands, centered on the development of skills and on autonomy, and concernedless with career and advancement than with balance, leisure, and physicalfitness.andP;  But these are speculative conclusions, and depend on an analysis ofthe relation between the meaning of work and life satisfactions.andM;SatisfactionsandM;The final attitude question in the questionnaire was as follows:andM;Most generally, at this time, how satisfied are you with the followingaspects of your life?andP;  Please circle the number between 1 and 5 that bestindicates your level of satisfaction with each of the following (1 = not verysatisfied; 5 = very satisfied): Your job Your personal relations The balancebetween work and non-work in your life The amount of time available for yourfamily Your health/physical fitness Your sense of achievement The amount offun and pleasure in your life Your success at work Your success in thenon-work parts of your lifeandM;Analyses of variance with the same three independent variables show that theonly statistically significant mean differences on satisfaction scores occuron personal relations, balance, and the two success ratings.andP;  Women are moresatisfied than men with their personal relations, especially the freelancewomen; CPS men score lowest on this measure.andP;  Managerial respondents are moresatisfied with balance than are technical employees; this difference isparticularly evident among women.andP;  On success, CPS respondents are leastsatisfied (with both work and non-work) and freelancers are most satisfied onboth; CPS men are lowest on feelings of success with non-work aspects oftheir lives.andP;  On success at work there are complicated interactions betweensex and role, and between role and employment relation: within CPS and ICL,the managerial women are most satisfied; among freelancers, the mostsatisfied with their work are the managerial men and the technical women.andM;These first order differences, however, are less interesting than is therelation between meaning of work and satisfactions.andP;  Overall, Pattern 1 andPattern 2 scores are not correlated, by definition.andP;  Scores on the firstpattern correlate significantly with job satisfaction (r = .44, P andless; .01) andscores on both patterns are significantly correlated with a sense ofachievement (r = .30, P andless; .01 for Pattern 1; r = .27, P andless; .05 for Pattern 2).andO;But these results hide a more interesting pattern of correlations when thesample is disaggregated, as is evident in Table VIII.andM;It is the patterning of these results, rather than any of the individualfigures, that is critical.andP;  The following points emerge from this table:andM;1.andP;  For the women and those at CPS, the two sets of scores are not correlatedwith each other.andP;  For the men, at GIS and mainly when technical, there is afairly sizeable positive correlation.andP;  For these employees, the two patternsof meaning are by no means contradictory; rather they go together.andP;  Theiropposite, most likely, is a form of alienation from work in general.andM;2.andP;  Both sets of scores are correlated with satisfaction with job and withachievement.andP;  In other words, job and achievement are important andsatisfactory whether one is involved with work through its intrinsic tasks inthe context of family, or instrumentally in the context of career.andM;3.andP;  Beyond that, there are clear differences between the two patterns ofmeaning.andP;  An intrinsic involvement with work is positively correlated with anumber of other satisfactions: personal relations, balance between work andnon-work, time for family, fun and pleasure in life.andP;  Not so for theinstrumentally involved, where there is a negative correlation with one'ssatisfactions with personal relations, time for family, and health/physicalfitness.andM;CONCLUSIONandM;These results, when combined with the findings from research in the U.S.,andO;indicate that the CPS model represents what one might call a traditionalhome-based pattern.andP;  It is traditional because it is anchored in thetraditional view that women's priorities center on their families and homes.andO;As such, it may represent an example of mutual exploitation.andP;  The womeninvolved, despite their level of skills, assess their situations as highlyfavorable when compared to not working at all, but admit that there aredisadvantages in terms of position and pay when compared to working in theoffice-based mode:andM;I would not want to go back to a 9-5 job, yet I am aware that my salary isconsiderably lower than it would have been had I stayed on.andP;  I am properlypaid for the tasks I am doing, but not for my experience and career stage .andO;.  .  But of course that was my choice.andM;Nonetheless, they value this opportunity, and, as already indicated, theychoose to stay with the arrangement even when the primary motivatingcircumstances are no longer present.andP;  But the same assumptions seem not to beheld by women of comparable skills in the U.S., and hence it is not a patternthat is prevalent there.andP;  American women with equivalent skills tend to bemore career-oriented, and are not likely to want to give up the visibilitythat office presence provides.andP;  It is relevant, for example, that theexperiment by F-International to start a group in the U.S.andP;  was notsuccessful.andM;Thus the fact that Britain has more successful examples of work forces thatuse computers to work partially from home, may depend on the more traditionalsex-role expectations that are still prevalent there.andP;  The arrangement,therefore, may be seen as reinforcing the gender structure of society.andP;  Thisfact may also account for the previous observation that the principlesunderlying CPS are not filtering back into general ICL policies.andP;  Incontrast, the presence of the independent home-based networkers at RankXerox, who are primarily male, are said to have greatly influenced, or atleast to have been part of, a general change in managerial strategythroughout the company (Judkins, personal communication, and).andM;And yet, when compared with the GIS pattern, primarily among men, where workis viewed instrumentally in the context of career advancement up anorganizational hierarchy (the modal office-based pattern of work), there areclear personal advantages in the home-based model.andP;  For the GIS pattern,which is the prevalent one in the U.S., is negatively associated withsatisfactions of a personal nature.andP;  These results provide empiricalcorroboration of the personal costs associated with the way high level workis characteristically approached.andP;  They highlight the potential value ofallowing computers to free work from its traditional organizationalconstraints.andM;For even if the modal CPS model is constrained by national differences ingender roles, the few men in CPS point to an emergent pattern that is alsoevident among high level telecommuters in the U.S.andP;  Here are people withscarce skills, hired for their innovative potential, for whom life-style andbalance are more important than the single-minded emphasis on careeradvancement.andP;  For them, location and timing of work are important to theextent that they allow them to meet their personal needs.andP;  And for theorganizations that need their services, the provision of this kind ofautonomy is necessary to insure their productive commitment.andP;  Thus workingfrom home with computers for part of the regular work week may, under theright conditions, provide the perfect workplace for highly skilled employeeswhose skills and energies are needed for a productive society, but who areunwilling to have their lives controlled by the organizations that employthem.andP;  But these high-level employees must not be managed in the traditionalmode, or the advantages will be undone.andP;  Organizations must learn to valuetheir contribution and to trust their commitment, and must resist the urge todictate when and how they do the work.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
