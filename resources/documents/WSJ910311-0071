Richard P. Kusserow, inspector general for the Departmentof Health and Human Services, had charged three clinicallaboratories operated by the Hanlester Network, a generalpartnership based in Santa Ana, Calif., with paying illegalkickbacks to induce referrals from doctors who were limitedpartners in the facilities. The inspector general maintainedthe investment returns themselves constituted kickbacks.</LP><TEXT>   But even though the labs had aggressively encouraged thephysicians to send business their way, an HHS administrativelaw judge ruled the arrangements were legal because payoutswere based on the amount doctors invested and not on theamount of business they steered to the labs. He refused toban the laboratories from the federal Medicare and Medicaidprograms. The office of inspector general said it plans toappeal.   The case is the first of its kind brought directly by HHSunder a federal anti-kickback law that prohibits directpayments to physicians in return for referrals of Medicareand Medicaid patients. It is widely viewed as a test of theinspector general's broad contention that in many cases,profits doctors routinely earn from investments inhealth-care facilities are kickbacks in disguise. Hundreds ofsimilar cases are under investigation, says D. McCartyThornton, chief counsel for the inspector general. &quot;We wouldhave preferred the decision to come out the other way,&quot; hesays, but he declined to speculate about its impact on thosecases.   Patric Hooper, partner in Hooper, Lundy andamp; Bookman, a LosAngeles law firm, successfully argued the case for Hanlester.He suggests that the decision by the administrative lawjudge, Steven T. Kessel, could undermine the other cases ifit is upheld on appeal. The government's investigation stemsfrom a &quot;fraud alert&quot; Mr. Kusserow issued to thousands ofdoctors and other health-care providers in 1989, describingcharacteristics of physician partnerships and joint venturesthat are considered illegal. &quot;The kinds of things it said aresuspect are much like the facts in this case,&quot; Mr. Hoopersays. &quot;In our opinion, the decision rejects the criteria&quot; inthe fraud alert.   &quot;A lot of . . . physicians who honestly invested inhealth-care facilities will breathe a sigh of relief,&quot; addsKirk Johnson, general counsel for the American MedicalAssociation.   Thousands of doctors own interests in clinicallaboratories, outpatient surgery centers, diagnostic imagingcenters and other facilities where returns on investment,aided by the investors' own referrals, often exceed 50% ayear. Critics argue that the ventures provoke conflicts ofinterest that could allow personal financial considerationsto influence a doctor's medical judgment and compromisepatient welfare, and many doctors consider them unethical.The inspector general says evidence of much higher use ofservices at doctor-owned facilities points to ordering ofunnecessary procedures that waste taxpayer dollars.   Health-care lawyers say the federal investigation into theschemes has placed a cloud over a variety of other commonbusiness arrangements between doctors and other health-careproviders and many new ventures have been put on hold. Forinstance, hospitals often form joint ventures with doctors ontheir medical staffs to build physician offices or buyimaging machines and other expensive technology. In ruralareas, hospitals use financial incentives to recruit neededspecialists.   But because expectations of patient referrals are inherentin almost any business arrangement with doctors, lawyers saythe inspector general's reading of the law makes most of themvulnerable to prosecution. &quot;There has been much uncertaintyin the industry on what this anti-kickback statute means,&quot;says S. Craig Holden, partner in Ober Kaler Grimes andShriver, a Baltimore law firm. &quot;It goes well beyond akickback in the traditional sense.&quot;   The inspector general has drafted so-called safe-harborregulations to describe what types of ventures would escapescrutiny, but their final adoption has been delayed more thana year. In their absence, the Hanlester case offers the firstguidance to the health-care industry of how the kickback lawmight be applied, Hooper Lundy's Mr. Hooper says.   According to Mr. Kessel's 97-page decision, the threeHanlester laboratories offered doctors limited partnershipshares at $500 a share with expectations that annual returnscould range from $200 to $532 a share. But such resultsdepended on their referrals and if they didn't use the labs,it would be a &quot;blueprint for failure,&quot; they were told.SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories Inc., a unit ofSmithKline Beecham PLC, was hired to manage the labs.SmithKline processed about 90% of the tests at its ownfacilities; the rest were run at the network labs.   The decision also says that Hanlester's vice president formarketing &quot;virtually guaranteed&quot; some investors annualreturns of up to five times their investment and told someinvestors that the opportunity to purchase shares wasconditioned on their agreement to refer business to thelaboratory. She was ultimately fired, the decision says.   Based on such evidence, the inspector general argued thatthe labs violated anti-kickback law in part because they weremerely shell companies set up to provide investors highreturns at low risk.   Mr. Kessel found that as a result of the marketing vicepresident's conduct, Hanlester Network did violate thestatute, but he determined that her conduct defied companypolicy. The weight of other evidence didn't prove that adoctor's investment returns were based on patient referrals,the judge ruled, and no penalties against the labs werecalled for.   SmithKline was initially charged in the case, but it paid$1.5 million to settle in late 1989 without admittingwrongdoing. Mr. Holden of Ober Kaler, who representedSmithKline, said the decision vindicates his client'sposition that its &quot;contractual arrangements were incompliance with the law.&quot;   Congress has passed legislation that is expected to putlab partnerships like Hanlester out of business beginningnext year. Rep. Fourtney &quot;Pete&quot; Stark, (D., Calif.), whosponsored the law, says the Hanlester decision could lead torevisions to the anti-kickback law. But he plans legislationin any event that would expand the ban to other doctor-ownedventures.</TEXT></DOC>
