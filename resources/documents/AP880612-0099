(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrats agreed Sunday that theirplatform must brand South Africa a terrorist state, but bickeredover whether to call for a freeze in Pentagon spending.   Winding up a long weekend at this quaint resort, the Democrats'platform drafting committee sidestepped the question of the federalbudget deficit and whether to call for higher taxes on the rich asJesse Jackson wants.   The 16-member drafting committee left that and other issues thatseparate the Michael Dukakis and Jackson camps for another day. Ittook no votes, but will meet again sometime before the full186-member Platform Committee convenes in Denver June 25-26.   Before adjourning, the Democrats released working papers on 10issues hashed out behind the scenes by the committee staff andDukakis and Jackson campaign officials. These briefs call forappointment of a federal drug czar, adoption of the Equal RightsAmendment, ending homelessness, expanding AIDS research, andproviding advance notice of plant closings.   ``I found more areas of agreement that disagreement,'' Rep.William Gray III of Pennsylvania, the drafting panels' chairman,said after wrapping up the three-day meeting.   Those who hoped for blood ``will find the floor is clean,'' saidEleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's platform chief. But significantgaps remained between the Dukakis and Jackson stances on taxes,defense and foreign policy that could be fought out in Denver or onthe convention floor next month in Atlanta.   There was no argument, though, over the Jackson campaign'sinsistence that the platform denounce South Africa as a terroriststate.   Rep. Robert Matsui, a Dukakis backer from California, said, ``Wehave no problem calling South Africa a terrorist state, but let'sgo beyond that.''   Madeleine Albright, Dukakis's foreign policy adviser, said theMassachusetts governor favors passage of the tougher sanctions inthe Dellums-Wolpe bill that would give the secretary of state 60days to decide whether to put South Africa on a list of terroristnations with Libya and Iran.   Divisions among the platform drafters quickly resurfaced whenthe discussion turned to freezing the Pentagon budget and whetherthe United States should renounce any first use of nuclear weapons.Two AFL-CIO leaders on the panel counseled against too dovish astance.   Rachelle Horowitz, political director of the American Federationof Teachers, said the Democrats must root out waste in thePentagon, but also ``honor our treaty obligations and defenddemocratic institutions and our freedoms. I hope this platform willcall for a stable defense budget and not for any specific freezesor cuts.''   Leslie McLemore, a political science professor and Jacksonstalwart from Jackson State University in Mississippi, replied,``The defense budget is not a sacred cow. I wish to see Congresspersons and commissioners and judges and everybody run on thisplatform and feel comfortable with it, but we cannot dupe theAmerican people.''   ``As Democrats, we owe the country a serious look at freezingand cutting that defense budget and shifting those funds'' tosocial programs, McLemore said. ``I really don't think we can getout of the maze by saying to the American people that we'll dealwith it in the sweet by and by.''   Matsui defended the notion of a stable defense budget, saying,``You just can't say we're going to pull out of Korea or pull outof Western Europe in the next 12 or 24 months.''   And when McLemore urged the party to join the Roman Catholicbishops in renouncing any intention of using nuclear weapons, JamesB. Booe, the secretary-treasurer of the Communications Workers ofAmerica, rose to the defense of deterrence.   ``Over 40 years of negotiating with a lot of people ..., I'lltell you I don't tell any adversary for sure I'm not going to doanything. From a bargaining standpoint, from a diplomaticstandpoint, I want to keep them off balance,'' Booe said.   Another Jackson delegate, Janice Thurmond, an Athens, Ga.,lawyer, urged that the platform embrace Jackson's Middle East viewson self-determination for the Palestinians, but there was no replyby the Dukakis forces.   But Albright told reporters flatly that the platform will notcontain language that Jackson wants endorsing self-determinationfor the Palestinian people.   The working paper on defense and foreign policy, as well as oneon government and voting reforms, will be written later anddistributed to the drafting committee before its second meeting,which Gray said may be held June 24 in Denver on the eve of thefull panel's session.   Michael Barnes, Dukakis' chief platform representative, said,``There are differences and the differences are important.'' But hepredicted, ``We are going to leave (Atlanta) united and determinedto win that election in November.''   Barnes told reporters, ``We are not seeking floor fights.'' Hesaid Jackson has enough delegates to force a floor fight on anyissue he chooses, but Dukakis will have a large enough majority toprevail.</TEXT></DOC>
