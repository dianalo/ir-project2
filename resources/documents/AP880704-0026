STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Mohammed Hamadi goes ontrial on charges of hijacking a TWA jetliner to Beirut, he willface some of the 39 Americans he is charged with holding hostagefor 17 days.   The trial for Hamadi, a Shiite Moslem charged with murder andair piracy, begins Tuesday in a heavily fortified Frankfurtcourtroom.   Navy diver Robert Stethem, of Waldorf, Md., was shot to death bythe hijackers.   Several former hostages have been asked to testify about howtheir abductors abused them. Dozens have given depositions to WestGerman prosecutors.   ``I'm ready to go,'' said Kurt L. Carlson, a Chicago-area nativewho said he was beaten by the hijackers for two consecutive hours.   ``I feel strongly about what the hijackers did. All the beatingand the terror _ our lives were threatened every minute on thatplane,'' Carlson told The Associated Press.   ``We're very much interested in seeing justice done,'' saidGeorge Lazansky, of Algonquin, Ill.   ``It's an ongoing story. It continues every day,'' he told theAP.   Lazansky's wife, Joanne, was also on TWA flight 847 when it washijacked by gunmen en route to Athens from Rome.   West German court documents indicate that in addition to beingbeaten, many passengers were threatened and robbed. Stethem wasshot in the head and his body thrown onto the tarmac at Beirut'sairport.   Carlson and other former hostages said they were disappointedthat the trial was not being held in the United States, whereHamadi could have faced the death penalty. Hamadi faces a maximumsentence of life imprisonment in West Germany if the court convictshim as an adult. Under West German law, an adult is 21 years old.   Hamadi contends he was under 21 during the hijacking.   West Germany last year refused a U.S. request to extraditeHamadi to the United States. The decision angered U.S. officialsand caused weeks of tension between the two countries.   The differences have since been patched up, and U.S. JusticeDepartment officials have been assisting West German investigatorsand prosecutors in the case.   Court spokesman Falk Thomas said eight Americans, including sixpeople who were on the hijacked airliner, have formally intervenedin the prosecution. That means attorneys for the eight can questionHamadi during the trial.   Two of the eight are relatives of Stethem, Thomas said.   Thomas, a Frankfurt judge acting as spokesman for the Hamaditrial, said Hamadi will be tried in a specially constructedcourtroom in Preungesheim prison, where he has been held since hisarrest.   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport on Jan. 13, 1987 aftera search revealed he was carrying liquid explosives.   West German prosecutors later said his fingerprints matchedthose of one of the TWA hijackers.   Thomas said more than $7.5 million was spent constructing thehigh- security courtroom. The defendant, judges and witnesses willbe separated from the public by bulletproof glass.   After the trial opens, Thomas said a juvenile court will decidewhether Hamadi was 21 years old when the hijacking preparationsstarted.   The West German indictment lists Hamadi's birthdate as June 13,1964. Hamadi has claimed he was born in 1966.   If the court tries him as an adult and convicts him, Hamadicould receive life in prison, but if he is tried and convicted as ajuvenile, the maximum term would be 15 years. Under West Germanlaw, a juvenile is less than 18.   The court can also rule that Hamadi should be tried as anadolescent, someone 18, 19, or 20 years old.   If convicted as an adolescent, the court could sentence Hamadieither as an adult or a juvenile, depending on how mature itdecides he was at the time of the hijacking.   Thomas said actual testimony on the murder and air piracycharges is scheduled to begin in September. He said the trial wouldlast at least three months.   Hamadi's older brother, Abbas Ali Hamadi, was sentenced in Aprilby a Duesseldorf court to 13 years in prison for kidnapping twoWest Germans in Beirut in an attempt to gain freedom for hisbrother.   One of the hostages, Alfred Schmidt, was released in September.Businessman Rudolf Cordes is still being held in Beirut.</TEXT></DOC>
