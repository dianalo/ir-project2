The entertainment giant scrapped the poison pill in a pactwith a shareholder-rights group, the United ShareholdersAssociation, that had sought to put the pill on the ballot ofthe meeting, scheduled for Sept. 25 in Los Angeles. A poisonpill makes a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive.</LP><TEXT>   There is little chance that Time Warner, whose outstandingdebt and equity total nearly $20 billion, will receive ahostile takeover bid. But some shareholders could have usedthe vote on the pill to express their anger at Time Warnermanagement over the company's abortive attempt to engineer acontroversial $3.5 billion stock rights offering, which manyshareholders criticized as coercive.   Ralph Whitworth, president of Washington-based UnitedShareholders, said that in scrapping the pill, &quot;the companysaw the handwriting on the wall.&quot; At last year's annualmeeting, a proposal to terminate the pill or put it to ashareholder vote received the approval of 43% of the sharesvoted.   Mr. Whitworth added that &quot;the company's relations withshareholders deteriorated&quot; after the rights offering wasproposed in June; the offering was later replaced with a moreconventional stock issue. As a result, he said, the measurewould have received more than a 50% vote this year.   Time Warner said in a statement that &quot;after several monthsof consideration, {the board} has concluded that the pill wasa holdover from an earlier time, and in today's environment,it no longer serves a useful purpose.&quot; Jessica Reif, a mediaand entertainment analyst at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., said thecompany's decision &quot;makes sense because their annual meetingcould be very contentious.&quot;   Despite losing protection against the remote threat of ahostile takeover bid for Time Warner shares, the company'schairman, Steven J. Ross, remains protected against whatwould otherwise be a more realistic threat of a proxychallenge to oust management.   If a proxy challenger unseated a majority of the TimeWarner directors up for election in any given year, thecompany could immediately issue more common shares to holdersof its preferred stock, diluting the ownership stake ofexisting common holders. Non-voting preferred also could beconverted into voting common.   Also yesterday, Time Warner began a $700 million offer toacquire Six Flags Corp., the amusement park operator, in agroup with Blackstone Group and Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co.Lazard Freres andamp; Co. is advising Time Warner on the offer;Salomon Brothers Inc. is advising Six Flags.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          TIME WARNER Inc. plans to hold its annual meeting Sept. 25in New York.
