The latest government reports confirm that the economy wasstill contracting at a significant pace in January.Production at U.S. factories, mines and utilities dropped0.4% in January from the previous month, the Federal Reservesaid. The drop was the fourth in a row and followed a revisedplunge of 1.1% in December. Last month's slowdown leftindustrial production at late-1988 levels.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, the Labor Department said that prices chargedby producers of goods slipped 0.1% in January after dropping0.6% in December. But those declines were mostly the resultof drops in energy prices following the big increases in thefourth quarter after Iraq invaded Kuwait. Producer pricesexcluding the volatile energy and food categories -- theso-called core rate -- rose a troublesome 0.5% last month,suggesting inflation pressures haven't been completelylicked, after a 0.2% December expansion.   In a cheerful note for the economy, the December tradedeficit narrowed to $6.25 billion from November's $8.91billion. That put the deficit for the full year at $101billion, the smallest since 1983. The trade gap has beenshrinking since hitting a peak of $152.1 billion in 1987.   The drop in industrial output is consistent with otherstatistics suggesting that in January the economy was stillfully in the grip of the economic slowdown that took hold inthe fourth quarter. Payrolls dropped by 232,000 in January,retail sales continued to decline, and a survey of purchasingmanagers showed weakness comparable with the 1981-1982recession.   &quot;I think in general the evidence shows the first quarterin a fairly significant decline,&quot; said Richard Rippe, chiefeconomist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.   But few economists expect things to take a big turn forthe worse, provided the war in the Middle East doesn't dragon more than eight more weeks or so, damaging consumerconfidence. And some found hope in the fact that theshrinkage in industrial production was smaller than thedecreases in December and November.   &quot;I'm inclined to look at January as essentially being thebottom if the war ends soon,&quot; said Charles Renfro, aneconomist with the consulting firm Alphametrics. &quot;I expectFebruary to be a bit better. Inventories are very thin. Anygood news in terms of sales is going to be immediatelyreflected in more production and employment.&quot;   Norman Robertson, economist with Mellon Bank inPittsburgh, noted that at comparable points in previousrecessions industrial production was down about 6% from itspeak, while production now is down about 4%. &quot;There isweakness but no evidence of a rapid unwinding of economicactivity,&quot; he said.   The narrowing of the trade deficit in December came asexports fell 2.1% to $33.46 billion and imports sank 7.9% to$39.71 billion. Lower oil prices and less oil consumptionhelped shrink the trade gap. The petroleum-related deficitnarrowed to $4.39 billion from $5.44 billion in November.   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher hailed manufacturingexport growth of 9.7% in the year as a sign the U.S. was&quot;back producing high-quality products and winning a largershare of world markets.&quot; He noted that imports from Japanfell 4.2%, the first drop since 1975.   Increasing exports have been one of the few consistentbright spots in the economy over the past several quarters.But some analysts believe it will be tougher in coming monthsto continue big gains because some of the major U.S. exportpartners, such as Canada and the U.K., are in economicdownturns as well.   The industrial production tumble was led by a 1.8% declinein construction supplies; production in that area has beencut back 8.5% since January 1990 as a result of the ailingreal estate industry. Auto and truck production reversed thesharp declines of the fourth quarter, increasing 6.8% inJanuary after drops of 11.5% in December and 21.6% inNovember.   The Fed also reported that the percentage of factory, mineand utility production capacity in use dropped to 79.9% inJanuary from 80.4% in December.   In the producer price report, energy prices fell 2.5% inJanuary after a 4.7% decrease in December. The rise in thecore rate came from increases in prices for consumer goods.Car and truck prices were up 2%, a puzzling increase giventhe weakness in demand for autos. Prices for alcoholicbeverages jumped a record 5.9% in the month (the figuredoesn't include the increase in federal excise taxes thatwent into effect in January). Though the increases make it abit harder for the Fed to ease interest rates to stimulatethe economy, increases like those in autos and alcohol&quot;certainly aren't going to be repeated,&quot; said Mr. Rippe ofDean Witter.
