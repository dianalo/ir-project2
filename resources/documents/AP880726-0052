Talks were supposed toend at midnight.   There was no comment on whether the two sides were nearingagreement, as a news blackout was imposed by Leonard Farrell, thefederal mediator who ordered both sides to resume negotiations lastweek.   ``There's just no way to predict'' the outcome, Ms. Rhoden said.   At the opening of contract talks Monday afternoon,representatives of both the guild and the Alliance of MotionPicture and Television Producers were told they had nine hours toend their dispute.   ``At 12 midnight, we're going to be through,'' said Floyd Wood,district director for the Federal Mediation and ConciliationService, who imposed the deadline. ``I'm going to conclude thenegotiations at midnight.''   Wood also said at time that the writers and producers weremaking progress in the talks. ``Both sides are working hard,'' hesaid.   Guild sources familiar with the negotiations, speaking oncondition of anonymity, said the producers had made few concessionsin bargaining sessions Saturday and Sunday, which lasted 13 hourseach.   However, there were reports on the guild's computer bulletinboard Monday that Farrell had threatened the producers with finesfor refusing to bargain at the commencement of talks Saturday. Thethreat was confirmed by an independent guild source familiar withthe negotiations, who spoke anonymously.   Adding pressure on the producers to settle was the Teamstersunion, which said its Hollywood members may strike next week. ATeamsters strike could halt almost all film production in Hollywoodstudios.   ``I certainly hope we don't strike,'' said Earl Bush, secretarytreasurer of Teamsters Local 399. ``But there's always thatpossibility when a contract expires.''   The Teamsters contract with the producers expires Sunday atmidnight.   At issue in the writers' strike, which began March 7, arepayments for one-hour television programs rebroadcast domesticallyand all television shows rebroadcast overseas.   The strike has delayed the fall television season and has led tosweeping layoffs throughout the entertainment industry.</TEXT></DOC>
