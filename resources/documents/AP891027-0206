Garland L. Tomlin Jr., 60, was sentenced on his guilty plea toconspiracy, receiving bribes and tax evasion by U.S. District JudgeClaude Hilton in Alexandria, Va.   Tomlin could have received a 25-year sentence for taking$400,000 from Sperry Corp. and $75,000 from Honeywell Inc. inexchange for confidential information about a multi-million-dollarcontract to maintain electronic components of naval weapons.   Tomlin pleaded guilty July 14 and has been cooperating with theJustice Department's continuing investigation of Pentagonprocurement fraud, which is nicknamed ``Operation Ill Wind.''   As part of his plea agreement, Tomlin returned $385,000 from aSwiss bank account in which he kept the money.   Hilton, noting that Tomlin is now penniless, did not impose afine.   Tomlin was the third former Pentagon official to admit takingbribes in the matter. Stuart E. Berlin, a former naval engineer,and Jack Sherman, a one-time Marine Corps official, have alsopleaded guilty and been sentenced for their involvement in theprocurement scandal.   As a result of Tomlin's cooperation, Frank J. Lavelle, a formerSperry Corp. marketing executive, pleaded guilty last week tocharges he initiated the scheme by his company to bribe Tomlin.   Investigators are trying to piece together evidence to bringcharges against an unidentified Sperry executive who approved thepayments at the request of a former vice president, Charles F.Gardner.   Gardner last month was sentenced to 32 months in prison for hisinvolvement in a separate bribery scheme.   Sperry Corp. became part of Unisys Corp. following a 1986takeover by Burroughs Corp.   Tomlin has also identified a Honeywell official to whom he gavefour boxes of documents that included bid submissions fromcompeting companies, according to court papers.   The Honeywell official, not identified in the court papers, toldTomlin that the $75,000 bribe had been approved by his superiors.</TEXT></DOC>
