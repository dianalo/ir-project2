Police held back hundreds of onlookers, and a dozenultra-leftists carried signs saying, &quot;Freedom for Mielke.&quot;But the man who constructed and perfected one of the world'slargest and most efficient apparatuses of repression, ErichMielke, appeared unmoved under his brown leather hat asguards placed him on a seat behind bulletproof glass inChamber 23 of Berlin's state court.</LP><TEXT>   In a bizarre twist, the court wasn't prosecuting the84-year-old Mr. Mielke -- once the second most powerful manin East Germany, behind former party boss Erich Honecker --for crimes committed under communism. Instead, he was chargedwith the murder of two policemen in 1931, for which he wasconvicted in absentia by Nazi courts three years later. Mr.Mielke, a radical left-wing worker at the time, already hadfled to Moscow.   Present-day prosecutors have been unable to find a lawunder which to easily convict Mr. Mielke or other formerofficials of East Germany. They are nevertheless assemblingevidence for more charges against Mr. Mielke that mightinvolve support for murders committed by Red Army Factionterrorists and complicity in the deaths of more than 200people killed while trying to flee East Germany. But oneBerlin justice official said Mr. Mielke would probably bedead of old age before any case could be assembled.   So prosecutors' only hope for now is evidence from the1934 trial, which Mr. Mielke's lawyers argue didn't offertheir client a fair trial because it was a product of theNazi justice system. And with Mr. Honecker, who is also ill,holed up in the Chilean Embassy in Moscow, Mr. Mielke may bethe most senior East German official ever to be tried.   The Mielke case, no matter how it turns out, has remindedGermans of how difficult and awkward it is to prosecutealleged crimes committed under Communist rule in EastGermany. It has also left eastern Germans confused about aWestern legal system they once yearned to adopt. German lawhas been sufficient to prosecute border guards who shotwould-be escapees, but the courts haven't found an effectiveway to bring to justice those who issued the shoot-to-killorders.   While western Germans regard such cases with curiosity andbanner headlines, eastern Germans complain that their westerncompatriots don't appreciate their sensitivities. &quot;Foreastern Germans, Mielke for years was the physicalincarnation of evil,&quot; said a U.S. diplomat who served foryears in East Germany. &quot;But for western Germans, this istheater. Unification for the west meant getting an easternthorn out of their sides, but for the east it means having todeal with 40 years of history.&quot;   As theater, the trial's beginning was grisly. The firstsession lasted only an hour and a half because of Mr.Mielke's poor health. The former secret police chief onlynodded and mumbled &quot;Ja&quot; when asked to confirm that he wasErich Mielke. He didn't answer when asked for his birth date.&quot;I feel terrible,&quot; he said to a doctor who attended him twiceduring the trial when he said he couldn't &quot;stand it anylonger.&quot;   Many former East Germans had long sought revenge againstMr. Mielke. Yet even they were baffled that Mr. Mielke wasfacing charges stemming from his years as a youngrevolutionary.   &quot;This is crazy, and it's somewhat insulting to people,&quot;said Beate Herbig, a 33-year-old Hamburg surgeon who lived inEast Germany until 1984. &quot;Friends of mine who sat in prisonbecause of Mielke's laws feel that they just aren't beingtaken seriously. It doesn't address what they consider hisinjustices.&quot;   Eastern Germans, in fact, seem confused and overwhelmed bya flurry of cases involving allegations of crimes committedunder Communist rule. Among other recent events:   -- A former Dresden mayor last month was convicted offixing election results, which was a prosecutable offenseeven under East German law.   -- A Dresden interior minister is suing a doctor whodrugged him under orders from state security agents. Nocharges have been brought against higher officials who gavethe orders.   -- A popular soccer player was named as an informant forthe East German security services, the Stasi, and threeeastern German athletes on the unified German Olympic lugeand bobsled teams confessed complicity in Stasi activities.   -- Several major politicians, including some who won bylarge pluralities, have been forced to resign afterinformation leaked that they had been Stasi informants.   -- After a five-month trial, a panel of German judgesconvicted two former East German border guards of shooting afleeing compatriot in early 1989, just months before the fallof the Berlin Wall. Newspapers criticized the ruling forreaching too far down the chain of command.   &quot;I think the Mielke trial shows that you can't come toterms with the East German history in the courts,&quot; saidManfred Goertemaker, a professor of contemporary history atBerlin's Free University who is completing a book on EastGermany's state security apparatus. &quot;It is very difficult tobring before the courts what was done by the heads ofgovernments.&quot;   He also said the understaffed courts are too slow to meetsociety's need to come to terms with the past. Germanyinstead must rely more on public discussion, newspaperreports and, ultimately, the creation of a tribunal to studythe East German system and determine why it was criminal, hesaid.   Meanwhile, the decision to release Stasi files to themillions of eastern Germans on whom they were kept has turnedeastern Germans against one another. But Dr. Goertemakerargues that the process is necessary to convince easternersthat their system itself was corrupt and doomed and &quot;that itwasn't just the deutschemark that rolled over them.&quot;   Dr. Herbig, the Hamburg doctor, said she argued with herparents over the wisdom of looking at her files. &quot;For me, itwas only part of my life, and so it isn't so dramatic what Ifind out,&quot; she said. &quot;But my parents' generation wants tokeep the door to the forbidden room closed; they don't wantto be confronted with a terrible truth they might not be ableto live with later. But I am much too curious. I want to knowwhether our paranoia was worse than reality or whetherreality was worse than our paranoia.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
