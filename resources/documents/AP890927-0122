(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A thrift and two former executives have beenindicted on charges of faking defaults on $35 million worth offederally guaranteed student loans to get reimbursed by thegovernment, prosecutors said today.   The U.S. Department of Education paid Florida Federal SavingsBank about half the money before the thrift was cut off, saidAssistant U.S. Attorney Gregory Kehoe.   ``The students never had an opportunity to repay the loans,'' hesaid. ``There's no evidence the claims or proper documents wereever sent to them.''   The indictment alleges false claims for 17,000 students totaling$35 million were submitted to the Education Department in 1986 and1987.   Indicted with the St. Petersburg thrift on conspiracy, theft andfraud charges were former assistant vice presidents Robert O.Harmas, 42, of Noblesville, and James J. LaMantia, 59, of Largo.   They were arranging their surrender today.   The federal student loan program makes low-interest collegeloans. Banks and thrifts lend their own funds, and the governmentor a guarantee agency insures them against default by students.   At the time of the allegedly faked defaults, Florida Federal,formerly Florida Federal Savings and Loan Association, was thesecond-largest thrift in the Southeast and the third-largestprovider of guaranteed student loans in the country.</TEXT></DOC>
