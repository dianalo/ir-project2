The first issue is that commercial trade couldlead to military technology leakage, and to relative advances in Sovietmilitary capabilities, in instances in which widely marketed US civiliantechnology leads military applications. The second, conversely, is thatUS export controls based on military product cycles might reduce significantlythe ability of US firms to compete in international markets. Althoughthe available data base is limited, the author concludes that both problemsare significant. Commercial high-technology trade sometimes may increaseleakage risks while current export control policies sometimes damageUS competitiveness - and in some instances do so without producing nationalsecurity benefits.</TEXT></DOC>
