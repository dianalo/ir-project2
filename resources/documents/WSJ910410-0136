The personal-computer maker couldn't do much when GreatWest Life Assurance Co., acting on Mr. Gonzalez'srecommendation, replaced Compaq's personal computers withwork stations from Sun Microsystems Inc. &quot;When we saw Sun'swork stations, we knew they were more powerful than anythingCompaq had,&quot; says Mr. Gonzalez, an administration executiveat the Denver insurer.</LP><TEXT>   Not for long, if Compaq has its way. The Houston-basedcompany, which successfully challenged International BusinessMachines Corp. to win a small but profitable niche amongcorporate PC customers, now wants to be all things to allbusiness computer users. Last week, Compaq took an importantstep in that direction: It spent $135 million for a 13% stakein Silicon Graphics Inc. and another $50 million for accessto the work-station maker's sophisticated graphicstechnology.   Another piece of the strategy fell into place yesterday inNew York, when Compaq, along with 20 other companies, createdthe Advanced Computing Environment. The new 21-companyalliance, led by Compaq, software giant Microsoft Corp. andminicomputer maker Digital Equipment Corp., hopes toestablish a standard for computers based on ReducedInstruction Set Computing (RISC) technology from MipsComputer Systems Inc. By roping in other suppliers andcomputer makers, the companies hope to persuade softwaremakers to create programs for the ACE machines, which ACEmembers will need to challenge established RISC players suchas Sun Microsystems Inc. and IBM.   Microsoft said it will create versions of an advancedoperating system to work on the ACE computers and oncurrently available personal computers. Another softwarecompany, Santa Cruz Operation Inc., said it will create astandard version of its popular Unix operating software thatwill also run on old and new computers.   Although the group didn't show an ACE computer or evenoffer a complete list of technical specifications, the ACEannouncement was important for the whole computer industry.Previously, the only standards for advanced systems were seton an ad hoc basis as established players gained marketshare. Even if the group isn't completely successful, it hasset a standard with which established companies must contendand software makers must figure into their plans.   Compaq views its new ACE computers, which it will build incooperation with Silicon Graphics and expects to marketsometime in 1992, as the basis of its future productstrategy. Compaq believes that ACE will let it buildcomputers that will act like a PC but still do anything thatadvanced computers from Sun, IBM, DEC or Hewlett-Packard Inc.can do -- and do it better. Instead of cabinet-sizedmachines, the Compaq office of the future would be run byPC-sized systems, in various size combinations, that have amainframe's capabilities but also can run much of thesoftware currently available for PCs. And as in the PCmarket, Compaq hopes to benefit by being able to assemble itsnew machines from off-the-shelf parts instead of proprietarytechnology.   This strategy, a Compaq insider predicts, will increaseannual sales to about $15 billion by the year 2000 from thecurrent $3.6 billion -- and at least half those sales willcome out of the hides of advanced-computer rivals.   &quot;We're not predicting the end of IBM and DEC,&quot; says Joseph&quot;Rod&quot; Canion, Compaq's chief executive. &quot;But they'll have adifficult time com-peting and catching up.&quot;   If that sounds arrogant for a company known mainly formaking clones of IBM PCs, well, that's Compaq. Advancedcomputers may be a tough, technologically sophisticatedmarket filled with deep-pocket rivals and demandingcustomers, but Compaq believes that it has little choice ifit wants to maintain its healthy growth rate. &quot;If you don'tlead the market, you're at the whim of the leaders,&quot; saysMichael Swavely, Mr. Canion's chief strategist, who recentlytook a six-month leave for personal reasons.   With sales slowing and competition intensifying in the PCmarket, Compaq fears that its premium-price strategy isvulnerable to discounters such as Dell Computer Corp. Dellrecently slashed prices and derided Compaq as the &quot;Top of theMarkups&quot; in aggressive comparison ads. In notebook computers,some 40 new competitors, including some with machinesunderpricing Compaq's by as much as $2,000, have entered themarket this year and are threatening a stronghold thatbrought in 17% of Compaq's 1990 U.S. revenue, according toDavid R. Korus, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. InEurope, which provided more than half of Compaq's 1990revenue, Compaq expects more discounting and flat sales thisyear. The company's U.S. revenue growth skidded to just 6%last year from 24% a year earlier.   And some analysts wonder whether Compaq's clone-makerphilosophy will transfer smoothly into the advanced-computerarena. Can the company, which relies heavily on othermanufacturers to supply the guts of its machines and onindependent dealers to sell and service them, compete withmakers of mainframes, work stations and minicomputers,companies that develop much of their own proprietary hardwareand operating systems and maintain sizable in-house sales andsupport staffs?   Nobody is dismissing Compaq's chances; this is a companythat has usually been able to back up its cockiness withdeeds. Formed by a group of former Texas Instruments Inc.executives in 1982, Compaq set itself apart from dozens ofnow-forgotten PC &quot;clone makers&quot; by convincing buyers anddealers that it offered a high-quality, competitively pricedalternative to IBM's new PC. And in 1986, Compaq cemented itsreputation by building an IBM-compatible computer based onIntel Corp.'s new 80386 chip before IBM did.   Even when IBM fought back with its Micro Channel computerarchitecture and its OS/2 operating system, which weresupposed to establish a new PC standard that the clone makerscouldn't follow, Compaq wiggled out of the trap. The companyformed PC hardware and software makers into the &quot;Gang ofNine&quot; to establish its own standard in 1988. In reality, thestandard war proved little; both systems could run much ofthe existing software. However, IBM never captured as muchmarket share as many expected, and Compaq gained staturethrough its defiance of the industry giant.   By then, Compaq was already hunting for new products forits big customers. What it came up with was SystemPro, aso-called file server that, like a minicomputer, acts as thestorage and communications hub for a PC network. Thoughlacking the power of a minicomputer, SystemPro was aimed atcustomers traditionally served by the more powerful machines.   But although Compaq has declared its first venture outsidethe pure PC world a success -- it gave the company $200million in first-year revenue and new cachet among businessusers -- SystemPro has had some bumpy moments. Introduced in1989, SystemPro sold about 6,500 units last year, less thanCompaq had anticipated, according to people close to thecompany.   Some analysts cite SystemPro's problems as proof thatCompaq's collegial approach to product development might beill-suited to the advanced-computer market. Suppliers tookmonths to deliver the software needed to make SystemProfunction as the hub of a PC network. Even now, Novell Inc.hasn't been able to finish customizing its popular networkingsoftware to take advantage of one of SystemPro's main sellingpoints, its multiple microprocessors. As a result, companieswanting the Novell software usually buy a lower-priced,single-chip version of the system.   The SystemPro also showed Compaq that its 2,000 computerdealers were no match for the technical wizards that sell andsupport DEC and IBM machines. Ronan McGrath, a vice presidentof information systems for Canadian National Railways, whichowns more than 3,000 Compaq PCs, has complained that hisdealer couldn't answer technical questions about theSystemPro models. That kind of technical expertise issupplied routinely by big computer companies' engineers, butmost dealers can't afford the $80,000 or more in salary suchexperts command.   &quot;It's like running a Ferrari in Romania,&quot; Mr. McGrathsays. &quot;The performance is great, but you can't get itserviced.&quot;   In reaction, Compaq said in February that it would anoint10% of its dealers as specialists in the complex new machinesand train them. It also promised to convert another 10% ofthe dealer network later. The remaining 1,600 U.S. dealerscould sell customers a Compaq service contract.   How effective Compaq's &quot;superdealers&quot; will be againstcompetitors' staff experts remains to be seen. Avery More,president of CompuCom Inc., one of the dealers chosen,decided to replace his own IBM minicomputers with a couple ofSystemPros to show customers that the Compaq product could dothe job. But Mr. More had trouble persuading one of his ownboard members to approve the switch. &quot;You can't run a wholecompany with that, are you crazy?&quot; Mr. More recalls thedirector's saying. A letter from a Compaq executive promisinga seamless transfer eventually convinced the director.   The expertise of Compaq's dealers will become even moreimportant when the company introduces its ACE machines andseeks a share of huge new markets. Last year, some $30billion of mainframes, $28 billion of minicomputers and $7.3billion of work stations were sold, according to oneestimate. Compaq has prospered with just 3 1/2% of the $36.7billion world-wide PC market, although some experts questionwhether the company can maintain its healthy profit marginsin cutthroat markets such as work stations.   The new alliance has stirred a lot of skepticism. Sun'spresident, Scott McNealy, has denigrated Compaq'stechnological prowess. &quot;Compaq doesn't do computers,&quot; Mr.McNealy sniffs. &quot;They do handles and sheet metal.&quot;   That theme crops up repeatedly. Although Compaq has provedadept at combining existing technologies to build qualitymachines, it has yet to prove itself an innovator in computerscience. And most computer standards have emerged frominnovators, not from groups devising common-denominatorstandards that suit every company. &quot;The cowards of ourindustry don't want to be first,&quot; says Aaron Goldberg, a vicepresident for International Data Corp., a market-researchfirm, &quot;so they band together for `coop-etition.'&quot;   Companies such as Sun, IBM and DEC have broad-basedtechnical staffs that program operating software and designprocessor chips. Apple Computer Inc.'s control over itsoperating system ensured that no clone makers copied theApple Macintosh; that gave Apple an edge in competing withIBM and others.   In the past, relying on other companies for key componentshas given Compaq headaches. A shortage of Intel chips andflat-panel screens this year delayed early shipments ofCompaq's notebook computers. Compaq was even wait-listed forsome super-small hard disks from Conner Peripherals Inc.,even though Compaq owns a 21% stake in the company.   Mr. Goldberg says he doesn't see much hope that Compaq canbecome a major, full-line computer maker. &quot;How many $4billion computer companies don't have a field presence?&quot; heasks.   ---               Compaq Computer: Facing the Future                                                                                                                 Compaq's 1990 revenue by business segment                                                                                                        Desktop                                           65% Notebook                                          17% Laptop                                            11% SystemPro                                          4% Portable                                           3%                                                                                                        Source: Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.                                                                                                                      1990 minicomputer market share                                                                                                        IBM                                               19.85% Digital Equipment                                 14.95 Groupe Bull                                        5.91 Unisys                                             5.60 Hewlett-Packard                                    5.56 Fujitsu                                            5.12 NEC                                                4.45 ATandamp;T Data Systems Group                            3.45 NCR                                                3.34 Tandem Computers                                   3.27 Other vendors                                     28.49                                                                                                        Source: Dataquest</TEXT></DOC>
