The Periodical Publishers Associationadmits it's a matter of money.   They are both talking about the same thing: a proposal bythe European Commission that would essentially ban tobaccoadvertising throughout the EC's 12 member nations. With adecision by EC officials possible as early as November,lobbying groups have begun to turn up the rhetoric in a fightwhose stakes include almost $200 million in advertisingrevenue and even the survival of some magazines heavilydependent on cigarette ads.</LP><TEXT>   Leading this effort is the TCA, a British tobacco tradegroup, which has launched an ambitious ad campaign that saysthe EC proposal amounts to a &quot;draconian&quot; intrusion bybureaucrats into a issue best left to national governments.According to Michael Leach, the group's director, deepphilosophical issues are paramount over mere monetary matters-- although $63 billion of European tobacco sales also isinvolved.   The measure is an &quot;undemocratic and serious threat tofreedom of speech,&quot; Mr. Leach said at a news conference inwhich he unveiled a collection of TCA newspaperadvertisements. Almost all of them focus on a recent Canadiancase in which a judge struck down a 1988 Canadian tobacco adban similar to the EC's proposal.   One advertisement quotes the Canadian judge excoriatingthe Canadian law as &quot;a form of censorship and socialengineering . . . incompatible with the very essence of afree and democratic society.&quot; The ad accuses Brussels, theheadquarters of the European Commission, of thinking &quot;itknows what's best for British smokers.&quot; What the ad doesn'tsay, as Mr. Leach later conceded, is that the Canadian rulingis under appeal and may be overturned.   Mr. Leach insisted that an ad ban wouldn't hurt overalltobacco sales but could cost individual tobacco companiesmarket share in some countries by interfering with theirright to &quot;communicate with their customers.&quot; Another tobaccoindustry spokesman called the measure protectionist; ECmembers who favor it, notably France and Italy, havestate-run tobacco monopolies that stand to gain market shareif all other brands are excluded from advertising there, saidTony Wood of Rothmans International Tobacco PLC, a Britishcigarette maker.   Both men also asserted that the EC has yet to prove acorrelation between an advertising ban and a decline insmoking, though such a correlation is a major objective ofthe proposed regulation. Smoking has soared 60% in Norway,for example, though that nation has banned most tobaccoadvertising since 1975, according to a TCA statistic.   Action on Smoking and Health, a British anti-smokinggroup, has condemned the tobacco council's campaign ascynical and misleading. A spokesman also accused the tobaccocouncil of doctoring statistics: The group says its ownstudies show smoking actually declined 12% in Norway, ifstatistics include consumption of hand-rolled cigarettes,which are popular there.   For Britain's Periodical Publishers Association, morebread-and-butter issues are involved. In the U.K. alone,magazines, newspapers and trade publications alreadystruggling with a long recession would face an overnightslide in revenues of about #17.5 million ($30.7 million)should the ban take effect, the group says. Some specialisttitles -- trade magazines such as World Tobacco and CigarWorld, which exist almost solely on tobacco advertising --would &quot;suffer dreadfully,&quot; says Peter Dear, an associationofficial.   EC proposals to ban tobacco advertising, largely out ofhealth concerns, have been rattling around for about twoyears now. Opponents concede that, even if they derail thecurrent proposal, the matter isn't likely to go away. Thelatest version was introduced in May by Vasso Panpandreou ofGreece and the EC's commissioner for social affairs. It wouldessentially limit tobacco advertising to placards in stores;it also would prohibit tobacco companies from sponsoringathletic events tied to a product's name.   The measure is expected to come before the EC's Council ofMinisters in November. If it passes there, it will almostsurely be voted into law by the full European Parliamentbefore the end of the year. Currently, Germany, Holland,Denmark and Britain oppose the move, with all other ECnations in support. Under a Council of Ministers system thatawards votes based on country population, the coalitiontheoretically has the power to block a favorable councilrecommendation. But if the proposal were amended to addresssome of those countries' objections, some type of ban couldstill pass in November.   Three EC nations -- France, Italy and Portugal -- alreadyhave tobacco advertising bans, and those that don't have someform of voluntary control. In the U.K., for example,cigarette advertising has been banned from television since1975; a more recent voluntary agreement also banned cigaradvertising.</TEXT></DOC>
