<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-57-0893 </DOCNO><TEXT>A series of commercial FCC catalysts including old and new generationsare evaluated. Physical and chemical properties are correlated with activityand product distribution measurements obtained in a fix fluidized bedunit. It is shown that the tendency is to manufacture catalysts witha lower amount of sodium, higher ratios of SiO{sub 2}/Al{sub 2}O{sub3}, higher density and attrition resistance. Zeolite content with higherSiO{sub 2}/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} ratio enhances gasoline selectivity in thecatalysts. A study of vanadium-catalyst interaction in catalysts withdifferent matrices, shows that there is an important matrix effect interms of vanadium dilution. The mechanism of FCC catalysts deactivationby vanadium is discussed. It is shown that nickel dispersion on the catalysts,after several redox cycles, depends on the initial crystallyte size.Finally some solutions to decreasing metals effects on activity and selectivityof FCC catalysts are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
