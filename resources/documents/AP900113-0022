U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler met with Noriega'sattorneys in a closed-door session Friday, reportedly to discussthe government's interest in moving him to federal prisons inAtlanta or Marion, Ill.   Noriega attorney Frank Rubino said he would fight any effort tomove Noriega from south Florida on the grounds that it would makeit difficult for him to meet with his client.   Hoeveler refused to comment on the meeting.   Noriega is accused in a February 1988 federal indictment ofusing Panama to protect cocaine shipments heading north andsouthbound drug-processing chemicals and drug money.   Rubino said he and co-counsel Steven Kollin have been joined onthe defense team by David Lewis of New York.   Lewis, an attorney in the ``Pizza Connection'' mob case, isconsidered an expert on the federal Classified InformationProtection Act, expertise needed because of Noriega's longtimeassociation with the CIA.   The New York office of attorney Barry Slotnick, who representedsubway gunman Bernhard Goetz, issued a statement Friday saying thefirm ``has decided it does not wish to be part of the (Noriega)defense effort.''   Houston attorney Richard ``Racehorse'' Haynes also was reportedto have expressed interest in the Noriega case.   But Rubino told The Associated Press Friday that when hementioned Slotnick and Haynes to Noriega, the deposed dictator saidhe had not contacted them.   ``He told me that he is satisfied with our representation andwhoever we get,'' Rubino said. ``David Lewis is the first we'veadded, but we're going to get four or six more from all over thecountry _ the best in their fields, in their specialties.''   U.S. Magistrate Peter Palermo on Friday set bail at $1 millionfor Noriega co-defendant Daniel Miranda, 36, who is charged withflying $800,000 in drug money from Fort Lauderdale to Panama.   Miranda's attorney, Michael O'Kane, said they would be able topost the bond. But prosecutors immediately filed an appeal of theruling and temporarily blocked his client's release.   O'Kane appeared in court with a bandaged head and explained thathe had been attacked by a masked man with a crowbar in front of hishome.   Police later said they had a suspect in the attack in custody,and identified him as a person hired by a former client of theattorney's.</TEXT></DOC>
