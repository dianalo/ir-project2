Ronnie Andrea Klein told the court Wednesday that she once livedwith the mediator, businessman Rashid Mahroum, and had last talkedwith him in November 1987.   ``I had a feeling that he (Mahroum) might be involved with thekidnappings,'' she said.   Mahroum, who now lives in Lebanon, has denied any involvement inthe January 1987 kidnapping of West Germans Rudolf Cordes andAlfred Schmidt in Beirut.   Hamadi is on trial in Duesseldorf on charges of mastermindingthe abductions in a bid to win the release of his brother, MohammedHamadi, who is charged in connection with the 1985 hijacking of aTWA airliner.   The West German government last year arranged for Mahroum to actas a middleman with the captors of Cordes and Schmidt.   Federal police have said they are now seeking Mahroum forquestioning in the kidnappings.   Ms. Klein told the court she lived with Mahroum in the WestGerman city of Fuerth from April 1984 to December 1985, and thatthe two were still on friendly terms up to late last year.   ``I last spoke to him on the telephone in November,'' Ms. Kleinsaid, adding she believed he was then in Beirut.   Mahroum traveled to Beirut as a mediator in February 1987,returning with a photocopy of Cordes' passport and demands by hiscaptors that West Germany reject a U.S. extradition request forMohammed Hamadi.   ``Are you aware if he (Mahroum) has any special political orreligious convictions?'' chief Judge Klaus Arend asked Ms. Klein.   ``None that I know of,'' she testified.   West German security officials say they believe Cordes is beingheld by Hezbollah, or Party of God, a radical Shiite Moslem groupwith close ties to Iran.   Mohammed Hamadi is being held in a Frankfurt prison, awaitingtrial on charges of air piracy and murder in connection with theJune 1985 hijacking. No date has been set for the trial.   Thirty-nine Americans were held hostage for 17 days and a U.S.Navy diver was killed during the TWA hijacking.   West Germany last year turned down the U.S. extradition request,saying it would try Mohammed Hamadi instead.   In earlier trial testimony, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief ofstaff, Wolfgang Schaeuble, said the government was forced intomaking that decision, fearing for the lives of Cordes and Schmidt.   Schmidt and Cordes were kidnapped in Beirut shortly after theJan. 13, 1987 arrest in Frankfurt of Mohammed Hamadi. Cordesremains a hostage in Lebanon, but Schmidt was released in September.   Another West German, Ralph Rudolph Shray, was kidnapped on Jan.27 and remains a hostage. There have been no claims for thatabduction.   Abbas Hamadi's trial resumes March 1, with further testimonyexpected about Mahroum.</TEXT></DOC>
