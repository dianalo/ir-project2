<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-63-0500 </DOCNO><TEXT>A numerical hydrodynamics code is used to investigate two aspects of thewinds of hot stars. The first is the question of the instability of themassive radiatively-driven wind of an O star that is caused by the lineshape mechanism: modulation of the radiation force by velocity fluctuations.The evolution of this instability is studied in a model O star wind,and is found, {ital modulo} some numerical uncertainty, to lead to wavestructures that are compatible with observations of wind instabilities.The other area of investigation is of main-sequence B star winds. Attemptswere made to simulate a radiatively-driven and a pulsation-driven windin a B star, but in each case the wind turned out to be very weak. Itis argued that the pulsation-driven wind model is not likely to applyto B stars. 28 refs., 11 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
