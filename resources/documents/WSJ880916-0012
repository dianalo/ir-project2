Plaintiffs alleged in opening statements Wednesday that power forecasts in the official statements -- which contain prospectus-like material for the sale of municipal securities -- were so badly off the mark as to be fraudulent misrepresentations.    However, defense lawyers attempted to distance their clients from the questioned official statements, saying they were done by outside experts and that, in any case, the 88 utilities participating in the ill-fated nuclear project were encouraged by the Bonneville Power Authority, a federal agency, to participate in a vast plan to boost power production in the Northwest.    Albert Malanca, a lawyer for the Washington Public Utilities Group of participants in the project, told the court that &quot;It was Bonneville's idea and motivation to construct these plants.&quot; He argued as well that many regions overestimated their power needs in the days of the 1970s energy crisis.    Mr. Malanca said that during the trial he will play a 1976 tape recording of a speech by Donald Hodel, now Secretary of the Interior, urging the Tacoma, Wash., City Council to sign up for a piece of the project. Mr. Hodel was Bonneville administrator when plants 4 and 5 were launched.    Bonneville originally was a defendant in the vast federal case known as Multi-District Litigation 551, but was dismissed &quot;reluctantly&quot; by Judge William Browning on technical grounds some time ago.    Meanwhile, Chemical Bank, the trustee for the bonds, which Wednesday told the court it wasn't representing holders who bought bonds after the June 15, 1983 date that closes the official class in this case, confirmed that exclusion from its case but said it will &quot;continue to pursue whatever remedies appear to be appropriate&quot; for the so-called &quot;late buyers&quot; of the WPPSS bonds.    Chemical Bank's decision not to represent those who bought the bonds after June 15, 1983, removes that group from what's widely considered the major forum for recovery and could leave speculative holders in a lurch. However, late buyers could pursue claims in other litigation. </TEXT></DOC>
