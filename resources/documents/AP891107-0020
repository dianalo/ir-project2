Federal Reserve regulations, voluntary since June 7, becamemandatory today. In addition to advance disclosure, the law curbsmisleading advertising and other abusive practices.   ``Simple, easily understood and easily comparable informationwill be available to consumers to intelligently shop around for ahome equity loan,'' said Rep. David Price, D-N.C., chief sponsor ofthe legislation passed late last year that directed the Fed towrite the rules.   Lenders now must disclose basic cost information when borrowersmake an initial inquiry and again when the loan application isfiled.   Another provision targets deeply discounted ``teaser'' ratesthat offer borrowers a break on their first few payments before therates rise sharply. Lenders can still advertise teaser rates, butthey must give equal prominence to the interest rate borrowers willbe paying after the discount expires.   The rules forbid contract clauses permitting lenders to call inthe loan, accelerate payments or raise the interest rate at whim.   Adjustable-rate home equity loans now must be based on an indexoutside the lender's control, such as the prime rate published innewspapers, not the lender's own prime rate.   Consumer advocates were pleased with the law, sponsored in theSenate by Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., but they complained that theFederal Reserve regulations do not fully live up to their spirit.   Consumer's Union, a national organization that publishesConsumer Reports magazine, filed suit last week in U.S. DistrictCourt in Washington seeking to close what it considers severalloopholes.   The group opposes a provision in the law that requires lendersin the first pre-application disclosure to reveal only the index onwhich a floating interest rate is based, but not the margin, ordifference between the rate charged and the index.   ``We think the margin is an integral part of the cost thatconsumers need to know. We also think the legislation expresslyrequires lenders to disclose the margin,'' said attorney MichelleMeier of Consumers Union.   Bankers are generally satisfied with the law, recognizing it wasneeded to curb at least isolated abuses. But, according to DianeCasey, regulatory affairs director of the Independent BankersAssociation of America, the disclosures may swamp borrowers withtoo much detail. One provision, for instance, requires the lenderto provide a chart showing how the interest rate and minimummonthly payment would have varied over the past 15 years.   ``It gets confusing,'' Casey said. ``People don't care whathappened 15 years ago. They want to know what's happening today andwhat their payment is going to be tomorrow.''   The popularity of home equity loans has surged since the 1986tax law began phasing out the deductibility of consumer loans. Homeloans, however, are still fully deductible, including home equityloans in most instances. This year, only 20 percent of non-mortgageinterest is deductible; in 1990 only 10 percent is eligible andbeginning in 1991 none will be.   The Federal Reserve said outstanding revolving home equity loanstotaled $26.3 billion at mid-October, up from $21 billion a yearearlier and $11.7 billion in June 1987, when the agency first begankeeping track.   According to a survey of 138 lenders by the Consumer BankersAssociation, the delinquency and foreclosure rates for home equityloans were lower this year than for regular first mortgages.   But, consumer advocates have always been leery of home equityloans and say they haven't been tested during an economic downturn.Defaults could soar in a recession, they contend.   The Better Business Bureau says home equity loans should be usedonly for major expenditures such as college education, homeimprovement or for major medical expenses, not for luxuries such assports cars.</TEXT></DOC>
