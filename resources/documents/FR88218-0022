Barrett, CFC Coordinator,202-632-5564.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On December 21, 1987, the United StatesCongress passed the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government AppropriationsAct for FY 1988, Pub. L. 100-202. Section 618 of Pub. L. 100-202 includedpermanent legislation on the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC). These regulationsare proposed to comply with the provisions of the law.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>After a careful review of the proposed rulemaking, including the analysisset forth below, for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, OPM hasdetermined that this is not a major rule for purposes of Executive OrderNo. 12291, Federal Regulations, because it will not result in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in the costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>(1) Reasons Why Action by Agency Is Being ConsideredOPM proposes these new rules because President Reagan's Executive OrderNo. 12404 and Pub. L. 100-202 require OPM to promulgate rules for charitablesolicitation in the Federal workplace.(2) Objectives and Legal Basis for RuleThese regulations are issued under Executive Orders No. 12353 and 12404,and Pub. L. 100-202. The objective of these regulations is to provide asystem for administering the annual charitable solicitation drive amongFederal civilian and military employees in the CFC, and to set forth groundrules under which charitable organizations receive Federal employee donationsthrough the CFC.(3) Number of Small Entities Covered Under the RuleThe rule would apply to all human health and welfare agencies that applyto participate in the CFC.(4) Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements of the RuleThe new rules continue, for the most part, the reporting, recordkeeping,and other requirements that have been a part of the campaign operationssince the 1984 CFC. The paperwork burden is kept to the minimum necessaryto be consistent with the governing Executive orders and the statute.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980</ITAG>Sections 950.105, 950.202, 950.203, 950.204, 950.302, 950.303, 950.601,and 950.901 contain information collection requirements. As required bysection 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Office of PersonnelManagement will submit a copy of these proposed regulations to the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB) for its review.Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the informationcollection requirements should direct them to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building,Washington, DC 20503; Attention: Joseph F. Lackey.The rules assure the free choice of the employee to contribute or not tocontribute to those agencies found eligible to participate in the CFC.The Government has no obligation to subsidize these voluntary agenciesor those found ineligible to participate in the CFC. So every effort mustbe made by the responsible Federal officials to reduce the cost to theGovernment of the operation of the CFC and to shift the cost of CFC operationsto the beneficiaries of the Federal donors.These regulations in no way inhibit solicitation by any organization thatmay wish to conduct a fund-raising drive other than in the Federal workplace.Thus, there is no regulatory burden placed upon ineligible agencies. Theregulatory burden imposed on participating agencies is minimal.(5) Relevant Federal Rules Duplicating, Overlapping or Conflicting Withthe RuleThere are no duplicating, overlapping or conflicting Federal rules thatapply to the CFC.The campaign arrangements used from 1984 through 1987 were fundamentallyunsound and raised administrative costs excessively. They proved to beunduly controversial and disruptive of the Federal workplace. OPM has takenas much advantage as it can within the limitations imposed on it by thestatute, to improve the operation of the CFC. There have been no substantialchanges in compliance or reporting requirements.(7) Clarification, Consolidation and Simplification of Compliance and ReportingRequirementsAs was noted above there are no substantial changes to compliance and reportingrequirements.(8) Use of Other StandardsAppropriate alternative standards are not available that would impose lessburdensome regulations, unless the CFC was abolished.(9) Exemption of Small Entities From CoverageExemptions from coverage for small entities is not practical because manyof the eligible voluntary agencies are small entities, and exceptions forthose groups would frustrate the major purposes of Executive Order No 12404and Pub. L. 100-202: to limit participation to voluntary agencies deliveringservice and benefits to human beings and to require that eligible organizationsmeet reasonable standards of financial integrity and public accountability.As a result of the above Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, I have determinedthat the rule will not have any significant detrimental economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 950</ITAG>Charitable contributions, Government employees, Nonprofit organizations.<ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, OPM proposes to revise 5 CFC Part 950 to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 950_SOLICITATION OF FEDERAL CIVILIAN AND UNIFORMED SERVICE PERSONNELFOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO PRIVATE VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATION </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General Provisions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.101 Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.102 Scope of the Combined Federal Campaign. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.103 Structure of the Combined Federal Campaign. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.104 Local Federal Coordinating Committee. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.105 Principal combined fund organization. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.106 PCFO fee. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.107 Lack of a qualified PCFO. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.108 Preventing coercive activity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.109 Avoidance of conflict of interest. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.110 Prohibited discrimination. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Eligibility Provisions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.201 National eligibility. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.202 National eligibility requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.203 Local eligibility. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.204 Appeals. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Federations </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.301 National Federations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.302 Responsibilities of National Federations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.303 Local Federations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Campaign Materials </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.401 Campaign brochure. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.402 Pledge card. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.403 Penalties. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart E_Distribution of Undesignated Funds </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.501 Applicability. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.502 Fall 1988 and 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.503 Fall 1990 and thereafter. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.504 Review by the Director. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart F_Miscellaneous Provisions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.601 Release of contributor names. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.602 Solicitation methods. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart G_DoD Overseas Campaign </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.701 DoD Overseas Campaign. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart H_CFC Timetable </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.801 Campaign Schedule. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart I_Payroll Witholding </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">950.901 Payroll Allotment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>E.O. 12353 (March 23, 1982), 47 FR 12785 (March 25,1982), 3 CFR 1982 Comp., p. 139, E.O. 12404 (February 10, 1982), 48 FR6685 (February 15, 1983), and Pub.
