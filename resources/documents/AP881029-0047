No one was arrested during the noisy protest Friday night, whichwas sparked when Gov. George Deukmejian announced earlier in the dayhe would vote in favor of Proposition 102.   The initiative, to appear on the Nov. 8 ballot, would requiredoctors, blood banks and others to report to local health officersany patients and blood donors they reasonably feel have been exposedto AIDS or have tested positive for the deadly disease.   Deukmejian said Friday the measure would ``provide public healthofficials with the critical information they need to stop the spreadof AIDS, while maintaining the confidentiality of the doctor-patientrelationship.''   The protesters gathered in the largely gay Castro district andmarched several miles past the Civic Center.   ``The outrage was motivated by the fact that so many hundreds ofdoctors and health-care workers have said people should vote no, andevery member of the governor's AIDS advisory council is opposed to102,'' said Allen White, a leader of the protest staged byMobilization Against AIDS and other groups.   Meanwhile Friday, top officials of California universities joinedthe fight against the proposition.   ``Proposition 102 would, in our opinion, undermine sound medicaland educational programs now under way in our universities andintroduce new policies based on a misunderstanding of the publichealth and research needs of our state and nation with respect toAIDS,'' said a statement by the officials. Signers included StanfordUniversity President Donald Kennedy, University of CaliforniaPresident David Gardner, University of Southern California PresidentJames Zumberge and about a dozen other educators and medical schoolofficials.   The university officials said Proposition 102 could discouragepeople in high-risk groups from getting tested for AIDS andvolunteering as research subjects.</TEXT></DOC>
