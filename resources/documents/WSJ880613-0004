Brokers and analysts said Friday's disclosure appeared to be the most serious of a series of setbacks for the Paris Bourse over the past few months.    Some brokers said the matter could lead to the resignation of the president of the Societe des Bourses Francaises, Xavier Dupont, who is due to make a report to the stockbroker association's board today. They also said it could lead to calls for much more stringent supervision of French markets, particularly the Matif, the financial futures market that has been at the center of several recent controversies.    The loss is the biggest reported in any of the recent market scandals. Although some previous cases involved allegations of fraud, the latest disclosure is particularly embarrassing because the loss resulted from failed speculative trades by the stockbrokers' association itself -- using funds that it normally sets aside to cover losses run up on such trades by its members.    &quot;This is going to give us bad publicity, and it's embarrassing because it involves the authorities in charge of the market,&quot; one analyst said. &quot;It's damaging for our image, and London stands to gain.&quot;    Confirming rumors that had been circulating in French financial circles, the stockbrokers' association said Friday that it had experienced &quot;financial difficulties that translated into losses of less than 500 million francs&quot; on the financial futures, bond and negotiable debt markets.    Details of the trades weren't available, but brokers said they appeared to involve speculative moves that failed when stock markets around the world crashed last October and unsuccesful efforts the next two months to recoup the losses.    The association's statement blamed the losses on an unidentified &quot;former employee&quot; who it said &quot;took advantage of the lack of organization and supervision in his department to increase his positions in the hopes of setting right a situation that was already jeopardized.&quot; It didn't elaborate, nor did it say why the losses were being disclosed about six months after they occured.    Most of the funds involved came from the stockbroker association's so-called guarantee fund -- reserves it collects from members and puts aside to help cover trading losses incurred by brokerage houses or pay investors if a brokerage firm fails. The loss may have amounted to between one-quarter and one-third of the guarantee fund. But the stockbrokers' association said its capital of 1.08 billion francs &quot;isn't touched and the global security of the market isn't affected.&quot;    As one result of the disclosure, the financial futures market is expected to come under new scrutiny, as it has been involved in several previous incidents that troubled the Paris Bourse. The biggest of those was touched off in February, when the nuclear fuels company Cogema S.A. said it had lost 259 million francs on the financial futures market and alleged fraud by certain managers of its funds. A criminal complaint led to the suspension of the brokerage firm JFA Buisson from the financial futures market, although Buisson said it had subcontracted its financial futures operations to Arbitrage S.A., an investment house.    Several other firms also have reported big losses on the Matif. Late last year, the brokerage concern Ferri, Ferri, Germe was taken over by Credit Foncier de France after a loss of about 60 million francs on market-making in debt options wiped out its 1987 earnings and depleted its capital base. More recently, Banque de l'Entreprise announced a loss of about 200 million francs -- or twice its capital base -- on the Matif.    In another case, the stockbrokers' association in March suspended the brokerage firm Baudouin S.A. from trading for unspecified &quot;serious lapses of management and supervision.&quot; And last month, four employees of the brokerage concern Tuffier, Ravier, Py were charged with embezzlement.    Friday's Market Activity   Tokyo share prices closed below the 28000 level in heavy afternoon trading as investors turned cautious one day after the market's leading index surged past that mark to an all-time high.    The Nikkei index fell 151.66 to 27920.36. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section fell 8.21 to 2199.92. First section volume totaled 2.2 billion shares, down from 2.6 billion shares Thursday.    In early trading in Tokyo Monday, share prices were firmer. The Nikkei index rose 79.35 points to end the morning session at 27999.71.    London share prices settled at intraday peaks Friday for a second day as the market was led higher late in the day by a firm start on Wall Street.    At the close, the Financial Times 30-share index was up 4.5 points at 1468.2. Trading volume registered a modest 497.6 million shares, compared with Thursday's 476.5 million shares. The 100-share index finished 8.3 points better at 1849.8.    Dealers said London stocks may test post-crash highs this week or next if Wall Street and Tokyo remain strong.    Frankfurt share prices retreated across the board in moderately active trading as the day-earlier decline on Wall Street and weaker dollar prompted widespread profit-taking. But equities recovered some of their earlier losses late in the session, and most prices closed only slightly lower. The market's bullish momentum is still intact, traders said, citing a flurry of late buy orders.    Stocks closed higher in Brussels, Amsterdam and Milan, mixed in Paris and Zurich and lower in Stockholm.    Among Pacific markets, share prices closed lower in Sydney and Seoul, were mixed in Hong Kong, Wellington and Manila and were higher in Taipei and Singapore.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                  % This                             Jun 9    Jun 8        Year    U.S. ................... 248.2     249.5     +  8.2    Britain ................ 551.8     548.2     +  7.0    Canada ................. 368.8     366.9     +  5.2    Japan ................. 1289.2    1272.4     + 26.1    France ................. 364.9     357.4     + 26.5    Germany ................ 174.8     170.4     + 11.6    Hong Kong ............. 1923.0    1901.9     + 16.9    Switzerland ............ 154.3     153.0     +  9.7    Australia .............. 313.4     314.4     + 20.9    World index ............ 464.1     461.3     + 13.8</TEXT></DOC>
