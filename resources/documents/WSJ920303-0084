In the 1980s, many companies abandoned or neglectedprograms to help employees set and achieve career goals.Some, like Arvin Industries in Columbus, Ind., say they relyon &quot;mentoring&quot; by managers. But many workers want more. &quot;Theyshould put more emphasis on me as an employee, rather than onthe me who works in customer service right now,&quot; frets oneMCI worker.</LP><TEXT>   Now, counseling is reappearing at some places.Schering-Plough will announce a new program next month.Mellon Bank, emerging from what a spokesman says was no&quot;halcyon period,&quot; is developing one. Responding to pleas fromprofessional employees, Dallas-based E-Systems plans courseson career paths -- to be taught by line managers, notprofessional trainers.   Graco Inc. in Minneapolis offers after-hours careercourses that include psychological testing; Wendy's sponsorsquarterly self-assessment training workshops.                                                                                                          DO IT YOURSELF: Even employers that provide career helpurge self-reliance.   &quot;Companies in the 1990s challenge employees to takeresponsibility for their own careers,&quot; write Barry Grossmanand Roy Blitzer in Training and Development magazine. Theyrecommend that employees devise their own career plans, buildtheir own networks, tailor goals to the needs of theorganization and &quot;don't be disappointed if your manager orsupervisor isn't skillful in helping.&quot;   Uncertain business conditions decrease the chances ofsteady advances and even permanent employment within acompany, a Conference Board study notes. It urges broadeningskills through new assignments and lateral transfers. BritishPetroleum Exploration, which is cutting back andreorganizing, helps employees devise &quot;personal development&quot;plans that cover all types of opportunities -- both withinthe company and elsewhere.                                                                                                          WORK STOPPAGES fell to near record lows last year.   If it hadn't been for the one-day national railroadstrike, which idled 230,000 workers, 1991 would have been, bysome measures, the quietest year since the Labor Departmentstarted tracking strikes and lockouts in 1947. Including therailroad strike, there were 40 work stoppages, affecting392,000 workers. In all, workers were idled for 4.6 milliondays, or two of every 10,000 available work days.   Collective bargaining agreements covering 2.7 millionworkers expire or reopen in 1992. With inflation tamed, mostemployers expect to negotiate first-year wage boosts wellunder 4%, according to a survey by the Bureau of NationalAffairs, a reporting service. For unions, BNA says, wageincreases will take a back seat to job security.   Expiring this year are contracts covering more than400,000 workers at ATandamp;T, the regional Bells and GTE, as wellas 57,000 Boeing workers.                                                                                                          END OF THE TUNNEL? After three decades of decline, theunion share of total employment leveled at 16.1% last year,the Labor Department says. But it's too early to proclaim areversal in organized labor's fortunes; union membershipstill declined -- by 172,000 to 16.6 million. It held itsshare only because total employment dropped 1.1 million to102.8 million.                                                                                                          FALLING BEHIND: Lower savings and higher medical costsmean workers will have a harder time maintaining theirstandard of living after retirement, according to an analysisby Georgia State University and the Alexander andamp; AlexanderConsulting Group. In 1988, they estimated that someoneearning $40,000 would need retirement income equal to 68% ofthat, plus Social Security; now they estimate the need at77%.                                                                                                          SCHOOL COMES FIRST, Maine tells teen-agers. The state sayskids under 16 can't work part time unless they have passinggrades in most of their courses. It also limits 16- and17-year-olds to no more than 20 hours of work per week whileschool is in session.                                                                                                          U.S. HARD HATS and managers rank high in international paycomparisons.   In a study of earnings in 48 major cities around theworld, Union Bank of Switzerland found that constructionworkers last year were paid most -- $23,700 after taxes anddeductions for social services -- in Los Angeles; New Yorkand Chicago also made the top five. The highest average netpay for experienced white-collar managers was $67,100 in NewYork.   But the best U.S. ranking for public school teachers wasLos Angeles's fourth-place ($29,500); for bank tellers, NewYork's sixth ($22,300); and a sixth place for Los Angelestextile workers ($13,700). Overall, wage and salary levelswere highest in Zurich, Geneva and Copenhagen; Chicago andLos Angeles, the top U.S. finishers, came in seventh andeighth.   The average employee in Chicago must work 18 minutes tobuy a Big Mac and large fries; the average worker in MexicoCity must put in almost four hours.
