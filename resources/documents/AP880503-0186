The popular tenor was quoted Tuesday as telling Milan's Corrieredella Sera newspaper that he expects 150,000 people at the June 21performance.   Pavarotti was recently scheduled to appear in the opera at LaScala but withdrew at the last minute, blaming a cold. There werealso reports of differences between the tenor and the conductor.   In the Central Park production, American singer Kathleen Battlewill play Adina in Gaetano Donizetti's work while Marcello Panniwill conduct the orchestra of New York's Metropolitan Opera House,Pavarotti said.</TEXT></DOC>
