Lee And James B. Stewart in New York, And Caleb Solomon in Houston </HL><SO> </SO><CO> TX TWA MLP MDEST LATAM </CO><IN> TNM PET BCY </IN><TEXT>   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. said it will seek federal antitrust clearance to buy as much as 15% of Texaco Inc., increasing the pressure to radically restructure the White Plains, N.Y.-based oil giant.    The New York-based investment partnership also disclosed that it amassed a 4.92% stake in Texaco through open-market purchases some months ago. A source close to the partnership added that Kohlberg wants &quot;to open up a dialogue&quot; with Texaco's management &quot;to protect (Kohlberg's) investment.&quot;    The value of the firm's investment soared yesterday as Wall Street sent Texaco's shares to their highest level since March 1984. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the company's long-depressed common closed at $48, up $3.25 a share.    The stock's gain translated into a single-day increase of $789 million in Texaco's market value. Volume in the issue was an extremely heavy three million shares.    The entry of Kohlberg -- one of Wall Street's leading sponsors of management-led leveraged buy-outs and corporate liquidations -- opened an array of new restructuring scenarios as the U.S.'s third largest oil company prepares to emerge from bankruptcy-law proceedings April 7.    Another source close to Kohlberg said the partnership is convinced that Texaco will be dismembered and that by taking a big position, Kohlberg could put itself in line to purchase Texaco assets for Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Ltd., the nation's largest independent oil company. Kohlberg owns 39.2% of that concern.    But Kohlberg's announcement aroused glee rather than dismay at Texaco. A company statement called attention to the investment firm's history as &quot;a constructive shareholder which recognizes the importance of building value for the long term.&quot;    Texaco also was reported to be pleased that Kohlberg, rather than some corporate takeover artist or acquisition-minded oil company, was apparently the investor who snapped up large blocks of Texaco stock through the investment firm of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. late last year.    &quot;Kohlberg is not a raider,&quot; one of Texaco's relieved advisers said.    Some sources close to Texaco also speculated that Kohlberg might invite management into a leveraged buy-out, although it's unclear whether newly imposed debt covenants would prevent Texaco from mortgaging enough assets to finance a going-private transaction.    &quot;Kohlberg wouldn't necessarily break up the company,&quot; said Harvey Miller, a New York lawyer who guided Texaco through its tumultuous yearlong bankruptcy proceeding. &quot;Texaco might be able to work out a restructuring with Kohlberg.&quot;    Texaco has launched its own restructuring campaign involving sales of about $3 billion of assets. That planned restructuring is far more modest than the overhaul or outright sale of Texaco that many analysts and investors have been clamoring for.    Although Texaco sources said Kohlberg's investment also could help shield the company from its largest shareholder -- the acquisitive Carl C. Icahn, who owns 14.8% of Texaco's common -- Mr. Icahn yesterday welcomed Kohlberg's action. Mr. Icahn said he will try to persuade the partnership to back the slate he has nominated for the five board seats that are up for election at Texaco's annual meeting, tentatively scheduled for May. There are a total of 14 seats on the Texaco board.    &quot;It's always good for shareholders when a large, sophisticated investor buys a stake in a company,&quot; Mr. Icahn said in an interview.    Despite widespread Wall Street speculation to the contrary, one of the individuals close to Kohlberg denied that the firm was &quot;teeing up&quot; the company for a takeover attempt, by Kohlberg or by anyone else. Kohlberg's announcement that it will seek clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act to buy as much as 15%, the source said, was caused by Texaco's &quot;changed situation.&quot;    As part of its emergence from bankruptcy-law proceedings, Texaco will settle for $3 billion the $11 billion court judgment that Houston-based Pennzoil Co. won against it in a dispute over the ownership of Getty Oil Co. Before several recent developments, &quot;there was no need&quot; for the antitrust filing, the individual said.    Kohlberg's announcement shocked traders and others who had been hearing many other parties mentioned as possible suitors. The name of Kohlberg &quot;never came up,&quot; said J.D. Robb, head of institutional trading at Lovett Mitchell Webb andamp; Garrison in Houston.    Kohlberg joins an all-star list of big, aggressive investors already counting on either a sale or a restructuring of Texaco -- or trying to buy a piece of it. Investor T. Boone Pickens of Amarillo, Texas, also has sought antitrust clearance to buy some of Texaco, although his intentions are unclear; Husky Oil Ltd. wants to buy Texaco's interest in its Canadian affiliate; and Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Venezuela have considered buying an interest in Texaco's refining and marketing assets.    Kohlberg's entry throws more fuel on the long-simmering fire. &quot;The company's in play,&quot; said Michael Lamb of Wealth Monitors Inc. &quot;This just increases the pressure on (James W.) Kinnear,&quot; Texaco's president and chief executive officer. Kohlberg already has invested something between $360 million and $500 million in Texaco stock, Mr. Lamb said, and &quot;that's a pretty hefty equity position for them to take in anything.&quot;    At first glance, breaking up an integrated oil company might seem hard to do. But Texaco has launched the process itself with its proposed asset sales, and &quot;it could be carried further,&quot; said Thomas Tracey, a consultant with Greenwich, Conn.-based John S. Herold Inc.    One model for a split-up could be a plan under consideration at Texaco's former nemesis, Pennzoil, which is considering splitting itself along its three main lines of business: oil production, oil refining and a major non-oil operation.    Leveraged buy-outs have pervaded U.S. industry but would be new to the oil industry.    &quot;With a company Texaco's size, it would certainly be a first,&quot; Mr. Tracey said. He said John S. Herold currently values Texaco at $64.70 a share, or a total of $15.7 billion.    One obstacle to a traditional leveraged buy-out could be a settlement framework that Texaco recently established with the Internal Revenue Service to try to settle a tax claim of as much as $6.5 billion. Texaco assured the IRS it would keep its ratio of debt to total capitalization below 60%. It currently is about 52%.    But David Batchelder, a consultant to Mr. Pickens's Mesa Limited Partnership, said: &quot;Covenants can always be amended. A typical type of (Kohlberg) transaction is feasible.&quot;    Mr. Batchelder wouldn't comment on what Kohlberg's entry meant to Mr. Pickens as a Texaco investor. He also declined to say whether Mr. Pickens has bought additional Texaco shares since receiving Federal Trade Commission clearance recently to do so.    Kohlberg, which oftens acts as a white knight, or friendly suitor that helps companies fend off hostile takeovers, is one of the top leveraged buy-out firms in the U.S., with investment funds totaling about $6.2 billion. The firm has carried out more than 30 management buy-outs with a total value exceeding $30 billion. It is best-known for taking Beatrice Cos. private in 1986 for $6.2 billion, the largest such transaction to date.    In a leveraged buy-out, a company is taken private in a transaction financed largely by debt. The debt is ultimately repaid from a company's cash flow or from sales of assets. </TEXT></DOC>
