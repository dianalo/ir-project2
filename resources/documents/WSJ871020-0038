The action generally was greeted warmly by America's friends in the Persian Gulf, who are providing an unusual amount of military help. And it was calculated carefully enough to receive widespread support in Congress, where skittish members might have questioned a more provocative or dangerous raid.    But it is likely the Iranians will retaliate, forcing the U.S. into a decision about still-tougher measures. And despite the initial enthusiasm for yesterday's strike, there remains a strong underlying uneasiness in Congress, which could yet curb the administration's high-profile strategy in the gulf.    Just before dawn yesterday, U.S. warships destroyed an oil platform that Iran had converted to a military command center for its operations in the Persian Gulf. The strike, on a platform 75 miles south of the Iranian coast, is being presented here as a moderate, measured military response, but one that demonstrates American willingness to respond with more force to further Iranian provocations.    The attack ended a wave of questions over the weekend about whether the U.S. would retaliate or turn the other cheek. While the White House sought yesterday to assure the world America isn't seeking a confrontation with Iran, American officials also went out of their way to assure doubting friends and foes that the U.S. is in the gulf to stay.    &quot;The cost of not doing this would be to demonstrate clearly to allies and foes that Iran is free to go ahead and attack shipping,&quot; Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.    And President Reagan, in a meeting with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, yesterday responded to the crown prince's pleas that America remain in the gulf by saying, &quot;You can count on me.&quot;    Indeed, with allied navies also plying the gulf, with Mideast nations from Israel to Saudi Arabia in full support and with the American public still widely inclined to view Ayatollah Khomeini's regime as villains, America seems to have the basic ingredients for keeping the heat on. The cautious American attack drew praise from European allies and Arab friends.    Rep. Dante Fascell, Democrat of Florida, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called the U.S. action &quot;carefully calculated from a military and policy standpoint.&quot; Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah told President Reagan, &quot;I woke up this morning to very good news, the news of your attack on an Iranian platform.&quot; Britain's Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said, &quot;The U.S. is fully entitled to take military action in exercise of its rights of self-defense in the face of the imminent threats of further attacks.&quot;    Just what Iran will do next, no one is predicting. But U.S. officials underscore that Iran's options are largely the ones already being utilized -- attacks on ships and terrorism. &quot;I don't think they are holding back a great reservoir of capability,&quot; Secretary Weinberger said. &quot;They've been in the terrorism business all along.&quot;    Regardless of what course Iran chooses, Mr. Weinberger, who opposed the stationing of U.S. troops in Lebanon, insists the U.S. has a force in the region large enough to achieve America's goal of maintaining free navigation of the Persian Gulf. America has 29 ships in the region and her allies have a total of 37.    While the Soviets have sought to capitalize on U.S.-Iranian tensions to shore up Moscow's relations with Iran, hardly anyone believes the Soviets will become militarily involved in a conflict with the U.S. In the past, Moscow has stood aside while the U.S. bombed Libya and while Israel bombed an Iraqi reactor site and shot down scores of Syrian jets over Lebanon. &quot;Their record of coming to the defense of their allies is not good,&quot; says an administration official.    The Soviets yesterday denounced the U.S. attack as adventurism designed to distract attention from Irangate. &quot;The confrontation is a fact now,&quot; said a Tass commentator. &quot;What is obvious is that the latest military adventure will not bring political dividends to the American administration.&quot;    But the preoccupation in Moscow seems to be with the coming visit of Secretary of State George Shultz and the prospects of winding up a medium-range nuclear-arms agreement that would pave the way for a superpower summit before the year's over.    Beyond Iran's limited military capabilities and Moscow's diplomatic preoccupation, the U.S. has one other thing going for it that was absent in Vietnam and Lebanon. For the moment, the U.S. enjoys the support of all the Persian Gulf Arabs. As a result, recognizing the enemy is much easier than in Vietnam or Lebanon, where internal conflict raged around the U.S. troops. Arab nations, particularly Saudi Arabia, are laying aside their fright at involvement with America and assisting U.S. forces with unprecedented -- if self-interested -- cooperation.    &quot;Paradoxically, the more we talk about it, the less support we'll get,&quot; said Mr. Weinberger in refusing to detail assistance to American military forces in the region. However, other administration officials say the Saudis are allowing U.S. Air Force tankers to use Saudi air bases to refuel AWACS radar planes in the air to assure constant surveillance of both the northern and southern Gulf. In addition, the Saudis are flying their American-made F-l5 jet fighters as air cover in the Gulf. And Kuwait, whose tankers the U.S. reflagged, is providing oil for American ships that escort those Kuwaiti tankers.    Despite all this, the U.S. is proceeding cautiously. Administration officials say they don't want to alarm or alienate Congress, European allies or the Arabs. Nor do they want to so engage the U.S. that Arab nations simply sit back and let America do the security job for them. This is one reason, officials say, that the U.S. chose not to attack the Iranian Silkworm batteries on the Fao peninsula, a dot of Iraqi territory that Iran captured two years ago and from which it has been firing missiles at tankers.    An attack on occupied Iraqi territory might have been seen as a tilt toward Iraq, and the U.S. is trying to maintain the posture that it is neutral in the Iraq-Iran war and is simply in the gulf to keep open shipping lanes. Beyond that political rationale, Fao also poses a greater military risk for attacking Americans because it is heavily defended with anti-aircraft guns and possibly by Hawk missiles -- which Iran ironically received from the U.S. in an arms-for-hostages exchange.    As a result, the Chinese-made Silkworms and the military threat they represent remain despite yesterday morning's attack.    And Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Said Rajaie-Khorassani, said Iran will continue its attacks on Kuwaiti ships because Kuwait is an ally of Iraq, which has been fighting Iran for eight years.    Unlike other recent brushes with Iran, the latest U.S. strike was designed to avenge an attack rather than deflect one. While the action was in response to an Iranian strike, it fell outside the classification of pure self-defense that had been applied to earlier uses of force in the gulf.    Implicit in the action was a warning that if Iranian attacks on U.S. flag ships continue, tougher steps will follow. In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one converted for military uses -- the U.S. also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's economic lifeline. &quot;We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting capabilities,&quot; said Anthony Cordesman, a Washington-based Mideast expert.    The Reagan administration's approach to the Persian Gulf still faces sizable obstacles in Congress. While lawmakers praised the combination of resolve and restraint in the latest U.S. action, they remain vexed by the open-ended nature of American military operations in the gulf. Rep. Fascell, who praised yesterday's attack, nonetheless expressed anxiety about the long-term. &quot;It's a dangerous situation,&quot; he said. &quot;It's no longer a question of imminent hostilities. We're in the middle of hostilities.&quot;    Indeed, prolonged confrontation between the U.S. and Iran would fuel congressional impatience. Says Mr. Cordesman: &quot;The great risk the Reagan administration faces is being nibbled to death while the cost still rises and nothing happens at the United Nations,&quot; which is pushing for a cease-fire.    Congressional approval of the reprisal hasn't slowed the push to put curbs on the U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf. Today, the Senate begins consideration of a measure that would require more reporting to Congress on military actions in the gulf, and lay out procedures under which Congress could vote to end the current military role there.    The administration staunchly opposes the bill, as well as other proposals that would allow Congress to halt Navy tanker escorts in the gulf. Secretary Weinberger warned last week that restrictions by Congress would undercut administration efforts to show resolve. &quot;Sometimes it comes across as an uncertain trumpet call,&quot; he said. &quot;What we have in this country -- and the world is beginning to recognize it -- is two governments,&quot; Congress and the executive branch.    ---         Recent U.S. Military Involvement in the Gulf   Dec. 1986 -- Reflagging proposal.
