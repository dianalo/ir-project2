Thomas Golisano, president and chief executive officer, said.    Mr. Golisano said results for the latest period ended May 31 were hurt by a 40% increase in sales staff, which currently has 200 members. In the year-ago quarter, the company, which provides automated payroll accounting to small businesses, earned $1.3 million, or 16 cents a share.    Revenue for the latest fourth quarter rose about 24%, Mr. Golisano said in an interview, to an indicated $17 million from $13.8 million a year earlier.    For fiscal 1987, the company expects to post a 23% earnings increase to about $5.1 million from $4.2 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 26% to about $63.9 million from $50.7 million.    Mr. Golisano said he was &quot;very comfortable&quot; with analysts' forecasts that Paychex earnings -- aided by a lower tax rate -- will jump 50% in fiscal 1988. He noted that the costs involved in expanding the company's sales force have already been absorbed and that similar additions aren't contemplated in fiscal 1988.    The executive said the company's fiscal 1988 tax rate will fall to 40% from 50% in fiscal 1987. He said the higher tax rate cost the company five cents a share in profit in fiscal 1987.    Paychex's fiscal 1988 capital expenditures will fall to about $4.5 million from $5 million in fiscal 1987. The company said it plans to open four to six new offices next year. It currently has 60 offices in metropolitan areas.    At the end of fiscal 1987, Paychex had about 70,200 clients, up from 56,900 a year earlier. Mr. Golisano also said he expects an addition of 20% to 25% more next year. The increase in fiscal 1987 includes about 900 clients obtained through Paychex's second-quarter purchase of closely held Purchase Payroll of Minneapolis. </TEXT></DOC>
