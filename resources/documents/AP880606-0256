The April 18 decision grew out of a suit filed by an animalrights group against a local angling club that staged a fishingcontest two years ago.   The object of the contest was to see which fisherman could catchthe most pounds of fish in two days. After the fish were pulled inand weighed, they were returned to the water.   Civil court Judge Horst Brinkmann based his decision on testimonyof experts called in to determine whether or not fish feel pain whenhooked, and if they suffered during the time they were out of thewater.   Four wildlife experts testified that an increased heart rate andlabored breathing of the fish after they were pulled from the waterindicated that they feel pain.   Brinkmann ruled that fishing was permissible if fish were quicklykilled, and if they were caught for useful purposes. But he addedthat simply catching the fish to weigh and determine which anglerwas more skilled subjected the creatures to unusually crueltreatment.   ``Fishing contests serve no further purpose than to determine whohas won,'' Brinkmann ruled.</TEXT></DOC>
