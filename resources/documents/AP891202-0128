Ballot-rigging and noisy protests marred Saturday's election,the first national vote since the Nationalist Party lifted martiallaw in 1987. The Nationalists have been in power since they fled toTaiwan following their 1949 defeat by the Communists in China'scivil war.   Thousands of angry opposition supporters surrounded governmentoffice buildings in several cities Saturday, calling for recountsor demanding results. Protesters broke windows in one city.   The opposition Democratic Progressive Party claimed ``a greatvictory.'' With nearly all districts reporting, the Nationalistswere garnering 55 percent of the popular vote, while the oppositionwon about 35 percent. The rest went to independents.   ``This is a setback for the Nationalists,'' said Ting Tin-yu, aprofessor of sociology. ``They should have won 70 percent of thevote.''   In 1986 elections, the opposition won 22 percent of the votecampaigning as independents.   In the Legislature, the opposition won 21 seats; it previouslyheld 12. The Nationalists won 72 seats.   In county and mayoral races, the opposition won six posts, upfrom two before the vote. The Nationalists won 14. One seat went toan independent allied with the opposition.   An opposition faction that ran on an illegal campaign platformcalling for an end to Taiwan's claim on the Communist mainland alsopolled well.   In a slap in the face to the Nationalists, opposition candidateYou Ching, a 47-year-old legislator, won the executive post inTaipei county, President Lee Teng-hui's hometown. The president isa symbol of Nationalist power.   ``One of the first things I will do is demolish the NationalistParty headquarters,'' You told a screaming crowd early Sunday.``Then you will be able to walk your dogs on the property.''   Tens of thousands of revelers celebrated You's victory in whatthe local press had dubbed ``the war of the century.'' Supportersset off firecrackers and danced in the streets near You's campaignheadquarters in Panchiao.   In all, 722 candidates ran in the legislative, mayoral andcounty executive races.   The Nationalists cannot lose power in the election. The 256-seatLegislature and the electoral college are dominated by elderlyNationalists elected for life on the Chinese mainland in the late1940s and frozen in office to support the party's claim to be thelegitimate government of all China.   Still, the vote is of tremendous importance to thishighly-industrialized island of 20 million, considered an economicmiracle in Asia.   It is the first nationwide election since 38 years of martiallaw ended in 1987 and the first with a legal opposition. It is alsothe first to witness relatively open debate on taboo subjects suchas Taiwan independence and official corruption.   At least 20 of 32 candidates of the opposition New CountryAlliance won seats in a variety of races. One member, the widow ofa dissident who committed suicide to avoid prosecution for hisbeliefs, got one of highest vote tallies in the election. Anotherwoman, whose husband has been jailed on political charges, also won.   Even those who chose Nationalists had a preference for change.   Two crusading reformers from the liberal wing of the partypolled the highest in southern and northern Taiwan.   Reports of vote-buying were widespread. Several voters in Taipeion Saturday told The Associated Press they had been paid for theirvotes. The going rate was $19.   Earlier Saturday, the Central Election Commission said it wasinvestigating scores of reports of voter intimidation and ballotrigging.   Angry crowds surrounded county government buildings in Nantou,in central Taiwan, and Tainan, in the south, alleging that theNationalist Party had cheated at the polls. In Tainan, a rowdycrowd smashed windows at the government offices and beat governmentofficials, the state-run radio said.   Protests also broke out in Taichung in central Taiwan. Butpolice said crowds dispersed Sunday.   The opposition's campaign focused on the local, rather thanlegislative, elections.   ``We cannot control the Legislature, but we can rule the localgovernments,'' said Democratic Progressive Party Secretary-GeneralChang Chun-hung.   In Kaohsiung, Hsu Hsiao-dan, a dancer who used nude pictures ofherself as campaign posters, lost. She ran a campaign based on loveand freedom.</TEXT></DOC>
