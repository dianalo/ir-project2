Emulsion is introduced into thelower destabilizing area and is destabilized therein. The emulsion isthen passed upwardly into the central filtering and coalescence area.The dispersed phase of the emulsion is attracted to the coalescence materialin the form of droplets, and as the emulsion continues to pass upwardlytherethrough the droplets grow in size. During passage of the emulsionthrough the filtering and coalescence material, matter in suspensionis filtered from the emulsion. Within the flotation and separation areais located a separation device including a lower convergent portion andan upper divergent portion. The emulsion passes through this separationdevice, and the coalesced dispersed phase separates from the floats onthe top of the dispersion phase within the area of the upper divergentportion of the separation device. The separated dispersed and dispersionphases are separately withdrawn. The pressure difference between theupper and lower sides of the coalescence material is measured as an indicationof the degree of retention of matter in suspension within the coalescencematerial. When this pressure difference reaches a predetermined maximum,indicative of clogging of the coalescence material, the normal separationby coalescence treatment of the emulsion is stopped, and a washing liquid,which may be the emulsion to be treated, and a gas are introduced intothe destabilizing area and passed upwardly through the coalescence material,thereby removing the matter in suspension. 1 figure, 3 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
