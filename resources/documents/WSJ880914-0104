Yet at the center of the lake one is surrounded by more than 9,000 surface acres of water that spread into countless bays and coves. And then there is what lies below the peaceful surface. Typical of man-made reservoirs, Wilson's depths reach to 90 feet and hold an infinite number of submerged hangouts for a finite number of fish.    For a novice angler it's somewhat intimidating, like looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack. For Bruce Coate it's just another day on the job, but it's a job he does very, very well.    Mr. Coate was on the water but a few minutes when he said, &quot;Here they are . . . let's catch some of 'em.&quot; Lines were lowered and soon one of the rods sprang to life, and a shiny bronze walleye was swung on board. Not much later a chrome-colored white bass was pulled in, followed by several more walleyes.    So it went for the rest of the day as Mr. Coate cruised the fertile waters of the lake, stopping his boat only where he knew there were fish. And with but a few exceptions, every spot yielded fish.    Mr. Coate explained that there were several reasons for the memorable trip. Probably the most important reason was a small, cigar box-sized object that sat on the dash of his boat -- his locator.    &quot;My job as a guide would be all but impossible without one,&quot; said Mr. Coate, who spends close to 300 days a year on the lake that sits just a few miles from his home in Wilson. &quot;Not having one out here on the water would literally be like not having my eyes.&quot;    But thanks to those &quot;eyes,&quot; and knowing how to use them, Mr. Coate's clients annually pull thousands upon thousands of fish from the fertile lake, from delicate crappie to muscle-straining striped bass.    Yet it is doubtful if the thousands of sport fishermen who use such units are aware that the locators they love were first made for a far more serious form of underwater scanning.    &quot;The first sonar units, what fish locaters really are, were conceived in World War II,&quot; said Allan Tarvid, a spokesman for Lowrance Electronics, one of the nation's top fishing electronics companies. &quot;The navy invented them as a way of finding enemy submarines.&quot;    Yet in 1957, a fisherman named Carl Lowrance, the founding father of Lowrance Electronics, saw the benefit that a small and more compact sonar unit could offer fishermen.    The original locators, which were portable, were little more than a calibrated dial with flashing lights that showed the depth of the water and any objects (of the finned variety, it is hoped) that lay below the surface.    According to Mr. Tarvid, the concept was remarkably simple. &quot;Fish locators, like all sonar, are really nothing more than an electronic transmitter, a receiver and a stop watch,&quot; he said. &quot;Signals are sent down, and they bounce back when they strike something. The length of time between the two tells you how far away that object is.&quot;    Locators have evolved a lot over the years. In Mr. Coate's bow sits one of the original &quot;flasher&quot; units. On the side of his dash rides his beloved graph recorder, a combination of a slow moving scroll of paper and a stylus that moves as a vertical blur, etching the solid contours of the lake's bottom and the inverted arcs of fish. Properly adjusted and with a little practice it's easily understood and extremely accurate.    Above his steering wheel sits the new kid on the block, a liquid crystal graph that shows its discoveries in clusters of black dots, not to mention such digital information as boat speed, water temperature and maximum depth. Fancier models also will indicate fish with colors or flashing lights.    Such advances in locator technology have affected more than just angling. Law enforcement agencies now have a much faster way to find drowning victims or sunken boats lying hundreds of feet below the surface.    And in October, 1987, Lowrance Electronics assembled a side-by-side fleet of boats to sweep the depths of Scotland's Loch Ness in search of the fabled monster. The mystery remains. The search turned up nothing concrete, yet there was one inexplicable, huge object graphed that disappeared before underwater cameras could be aimed at it.    But for most tasks it's called upon to perform, the modern locator does a fine job; some would say too fine a job. Critics claim that accurate underwater vision has taken much of the sport out of fishing and that what was once a game of leisure and luck has turned into a strict science.    Messrs. Coate and Tarvid disagree, completely. &quot;Ours is a society with less and less time for recreation,&quot; said Mr. Tarvid. &quot;What locators do is cut down on wasted time and allow people to spend more time catching fish.&quot;    However, it's not as easy as it sounds. &quot;It's one thing to find fish and another thing to find the right species of fish and then find ones that will hit,&quot; said Mr. Coate. &quot;I can usually tell because I've had a lot of experience, but many people end up wasting their time on fish that simply aren't feeding. It's more frustrating knowing they're there but won't bite than it is not knowing if they're there or not.&quot;    ---   Mr. Pearce is a free-lance outdoors writer based in Manhattan, Kan. </TEXT></DOC>
