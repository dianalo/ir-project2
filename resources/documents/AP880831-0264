The plot is a demographic one: A two-decade bulge of Americansof homebuying age will have passed through the economy, leaving astill large but substantially smaller demand for lower-pricedstarter homes.   Among the characters affected will be developers, lenders,builders, trades people, brokers, materials suppliers and investors.   ``They have no choice but to accept that notion and accommodatethemselves to the reality,'' says James Wooten, chairman of LomasMortgage USA, and publisher of U.S. Housing Markets, a subscriptionnewsletter.   The latest analysis by the newsletter, whose surveys and studiesare widely accepted in the housing industry, offers thesedemographic-based projections:   _Annual household formations gradually will fall to less thantwo-thirds of the 1984-1987 average.   _Private housing starts will average no more than 1.4 million ayear for most of the decade of the 1990s, compared with 2 millionin 1977 and more than 1.7 million in the years 1983-1985.   _New housing will shift inexorably toward higher price ranges,reflecting the greater affluence and grander lifestyles of olderbuyers.   _Traditional rental apartments aimed at younger tenants will bein less demand. Says Wooten: ``Landlords will need to findinnovative products to attract households in higher age brackets.''   _Housing targeted for older Americans _ those retired orplanning retirement _ will be find a growing market.   Wooten butresses his conclusions with immutable demographicevidence:   In 1975, for example, nearly 40 million Americans were in their20s, the primary market bracket for apartments and starter homes,while only 23 million were in the ``move-up'' category of 35 yearsto 44 years.   By the end of the century the numbers will almost flipflop, withmore than 43 million individuals in the age 35 to 44 bracket, whilethose in their 20s will have contracted to 34 million.   These numbers portend a development that might also have aserious impact on those who currently own homes and are relying onthe equity in them to finance their retirements.   Wooten describes the potential phenomenon in this way:   ``As America ages, as the middle-years cohort climbs the ladderfrom first moveup and thence to second, third and fourth, the lowerrungs will be holding fewer and fewer potential buyers.   ``The homes being left behind will be offered to a dwindlinglist of prospects.   ``Thus, in overall terms, the existing-home market willgradually evolve into a buyers' market, beginning in the lowerregions of the price spectrum.''   The situation Wooten describes doesn't dictate lower prices, nordoes it mean that prices cannot increase.   But it strongly suggests that the sharp price increases of the1970s and 1980s will be, by the year 2000, a thing of the past.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thursday Sept. 1</NOTE></DOC>
