 The commercial composition areacontinues to be characterized by rapidly changing technology.andP;  Not only havemost of the vendors moved to new, standard platforms, but some are gettingready for their next-generation product.andM;For example, Magna Computer unveiled an early version of an interactive pagelayout program running under Microsoft Windows, while Bestinfo previewed itswork on an OS/2 version of its Wave4 system.andM;Who's in, who's out.andP;  It was difficult to categorize some of the products inthe demonstration area, so a few general-purpose items are include in thissection.andP;  We aren't including products aimed specifically at newspaper andmagazine markets; they will be incorporated in our discussion of thoseSeminar topics in our next issue.andP;  Similarly, vendors oftechnical-documentation systems will be covered next time.andP;  All discussion ofnon-Roman languages, which includes some composition capabilities, appears inthis issue in the section immediately following this one.andM;We call attention also to the April issue of the Seybold Report on DesktopPublishing, where developments in the desk-top field will be covered.andM;Highlights.andP;  Among the highlights of the composition systems covered in thissection are:andM;* Magna's interactive layout.andP;  In a radical departure from all of itsprevious products, Magna takes full advantage of a mouse, menus and icons toprovide good facilities for planning pages and flowing text interactivelyinto frames.andP;  The speed and precision of its traditional systems ispreserved, though, by providing a text window for editing, plus ready accessto x/y coordinate values for placing elements.andP;  The operating environment isWindows.andM;* Bestinfo's next wave.andP;  One of the notable features of Bestinfo's OS/2version of Wave4 is interactive handamp;j of text in the editing window.andP;  OS/2 alsoshould relieve the problems associated with the existing version's residingwithin 640K of memory.andP;  Bestinfo also showed new interfaces to some high-endcolor scanners.andM;* WYSIWYG version of Tomahawk.andP;  Also in the OS/2 ring is Deucalion ResourcesGroup, which demonstrated a WYSIWYG version of its composition module.andM;* Mac version of Postsstrip.andP;  Ultimate Technographics introduced a Macintoshversion of its Poststrip program for configuring pages for printing plates,but it didn't show the forthcoming version of its composition softwarerunning within OS/2.andM;* Composing music with A-R.andP;  Sun Microsystems hosted this interestingapplication using Sun platforms and PostScript output devices.andM;* Designitek software unbundled.andP;  In addition to demonstrating a new revisionof software, Itek Graphix announned that it is unbundling its Designiteksoftware to allow it to drive PostScript machines besides the company's ownIGX 7000 PS.andP;  The software-only price is an attractive $2,495.andM;* More interfaces from G.O.andP;  Graphics.andP;  G.O.andP;  Graphics is making it possiblefor Compugraphic customers to drive PostScript machines from Their MCS,PowerView and Integrator workstations.andM;* Enhanced graphics for Epics.andP;  Varityper demonstrated better facilities forhandling PostScript graphics within its Epics system, including the abilityto access prerasterized graphics from disk.andM;* Purdy on the bandwagon.andP;  Peter Purdy's Panda system now supports PostScriptoutput besides Ace.andM;* New Bedford features.andP;  Bedford demonstrated its latest software revisionwith new features for handling multiple pages and boxes.andM;* Demand printing with CCH Computax.andP;  This company specializes in high-speedprinting using mainframes, PCs and laser printers.andM;Bedford works on magazine pagesandM;Bedford reported that it has delivered several PC-based Pro-Type systems andit has started to open dealerships in the U.S.andP;  The first of these is Hawkeyand Associates in Chicago, a member of the Gang of Ten.andP;  Bedford anticipatessetting up about a dozen eventually.andP;  They will be selling a prepackagedversion of the software, driving PostScript imagesetters, and providingapplications training as needed.andM;On the software front, Bedford demonstrated the latest version of ProType onthe Macintosh and the PC.andP;  New features focus on enhancing the ability toproduce magazine-tyep pages interactively.andP;  (This is separate from theoptional batch pagination program that has been a key feature of Bedfordsystems over the years.)andM;Where it used to be necessary to create each page as a separate file,dividing multipage text files accordingly, it is now possible to createmultiple pages on one screen and cause text to flow from one page to thenext, as if they were all on the same page.andP;  Running headers and footers canbe handled by duplicating blocks and placing them appropriately.andP;  Multipleelements can be grouped and operated on.andM;One type of work that should be suited to the new capabilities is creatinggraphics such as flowcharts.andP;  When graphic elements--boxes, arrowheads,etc.--are created, they can be specified as growing with other elements or asmaintaining their original size.andP;  Using the former capability, the operatorcan easily scale a flowchart to fit a desired amount of space without havingto manipulate each element independently.andM;Bedford has simplified the generation of rules for this kind of illustrationby assigning keys to ruling functions.andM;Bestinfo shows OS/2, new interfacesandM;Bestinfo showed an early version of new editing software that will run underOS/2.andP;  (Bestinfo's products have been all DOS-based so far.)andP;  The new editorwill be available during the summer.andP;  Very early versions of other OS/2programs were also shown.andM;The new editor, WordWright II, is more integrated with the compositionsoftware than the current WordWright product.andP;  (WordWright is a customizedversion of XyWrite, from Xyquest, whereas WordWright II is a Bestinfo-writtenprogram.)andP;  WordWright II has a &quot;counting-keyboard&quot; mode that recomposes textas you type, letting you see true line endings and hyphenations at all times.andO;This is helpful for people who are editing material to fit a specific numberof lines.andP;  A status window shows your current horizontal and verticalposition in the file, among other data.andP;  Line numbers can be displayedalongside the text file.andM;The package will have a full set of editing functions, including search andreplace, a &quot;go to line#&quot; command, macros, and keystroke playback functions.andO;When Bestinfo coding is to be added to the file, this is done through aspecial window, not by simply typing in the characters.andP;  This allows checkingfor proper codes and proper pairing of delimiters.andP;  The codes can bedisplayed or suppressed (shown as diamond-shaped characters) in the file.andM;A lot of customization is possible with WordWright II.andP;  We were told it wouldbe possible to mimic a user's existing editor of choice, such as WordPerfector Microsoft Word, under the new package.andM;The program runs under OS/2's Presentation Manager, which means that featuressuch as standard mouse interface, pull-down menus, window resizing, andmultiple windows (either tiled or overlapping) are supported.andM;WordWright II will also serve as the editor for the OS/2 version ofPageWright.andP;  In PageWright, editing of text that is already on the page isdone in a window with a special editor.andP;  WordWright II will replace thateditor under OS/2.andM;New interfacing possibilities.andP;  For pages containing graphics, Bestinfo'sWave4 system has always driven PostScript output devices.andP;  It has usedPostScript commands for text and line art but has bypassed PostScripthalftoning and substituted its own halftoning approach.andM;Now, Bestinfo is able to drive non-PostScript raster devices as well.andP;  Thishas required the addition of three facilities.andP;  One, called Collage, issoftware to handle contone images in Iris, Scitex or Hell formats.andP;  Thesecond, called the Bestinfo RIP, is a software rasterizer for text fonts andline art.andP;  The third, called Publisher's Image Conversion Software (PICS),converts among a variety of file formats and copies images to and from9-track tape.andP;  (PICS was introduced in February; the other two packages wereintroduced at the Seybold show.)andM;Together, the three products can output full pages to raster devices fromIris, Scitex and Hell via 9-track tape.andP;  Two versions of the page are sent: acontone file and a line-art file.andP;  These are merged by the output device.andO;Bestinfo users with devices from these vendors (including, in the Hell case,rotogravure cylinder engravers) can now create output files without goingthrough a high-end color system.andM;The Bestinfo RIP is available now and costs $25,000.andP;  It requires an80386-based computer with 4 MB of RAM and a '387 numeric coprocessor.andO;Collage will be available in April and can be added to a Bestinfo system for$20,000.andP;  PICS costs $10,000.andM;CCH Computax: network printingandM;Along with Laser Resources Inc., CCH Computax showed the PC version of LaserResources' demand document production and printing system.andP;  The product,DecNet PC, uses a PC running Ventura Publisher to provide a customizedproduction service via 17 production and distribution points throughout theUnited States, using the DocNet high-speed network.andM;Text files are senmt to one of the network's mainframes, where data isconverted for output on one of the high-speed laser printers at the variouslocations.andP;  The converted file can be stored either on the PC or at theremote site.andM;Although the original DocNet concept using mainframes has been in existencefor three years, the PC version is a more recent collborative effort betweenLaser Resources and CCH Computax.andP;  The conversion software itself is theresult of a joint effort between CCH and Xerox using the Freedom of Presssoftware RIP from CAI.andM;Pricing is according to the volume of use and the total number of pagesproduced, whether they are duplex or simplex, stapled or comb-bound and soon.andP;  The intention is to provide an efficient cost-effective means ofproduction with a rapid turnaround for corporate applications and thoseapplications where the run is relatively short.andP;  Hence, prices typicallyrange from $5,000 to $75,000.andP;  As an example, a 33-page document, GBR boundwith a 72-hour turnaround, would likely cost $8.90 (withouth postage) at thelowest of volumes (5,000), so this is a worst-case price.andP;  The software alsoincludes various reporting functions for the user, available through the 800customer service number.andP;  The cost of calls to the headquarter sites is theresponsibility of the user, however.andM;This is a new product for CCH, which says that it is looking to extend itscurrent base of 2,000 customers for its primary product, a tax form printingservice.andP;  Sales will be direct, but eventually the company would like to sellthis service through retail channels.andP;  A PostScript version of the productsis expected next autumn.andM;DRG shows WYSIWYG TomahawkandM;Deucalion Resources Group unveiled a WYSIWYG display for its Tomahawkcomposition module available to other vendors to incorporate in theirsystems.andP;  Running under OS/2, it can be run in split-screen mode to show themonosized text and editable commands in one window and the WYSIWYG view inthe other, or it can run as a full WYSIWYG screen.andP;  We'll have details in ournext issue, where we discuss the newspaper market--the place DRG has foundits most prominent customer.andM;G.O.andP;  Graphics serves CG marketandM;G.O.andP;  Graphics introduced several products, aimed primarily at the market ithas served through most of its history: add-on capabilities for Compugraphicsystems.andM;One-for-All.andP;  One-for-All is an interface that takes data from any of AgraCompugraphic's recent front-end systems (MCS, PowerView and Integrator) andconverts it to drive output devices compatible with PostScript orHewlett-Packard's PCL Level 5.andP;  It comes with a small control panel with aLCD display and touchpad.andP;  Selectable options include the desired emulator,number of copies, font layouts and loading, and page size and orientation.andM;The operator loads the correct font widths into the front-end system.andO;One-for-All comes with the width tables for the basic 35 PostScript faces andlayout mapping that performs automatic pi character replacement.andM;Because the HP LaserJet III with PCL 5 uses CG fonts, Compugraphci systemscan use their regular width tables.andP;  One-for-All provides the font mapping tothe printer.andP;  Additional fonts are available from HP and may be downloaded oraccessed from a cartridge.andM;G.O.andP;  says the program will be able to provide CG users with additionalPostScript functionality not available within the standard CG machines byembedding commands in text files.andP;  For example, rotation, tints, graphics andcolor will be supported.andP;  The price of One-for-All hasn't been set.andM;Connections.andP;  A disk conversion program running under MS-DOS, Connectionsconverts DOS application files to a disk compatible with the MCS, Integratoror PowerView and vice versa, without the use of the Compugraphic ACICommunications interface.andP;  From a PC-compatible platform, users also candisplay directories from CG disks and copy, delete and rename files, as wellas format disks for CG systems.andM;Connections, which costs $ 895 as a standalone product and is available as anoption to G.O.'s Deskset Design, also contains a user-definable datatranslation feature.andM;Modular Proofing System.andP;  The new feature for the MPS is the ability to drivethe four-page-per-minute Canon LBP-4 print engine at a resolution of 600 X300 dpi.andP;  It supports the MCS and PowerView front ends.andP;  MPS sells for $5,995with a PC RIP but without the Canon LBP-4 engine or $6,995 with the RIP andprinter.andP;  A kit with a control panel, an SDLC board and a laser video board,which can be used with any engine, costs $3,995.andM;Multi-Link 401.andP;  An output-sharing device called MultiLink 401 allows up tofour Deskset workstations to output files in background mode to oneCompugraphic 8000 series or 9000 series typesetter.andP;  It consists of afour-port automatic multiplexor switch box, a system controller, backgroundspooling software, a print buffer and cabling.andP;  It costs $1,995.andM;Itek Graphix unbundles DesignitekandM;Itek Graphix Composition Systems, which currently is undergoingreorganization by its parent, A.B.andP;  Dick, demonstrated its Designitek systemin the booth of Sun Microsystems.andP;  It was running on a Sparcstation.andP;  Thebiggest news is that Itek Graphix has unbundled the software and is lookingfor OEM distribution channels.andP;  Also new was software release 3.0, whichfocuses on better pagination features and color.andM;The price for the designitek software alone if bought from Itek is anattractive $2,495.andP;  It outputs PostScript code only, but until now has beenbundled with Itek's own IGX 7000 PS typesetter, which is based on LEDtechnology and a film transport that moves incrementally each time it imagesa stripe of data.andM;For text applications, the quality attainable with the 7000 has never beenquestioned.andP;  But for some of the special effects that are characteristic ofPostScript--such as fine tints--the 7000 must be kept in pricise alignment toavoid irregularities such as banding.andP;  How long it remains in alignmentdepends to a large extent on the individual user.andP;  Offering the softwarealone, to drive any PostScript recorder, will make it possible for people notsatisfied with the 7000's quality to try something else.andM;Release 3.0.andP;  One of the most notable additions to the program is a set ofhelp screens, accessed by selecting a topic from a list.andP;  Some help messagesare graphically illustrated.andM;Also new is widow/orphan control.andP;  The operator specifies how many linesconstitute a widow and how many an orphan.andM;Loose lines are now flagged by placing a tint behind them, similar to the newfeature in Aldu's PageMaker 4.0.andP;  This is a nice approach to letting the userknow that the maximum permissible interword space value has been exceeded.andM;For page layout, there is a new feature to aid in setting up standard pages.andO;The operator can specify the number of columns, the size of the gutterbetween columns, any rules that are to appear on the page, and the pagemargins.andM;New features for color include support for importing images in TIFF, Gem IMG,PCX and Sun raster formats.andP;  Imported images can be cropped, sized(proportionally or anamorphically), rotated and moved.andP;  It is possible togenerate a black-and-white print of color images.andM;As we reported previously, spot color is available also.andM;Reorganization.andP;  Regarding its recent reorganization by A.B.andP;  Dick, ItekGraphix said the plan to close down the manufacturing effort in Nashua, NH,is proceeding.andP;  The facility will remain open to house customer support,administration, telemarketing and engineering operations, we were told.andM;Magna unveils layout programandM;In one of highlights of the demonstration area, Magna rolled out its solutionto laying out pages interactively: PageComp.andP;  Interestingly, Magna choseWindows as its operating environment, rather than OS/2.andP;  PageComp iscompatible with most common monitors, including VGA nd 12&quot; and 19&quot; screens.andM;PageComp uses a mouse, icons, windows, dialog boxes and most of the other&quot;new-wave&quot; features previously believed to be anathema to Magna'sprogrammers.andP;  It is based on the premise of drawing containers interactivelyand flowing text in by command.andP;  Containers can be any shape--round,rectangular, irregular, etc.andP;  The program doesn't provide interactive editingof text on the page.andP;  All text editing takes place in a monospaced-textwindow that performs approximately the same functions as the standard Magnatext screen, except that the window can be scaled to any size.andM;The Seminars served as a preview of the new system.andP;  The formal announcementwill occur at Type-X later this week.andP;  Magna said it is the first in a seriesof new products, but it didn't elaborate.andM;Display.andP;  Magna has designed its own icons that can be displayed or removedfrom the screen by the operator and that simplify many of the functionsotherwise accessed through menus.andP;  One icon represents the &quot;dashboard,&quot; whichbrings up a status indicator that can be moved anywhere and left open.andP;  Itdisplays the current x/y location of the cursor if a frame is selected.andO;Other icons are used for handamp;j of a file, magnifying the screen, creatingframes for text or graphics, and so on.andM;As with other Windows applications, multiple windows can be openconcurrently.andM;The screen displays text in actual sizes, scaled on the fly using technologyobtained through a licensing agreement with DigiFont.andP;  The current librarycontains 200 faces, including bold, italic and bold italic versions, whichcan be assigned by the user to provide the closes match to output fonts.andO;After characters have been scaled to a particular size and width, they arecached in memory for later use.andP;  The size of the cache depends on the amountof memory in the machine.andP;  Magma recommends a 4-MB '386 computer for bestperformance.andP;  (The program itself uses less than 500K.)andP;  We hope Magma willsupport Adobe ATM and Microsoft TrueType technologies when these becomeavailable for Windows.andM;The text window display the same monospaced characters as the standard Magnacomposition system.andM;Page Layout.andP;  A page setup box governs page size, number of columns, guttersize and rules, whether it is a left or right page, etc.andP;  Layouts can bestored in a library for later use.andM;Frames can be created visually with the mouse or by specifying the frame'sparameters.andP;  Grids in all common measuring systems can be used to snap framesor other elements to.andP;  When frames are created, they are specified ascontaining either text or graphics.andP;  Frames can be regular shapes(rectangles, circles, etc.) or drawn irregularly with the shape editor, whichcan contain any number of points.andP;  Although it wasn't demonstrated in Boston,the system will support an automatic indent feature that adjusts that spacebetween text and the outline of the frame.andP;  Already supported is a means ofspecifying the smallest column measure that can be filled with text.andM;Text frames can be linked automatically or manually to cause text to flowfrom one to the next, across page boundaries or within a page.andP;  Frames alsocan have parent-child relationships with each other so that if one is moved,the other moves also.andP;  Three levels are permissible so that one frame canhave both a parent and its own children.andP;  A child doesn't have to be inside aparent; it can be anywhere.andM;Frames can be moved freely with the mouse, with a locking feature that can beimplemented to limit movement to either the horizontal or the verticaldirection.andM;If all the text won't fit in the frame, the system will report how muchremains, although this wasn't demonstrated.andM;There is no vertical justification capability, but Magna says it could beadded easily.andM;Text editing and handamp;j.andP;  Each document has a master format that isautomatically applied to every paragraph to give it handamp;j settins.andP;  If a changeis made within the document, the change applies only to the paragraph that isspecified, making it unnecessary to embed a command to change back to themaster format (but, obviously, necessary to reapply a change if the change isto run more than one paragraph).andM;PageComp supports 100 job-related paragraph tags and 1,000 global paragraphformats, plus the standard Magna composition system job and global formats.andO;All composition parameters come from the formats except the line length,which is determined by the width of the frame.andP;  (The only other propertyinherent in a frame is its x/y position.)andM;When text is first flowed into a frame, it is handamp;j'ed to the parameters ineffect.andP;  If the text is edited subsequently, the editing is done in the textwindow and the text is then re-handamp;j'ed by command.andP;  Similarly, if changes aremade to the shape of a frame, the text is re-handamp;j'ed only when the operatorasks for a new handamp;j pass.andP;  So it is possible to make multiple changes to afile without having to watch the screen ripple through each one individually,as is often the case with systems from the high end to the low end.andP;  If aframe is moved without changing its shape, it isn't necessary to re-handamp;j thetext in it, another nice productivity feature.andM;The cursors in the two windows--WYSIWYG and text editing--track each other,at least to the nearest paragraph.andM;One area that Magna hasn't optimized concerns how much text is handamp;j'ed whenthe operator calls for handamp;j.andP;  As of the Seminars, the entire page was beinghandamp;j'ed every time the command was issued.andP;  We were told, though, that byType-X or Drupa the recomposition would be limited to all linked frames.andP;  Wewould prefer to start the handamp;j process at the beginning of the changed frame,not at the beginning of the linked file, which might be many pages earlier.andO;(Magma says its long-run target is to begin recomposition with the currentparagraph, which would be very nice.)andM;Graphics.andP;  Graphics in TIFF and EPS formats can be imported and used atactual size or scaled to fit in their frames.andP;  No other manipulation can beapplied, except to have text flow on top of or around a graphic.andP;  Althoughthis wasn't demonstrated, Magna says the program will enable graphics to bedisplayed while they are being moved, rather than having them disappear untilplaced in a new location.andM;Rules can be either generated by command or drawn on the screen with theruling tool in any of ten available (user-definable) weights.andM;File management.andP;  File handling is approximately the same as on Magna'sstandard composition system, which means that directories tend to be huge andfile management commands tend to be cumbersome.andP;  But in deference to noviceusers, basic functions are fairly straightforward.andP;  In the version previewedin Boston, while one person is laying out a page, a second person on adifferent computer can work with that file.andP;  We didn't have a chance to seewhat kinds of contention problems arise as a result of this, but we suspectthat the file should be locked to allow only one user at a time, even if oneis merely adjusting the layout, not editing the text.andP;  You certainly don'twant two users to be able to edit the same file concurrently.andM;Output.andP;  The system currently outputs only Encapsulated PostScript.andP;  Notably,the composed file contains nearly all the information needed by thePostScript output device, so translating commands is extremely quick--amatter of seconds for a typical page.andP;  Magna says it will add a driver forCora Typesetters next.andM;The prospects.andP;  Magna hasn't announced PageComp pricing yet, so it isdifficult to predict the market's reaction.andP;  But we were impressed by therange of functionality, the ease of use and the stress on productivity, whichshould combine to make it a solid contender in the market.andP;  It providesflexible layout tools, fast handamp;j and precision in placement of elements.andP;  The&quot;dashboard&quot; gives an instantaneous readout of the current position at anytime.andM;There are some things that haven't been implemented, such as verticaljustification and the automatic continuation of stories on later pages formagazine work.andP;  And we would like to see some features added for jogmanagement, such as routing of stories from one user to another and asystem-wide report of the status of all jobs for a given publication.andP;  But,in general, the system is well featured for an initial showing.andM;One factor that could influence the product's success is the choice ofWindows, rather than OS/2.andP;  Magna saw the size of the installed base of DOSPCs and decided, first, that it wanted to serve a ready market, and second,that it had its doubts about the eventual success of OS/2.andP;  In elaborating onthe latter point, Magna said it will deal with OS/2 when and if the needfinally comes.andP;  At the same event where Bestinfo was demonstratingintereactive handamp;j in an editing window under OS/2, Magna's decision may be acontroversial one.andP;  However, that decision is generally consistent with thecompany's history, which has been characterized by products aimed at a fairlylarge--and traditional--base of commercial customers.andP;  That philosophy hasproved successful in the past.andP;  We don't see any reason for it to change now,provided the pricing is appropriate and the system works when it gets intothe field.andM;Purdy adds PostScript, drops priceandM;Peter Purdy, who has put together a version of Archetype Designer as anetworked system, demonstrated the ability to drive PostScript imagesetters.andO;The initial systems had supported Chelgraph's Ace language because of itsspeed, but market demands have forced a reconsideration and the system nowoffers both.andP;  PostScript is handled through a RIP from Custom Applications(CAI) with a math coprocessor to increase speed.andP;  The recorder is still the72-pica Ultre unit.andM;Purdy's font board, which always has differentiated his product fromArchetype systems available elsewhere, generates the same type on the screenas on output, regardless of whether it is producing PostScript or Ace code.andO;In PostScript mode, the system converts Varityper fonts into Adobe Type 3format in real time.andM;The most recent addition to the system is a font editor for adjusting kerningvalues.andM;Since we last saw the Panda (Purda and Associates) system, the price has beendropped significantly.andP;  It now sells for $37,500, which includes compositionsoftware, two networked 80386 PCs, the font board, 200 type faces, the CAIPostScript RIP and the Ultre recorder.andM;Scandinavian market.andP;  In Scandinavia, where Purdy has had considerablesuccess selling the Panda system, the sales and support effort has beenjolted by the failure of his distributor, Typoline, which was based innorway.andP;  Purdy is continuing to support the customer base from the U.S.andO;while new arrangements are made.andP;  Meanwhile, we hear, the failed company hasstarted up in Norway under the same name, but not as a distributor of Purdy'ssystem.andM;SunandM;Sun's booth focus was on its Sparcstation and the range of products that nowrun on it particularly for publishing applications.andP;  The emphasis was on thethird-party relationships Sun has established, and on the fact that 85% ofits shipping volume is Sparc-based systems.andP;  There are now 627 F3 Folio fontsavailable along with a newer and faster version of the TypeScaler product.andO;URW and Autologic are now licenses, with URW to develop fonts for theEuropean market.andM;Several companies that exhibited with Sun had their own spaces and arecovered elsewhere in this issue.andM;A-R Editions.andP;  Primarily a music publisher, A-R Editions has developed asoftware package for music engraving.andP;  It was shown running under the OpenLook environment, with an upgrade to News coming soon.andP;  This productoriginally ran on Data General hardware, driving a Linotron 202 typesetter.andO;Now it runs on Sun Sparcstations and Sun-3/60s driving PostScript outputdevices.andP;  It can handle standard notation, as well as Petrucci style (littlediamond shapes with the stem of the note dropping from the bottom point andfairly ornate styling on staff and sharp and flat markers) and guitartablature.andM;AR developed its own music font using music fonts from Stempel as afoundation.andP;  The intention had been to develop a font that would beconsistent with traditional music fonts.andM;The system is essentially code driven, with an additional editable WYSIWYGversion of the file.andP;  The code-driven portion is based on DARMS, a standardencoding format for music data, and holds style codes.andP;  The PostScriptWYSIWYG version can be used for further editing of lyrics and notation withthese changes having priority over anything included in the code-basedversion.andP;  The WYSIWYG layout can be manually edited both horizontally andvertically, giving precise control over the placement of music notationrelative both to lyrics and to individual elements themselves.andM;Initial coding takes place on dumb terminals or PCs with ASCII, orMacintoshes with PostScript data imported to a networked Sun workstation.andO;On-screen editing is precise, with overall kerning, although at a fixed rate.andO;Text can be edited on the screen, including changes to point size and style.andO;The text fonts are the full range of Folio F3 fonts.andP;  The package also has anart drawing capability for illustration features, so that slurs are graduatedstrokes (instead of constant-width curves) and for special notations usefulparticularly in music teaching.andP;  Art objects are keyed to styling parameters;art can be imported as EPSF, with any graphics editing required inPostScript.andM;The product features automatic syntax and error correction and has beenavailable on the Sun for 18 months, although the port to the Sparcstationhappened two months ago.andP;
