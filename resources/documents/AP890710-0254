The walkout forced the temporary shutdown of the mills.   A Georgia-Pacific spokesman said the strike involves about 1,000union workers at mills in Crossett and Fordyce in Arkansas, and aroughly equal number of workers at mills in Louisville, Taylorsvilleand Gloster, Miss. The plants belong to Georgia-Pacific'sMid-Continent Division.   Workers at Crossett and Gloster are represented by theInternational Woodworkers' of America. Workers at Fordyce,Louisville and Taylorsville are members of the United Brotherhood ofCarpenters and Joiners.   Union and company negotiators had continued talks past twodeadlines following the June 1 expiration of the old contract, butthe unions rejected the company's latest offer Wednesday and picketswent up at the mills about 5 a.m. today.   The plants manufacture southern pine plywood for residential andcommercial construction. Spokesman Terry Hadaway at the Crossettplant said the company would shut down the plants at leasttemporarily.   ``The plans are currently to conduct orderly shutdown of each ofthose operations. Beyond that we're evaluating the circumstances todetermine what our next action will be,'' Hadaway said today. Hewould not speculate on how long the plants would be idled, nor wouldhe detail the contract dispute.   Union officials said the company's latest offer called for afour-year contract, with pay increases of 2 percent the first,second and fourth years of the pact and 3 percent the third year.The unions wanted a three-year contract with pay increases of 3percent each year.   But the union's main concern was over the company's proposal topay workers regular wages for working on Sunday and dropping timeand-a-half wages paid under the old contract. The company offeredSunday workers a one-time bonus of $800 to $1,000.   Steve Price, president of IWA Local 5-475 in Crossett, said theloss of Sunday premium pay would cost maintenance workers about$2,300 a year and would mean about $1,400 in lost wages for utilityemployees. Also, he said, about 30 percent of workers at theCrossett plant don't work on Sunday and would not get the bonus.   Minimum hourly pay at the plants is $7.90, Price said.   The strike marks the second time in four years thatGeorgia-Pacific workers have walked off the job. Members of theUnited Paperworkers Union staged a three-month strike in 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
