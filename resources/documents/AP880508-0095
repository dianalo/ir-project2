PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new Minnesota law that will ban plasticfoam packaging made with ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbons isn'tcreating much of a stir in the packaging industry, but the law'sbackers say its symbolic impact is substantial.   By enacting restrictions against foam packaging produced withthe compound, known as CFCs, the state has created a vehicle forpossible future restrictions on other products made with CFCs,lawmakers and industry watchers say.   ``It will send a very strong message to industries who use CFCsthat they have to clean up their act,'' said Sen. Greg Dahl, whohelped shepherd the law through the legislature.   CFC-produced foam containers used for packaging fast food andother products may not be sold or made in the state beginning in1990.   The plastic foam packaging industry isn't worried, partlybecause it does not have a manufacturing presence in Minnesota.Furthermore, manufacturers already have agreed to use a substitutechemical compound that is less damaging to the ozone layer than areCFCs.   ``I don't foresee it as a problem for anyone in the industry,''said Jim Lammers, a spokesman for Dart Container Corp. of Mason,Mich., the nation's leading producer of foam cups and containers.   But even though the Minnesota law is regarded as a marshmallow,its chief authors and environmental experts say it its symboliceffect and future implications are important.   ``It's like the seat belt law with no fine,'' said Rep. SteveTrimble, who along with Dahl herded the bill through thelegislature. ``It's a warning to people.''   The CFC packaging ban breezed through the Minnesota legislaturethis year and was signed by Gov. Rudy Perpich. Trimble said Mainewas the only other state with a similar law.   Gaseous CFCs are used to expand polystyrene beads into the foamyplastic containers that some fast-food chains are using to packagehamburgers. Egg cartons, cups, and cafeteria trays also commonlyuse the product, Lammers said.   The chemical compound escapes to the atmosphere duringproduction, slowly rising 15 to 25 miles to deplete the ozone layerthat protects the Earth from the Sun's cancer-causing ultravioletrays. Some CFCs are trapped in the foam products and released later.   The Foodservice andamp; Packaging Institute stated last month that theindustry would be operating with a less-damaging substitutechemical by 1989.   The substitute, known as HCFC-22, was approved last December bythe U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and three majorenvironmental groups support its use until a completely safesubstitute is found. HCFC-22 still has some potential for damagingthe ozone layer, but the Environmental Protection Agency estimatesit is only about 5 percent as powerful as CFCs.   CFC use in making food packaging foams account for only 1.5percent to 2 percent of the United States' total CFC use.   But Dean Abrahamson, a professor of public affairs at theHumphrey Institute, said the Minnesota law would have an impactbecause ``it's an indication of the state's concern.''   He said the CFC law on the books could be strengthened later tocover other sources of CFCs, which also are used in refrigerationunits and construction materials.   ``Next year I'm sure we'll come back and look at this issue somemore,'' Trimble said.   Dahl said he would like to pass legislation next year requiringwarning labels on other products that contain or are manufacturedwith CFCs.   Under the new law, state and local governments will be bannedbeginning January 1 from purchasing, manufacturing, selling ordistributing packaging known to be CFC-processed. The ban will beextended to cover all citizens beginning Jan. 1, 1990. Violatorscould be fined up to $500.   The law passed by the 1988 Legislature also appropriates $25,000to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to study ways toeliminate other CFC sources in the state.</TEXT></DOC>
