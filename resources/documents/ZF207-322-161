(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>RDBMS MARKET SIZZLES WITH NEW PRODUCTSandM;Database management systems (DBMSes) are among the hottest, most in-demandsoftware applications at DEC sites.andP;  And relational database managementsystems are topping buyer wish lists.andM;Buyers of relational database management systems--more flexible and easier tomaintain than their hierarchical or network data model predecessors--canchoose from a range of pepped-up new RDBMS products.andM;Specifically, DEC buyers this year will see the following:andM;* Greater interoperability.andP;  The top three RDBMS vendors--Oracle, DEC andRelational Technology--are heralding a new age of interoperability and whatDEC calls &quot;enterprisewide computing.&quot;andP;  A slew of inteface and portabilityannouncements made during the past year by DEC, Oracle, Relational Technologyand other VAX-market RDBMS veterans such as Information Builders andInterbase attest to the trend toward mixed environments.andM;* SQL.andP;  Widespread adoption of SQL (now including Relational Technology, thecreator of Query Language, which is known as QUEL) makes it easier forvendors to write interfaces between VAX RDBMSes and those residing on otherhardware platforms.andM;* Emphasis on applications generation.andP;  Bare-bones RDBMSes are quicklybecoming commodity items, according to Kathy Hession, product marketingmanager for Cullinet, a newcomer to the world of VAX RDBMSes.andP;  Applicationtools &quot;will be the real differentiators,&quot; she said.andM;* New faces.andP;  Many IBM RDBMS vendors--such as Cullinet and MustSoftware--have entered the VAX RDBMS market during the past year.andM;* New strength from DEC.andP;  DEC's Rdb, considered mediocre by many, hsattracted new interest, largely due to DEC's recent agreement to comarketapplication development tools from Relational Technology.andM;* Continued emphasis on on-line transaction processing (OLTP).andP;  The past yearhas also seen OLTP continue as a major RDBMS capability.andP;  Competitivepressure has led in some cases to inflated performanceclaims--&quot;benchmarketing.&quot;andP;  It has also sparked the creation of the OnlineTransaction Processing Council to make sure vendors keep on the straight andnarrow.andM;* Fierce competition.andP;  According to Kevin Gallagher, public relations managerfor Relational Technology, approximately three-quarters of all VAX sitesdon't currently use RDBMSes.andP;  &quot;There's a huge potential for growth there,&quot;Gallagher said.andM;* Unix products.andP;  The emergence of relational database management systemsthat run not only on VAXes but also on Unix and Ultrix machines has broughtRDBMSes to workstations and boosted performance.andM;Distributed databases--a hot topic for the last few years--are now a quietissue, largely because RDBMS products have yet to match vendors' oftengrandiose promises.andM;Nonetheless, tht hasn't slowed down buyers at all.andP;  The Gartner Group, aStamford, Conn., market research company, expects worldwide VAX-residentRDBMS sales nearly to triple over three years, leaping from $361 million in1988 to $934 million in 1991.andM;Whatever the improvements, the message is clear: Plain vanilla databases arenot enough.andM;&quot;Customers want a complete set of tools,&quot; said James Geary, director ofmarketing for CompuServe Data Technologies.andP;  &quot;We approach our customers as anintegrated product.andP;  We think it's essential to any [RDBMS] applications.&quot;andM;For example, most--but not all--RDBMSes include a report writer.andP;  Many alsohave integral 4GLs and/or 3GLs to increase application programmingproductivity.andM;Some RDBMSes provide links to computer-aided software engineering (CASE)tools.andP;  Relational Technology, for instance, recently signed an agreementwith Cadre Technologies of Providence, R.I., that enables Ingres users toaccess Cadre's Teamwork CASE tools.andP;  And, Geary said, CompuServe is currentlyevaluating the Excelerator CASE tools from Index Technology, located inCambridge, Mass.andM;Relational Technology's Ingres database management system includes tools thatcan be unbundled from the RDBMS and used separately.andM;Many RDBMSes provide integral graphics capabilities or links to third-partygraphics packages.andP;  Many also provide interfaces to spreadsheets, statisticalsoftware and even word processors (for the small percentage of users who mayuse RDBMSes for office automation applications).andM;Oracle also offers an electronic mail utility and accounting applicationsthat can be integrated with the Oracle RDBMS.andM;Only a handful of RDBMS products currently support the X Window System.andP;  Somevendors indicated they are working to support DECwindows, DEC's commercialimplementation of X windows.andP;  But Richard Finkelstein, president ofPerformance Computing, a Chicago consulting company that specializes inrelational database management, doesn't expect more vendors to move in thatdirection until a solid windowing standard emerges.andM;&quot;Users want integrated window front ends,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;They want aspreadsheet, word processor or desktop publishing in separate windows, andtheir RDBMS in another window, and they want to move data between thoseapplications.andP;  You can do that with X windows, but who's going to build to aproprietary interface, [that is,] DECwindows?andP;  It's expensive.&quot;andM;Aignificant number of Unix and Ultrix RDBMSes also have appeared in the DECmarket.andP;  The trend is unmistakable, said Susan Weil, senior research analystat the Gartner Group.andP;  RDBMSes blaze on Unix machines.andP;  &quot;It's the newtechnologies available under Unix,&quot; Weil said, &quot;such as symmetricalmultiprocessing, which DEC doesn't have.andM;&quot;You can get quite good price/performance and performance in Unix,&quot; shecontinued.andP;  &quot;Sequent [Computer Systems] boxes have let Oracle and RelationalTechnology come up with some good benchmark results.&quot;andP;  Weil said theprice/performance results aren't as favorable to RDBMSes running underUltrix.andM;MORE THAN PLAIN VANILLAandM;&quot;Customers want complete set of tools,&quot; CompuServe's Geary agreed.andP;  &quot;Weapproach our customers as an integrated product.andP;  We think it's essential toany [RDBMS] applications,&quot; he said.andM;On average, RDBMS prices increase from 7 to 10 percent annually.andP;  Competitiondoesn't tend to depress or maintain RDBMS prices.andP;  Gallagher and othervendors said most RDBMS buyers don't consider price their foremostconcern--instead, it's performance and ease of use.andM;CompuServe's Geary said the company's System 1032 4GL/DMBS provides a &quot;humaninterface&quot; that doesn't &quot;forget about the thinking processes and data needsof end users.&quot;andM;Additionally, Culinet's Hession emphasized the need for presenting aconsistent user interface, whether users are employing the database or itsrelated tools.andM;In users' thoughts, performance seems to tank No.andP;  1.andP;  Benchmarks fly betweenvendors like arrows, and buyers tend to get caught in the middle.andP;  Whosebenchmarks are valid?andP;  Which claims should users believe?andM;Market analysts says users are turned off by the bickering--what the GartnerGroup calls &quot;bench-marketing&quot;--and have stopped paying attention.andO;CompuServe's Geary suggests that prospective buyers ask vendors to let themtest-drive RDBMSes using their own applications.andM;&quot;That's the proof in the p udding,&quot; Geary said.andP;  &quot;I can look at all thebenchmarks I want.andP;  Look for the vendor who will [loan] their software andlet you truly test out what's best for you.&quot;andM;Performance Computing's Finkelstein hopes this year will bring &quot;more truth in[RDBMS] marketing and sales.andP;  I don't think anyone wins with the kind ofexcessive marketing hype that goes on,&quot; he said.andM;Despite the claims and counterclaims, vendors and analysts agree on onepoint: RDBMS performance continues to climb.andM;Most RDBMSes use SQL to create, update and retrieve information, but they allshare a common theme: the relational data model.andP;  (See &quot;RDBMSes Get SQLEdge,&quot; page 73.)andM;Relational theories emerged in the 1970s, Finkelstein said.andP;  Before then,DBMS data models were defined according to the whims of their creators.andM;Today's RDBMSes &quot;aren't foreign [to each other],&quot; Finkelstein said.andP;  &quot;We'retalking siblings rather than distant cousins.&quot;andM;While RDBMSes traditionally were used as decision-support tools in commercialenvironments, most vendors and market analysts say today's RDBMSes satisfydemands imposed by most applications.andM;RDBMS performance has increased enough so that users can consider using thepackages for transaction-intensive OLTP, which tends to involve massivedatabases and 24-hour operation.andM;Sybase, which pioneered the use of RDBMSes for OLTP, recently joined forceswith Stratus Computer, located in Marlborough, Mass., to create SQL/2000.andO;The system, announced last May, allows communications and information sharingbetween Stratus' OLTP-oriented computers and workstations.andM;Oracle and Relational Technology are both attempting to compete with Sybasefor transaction processing business.andP;  Oracle version 6, introduced in July,was designed specifically to make the product competitive in OLTPenvironments.andM;NOT FOR ENGINEERING SITEandM;RDBMSes are less suitable for scientific and engineering environments, whereapplications often need to store, access and modify entire objects--the imageof a car, for instance--rather than what Performance Computing's Finkelsteindescribed as data at the &quot;atomic level.&quot;andM;Scientists and engineers also may be less interested in having a programmingproductivity too--the RDBMS forte--and more concerned with processing speed.andO;&quot;In that case, their database would probably be built on [the] flat file[model],&quot; the Gartner Group's Weil said.andM;Ken Jacobs, Oracle's director of RDBMS marketing, conceded that users mightnot store graphic images on RDBMSes, but he said they might want to keeprecords describing the image--who created it, when it was made, etc.--in arelational package.andM;Mike Stonebreaker, co-founder of Relational Technology and chairman of thecomputer science department at the University of California at Berkeley, isworking on Postgres, which Relational's Gallagher called &quot;the next generationof relational.&quot;andM;According to consultant Finkelstein, Postgres will store records relationallybut will precompile data.andP;  Users will then be able to access objects quickly,he said.andM;&quot;To that extent, [Relational] leads in understanding that there's a segmentof the market not being well taken care of by relational technology as itexists today,&quot; Finkelstein said.andP;  &quot;By 1989 or 1990, new relational productswill emerge that address CAD/CAM applications.&quot;andM;To help RDBMS users who need to access text files, Verity of Mountain View,Calif., introduced Verity Topic last month.andP;  The product allows RDBMS usersto retrieve and manipulate unstructured text files.andP;  Verity Topic currentlysupports products from Sybase, Informix, Oracle and Relational.andM;Exchanging data with other VAX databases and portability--the ability tofunction in multiple operating systems and desktop platforms--are becomingthe RDBMS market's latest trumpeted offerings.andP;  In a recent interview withDigital Review, Oracle President and Chief Executive Officer Larry Ellisoncited the portability of his company's RDBMS as the most significant reasonfor the product's success.andP;  (See &quot;We Grow More in Two Years Than MostCompanies Grow in 10,&quot; Digital Review, Aug. 15, 1988, page 8.)andM;Many RDBMSes can read and modify files residing on other VAX databases,including DEC's VAX Rdb/VMS.andP;  Some vendors also have written ports of theirVAX RDBMSes to run on--and share data with the VAX RDBMSes from--Macintoshes,IBM PCs, PS/2s and mainframes, Sun workstations, and Data General andHewlett-Packard computers.andP;  Many are also able to exchange data with othervendors' RDBMSes running in foreign hardware environments.andM;A product now being jointly developed by Flex Link International of Renton,Wash., and DB/Access of Cupertino, Calif., is intended to give VAX usersfield-level access to relational, sequential and VSAM files residing ondissimilar host systems, and at fast data transfer rates.andP;  And CompuServe's1032/PCI &quot;seamlessly&quot; integrates IBM PCs with the System 1032 RDBMS runningon VAXes, CompuServe's Geary said.andM;DEC, meanwhile, offers VIDA and the IDMS/R login utility as its softwaresolutions for accessing IBM databases from a VAX.andP;  The software translatesVMS user requests into queries compatible with Cullinet's IDMS/R, which is anIBM-resident RDBMS, communicating the queries via DEC's DEC-net/SNA Gateway.andM;&quot;We're seeing the merging of enterprisewide networking and the relationaldatabase,&quot; said Brian Owen, senior director of Oracle's DEC productsdivision.andM;&quot;The days of software being tied to a single hardware environment are gone,&quot;Owen added.andM;&quot;Oracle can run the same code on every machine in a customer's enterprisenetwork--IBM PCs or clones, Macs, Unix workstations, VAXes running VMS orUltrix, and IBM mainframes,&quot; Owen said.andP;  &quot;That's what the big corporatecustomers in DEC environments look like today.&quot;andM;Similarly, Relational Technology's Gallagher said he believes RDBMS users inthe next decade will want their desk tops to serve as command centers, addingthat the vendor responding to such needs will be the RDBMS leader.andM;Some vendors and market analysts are skeptical that such portability isefficient or even necessary.andP;  &quot;The way an RDBMS performs depends very much onthe machine it's running on,&quot; Performance Computting's Finkelstein asserted.andO;&quot;The RDBMS needs to be tuned to the machine.&quot;andM;Finkelstein allowed that RDBMSes can have &quot;limited&quot; portability, citingSybase's focus on VAXes, Sun workstations, IBM's OS/2, Steve Jobs' NeXTmachine, and Stratus' OLTP computers as a reasonable undertaking.andP;  &quot;But theidea of porting to 50 platforms is absurd,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;No one can do thatwell especially when the platforms are so different.&quot;andM;CompuServe's Geary and Oracle's Owen stressed that their companies' RDBMSeswere written on VAXes specifically for VAX/VMS environments.andM;It all boils down to performance.andP;  How well does a particular RDBMS run givena site's particular front-end applications, hardware layout, and image- ortransaction-processing needs?andP;  Caveat emptor applies here as it does in otherindustries: Buy what suits you best.andM;RDBMSes Get SQL EdgeandM;SQL offers RDBMSes Three advantages: SQL isn't tied to any operating system;SQL queries use the same protocols to access local and remote RDBMSes; andSQL also carries ANSI standardization status and IBM's blessing.andM;Though SQL implementations share the same syntax, no vendors use identicalSQL dialects.andP;  Front-end tool vendors still, however, port applications todifferent databases, said Richard Finkelstein, president of PerformanceComputing, a Chicago relational database management consulting company.andO;These vendors decide which RDBMSes to pursue and then, if necessary,fine-tune the SQL to accommodate that database.andM;Oracle's director of RDBMS marketing, Ken Jacobs, said SQL is weak when doingcomplex calculations or conditional queries.andP;  Thus, he said, some vendors arewriting extensions to SQL.andP;  Oracle's PL/SQL, for instance, is a proceduralSQL extension for application development and transaction processing.andP;  Oraclealso provides SQL*Tutor as an introduction to the environment, as well astools for users with varying levels of SQL expertise.andM;Because SQL queries may be difficult for some users to devise, NaturalLanguage of Berkeley, Calif., and Intelligent Business Systems of New Haven,Conn., offer interfaces that accept English requests and translate them intoSQL commands.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
