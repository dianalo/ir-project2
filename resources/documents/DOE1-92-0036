This paperdescribes the data acquisition and evaluation system utilized, the individualcool storage systems, and a representative sample of the results obtained.The data acquisition and evaluation system utilized was developed bythe Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) specifically for monitoringcool storage systems. It incorporates remote data retrieval from theon-site data logger and automatic reduction and analysis of the data.Data retrieval is performed on a daily basis to facilitate detectionof system or instrument failures in a timely manner. The data reductionsoftware which runs on a personal computer, calculates the efficiencyof the cool storage system and estimates the energy consumption and peakdemand contribution of a conventional air conditioning system. The threecool storage systems monitored use chilled water as the storage mediumand differ only in tank design and capacity. One system uses multipletanks, one uses a single stratified tank and the third uses three tankswith internal diaphragms. The results indicate that cool storage is aneffective method for load management, but minor changes at two of thesites would increase the energy savings.</TEXT></DOC>
