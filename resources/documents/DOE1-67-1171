This is facilitated by the modular nature of the CANDUdesign. The Candu 300, in providing a station design life of 100 years,significantly advances plant life extension capabilities. All key componentsare designed for a minimum 40 year life with the provision for easy replacement.An example of this is the Candu 300 fuel channel. The fuel channel designhas been modified to allow the 208 fuel channels to be replaced withina 90 day outage. Even major equipment can be replaced with a minimumof down time (4 weeks for example for steam generators). This is facilitatedby the station layout, which provides 360 deg access to the five principalbuildings, and by spacious and well organized building internal arrangements.A comprehensive in-service inspection program, in combination with atransient monitoring and recording function within the station controlcomputers is utilized to monitor component status. The Candu 300 hasbeen designed utilizing the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited Candid Engineeringsystem, which incorporates advanced computer aided design and draftingbased on 3-dimensional modelling. This has permitted the replacementof all components to be simulated.</TEXT></DOC>
