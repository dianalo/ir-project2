Even though airlines are moving to cut back on frequent-flier programs, it's still possible to sign up for triple mileage.    Delta Air Lines, which started the triple-mileage madness last November, lets passengers qualify any time this year -- if they buy tickets with the American Express card. Another catch: They must be enrolled in the triple-mileage plan before flying, and it takes about three weeks to process the application.    Randy Petersen, editor of Frequent, a Colorado Springs, Colo., magazine for frequent fliers, says travelers should apply for Delta's triple-mileage program even if they have no current plans to fly the airline. &quot;Your United flight might be canceled, and Delta might have the only connection,&quot; he says.    Generally, the airlines let passengers qualify for triple mileage only if they took a round-trip journey in the first three months of this year.    Continental Airlines makes exceptions for routes it wants to promote. From next Monday to Oct. 15, it will let passengers qualify for triple mileage if they fly a round trip between Newark, N.J., and Kansas City, Mo., or between Newark and Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minn. Also qualifying are round trips between Cleveland and five cities: Baltimore; Hartford, Conn.; Flint, Mich.; Lansing, Mich.; and Saginaw, Mich.    Flying any of those trips -- for as little as $78 round trip between Cleveland and the Michigan cities -- means triple mileage on Continental and Eastern Airlines for the rest of the year.    A few warnings, though, for newcomers to the game: Racking up mileage can be a time-consuming, messy obsession. A New York lawyer has a four-inch-thick pile of ticket stubs, used boarding passes, and frequent-flier regulations on her desk at home. &quot;It rivals income-tax preparation for sheer eating of hours,&quot; she says.    Like checkbooks, mileage statements should be reconciled regularly. The difference is that airlines' frequent-flier departments seem to make more blunders than banks. They also have more complicated rules. Once you begin to understand the rules, they change.    Persistence is a requirement. When mileage maniacs get an airline reservations clerk who questions or hesitates to book their convoluted connections, they hang up and call again.    Sound like a game? &quot;Face it,&quot; says Mr. Petersen. &quot;It's no fun to get on an airplane any more. These programs have become an outlet for a little excitement. . . . It's like being a Boy Scout and collecting badges.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
