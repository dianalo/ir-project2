But thatisn't stopping the opposing sides on the abortion issue frommounting intense lobbying campaigns as the justices prepare to heara controversial Missouri case that could end the country's currentera of legal abortions.   The Supreme Court is expected to hear the appeal, Webs, which favorsabortion on demand.   ``Our people want the Supreme Court and President Bush, who'spushing the court on this issue, to know just how they feel,'' shesaid. ``We are co-sponsoring what promises to be a massive march inWashington on April 9th and I won't be surprised if a quarter of amillion demonstrators show up; our people are furious.''   O'Dell, who is coordinating NOW's role in the march, said shethinks a big turnout won't go unnoticed at the court.   ``Whatever the decision is,'' she said, ``it will be couched inlegal terms but, in fact, it is a political question that, likeProhibition, ultimately will be decided by public opinion.''   Judie Brown, president of the American Life League which opposeslegalized abortions, said she, too, thinks political considerationswill weigh heavily in the Supreme Court's decision.   ``Public opinion means everything to the court,'' said Brown, whosays her organization includes 200,000 families around the country.``We feel all forms of expression will impact on the court.''   The American Life League's most expensive form of expression willbe a series of full-page advertisements in USA Today, The WashingtonPost and The Washington Times. The ads will run during the weekbefore the opposition's April march and will cost $150,000.   ``They will include just-released information we've taken fromthe file of the late Justice William O. Douglas during the debate onRoe vs. Wade,'' she said. ``It's clear from these files that a smallbut very vocal minority was able to influence the decision whichmade abortion legal in this country.''   In Roe vs. Wade, the court held that while a woman's right toprivacy gives her the right to have an abortion, the state mayregulate or prohibit abortions once the fetus is viable.   Since the 1973 decision, there have been relatively fewthird-trimester abortions even though that same court, in Doe vs.Bolton, said the mother's life or health should be an overridingfactor in the decision of whether to permit an abortion even afterthe fetus is viable.   In case to be in April, the Missouri Legislature passed a 1986statute banning abortions at public hospitals or any other publicfacilities unless the woman's life is in danger. The act, whosepreamble states that viability begins at conception, also forbidspublic funds from being used for abortions or for abortioncounseling except when the mother's life is threatened.   The statute was challenged immediately by two abortion clinics,Reproductive Health Services of St. Louis and Planned Parenthood inKansas City.   In March 1987, a federal district judge in Kansas City declaredthe major sections of the statute to be unconstitutionalinfringements of Roe vs. Wade. In July 1987, the 8th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals upheld the bulk of the lower court's decision.   Last year, William Webster, Missouri's attorney general, askedthe Supreme Court to review the case. He also asked the court, if itshould side with the appeals courts, to then consider whether Roevs. Wade itself is constitutional.   The Supreme Court announced in January it would consider thecase, setting off a flurry of planning and activity on both sides ofthe issue.   ``We've already raised most of the $150,000 for our upcomingnewspaper ads,'' Brown said, adding that $150,000 is anexceptionally large expenditure for the American Life League.   The National Abortion Rights Action League already has spent morethan $500,000 on newspaper advertising. The full-page ads, whichfeature a coat hanger, a reminder of the days of back-alleyabortions, first ran on Jan. 22.   ``We're running them in some of the major newspapers across thecountry,'' said Kate Michelman, NARAL's executive director. ``We'realso doing radio and TV ads and making ourselves available to themedia for interviews and talk shows and the like.''   So far, she said, there has been a tremendous response to theads, which ask for pledges of support.   ``We've had more than 30,000 responses to the January ads,'' shesaid. ``The ads cost $300,000 and we took in $350,000.''   Michelman said while NARAL sees a drawn-out fight over theabortion issue, she feels the Supreme Court can be influenced.   ``There's no doubt we're in trouble, given the changes in thecourt since Roe vs. Wade,'' she said. ``But the Supreme Courtdoesn't act in a vacuum; it is sensitive to the political and socialclimate of the country.''   Because of this, said David Andrews, acting president of thePlanned Parenthood Federation of America, his group is trying tomobilize mainstream Americans.   ``There's no question this is a political issue and, while theSupreme Court can't be lobbied directly, it can influenced by agreat outpouring of voices,'' he said.   Barbara MacGear of Operation Rescue, a Binghamton, N.Y.-based,pro-life group which has helped stage protests at abortion clinicsaround the country, said, ``We plan keeping with our agenda'' ofdemonstrations and civil disobedience.   ``Frankly,'' she added, ``I don't know whether the Supreme Courtcan be swayed by what happens in the streets but we're watchingclosely. What we're really hoping for, though, is a right-to-lifeamendment to the U.S. Constitution.''   Douglas Johnson, legal director of the National Right-To-LifeCommittee, acknowledged that the court's acceptance of the Missouricase and the resulting news media focus have ``provided an unusualforum.''   He said he has been ``kind of amused'' by some of the efforts toget the Supreme Court's attention.   ``In our view,'' he said, ``these efforts are unlikely toinfluence the case. Our legal brief certainly isn't going to talkabout the Harris Poll, it talks about the Constitution.''   Then, he added, ``but Roe vs. Wade was a political decision, anact of judicial lawmaking.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Strat Douthat is the AP Southeast regionalreporter, based in Atlanta.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 12</NOTE></DOC>
