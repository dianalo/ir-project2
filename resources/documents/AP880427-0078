(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A congressional subcommittee has beguninvestigating alleged corruption, drug trafficking and civil rightsviolations in Robeson County, according to a local congressman.   Rep. Charlie Rose, whose 7th District includes Robeson County,said he contacted Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of the HouseJudiciary Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, after talking toconstituents.   ``They (the subcommittee) have told me that at this point theydon't think that a public hearing would be helpful, but they aregathering information about problems that Robeson County citizenshave had,'' Rose said.   The Fayetteville Times reported today that a subcommittee staffmember, who spoke on condition he not be named, said he had beentold the March 26 shotgun slaying of Indian activist Julian Piercemay have been politically motivated.   Investigators initially called the slaying an ``assassination,''but later said Pierce's death was apparently the result of adomestic dispute unrelated to his political campaign.   Pierce had been a candidate for Superior Court judge and membersof minority groups called for outside investigations.   One man has been charged with first-degree murder in theslaying. A second man, for whom a warrant was issued, apparentlycommitted suicide, authorities said.   The subcommittee source said the investigation also coverspossible civil rights violations in the deaths of Joyce Sinclair, ablack woman who was found stabbed to death in October 1985; andJimmy Earl Cummings, an Indian who was shot to death in November1986 by Deputy Sheriff Kevin Stone, the son of Sheriff HubertStone. A coroner's jury ruled Cummings' death as either selfdefense or an accidental shooting.   If the allegations about public corruption in connection withdrug trafficking and other matters are substantiated, the sourcesaid, the subcommittee will determine whether to hold publichearings or turn the information over to the U.S. JusticeDepartment for possible indictments.   Many Lumbee Indians and blacks in Robeson County say they'vebeen discriminated against by white politicians. The county'spopulation of about 100,000 is 37 percent Indian, 37 percent whiteand 26 percent black.</TEXT></DOC>
