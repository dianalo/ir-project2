(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Florida environmental officials expect todecide soon whether to grant a controversial 25-year dredging permitfor the Apalachicola River, considered vital by shipping interestsin three states.   But the permit requested by the Army Corps of Engineers isopposed by nearly everyone else, including environmentalists andfishing interests.   ``If navigation survives and prospers, the economy of the regionbenefits,'' said Homer Hirt, chief of the Jackson County PortAuthority in this Florida Panhandle river town.   Hirt also is interim executive director of the Tri-RiversWaterway Association, which is lobbying for the permit on behalf ofshippers in the Panhandle, Alabama and Georgia.   Environmentalists oppose the permit because they believe 25 yearsis too long and because they contend the Corps of Engineers hasfailed to state exactly what it plans to do. They also are worriedthat the dredging would destroy habitat for fish and wildlife.   Corps biologist Curtis Flakes said the agency will safeguard theenvironment and that it has indicated what it intends to do throughpublication of a navigation maintenance plan.   The state Department of Environmental Regulation is expected tomake an internal decision in a few days, said David Arnold, aspokesman for the agency.   Congress in 1939 authorized the corps to maintain a navigationchannel in the river 100 feet wide and 9 feet deep, keeping both theriver and its northern tributaries, the Chattahoochee and Flintrivers in Georgia and Alabama, open to traffic.   But the corps still must obtain permits from each of the statesfor dredging and removing snags such as fallen trees.   Florida, which benefits least from the river traffic but has themost to lose from an environmental standpoint, has used its muscleover the years to reject some proposals and demand concessionsbefore approving others.   Such permits usually are granted for no more than five years. A25-year permit is unprecedented. The corps' current two-year permitexpires Jan. 31.   Opposing the permit request are the Florida Defenders of theEnvironment, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National MarineFisheries Service, the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission,and the Apalachee Audubon Society.</TEXT></DOC>
