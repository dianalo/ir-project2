The beginning of the Hebrew year will not be marked by blowingthe traditional ram's horn, or shofar, in Israel's 8,000 synagoguesbecause the holiday falls on the Jewish Sabbath, when it isforbidden to sound the horn.   Instead, the shofar will be blown on the second day of the newyear festival Sunday.   The new year 5750 was interpreted by some religious scholars asthe ``year of miracles'' because 50 stands for the letter ``n'' inHebrew. The scholars linked the ``n'' to the word ``nisim,'' ormiracle.   But some newspapers interpreted the new year as the root to theword ``tashan,'' or sleep, suggesting weariness over the 21-monthPalestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the territories.   At least 575 Arabs have been killed by Israeli troops andcivilians during the revolt. Forty Israelis also have been slain inthe violence.   To prevent the uprising from interfering in the holiday, thearmy blocked travel into Israel by residents of the Gaza Stripuntil Monday morning and increased searches of Palestiniansentering from the West Bank.   Overnight, police in Israel's Galilee rounded up 105Palestinians who broke the law prohibiting residents of theterritories from spending the night in Israel.   The army also increased patrols along the Lebanese and Jordanianborders and police were reinforced throughout the country to headoff possible guerrilla attacks.   ``We want not only to ensure a feeling of safety but to let thepeople of Israel celebrate as they choose,'' Police commissionerDavid Krauss said on Israel radio.   Rosh Hashana is celebrated on the first and second day of theJewish month of Tishrei. It marks the beginning of the ``10 days ofawe,'' when Jews reflect on their deeds of the past year and repentfor their sins.   The period culminates in the fast of Yom Kippur, the Day ofAtonement, which comes on Oct. 9.   Tonight, the start of the holiday, Jewish families gather fortraditional dinners, eating apples dipped in honey to signify a``sweet new year.''   Ashkenazim, or Jews of European origin, eat a festive meal thattraditionally includes chopped liver and gefilte fish, whileSephardim, Jews from the Middle East, eat couscous and fish heads.   Vacationers, enjoying a long weekend, flocked to beaches in TelAviv and other coastal cities, taking advantage of sunny skies and80-degree weather.</TEXT></DOC>
