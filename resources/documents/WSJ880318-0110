Strong-arm leaders in Managua and Panama City decided that the impasse between Ronald Reagan and Jim Wright had removed all risks. So Managua invaded Honduras and Panama's Noriega turned guns on his own people.    Mr. Reagan has responded to the Managua power play, but even now the question remains: Is he going to play offense, or defense?    In particular, are these troops going to sit for days or weeks, becoming a Central American version of Lebanon's &quot;peacekeeping&quot; force?    Whatever the intention, is the administration prepared to deal with the heavy political offensive the Democrats will roll out against this action?    We express these concerns, because the Reagan presidency generally hasn't handled situations such as this very well. Rather than defending without apology actions it believes in, the administration's instinct generally has been to compromise with its Capitol Hill adversaries. Appearing before Congress George Shultz said, &quot;It's important that people know the United States will fight.&quot; And then he said the troops &quot;are not there in a shooting capacity. We haven't been asked for that.&quot;    What are the American people supposed to make of a statement like that? These recurrent Hamletlike attitudes toward using military force merely allow the opposition's criticism to get its foot inside the credibility door. Democratic Senator John Kerry: &quot;I think the notion that there's a real invasion is just ridiculous.&quot; Which probably makes sense to some people if you're airlifting the 82nd Airborne into a country under attack while saying they &quot;are not there in a shooting capacity.&quot;    It is especially unfortunate to see the administration slip into this reactive posture when the circumstances make it unnecessary. Our sense is that the political momentum of the Central American issue is moving against Congress's Democratic majority. The opportunity is at hand for the administration to finally elevate this issue out of the usual bog of Beltway concerns (topmost of which seems to be, what did the Honduran president request and when did he request it?), and move the debate onto something rarely debated in Washington, such as the actual foreign-policy and national-security interests of the United States.    The Democrats are on the defensive because Nicaragua, to whose benefit they stripped the Contras of aid and beatified the Arias peace process, is behaving with about as much sophistication as you'd expect from any of the thugs who run a Soviet-financed satellite. Nicaraguan women who assemble to protest the draft are now routinely beaten up by Sandinista gangs. Could Senator Kerry comment on that? Can we get up a debate among the House leadership over why the Soviet Union, concurrent with the peace process, has in January and February shipped Nicaragua $100 million (3,100 metric tons) of war materiel, creating a current inventory of 700 artillery guns, 500 missile launchers, 250 armored vehicles and 150 tanks? House Speaker Jim Wright: &quot;I know of nothing that justifies sending troops&quot; to Honduras.    Simultaneously the people of Panama are crying for deliverance from the gangsters running their country. The streets of Panama Tuesday were filled with citizens demonstrating against the continued rule of Manuel Noreiga, but the odds are a tad unbalanced. The people in the streets are unarmed, while Gen. Noreiga is backed by the 15,000-member defense forces, which put down a hapless coup attempt this week by the local police. Anything the U.S. did to free the Panamanians would have them (and all the U.S. dependents in the Canal Zone) parading through the streets with American flags.    Most likely there at some point will be a speech from Mr. Reagan explaining and defending the Honduran troop movement. And most likely it will be eloquent, forceful and correct. But it would be helpful this time if Mr. Reagan called an Oval-Office huddle for his TV-interview team -- Howard Baker, George Shultz, Marlin Fitzwater and even all the aides with no names -- to ensure that they speak as he speaks. Without apology.    Inside the Beltway, what matters most in all this is whether the outcome leaves Ronald Reagan up or beaten down. The Democrats are howling already that they didn't get their full shot from the Iran-Contra indictments. The American people deserve better. The issues now set before them are Nicaragua, supported by the Warsaw Pact nations, and Panama, most likely supported by the Latin American drug mafia. U.S. troops are sitting in Honduras. It is the task of U.S. leadership to identify America's interests and act accordingly. </TEXT></DOC>
