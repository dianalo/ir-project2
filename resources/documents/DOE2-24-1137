<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-24-1137 </DOCNO><TEXT>This patent discloses an improved process for converting petroleum residuals.The process is accomplished in the presence of a hydrogen donor solvent,molecular hydrogen, a hydrogen partial pressure within the range fromabout 1500 to about 2500 psig and a temperature within the range fromabout 800 to about 850/sup 0/F. Operation at these conditions is essentialto achieving increased conversion and the increased yield of lower boilingliquid products. This patent also describes experiments using this processon vacuum residuals from heavy crude. 4 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
