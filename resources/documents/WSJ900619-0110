But the budget summit in which President Bushis now participating has nothing to do with economic reality.It offers no proper justification for raising taxes or, forthat matter, cutting spending, to reduce the deficit.   One reason the matter is urgent, we are told, is that theneed to bail out the Savings and Loans is making the deficitworse. The Sandamp;Ls may well have made some bad loans andfinanced private spending that was not worthwhile. Or theymay have made long-term loans at rates of interest that haveturned out to be too low. In either event the market value oftheir assets is insufficient to pay off their depositors andother creditors. But all that is water over the dam, or moreaccurately, money down the drain.</LP><TEXT>   If $180 billion of currency were to get washed away in thesewage system -- or burned in a fire -- we would not think ofraising taxes to reimburse the losers. At that point it ispurely a paper matter. We would authorize the printing ofmore money. That would in no way be inflationary; we wouldmerely be replacing the money that had been destroyed.   Failing to replace that money would, to the contrary, bemost deflationary. It would almost certainly bring on afinancial crisis and very likely a sharp recession. Andtaxing the public to get the money to reimburse the loserswould only compound the problem; the wealth of money-loserswould be restored at the expense of the rest of us.   Yet this is exactly the situation with the Sandamp;Ls. Thebailouts do not add to the money of depositors. They merelykeep them from losing their money -- that is, prevent thequantity of money from being reduced. By keeping theirdepositors and other creditors whole we are preventing cashand other financial assets from going down the drain.Refinancing or replacing those collapsing financial assetsdoes not add to the nation's spending or spending power.   The government is not commanding new resources, as itwould when it builds missiles or roads. This is rather afinancial operation, like the pouring in of reserves andliquidity to the banking system that Alan Greenspan and theFed undertook to stop the stock market crash of October 1987;it may merely entail more, and more long-term, financialintervention. Raising taxes to pay for this now is no more inorder than it would have been to bail out stock dealerscaught in the financial squeeze then.   It may be pointed out that loan guarantees or depositinsurance indirectly finance real spending just as they mightif treasury expenditures were made up front. In a sense, theexplicit and implicit deposit insurance or guarantees raisedthe budget deficit at the time the Sandamp;Ls made the loans thatultimately turned bad. There might have been budget footnotesover these past years mentioning these additionalexpenditures and offering a measure of &quot;the deficit&quot;including them.   But the fact is the expenditures were made then. They thenfinanced the now half-empty office buildings or homes worthonly a fraction of their construction costs. Currentgovernment borrowing to finance the purchase of Sandamp;L assetsonly makes explicit an element of deficit or debt that wasimplicit earlier in the commitment of backing to Sandamp;Lliabilities -- the deposits or money of Sandamp;L creditors.Whatever problems of fairness and equity it may impose, andwhatever may be indicated in the way of new arrangements toprevent bad private loan practices in the future, the Sandamp;Lbailout has nothing to do with the current budget deficit.   Regarding the current deficit, and deficits moregenerally, the simple fact is that deficits add to debt. Theydo so for an individual or a business. They do so forgovernments. The question for all is how fast debt is growingand for what purpose.   In a growing economy with more people and more product andincome, debt generally grows. It has in fact been growingvery rapidly for the private sector. One sensible first ruleof thumb is to keep that growth balanced -- that is, to keepdebt growing no faster than income.   For the federal government that means keeping the debtfrom growing faster than the national income, or grossnational product. This would keep the ratio of debt toincome, currently about 42% or three-sevenths, constant. Thatratio has of course been lower but it has also been muchhigher, well over 100% just after World War II, with nodisastrous consequences. And it is not particularly highcompared to other countries.   But the national income and GNP are growing at just about7% per year. Maintaining a constant debt-GNP ratio would thusrequire that the debt grow at 7% a year. With a federal debtheld by the public approaching $2.3 trillion (and a GNParound $5.5 trillion) that implies an increase in the debt of$161 billion.   The deficit, assets sales and accounting gimmicks aside,is exactly equal to the increase in the debt. We would keepour debt in line with our income then by running a deficit of$161 billion -- or 3% of GNP -- which is a bit more than thedeficit we have been running and is not exceeded by even morealarmist projections of the deficit. In a meaningful economicsense, not the sense of Gramm-Rudman, the federal budget isnow in balance, precisely the kind of balance that would bewelcomed by any business trying to travel a road of balancedgrowth.   The really serious problem is not now the size of thegovernment deficit but, as with most individuals orbusinesses, what the borrowing is being used to finance. Ifan individual borrows to finance gambling losses in Las Vegasthat is clearly bad. If a family borrows to invest in a newhome or the children's college education, most of us thinkthat is good. And if business borrows to invest in productivenew plant and equipment, not many of us would be critical.   It should be the same for government at all levels. It ispast time for Mr. Bush and Congress to put behind foolishposturing over mismeasured deficits and to face up to ourreal needs. These are to assure a prosperous economy now andthe real investment, public and private, on which ourprosperity depends.   ---   Mr. Eisner, an economics professor at NorthwesternUniversity, is the author of &quot;The Total Incomes System ofAccounts&quot; (University of Chicago, 1989).</TEXT></DOC>
