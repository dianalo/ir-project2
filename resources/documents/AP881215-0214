The rig Rowan Gorilla I capsized about 1,200 miles east of NewYork City in gale-force winds of 40 to 60 knots and 40-foot seas,the Coast Guard said.   The tugboat Smit London, which had been towing the rig from NovaScotia to Yarmouth, England, remained with the pod, said Lt. Cmdr.Paul Milligan, a Coast Guard spokesman in New York.   Two commercial vessels were heading toward the tug and pod. Theywere about 200 miles away as of 4 p.m. and it was expected to taketwo days to get the crew out of the pod because of weatherconditions, he said. A Canadian P-3 plane was on the scene, he said.   ``The people are safe _ there's nothing that can be done untilthe seas subside,'' Milligan said.   The crew members entered the survival pod, a boat that iscompletely enclosed and contains food and water, about noon when itbecame apparent the rig might capsize, he said.   Nobody was injured when the rig capsized sometime in the earlyafternoon, he said.   The rig, owned by the Rowan Co. Inc. of Houston, capsized but didnot sink, and will probably be salvaged, Milligan said.   The crew consists of 25 Canadians and one American, he said.   But Maj. Glen Urquhart, a spokesman for search and rescueoperations in Halifax, Nova Scotia, said 27 people were in the pod,including two women. He said they were 25 Canadians, one Americanand one Dutch crew member.   ``Apparently they're a little bit seasick, but aside from that wehaven't had any other adverse reports,'' he said.   Tim Brownlow, a Rowan crew member who had been scheduled to meetthe rig in Europe, said the life pod has enough food and water fordays and can stay afloat in the roughest weather.   ``Have you ever put a cork in a bathtub? That's what it's like,''said Brownlow, who has worked on oil rigs for eight years. ``They'rea self-righting capsule. They can flip, flip, flip and it will keeprighting itself.   ``There will be some sick puppies tonight.''   The rig began listing after one of its ballast tanks cracked andbegan taking in water, said Danny McNease, vice president ofoperations for the Rowan Co. He said the rig, about 300 feet wideand 300 feet long, was built to withstand 100-foot waves and 80 mphwinds.   The rig, which is not under lease to an oil company, left Halifaxlast week for the 30-day trip across the Atlantic to the North Sea.It can carry 86 men. It is a jack-up rig, meaning its platform sitsatop huge legs that are embedded in the sea floor during drilling.</TEXT></DOC>
