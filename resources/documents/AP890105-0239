But he said that he shared with the new Mexican president``optimism about the possibilities of a stabilization of thepetroleum market soon.''   Perez, who will be inaugurated Feb. 2, said tentative stepstoward strengthening the oil market could be made during a meetingof representatives from non-OPEC governments scheduled for lateJanuary in London.   Venezuela is a founding member of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries, the 13-nation price-fixing cartel that in thepast was unable to limit its members' oil exports to bolster prices.   Perez said he was optimistic OPEC would be able to keep pricesfrom falling further.   Mexico, the world's sixth largest oil producer, is not a memberof OPEC but closely follows the cartel's pricing and productionguidelines. About half the oil that Pemex, the Mexican statepetroleum monopoly, sells abroad goes to the United States.   He also said he and Salinas discussed the foreign debt, which hesaid acted like ``a vise on the economy'' of Venezuela. He said thetwo leaders agreed to continue discussions on the debt with otherLatin American heads of state, and announced he planned to visitPresident Jose Sarney of Brazil later this week.   ``We seek agreement among Latin American countries to findreasonable solutions with our creditors,'' Perez declared earlierWednesday.   He said he believed the United States, under President-electGeorge Bush, could help Latin America overcome its foreign debtburden.   ``We will have the opportunity for great (American) cooperationwith our countries in Latin America, great opportunities fordevelopment,'' said Perez, who met recently with Bush.   Venezuela on Saturday suspended principal payments on most of its$26 billion in foreign bank debt, claiming it was short of moneybecause of low prices for its crude oil exports. Mexico is trying torenegotiate payments on its $106 billion debt, the second largestafter Brazil's among developing countries.   Both nations say debt payments don't leave enough money forinvestment and economic growth.   He said Venezuela's decision to suspend debt payments was takenafter exhausting all efforts to comply with its commitments. Themeasure also was taken ``to ask for a fairer treatment'' fromcreditors, he said.   Perez said if no solution is found to the debt problem, thesevere economic difficulties of Venezuela, Brazil and Mexico couldextend to other countries.   Perez said he will seek ``rational negotiations'' after he takesoffice ``in search of understanding and not confrontation.'' He saidVenezuela's export income amounted to $7 billion in 1988, while debtservicing totalled $5.6 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
