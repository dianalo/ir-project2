In East Berlin, Communist leader Egon Krenz urged closereconomic ties to the West and said a new law permitting freedom oftravel to the West would be announced Monday. Several top Communistofficials resigned, including the wife of ousted leader ErichHonecker.   At least 8,000 East Germans swarmed into Czechoslovakia afterEast Germany lifted a month-old travel ban on Wednesday, theofficial East German news agency ADN said. It is the only countryEast Germans can visit freely.   Most of those flooding into the embassy in Prague were in theirearly 20s. At least 200 to 300 children could be seen behind afence playing peacefully in the embassy grounds.   ``We want reforms without borders,'' said one of the newarrivals, a 24-year-old trucker from Leipzig.   ``I don't believe that anything will change there,'' saidanother young man who declined to give his name. ``The reforms areonly for the outside world.''   As darkness shrouded the embassy, East Germans continued toarrive, with at least 20 people gaining entry in just one 15-minutespell.   The refugees simply walked in through the giant wooden doors ofthe Palais Lobkowicz, the elegant Baroque palace that houses theWest German Embassy in Prague's ancient Mala Strana district.   A Czech policeman outside the embassy said he and his colleagueshad orders not to interfere with any East Germans seeking entrancebecause this was a matter for the two Germanys alone.   Several refugees chatted with reporters through the railings ofthe embassy garden, some sipping beer and listening to music.Others waved from upper-floor windows in the embassy.   Shipments of tents were ordered from West Germany to cope withwhat embassy sources expected would be a renewed influx over theweekend. West German Red Cross helpers and medical supplies weredispatched from Bonn.   East Germany has agreed to allow East Germans at the embassy andat the West German Embassy in Warsaw to renounce their citizenshipand go to West Germany, which automatically gives them a newpassport and assistance in starting a new life.   East German diplomats are processing only about 100 people a dayin Prague, and more than 1,000 are still waiting in the West GermanEmbassy in Warsaw.   East German Ambassador Helmut Ziebart urged his countrymen toseek legal emigration in East Germany, rather than go through othercountries. But many complained that it takes years for suchrequests to be granted.   West German coaches were used to ferry the processed EastGermans to the Czech border with Bavaria at Waidhaus. Some EastGermans who boarded a bus Thursday appeared rather drunk, witnessessaid.   Czechoslovakia's normally conservative state-run media, whichgave only scant reports on the exodus of 15,000 East Germansthrough Prague last month, swiftly reported the latest arrivals.   More than 70,000 East Germans have fled their homeland throughHungary and Bonn's embassies in Prague and Warsaw since August.   On Oct. 3, Honecker banned travel to Czechoslovakia to try tohalt the mass emigration of young, skilled workers badly needed inhis labor-intensive economy.   But the exodus and pressure for reform led to Honecker's ousterOct. 18. Krenz, who is trying to bolster the Communist Party'ssagging authority with promises of reform and foreign travel,lifted the ban.   Krenz faces mounting pressure for Solidarity-style reforms inEast Germany, where tens of thousands have repeatedly taken to thestreets to press for more democracy.   On Thursday in Warsaw, he discussed reforms with Poland'sSolidarity Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the firstnon-communist premier in the East bloc. Back in East Berlin, hetold reporters he wanted closer ties with the European EconomicCommunity and called for a quick trade agreement.   Krenz spoke after talks with Martin Bangemann, an EECcommissioner from West Germany. Bangemann said he was told by Krenzthat a new law permitting freedom of travel to the West would beannounced on Monday.   Two regional Communist Party bosses were replaced, the chief ofthe Communist-controlled trade unions federation stepped down andthe leader of a Communist-allied political party resigned, ADNreported.   The resignation of Margot Honecker as education minister wasannounced by the state-run news agency ADN following a cabinetmeeting. Mrs. Honecker, 62, had held the post since 1963.</TEXT></DOC>
