Banc One, which was considered a strong potential bidderfor the bank, said that New England's weak economy hasn't hitbottom and that better opportunities lie elsewhere. But Bankof Boston, whose bidding was dependent on getting a capitalinfusion, has finalized commitments from a group of investorsthat includes insurance companies, Warren Buffett, leveragedbuyout specialist Thomas H. Lee and others.</LP><TEXT>   The surprise decision by Columbus, Ohio-based Banc One --which previously indicated it would bid -- is considered asetback for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. although itwill strengthen the hand of other bidders. The FDIC had hopedas many as a dozen bidders might emerge, pushing up the priceand reducing the federal government's cost of seizing Bank ofNew England. In the past week, Boston-based UST Corp. andCoreStates Financial Corp. of Philadelphia also decidedagainst bidding. &quot;The more players we have, the better welike it,&quot; said Alan Whitney, an FDIC spokesman.   Still left in the field of expected bidders, along withBank of Boston, are San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corp. andleveraged buy-out firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. and theProvidence, R.I.-based Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc.,which are reportedly planning a joint bid. Chase ManhattanCorp. also may make a bid for part of Bank of New England.The deadline for bids is Friday.   Despite its own troubles stemming from the weakened NewEngland economy, Bank of Boston nonetheless could make acompetitive bid because it could generate far greater costsavings in combining with Bank of New England than otherbidders.   People close to Bank of Boston estimate that the investorgroup will provide a capital infusion of about $500 million,an amount in line with what FDIC officials recently said theywill require as the minimum amount of capital needed to bid.The FDIC's calculations are based on capital of between 3%and 4% of $14 billion in assets that will remain at the Bankof New England once the FDIC assumes the bank's bad assets ofabout $6 billion.   Companies with executives on Bank of Boston's board --including Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. and MassachusettsMutual Life Insurance Co., both based in Massachusetts -- areleading the investor group, a source said. Bank of Boston andall of the investors declined comment.   The willingness of these investors to provide capital fora Bank of Boston bid contrasts sharply with the reluctanceexpressed by Banc One.   Banc One initially thought that by acquiring Bank of NewEngland it could repeat the success it had two years ago whenit bought 20 failed MCorp banks in Texas. But Banc OneChairman John B. McCoy said he now believes that can't happenbecause the Texas economy, while still fragile, is farstronger than New England's. &quot;Texas had five or six years ofdifficulty, whereas Boston has only had one,&quot; he said. &quot;Onequestion we had was, `What pulls the New England economyout?'&quot;   Mr. McCoy said the Bank of New England transaction wouldhave precluded him from doing another deal for two years.With banks faltering across the nation, Mr. McCoy figures hecan find better opportunities than Bank of New England.   Mr. McCoy also said he lost interest in Bank of NewEngland because Banc One is now trying to raise between $200million and $250 million in preferred stock. Banc One fearedthat investors who weren't keen on the New England bank mayhave stayed away from the offering.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          BANK OF BOSTON Corp. refused to confirm or deny a report,based on sources close to the bank, that an investor grouphas agreed to provide capital necessary for Bank of Boston tomake a bid for Bank of New England. In yesterday's edition,it was incorrectly stated that Bank of Boston itself had saidit has come up with the needed capital.   (WSJ March 28, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
