A number of radionuclide imagingtechniques have proved disappointing when approached from a purely anatomicpoint of view. This is particularly evident to our colleagues with theexplosive growth of the noninvasive imaging procedures, magnetic resonanceimaging (NMR), CT, and ultrasound, and the introduction of the less invasivedigital radiographic approach to vascular opacification, all of whichare capable of providing exquisite anatomic or tissue detail beyond thereach of current or reasonably priced nuclear medicine imaging systems.Yet, most nuclear medicine procedures possess the unique advantage ofportraying a physiologic function without interfering with that function.Moreover, the procedures can be employed under conditions of stress,which are likely to bring out pathophysiologic abnormalities that remainmasked when unchallenged. Information concerning form without functionaldata has less meaning than both together. The physiologic informationinherent in nuclear medicine imaging may often provide not only key diagnosticinformation but also illuminate a therapeutic trail. Yet, it is oftenslighted in favor of the anatomic quest. While mastery of the nuancesof imaging details remains critical, radionuclide image interpretationmust rest upon a firm physiologic foundation. For this reason, this chapteremphasizes the physiologic approach.</TEXT></DOC>
