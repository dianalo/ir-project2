The howl marks the beginning of the Kyrie Eleison in theEarth Mass celebrated annually in October for the Feast of St. Francis.;  Soon other voices join -- musician Paul Winter on his oboe, a human choir of300 and a number of inspired dogs in the congregation. The exuberant choruswould no doubt please St. Francis of Assisi, the 12th-century Italian saintwho befriended the wolf of Gubbio and preached about human kinship to othercreatures.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Religion andamp; Ethics  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE GREENING OF RELIGIONCHURCHES, ENVIRONMENTALISTS SEARCH FOR COMMONGROUND  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Environment  </MEMO><TEXT>     Two decades ago, when historian Lynn White wrote a scathing essay indictingChristianity as &quot;the most anthropocentric religion the world has seen seen,&quot;St. Francis was the only Christian figure he exempted from blame for theworld's developing environmental crisis.;   White's attack on Christianitystill holds sway among many environmentalists. Other thoughtful commentators,however, have argued persuasively that the connection between humanexploitation of nature and religion, Christian or otherwise, is far morecomplex. If official religion so powerfully determines human actions, why,they ask, has the exploitation of the environment been equally ruthless inJapan, where the religious tradition is more nature-friendly?;   Even if thelinks aren't so simple, a growing number in the religious and environmentalcommunity who have wrestled with this question say there are indeedconnections, deep ones, between religion  and environmental concerns. WhileWhite's arguments still lead some environmentalists to reject religionaltogether, others have responded to the environmental crisis by rethinkingold religions or looking for new ones.;   &quot;There's a natural affinity,&quot; saysauthor and journalist Margot Adler, whose search for an &quot;ecological religion&quot;led her to the growing neo-pagan movement. Both religion and environmentalconcerns &quot;make you think about the big questions,&quot; about who you are and whereyou fit in the scheme of things, she said.;   In fact, it was the spiritualityshe found in early environmental writers such as John Muir and Thoreau thatspurred her to seek out the burgeoning revival in Earth-centered religions.Her book, &quot;Drawing Down the Moon,&quot; describes what she found.;   Many who startfrom the religious tradition also see the connections as natural andcompelling.;   The Rev. James Parks Morton, the Episcopal dean of theCathedral of St. John the Divine, where the Earth Mass is held, argues thatthe environmental crisis is at its heart &quot;a religious issue . . . one of themost sacred issues there is. We have been bad stewards. We are destroyingGod's creation.&quot;;   Thanks in part to his efforts, this view is beginning togain ground among spiritual leaders in the U.S. religious mainstream. At ameeting in New York last June, senior religious leaders from major faiths anddenominations pledged to make the environmental crisis a top priority on thereligious agenda.;   Within the mainstream groups, individuals are digginginto their traditions to find those teachings and individuals, such as St.Francis, that speak to the current situation.;   In Morton's view, thegreening of the American religious community is finally under way, and itsmoral weight could be critical in the environmental struggles that lie ahead.;  &quot;The most profound role churches have always played is that of moralarbiter,&quot; he explains. &quot;They point to the crises and the deepest meaning of asituation. Think of the role the churches played on the abolition issue. Thisis an issue of that spiritual magnitude.&quot;;   For many with roots in theenvironmental community, green spirituality -- whether in the Christian,Jewish, neo-pagan tradition or another -- nurtures the heart and spirit.;  Many people involved in environmental causes feel &quot;there is somethingmissing,&quot; says Andras Corban Arthen of the EarthSpirit Community, a neo-pagannetwork of about 3,000 people based in Medford, Mass. Besides wanting torectify the environmental crisis, they want &quot;to get involved in a personalprocess of being more in tune with nature. And there is something sacred aboutthat, something spiritual.&quot;;   Some say this added dimension of experiencehelps them to ward off the despair that comes so easily to those whocontemplate global prospects. Working on daunting issues of social change suchas the environment can be &quot;very exhausting,&quot; says Rachel Stark of EcospiritNew England, an interfaith group exploring religion and the environment.;  But comfort and strength are only a part of what they find.;   After severalyears of secular environmental work, Ellen Bernstein returned to Judaism tofind the joy and celebration she says were so absent from the vision ofmainstream environmental groups. Her group, Shomrei Adamah or Keepers of theEarth, based near Philadelphia, is seeking to renew &quot;Jewish ecologicalwisdom.&quot;;   Bernstein is particularly fond of the Sukkot, a fall harvestfestival that hasn't been celebrated much in modern times. Old tradition, shesays, commands people to build a little hut, with a roof open to the stars,and eat and sleep there for seven days. And it specifically obliges them to bejoyful and celebrate the fruits of the Earth.;   &quot;I believe the world would bea very different place if . . . all the Jews in the world were sleepingoutside for a week in a Sukkot,&quot; says Bernstein.;   New York's St. John theDivine, which has been dubbed the &quot;green cathedral,&quot; takes celebration asseriously as recycling and other aspects of its extensive and innovativeenvironmental program.;   For the feast of St. Francis, celebrated this yearon Oct. 6, it pulled out all the stops in a wild, colorful, joyful celebrationof life in all its splendid diversity. In the spirit of the good saint, fellowcreatures were welcome, so the congregation included hundreds of dogs, catsand birds and other pets.;   During the three-hour Earth Mass, the cathedralthrobbed with life, mixing whale songs and African drumming with the medievalpomp of the high Episcopal church.;   At the climax, the congregation fellsilent and the cathedral, in an act both literal and symbolic, threw its hugebrass doors open to the rest of creation. Down the great central aisle inprocession came an elephant with a garland about its neck, a mouse carried bya child, an elegant barn owl, a furry spider, a camel, a cedar tree, rainforest orchids and bromeliads, a hive of bees, and a 3.5 billion-year-old rockfrom Australia bearing the fossil imprint of blue-green algae -- one of themost ancient forms of life.;   In the hush of the great cathedral, there was afeeling of homecoming. And delight and wonder and mystery.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DIANNE DUMANOSKI, Boston Globe  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911123  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,127  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, November 23, 199100328095,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
