Phantomstudies with Tc-99m were made to examine how parameters influence spatialresolution and uniformity of SPECT in QA testing, as well as how thecorrection of degraded images influence them. Spatial resolution measurementwas based on point spread function (PSF) and the ability to detect coldspot. The optimal distance between line sources was found to be morethan full width at tenth maximum (FWTM) of PSF. The adequate locationof line sources was needed to study the shape of PSF. The diameter ofline sources less than 2 mm had scarecely effects on spatial resolutionmeasurement. In preparing profile curves, the width corresponding tothe full width at half maximum had only minor effects on measurementerror of spatial resolution. Slight differences in the ability of coldspot was clarified by using contrast values. Image degradation was causedby statistical variation and intrinsic nonuniformity of gamma cameras.Scatter correction decreased FWTM. Contrast values were increased byscatter correction, and were decreased by attenuation correction. Thedegree of uniformity of reconstructed images were increased by uniformsensitivity correction of gamma cameras and attenuation correction, andwas decreased by scatter correction.
