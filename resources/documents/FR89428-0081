OSHAis developing a standard to protect workers from occupational exposureto bloodborne diseases, particularly the hepatitis B virus and the humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV). The survey will support an assessment ofthe economic and technological feasibility of a standard by providing dataon the population at risk, the extent of exposure, and the extent to whichfacilities have adopted measures to protect workers. This will be a onetime only telephone survey. OSHA estimates that there will be 2669 non-responseor screening only respondents requiring 5 minutes per response and 2245completed surveys from respondents requiring an average of 30 minutes perresponse for an average of 16 minutes per total responses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>OSHA has requested an expedited review of this submissionunder the Paperwork Reduction Act to be completed by May 30, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Comments and questions aboutthis survey or the reporting burden should be directed to Paul E.

To collect thedata necessary for the economic and technological assessment of the finalstandard, OSHA must adhere to the schedule set forth below. As a firststep, OSHA is submitting the following clearance package to OMB in a requestfor approval of the survey contained in Appendix I. <ITAG tagnum="84">Supporting Statement for Survey and Related Data Gathering to SupportOSHA Rulemaking on Bloodborne Diseases</ITAG>A. Justification<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Necessity of Data Collection</ITAG>The Office of Regulatory Analysis of the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration (OSHA) is collecting data to support an assessment of thetechnological and economic feasibility of a standard to protect workersfrom occupational exposure to certain bloodborne diseases, primarily thehepatitis B virus (HBV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Healthcare and certain other workers are at increased risk for certain infectiousdiseases due to their exposure to blood and other potentially infectiousbody fluids. Occupational exposure takes place in a variety of ways, themost common being injuries from needles and other sharp instruments andthe contamination of open wounds from blood splash. These exposures arecommon, not just in medical personnel but in workers indirectly involvedin the handling of potentially infectious body fluids.OSHA has at this time no specific standard regulating exposure to biologicalhazards such as viruses. In 1983 the agency issued guidelines in conjunctionwith the Department of Health and Human Services for reducing the risksof occupational exposure to HBV. In 1988 the agency issued enforcementprocedures providing uniform inspection procedures and guidelines to befollowed when conducting inspections and issuing citations under section5(a)(1) of the Act for occupational exposure to both HBV and HIV.OSHA has developed a proposed section 6(b) rule to protect workers frombloodborne diseases. The proposal includes provisions for safe work practices,personal protective equipment, training, post-exposure protocol and, inthe case of HBV, a vaccination program.OSHA's Congressional mandate stipulates that the agency carefully designand study its regulatory proposals. Section 6(b)(5) of the OSHA Act 2dU.S.C. 655 (b)(5) mandates that regulations promulgated by the Agency shallmost adequately assure worker safety and health ``to the extent feasibleon the basis of the best available evidence.'' They are to be based on``research and the latest available scientific data.'' Section 6(f) ofthe Act requires regulations to be justified by ``substantial evidencein the record'' and authorizes the Secretary of Labor ``to enter into contracts,agreements or other arrangements with appropriate public agencies or privateorganizations for the purposes of conducting studies related to his responsibilityunder the Act.'' The courts have endorsed the view that technological andeconomic factors affect the feasibility of proposed regulations. Thus,OSHA is obligated to gather data on the technological feasibility, costof compliance, and economic consequences of future standards. Executive Order 12291 reiterates this obligation by requiring the preparationof preliminary and final Regulatory Impact Analyses for each major rule.The Agency must analyze the potential benefits and costs of the rule andalternative approaches. The Regulatory Impact Analysis may be combinedwith the analysis required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This Actspecifically requires an analysis that describes the ``impact of the proposedrule on small entities'' and significant regulatory alternatives that ``takeinto account the resources available to small entities.''In order to fulfill the Congressional and Presidential mandates and tobetter evaluate the economic and technological feasibility of the finalOSHA standard, OSHA requires a data base that describes current industrypractices and identifies situations where potential hazards exist. Thus,in accordance with section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Actof 1970, 29 U.S.C. 655, OSHA is planning to gather statistically accuratedata through a survey to assess the extent to which the various types offacilities affected have already implemented infection control measuresto protect workers from these infectious diseases and the direct and indirectcosts associated with each of these measures. As discussed below, noneof the available data sources are adequate for this purpose.To estimate accurately the cost of the standard, data are needed on baselinecompliance rates by facility for specific provisions of the standard. OSHAalso needs an estimate of the proportion of each type of facility thatis at various levels of compliance for each provision of the standard.Currently the data available for estimating the extent to which facilitieshave adopted measures to protect workers from bloodborne pathogens is extremelylimited or outdated. In addition, most of the data available to OSHA arenot based on a random sample, and thus their accuracy cannot be judged.The data that do exist are for the most part over a year old, and are mostlyfrom large, urban hospitals in areas which report a high incidence of HBVand HIV infection. In some facility types, notably physicians' offices,there are almost no data on current compliance levels. Moreover, thoseon compliance that exist do not allow an estimate of the extent to whicha facility may have adopted measures which would, at least in part, meetthe requirements of the proposed standards.In addition to estimates of compliance rates, data are needed on a varietyof specific aspects of a facility's operation. For example, data on thenumber of incidents of employee exposure to blood or materials contaminatedwith blood are needed to estimate the cost of the post-exposure protocol.All existing data on exposure rates are for hospitals or atypical facilities.Similarly, facility-specific data are needed to estimate the number ofworkers that are at risk.A timetable for the survey is presented in Figure A-1. The timetable showsthat OSHA is attempting to complete the survey within a short period oftime in order to permit completion of the final regulatory analysis inconjunction with the final rule. The schedule currently calls for completionof the bulk of the survey effort within a 10-week period. Therefore, werequest that an expedited review be performed by OMB.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Uses of the Information</ITAG>The data gathered through this survey will be used by OSHA to make estimatesof the direct and indirect costs of the various provisions for safe workpractices, personal protective equipment, training, post-exposure followup and HBV vaccination. The information gathered from all of the data collectionefforts will be used by OSHA to prepare a final Regulatory Impact Analysis(RIA) for the final rule. Executive Order 12291 requires preparation ofan RIA for each major rule. In an RIA, the Agency must assess the potentialbenefits and costs of the rule and of alternative approaches.The discussion below describes in detail the data uses for responses toeach set of questions in the survey instrument.A. <T3>Introduction and Collection of Identification Data. </T3>The firstelements of the survey instrument describe the telephone survey in generaland determine whether the respondent is in the facility type anticipatedby the survey design. If the respondent is not in the anticipated facilitytype, the survey will be concluded.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/>Figure A-1_<T3>Schedule for Design and Completion</T3><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Complete design of survey instrument and submit information collectionplan to OMB <D>April 15, 1989.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Publish <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice of survey submission to OMB <D>April 15, 1989.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Obtain sampling frames for each sample stratum <D>April 15, 1989.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Receive OMB approval of survey (expedited) <D>May 15, 1989.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mail notification letters to survey targets <D>May 16, 1989.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Begin telephone interviewing <D>June 1, 1989.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Complete telephone interviewing <D>July 1, 1989.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Perform data tabulations <D>July 15, 1989.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Integrate survey results into a draft final report <D>August 1, 1989.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Respond to comments and submit final report <D>August 15, 1989.</D></ITAG></ITAG>B. <T3>Data Collection on Types of Activities and Employment. </T3>The nextquestions identify the size of the facility in terms of revenue, specificservices performed and employment. This section also collects informationon the rate of job turnover and growth in employment in the facilities.These factors have an important effect on the cost of the training andthe HBV vaccination program aspects of the proposal.C. <T3>Questions on Infection Control Policies. </T3>This set of questionsidentifies whether the facility has written infection control policiesand the general nature of those policies. The type of policy will providea general indication of the facility's compliance level and a quality controlcheck on later responses.D. <T3>Data on Rates of Employee Exposure. </T3>The next questions ask forestimates of the proportion of workers that are potentially exposed toblood or materials contaminated with blood. In addition, information issolicited on the number of exposed workers employed by subcontractors.The information on these workers and persons not covered by the standard,self employed workers and volunteers, will provide a more complete understandingof the distribution of exposure within facilities.E. <T3>Questions on Personal Protective Equipment. </T3>The industries coveredby this data collection were not included in the OSHA survey on personalprotective equipment. Questions are asked here regarding the quantity ofvarious gloves used and the extent to which this use would increase ifthe facility adopted a policy that followed the elements of the proposedstandard. Where appropriate, additional questions are asked regarding theuse of masks, goggles, shields and gowns.F. <T3>Questions on Medical Surveillance. </T3>Questions are asked to determinethe percentage of exposed workers who have received the HBV vaccination,the extent to which these workers are offered the HBV vaccine free of charge,and when appropriate, the proportion of workers that accept the vaccine.In addition to the vaccination program, data are collected on the facility'sprotocol to respond to exposure incidents. To estimate the cost of thepost-exposure protocol in the proposed standard, data are collected onthe number of incidents in 1988, and the types of tests the facility administersfor the source patient and the exposed worker.G. <T3>Questions Concerning Housekeeping. </T3>The largest potential costassociated with the housekeeping provisions of the proposal concerns thedisposal of infectious waste, and needles and other sharp instruments (knownin the affected industries as ``sharps''). Consequently, data are collectedon the quantity of potentially infectious waste now generated and the quantityof waste that would be considered potentially infectious under a policyconsistent with the proposal. Data are also collected on the quantity ofsharps disposal containers that are now used and that would be used undera policy consistent with the proposal.H. <T3>Questions Concerning Training. </T3>Data are collected on the lengthand frequency of infection control training provided by the facility. Tominimize the burden on the respondent, OSHA will estimate from other sourcesthe reasonable length of time necessary for a training program to coverall the elements called for in the standard.Because OSHA has not regulated infectious diseases before this time anddoes not have a substantial amount of experience with the types of workplacesthat would be affected, the Agency needs the information that this surveywould provide in order to refine the proposed standard.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Use of Technology to Reduce Burden </ITAG>Information for this survey will be collected using a Computer AssistedTelephone Interviewing (CATI) system. Such a procedure will improve thequality and efficiency of the survey in a number of ways and will alsoreduce respondent burden. First, since the survey is done via telephone,there is no need for scheduling on-site visits to gather the information.This is expected to increase both the response rate and reduce the costand time of completing interviews. Respondents are also not being askedto fill out a long questionnaire form on their operations. Further, CATI system responses are entered directly into the computer,eliminating the need for separate recording and coding operations. Also,the computer ensures that the proper sequence of questions is followedautomatically. For example, if the response to one question suggests thata follow-up question can be skipped, the computer will automatically moveon. The interviewer simply reads the questions as they appear on the screen.In addition, the use of CATI allows the interviewer to omit questions thatwould not be relevant for the particular industry being questioned. Forexample, the questions regarding work with concentrated amounts of thehepatitis-B or the AIDS virus would not be asked of establishments suchas corrections facilities or police departments. This system produces asmoothly flowing interview and eliminates any pauses or delays by the interviewerto enter responses by hand or to find the next question. In essence, thecomputer produces a questionnaire tailored to each industry sector. Thereare no technical or legal obstacles to these plans for reducing the burden.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Efforts to Identify Duplication </ITAG>OSHA and its contractor, Jack Faucett Associates, Inc., have conductedan extensive literature review and have explored sources within governmentaland private agencies for data that are to be collected from these surveys.The findings indicate that there are no attempts to gather, in a systematicfashion, data on the work practices and the costs of control measures toprotect workers from occupationally related exposures to bloodborne diseasesin the various industries and facility types affected by the rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Availability of the Data from Existing Sources </ITAG>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is preparing a survey of hospitalpractices in this area. As a consequence, the sample frame proposed inthis survey excludes hospitals. Instead, OSHA has suggested to CDC questionsthat would be useful for the Agency's analysis. There have been several surveys estimating the level of compliance withsome aspects of the standard. The Academy of General Dentistry conducteda survey in September of 1987 of practices regarding infectious diseasecontrol in private dental practices. This survey, while useful in developingthe preliminary RIA, did not collect data on the usage <T3>rate</T3> of various personal protective equipment and other importantinformation. Most important, it is very likely that compliance rates indental offices have increased significantly since the AGD survey was conducted.The Service Employees International Union (SEUI) surveyed workers at avariety of facilities to estimate compliance with various infection controlpractices. Like the AGD survey, the SEIU data were useful in developingthe preliminary RIA but do not cover all the areas of interest. In addition,the small sample size and non-random selection of facilities limits theusefulness of these date. There have been a number of surveys and studies analyzing the cost effectivenessof HBV vaccination programs, but these studies are limited to specific,non-randomly selected sets of hospitals. CDC collects information regarding the incidence of bloodborne diseasesin their national medial surveillance, but these data lack informationregarding occupationally related exposures to these infections, and donot address current work practices or control costs.  <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Minimizing Small Employer Burden </ITAG>Over 90 percent of the establishments surveyed will be small. To reducethe burden on these facilities, both the total number of facilities surveyedand the number of questions asked have been kept to a minimum. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Consequence of Less Frequent Collection </ITAG>This is a one time only data collection. No plans exist for subsequentperiodic follow up of this survey.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Consistency with 5 CFR 1320.6</ITAG>There are no special circumstances that require the collection of informationin any manner inconsistent with the guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Expert Review of the Survey Questionnaire</ITAG>The survey design team has had discussions with industry experts in orderto assess the substance of the survey questions. The clarity of instructionsand other specific survey design elements have been reviewed by contractorsurvey experts, OSHA personnel and expert safety consultants in industry.A. The survey instrument has been reviewed in March of 1989 by:<ITAG tagnum="15">Dr. Hugh Conway, Office of Regulatory Analysis, OSHA 202-523-7283;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Mr. Larry Braslow, Office of Regulatory Analysis, OSHA 202-523-7283;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Mr. Robert Andrei, Office of Regulatory Analysis, OSHA 202-523-7283;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Mr. Michael Lawrence, Jack Faucett Associates, 301-961-8800;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Mr. Jack Smalligan, Jack Faucett Associates, 301-961-8800;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Dr. Arnold Greenland, Washington Consulting Group, Inc., 202-457-0233;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Mr. Richard Gruberg, Washington Consulting Group, Inc., 202-457-0233;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Dr. Robert Hiett, KCA Research, Inc., 703-642-5220.</ITAG>B. No major problems arose during this review.C. Public comment will be solicited through the Federal Register noticefor the study, and through notification to the trade associations for theaffected industries.<ITAG tagnum="81">10. Confidentiality</ITAG>Procedures have been developed to protect the confidentiality of the collecteddata. These measures are summarized below:A. All contractor and subcontractor personnel will be given instructionsregarding the importance of keeping all information they obtain from respondentsconfidential.B. The data will be collected using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing(CATI) system. This technology enables the survey responses to be automaticallywritten to a computer data file. Neither the name of the company nor therespondent will appear in the data file. A listing of respondents willbe kept separately in a locked file cabinet at the contractor's office,and will be destroyed when no longer needed. The respondents' names willbe linked to the data base through a unique number assigned at the timeof the interview.D. Publication of study results will be of a statistical nature only. Respondentswill never be identified in any publication or presentation, nor will theirnames be made available to other individuals or groups.<ITAG tagnum="81">11. Senstitive Questions</ITAG>The proposed survey instrument contains no questions of a sensitive nature.<ITAG tagnum="81">12. Costs</ITAG>The total one-time cost to the government of the proposed data collectionis $225,000. This estimate includes costs incurred by contractors for administrationand operation of the data collection, tabulation of survey results, andsubsequent analyses. The total one-time cost to industry is estimated tobe $27,505 (using 30 minutes per facility for complete responses and 5minutes/facility for screening or refusals)].<ITAG tagnum="81">13. Estimate of Respondent Reporting Burden</ITAG>The survey instruments have been designed to allow the respondent to provideestimates and approximations. It is not the intent of the survey to requirerespondents to compile new data. Where data are requested, the survey instrumentsnote that reference is being made to data which the respondent should beable to estimate readily or access easily.It is estimated that 30 minutes will be required for the completion ofthe survey. Based on 2,245 respondents, the respondent burden for completedsurveys will be approximately 1,123 hours. For non-complete responses (screeningor refusals), the burden will be 222 hours. The total respondent burdenwill be 1,345 hours. The respondent burden is summarized below.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,b2,tp0,p6,6/7,i1,s10,8,7,6,8</C> <H1>Type of respondent</H1><H1>Number of respondents</H1><H1>Average completion time (min.)</H1><H1>Total burden (hrs.)</H1><H1>Respondent cost\1\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Non-response or screening only <D>2,669 </D><D>5 </D><D>222 </D><D>$4,540</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Complete <D>2,245 </D><D>30 </D><D>1,123 </D><D>22,965</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>4,914 </D><D> </D><D>1,345 </D><D>27,505</D><F>\1\ Based on an administrative wage rate of $20.45 per hour includingfringe benefits.</F></ITAG></ITAG>OSHA's 1989 information collection budget (ICB) allocated 1,500 hours tothis survey.

Characterization of the Universe and Sample</ITAG>To collect data sufficient for the development of a Regulatory Impact Analysis,a probability sample will be taken from each of the 18 industries listedin Table 1.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s10,10</C><T4>Table 1_Sample Stratification</T4><H1>Description</H1><H1>SIC \1\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Offices of MD's, Osteopaths, Podiatrists <D>8011, 8031, 8043</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Offices of Dentists <D>8021</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nursing Homes <D>805</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Medical and Dental Labs <D>807</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Outpatient Care <D>8082, 8092, 8093</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="13">Home Health Care.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="13">Kidney Dialysis Centers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="13">Hospices.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="13">Drug Treatment Centers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Blood Banks and Blood Plasma Centers <D>8099</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Residential Care <D>8361</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Personal Services <D>7363</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Funeral Services <D>7261</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Health Units in Industry <D>20-48</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Research Labs <D>283, 8221, 8731, 8733</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Non-Volunteer Fire and Rescue Services <D>9224</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Correctional Institutions <D>9223</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Police <D>9221</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Medical Equipment Repair <D>384</D><F>\1\ Based on 1987 edition of SIC manual.</F></ITAG></ITAG>This universe was reviewed carefully from the perspective of the proposedstandard. OSHA considers workers in these industries to have a significantprobability of exposure to bloodborne diseases. Hospitals are not includedin this data collection effort since the Centers for Disease Control areplanning to conduct a similar survey for this particular industry. Companyhealth units are limited to those existing in establishments having 500employees or more as it is believed that such facilities are most likelyto have doctors and nurses employed on the premises. Universe establishment counts and proposed sample sizes are presented inTable 2. The sources to be used for the sampling of this universe are givenin Table 3. Much of this universe is derived from the Dun and Bradstreetdatabase. For those particular industries where the Dun and Bradstreetdatabase is weak (eg., fire and police protection) or does not allow forsampling of highly specialized establishments without extensive screening(eg., bloodbanks), alternative sources are used. During the data collectioneffort, OSHA intends to contact approximately 4914 firms (of which approximately3740 are estimated to be ``affected'') to produce 2245 useable responses.This response rate is based on OSHA's experience with previous surveysof industry employing similar collection methodologies. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,i1,s200,7,10,10,10,10</C><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Number of Firms and Sample Sizes for Industries To Be Surveyed </T4><H1>Description </H1><H1>Cell </H1><H1>Total facilities </H1><H1>Precision (RSE) </H1><H1>Required completes </H1><H1>Total No. of solicitations </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Offices of MD's andamp;

For thescreening, it is anticipated that 1 in 3.8 establishments in PersonnelServices (7361) has employees working with or exposed to blood products(i.e., those providing nursing services); 1 in 3.6 private research labs;1 in 1.3 establishments for health units in industry; and 1 in 2.9 medicalequipment manufacturers. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Information Collection Procedures </ITAG>As described above, independent random samples will be selected from eachindustry, allowing statistical estimates to be made at levels of precisionindicated by Table 2. The precision levels are expressed in terms of relativestandard error (RSE), defined as the standard error of the estimate dividedby the estimate. All sample sizes have been derived to achieve a confidencelevel of 95 percent that cost estimates as described below are within plusor minus (1.96 andmultiply; RSE) of actual values. In general, smaller RSEvalues were assigned to industries where the expected cost of complianceto the proposed standard constitutes a large fraction of the total costborne by all affected establishments in all industries. Conversely, largerRSE values were selected for those industries which are not expected tocontribute as much to this overall compliance cost. Sample sizes were derived as follows. The actual (i.e., incremental) costincurred by a given establishment as a result of the proposed standardmay be modeled as the product of two independent random variables. Thefirst variable relates to the <T3>total</T3> compliance cost for the establishment. This includes itsbaseline costs (costs it currently experiences as a result of its currenthealth safety policies) plus incremental costs (additional costs stemmingfrom new policies it may have to implement based upon the new standard).This total cost is independent of any establishment policy or practiceand derives solely from the characteristics of each facility (numbers ofemployees, numbers of people treated, etc.). The second variable variesbetween 0 and 1, and measures the establishment's current rate of non-compliancewith the proposed standard. Hence, the cost to each establishment as aresult of the standard may be modeled as, <ITAG tagnum="26">COST<T2>i</T2>+Y<T2>i</T2> andmultiply;P<T2>i</T2>; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">where, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">COST<T2>i</T2>=Incremental Cost to Establishment </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Y<T2>i</T2>=Total Compliance Cost to Establishment </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P<T2>i</T2>=Establishment's Current Percent Non-compliance to New Standard</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and the variance may be expressed as, <ITAG tagnum="26">Var (COST)=(E(Y))\2\ var (P)+(E(P))\2\ var(Y)+var(P)var(Y). </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Having split the total variability in cost into two <T3>independent</T3> components, one stemming from the variability in facilitycharacteristics and the other stemming from variability in policy (i.e.,current compliance), sample requirements may be estimated based upon variousassumptions about the distributions of each. For the total cost variable, Y, a gamma distribution was assumed. For cells4 through 18 the alpha (shape) parameter of the distribution was set toa value equal to 2, resulting in a coefficient of variation (CV) of 70percent. With this value, the distribution is highly skewed and has highvariability. For cells 1 through 3 (Doctors' Offices, Dental Offices, andNursing Homes), OSHA has assumed less variability in the population, usinga value equal to 3 for the shape parameter (slightly skewed with moderatevariability), resulting in a CV of 57 percent. For the non-compliance variable, P, a triangular distribution was assumedwith endpoints at zero and one. The mean of the distribution (expectednon-compliance rate) was determined for each industry based on expert opinionobtained by OSHA. It was assumed here that mean non-compliance would notbe lower than 33 percent and would not be higher than 67 percent. Survey estimators will be self weighting, and will take the form, <ITAG tagnum="26">Y=S(WGT<T2>i</T2> andmultiply; NRAF<T2>1</T2> andmultiply; Response<T2>i</T2>), </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where, WGT is the cell's sampling weight, and NRAF is the cell's non-responseadjustment factor based on a mean imputation. Because the Dunn and Bradstreet universe counts for Physicians' and DentalOffices are approximately 25 to 30 percent lower than similar counts obtainedfrom BLS data, estimates for cells 1 and 2 will be benchmarked to BLS 202employment data. Such estimates will take the form of a ratio estimator:<ITAG tagnum="26">Y=BLS202<T2>EMP</T2> andmultiply; S(WGT<T2>i</T2> andmultiply; NRAF<T2>1</T2> andmultiply; Response<T2>i</T2>)/ S(WGT<T2>i</T2> andmultiply; NRAF<T2>I</T2> andmultiply; E<T2>i</T2>); </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where, BLS202<T2>emp</T2> is the BLS 202 total employment estimate for the industry,and E<T2>i</T2> is establishment employment. The data from the survey will be collected via a Computer Assisted TelephoneInterviewing (CATI) procedure. This methodology allows data to be bothedited and entered into a computer database as the survey information isbeing collected over the telephone. Such a procedure greatly helps to reducenonsampling error by (1) ensuring that the data for each interview areinternally consistent; (2) eliminating the risk of key-punch errors arisingfrom the transcription of hard-copy survey data into machine readable form;and by (3) ensuring that the interviewer follows the correct set of questionnaireskip patterns for each respondent. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Methods to Maximize Response Rates </ITAG>This survey is voluntary and is expected to yield a response rate equalto 75 percent for in scope cases. The CATI collection process will helpto improve the overall response rate by: 1. Allowing the direct telephone contact with the respondent. 2. Scheduling and maintaining a detailed record of all necessary call-backs.Establishments will not be classified as non-responses until five attemptsto make contact have been made. Efforts will be made to distinguish betweenthose units that do not respond because they are out of business and thosethat are ``refusals.'' Non-response adjustment procedures to be used duringestimation are discussed in section B.2. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Testing </ITAG>A pretest of nine sample units will be conducted. The information fromthis procedure will be used to fine-tune the survey instrument. <ITAG tagnum="81">5.
