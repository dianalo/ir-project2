This guidance is a companion piece to earlier guidance on<T3>de minimis</T3> contributor settlements published at 52 FR 24333 (June30, 1987). Also included today are interim models for use in drafting <T3>de minimis</T3> landowner settlements; a model administrative orderon consent, and a model civil judicial consent decree.

The number oflandowners involved will likely be small, and generally will ``involveonly a minor portion of response costs at the facility.'' Nonetheless,the Agency expects to use the authority provided in section 122(g) to providelegal repose for qualifying landowners, while reducing the number of partieswith whom it must carry out the complex and costly CERCLA enforcement process.The Agency is aware of CERCLA's impact on private real estate transactions,notwithstanding the so-called ``innocent landowner'' defense under CERCLA.Despite the clear liability which attaches to landowners who purchase contaiminatedproperty with knowledge of contamination, private transactions concernigsuch property are a fact. Because of concerns about liablity for cleanup,requests for covenants not to sue have been received by the Agency fromprospective purchasers of Superfund sites. It is the Agency's policy notto involve itself in pruely private real estate transactions. However,in very limited circumstances, at sites where enforcement action is ongoingor anticipated, and performance of cleanup, or payment for cleanup, wouldnot otherwise be available, a covenant not to use prospective purchasermight appropriately be considered.

Purpose </ITAG>The purpose of this memorandum is to provide general guidance on landownerliability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,and Liability Act of 1980 (``CERCLA''), as amended by the Superfund Amendmentsand Reauthorization Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-499 (``SARA''), 42 U.S.C.andSection; 9601 <T3>et seq.</T3>, and to provide specific guidance on which landownersqualify for <T3>de minimis </T3> settlements under Section 122(g)(1)(B) and on structuringsuch settlements.\1\<NOTE/> Because the nature of a <T3>de minimis </T3>settlement with a landowner will differ substantiallyfrom a <T3>de minimis </T3>settlement with waste contributors, it will usuallybe more efficient to draft such agreements separately. In addition, becausethe Agency has received numerous requests from prospective purchasers ofcontaminated property for covenants not to sue, this memorandum sets forthAgency policy on this issue. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Agency guidance regarding <T3>de minimis </T3> settlements with waste contributors has been providedby separate memorandum entitled ``Interim Guidance on Settlements with<T3>De Minimis</T3> Waste Contributors under Section 122(g) of SARA,''52 Fed. Reg. 24333 (June 30, 1987), and by publication of the Agency's``Interim Model CERCLA Section 122(g)(4) <T3>De Minimis </T3> Waste Contributor Consent Decree and AdministrativeOrder on Consent,'' 52 FR 43393 (November 12, 1987). <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Overview</ITAG>In the event of a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance,owners of property where such substance has been ``deposited, stored, disposedof, or placed, or otherwise come to be located'' are strictly liable forthe costs of response.\2\<NOTE/> Under section 107(b)(3), such liability generally extendsto releases which are caused by a third party ``in connection with a contractualrelationship, existing directly or indirectly'' with the owner. To addressconcerns that this strict liability could cause inequitable results withrespect to landowners who had not been involved in hazardous substancedisposal activities, Congress in SARA clarified the defense to liabilityavailable to certain landowners under section 107(b)(3) by specificallydefining the term ``contractual relationship.'' Section 101(35)(A) defines``contractual relationship'' to include deeds and other instruments transferringtitle or possession unless the landowner can demostrate that at the timehe acquired the property, he had no knowledge or reason to know of thedisposal of the hazardous substances at the facility. Accordingly, a personwho acquires already contaminated property and who can satisfy the remainingrequirements of section 101(35) as well as those of section 107(b)(3) maybe able to establish a defense to liability. Although this is an affirmativedefense, for which the defendant bears the burden of proof, Congress hasprovided a settlement mechanism which the Agency may use in its discretionfor settlement purposes to resolve the liability of certain landownersprior to or in the early stages of litigation through the application ofthe <T3>de minimis </T3>settlement provisions of section 122(g)(1)(B) of CERCLA.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See </T3>sections 101(9), 101(32), and 107(a)(1) of CERCLA. Liabilityunder CERCLA is also joint and several unless the harm is divisible andthere is a reasonable basis for apportioning the harm. <T3>See, e.g., United States v. Monsanto Co., </T3>858 F.2d 160, 171-73(4th Cir. 1988), <T3>United States v. Bliss, </T3>No. 84-2086C-(1) (E.D. Mo. Sept. 27, 1988),<T3>United States v. Mottolo, </T3>Civ. No. 83-547-D (D. N.H. Aug. 29,1988), <T3>United States v. Tysons, </T3>Civ. No. 84-2663 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 29, 1988),<T3>United States v. Northernaire, </T3>670 F. Supp 742, 748 (W.D. Mich.1987), <T3>United States v. Chem-Dyne Corp., </T3>572 F. Supp. 802 (S.D. Ohio1983).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Background/Landowner Liability</ITAG>A. Before SARASection 107(a)(1) of CERCLA imposes liability for response costs on ownersor operators of ``facilities'' from which there is a release or threatenedrelease of a hazardous substance. A ``facility'' is defined under Section101(9) as including, among other things, any building, structure, equipment,pit, pond, storage container, motor vehicle, etc., and any ``area wherea hazardous substance has been deposited, stored, disposed of, or placed,or otherwise come to be located.'' Courts have consistently held that thestandard of liability imposed by Section 107 is strict. <T3>See, e.g., Tanglewood East Homeowners v. Charles Thomas, Inc., </T3>849F.2d 1568 (5th Cir. 1988), <T3>New York v. Shore Realty Corporation, </T3>759 F.2d 1032, 1042 (2dCir. 1985), <T3>United States v. Hooker Chemicals and Plastics Corp., </T3>680 F. Supp546 (W.D. N.Y. 1988). The government need not prove that the owner contributedto the release in any manner in order to establish a <T3>prima facie </T3>case. However, Section 107(b) provides the followingfour affirmative defenses which may be asserted by a person, includinga landowner: (1) An act of God; (2) an act of war; (3) an act or omissionof a third party; and (4) any combination of the foregoing.\3\<NOTE/> In order to prove the third party defense set forth in Section107(b)(3), the landowner must establish by a preponderance of the evidencethat:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See United States v. Stringfellow, </T3>661 F. Supp. 1053 (C.D. Cal.1987) (holding that these statutory defenses are exclusive). <T3>See also, United States v. Monsanto Co., </T3>858 F. 2d 160, (4th Cir.1988), <T3>United States v. Bliss, </T3>No. 84-2086C-(1) (E.D. Mo. Sept. 27, 1988),<T3>United States v. Hooker Chemicals andamp; Plastics Corp., </T3>680 F.Supp. 546 (W.D. N.Y. 1988), <T3>United States v. Bliss, </T3>667 F. Supp. 1298 (E.D. Mo. 1987), <T3>United States v. Dickerson, </T3>640 F. Supp. 448 (D. Md. 1986).<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) the release or threat of release and * * * damages resulting therefromwere caused solely by * * * an act or omission of a third party other thanan employee or agent of the defendant, or than one whose act or omissionoccurs in connection with a contractual relationship, existing directlyor indirectly with the defendant * * *;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) he exercised due care with respect to the hazardous substanceconcerned, taking into consideration the characteristics of such hazardoussubstance, in light of all relevant facts and circumstances; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) he took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions of anysuch third party and the consequences that could foreseeably result fromsuch acts or omissions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Section 107(b)(3).</ITAG>Before SARA, the Agency took the position that a real estate deed representeda contractual relationship within the meaning of Section 107(b)(3), thuseliminating the availability of the third party defense for a landownerin the chain of title with a party who had caused or contributed to therelease. However, this issue was not addressed by a court before SARA'senactment.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The government's argument on this issue was upheld in<T3>United States v. Hooker Chemicals andamp; Plastics Corp., </T3>680 F.Supp. 546 (W.D. N.Y. 1988) (decided after passage of SARA, applying pre-SARAlaw).<ITAG tagnum="84">B. SARA</ITAG>Section 101(35)(A) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, confirms the Agency'sposition that a real estate deed represents a contractual relationshipand specifically defines ``contractual relationship'' to include ``landcontracts, deeds, or other instruments transferring title or possession,''(for example, leases) unless the property was acquired after the disposalor placement of the hazardous substance which is the subject of the releaseor threat of release and the landowner establishes by a preponderance ofthe evidence that:<ITAG tagnum="21">(i) At the time the defendant acquired the facility the defendantdid not know and had no reason to know that any hazardous substance whichis the subject of the release or threatened release was disposed of on,in, or at the facility;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) The defendant is a government entity which acquired the facilityby escheat, or through any other involuntary transfer or acquisition, orthrough the exercise of eminent domain authority by purchase or condemnation;or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) The defendant acquired the facility by inheritance or bequest.</ITAG>In addition to the foregoing, the landowner must satisfy the due care requirementsof section 107(b)(3) in order to establish the third party defense. Furthermore,section 101(35)(D) provides that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the liability under this Actof a defendant who, by any act or omission, caused or contributed to therelease or threatened release of a hazardous substance.</ITAG>C. SARA's De Minmis Settlement Provisions Under section 122(g)(1) of the CERCLA, as amended by SARA, when the Agencydetermines that a settlement is ``practicable and in the public interest,''it ``shall as promptly as possible reach a final settlement'' if the settlement``involves only a minor portion of the response costs at the facility concerned''and the Agency determines that the potentially responsible party satisfieseither of two sets of conditions: (A) the party's contribution of wasteto the site is minimal (by amount and toxicity) in comparison to otherhazardous substances at the facility; or (B) the party (i) is an ``ownerof the real property on or in which the facility is located;'' \5\<NOTE/> (ii) ``did not conduct or permit the generation, transportation,storage, treatment, or disposal of any hazardous substance at the facility;''\6\<NOTE/> and (ii) ``did not contribute to the release or threat ofrelease * * * through any act or omission.'' Subparagraph B does not applyif the party purchased the property ``with actual or constructive knowledgethat the property was used for the generation, transportation, storage,treatment, or disposal of any hazardous substance.'' Section 122(g)(1)(B).\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Relinquishment of ownership or possession does not necessarilydisqualify a person from consideration under the Section 122(g)(1)(B)<T3> de minimis</T3> settlement provision. This approach is consistentwith the fact that prior owners of facilities are not precluded from attemptingto establish a defense to liability under section 107(b). In order to qualifyfor a<T3> de minimis</T3> settlement, however, the past owner must demonstratesatisfaction of section 122(g)(1)(B) criteria through the full term ofhis ownership.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The Agency interprets the phrase ``any hazardous substance''to mean a hazardous substance which is the subject of the release or threatof release. Interpreting ``any hazardous substance'' more broadly wouldmake the<T3> de minimis</T3> landowner settlement provisions unavailable to essentiallyevery party. It is clear that section 122(g) is concerned with a<T3> de minimis</T3> party's connection to the activities giving rise tothe release that is the subject of the response action. Under section 122(g)(1)(A),the generator or transporter is not a<T3> de minimis</T3> party if it cannot establish that its contributionwas minimal. Similarly, under section 122(g)(1)(B), if the landowner engagedin activities, specified in the statute as ``conduct[ing] or permit[ing]the generation, transportation, storage, treatment, or disposal of anyhazardous substance at the facility,'' involving the substance which isthe subject of the response action, it will not be entitled to<T3> de minimis</T3> status.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ For the reasons explained above, the Agency interpretsthe phrase ``any hazardous substance'' in the context of actual or constructiveknowledge to mean a hazardous substance which is the subject of the releaseor threat of release. The requirement which must be satisfied in order for the Agency to considera settlement which landowners under the<T3> de minimis</T3> settlement provisions of Section 122(g)(1)(B) aresubstantially the same as the elements which must be proved at trial inorder for a landowner to establish a third party defense under Section107(b)(3) and Section 101(35).\8\<NOTE/> Section 122(g)(1)(B) of CERCLA authorizes the Agency to enterinto settlements with<T3> de minimis</T3> landowners, enabling such landowners to avoid thetransaction costs of attempting to establish the 107(b)(3) defense throughlitigation and enabling the Agency to exercise enforcement discretion inappropriate circumstances. However, inasmuch as section 122(g)(1)(B) comesinto play in the settlement context, as distinct from section 107(b)(3)coming into play in the litigation context, the quality and quantum ofevidence provided by a landowner in support of his eligibility for a<T3> de minimis</T3> settlement may differ from that necessary for himto establish the third party defense at trial. Furthermore, inasmuch asthe Agency's determination as to whether the landowner has satisfied thecriteria for a<T3> de minimis</T3> settlement must be made in advance of trial, the termsof the settlement, particularly the question of whether cash considerationwill be required, will depend in part on the extent of the litigation risksinvolved in the particular case. The principles which will guide the Agencyin evaluating this evidence are discussed below in Section IV, ParagraphB.3., ``Settlement.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Even though the language in sections 122(g)(1)(B) and101(35) is not identical, the scope of the two provisions is substantiallythe same. For example, the requirements for a<T3> de minimis</T3> settlement under section 122(g)(1)(B) are that thelandowner ``did not conduct or permit the generation, transportation, storage,treatment, or disposal of any hazardous substance at the facility'' and``did not contribute to the release.'' Substantially similar requirementsare imposed by section 101(35). That Section conditions the defense inpart on the landowner acquiring the facility ``after the disposal or placementof the hazardous substance * * *'' and not contributing to the release.Since generation, transportation, storage and treatment of the substancesat the site generally all take place before disposal and placement (orat the most concurrently, in the case of ``placement'' and ``storage''),the landowner generally would not have conducted or permitted the generation,transportation, storage, treatment, or disposal of the hazardous substanceswhich are the subject of the release or threat of release if he had acquiredthe facility after disposal or placement of those substances, as requiredby section 101(35). This is not to suggest, however, that for purposesof establishing liability under CERCLA, ``disposal'' will not continueto include ongoing ``leaking.'' In this manner, the scope of section 122(g)(1)(B)and 101(35) is generally the same. Throughout this guidance, liabilitywill be discussed in the context of section 107 of CERCLA, but referencewill be made to section 122(g)(1)(B) of CERCLA in the context of settlement.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Statement of Settlement Policy </ITAG>The Agency will make an effort in the early stages of a case to determinewhether a landowner satisfies the elements necessary to establish a thirdparty defense under Section 107(b)(3) of CERCLA. Such determination maybe made from information available to and under development by the Agencyto identify all potentially responsible parties for that site. Since itserves no purpose to require a landowner who satisfies the elements ofsection 107(b)(3) and who wishes to obtain legal repose to incur the litigationcosts of establishing the defense at trial, if the Agency determines thatthe landowner has a persuasive case that each of these elements has beenmet, the Agency will entertain an offer for a<T3> de minimis</T3> settlement under 122(g)(1)(B) of CERCLA. A. Threshold Questions for Landowner Eligibility for Settlement Before the Agency will approve settlements with owners of contaminatedproperty several questions concerning landowner eligibility for settlementsmust be answered, bearing in mind that section 122(g)(1)(B) does not extendto any party who contributed to the release or threat of release ``throughany act or omission.''<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Did the Landowner acquire the property without knowledge or reasonto know of the disposal of hazardous substances?</ITAG>Section 122(g)(1)(B) applies only to owners who purchased the propertywithout ``actual or constructive knowledge that the property was used forthe generation, transportation, storage, treatment, or disposal of anyhazardous substance.'' Similarly, section 101(35) extends the third partydefense to defendants who acquired the property after the disposal or placementof the hazardous substance only if, at the time of acquisition, the defendant``did not know and had no reason to know that any hazardous substance whichis the subject of the release * * * was disposed of * * * at the facility.''\9\<NOTE/> Section 101(35) expressly provides that in order for a defendantto prove that he had ``no reason to know'' of the disposal of hazardoussubstances, he must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that,prior to acquisition, he conducted all appropriate inquiry into the previousownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customarypractice. A landowner who demonstrates that he has conducted ``all appropriateinquiry'' will not be deemed to have constructive knowledge under section122(g)(1)(B) and, therefore, may be eligible for a <T3>de minimis </T3>settlement.\10\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The Agency will construe as similar the constructive knowledgerequirements of Sections 122 and 101(35), taking into consideration allrelevant information available on the issue of knowledge.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ The government has taken the position that ``owner''for the purposes of liability includes ``lessee.'' A lessee of a facility,who is potentially liable as an ``owner,'' may be eligible for a <T3>de minimis </T3>settlement under section 122(g)(1)(B), if he conducted``all appropriate inquiry'' prior to taking possession of the propertyand meets all of the other criteria of section 122(g)(1)(B). This is alsoconsistent with the approach taken in section 101(35). <T3>See </T3>section 101(35)(A) (``The term `contractual relationship'for the purpose of section 107(b)(3) includes, but is not limited to landcontracts, deeds or other instruments''); <T3>See also United States v. S.C.R.D.I., </T3>653 F. Supp. 984, 1003 (D.S.C. 1984) (aff'd <T3>sub nom. United States v. Monsanto Co., </T3>858 F.2d 160 (4th Cir.1988)) (court held lessee an owner); <T3>United States v. Northernaire, </T3>670 F. Supp. 742, 748 (W.D. Mich.1987).Under section 101(35)(B), the following factors must be considered whendetermining whether ``all appropriate inquiry'' has been made:<ITAG tagnum="20">any specialized knowledge or experience on the part of the defendant,the relationship of the purchase price to the value of the property ifuncontaminated, commonly known or reasonably ascertainable informationabout the property, the obviousness of the presence or likely presenceof contamination at the property, and the ability to detect such contaminationby appropriate inspection.</ITAG>These factors clearly indicate that a determination as to what constitutes``all appropriate inquiry'' under all the circumstances is to be made ona case-by-case basis. Generally, when determining whether a landowner hasconducted ``all appropriate inquiry,'' the Agency will require a more comprehensiveinquiry for those involved in commercial transactions than for those involvedin residential transactions for personal use.\11\<NOTE/> For example, an investigation along the lines of a surveyfor contamination may be recommended in some commercial transactions, whereasthis type of inquiry would not typically be recommended for the purchaserof personal residential property.\12\<NOTE/> In sum, the determination will be made on the basis of whatis reasonable under all of the circumstances.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ The Conference Committee noted that a reasonable inquirymust have been made ``in light of best business and land transfer principles'',and that ``[t]hose engaged in commercial transactions should * * * be heldto a higher standard than those who are engaged in private residentialtransactions.'' Conference Report on SARA, H.R. 2005, 99th Cong., 2d Sess.,p. 187. The Committee also noted that the duty to inquire will be judgedas of the time of acquisition, and that as public awareness of environmentalhazards increases, the burden of inquiry will increase concomitantly. <T3>Id. </T3>In a recent decision, the U.S. District Court for the MiddleDistrict of Pennsylvania held that the United States was not entitled tosummary judgment against a group of landowners without an evidentiary showingthat, as of 1969, it was customary or good commercial practice among realestate developers to conduct a visual inspection of property prior to purchase,<T3>United States v. Serafini, </T3>28 Env. Rep. Cas. 1162 (M.D. Pa. Feb.19, 1988). Although we do not agree with the decision because the criteriaset forth in section 101(35)(B) seem, at a minimum, to contemplate a visualinspection, the court in <T3>Serafini </T3>appears to have recognized the evolutionary nature ofthe ``all appropriate inquiry'' standard.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ In the course of conducting ``all appropriate inquiry''as required by section 101(35)(B), information regarding a release or threatof release may become available. If so, the ``person in charge of the facility''is required to comply with the notification requirements under Section103.Lenders may also be eligible for <T3>de minimis </T3>settlements in some circumstances. A lender who doesnot participate in the management of a facility and who only holds ``indiciaof ownership primarily to protect his security interest'' is excepted fromthe definition of ``owner or operator'' and, therefore, is not liable.Section 101(20)(A)(ii). If, however, a lender becomes an owner by foreclosingand taking title to the property or by conducting management activitiesat the site, he is potentially liable.\13\<NOTE/> Under these circumstances, the lender may be eligible fora <T3>de minimis </T3>settlement, if he meets the requirements of Section122, including that he demonstrates that he conducted ``all appropriateinquiry'' prior to acquisition of the facility.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ <T3>See United States v.

Was the property contaminated by third parties outside the chainof title?</ITAG>Even before the enactment of SARA, it was clear that the third party defenseof section 107(b)(3) was available to a landowner whose property was contaminatedas the result of the act or omission of a third party who had no contractualrelationship with the landowner through a deed or otherwise, as long asthe landowner satisfied the other requirements of the third party defense.Examples of this situation include contamination of property by adjacentlandowners and ``midnight dumping.'' A landowner who falls within thiscategory and demonstrates that he has exercised due care may be eligiblefor a <T3>de minimis</T3> settlement under Section 122(g)(1)(B).With respect to landowners described above, the section 107(b)(3) defenseis not available to a landowner who learns of a release or threat of releaseafter acquiring the property and then transfers the property without disclosingthis information. Section 101(35)(C). Any such transfer may contributeto the threat of release under section 122(g)(1)(B)(iii) precluding a <T3>de minimis</T3> settlement.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Guidelines for De Minimis Settlements with Landowners</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Goals of settlement</ITAG>The general goal of a <T3>de minimis</T3> settlement is to allow parties who meet the criteriaset forth in section 122(g)(1)(A) or (B) to resolve their potential liabilityas quickly as possible, thus minimizing litigation costs and allowing thegovernment to focus its resources on negotiations or litigation with themajor parties. However, there is a fundamental difference between contributorsof hazardous substances who are eligible for settlements under SubparagraphA of section 122(g)(1) and landowners who are eligible for settlementsunder Subparagraph B. The waste contributor under Subparagraph A will typicallyhave no viable defense to liability, whereas a landowner who qualifiesfor settlement under Subparagraph B may ultimately be able to prove a thirdparty defense. Nevertheless, the landowner who may have a third party defensemay wish to enter into a <T3>de minimis</T3> settlement in order to obtain legal repose and availhimself of the contribution protection provided in sections 113(f)(2) and122(g)(5) of CERCLA. As discussed below, the government will entertainoffers for such settlements in exchange for, at a minimum, access and duecare assurances.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Information-gathering to aid settlement</ITAG>Section 122(g)(3) of CERCLA provides that <T3>de minimis</T3> settlements shall be concluded as soon as possibleafter the necessary information is available. SARA contemplates that a<T3>de minimis</T3> settlement will be reached in the early stages of acase. The Agency has substantial information-gathing authority under sections104(e) and 122(e) of CERCLA which may be used to aid in the determinationof whether a landowner is eligible for a <T3>de minimis</T3> settlement. Generally, however, the information bearingon a landowner's status as a <T3>de minimis</T3> party is most readily available to the landowner, unlikethe information regarding the waste contributor's status as a <T3>de minimis</T3> party, which is most readily available to the governmentthrough its compilation of information regarding the waste contributionsto a site by all parties. Therefore, the Agency will place on the landownerthe burden of coming forward with information establishing his eligibilityfor a <T3>de minimis</T3> settlement. The Agency may then use its informationgathering authority to supplement the information produced by the landowner,as appropriate, and to check its veracity.Information which should be provided by the landowner includes all evidencerelevant to the actual or constructive knowledge of the landowner at thetime of acquisition including all affirmative steps taken by the landownerto determine the previous ownership and uses of the property, informationregarding the condition of the property at the time of purchase, all documentationand evidence of represenations made at the time of sale regarding prioruses of the property, the purchase price of the property and the fair marketvalue of comparable property at the time of acquisition, and informationregarding any specialized knowledge on the part of the landowner whichmay be relevant.Additionally, the landowner should provide all information relevant tothe issues of whether he exercised due care and whether he contributedto the release or threat of release through any act or omission. This informationshould include the circumstances under which the hazardous substances werediscovered, the extent of the landowner's knowledge regarding the substances,all measures taken by the landowner to abate the threats of harm to humanhealth and the environment posed by such substances, and all measures takenby the landowner to prevent foreseeable acts of third parties which mayhave contributed to the release. The information is to be included in theorder or decree, and any settlement agreement is to be made contingenton its accuracy.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Settlement</ITAG>Where the potentially responsible party meets the criteria for settlementunder Section 122(g)(1)(B), and in the context of litigation or potentiallitigation, when the Agency is evaluating its settlement options and itslitigation risks, the terms of an acceptable settlement may very with thestrength of the evidence relating to the landowner's <T3>de minimis </T3>status. In some instances, a landowner may be ableto make a thoroughly convincing demonstration that each of the elementsof the third party defense has been satisfied. In such cases, settlementsrequiring only that the landowner provide access and due care assuranceswill be appropriate. Although such cases will rarely be free of all doubt,the Government should be persuaded that there is a very high probabilitythat the landowner would prevail in establishing a third party defenseat trial.If a landowner does not make the thorough and convincing demonstrationdescribed above, but is nevertheless able to persuade the Agency that itis likely that he would prevail in establishing the third party defenseat trial, he may be considered for a <T3>de minimis </T3>settlement for cash consideration, as well as accessand due care assurances. A landowner who cannot make this showing is noteligible for a <T3>de minimis </T3>settlement, but may be eligible for a Section 122 settlementusing the same criteria as any other potentially responsible party underCERCLA, the generally applicable guidelines of the Interim CERCLA SettlementPolicy, 50 Fed. Reg. 5034 (February 5, 1985), and the interim guidanceon Covenants Not To Sue Under SARA, 52 Fed. Reg. 28038 (July 27, 1987).In any event, the United States ulitimately must be able to show that any<T3>de minimis </T3>landowner settlement entered into meets the criteriaof Section 122(g)(1)(B) in order to withstand judicial review.a. <T3>Consideration. </T3>All landowners who enter into <T3>de minimis </T3>settlements should be required to provide access tothe property and cooperation in the Agency's response activities. In specificcases, it may be appropriate to obtain cash payments for the response activitiesat the site. Sitge access and cooperation should also extend to the Agency'sresponse action contractors and to any other parties performing responseactivities under the Agency's oversight pursuant to court order, administrativeorder, or consent ageement under section 106 or 122 of CERCLA. The Agencyshould also require the landowner to provide assurances that he will continueto exercise due care with respect to the hazardous substances at the site.\1\\9\<NOTE/> The Agency shall also require that the purchaser file inthe local land records a notice acceptable to EPA, stating that hazardoussubstances were disposed of on the site and that EPA makes no representationas to the appropriate use of the property.\2\\0\<NOTE/> Settlements under CERCLA generally also require that thesettlor agree not to assert any claims or causes of action against theUnited States or the Hazardous Substance Superfund arising from work performedor expenses incurred pursuant to the agreement, or to seek any other casts,damages, or attorney's fees from the United States arising out of responseactivities at the facility.

Policy on Prospective Purchasers</ITAG>Because of the clear liability which attaches to landowners who acquireproperty with knowledge of contamination, the Agency has received numerousrequests for covenants not to sue from prospective purchasers of contaminatedproperty.\27\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ Since settlements with typical prospective purchasers(<T3>i. e.</T3> those who do not currently own the property, are not otherwiseinvolved with the site, and are, therefore, not yet liable under Section107) will not be reached under Section 122, the procedures and restrictionsin that section, such as those relating to covenants not to sue, will notapply.It is the Agency's policy not to become involved in private real estatetransactions. However, a covenant not to sue a prospective purchaser mightappropriately be considered if an enforcement action is anticipated andif performance of or payment for cleanup would not otherwise be availableexcept from the Superland and if the prospective purchaser participatesin a clean-up. A prospective purchaser may participate in cleanup eitherthrough the payment of a substantial sum of money\28\<NOTE/> to be applied towards a clean-up of the site or through acommitment to perform substantial response actions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ Such monies could be paid directly to the Superfund (inthe event the Agency is undertaking the cleanup) or in appropriate circumstancesand with proper controls could be paid to the seller of the property ifthe seller has agreed to perform substantial response action pursuant toan administrative order or consent decree.There are a number of concerns, however, associated with entering intosuch covenants which may, in a given case, outweigh any benefit which theAgency may receive. Given the number of sites on the National PrioritiesList (``NPL''), most have not been the subject of a remedial investigation/feasibilitystudy (``RI/FS''), nor have responsible party searches been conducted.Therefore, in most instances, the extent of contamination and necessaryremedy will be unknown and it may be impossible to determine whether theproposed activities of the prospective purchaser at the site (for example,operating a manufacturing facility or developing the property) will interferewith any remedy ultimately selected by the Agency. Secondly, unless theuniverse of potentially responsible parties and their financial viabilityis known, it will be impossible to determine with any certainty that theAgency is receiving a benefit which otherwise could not be obtained. Ifthere are other viable responsible parties, by entering into an agreementwith a prospective purchaser for future response costs, the Agency willhave merely succeeded in providing those other parties with a set-off againstfuture cost recovery. Furthermore, in some instances, the Agency may ultimatelybe able to recoup its response costs, or at least an amount equivalentto the consideration offered by a prospective purchaser, through enforcementof the federal lien estblished pursuant to Section 107(1) of CERCLA.Moreover, the listing of any site on the NPL means that there is a releaseor threatened release of hazardous substances from the site. Developmentand commercial use of such sites may pose a danger to those persons presentat such sites, and the activities to be carried out by the purchaser, evenwith the exercise of due care, may aggravate or contribute to the contamination.Where the remedy calls for other than destruction of all contaminants belowhealth based levels, there may be a risk that unknown future uses are inconsistentwith the remedy or may interfere with an ongoing cleanup. The Agency recognizes, however, that in an appropriate case, entering intoa convenant not to sue with a prospective purchaser of contaminated property,given appropriate environmental safeguards, may result in an environmentalbenefit through a payment to be applied to clean-up of the site or a commitmentto perform response action. This guidance sets forth criteria which shouldbe met before the Agency will enter into such convenants. These criteriaare minimal standards, however, and the Agency will reject any offer unlessit determines that entering into a convenant with a prospective purchaseris sufficiently in the public interest to warrant expanding the resourcesnecessary to reach such an agreement in light of competing priorities forthe use of limited Agency resources. 1. Criteria for entering into convenants not to sue with prospective purchasersof contaminated property a. <T3>Enforcement action is anticipated by the Agency at the facility.</T3>It is the policy of the Agency not to become involved in purely privatecommercial transactions. The Agency will not entertain requests or covenantsnot to sue from prospective purchasers unless an enforcement action iscontemplated with respect to the facility. Therefore, such convenants generallywill be considered only with regard to those facilities listed or proposedfor listing on the NPL, those facilities at which Fund monies have beenexpended, or those facilities which are the subject of a pending enforcementaction. b. <T3>A substantial benefit, not otherwise available, will be received bythe Agency for cleanup. </T3>The Agency will not entertain requests forcovenants not to sue unless entering into such a covenant will producea substantial monetary benefit to be applied to response activities atthe facility, or an agreement to conduct response actions, which otherwisewould not be available. This criterion may be met if the Agency projectsthat its anticipated response costs are not recoverable from other sources.However, if the Agency determines that its anticipated response costs canbe recouped through other means, such as the filing and enforcement ofa federal lien, such covenants will not be entertained. c. <T3>The Agency believes that the continued operation of the facility ornew site development, with the exercise of due care, will not aggravateor contribute to the existing contamination or interfere with the remedy.</T3>Unless the Agency believes, based on available information, that thecontinued operation of the facility or new development of the site willnot aggravate or contribute to the existing contamination or interferewith the remedy, such agreements will not be entertained. Information whichshould be considered by the Agency includes the remedial investigation/feasibilitystudy, if completed, and all other information relevant to the conditionof the facility. If the prospective purchaser is to continue the operationsof an existing facility, the Agency will require the purchaser to submitinformation sufficient to determine whether the continued operations arelikely to aggravate or contribute to the existing contamination or interferewith the remedy. If the prospective purchaser plans to undertake new operationsor development of the facility, comprehensive information regarding theseplans will be required. If the available information indicates that theplanned activities of the prospective purchaser are likely to aggravateor contribute to the existing contamination, the agreement will not beentered into or will include restrictions which prohibit those operationsor portions of those operations which are likely to aggrevate or contributeto the existing contamination or interfere with the remedy. The Agency's determination as to whether the available information is sufficientfor purposes of this evaluation will be made on a case by case basis; however,one key factor which will necessarily be considered is whether the remedialinvestigation has been completed and the extent of information which hasbeen generated in that process. If the available information is insufficientfor purposes of evaluating the impact of the proposed activities, the agreementwill not be entered into.  d. <T3>Due consideration has been given to the effect of continued operationsor new development on health risks to those persons likely to be presentat the site. </T3>The Agency will not entertain requests for covenantsnot to sue unless due consideration has been given to the effect whichcontinued operations at the facility or new development is likely to haveon the health risks to those persons likely to be present at the site.e. <T3>The prospective purchaser is financially viable. </T3>The prospectivepurchaser must demonstrate that he is financially viable and capable offulfilling his obligations under the agreement. The Agency will not entertainrequests for covenants not to sue if it appears that the Agency could notrecoup its costs in the event that the purchaser breaches his obligationsunder the agreement. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Content and form of settlement</ITAG>If the foregoing criteria are met, and the Agency determines that enteringinto the covenant not to sue is in the public interest, the covenant willbe embodied in an agreement to be executed by the authorized representativeof the prospective purchaser, the Regional Administrator (with the concurrenceof the AA-OECM, the AA-OSWER, and the Attorney General), and, where appropriate,the current owner of the facility.\2\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\9\ In the past, this has arisen most often in the bankruptcycontext. a. <T3>Consideration. </T3>Generally, the consideration required of the prospectivepurchaser will be a cash payment. In specific cases, it may be possibleto dedicate the payments to response activities at the site through anappropriate mechanism.\3\\0\<NOTE/> However, the consideration may take the form of a removal,or if a Record of Decision (ROD) has been signed, remedial activities.In addition, the prospective purchaser must agree not to assert any claimsor causes of action against the United States or the Hazardous SubstanceSuperfund arising from contamination of the facility which exists as ofthe date of acquisition of the facility, or to seek any other costs, damages,or attorney's fees from the United States arising out of response activitiesat the facility.\3\\1\<NOTE/> The Agency shall also require that the purchaser file inthe local land records a notice acceptable to EPA, stating that hazardoussubstances were disposed of on the site and that EPA makes no representationas to the appropriate use of the property. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\0\ Note, however, that at present, the federal Superfundaccounting system does not provide for the establishment of site-specificaccounts to receive dedicated payments.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\1\ In evaluating what is appropriate consideration, theAgency should consider the value of any lien which may be or has been placedon the property pursuant to CERCLA section 107(1), since, in entering intoan agreement with a prospective purchaser, the government is relinquishingits right to recover its cleanup costs when the property is subsequentlysold to the prospective purchaser. This is because an agreement with aprospective purchaser would effectively constitute a satisfaction of theprospective purchaser's liability for cleanup work at the site, thus terminatingany lien under section 107(1)(E).The agreement should contain a provision under which the purchaser grantsan irrevocable right of entry to the Agency, its response action contractors,and other persons performing response actions under Agency oversight forthe purpose of taking response actions at the facility and for monitoringcompliance with the agreement. In exchange for this consideration, the Agency will grant a covenant notto sue to the prospective purchaser for civil liability under Sections106 and 107(a) of CERCLA and Section 7003 of RCRA arising from contaminationof the facility which exists as of the date of acquisition of the facility.The covenant should provide that, with respect to any claim or cause ofaction asserted by the Agency against the prospective purchaser, the purchasershall bear the burden of proving that the claim or cause of action, orany part thereof, is attributable solely to contamination which existedprior to the date of acquisition. b. <T3>Reservation of rights. </T3>The agreement should expressly reservethe Agency's rights to assert all claims against the prospective purchaser,except for those set forth in the covenant not to sue, including, but notlimited to, those claims arising from: (i) the release or threat of release of any hazardous substance, pollutantor contaminant resulting from the purchaser's operation of the facility;(ii) the release or threat of release of any hazardous substance, pollutant,or contaminant resulting from the introduction of any hazardous substance,pollutant, or contaminant at the facility by any person after the dateof acquisition by the purchaser; (iii) exacerbation of contamination existing prior to the date of acquisition;(iv) failure to cooperate and/or interference with the Agency, its responseaction contractors, or other persons conducting response activities underAgency oversight in the implementation of response actions at the facility;(v) failure to exercise due care with respect to any contamination at thefacility; or (vi) any and all criminal liability. The agreement should also expressly reserve the Agency's rights to assertall claims and causes of action against all persons other than the purchaser.Unless the Federal natural resource trustee has agreed in writing to thecovenant not to sue, the agreement should also expressly reserve naturalresource damage claims. c. <T3>Scope of response actions. </T3>The agreement should provide that noneof its terms is to be construed as limiting or restricting the nature orscope of response actions which may be undertaken by the Agency in exercisingits authority under federal law. In most circumstances, the agreement shouldalso state that the purchaser recognizes that the implementation of responseactions may interfere with its operation, including closure of the facilityor a part thereof. d. <T3>Compliance with applicable laws and duty to exercise due care. </T3>Theagreement should provide that the purchaser is subject to the requirementsof all federal and state laws and regulations, including the duty to exercisedue care with respect to hazardous substances at the facility. e. <T3>Disclaimer. </T3>The agreement should contain a statement that theexecution of the agreement in no way constitutes an Agency finding as tothe risks to human health and the environment which may be posed by contaminationat the facility or an Agency representation that the property is fit forany particular use. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Procedures</ITAG>Any agreement entered with a prospective purchaser of contaminated propertymust receive the concurrence of the AA-OECM and the AA-OSWER. Additionally,such agreement must be approved by the Attorney General.
