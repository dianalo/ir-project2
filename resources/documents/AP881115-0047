(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The 102 anti-abortion activistsarrested for trying to block the doors of a women's clinic may endup paying the Police Department for costs incurred in handling theprotest, the police chief said.   Police Chief Joe Gerwens said Monday he had asked City ProsecutorScott Walker to try to recover the estimated $3,800 the Nov. 4protest cost the department.   ``They chose civil disobedience to make a point and they shouldbe willing to pay the consequences,'' Gerwens said. ``They plannedon being arrested.''   Demonstrators planted themselves before the entrance to the SigmaWomen's Center, which advertises abortions, waiting to carried topaddy wagons and booked on trespassing charges.   It took 26 Fort Lauderdale police officers, plus eight fromnearby Oakland Park and the Broward County Sheriff's Office, toquell the disturbance, Gerwens said.   In addition to the officers' time, police cars had to be divertedfrom their assigned zones to handle the protest. Other costsincluded transportation, two portable toilets, film for bookingprisoners, an emergency medical truck and an ambulance, he said.   Bonnie Callahan, a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion organizationRescue South Florida, which was among several groups at the protest,called the plan to seek reimbursement unfair.   Ms. Callahan, whose 13-year-old daughter was among thosearrested, said the demonstration ``was not for the purpose ofgetting arrested or getting publicity. Our main reason was to savebabies and save women from being exploited.''   All those arrested were charged with trespassing, and all but onewere immediately released and given notice to appear in court.   Gerwens said that by seeking reimbursement, the city was nottaking a position on the protest, only that taxpayers should nothave to pay for a deliberate disturbance. He said the departmentwill further pursue the idea of making those convicted of a crimepay the police costs involved.</TEXT></DOC>
