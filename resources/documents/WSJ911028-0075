The comptroller's office last month confirmed that theSecurities and Exchange Commission has undertaken such aninvestigation and said that it had suspended an employeepending the outcome of the inquiry. On Friday, the officesaid the SEC investigation now covers two midlevel employeesand a former official who left the agency in 1989.</LP><TEXT>   The former official is Stephen Lane, who at the time heleft the comptroller's office headed a project to establishprocedures for examining bank loans used to finance leveragedbuy-outs and other highly leveraged transactions. Afterleaving the government, he became a senior vice president ofSecura Group, a Washington bank consulting firm.   Mr. Lane resigned from Secura as news was breaking aboutthe SEC's investigation into the possible misuse of insiderinformation about the large bank merger.   &quot;We were informed during the last week of September thatone of our employees, Steve Lane, had purchased a relativelymodest dollar amount of options on the stock of SecurityPacific and Bank of America within the two-week period priorto the announcement of the merger between those twocompanies,&quot; said William Isaac, chairman of Secura. &quot;Heinformed us that the SEC was looking into whether there wastrading on inside information with respect to the merger. Webelieve that Steve didn't have access to inside informationthrough our firm because, to our best knowledge, the firmwasn't aware of the merger prior to its announcement,&quot; Mr.Isaac said.   Mr. Isaac issued the statement in response to a questionfrom the American Banker, which first reported that Mr. Laneis a target of the SEC investigation. Mr. Lane &quot;denies thathe had any access to any inside information, and we have noreason to doubt his denial,&quot; Mr. Isaac said. He added thatMr. Lane &quot;tendered his resignation on or about Oct. 1, and itwas accepted.&quot; Mr. Lane couldn't be reached for comment.   In response to a question, OCC spokeswoman Leonora Crossconfirmed that the SEC is looking at a possible link betweenMr. Lane and the employee that the agency suspended lastmonth. She also disclosed that the agency has suspended asecond official who is under SEC investigation. SECenforcement chief William McLucas refused to comment on theinvestigation, and Ms. Cross wouldn't supply additionaldetails.   She did say, however, that the SEC inquiry has promptedthe comptroller's office to review the security of itselectronic information-processing system and its ethicsrules. Current rules bar bank examiners and policy-makingofficials from owning bank securities; this prohibition maybe extended to all agency employees, she said. Thecomptroller regulates about 3,900 national banks.   The officials under suspicion aren't bank examiners orpolicy makers. Both were placed on administrative leave withpay and blocked from access to all of the comptroller'sinformation systems pending completion of the SECinvestigation.</TEXT></DOC>
