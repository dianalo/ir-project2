Consequently, there is a great needfor monitoring the PAH concentration of a variety of media, includingwater and industrial wastewater. Recently, the United States EnvironmentalProtection Agency (U.S. EPA) developed a sensitive analytical method,designated Test Method 610, for the determination of priority pollutantPAHs in aqueous industrial discharges. This method employs reversed phasehigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet (UV) andfluorescence detection to determine all sixteen priority pollutant PAHsin a single chromatographic separation.</TEXT></DOC>
