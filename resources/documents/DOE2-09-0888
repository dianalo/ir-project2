Volume 2 provides theinformation on the structure of the computer code and how it is usedin the health-effects assessments. The two volumes present enough detailso that interested persons may apply the model, using appropriate andapplicable input data, for assessing the cumulative population healtheffects from a LLW disposal site.</TEXT></DOC>
