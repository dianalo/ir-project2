 The company, which is based in East Horsley,Surrey aims to offer computer expertise to businesses in the South East.andO;Correction, the company aims to offer computer know-how to businesses in theSouth East.andP;  The distinction is key to understanding the philosophy behindcompanies such as Deagro, which are not hung up on professional parlance orformal approaches, but which are nevertheless based on astute businessacumen.andP;  Grossmith had his first taste of computing at Guildford TechnicalCollege where, while doing a business studies course, he learnt some Basic onmainframe.andP;  After working for a small, London-based unit trust company for ashort time, Grossmith entered employment at the banking and investment houseSchroders.andP;  He began, as most Schroders recruits do, in administration.andP;  Hisparticular department was pension fund management, and he quickly becameinvolved in the development of the company's computerisation planning.andM;Self-financedandM;His interest in this field was sparked off by the design ofandM;spreadsheets and the potential use of big databases.andP;  His fascination withcomputer development was given time to grow at Schroder's research departmentwithin investment management, where, in his own time, he carried out researchinto the problems of small businesses.andP;  He came to the conclusion that manybusinesses had bought computers on the back of white heat hype, and did notreally understand their full potential and what they 1could add to abusiness.andP;  Many such businesses require a lot of very simple advice on how todevise a spreadsheet, get their hardware, software and printer workingtogether and so on.andP;  With this research under his belt, Grossmith leftSchroders to set up his own company, Deagro, in an effort to fill thisknow-how and support gap.andP;  The venture is completely self-financed and, atfirst, is catering for businesses with 15 or more employees who belong to theage group that missed out on a computer education but who have picked up aknowledge of word processing and spreadsheets, and now need help and supportto get more benefits out of the computers too often sitting idle in theoffice.andP;  Consequently, Grossmith is currently to be found at business clubsin the Surrey and Thames Valley area &quot;stimulating latent demand&quot;.andP;  Hisservice includes defining computer requirements, proposing the necessarysystems, advising on hardware and software, designing specialist software,training users, helping with day-to-day issues and planning futuredevelopments.andM;By Katy RingandM;The second Deagro strategy involves packaging software for nicheandM;7markets.andP;  To this end Grossmith has already developed a program fornewsagents called Quick News which retails for #1,700, thereby considerablyundercutting rival packages such as that offered by Computer 100 which costsover #3,000.andP;  The package requires an IBM micro with hard disk and printer,and its low price stems from the fact that it is menu-driven with easy-to-understand windows so that users don't need so much training to handle theprogram.andP;  Grossmith feels that price is important in such a price sensitivemarket, and that the computer industry's penetration of newsagents isessentially a marketing problem.andP;  It follows that he is hoping to combat thisproblem by recruiting a sales team from trades like Do It Yourself where thesocial and educational level is comparable to that of the people he wants tosell his packages to.andP;  Although it is something of an understatement to saythat the newsagent business is not highly computerised at the moment, this,according to Grossmith, is about to change as the big retailers move in onnewsagencies with the intention of streamlining their operations.andP;  Otherniche markets on the Deagro horizon are accounting packages for generalpractitioners on the one hand, and the Do It Yourself trade on the other.andO;Apparently, DIY retailers outside the majors are not well served bycomputerisation at the moment, something which is again likely to change inthe near future.andP;  Last but by no means least in Grossmith's eyes, Deagro willoffer consultancy services to financial institutions.andP;  This arm of thebusiness will draw on its chairman's experience within investment banking atSchroders where he helped to develop a support database system to analyseinformation which aids fund management decision making.andP;  Deagro believes thatthe future of database products within large 3financial institutions lieswith Structured Query Language, SQL.andP;  For since it has fewer than 30commands, it is quick to learn and implement, and has the advantage that itis enjoying something of a renaissance in the micro environment.andP;  As soon asit is fully implemented at the desktop level it will offer hardware savingsby enabling an SQL server to draw data down from dBase IV and will thusbecome a feasible management tool.andM;PolitickingandM;While Grossmith evidently owes a lot of his knowledge and insightandM;to his career experiences at Schroders, one aspect of working within a largeCity company that he is happy to leave behind is what members of the TudorCourt termed &quot;politicking&quot;.andP;  A not unbecoming glint of idealism enters hiseyes as he talks enthusiastically about the Computer Management Group's&quot;open&quot; management strategy, saying that, &quot;everyone should know everythingwithin a company as well as have a financial share in the company'sfortunes&quot;.andP;  And that is clearly the philosophy behind Deagro.andP;  As regards hisposition in a trend of young businessmen within the computer industryGrossmith acknowledges that the difference between the new generation ofentrepreneurs and their predecessors is that they have taught themselves fromtheir position as end-users and worked backwards, and have communication andmanagement skills that other generations of programmers have sadly lacked.andO;Therefore, not only do people like Grossmith know that MS-DOS and the 80286have a lot of life left in them and offer the best solutions for their typeof client, they can personally explain why.andP;  All in all, Dean Grossmith looksto have a long future ahead of him, especially if one takes intoconsideration the fact that he is presently only 23 years old.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
