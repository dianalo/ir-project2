The possibility was raised in a cover letter to a classified listof proposed foreign arms sales submitted to the Senate ForeignRelations Committee last month.   The annual list details possible U.S. arms sales. For eachlarge-scale sale, Capitol Hill must be notified and Congress thenhas 60 days to block the deal.   The letter left open the possibility the administration willnotify Congress during the coming year of its intent to sell SaudiArabia the F-18s, but the letter doesn't commit the United States tosuch a sale.   The list was compiled by the Reagan White House and could bechanged by the new administration.   The list includes the sale to Saudi Arabia of M1-A tanks andmultiple rocket launchers. Most of those items are not expected tobe controversial, said the sources, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   Saudi Arabia has told the United States it is still shoppingaround Europe for alternatives to the F-18, such as the FrenchMirage 2000 or a fighter jet produced by a joint British-Frenchventure, the sources said.   The Saudi decision may only come next year, once all the Europeanmodels are available, they said. The Saudis are not in a rush tomake the decision because the new jets are designed as replacementfor its current U.S. fleet of F-5s and F-15s, which is good at leastuntil 1995.   While the Europeans are offering the Saudis better financialterms than the United States, the Saudis are still attracted by thequality of U.S. aircraft, which have been the mainstay of theirarsenal, and the pilot training program offered by the UnitedStates, the sources said.   The Saudis are also seeking to avoid an embarrassing fight withCongress over such a sale, which many on Capitol Hill oppose.   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., last month put the administrationon notice he would try to block an F-18 sale on the grounds itendangers Israel. The two nations are technically still in a stateof war.   The Reagan and Bush administrations have both argued thatpersistent congressional rejections of such aircraft sales havedriven the Saudis to look elsewhere, at the expense of U.S.businesses and foreign policy interests.</TEXT></DOC>
