For the past two years, acting as the president's designated biographer, Mr. Morris has enjoyed unprecedented access to ordinarily forbidden sanctums of the White House. In a novel arrangement, the president has reportedly granted him at least one &quot;substantial&quot; interview each month, as well as access to cabinet and other high-level meetings.    The arrangement has been lauded by scholars as a rare opportunity for a first-rate historian to capture history while it's fresh. But now, in a twist of the Iran-Contra affair that is stirring debate in both legal and academic circles, Congress is considering subpoenaing both Mr. Morris and his notes in an attempt to find more about President Reagan's part in the affair. The prospect threatens to turn a scholarly coup into a legal swamp, outraging the academic and publishing communities in the process.    Harvard political scientist Nelson Polsby asserts, &quot;This kind of thing would kill any future efforts to do anything like this -- no one will ever trust or want to work with such a person again.&quot; He insists that &quot;Morris's position has to be 'No' to everybody. Otherwise he'll compromise his position totally.&quot;    Mr. Morris, a slight, bookish-looking, 47-year-old native of Kenya, whose much-acclaimed 1980 Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Theodore Roosevelt displayed a rich understanding of both history and character, prefers not to talk to the press about his situation.    Described by acquaintances as a serious scholar with a wonderful wit, he has studiously kept a low profile since Random House signed what an official there says was a $3 million contract for the Reagan biography in late 1985. (White House authorities say Mr. Morris also has an agreement with Mr. Reagan, promising not to publish any of his research until at least two years after the president leaves office, but otherwise imposing no restraints).    For the most part, Mr. Morris has been an unobtrusive White House presence, scribbling notes in tiny, cramped handwriting, and at least once, at the U.S.-Soviet summit in Geneva, according to the president's son Ron, pressing his ear to the door as the two world leaders met.    To date, none of the congressional committees investigating the president's part in the Iran-Contra affair has called Mr. Morris to testify. But the idea is being actively researched by the Senate's select committee on the scandal. Frustrated by a number of witnesses who said they had kept no notes of important White House meetings, and stymied by contradictory testimony they had been unable to clarify, the investigators recently began to consider subpoenaing both the president's private diaries (he has promised &quot;relevant portions&quot;) and Mr. Morris's notes.    One committee member, Sen. William Cohen (R., Maine), confirms that the staff is &quot;exploring&quot; the possibility of calling Mr. Morris. &quot;I'm sure it's relevant,&quot; he says of Mr. Morris's possible testimony, &quot;the question is whether it's appropriate.&quot; Another committee member, Sen. Howell Heflin (D., Ala.), suggests Mr. Morris &quot;may be able to refresh the president's recollection in a way no one else could.&quot;    But legal scholars suggest such a subpoena would stir a nest of complicated legal problems. Floyd Abrams, a New York attorney who specializes in First Amendment law, says, &quot;It's an area that's plagued with uncertainty.&quot; He suggests that should Mr. Morris decline to testify, he would likely get the same sort of protection against divulging confidential information that journalists might receive. Basically, the courts would have to weigh the value of his research project against the value of any light he might shed on the congressional investigation.    &quot;He could make a serious claim to serving First Amendment purposes of the highest order,&quot; says Mr. Abrams, &quot;by preparing a book that will reveal heretofore unknown and unknowable information of the highest order of interest to the American public.&quot; He notes that Mr. Morris could cite no executive-privilege arguments, since he's not a member of the executive branch. And interestingly, none of the material the president has shared with Mr. Morris, which reportedly includes the first few years of his own White House diaries, can be covered by executive privilege now that this material has been shown to someone outside of the executive branch, Mr. Abrams says.    In the past, Congress has backed down in such situations. When TV newsman Daniel Schorr refused in 1976 to disclose to an investigating committee how he obtained a copy of the Pike Report on the Central Intelligence Agency, he was never held in contempt. And when CBS News executive Frank Stanton refused to supply outtakes from the controversial 1971 TV documentary, &quot;The Selling of the Pentagon,&quot; Congress backed off rather than pursue the issue.    While Mr. Morris might be able to turn away a congressional subpoena, legal experts say he'll be on far shakier ground if he's called either by the special prosecutor conducting the criminal investigation into the matter, or by any of the defense attorneys involved in potential charges. The Supreme Court has established, in a case called Brandsburg vs. Hayes, that every citizen has a responsibility to testify if he has witnessed a crime.    Academics and publishers, however, worry that if Mr. Morris were compelled to divulge his research prematurely, it would forever chill projects from which, as historian Henry Steele Commager puts it, &quot;the public can profit from inestimably.&quot; Mr. Morris's editor at Random House, Bob Loomis, says that, &quot;We're naturally very anxious and very disturbed by such things. Congress has to realize that this kind of thing could be really detrimental to free access to information and freedom to publish. Any threat would be horrendous.&quot;    But Mr. Morris, whose wry manner seems to have made him a popular White House confidant, is apparently unshaken by the brewing turmoil around him. A student of the long haul, he has a fairly unflappable view of the daily vicissitudes. He is said to have told at least one White House official that he hopes lawmakers do call on him to testify. His research, he has joked, would simply &quot;put them to sleep.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
