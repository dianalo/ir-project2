(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The first major American exhibition ofcontemporary East German art is most surprising for what it does notinclude _ ``no grand pictures of tractors and happy peasants,''according to a Harvard curator.   Instead, the dozen artists whose work was chosen to represent theGerman Democratic Republic dispel stereotypes of flat socialist artwith often harrowing portraits of the horrors of war and politicaloppression.   The nearly 70 paintings and drawings by artists, ages 35 to themid-80s, were selected by Harvard curator Peter Nisbet, art criticDore Ashton of the Cooper Union in New York and modern German arthistorian and Professor Peter Selz.   ``We hope the whole show undermines expectations,'' said Nisbet,who accompanied the others on travels to East Germany to meetartists and their work. ``This is an example of how many of theseartists do not show false optimism or a sense that there is an easyroad to an ideal state. They are aware of the fraigility of peace,of nightmares, of anxiety.''   The artists whose paintings are shown are not among the legionsof refugees departing the country across the Hungarian border toAustria, he said.   ``These are people who have decided to stay and fight andintroduce into East Germany's official culture as much of human lifeas they can,'' said Nisbet, who led a tour of the exhibit Friday,which opens Sept. 16 and runs through Nov. 5. ``One has toacknowledge the honorable role they play. The people who are leavingdecided to give up the struggle.''   The paintings range from Max Uhlig's expressionist, almostabstract portraits and landscapes to Theodor Rosenhauer's stilllifes and other, more light-hearted and ironic works.   The exhibit, half of which is in the Fogg Museum at HarvardUniversity and the other half at the Sackler Museum across thestreet, opens with a twist.   The first work on view is a four-panel painting that depicts fourSoviet soldiers against a vivid red background.   ``It's the perfect introductory painting,'' said Nisbet. ``Itlooks propaganda-like.''   But on closer inspection, the soldiers in Thomas Ziegler's``Soviet Soldier 1987'' are clearly from different ethnic groups.One art critic, said Nisbet, suggested the paintings are ameditation on ``individual versus the group'' and hint at thetransience of military occupation and the hope for eventual peace.   The paintings and drawings that follow ``Soviet Soldier'' smashstereotypes of ``socialist realism'' painting.   Bernhard Heisig's haunting ``Volunteer Soldier'' is among themost powerful in the exhibit. It depicts the horrified face of asoldier, surrounded by a dark, swirling montage of images thatNisbet termed a ``collage of horrible memories.''   Many of the artists' works invoke feelings of helplessness andanxiety. Nisbet suggested that the artists have struggled with thestunted political and cultural history of East Germany. While theydraw on the rich history of German art, they cannot escape theconstraints and sense of collective identity confusion in an Easternbloc country.   Walter Libuda's ``Ceiling Runner'' is Kafkaesque in its portrayalof a man hanging upside down with his feet on the ceiling.   But not all the paintings are as dark.   One of Sighard Gille's works, ``Party in Leipzig,'' shows a groupof artists engaged in a bit of decadence at a cafe. The painting wasconsidered controversial in East Germany but was eventually allowedto be shown there and abroad, said Selz, who teaches at theUniversity of California at Berkeley.   ``It shows there's much more freedom of artistic expression,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
