Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate inthe making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the onecomment received in response to the proposal. The commenter supported the rule. After careful review of the available data, including the comments notedabove, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest requirethe adoption of the rule as proposed. It is estimated that 103 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected bythis AD, that it will take approximately 6 manhours per airplane to accomplishthe required actions, and that the average labor cost will be $40 per manhour.Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operatorsis estimated to be $24,720. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is nota ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positiveor negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteriaof the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been preparedfor this action and is contained in the regulatory docket. A copy of itmay be obtained from the Rules Docket. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 </ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. <ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends Part 39 of the Federal AviationRegulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]  </ITAG>1.
