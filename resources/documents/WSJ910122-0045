Since the Gulf war erupted last week, trading volume hasexploded in various after-hours markets for stocks, bonds,commodities or currencies. &quot;A lot of people here who boughtstock in Europe overnight Wednesday clearly did very well,&quot;said Bernard Madoff, chairman of Bernard L. Madoff InvestmentSecurities, an off-exchange broker. These investors boughtjust before Thursday's huge rallies that drove stock pricessharply higher around the globe.</LP><TEXT>   Craig Drill, a New York money manager, said he bought5,000 shares of Merck andamp; Co. and 5,000 shares of InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. on Wednesday night. His profit:$26,150.   However, most overnight trading is dominated by largeinternational brokerage firms and institutional investors.And most brokerage firms discourage individuals from tryingto trade after exchange hours. Overnight markets can betreacherous, too.   After-hours markets &quot;typically are very thin, and thepeople you're up against are professionals who probably willhave a great deal more information and agility than theaverage individual investor,&quot; warned Marshall B. Front,executive vice president of Stein Roe andamp; Farnham Inc., whichmanages more than $20 billion. &quot;I definitely would notencourage trading after hours for individuals as a way ofspeculating on late-breaking events.&quot;   Still, for those insomniacs who want to trade around theclock, here is a guide to several of the major overnightmarkets:                                                                                                          THIRD MARKET FOR STOCKS: Many institutional investorsbought and sold stocks after hours last week through theso-called third market. That refers to securities firms thatmake markets in New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks off thefloor of an exchange. This trading can take place eitherduring regular hours or after hours.   Jefferies andamp; Co., Los Angeles, and Madoff InvestmentSecurities, New York, are the two main U.S. firms that makeactive markets off the exchange during and after U.S. tradinghours. Both firms deal with big institutions and brokeragefirms. Most investors using Jefferies typically seek to swaplarge blocks of stock with other big investors; this trade iscalled a cross. They do the trade away from the Big Board forease and anonymity.   Madoff often trades directly with brokerage firms, usingits own money to complete trades.   Executives from both firms say their trading desks areready for active off-hours markets, but, except for Wednesdayand Thursday of last week, business has been just a bit moreactive than normal.                                                                                                          BROKERAGE FIRMS: Most large U.S. stockbrokers are preparedto deal with major U.S. institutional clients around theclock, either through U.S. offices or their offices overseas.Last week, for example, First Boston Corp. and Goldman, Sachsandamp; Co. traded millions of shares from Wednesday's close toThursday's opening of U.S. markets. Early yesterday morning,First Boston traded around 150,000 shares.   New York Stock Exchange rules generally prohibit memberfirms from crossing for customers or trading Big Board stocksfor their own accounts after hours, except in non-U.S.markets. But firms can trade on behalf of customers withother member firms anytime.   Most firms operate between New York and whatever foreignmarket is open, such as Tokyo or London. If a U.S. clientwants to put in an order to buy IBM, he could call aU.S.-based salesman or trader or call the firm's officeoverseas.   First Boston says the firm has traders and salesmen &quot;oncall&quot; if clients need to trade. &quot;It is a somewhat limiteduniverse of clients who are willing to trade after hours,more like 30 or 40 institutions,&quot; said Mark Loehr, managingdirector in charge of First Boston's equity desk.   But most individuals will have a tough time trying to finda U.S. broker willing to trade with them after hours. Thesefirms say there usually isn't enough business to justify it.But big-ticket individual investors should be able to callsome brokers and trade overnight. However, a Merrill Lynch andamp;Co. spokesman says &quot;it is possible&quot; for individual investorsto trade at night if they make arrangements ahead of timewith their Merrill broker.                                                                                                          INSTINET: Traders also use Instinet, a real-timeelectronic stock trading service owned by Reuters HoldingsPLC. It's a computer screen with a keyboard enablingsubscribers to enter, negotiate and execute ordersanonymously.   &quot;This is just for professional equity traders,&quot; says WendyPatrick, manager of product support services. &quot;The system wasdesigned for professionals, and we do not anticipate everhaving individuals use it.&quot;   Trading volume on Instinet was exceptionally busy in theearly hours last week. More than a million shares were tradedon Instinet from 6 p.m. EST Thursday to 9:30 a.m. EST Friday.                                                                                                          OVERSEAS EXCHANGES: Many U.S. stocks are listed onoverseas exchanges that are open when American exchanges haveclosed. For example, shares of IBM can be bought and sold onstock exchanges in Austria, Belgium, Canada, England, France,Germany, Japan, Switzerland and the Netherlands.   Tokyo trading starts at 7 p.m. EST, and goes until 9 p.m.Then comes a second session beginning at 11 p.m. and lastinguntil 1 a.m. Shares of more than 70 U.S. companies are listedthere.   To trade overseas, you first need to open an account witha brokerage firm that has access to overseas markets.Generally, only wealthy individuals would be consideredeligible for overseas trading.                                                                                                          CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE has an evening session allowinginvestors of all sizes to buy and sell U.S. Treasury note andbond futures and options contracts, as well as various othertypes of contracts. Trading starts at 6 p.m. EST and runsuntil 9:30 p.m., EST, Sunday through Thursday.   Wednesday was the second busiest session since eveningtrading began April 30, 1987, with total volume of 121,695contracts, an exchange spokesman says.   Most night trading is done by institutions. Individualinvestor trading of interest-rate futures &quot;is relativelysmall,&quot; a CBOT spokesman says.   By far the most actively traded issue is the Treasury bondfutures contract, which has a $100,000 face value. To buy acontract, investors first must set up an account with aregistered broker. The minimum, or current initial margin,for one 30-year Treasury bond futures contract is $4,050 forspeculative trades, but only $3,000 if used as a hedgeagainst an existing portfolio. However, brokers typicallyrequire customers to put up considerably more than that toplay.                                                                                                          PHILADELPHIA STOCK EXCHANGE: Major banks trade currenciesaround the clock in several financial centers, likeSingapore, Hong Kong and Frankfurt. In the U.S., a fairlyactive after-hours market in currency options can be found atthe Philadelphia Stock Exchange.   The exchange trades five currency options contracts --yen, mark, British pound, Swiss franc, and Australian dollar-- from 6 p.m. EST to 3:30 a.m. the following morning. At3:30 a.m., the exchange brings on three more currency optionscontracts -- French franc, European currency units andCanadian dollar -- which trade until 2:30 p.m. in theafternoon. Individuals can trade here through a broker.   TWENTY-FOUR-HOUR PHONE LINES: To cash in on the insomniacmarket, a few securities firms have set up special phonelines that individual investors can call 24 hours a day.Discount brokers Charles Schwab andamp; Co. and FidelityInvestments, for example, both offer this service.   A recent Schwab advertisement shows an investor in pajamasand bathrobe, with a glass of milk and a plate of cake by hisside, poring over stock listings and calling his broker. &quot;Imake some of my biggest decisions in the smallest hours. Thencall Schwab,&quot; says the ad. In boldface type, the ad alsosays: &quot;I can place trades with Schwab, even at 2 in themorning.&quot;   But don't expect your orders for U.S. stocks to beexecuted at 2 in the morning. Both Schwab (as the ad pointsout) and Fidelity don't execute orders for any U.S. stocksfor individuals until the U.S. markets open in the morning.   Schwab officials say their overnight trading volume is up10% since the Iraq war began. Activity also perked up atFidelity. On Wednesday night, &quot;we had about twice as manyorders as usual sitting in what we call our warehouse file,waiting to be executed at the open&quot; of trading Thursdaymorning, said Susanne Mahoney, vice president at FidelityBrokerage.   Given the risks and the difficulty, should individualinvestors try to trade overnight? They might be much betteroff putting the phone back on the hook and getting somesleep, say many securities executives.   Gordon S. Macklin, chairman of Hambrecht andamp; Quist Inc., aSan Francisco investment banking and securities firm, saidafter-hours markets in stocks are &quot;mostly for verysophisticated institutional traders.&quot; These markets have &quot;toomuch volatility and too little liquidity for most smallinvestors. For individual investors with the kind of dollarsmost of us think about, I think your best opportunity to getfair prices is during regular market hours.&quot;   But what about the investor who suddenly feels shaky aboutthe markets at 3 a.m.?   Says Mr. Macklin: &quot;Take two aspirin and call your brokerin the morning.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
