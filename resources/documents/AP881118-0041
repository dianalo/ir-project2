The U.S. Centers for Disease Control report Thursday came on thesame day as the Great American Smokeout, the American CancerSociety's yearly attempt to persuade smokers to give up the habit,even if just for a day.   The CDC reported that Kentucky had 176 smoking-related deaths forevery 100,000 residents in 1985; West Virginia was next, with 172.   Utah had 45 such deaths for every 100,000 people.   Nationwide, smoking-related diseases killed 314,574 Americansthat year.   The worst states, after Kentucky and West Virginia, wereArkansas, with 164 smoking-related deaths per 100,000 people in1985; Rhode Island, 164; and Florida, 161.   Best on the list, after Utah: Alaska, 54; Hawaii, 77; New Mexico,85; and Colorado, 94.   The report is based on computer analysis of statistics from 1985,the latest CDC data available.   Even though the state-by-state totals are not adjusted for age _to compensate for areas with more older or younger people _ therates provide valid ``ballpark comparisons,'' said Dr. ThomasNovotny, a specialist in the CDC's Office of Smoking and Health.   For instance, it stands to reason that Utah, with its largeMormon population that abstains from using tobacco, would have alower rate of death from smoking than other states, he said.   The report itself gave no possible explanations for the differingdeath rates.   The CDC estimates the smoking deaths through a mathematicalformula, counting deaths from diseases that can be caused by smokingand factoring in the prevalence of smoking in that particular state.   Although there might be cases not easily pinpointed _ achain-smoking Kentucky coal miner, for example _ ``thetobacco-related illnesses far outweigh the risk of otherexposures,'' Novotny said. ``These other things are not somethingthat we think will complicate the calculations enough to make theminvalid.''   ``Even as smoking prevalence declines in this country,'' the CDCsaid, ``smoking-attributable illness will continue to produce anenormous disease burden well into the 21st century.''   About 27 percent of the nation's adults are smokers, according tothe latest national estimate. Four decades ago, it was 41 percent.   ``We still have a lot of work to do to prevent people from dyingfrom smoking-related illnesses,'' Novotny said.   Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease and respiratorydisease. The surgeon general has warned of both the potentiallyfatal risks of smoking and the addictive properties of nicotine, theactive drug in cigarettes.   The CDC also examined the effects of smoking in causing prematuredeath; the agency calculated ``years of potential life'' lost, orhow far short of one's life expectancy a smoker dies. U.S. lifeexpectancy is about 72 years, depending on variables such as sex andrace.   On average, smoking deaths resulted in about 72 years of``potential life'' not lived among every 100 Americans in 1985.   Most smoking deaths, Novotny said, occur in people over age 65.``Chronic lung disease goes on for a long time,'' he said. ``You maybe alive for 20 years with it, but that doesn't mean you're notsick.''</TEXT></DOC>
