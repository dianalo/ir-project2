Reparametrizations keeping fixeda point of the circle form the quotient space Diff(S{sup 1})/S{sup 1}.The geometry of this space is relevant for string theory and string fieldtheory. We describe this space as an infinite dimensional complex manifoldwith a Kaehler metric and compute its Riemann tensor and its Ricci tensor.7 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
