The films were light-soaked in situ using the HeNe laser lightto simulate AM1 illumination. An increase in subbandgap absorption occurredpredominately near energies of 1.2eV. A simple model was developed inwhich a density of states function is hypothesized and the resultingoptical absorption at subgap energies is calculated. The measured absorptioncould be well matched in all cases by assuming a single peak of defectstates at or slightly below the Fermi level. Further, the observed changesin optical absorption due to degradation could be modeled by increasingthe density of the single peak of defect states and moving the Fermilevel towards the valence band.</TEXT></DOC>
