(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A New York businessman whose testimony isconsidered key to unraveling the Pentagon purchasing scandal pleadedguilty Thursday to bribing a high-ranking Navy official andchanneling illegal contributions to congressional campaigns.   Charles F. Gardner was joined in U.S. District Court by twoprivate consultants, James G. Neal and Kenneth F. Brooke, whopleaded guilty to other charges.   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson told reporters outside the federalcourthouse the pleas were a significant development in the2{-year-old investigation into fraud in the Defense Department's$150-billion-a-year procurement system.   ``The cooperation we will receive from these three individualswill move this investigation forward at a tremendous pace,'' Hudsonsaid.   Gardner, the former general manager of Unisys Corp.'ssurveillance and fire control systems division in Great Neck, N.Y.,pleaded guilty to charges of bribery, conspiracy to file falsestatements and aiding and assisting in the filing of a false taxreturn. He faces a maximum possible sentence of 23 years in prisonand fines of up to $750,000. .   ``Guilty. ... Guilty. ... Guilty,'' Gardner said in a strongvoice, in response to Judge Claude A. Hylton's questions on threecounts.   Prosecutors said Gardner bribed Melvyn R. Paisley, a formerassistant secretary of the Navy and the highest-ranking officialpublicly identified in the case so far.   Gardner arranged to buy Paisley's condominium at the Sun Valley,Idaho, ski resort in August 1986 for an inflated price, thegovernment said in court documents.   ``Gardner instructed James G. Neal that the condominium was to bepurchased for $149,000 and that no negotiation or attempts to lowerthe price were to be undertaken, even though the unit wasoverpriced,'' Hudson said in a statement. ``The condominium wassubsequently sold for $100,000.''   The suggestion that Gardner buy Paisley's condominium came fromWilliam Galvin, another private consultant who is Brooke'sstepfather, the government said.   U.S. Attorney Hudson said the condominium purchase was designedto influence Paisley's actions on two Pentagon contracts sought byUnisys, one on the Aegis automated radar firing system and the otheron the Marine air traffic and landing system. Unisys eventuallyreceived a portion of the $9 billion Aegis contract.   Paisley, now a private consultant, has not been charged with anycrime. But prosecutors said that between May 1986 and November 1986,Paisley ``performed certain official acts to benefit'' Unisys withregard to the two contracts.   Another charge against Gardner stems from $1,000 corporatecontributions made in 1986 and 1987 to the campaigns of Rep. RoyDyson, D-Md., and former Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla., both members ofa House committee that handled defense issues. Dyson and Chappellhave denied knowing that illegal contributions were funneled totheir campaigns.   In January, Robert D. Barrett, a former Unisys executive, pleadedguilty to charges stemming from the complicated scheme to makeillegal campaign contributions.   Prosecutors said Gardner amassed a slush fund by hiring``consultants'' to Unisys with the understanding that some of themoney would be placed ``in bank accounts, both domestic and foreign,for purposes of bribery, illegal campaign contributions, and in partfor ... Gardner's personal use.''   Hudson's investigation has been looking into the question ofwhether defense companies hired private consultants who, in turn,paid bribes to public officials to obtain inside informationvaluable for obtaining Pentagon contracts.   Unisys welcomed Gardner's plea, the company said in a statementreleased from its headquarters in Blue Bell, Pa. ``The UnisysCorp.'s board, management and employees have been outraged by Mr.Gardner's illegal activities and the negative reflection cast on theimage of our new company,'' the statement said.   As part of Gardner's arrangement with Neal, the privateconsultant set up a web of seven companies in order to receive moneyfrom Unisys and its predecessor, Sperry Corp., the government said.Unisys is a giant computer corporation.   Most of the companies were located in Northern Virginia, but onewas in the United Kingdom and another in the Cayman Islands.   The government also said Gardner caused Unisys to ``make andpresent to the departments of the Navy and Air Force false,fictitious and fraudulent claims upon and against the UnitedStates.''   Neal, 63, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to bribe Garland TomlinJr., who was a Navy engineer with the Naval Electronics SystemsCommand until his retirement in October 1985.   On instructions from Gardner, Neal transferred in 1983 and 1984 atotal of $400,000 to Longwood International, a company owned byTomlin, in order to influence Tomlin's official decisions,prosecutors said. Tomlin has not been charged with any crime.   Neal pleaded guilty to making false claims to the government andconspiring to defraud the government by concealing his true taxableincome. He faces up to 15 years in prison and fines of $750,000.   Brooke, 40, pleaded guilty to evading about $66,000 in taxes in1985, prosecutors said. He faces a possible sentence of five yearsin prison and a fine of up to $250,000.   The judge set sentencing for July 14.</TEXT></DOC>
