The widespread showers and forecasts of more rain this week washed away traders' concern, at least for the time being, that a summer drought would slash harvests and boost crop prices.    &quot;Rain makes grain,&quot; said a Chicago Board of Trade floor trader, using a market adage.    Corn, soybean and soybean meal futures led the collapse, with most contracts plunging the daily limit. Soybeans for July delivery fell 30 cents a bushel to $5.51.    The price collapse in the grain pits, together with the dollar's advance and a slide by precious metal prices, at least temporarily dampened traders' inflation concerns, said Richard Loewy, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securites Inc. in New York.    Last week, a weather-inspired grain rally fueled inflation concerns, lifting commodity prices across the board.    The weekend thunderstorms moistened fields from Nebraska to Ohio, and more rain is expected later this week, meteorologists said. However, the rains largely bypassed the driest sections of the Corn Belt, where the recent lack of moisture has forced some farmers to delay soybean planting. And most meteorologists expect hot, dry weather to return to the Midwest by next weekend.    Still, brief but torrential rains drenched northern Illinois and northern Indiana -- where most CBOT floor traders live.    &quot;A lot of people who trade in the markets saw it raining cats and dogs,&quot; said David Taylor, chief climatologist at Weather Services Corp. in Bedford, Mass.    Harvey Freese of Freese-Notis Weather Inc. in Des Moines, Iowa, noted &quot;It rained on LaSalle Street,&quot; where the CBOT sits. &quot;That's a big psychological factor.&quot;    Anticipating the price collapse, many farmers sold grain heavily over the weekend, driving down cash-market prices and fueling the futures price declines. A record South American soybean crop also weighed down futures.    Although wheat futures also fell sharply, they were buoyed somewhat by the announcement that the Soviet Union agreed to buy 450,000 metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat.    The Agriculture Department said the wheat was sold at $80 a ton, about the same as the previous sale of 950,000 tons announced 10 days ago. The United States is subsidizing the sale at $44.40 a ton, about 26 cents a ton more than the previous sale but less than expected.    This season the Soviets have bought 1.4 million tons of U.S. wheat. The U.S. has offered to subsidize Soviet purchases of as much as 4 million tons.    In other futures markets yesterday:    COPPER: Prices fell despite a sharp drop in London Metal Exchange inventories. The price declines, along with declines in precious metal prices, occurred amid apparently easing concern about inflation, analysts said. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, copper for July delivery ended the day down 2.45 cents a pound at 65.45 cents, after sinking to the day's low of 64.70 cents. Because the copper market looked overbought the past two weeks amid a more-than-seven cents advance, there wasn't as strong a reaction as expected, analysts said, to the news that the London warehouse supplies were down 17,150 metric tons Friday, at 129,300 tons, the lowest level since March. A metric ton is equal to 1.1 U.S. short tons, or 2,204.6 pounds. Yesterday, there was selling by speculators to cut losses and selling by producers and merchants to establish prices for their supplies, analysts said. Demand developed at the day's lows, enabling prices to recover slightly.    COFFEE: Prices fell despite Brazilian claims of tight supplies. July coffee fell 1.46 cents a pound to $1.2354. Traders tended to discount statements by the Brazilian Coffee Institute that supplies were small as the harvest begins in that country, analysts said. Traders figure &quot;Brazil is holding about five million bags of coffee and that the Bank of Brazil is also holding a substantial supply as collateral&quot; for farm loans, said Sandra Kaul, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. Just &quot;two to four weeks ago&quot; the institute was trying to decide whether to auction coffee they hadn't been able to sell, Ms. Kaul said. A green-coffee importer said there is sufficient supply in Brazil until the harvest gets into full swing next month. &quot;The problem is quality,&quot; he said. &quot;Buyers are encountering tight supplies of good-quality coffee and are having to pay higher prices.&quot;    ENERGY: Crude oil for immediate delivery rose to a life-of-contract high of almost $20 a barrel, but most other oil futures prices closed with slight losses. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, June crude oil rose nine cents a barrel to $19.89, stemming in part from uncertainty in the Mideast after the Iraqi attack on a U.S. frigate, analysts said. Although some traders said the attack renews concern about the Iran-Iraq war and could heighten tensions in the oil-rich Persian Gulf area, most other oil futures contracts lost ground because of profit-taking amid a broad decline in commodity prices. &quot;It was a disinflationary type of day, and that took the wind out of people's sails across the floor,&quot; a trader said.    INTEREST RATES: Prices soared almost a point after the Federal Reserve Board defied traders' expectations and failed to add reserves to the banking system shortly before noon EDT. Collapsing commodity prices also gave Treasury bond futures a boost, traders said. The Fed's move &quot;reassured bond traders that the Fed is maybe tightening credit a little bit&quot; in an attempt to curb rising inflation, said Frederick Leiner, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in Chicago. The dollar's advance also bolstered bond futures prices, Mr. Leiner said. Traders said rising bond and bond futures prices ought to boost stock and stock-index futures in the next few days. </TEXT></DOC>
