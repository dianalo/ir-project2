(SoftwareReview) (One of three evaluations of asynchronous communicationssoftware packages for multitasking in 'Comm programs supportWindows 3.0') (evaluation)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Schuyler, Chet; Curry, Jennifer.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Microphone II for Windows is a $295 multitasking communicationssoftware package from Software Ventures Corp. It compares veryfavorably with Crosstalk for Windows and DynaComm 3.0, despite itslack of dynamic data exchange and local area network support.andP;  Ithas the most automated and highest quality script generator of thethree packages evaluated, enabling editing even as the script isrecorded.andP;  Error messages clearly indicate the location of anyproblems and the sample scripts are well done.andP;  Microphone II maybe especially appropriate for installations that are heavilyinvested in both Apple Macintosh and MS-DOS, MS WindowsIBM-compatible microcomputers because its scripts are portablebetween the two.andP;  This portability as well as the excellent scriptlanguage are features mentioned by users who prefer Microphone II.andO;It has both power and ease of use.andP;  Its one drawback is aninsufficient number of file transfer protocols.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Software Ventures Corp. (products).andO;Product:   MicroPhone II for Windows (Communications software).andO;Topic:     EvaluationCommunications software.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Software Ventures Corp.andM;MICROPHONE II FOR WINDOWS 1.0andM;Microphone II is an import from the Macintosh world; this version for Windows3.0 represents the product's first venture into the PC world.andP;  While gapsremain in this implementation (such as a lack of LAN and DDE support),Microphone II is still an excellent product in many respects.andM;Microphone II has the best script-development environment in the reviewedgroup.andM;Watch Me is Microphone's automatic script generator, which displays thescript as it is generated and allows the user to edit lines while the scriptcontinues to be recorded.andM;The Script editor eases the building of scripts by providing a separatewindow of commands that are available to be placed in the script with asimple point and click of the mouse.andP;  Executing scripts can be traced toidentify the line in which an error occurs.andM;The Custom Interfaces Guide explains how to build a custom interface to anon-line mail environment.andP;  A good library of example scripts is included forCompuServe, MCI and GEnie.andM;The portability of scripts between the Macintosh and Windows 3.0 on the PC isan incentive to consider Microphone II for those sites with a number ofMacintosh Microphone users.andP;  Imported scripts are automatically reviewed byMicrophone II's import facility, and invalid lines in the new environment aretagged for editing.andM;While Microphone II includes a more limited set of transfer protocols thanits competitors, it does forgive the user for choosing the wrongtransfer-protocol driver by automatically adjusting (&quot;cascading&quot; inMicrophonese) through five Ymodem and Xmodem protocols to coordinate with theremote system.andM;On the down side, Microphone II only supports TTY, VT52 and VT100 terminalemulations.andP;  Users cannot click text on the screen and have it passed to thehost.andM;Perhaps owing to its Mac heritage, Microphone II has by far the prettiesticons, but it has such a proliferation of them that it drives home thefailure of Windows to support hierarchies of program windows.andP;  In Windows, anicon within a program group cannot be used to represent a separateprogram-group window.andM;Software Ventures Corp., of Berkeley, Calif., can be reached at (415)644-3232.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;&quot;I like Microphone II because it supports a very sophisticated scriptlanguage, and it's portable from the Mac to the PC,&quot; said Bill Cook,technical adviser at Pitney-Bowes Inc. in Stamford, Conn.. &quot;Automatedprocedures that were formerly able to run only on the Mac are now availableon the PC.andM;&quot;I think it is an excellent product,&quot; he continued.andP;  &quot;In its simplest form,it's as easy to use as any terminal emulator, but it has the power behind itto be the best communications package available.&quot;andM;Mike Ullman, advanced technology consultant at Rockwell International Corp.andO;in Seal Beach, Fla., noted that although Procomm is the primary product usedby the company, he prefers Microphone II.andM;&quot;I like it because, unlike Procomm, it's Windows-based.andP;  The scripts that arewritten are compatible with the Mac, and it's easy to use,&quot; he said.andM;The lack of file-transfer protocols, he said, is Microphone II's onlyshortcoming.andM;Doug Eldred, a consultant at Control Data Corp., a systems-integration firmbased, Bloomington, Minn., previously used Procomm, but said he prefersMicrophone II due to its powerful scripting capabilities.andM;&quot;Primarily, I'm a Mac user, and the interface of Microphone is similiar tothe Mac,&quot; Eldred said.andM;&quot;I like the ability to have the scripts compatible with the PC and theMacintosh.andP;  It's important for me, in a shop with a mixture of both PCs andMacs, to be able to transport my Mac scripts to the PC, and vice-versa,&quot; hecommented.andM;Chris Hagin, associate editor for the Atlanta-based Metropolitan BusinessPublications, said he prefers Microphone II to Crosstalk and DynaComm.andM;&quot;The macros are easier to write than Crosstalk.andP;  Microphone II is moreintuitive.andP;  DynaComm is a dinosaur -- it's impossible to use because it'soverly technical, and it doesn't have macro facilities,&quot; he said.andM;Hagin finds fault with the product Microphone II because it doesn't supportDDE.andP;  &quot;If it had DDE, I could use Current [personal information managementsoftware from IBM] to schedule the pickup of information.&quot;andM;He did say, however, that the on-line help facility is superb.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
