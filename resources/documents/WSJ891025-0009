The suit, filed in federal trial court in Des Moines, Iowa, where Meredith is based, alleges that the diversified media company's relocation unit cheated the government by misrepresenting the value of government employees' homes. The government contract required Meredith Relocation Corp. to purchase employees' homes based on independent appraisals. The Justice Department alleges that the company &quot;engaged in various forms of misrepresentation&quot; with the goal of reducing the appraised value of employees' homes.    In the suit, the department seeks to recover $7.7 million in costs incurred when the government terminated its contract with Meredith Relocation and sought other contracts to replace it. The department also said it seeks &quot;three times the government's damages, which are presently undetermined, plus penalties.&quot;    Officials with Meredith didn't have any immediate comment on the suit. </TEXT></DOC>
