The opposition, which failed to unify before the election,charged the government was manipulating vote-counting computersafter a state-run television station reported Monday that agoverning party candidate had won with 39 percent of the vote.   The MBC network said a local affiliate on Cheju Islandaccidentally broadcast an election rehearsal. The network said itfired the station manager and four other officials.   Seoul prosecutors today said their counterparts on Cheju Islandwere investigating whether election laws were violated by thebroadcast.   The state-controlled KBS television network, meanwhile, reportedafter the polls closed that five governing party members and threeopposition candidates were leading their races.   In Seoul, police fired tear gas to disperse 300 YonseiUniversity students who threw rocks and firebombs to protestalleged election manipulation in favor of the governing DemocraticJustice Party of President Roh Tae-woo.   Earlier, police broke up a similar protest by 50 Yonseistudents. No injuries were reported in either demonstration.   In the afternoon, hundreds of students dashed through alleys andsidestreets in Seoul's downtown Myongdong shopping area, shoutingslogans against ``election rigging'' and chanting ``Down withdictatorship.''   Police pursued them, sometimes hurling tear gas grenades. At onepoint, citizens rescued a student being dragged away by riot police.   Yonhap, the Korean news agency, said police arrested more 120students in Kwangju and nearby areas in southwestern South Korea.   In the southern city of Chonju, about 500 dissidents andopposition supporters battled riot police in the streets for nearlytwo hours.   Voting began at 7 a.m. at 13,812 pollings stations nationwide tochoose a 299-member National Assembly.   The polls closed at 6 p.m. (5 a.m. EDT). Most returns wereexpected by early Wednesday.   Officials estimated 72.6 percent of the 26.2 million registeredvoters turned out, down from 84.6 percent in the 1985 legislativeelections and 89.2 percent in the December presidential election.   Opposition leader Kim Young-sam of the Reunification DemocraticParty, who ran for an assembly seat in the southern city of Pusan,accused the government of staging ``unfair, unjust electionsunprecedented in our history.''   On Monday, the governing party expelled one candidate after4,296 envelopes, each containing the equivalent of about $30 andcampaign leaflets for Democratic Justice candidate Kwon Joong-dong,were intercepted by opposition members at a post office in Andong,south of Seoul. Police reported 90 cases of election-relatedviolence nationwide in the campaign, with more than 150 peopledetained and 77 of them formally charged.   A 90-second broadcast on Monday on southern Cheju Island by anaffiliate of the state-controlled MBC national television networksaid a governing party candidate had won in a local district and itgave vote totals.   The network later apologized for what it called a technicalerror by engineers during a rehearsal for scheduled live broadcastof the ballot count.   But protesters said the use of definite numbers in the broadcastwas proof the government planned to manipulate the computer votecount.   About 400 students in Cheju marched in the streets early today,protesting ``an unforgivable government attempt at computermanipulation.''   Students in Kwangju, Chonju, Pusan and Cheju also held ralliesto denounce the broadcast and vowed to launch more anti-governmentprotests.   Later, however, an official at the Central Election ManagementCommittee said: ``The voting is proceeding relatively smoothly.''   Roh's rising popularity and a split within the opposition wereexpected to help the Democratic Justice Party win a majority in theNational Assembly.   Public support for the opposition eroded after its leaders, KimDae-jung of the Party for Peace and Democracy and Kim Young-sam,both insisted on running in the December presidential election,splitting the opposition vote. Roh won the first directpresidential election in 16 years with 36 percent of the vote.   The opposition gained momentum in widespread anti-governmentprotests last June. Roh, then chairman of the Democratic JusticeParty, agreed to many of the democratic reforms demanded by theopposition and the political climate has become freer.   The governing party, campaigning on pledges of stability foreconomic and democratic progress, hoped to win about 125 of the 224seats being decided in single-member districts, along with 38 ofthe 75 seats to be decided by the parties' nationwide voteproportions.   A new constitution that took effect in February gives theNational Assembly greater power in such matters as inspecting stateaffairs, and the president no longer can dissolve it.</TEXT></DOC>
