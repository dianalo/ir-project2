The Pentagon and CIA oppose the sales because intelligenceexperts believe the supercomputers could be used to help designnuclear weapons and missiles, the source said on Sunday.   The Commerce and State departments favor the exports, the sourcesaid.   ``There is a deadlock between the agencies and it's going to comeup to the White House for a political decision,'' said the source,who spoke Sunday on condition that he not be identified.   ``Israel, Brazil and India are without question pursuingactivities related to either nuclear weapons or long-range missiles,or both,'' the congressional source said. ``And with the facilitieswhich they (the supercomputers) are going to, there is ample reasonto believe there are either direct or indirect connections'' to theweapons programs.   At issue are applications to export a Cray Research Inc.supercomputer to Technion, a technical university in Israel; an IBMsupercomputer for the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil; another IBMmachine for Embraer S.A., an aircraft enterprise largely owned bythe Brazilian government; and a Cray computer for the IndianInstitute of Technology in Bangalore.   ``You have the State Department trying to smooth relations withfriendly nations, you have the Commerce Department trying to promoteexports,'' said the source, who is closely involved with nuclearproliferation issues.   ``On the other hand, you've got the intelligence communityconcerned, No. 1, about illicit uses of those computers, and No. 2,about possible Soviet access to some of those systems.''   Objections to the proposed supercomputer exports were voiced atmeetings earlier this year held by the Special Nuclear ExportCommittee, or SNEC, a panel of senior federal agency staff members.   After SNEC failed to reach a consensus, the issue was referred toa group of higher-level officials from various agencies, the PolicyCoordinating Committee, chaired by Reginald Bartholomew,undersecretary of state for security assistance, science andtechnology.   Gary Milhollin, a professor at the University of Wisconsin LawSchool and expert on the spread of nuclear weapons, said thesupercomputer dispute remains before the Policy CoordinatingCommittee.   ``They're kicking it around, but they haven't come to adecision,'' he said. ``Cray has been lobbying very strenuously toget these exports approved. And the Commerce Department is verysympathetic. So it's possible the Commerce Department couldshort-circuit this Policy Coordinating Committee and just decide thecase on its own.''   Whatever course the administration takes on the supercomputerissue, Milhollin said it will have broad implications for futureexports of other sensitive products.   ``I think that when the United States decides what to export byway of dual-use (military and non-military) items ... one of theprimary considerations should be the precedential effect of theexport on U.S. credibility,'' Milhollin said.   He pointed to a recent tightening of export regulations by WestGermany after U.S. officials voiced strong concerns over theinvolvement of German firms with construction of a suspectedchemical-weapons plant in Libya.   ``When a really terrible export decision by a foreign countrycomes up, we're not going to have any credibility in trying toreverse it, if we are going to send dual-use items to countries suchas India, Israel and Brazil,'' Milhollin said.   The nuclear proliferation expert said there currently is noevidence that these countries would get supercomputers from Japan ifthe United States refuses to supply the machines.   ``My understanding is that the Japanese are not competing forthese sales,'' Milhollin said. ``It's conceivable that if we don'tmake these sales, sometime in the future Japan could make them. Butnobody knows whether the time will ever arrive.''</TEXT></DOC>
