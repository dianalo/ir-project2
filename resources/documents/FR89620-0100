Itestimates the loan authority that is expected to be available in each HUDRegional Office jurisdiction. Each HUD Field Office has published an Invitationfor Applications for section 202 Fund Reservation (Invitation) for itsjurisdiction indicating the amount of loan authority available in the Regionfor housing for handicapped people and the maximum number of units thisamount is expected to assist. (A separate invitation announced the amountavailable for housing for the elderly.) The loan authority available in each Region will not have a specific percentagedesignated for use in metropolitan or nonmetropolitan areas. The emphasisof this program is primarily on the range of services provided to the handicappedresidents in the projects, the opportunities for independent living andparticipation in normal activities, and access by the handicapped residentsto the community at large and to employment opportunities. HUD believesthat it is in the best interest of the program to fund the highest-rankedapplications designed to meet these objectives, regardless of whether thelocation of the project is in a nonmetropolitan or metropolitan area. Accordingly,the program regulations do not include a nonmetropolitan allocation requirement.In accordance with the Appropriations Act reference to providing priorityfor homeless chronically mentally ill people and an accompanying Congressionaldirective to fund 950 units for deinstitutionalized chronically mentallyill people, a proportionate share of the funds available in each Regionwill be designated to serve that population. For this purpose, the term``homeless chronically mentally ill people'' includes deinstitutionalizedpersons and those who are at risk of becoming homeless. Applications for projects to serve homeless chronically mentally ill peoplewill compete against each other; similarly, applications for projects toserve people with all other handicaps will compete against each other.If a Region has insufficient approvable applications in either category,it may make selections from the other category. <ITAG tagnum="84">Schedule for Section 202 Invitations, Workshops and Application Deadline</ITAG>To be considered for FY 1989 funding, applications for projects for nonelderlyphysically handicapped, developmentally disabled or chronically mentallyill people must be submitted under this Notice of Fund Availability. Sponsorsmust identify proposed project occupancy requirements that limit occupancyto one or more of the eligible groups. Proposals to serve more than oneoccupancy group in a single project require Headquarters review for approval.All applications for section 202 Fund Reservations must be filed with theappropriate HUD Field Office by eligible sponsors as defined in 24 CFR885.5 and must contain all exhibits and additional information as requiredby the regulation at Section 885.710. HUD Field Offices have published a one-time Invitation in newspapers ofgeneral circulation, and in minority newspapers serving the Field Officejurisdiction. Field Offices will accept applications after publicationof the Invitation. Applications must be received at the appropriate FieldOffice by its regular closing time on July 6, 1989, unless that time isextended by Notice published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Applications received after that date and timewill not be accepted, even if postmarked by the deadline date. Organizations interested in applying for a Section 202 Fund Reservationshould provide the appropriate Field Office with their names, addressesand telephone numbers, advise the Field Office whether they wish to attendthe workshop described in the following paragraph, and secure the HousingNotice and Application Package. HUD encourages minority organizations toparticipate in this program as Sponsors. Field Offices are conducting workshops to explain the Section 202 programand the Seed Money Loan program under Section 106(b) of the Housing andUrban Development Act of 1968. Under this latter program, HUD makes direct,interest-free loans to approved nonprofit Section 202 eligible Borrowersto cover certain pre-construction expenses. At the workshops, ApplicationPackages will be distributed, application procedures and requirements (includingthe Department's equal opportunity, design and cost containment guidanceand required exhibits) will be discussed, and concerns such as local marketconditions, building codes, zoning and housing costs will be addressed.HUD strongly recommends that prospective Sponsors attend the local FieldOffice workshop. More detailed information covering the time and placeof the particular workshops are provided in the Field Office Invitation.Interested disabled persons should contact the Field Office to assure thatany necessary arrangements can be made for them to be able to attend andparticipate in the workshop. <ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Information </ITAG>(1) Elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, HUD has published a final rule implementingSection 162 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987. Thissection amended Section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 as it applies todevelopment of housing for nonelderly handicapped people. The Fiscal Year1989 funding selections will be governed by the new regulation, codifiedat 24 CFR Part 885, Subpart C. (2) Because of the concern expressed by Congress for homeless chronicallymentally ill people, Sponsors serving primarily this population are encouragedto submit applications under this NOFA. (3) In evaluating applications for Section 202 Fund Reservations for housingfor handicapped residents, only those proposals that meet certain thresholdscores on the standard ranking format will be considered for funding. However,Headquarters may waive the threshold score in order to fund proposals tothe extent necessary to meet the requirement that not less than 25 percentof the loan authority be reserved for applications for housing for nonelderlypeople with handicaps and to fulfill the goal of 950 units for homelessor deinstitutionalized chronically mentally ill people. The threshold requirementwill be included in the Section 202 Application Package available at thelocal HUD Field Office. The Section 202 workshops will include discussionsof this and other application requirements. (4) Applications that meet the following optional criteria will be eligiblefor additional points on the standard ranking format: (a) Applications that include evidence of control of an approvable siteunder andSection; 885.780 will be awarded up to 10 points. (b) Applications receiving points for site control and which propose touse acquisition with or without moderate rehabilitation will receive upto five additional points. (5) HUD unit limits for housing for nonelderly handicapped people (otherthan the chronically mentally ill) permit group homes to serve up to 15persons on one site, and independent living complexes to include up to24 units serving no more than 24 households on one site. For purposes ofthis requirement, a household is a family or any individual. Two unrelatedindividuals sharing a two bedroom unit will be counted as two householdsin calculating the 24 household limit. Independent living complexes comprisedof three or more bedroom units may be developed only to serve one or twoparents or guardians with children; these complexes may not be developedto serve large numbers of single unrelated persons. (6) Projects designed exclusively for chronically mentally ill people areeligible under the same conditions and criteria as other projects designedsolely for nonelderly handicapped people, except that only group homesfor up to 15 persons and independent living complexes to serve up to 20persons may be proposed for the chronically mentally ill. (7) To be responsive to the Invitation, an application must not requestmore units in a given Region than advertised for that Region in the Invitation.Applications exceeding these limits will be rejected.(8) Sponsors will be required to complete a Service Plan Description, describinghow their proposed projects will be linked to supportive services neededto maintain their handicapped residents in the community. Since funds forsuch services cannot be provided from the rental assistance subsidy, evidenceof other funding sources must be provided, with assurances that the fundswill be secured by the time the project is ready for occupancy and willcontinue to be available for a reasonable time thereafter. Sponsors areadvised that if at any time these supporting funds are not available, theproject will have to be converted to occupancy by handicapped persons orfamilies capable of living independently without the supportive services.To assist HUD in evaluating the Sponsor's capabilities with regard to supportiveservices for the residents of group homes or independent living complexes,HUD will invite a representative from the State Mental Health Agency (SMHA),the State Rehabilitation Agency, or the State Administrative Agency forDevelopmental Disabilities, as appropriate, to evalaute and make recommendationsabout the Service Plan Description. To this end, prospective Sponsors maybe required to submit a copy of the Application to the appropriate StateAgency. The HUD Field Office will advise prospective Sponsors of furtherdetails in this regard. Since the review and evaluation is at the optionof the State Agency, HUD will conduct its own independent review for thoseStates that do not wish to participate. (9) Section 202 loans may be used for the acquisition of existing housingand related facilities, with or without moderate rehabilitation (``acquisition'')for group homes for the nonelderly handicapped. Proposals involving housingunits already owned and operated by the Sponsor as group homes for handicappedresidents at the time Applications are submitted (often referred to as``refinancing'') are not eligible for acquisition or rehabilitation underthe Section 202 program. (10) Where the proposed project site is being optioned or acquired froma general contractor or its affiliate, the Section 202 Borrower will beprohibited from selecting that contractor to construct the project forwhich an Application for funding is being made. Further, the proposed contractormay not be the attorney, architect, housing consultant or management agentfor the project. This prohibition extends to any firm or subsidiary havingan identity-of-interest with the contractor. (11) Religious bodies may serve as project Sponsors, but must establisha Borrower corporation as a separate legal entity to be the owner, priorto the submission of a loan commitment application. When the Borrower corporationis created, no reference to religion or religious purposes may be includedin the Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws of that corporation. The mererecital on a Borrower's Articles of Incorporation that it is organizedexclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary or educationalpurposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal RevenueCode will not by itself make a Borrower ineligible. However, the dissolutionclause must provide that, upon dissolution or winding up of the corporation,its assets remaining after payment of all debts and liabilities shall bedistributed to a nonprofit fund, foundation or corporation, other thanone created for a religious purpose, which has established its tax-exemptstatus under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. (12) Sponsors, including churches, must have a current IRS nonprofit taxexemption ruling. (13) Because of the nonprofit nature of the Section 202 program, no officeror director of the Sponsor or Borrower, or trustee, member, stockholderor authorized representative of the Borrower is permitted to have any financialinterest in any contract in connection with the provision of services,the provision of goods or supplies, project management, procurement offurnishings and equipment, construction of the project, procurement ofthe site or other matters whatsoever, except that this prohibition doesnot apply to management contracts (or management fees associated therewith)entered into by the Borrower with the Sponsor or its nonprofit affiliate.(14) 24 CFR 885.810(i) contains a minimum capital investment requirement.This requirement applies to all Section 202 projects receiving fund reservationsin Fiscal Year 1989. The minimum capital investment is currently establishedat one-half of 1 percent (0.5%) of the total HUD-approved mortgage amount,not to exceed $10,000. Section 106(b) Seed Money Loan Funds, under 24 CFRPart 271, may not be used to satisfy the minimum capital investment requirement.(15) Applications missing two or more exhibits will be rejected. If Applicationsare found to have incomplete exhibits, the Sponsor will be advised in writingof the deficiencies and that missing documents will be accepted on or beforea specified date. Further, all necessary actions (<T3>e.g.</T3>, adoption of corporate resolutions) must have been takenon or before the deadline date for filing applications. Sponsors may becontacted if clarification of any part of the application is needed inorder to evalaute the application. (16) HUD will make contract and budget authority under Section 202(h)(4)of the Housing Act of 1959 available for successful Sponsors, subject tothe availability of funds. (17) A notice of approval will be sent to the Sponsors selected in accordancewith the requirements of 24 CFR 885.750 (Review of Application for FundReservation) and on the basis of information furnished by the Sponsorsas set forth in the Field Office Application Package. (18) To the extent that funds are available to fund new projects for handicappedpeople from the Headquarters Reserve (which Reserve shall constitute nomore than 15 percent of the Section 202 Fiscal Year 1989 loan authoritydesignated for projects for handicapped people), applications which areotherwise approvable but not funded by the Regional Offices from the fieldallocation may be considered for Headquarters funding on the basis of supportfor the needs of the handicapped, one of the conditions set forth in Section213(d)(4) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. (19) Sponsors are invited to submit applications for Section 202 Fund Reservationsfor housing for nonelderly handicapped persons in accordance with thisNotice and with 24 CFR Part 885.
