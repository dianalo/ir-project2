Scientists at Wilmington, Del.-based Hercules reported thediscovery of a new way to control the tiny liquid crystalsthat are the core technology in laptop-computer screens,digital-watch faces and other common electronic products.Instead of using tiny electrodes to make the crystals showletters and other patterns on a screen, the scientists founda way to write and erase patterns with laser light.</LP><TEXT>   The discovery, to be reported in today's issue of Nature,a leading British science journal, is a long way frompractical application and may end up being used only torefine the existing techniques for making liquid crystaldisplays, or LCDs. Speculation about commercial use &quot;ispie-in-the-sky stuff right now,&quot; warned Hercules researchphysicist Wayne M. Gibbons. Among the drawbacks, otherscientists said, is that the Hercules prototypes can't switchbetween light and dark as quickly as today's LCDs.   But the discovery highlights the intensive scientificeffort in the U.S. and Europe to overtake Japanese labs inthis crucial area of electronics technology. Japanesecompanies control key patents and manufacturing know-how fortoday's LCDs, giving them a hammerlock on the booming worldmarket for portable computers, whose thin, lightweightscreens are driven by LCDs. To build their own laptop andnotebook computers, such U.S. and European computer makers asInternational Business Machines Corp. and Italy's Ing. C.Olivetti andamp; Co. have been forced to get technical help fromJapanese rivals.   In recent years, however, the non-Japanese companies havebeen pumping more cash into their own LCD research, in searchof new and better techniques that could topple the Japanese.Though the immediate commercial rewards have been slim, agrowing number of promising scientific reports are comingfrom U.S. and European labs.   The Hercules discovery was actually made in 1987 but keptquiet until the recent issuance of a patent for it, said Mr.Gibbons.   Liquid crystals are molecules that exist in a limbo world,part-way between the orderly state of a solid crystal and theamorphous phase of a liquid. Typically, today's displays aremade by sandwiching the liquid crystals inside individual,tiny cells of specially coated glass. At the factory, theglass is rubbed with a nylon cloth, making all the rod-likemolecules line up in the same direction and transmit anylight shown from behind them. But if a weak electric chargeis applied, the molecules twist and block the light.Assembling many of these tiny cells in a computer screen orwatch face can form light-and-dark patterns, representingprinted numbers or letters.   The Hercules method gets the molecules to line up byshining a beam of laser light on the glass cells. Then,subsequent flashes of laser light can flip the molecules backand forth, between dark and bright states. Because tiny laserbeams, rather than relatively clumsy electrodes, are used toswitch the liquid crystals, in theory much finer screenpatterns could be created with such methods. At this earlystage of research, however, the actual resolution achievedonly matches today's LCDs, Mr. Gibbons said.   The Hercules method is based on blending a special dyeinto the glass coating of each cell. The laser light movesthe dye molecules, which in turn affect the liquid crystalsnext to them.</TEXT></DOC>
