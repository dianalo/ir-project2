(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) dedicatednew headquarters Saturday and celebrated the coming together of thechurch, split over a century ago into two parts.   And a South African religious leader called on those attending anecumenical worship service to be more active in the fight againstapartheid, or racial segregation.   The Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance ofReformed Churches, said churches can no longer be content only tospeak against injustice and racial bigotry.   ``If the church would only see ... the pain and suffering of theworld. If our eyes would only open to see the task of the church tostand where God stands, against all injustice and pain andsuffering,'' Boesak said.   Boesak, who is a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in SouthAfrica, was warmly received by the more than 2,000 people who filledthe Kentucky Center for the Arts to begin the daylong welcome forthe religious group.   The service included messages from other religious leaders in thecommunity, including Dr. Roy L. Honeycutt, president of the SouthernBaptist Seminary in Louisville and the Most Rev. Thomas C. Kelly,archbishop of Louisville's Catholics.   Proceeds from the collection at the service were turned over tothe Louisville Coalition for the Homeless. Church leaders said theypicked the group to emphasize that while the denomination had founda home, others still had none.   Presbyterians split in 1861 and only rejoined one another in1983. Previous headquarters were located in New York and Atlanta.   David Jones, chairman of the board of Humana Inc., donated thetwo buildings that now form the new headquarters. The buildings hadonce been two hardware warehouses.   `Since our reunion in 1983, we have been on a journey. Now,thanks to your gift, we have a home,'' said the Rev. C. KennethHall, moderator of the General Assembly and chairman of thededication committee.   Jones, who is a Presbyterian layman, formally turned over thestructure. A new plaque unveiled states that the building was``Dedicated to the Glory of God.''</TEXT></DOC>
