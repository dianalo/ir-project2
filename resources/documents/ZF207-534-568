There's pressure onthe Government to introduce legisandM;Emma Nicholson MP has just faded to get her anti-hacking bill throughparliament after its second reading.andP;  The bill has been withdrawn, butaccording to Nicholson, it has served its purpose by stirring up interest inthe issue.andM;Home Secretary Douglas Hurd has promised that there will now be legislationin the Queen's speech to outlaw unauthorized entry into protected computersystems.andP;  In a speech to the Council of European Justice Ministers in theHague - whose own committee's report is expected to recommend that the mostdamaging forms of hacking should be made illegal in Europe - Hurd said theGovernment will introduce a bill in the Autumn, and is already working on adraft version.andM;The findings of the Scottish Law Commission, which has already reported on teissue, and the recommendations of the English Law commission, which will bepublished in Septomber, will be taken into account.andM;The Government, over ahundred large companies which backed the Nicholson Billand most of die Mis (Management Information System) staff we spoke to, agreethat there should be some way for firms and individuals who suffer damagebecause of hacking, to take legal action.andM;The extent to which hackers cause damage if they do no more than enter thesystem, leave a message to prove it and then leave peacefully, must beexamined.andM;&quot;Prohibited information is vital to the individuals or organization, andshould he protected,&quot; said Atul Patel, analyst programmer at Hertz Rentacar.andO;&quot;A lot of money has to be spent on acquiring and storing it, and it should bestrictly confidential.andP;  Who knows what a hacker might do with it - sell it toa competitor, for example?&quot;andM;Geoffrey Soma, PC support specialist at Agfa Gevaert, takes a different view.andO;&quot;Most hacking is on such a small scale that it does no harm at all, it's justamusing,&quot; he said, &quot;The results of malicious hacking, like fraud, are illegaltoday, but it's a bit like making prostitution illegal, which hasn't stoppedit in thousands of years.&quot;andM;To some extent all users have a responsibility to ensure their systems aresecure, in a similar way to house-owners.andP;  If you're burgled and the policefind the front door has no lock on it, they're unlikely to be verysympathetic.andP;  Similarly, there's an onus on users to ensure there is adequatesecurity, and on the state to make legal provision.andP;  The question is wherethe fine should be drawn: how much protection should be provided bytechnology and how much by law? &quot;Pure hacking is a different matter frompeople who go in with intent to do malicious damage,&quot; said and MIS manager ina large food company, who asked not to be identifies.andP;  &quot;In any case , themore sensible way is to take internal procedures to make the data moresecure.&quot; He suggested keeping the number of modem finks to a minimum andinstituting strong internal disclipinary measures against inhouse activities.andO;&quot;Our data isn't very attractive to the public, but in the end, it's thecustomer who ends up paying the extra security cost to prevent them fromdoing damage.&quot; Soma indicates that in most incidents we hear about, banks andother organizations hit by fraud are happy to pay hackers and let them gofree in order to find out how it was done.andP;  &quot;Making it illegal won't changethat situation, it's in the nature of information technology at informationis passed from one computer to another,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Putting a breake on thatcuts down its usefulness--like putting copy protection on software, whichproved to be counter-productive.&quot;andM;Jim smith, a computer manager at a City merchant bank, is responsible for anewtork of fault-tolerant minis and attached PC workstations.andP;  Despitecomprehensive security measures, his system has twice suffered datacorruption due, he believes, to hackers, possibly within his ownorganization.andP;  &quot;Making hacking illegal would give the company a means todefend itself against the danger to its business,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;A lot ofcompanies like us spend a fortune on security measures, and if they failwe're completely vulnerable.&quot;andM;Evidence suggests that in the majority of cases, firms are reluctant toacknowledge such security breaches, even to the police, for fear of losingthe confidence of their business.andP;  lThis is unlikely to change if hacking ismade illegal.andP;  However, Brian Anxle, information technology executive at theRank Organisation, argues that an example must be made.andM;&quot;If there was a fine of [Br pound] 100 to [Br pound] 200 just for 'curious'hacking, and examples were made of a few cases, it would deter the honesthacker,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;After all, it worked with telephone tapping, we don'thear much about that now.&quot; Some companies without modem links to the outsideworld remain confident that the nearest they will come to hacking is in thepress.andM;On the other hand, we came across staff who requested that they and theirfirms remained anonymous, because they hadn't been affected as yet.andP;  The lastthink they wanted was their unbreached target, and consequently a freshchallenge for PC User-reading hackers.andM;&quot;If damage is caused, even inadvertently, it should be made illegal,&quot; saidRupert Cook, of training company Anthony Cook Associates.andP;  &quot;You could make itillegal in some circumstances, so that it wouldn't be technically illegal ifno damage was caused.&quot;andM;Hackers are currently seen by the media as the electronic equivalent of thecowboy, the spy, the Famous Five and Robin Hood rolled into one.andP;  The imageis one of spotty-faced school kids spending hours in their bedrooms,attempting to make their way into government, defence and scientific researchcomputers for the sheer hell of it.andM;If they can subsequently move into the highly paid world of computer securityconsultancy and rival the earnings of the now defunct wave of teenagemillionaire games programmers, so much the better for the tabloids.andP;  NASA,the Government and so on have red faces, but the public interest hassupposedly been served by identifying loopholes which the Russians might haveused to access military secrets! Yet how dose to reality does this imagereally come? A recent report by the London Business school suggests computerfraud inside companies is a 'Ouch more insidious problem, and that the moneyinvolved runs to over [Br pound]400 million a year, Yet the perpetrators mayappear to be the most loyal employees, working late and resisting attempts tobe moved within the company, in case their schemes are uncovered by theirsuccessors.andM;The survey Suggests that much of the crime is committed by professionalcomputer staff with non computer-literate managers who don't understandwhat's happening until it's too late.andP;  &quot;I used to do a little bit when I wasyounger,&quot; said Cook.andP;  &quot;So many people have the time, and it's one of the feware as where there's any excitement left in die industry.&quot;andM;Another poll recently carried out in a recent trade newspaper confirms thereport.andP;  The confidential survey was carried out amongst DP professionals andfound that over a quarter of those surveyed had hacked at one time oranother: 87 per cent hadn't been caught and in 93 per cent of cases thepolice weren't called.andP;  A quarter of those who admitted hacking were from thebanking and finance sectors of the industry and nine were IT managers.andP;  Yetin die vast majority of cases (83 per cent) no damage was caused, and onlyfour per cent caused damage in excess of [Br pound],10,000.andP;  Most of thesecases involved loss or corruption of data files, or other disruption to work,rather than malicious damage per se.andM;So, is Emma Nicholson's Anti-hacking Bill going to help matters, or make themworse? Nicholson claims that the aim of the bill is to discourage mosthackers and save some of the money being wasted on making securityprovisions, Yet even if hacking were to be made illegal, it's unlikely tostamp it out.andM;Instead, it would eradicate it and might become even more dangerous.andP;  Thelarge number of hackers for whom the activity is a hobby -who don't intend todo any damage but can give institutions valuable insights into die securityof their systems -would no doubt throw in the towel if it became illegal.andO;This would leave the field open to the more daring pranksters, criminals andfraudsters.andP;  Furthermore, given the popular conception of the hacker as ahero, the last bastion of freedom in a world increasingly dominated byorganizations holding massive computer records, it could bring the law intodisrepute,andM;&quot;Fines for hacking would have to be large enough to discourage the honesthacker, but making it illegal wouldn't deter the criminal hacker, or thepsychopathic addict determined to get into the defence computer,&quot; said Anxle.andO;&quot;We feel slightly complacent because we haven't suffered any hacking as yet,but we feel that's because we've implemented sufficient protection, withpasswords at all stages.&quot;andM;Computer installations would still need to spend as much money, if not more,protecting their systems.andP;  In the US, where hacking is illegal, crimes arecurrently taking up to four years to investigate and prosecute.andP;  In mostcases they're only successful if police can extract a confession from thehacker during questioning.andM;At one extreme, Nicholson's proposals would seem to make sense.andP;  In a case inFrance, hackers interfered with a computer monitoring life support systemsleading to the death of the patient.andP;  Such offences would seem to justify themaximum ten year' imprisonment that Nicholson wanted.andP;  In the US, theCongress is considering 15 years.andM;&quot;Making hacking illegal would stop some people from doing it, as data isn'tprotected unless it's illegal,&quot; said Jill Wood, analyst programmer at theYorkshire Building Society.andP;  &quot;Fines should be relative to the amount ofdamage caused, with prison sentences only for serious cases, Eke breakinginto die Ministry of Defence.&quot;andM;Another difficulty is the press coverage of hacking.andP;  The issue has caughtthe public imagination to such an extent, that many cases are blown out ofproportion.andM;For example, the joint Academic Network (JANET) was hacked and the matter wasreported in terms of access having been gained to top secret defenceestablishments.andP;  However, almost anybody could get onto JANET becausepasswords are given out free# to staff and students alike, as it's a publicsystem.andP;  The fact that the Government and research laboratories use it,doesn't impandamp; that their secure computer systems have been penetrated.andP;  Anyimportant or secret information would be stored on separate machines, andwouldn't be available over an academic network.andM;Certainly, it's den that with the turnover rate of systems, programmers andtechnology in the computer industry, the chances of being able to dose everysecurity loophole is small.andP;  The number of operating systems that fad to comeup to the US security standards is a great deal larger than those that do.andO;As systems become more integrated and interconnected, the number of ways forhackers to get in increases accordingly.andM;However, hackers could represent a goldmine, by suggesting ways in which asystem could be breached, thereby enhancing security, as damage could be doneto files, or confidential information passed on to competitors.andP;  As anintellectual pursuit, there are many reasons for encouraging hacking: thecurrent generation of hackers will be the next wave of communicationsspecialists.andM;Information passed between hackers about protocols, operating systems, phonenumbers and passwords is open to abuse, but it also spreads computerexpertise and fosters interest in a vital industry.andP;  &quot;Anything thatencourages creativity, such as hacking, is to be encouraged,&quot; said Soma.andO;&quot;Especially in an industry like ours, where there is so much mindless tedium,encouraging people to in about breaking into a heavily guarded system canonly be positive.&quot;andM;On the other hand, a recent television programme highlighted the activitiesof the Chaos group, who broke into NASA during ale program, and whose motivesmay be seen as having little to do with the public interest, &quot;There areexamples of people going out of their front doors and being hit on the headby a meteorite,&quot; said Soma, &quot;In practice it's impossible to make laws thatcover every eventuality.andP;  I'd like to know what could be done to stop it,even if it were to be outlawed.&quot;andM;The case for legislation against hacking is often based on supposed damagecaused by the activity, either wilfully or unintentionally, while logged ontoa system.andP;  Here, a disunction must be made between hacking and viruses - withthe former often being quite harmless, the latter causing more damage.andO;Should you want to know how gained access, you will find it much harder ifthe act itself is illegal.andP;  They we hardly likely to identify themselveswillingly, or to come back to the scene of their 'crime' for subsequentdetection.andM;A parallel can be made with house-breaking.andP;  If an intruder doesn't do anydamage and leaves without being detected, he can't be prosecuted.andP;  However,the parallel falls short because at the moment there is no value placed oninformation in law.andP;  In cases of theft of software and data, the police canonly press charges for negligible items such as electricity used, or the costof stolen software,andM;This is an area where legislation is obviously required, as information isconstantly gaining a higher value for organizations and individuals.andP;  Yet thebill being drawn up by the Home Office will almost certainly make no changeswhich would give a value to information, as this would mark a major upheavalin legal situadons, not to mention accounting practices.andM;Yet some would argue that a change he would be much more useful than outlawinhacking.andP;  &quot;People entering your system an stealing information is equivalentto the entering your budding and stealing informadon held on paper,&quot; said &quot;Inethic terms it's the same thing, and I think the I should reflect that.&quot;andM;Virus programs, on the other hand, represent a much greater threat becausethey act a low level within the operating system and c cause damage throughside-effects - even ddl intention of their creator was harmless.andP;  virus thatbrought the US academic network a halt last November was supposedly intendedas a security warning, but a bug in the cod stopped 6,000 machines across thecountry.andM;Making it illegal for a hacker to gain entro to a system might make it harderfor them to plant viruses, or cause other damage.andM;What is almost certain, is that some form legislation will soon be introducedwith public backing which outlaws parts, or all, of the activity we now callhacking.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
