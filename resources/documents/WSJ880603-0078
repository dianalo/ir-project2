Now, a half-century later, some Democrats are arguing that they, too, are protecting workers by holding up an increase in the benchmark.    Until recently, labor's effort to increase the minimum wage was expected to easily win approval in a House overwhelmingly controlled by the Democrats, who pride themselves as representing working-class Americans. But it has become mired in an intraparty fight over how to best serve those workers, dealing yet another blow to organized labor's languishing legislative agenda.    A group of moderate and conservative Democrats has teamed up with Republicans to oppose legislation that would raise the minimum wage to $5.05 an hour from $3.35 over four years, saying the increase is too much, too fast. The very workers the increase is intended to benefit would be hurt, they say, as employers cut back workers' hours to offset the increased cost.    &quot;It hurts some of the folks that need the wage increase the most,&quot; says Rep. Timothy Penny (D., Minn.), a junior member of the House Labor Committee.    Rep. Penny's Democratic elders in the House dismiss his arguments, but they have delayed action on the measure for more than a month because they can't muster the votes to pass it. Foes of the bill say that in addition to widespread Republican opposition, there are about 100 Democrats who say they either oppose the measure in its present form or are undecided.    &quot;It's politics,&quot; says Rep. Augustus Hawkins (D., Calif.), chairman of the labor panel. The opponents' real concern, he hints, are employers, not employees: &quot;We have a political year and some members feel that some of their constituents want a slower increase.&quot;    To House Majority Whip Tony Coelho of California, the objections of Rep. Penny and his allies have a familiar ring to them. &quot;That's a Reagan argument on trickledown,&quot; he says. &quot;We hear it all the time.&quot;    The federal floor for hourly wages hasn't been raised since 1981, the longest it has ever remained unchanged. At its present level, the minimum wage fails to meet either of its two traditional targets: It is less than half of the average wage for nonsupervisory workers and it isn't enough to keep a family of three above the federal poverty threshold.    Under legislation approved in March by the House Labor Committee, the wage would rise to $3.85 next year, $4.25 in 1990, $4.65 in 1991 and to $5.05 in 1992. Rep. Penny, who is serving his third term in the House, and his supporters would rather see a slower increase, with the minimum wage rising by no more than $1 an hour over three or four years.    While House Democratic leaders concede that the final figure of $5.05 was set deliberately high in order to give them bargaining room, Rep. Hawkins's suggested compromise of a $1.20 increase over three years is still too steep for opponents. Citing academic studies and anecdotal evidence gathered during committee hearings, Mr. Penny argues that an increase of the magnitude that Rep. Hawkins is seeking would be counterproductive for low-income families.    Although business groups argue that changes in the minimum wage affect teenage workers the most, nearly 60% of workers who are paid at or below that level are between the ages of 20 and 69, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As employers adjust to the higher minimum wage, Rep. Penny says, the impact on older workers will be greater than on teen-agers behind fast-food counters because the older workers have households to support.    &quot;Low-income workers who are working full-time to support their families are likely to see their hours cut back,&quot; Mr. Penny says. &quot;They'd be better off with a smaller increase they could pocket rather than a bigger increase they won't get because they're working fewer hours.&quot;    Mr. Penny says the proposed increase may be acceptable in large, urban areas such as Boston, where the prevailing wage is already more than $5, but is unreasonable for such areas as his rural southeastern Minnesota district.    The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office concluded in March that raising the minimum wage to $5.05-an-hour over four years would result in higher prices for consumers and the loss of nearly 500,000 jobs. (At the request of the House Labor Committee's Democratic staff, the agency four days later released a substitute report that omitted that data, sparking complaints from Republicans that the Democrats were using the office for political ends.)    But Rep. Hawkins dismisses the studies used by opponents of the measure as &quot;phony&quot; and &quot;purely fiction.&quot; He points out that total employment has gone up in all but two of the 15 years in which the minimum wage has been increased.    While he concedes that some marginal workers may lose their jobs or find their hours reduced as a result of the increase, Rep. Hawkins argues that even more workers will benefit as employers raise other wages in order to maintain the cushion between the minimum wage and those paid workers higher up on the pay scale. &quot;You have to look at the net improvement,&quot; he says. &quot;There will be more gainers than losers.&quot;    Rep. Hawkins also argues that the proposed increase does nothing more than restore some of the value the minimum wage has lost to inflation. If the $3.35-an-hour level that was put in place in 1981 had kept up with the government's Consumer Price Index, the minimum wage would now be $4.51.    House Democratic leaders are tinkering with the minimum-wage measure, hoping to find a formula that will attract enough votes to salvage hopes for enactment. But they say that before they schedule a House vote, they want assurances that the Senate will act on the bill. The Senate Labor Committee hasn't yet considered minimumwage legislation and, with only a few months left in the current congressional session, the bill could die from inaction.    When the Democrats regained control of the Senate last year, organized labor unveiled an ambitious agenda of legislation. But only one piece -- a bill to ban most uses of polygraphs by private employers -- has been approved by the Senate and appears certain to be enacted into law.    ---                 Who Earns the Minimum Wage?
