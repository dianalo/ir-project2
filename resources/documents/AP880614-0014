Lawmakers concede that election-year politics probably willdelay action until 1989. But during a hearing on Monday intoalleged FBI abuses in an investigation of anti-Reaganadministration activists, members of the House Judiciarysubcommittee on civil and constitutional rights agreed withwitnesses who recommended new controls on such investigations.   FBI officials have said an internal investigation of theoperation found several problems with it, and The New York Timesreported today that an internal FBI report recommends disciplinaryaction against some of those involved.   FBI spokesman Milt Ahlerich would not comment on the contents ofthe report and said that FBI Director William Sessions had made nodecision on its recommendations.   The FBI conducted much of its probe of the Committee inSolidarity with the People of El Salvador, a U.S. group opposed toReagan administration policies in Central America, under guidelinesthat are supposed to cover investigations of internationalterrorism.   Using those guidelines allowed the bureau to conduct widespreadsurveillance of political rallies and individuals including nuns,union officials and college professors opposed to administrationpolicy.   Witnesses and lawmakers at Monday's hearing said there should bejust one set of guidelines instead of the current two _ domesticand international _ governing such investigations.   The standard, witnesses agreed, should specify that the FBI lookfor criminal actions and steer clear of a group's politicalactivity.   Lawmakers and witnesses also agreed that the standard should bewritten into law instead of left to the attorney general todetermine.   ``What we've tried to do in the past is rely on the Constitutionfor protecting individual rights,'' said Rep. Don Edwards,D-Calif., chairman of the House panel. ``I am thinking seriously ofsometime early next year taking another quick look at this issueand writing the beginnings of an FBI charter.''   The FBI justified its use of the international terrorism probeguidelines in the CISPES investigation by citing an informant'sclaim that some of the group's members were giving money andsupplies to a leftist group in El Salvador.   But no criminal charges were ever filed against CISPES or any ofits members, and the investigation was closed in June 1985.   One witness at Monday's hearing, Morton Halperin, director ofthe Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union, saidthe current guidelines ``accommodate the demands of law enforcementwithout fully protecting the lawful exercise of our constitutionalrights.''   Halperin said the FBI's investigation of CISPES ``demonstratesthat the current FBI guidelines have failed to protect Americansfrom improper government surveillance.''   According to FBI documents released in January and comments byFBI officials since then, the bureau's initial probe of CISPESbegan in September 1981 as an investigation into alleged criminalviolations of domestic security laws.   That investigation was closed the following February. But inMarch 1983, the FBI began a new investigation of CISPES under thebroader guidelines governing international terrorism. Although muchof those guidelines are classified, it is known that they give theFBI far more sweeping authority to investigate U.S. citizens thanthe domestic guidelines do.   Eric Richard, a former Justice Department aide, told the panelthat when the international terrorism guidelines were written, ``itmay not have been fully realized how frequently the groups thatwould be the targets of such investigations would be composedprimarily of American citizens.''   John E. Finn, an assistant professor of government at WesleyanUniversity, disagreed with Halperin's contention that the FBIviolated the First Amendment rights of CISPES members by attendingCISPES meetings, obtaining the group's literature and recording thelicense plate numbers of cars parked outside CISPES meetings.   But all of the witnesses, including Finn, agreed that the FBIwould not have been able to mount such an extensive domesticsurveillance campaign had it been limited to looking for actualcriminal violations.   ``Widescale monitoring of public events served no apparentpurpose toward achieving the FBI's stated objective. A frontorganization ... is not going to reveal its hidden agenda in itspublic activities,'' Halperin said.   ``The domestic security guidelines require a criminal link,''Richard said, adding that those rules have worked well ``inbalancing civil liberties, intelligence and law enforcementconcerns.''   The witnesses also said that an FBI statute should require thatinvestigations of suspected terrorists in the United States bereviewed frequently by top FBI and Justice Department officials toensure that there is sufficient evidence to continue.</TEXT></DOC>
