Recently, time has hung heavily on the hands of many traders who speculate on mergers and restructurings. There haven't been many multibillion-dollar deals in 1987, and corporate transactions of all kinds have dwindled since the frenzied deal-making of late 1986. But some stalwart arbitragers are still in business, still willing to take risks and still making a buck.    While there are fewer deals, there are some attractive opportunities because fewer dollars are chasing the deals, traders say. In the wake of the insider-trading scandals, Ivan Boesky's big arbitrage fund is being liquidated and arbitrage activity has been declining at such firms as Kidder Peabody and Merrill Lynch.    Alan Greenberg, chairman of Bear Stearns, sees better opportunities for profit in risk arbitrage now that some players are retreating. &quot;We're putting more emphasis on it,&quot; he says. Some small arbitrage firms are adding new clients as larger players retreat.    Currently, analysts say, some pending transactions offer unusually big rewards. Carter Hawley Hale's restructuring package is worth about $62 a share, says Robert Raiff of C.J. Lawrence; the stock closed yesterday at only 54. Some analysts believe Piedmont Aviation, currently the target of a bidding war, could be bought for as much as $75 a share; the stock closed yesterday at 69 5/8.    By contrast, during the heyday of takeover speculation last fall, shares of companies such as CPC International and Gillette were bid up -- mostly on rumors alone -- above the level of any reasonable takeover offer, analysts say.    To the delight of many arbs, the pace of new deals -- at least medium-sized ones -- seems to have picked up in recent days. Many companies have cash or high-priced stock and are seeking acquisitions, and there are big pools of money available for leveraged buyouts, traders note.    This week alone, Viacom International had a new offer from Arsenal Holdings; Rainier Bancorp. agreed to be acquired by Security Pacific after getting two bids; Taft Broadcasting was reported to be mulling more restructuring measures; and separate buyers said they wanted to acquire Harnischfeger Industries and Sorg Inc.    In addition, some arbs say many companies are good bets because they seem to be &quot;in play.&quot; Some favorites: Lomas andamp; Nettleton, Borg-Warner, A.H. Robins and even Gillette. Lucky Stores could get another bid from Asher Edelman, traders say.    Using more traditional investment criteria, Ron Baron of Baron Capital likes Time Inc. and Stop andamp; Shop, long-rumored takeover candidates that have been taking steps to boost their stock prices by improving their profitability.    There usually isn't much money to be made from the safest arbitrage transactions. Many arbs have been unnerved by the general atmosphere of scandal and by losses suffered in 1986 on shares of USX Corp., Gillette, CPC and others where a transaction didn't materialize. So they're bidding for safer deals where there's a firm bid for a company and relatively assured financing. While spreads on safe deals widened briefly after the Boesky scandal, they quickly tightened again, traders say.    An investor who bought Owens-Illinois Feb. 11 -- the day after it consented to go private with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts -- would earn an annualized 22% return through the deal's closing next month at the agreed upon price, according to arbitragers at Oppenheimer. The investor would have made 23% by buying Southwest Forest Industries Feb. 11, about two weeks after it agreed to merge with Stone Container.    Traders see big opportunities in buying stocks on early indications that the company might be acquired or restructure. Because inside information has become scarcer, takeover stocks now tend to soar after -- as well as before -- an official indication that something is happening.    When Norfolk Southern said it might buy Piedmont, the airline's stock jumped 8 3/4 to 58 1/4 in anticipation of the bidding war that soon developed. Cyclops Corp. was trading in the 60s in January, when it said it would evaluate restructuring plans. It recently accepted an acquisition offer of $90.25 a share from Dixons Group PLC, which topped earlier bids from Audio/Video Affiliates.    &quot;The big money in arbitrage today is where it always was,&quot; says one arb, &quot;where there's a bidding war.&quot;    Some traders still bet on rumors. Friday, Rainier rose 3 1/4 to 42 1/4, apparently on leaks of impending bids. Monday, however, after Rainier said it was weighing two offers, the stock gained another 5 1/4 points, to 47 1/2. It closed yesterday at 46 5/8, off 7/8.    Of course, the game isn't called risk arbitrage for nothing. Many arbs held Cyclops for about a year but sold it before a bid emerged. Recently, A.H. Robins and Pan Am shares dived after their potential suitors withdrew. Traders say many speculative stocks might plunge if more scandals force firms to cut back their arbitrage positions.    But the business seems to be recovering some of its earlier rationality. It's getting back to &quot;classic arbitrage,&quot; says one arb. &quot;Somebody makes a bid or proposes a bid and then you decide whether the values are there.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
