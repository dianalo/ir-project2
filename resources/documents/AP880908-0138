Simon is expected to try to push legislation through Congress tosettle the dispute before the evening rush hour Friday.   Members of the United Transportation Union planned to walk outat 12:01 a.m. Friday when a 36-day cooling-off period ended, butcompromised in exchange for a promise from the railroad to delaylayoffs that were to occur on Friday.   The railroad and the union are bickering over the size of traincrews. Candamp;NW wants to dump 1,150 brakemen whose jobs it says areobsolete; the union believes the jobs are necessary to maintainsafety.   Candamp;NW spokesman James Foote said that in delaying the layoffs,the railroad ``preserves the commuter rush here in Chicago andavoids the disruption that would come from a strike at midnight.''   Talks between the company and the union broke off late Wednesdayand were scheduled to resume today, said Mike Bushman, a spokesmanfor U.S. Rep. Terry Bruce, D-Ill.   Foote said Wednesday that the company and the union were ``stillquite a ways apart.''   ``Because of the positions of the two parties, we're putting ourstrike plans in effect,'' Foote said.   The Candamp;NW recalled about 8,000 replacement workers and mobilizedmanagement personnel in anticipation of a strike against its10-state Midwest freight system, Foote said.   The UTU went on strike against Candamp;NW for four hours Aug. 4 afteran earlier cooling-off period imposed by President Reagan. Congressended that walkout by imposing a second cooling-off period.   While the dispute involves Candamp;NW's freight operations, a strikewould shut down the railroad's commuter service, forcing anestimated 41,000 people from Chicago's suburbs to find some wayelse to get to work.   Officials at Metra, a suburban commuter rail service thatpurchases service from Candamp;NW, said a strike would cripple serviceand cause rush-hour chaos.</TEXT></DOC>
