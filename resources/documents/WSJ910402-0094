Banning billboards on scenic highways isone thing, but banning them on all rural highways and onroadsides in squalid inner cities is just another elitistattack on property rights.   Sen. John Chafee (R., R.I.) and co-sponsors have proposedthe Visual Pollution Control Act to ban all new billboardsalong federally subsidized highways and to let state andlocal governments condemn existing billboards withoutcompensating owners. The Bush administration has proposedbanning all new billboards on rural interstates and majorhighways (90% of the 304,000 miles of the nation's federallyfunded highways). Forty-four environmental groups have jumpedon the scenic-purity bandwagon.</LP><TEXT>   According to Sen. Chafee, &quot;Billboards provide very littleinformation to the motoring public.&quot; Perhaps not to those whomotor through the country with their Michelin travel guidesand Hyatt reservations. But a study by Houston travelconsultants concluded that billboards influence the decisionsof 71% of budget and economy hotel customers. In Florida, 90%of the state's 27,000 billboards carry messages abouttourist-related activities.   Scenic America, an anti-billboard lobby, says billboardsare &quot;litter on a stick,&quot; &quot;blight our neighborhoods anddegrade our landscape&quot; and constitute a &quot;visual assault&quot; oninnocent Americans. Some environmentalists talk as if drivingthrough an area should convey a right of ownership andcontrol over everything the driver sees. The more freedom ofmovement private automobiles have given people, the moreintolerant some people have become of how other people usetheir private property.   Much of the roadside land used for billboards has littlevalue for other uses. People living next to an interstate areobliged to listen to 18-wheelers thundering by 24 hours a day-- yet are routinely prohibited from profiting from thenuisance. Many of the environmentalists who demand thenullification of roadside residents' property rights wouldfight to the death any proposal to put a major highwaythrough their own neighborhoods.   Federal billboard policy has long been an archenemy toproperty rights. In 1958, the federal government beganoffering bonus payments to states that agreed to ban orrestrict billboards; most states rejected the program. In1965, President Johnson commanded states to &quot;beautify orelse]&quot; with the Highway Beautification Act. (Remember LadyBird's campaign?) States that did not ban billboards alongfederally financed highways (except in business or industrialareas) faced sharp reductions in federal highway trust fundallocations.   The 1965 act banned billboards within 660 feet of ruralfederally funded highways. Naturally, businesses beganputting up larger signs outside the 660-foot limit. In 1974,Congress vastly extended controls by banning billboardswithin the &quot;limit of vision&quot; from roadways -- effectivelycommandeering the use of land for as far as the eye couldsee.   Some highway officials have invoked the beautification actto harass roadside residents. The American Farm Bureaucomplained in 1979 that highway officials told &quot;farmers thatthey cannot have their own farm machinery and equipmentparked in sight of a highway and that it must be stored insheds or barns.&quot; Other farmers were commanded to move theirfuel storage tanks away from the highway side of theirfarmhouses &quot;so as not to be unsightly to highway users.&quot;   Under the Highway Beautification Act, the federal, stateand local governments have paid billboard companies as muchas $200,000 to remove a single billboard. TransportationDepartment Inspector General Joseph Welsch complained in 1985that the money given to billboard owners to remove signs&quot;could be used to erect new signs&quot; in other places. But nocompensation has been paid to the vast majority of landownersdenied the use of their land aside federal highways.   And while the government lavishly compensated companiesfor removing some billboards, the Federal HighwayAdministration from 1977 to 1990 approved letting companieschainsaw hundreds of thousands of trees on public land alonghighways to improve the visibility of remaining billboards.Many of these trees had been planted with federal highwaybeautification funds. Though the Federal HighwayAdministration has reversed its policy, some states stillallow the clear-cutting of trees on public land alongfederally funded highways.   The federal government bans rural billboards at the sametime it injects billions of dollars each year into ruraleconomic development. This is a Soviet-style strategy, withcentral planners doling out the capital while hobbling theability of many aid recipients to advertise and survive.According to the Outdoor Advertising Association of America,64% of the advertisers on billboards are local retailmerchants -- small businessmen who often cannot affordalternative means of advertising.   While the Transportation Department's Federal HighwayAdministration now appears staunchly anti-billboard, theTransportation Department's National Highway Traffic SafetyAdministration recently requested vast amounts of freebillboard space from the advertising industry for its latest&quot;buckle up&quot; campaign. The Sierra Club and the Izaak WaltonLeague endorsed Sen. Chafee's anti-billboard initiative --even though they recently accepted free billboard ad space.Maine bans all billboards -- but advertises its touristattractions on billboards in Massachusetts.   There was another federal beautifying program launched in1965 -- the National Endowment for the Arts. Currently, thereare far stricter &quot;aesthetic&quot; controls on how property ownersmay use their land along federal highways than on how artistsmay use the tax dollars the NEA doles out to them. MostAmericans likely find billboards less useless or offensivethan NEA-financed abstract art or bean-sprout abuse.   Congress should not further sacrifice the property rightsof hundreds of thousands of Americans in order to protect afew overly sensitive Volvo drivers from inadvertentlywitnessing ads for Motel 6.   ---   Mr. Bovard is an associate analyst for the Cato Institute.</TEXT></DOC>
