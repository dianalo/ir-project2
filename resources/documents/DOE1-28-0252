The socioeconomicimpacts identified as relevant to the plant were assessed in detail,including potential economic-demographic, public-service and fiscal,ocean-use, aesthetic, cultural, and energy impacts. The economic-demographicimpact assessment does not estimate the full extent of population andincome changes or second-order effects associated with the plant. Thereis no subjective assessment of perceptions on the part of local communitiesconcerning probable changes in land values, housing, and population.Anticipated public-service and fiscal impacts are found to be relativelyunimportant; however, the measurement of the impact of the plant on taxrevenues needs improvement. The assessment does not sufficiently considerthe objective and subjective assessment of ocean-use, aesthetic, andcultural impacts, which are of major significance to the local communities.The quantification of physical impacts, perceptions of impacts, and potentialmitigation measures is inadequate. The energy impacts need to be updatedto reflect the recent declines in oil prices and price projections. Anassessment of low-probability, high-risk occurrences may be necessary.12 refs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
