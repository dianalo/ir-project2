Considering the lossless conversion of electric energy intoheat it becomes evident that compared with fossil-fuel central heatingsystems electric heating systems can manage with two thirds or half ofthe end use energy. Several studies have impressingly proved this tobe true. The advantages of electric heating systems are also attractiveas regards pollution abatement. The controversial discussion of 1986more and more shows electric resistance heating systems to be causingless emissions and environmental effects than oil-fired central heatingsystems. An additional advantage consists in the fact that electric powergeneration has been banished from the densely populated areas. Electricpower as a matter of fact activates domestic energy reserves which wouldgo to waste otherwise. Space heating uses do therefore add to our energybasis. Electric power adapts to the respective demands and stimulatesa conservation-minded use of energy. Compared with conventional oil-firedheating systems electric power causes less emissions and therefore reducesthe environmental load.</TEXT></DOC>
