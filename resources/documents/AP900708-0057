(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Education Associationsoundly defeated all challenges to its abortion rights position asit concluded a four-day convention Sunday.   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos sent his ``warmest greetings''to the convention and pledged to work closely with the union toimprove schools. The message seemed to signal an end to a feudbetween the NEA and the Education Department that began during theReagan administration when the department was led by the outspokenWilliam Bennett, now drug czar.   Although reluctant to use the word ``abortion,'' a majority ofthe 8,100 delegates Sunday defeated an attempt to change theunion's support of family planning, ``including the right toreproductive freedom.''   The nation's largest teachers' union also voted to oppose anylegislation that erodes the Supreme Court's abortion ruling ortries to impede access to information on ``choice of reproductivehealth care options.''   ``Whether you or I agree with abortion is irrelevant,'' saidRobert Chase, a vice president of the nation's largest teachers'union, during floor debate. ``What is relevant is the right ofwomen to make the choice for themselves.''   Robert Pawson, head of Teachers Saving Children, vowed tocontinue attempts to ``reform the NEA from within.''   Pawson said abortion opponents for the first time in 10 yearshad been able to get NEA delegates to act on the issue. In thepast, he said abortion rights advocates had prevented debate on theissue.   In the daylong session, Kathleen Holzmeister of the IllinoisEducation Association lost an effort to forbid abortion counselingat community-operated, school-based family planning clinics.   On Saturday, delegates easily defeated an attempt to stop theunion's policy of lobbying for abortion rights.   Christine Nowak of New York led efforts to eliminate abortionlobbying from the legislative agenda of the nation's largestteachers' union. She and others argued that union dues should notbe used for such activity because the NEA's 2 million members havea variety of views on the issue.   In a resounding voice vote, the legislative amendment wasrejected.   In other action, the union put itself on record in support ofgiving teachers more authority over their jobs and schoolcurriculums _ popularly called site-based decision-making.   The NEA also agreed to write President Bush and Congress insupport of sanctions against South Africa until apartheid iseliminated, and to encourage pension funds' divestment of companiesdoing business in South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
