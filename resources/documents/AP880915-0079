(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Patrick Kennedy, the 21-year-old son ofSen. Edward M. Kennedy, has become the latest member of his famousfamily to win public office, soundly defeating an incumbent in aDemocratic primary for Legislature.   In a Democratic primary for governor Wednesday, businessmanBruce G. Sundlun won the right to oppose Republican Gov. Edward D.DiPrete in November. In a congressional race, Democratic Rep.Fernand St Germain held off a strong challenge.   Kennedy, a junior at Providence College, beat five-term Rep.John Skeffington 1,324 votes, or 57 percent, to Skeffington's 1,009votes, or 43 percent. Kennedy wins the office because there is noRepublican opposition in November.   ``They told me to wait my turn. Well, tonight it's our turn ...for representation that listens to the needs of the people and notthe demands of the party bosses,'' Kennedy told a cheering crowd ashis father and other family members looked on.   Retorted Skeffington, ``I thought they were the party bosses.''   Kennedy called his father in for a fund-raiser and repeatedlychallenged the voter registrations of Skeffington supporters. OnWednesday, the Massachusetts senator posed with voters for picturesoutside a polling place.   ``I'm not nervous,'' the senator said. ``I'm proud of him. Hehas worked hard. He'll do a good job.''   Skeffington, who was endorsed by much of the local Democraticleadership, questioned whether Kennedy was committed to the areaand suggested he was trying to use the race as a stepping stone toCongress.   Skeffington said he was certain why he lost. ``Naturally, it wasthe Kennedy name. The Kennedy family came out in full force,'' hesaid.   St Germain held off a challenge from political consultant ScottWolf, who hoped to capitalize on discontent in the district andrecent ethics probes of the House Banking Committee chairman. Withall precincts reporting, St Germain had 26,185 votes, or 55percent, to Wolf's 21,422, or 45 percent.   St Germain, who has served 14 terms in the House, refused todebate and managed his own campaign, driving throughout thedistrict on the state's east side in one of his beat-up cars.   In the gubernatorial primary, Sundlun, a communicationsexecutive, overwhelmed home-education activist Peter Van Daam tooppose DiPrete, who seeks a third, two-year term. With allprecincts reporting, Sundlun had 66,231 votes, or 90 percent, toVan Daam's 7,221, or 10 percent.   DiPrete heads toward November defending himself againstallegations that members of his administration were allowed tointervene in land deals involving DiPrete's sons. The governor, whois campaigning on a theme of improving Rhode Island's economy, hasdenied the allegations.</TEXT></DOC>
