The charging letter asserts that Respondent violatedthe Export Administration Act of 1979 (``the Act'') and andSection;andSection;387.3, 387.4, 387.5 and 387.6 of the Export Administration Regulations(``the Regulations'').\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Act was reauthorized and amended by the Export AdministrationAmendments Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-64, 99 Stat. 120, (July 12, 1985), andamended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-418,102 Stat. 1107 (August 23, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28">The Regulations, formerly codified at 15 CFR Parts 368-399, </ITAG><T3>were </T3>redesignated as 15 CFR Parts 768-799, effective October 1,1988 (53 FR 37751, September 28, 1988).Respondent filed an answer to the charging letter which was received inthis office on October 12, 1988. Pursuant to andSection; 788.14 of the Regulations,this matter is adjudicated on the record without a hearing. Both AgencyCounsel and Respondent made written submissions to the record, which closedfor decision on December 30, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>This is but one of a half dozen or so separate cases in which the Agencyasserts there was a scheme to divert U.S. technology to the U.S.S.R. Itis represented that a conspiracy existed among various individuals andwas directed by one Goran Josberg, individually and doing business as GlobeMetals, Globe Trade, and Globe Computers. Josberg is represented to havebeen a denied person since 1983.\2\<NOTE/> It is asserted that his <T3>modus operandi </T3>has been to use other willing partners such asKeck, and Anton Elzer \3\<NOTE/> to obtain goods for Josberg's Soviet customers and to engagein cover-up schemes to hide the transactions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ This Denial Order was published in 49 FR 499 (January4, 1984). The proceeding involving Mr. Josberg is currently awaiting Secretarialaction. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>Elzer, et al., </T3>Docket Nos. 7108-01, 7108-02, Decision, June 23,1988 (53 FR 26676, July 29, 1988). <ITAG tagnum="84">Facts </ITAG>The evidence reflects that Respondent Keck participated in a conspiracywith Elzer, individually and doing business as Development and ConsultantElzer ECO AB, and Josberg to order a U.S.-origin WAS 3000 airstream modulator(WAS 3000), and attempted to conceal, by a paper diversion through Singapore,transshipment of this equipment through Finland for ultimate reexport tothe U.S.S.R. The crux of the conspiracy was that working together, theyobtained a U.S.-origin high intensity WAS 3000 system based on the representationthat Respondent Keck was the end user and that West Germany was the ultimatecountry of destination, when in fact the goods were acquired for ultimateshipment to the Soviet Union. Elzer made inquiries of U.S. manufacturers regarding the ordering of theequipment for Josberg in 1984 (Agency Exh. 2). After declining to completethe ITA-629P form, providing information about the ultimate end user, asrequired by the Regulations and requested by the U.S. manufacturer, Elzerand Josberg did not order the equipment (Agency Exh. 2). Elzer then requested Keck to obtain the WAS-3000. Respondent Keck thereafterworked with Elzer and his company to order and make arrangements for theexport and reexport to Finland. Respondent Keck supplied the U.S. exporterwith West German Import certificate number 728167, dated May 24, 1984,and applied for an export license, which was thereafter granted, with Keckidentified as the end user in West Germany. The equipment was shipped from the United States to West Germany on orabout October 12, 1984. The day after it was received, Respondent deliveredthe equipment to Elzer who, in furtherance of the conspiracy and arrangementspreviously made, caused the WAS-3000 to be forwarded from Hamburg, WestGermany to Nurminen Oy, a freight forwarder in Helsinki, Finland. Uponarrival in Helsinki, the equipment was transshipped to Moscow. Elzer, in a written statement to the Agency, asserted that the WAS-3000was acquired from Keck and delivered to Josberg:<ITAG tagnum="21">[Mr] Keck offered me the goods without any restrictions. We have nosuch [export control] regulations herein that [West] Germany he explained.Thus, I ordered in the name of Allison, who had got an order from Josberg,one WAS-3000. <T3>Mr. Keck </T3>made all the arrangements with the U.S. exporter aloneand when the goods arrived in Hamburg, Mr. Josberg ordered me to send theequipment to messrs., Nurminen in Finland. <T3>I instructed Mr. Keck about this and he made all necessary arrangements. . . to Finland.</T3></ITAG>(Agency Exh. 2) (emphasis added). It is clear that reexport authority to the Soviet Union for the WAS-3000would have been denied if requested. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>A former employee of Josberg, Lennert Appelberg, told the Department ofCommerce Export control attache, at meetings on April 24, 1985 and aboutMay 3, 1985, that he was a ``front'' man for Josberg. According to Appelberg,Josberg often traveled to the U.S.S.R. and negotiated with the Sovietsfor delivery of desired U.S. technology, Appelberg's duties were to acquirethe U.S. technology for Josberg and Globe Metals for diversion to the EastBloc. Appelberg stated that Josberg bragged openly about the fact thathe was able to divert large quantities of U.S. technology through Swedenand other countries since 1982 or 1983, even though he was on the tableof denied parties.Another employee of Josberg, Rolf Carrick, provided specific example ofhow Josberg operated. According to Carrick, Appelberg bought a computerfor Josberg, for ultimate sale to Josberg's Soviet customer. Josberg thenpaid a Swedish lawyer a fee to answer inquiries on the end use of the computer,to the effect that he intended to use it for word-processing, when thelawyer had no intention to buy the computer at all. Thus, while Josbergdirected which goods to buy for his Soviet customers, he remained behindthe scene, the evidence shows that Elzer knowingly played the same kindof role as Appelberg and the lawyer in Sweden, by obtaining the WAS-3000for Josberg's Soviet cutsomer, while Josberg directed the operation fromthe shadows.\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The facts and discussion relating to this ``second transaction''are from the proceeding regarding Anton Elzer, cited above. They deal withthis transaction also and those remarks are adopted here. The record here reflects that Keck represented himself to be the ultimateend user when he had already arranged for disposition of the WAS-3000 equipmentto Elzer and his company, Allison Ltd., of Singapore. He also representedthe WAS-3000 would remain in West Germany. Keck, Elzer and others knewof, and made the arrangements for, the shipment of the WAS-3000 from WestGermany to Finland the day following its delivery in West Germany. Respondent Keck's tardily filed explanation does not contradict the essentialfacts as related above, although he would place a different emphasis reducingthe extent of his advertent participation. It is acknowledged that he wasused. However, I conclude that he was not as innocent as he now claims.He was aware of the illegal diversion scheme before the goods were transshippedto the Soviet Union. He could have blown the whistle then, but he didn't.It is represented by Keck that he did not know Josberg and did not knowthat the WAS-3000 was to be shipped to the Soviet Union. These elementsneed not be proved in order to find the Respondent liable for the violations.Keck did not have to know all of the members of the conspiracy, nor didhe have to know that the ultimate destinations of the U.S. origin equipmentwas the Soviet Union. His knowledge that the equipment was going to beexported, in violation of the regulations, and his actions in furtheranceof this, in particular, his false and misleading representations to theU.S. export officials, makes him an active and liable co-conspirator. Theactions of his co-conspirators, Elzer and Josberg, in reexporting the equipmentto the Soviet Union, are thereby attributable to him. The sum total of the evidence, and the inferences drawn, clearly demonstratean illegal conspiracy in which this Respondent and others played activeroles. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>Based on the evidence in this record I find that Keck conspired with othersto acquire a U.S.-origin WAS-3000 airstream modulator on a false representationthat West Germany was the country of ultimate destination. He and others,in fulfillment of the conspiracy and previous arrangements, then reexportedthe equipment through Finland to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics(USSR) without the required reexport authorizations from the U.S. Departmentof Commerce. Each and all of the facts set forth and charging letter of May 16, 1988have been established and found as have the violations of the regulationsalleged. Based upon such findings, I conclude that an Order denying RespondentsU.S. export privileges for a period of ten years from the date a finalOrder becomes effective should be entered in this proceeding.\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ I do not concur with Agency Counsel's request that theperiod of denial should be 20 years. I do not find that this Respondent'sparticipation was as egregious as that of the other conspirators. His criminalconviction and fine have also been considered, both with respect to hisculpability and the appropriate penalty. <ITAG tagnum="84">Order </ITAG>I.
