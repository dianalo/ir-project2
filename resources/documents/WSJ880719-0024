In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group said it holds 1,974,456 Apache common, including open-market purchases of 356,600 shares from April 12 to last Wednesday for prices ranging from $7.33 to $8.50 each. The group also said on July 5 in a private transaction it purchased 980,256 shares from Apache Petroleum L.P. for $8.13 each.    According to the filing, the group acquired its Apache stock for investment purposes and not for the purposes of seeking control of the company or influencing its management. However, it said it may purchase additional shares and didn't rule out changing its intentions.    An Apache spokeswoman said the Denver-based oil and gas company understands that the purchase was for investment purposes and there aren't any plans for Morris D. Jaffe of Jaffe Energy to become a board member.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Apache's shares closed unchanged at $7.375. </TEXT></DOC>
