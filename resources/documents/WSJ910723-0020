A U.S. Agriculture Departmentcrop-condition report released after trading yesterday showedthat corn in the heart of Midwest is beginning todeteriorate. The price of the corn contract for Decemberdelivery rose 8 1/2 cents, to $2.40 a bushel.   What's more, meteorologists said, little rain is in theforecast. &quot;There's a front going through now that's raisedsome expectations, but I think it's going to be adisappointment for most of these areas,&quot; said Peter Leavitt,executive vice president of WeatherServices Corp., Bedford,Mass. The front will bring cooler temperatures -- but littlerain -- to the Midwest, he added.   The corn crop in Iowa and Illinois is particularlyvulnerable now because pollination, the process that formsindividual kernels of corn, isn't yet complete in thoseareas. During pollination, strands of silk extending fromcorn ears transmit pollen into the ears to produce kernels.Excessive dryness can sterilize the silk or interfere withthe transmission of pollen.   Even after this process is complete, corn will remainextremely weather-sensitive throughout July and early August.As a result, grain futures prices are likely to be volatile,driven mainly by weather. The combination of yesterday's USDAcrop report and the poor prognosis for rain are expected topush grain futures prices higher again today.   The soybean crop, though more resilient than corn at thistime of year, also needs moisture, analysts said. Within thenext week or two, soybean plants will begin to grow pods thateventually will become soybeans. The plants will becomeprogressively more vulnerable to the dry weather if itcontinues into August.   The price of the soybean contract for November deliveryclimbed 14 cents yesterday, to $5.40 a bushel. Largely insympathy with corn and soybean prices, the price of theDecember wheat contract rose 6 3/4 cents to $2.9225 a bushel.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices fell in heavy trading onthe New York Mercantile Exchange, hit hard by PresidentBush's comments that he doesn't expect allied troops tore-enter Iraq and by reports that Iraq may soon be allowed tosell oil on a one-shot basis to buy food. The Iraqi newscombined with the expiration of the August contract to trimcrude oil 44 cents a barrel to $21.72. The September contractsettled at $21.87 a barrel, off 30 cents.   President Bush's comments came over the weekend before heleft Turkey. Petroleum futures prices had been buoyed inrecent sessions by widespread speculation that U.S.-ledforces might renew military action against Iraq. Separately,the United Nations Persian Gulf human rights envoy againappealed to the U.N. to let Iraq sell $1 billion of crudeoil. Although officials had no comment, some oil marketparticipants said rumors suggesting the U.S. and Britainwould approve such a sale roiled trading.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices fell. Gold for Augustdelivery ended $3.10 an ounce lower at $368.10. Septembersilver fell 6.3 cents an ounce to $4.357. William O'Neill,futures strategist at Merrill Lynch, said the firm dollar andweakness in oil prices reduced inflation concerns and therebyput pressure on precious metals. Prices fell below a fewmajor technical levels, which triggered additional selling,he added, although prices remained within their recenttrading ranges. Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader at ChaseManhattan Bank, viewed the move as largely technical,triggered by gold's failure again to rise above $370. Therewas a small amount of selling in a thin market, he said. Butif gold prices fall much further, he added, a fresh wave ofselling could follow.                                                                                                          COTTON: Futures prices rose in light volume. Rain in theRio Grande Valley in Texas continues to raise concerns aboutthe cotton currently being harvested in the area, said SharonJohnson, cotton specialist at Cargill Investor Services.Kevin McDermott, vice president of economic research atCalcot Ltd., a cotton cooperative in California and Arizona,said the outlook for cotton over the next few months looksfavorable: Mill consumption in the U.S. is expected to bevery strong, and concerns are arising that recent massivefloods in China may have damaged the crop in that country.Cotton for October delivery traded as high as 71.05 cents apound but ended at 70.67, up 0.54 cent a pound.</TEXT></DOC>
