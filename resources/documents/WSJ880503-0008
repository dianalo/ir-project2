Beset with internal divisions, OPEC failed early Monday to form a response to a call for a joint production-cutting effort initiated by several non-OPEC members. But in hopes of keeping the historic proposal alive, OPEC immediately renewed contact with nonmember nations.    Still, the cartel's failure to agree on a plan to cut output sent oil prices on both the spot and futures markets plunging. In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, for instance, the bellwether West Texas Intermediate crude, for June delivery, declined 85 cents a barrel to $17.14, after dipping as low at $17.10.    But the Dow Jones Transportation Average jumped 11.79 to 853.79 as airline and trucking issues responded favorably to the oil-price decline.    Among the nations renewing overtures toward a possible alliance yesterday were Mexico, a leader of the non-OPEC group, and Venezuela, which had led the fight within the cartel to respond to the non-OPEC offer with an agreement to cut production jointly.    &quot;The spirit of the conference was to keep the dialogue with non-OPEC alive,&quot; said Fernando Santos-Alvite, Ecuador's oil minister, in an interview following OPEC's divisive four-day meeting here. The non-OPEC members, he noted, proposed cutting production only during May and June. &quot;We're interested on a longer-term basis,&quot; Mr. Santos said.    OPEC ministers sloughed off the severe and instantaneous reaction of the oil markets. &quot;We cannot be governed in our thinking by the spot market on day 'x' or day 'y,'&quot; said Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister. &quot;Our concern was not what happens on (the New York Merc) Monday or Tuesday, but what happens to prices over the medium term.&quot;    Hisham M. Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, also asserted that despite the divisions within OPEC, on one issue the 13 ministers became united. &quot;There is now unanimous recognition within OPEC,&quot; he said, &quot;that OPEC alone cannot balance the market.&quot;    But as the oil ministers prepared to leave Vienna until June 8, when they will resume deliberations on the joint production-cutting effort, it became clear that Persian Gulf politics -- not economics -- most fostered the inconclusive outcome of the meeting.    In fact, it was Saudi Arabia that blocked formulation of a counter-offer by OPEC to the eight non-OPEC producers' proposal to cut their exports by 5%, if the cartel would do so by the same percentage.    In the wake of the Saudi intransigence, the OPEC ministers abruptly concluded their meeting in the wee hours of Monday morning, postponing any possible action until their regular conference June 8.    The non-OPEC members had agreed to cut their production by 183,000 barrels a day if OPEC cut its output by 700,000 barrels a day-an equal amount in percentage terms. A majority of eight OPEC members was ready to back a counteroffer under which OPEC would have cut production by 300,000 barrels a day.    But four Persian Gulf members led by Saudi Arabia disagreed, maintaining that OPEC shouldn't have to cut production by a greater number of barrels than the non-OPEC group, and that the number of barrels cut should be equal whether the producer was big or small.    Moreover, the Saudis also argued, Iraq should be excluded from the cuts because it isn't in the cartel's production-quota system. The Saudis had the backing of other Arab producing states in the Persian Gulf region -- Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar -- and effectively split the cartel into two political groups, one supporting Iraq and the other its war foe and fellow OPEC member, Iran.    Deadlocked, the ministers ended their meeting and asked their five-member &quot;contact&quot; committee to continue negotiations with the non-OPEC group until the June 8 conference. Contact will continue nation-to-nation and through the committee, said Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister and president of OPEC.    The Saudi group has been pushing to get Iraq back into the OPEC quota system for some time. Iraq refuses to come back in unless it gets an allotment equal to Iran's 2.4 million barrels a day. Iraq, meanwhile, produces considerably more than that. Iraq's supporters argue that if it came back into the fold, it alone could make up the desired cuts in OPEC output.    The issue of Iraq, as well as the non-OPEC alliance, will be priority items on the agenda of the June meeting, OPEC officials said. </TEXT></DOC>
