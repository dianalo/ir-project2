The greenhouseis heated by an active solar system composed of air solar collectors,a rock bed storage and two heat pumps. Double layer polymetylmetacrilateis used as covering material and thermal screens made of aluminium andpolyester are employed for light control and energy saving. Climatic,meteorological and process data are collected by an automatic data acquisitionsystem for energetic behavior evaluations. The solar system has providedsatisfactory greenhouse temperatures during the winter and good levelsof relative humidity have been recorded. The quality of the plant productionwas excellent in shape and foliage.</TEXT></DOC>
