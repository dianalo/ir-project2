The higher mortgage rates stem from the government's drive topush up interest rates as a way of fighting Britain's resurgentinflation, which Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher repeatedly hassaid is her top economic priority.   Excluding mortgage payments, the annual rate of inflation stoodat 5.7 percent, said Norman Fowler, secretary of the Department ofEmployment.   The annual rate was above the 7.7 percent rate the markets hadbeen expecting and fueled speculation that interest rates might behoisted even higher than their current 13-percent level.   The pound held steady on the news. But share prices surprisinglygained, as investors took the report in stride ahead of the longEaster holiday weekend. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-shareindex, which had been down 6.4 points before the report, was down2.7 points, or 0.1 percent, at 2,045.9 afterward.   ``The reaction was very muted,'' said one London trader. ``Forsome people maybe, the figures weren't as scary as they thought.''   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson warned during his fiscalbudget speech earlier this month that he expected Britain's annualinflation rate to peak at around 8 percent in the middle of year,and that he expected the underlying rate, excluding mortgage rates,to peak at 5.5 percent, a level it surpassed with the latest report.   ``The chancellor already has some egg on his face,'' said KevinGardiner, economist at the London investment firm WarburgSecurities. ``The market was a little bit disappointed by thefigures.''   Lawson also said he expects the annual inflation rate to declineto 5.5 percent by the fourth quarter of 1989 and to 4.5 percent bythe second quarter of 1990.   ``Higher interest rates, which are affecting inflation in theshort term, will help bring the rate down in the longer term,''Fowler, the employment secretary, said. ``Indeed, retail sales haveeased off and the recent figures show the underlying trend to bebroadly flat since autumn.''   The commercial banks' base lending rate has risen to its current13 percent from 7.5 percent last summer.   The department said retail prices rose 0.7 percent in Februaryfrom January.   It said its retail price index stood at 111.8 in February, 111.0in January and 103.7 in February 1988. The index uses a 1987 base of100.   The department also blamed the higher prices on clothing, shoesand household goods following January sales. Gasoline prices alsowere up, it said.</TEXT></DOC>
