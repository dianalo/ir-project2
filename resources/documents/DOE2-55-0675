Plain radiography proved to be the best imaging methodto assess probable histological diagnosis in all cases (n=6). For theevaluation of chemotherapeutic response (n=4), CT and MRI gave the sameinformation about the variation in size of the tumor. It was not possiblewith MRI to differentiate active tumor from reactive change, even afterGd-DTPA infusion. At present MRI is of little value in diagnosis, andis no better than CT in evaluating the effectiveness of chemotherapy.It has, however, proved to be the best single examination for preoperativeevaluation of the extent of neoplastic involvement and follow-up of patientswith Ewing sarcoma.
