The revised estimates result from new statisticaltechniques used to analyze previously collected data. In a study jointlysponsored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the NuclearRegulatory Commission, the committee concluded that lifetime exposureto one working level month (WLM) of radon per year, a standard measureused by radiation experts, increases an individual's chances of dyingfrom lung cancer by 1.5 times compared with someone exposed only to backgroundlevels of radon. The committee estimated that, for every 1 million peopleexposed over a lifetime to one WLM of radon, about 350 additional deathswould occur due to lung cancer. The committee found that lung cancerrisks associated with radon increased with increasing length of exposure.Moreover, it said that 15 years after exposure to radon has ended, therisk of lung cancer from the exposure declines to half the original risk.</TEXT></DOC>
