After Louisiana banking authorities notified the FDIC that Citizens was in danger of failing, the agency Wednesday purchased poor-quality assets of the bank for $377,000. The struggling bank then was merged into First National Bank, Bienville Parish, La.    Citizens' one office will operate as a branch of First National and there will be no interruption of service to Citizens customers. Citizens had assets totaling $10.4 million and held deposits of $10.7 million.    Generally, the FDIC provides assistance only after a bank has failed. The agency will approve assistance to keep a bank open only if officials believe it is the least costly alternative.    This was the seventh time the FDIC provided assistance to an open bank in 1986. During the year, 138 banks failed -- the highest number since the Depression. </TEXT></DOC>
