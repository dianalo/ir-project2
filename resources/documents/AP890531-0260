James E. Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer,stated in a letter Tuesday to John Rochon, Mary Kay vice chairman:``We strongly believe our opportunities will be better achieved byAvon continuing with our business plan.''   In the letter, released by Avon, Preston indicated Mary Kay hashad a longstanding interest in Avon.   ``As I told you last January, we see no advantage to combiningour operations through some form of leveraged buyout or otherarrangement,'' Preston said.   The reference was to a Jan. 11 New York dinner meeting betweenPreston and Rochon, Avon spokesman John Cox said. The two had noother face-to-face contact and spoke by telephone only once, to setup the meeting.   During the meeting, attended only by the two executives, Rochonextolled the advantages of being a private company and askedPreston to take Avon private and unite with Mary Kay.   Rochon has been given much of the credit for the financialsuccess of the the 1985 leveraged buyout of the Dallas-baseddoor-to-door cosmetics company.   Rochon also told Preston an LBO could provide Preston with afinancial windfall, allowing him to leave the company in a fewyears several million dollars richer, Cox said.   Preston replied that he wasn't interested and even if he werecontemplating a leveraged buyout he wouldn't need Mary Kay to doit, according to the Avon spokesman.   Although the meeting occurred in January, Avon had been aware ofMary Kay's possible intentions earlier.   The first hint came two years ago when Joel Stern of theinvestment firm Stern Stewart andamp; Co. approached Avon about thepossibility of buying Mary Kay. He said he was working as aconsultant for Mary Kay, according to Cox.   Avon's management evaluated the idea and decided the two directsellers wouldn't make a good match, he said. Plus, Avon salesrepresentatives probably would have reacted negatively because, insome areas of the country, the Mary Kay sales force is the maincompetition.   Several months later in 1987 word came to Avon that someone waspreparing a hostile bid, Cox said. At about the same time, a publicrelations firm Avon had hired resigned the account on the groundsthere might be a conflict with another client's business. The otherclient was Mary Kay.   Over the two years, Avon has been told Mary Kay has searchedunsuccessfully for investment partners to help buy Avon, Cox said.Avon also learned Mary Kay wasn't interested in Avon'sinternational business, due to concerns about the risk of currencyfluctuations.   Avon has learned that Mary Kay started buying Avon shares lastNov. 10 but stopped short the threshold that would have triggeredfederal ownerhip disclosure requirements, Cox said.   No one at Mary Kay was available to comment on Avon's portrayalof the events, a public relations representative said.   Rochon publicly conveyed his company's feelings about Avon in aletter to Preston last week that was released by Mary Kay. No termsof proposed merger have been mentioned by Rochon.   Earlier this month, Avon's board rejected an offer by AmwayCorp. to buy Avon for $39 a share, or about $2.1 billion. Amwaylater withdrew the offer.   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading Tuesday, Avonclosed at $35.62{ a share, down $1.12{.</TEXT></DOC>
