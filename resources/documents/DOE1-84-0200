The burners must be designed for throughputsof 30 kg max. (360 kW) and are required to be of the oil-fired type.Continuous operation values must not exceed 150 mg/kWh (76 ppm/14% carbondioxide) nitrogen dioxides, i.e. nitrogen monoxides and nitrogen dioxides.Carbon monoxide emissions must not exceed 90 mg/kWh (75 ppm/14% carbondioxide). Organic substances (xHy) are limited to 19 mg/kWh (10 ppm/14%carbon dioxide) propane (C3H8) emissions.</TEXT></DOC>
