(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   American manufacturers need to installmore automated machinery or lose jobs and sales to efficientforeign competitors that share technology with their peers,according to a Harvard University study released Thursday.   The survey of more than 1,300 U.S. metalworking plants concludedthat American industry is clinging to an outdated notion that bigfirms should not share technological advances with potentialcompetitors.   ``Relations between large and small firms is not part of thebusiness culture in the United States,'' said Maryellen R. Kelley,an assistant management professor at Carnegie Mellon University inPittsburgh and one of the study's authors.   ``That kind of boost to small manufacturers that encourages themto automate is absent,'' she said.   The study found that more than half of U.S. metalworking plantshave not installed any computer-controlled machinery and just onein 10 plants planned to invest in computerization in 1988-89.   ``In the long run, if small manufacturers in particular don'tmodernize, they will no longer be able to compete ... with moresophisticated foreign suppliers,'' Kelley said. ``That couldultimately lead to a loss of jobs.''   The study found that just 11 percent of machine tools used inthe American metalworking industry are computer-controlled. Kelleysaid a similar 1985 study of Japanese firms found that 30 percentof the total stock was computer-run.   ``The model of the self-interested, do-it-alone small businessdriven by a gear of cut-throat competition ... seems to be apeculiarly American phenomenon,'' the report issued by the Centerfor Business and Government at the John F. Kennedy School ofGovernment said.   The authors said America's competitive culture ``must change ifU.S. industry is to continue to be an industrial power in the worldeconomy.'' In countries such as Japan and Italy potentialcompetitors as well as buyers and suppliers routinely shareinformation, they said.   The survey of metalworking and machinery manufacturers in 21durable goods industries, including hardware, plumbing and forging,was based on a national mail questionnaire and interviews with morethan 1,300 firms nationwide. An equal distribution of companieswith workforces ranging from under 20 to more than 250 was used.   The study, ``The State of Computerized Automation in U.S.Manufacturing,'' was conducted from September 1986 to April 1987.It was funded by the National Science Foundation and the U.S.Congress' Office of Technology Assessment.   According to the survey, 53 percent of U.S. plants useconventional machinery while 47 percent have some type ofcomputer-operated machines.   ``Surprisingly we found that there has not been much adoption ofcompetitive technology _ and this is after five years of economicrecovery,'' Kelley, a Kennedy School research associate, said in aninterview.   Small manufacturers have resisted the adoption ofcomputer-controlled technology partly out of a fear of job lossesthrough automation and partly because high expenses would requireproduct diversification, Kelley said.   ``It certainly seems that this technology is more efficient andseems to be more flexible,'' she said. ``But that means a shift inbusiness strategy is required.''   The 22 percent of plants that said they have not adoptedcomputer-controlled technology and have no plans to do so accountedfor 1 million jobs in 1986 _ jobs Kelley said are threatened byforeign competition.   The industries surveyed make tools used in machinery forproduction of a variety of durable goods, from furniture toclothing. Kelley said three types of machines dominate the field:numerically controlled, computer numerically controlled andflexible manufacturing systems.   Numerically controlled machinery is usully manually operated.Computer numerically controlled machinery allows machines to beprogrammed to automatically execute a set of metal-cuttingoperations, which reduces the cost of set-up and permits repeatruns of a product.   Flexible manufacturing systems, used by just 1.5 percent of thefirms surveyed, are computer numerically controlled machines linkedby automatic material-handling equipment such as robots orconveyors.</TEXT></DOC>
