(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Studying tread marks as carefully as otherforensic experts scrutinize fingerprints, Peter McDonald uses hisexperience as a former Firestone tire designer to uncovercrime-solving clues.   ``I think it requires a trained eye,'' said McDonald, 58, whohas taught tire print identification at police academies in about15 states and a few Canadian provinces. He spoke at an FBI Academysymposium in 1984.   McDonald testified this week at a preliminary court hearing inthe Kunz family slayings, a case that investigators labored on formore than a year before charging a man with being a party to themurders.   Four family members were found shot to death July 5, 1987. Afifth member was missing until her remains were found nearly ninemonths later.   McDonald testified that a gap left by a stone in a tire cutpositively identified a tire on the charged man's car as havingmade a track found at the murder scene.   ``No other tire in the world could have made that impression,''he told the court.   McDonald, who designed tires for 28 years at Firestone Tire andRubber Co., began identifying tire prints about 10 years ago whenhe was contacted by police in California. He later started aHudson, Ohio, consulting firm.   ``Being a manager of tire design, I was involved in checkingother people's work,'' he said Thursday. ``That training, plus thefact that I'm an artist and studied architecture, I feel gives me aleg up on people who come to this from a strictly scientificbackground.''   At the FBI laboratory in Washington, supervisory Special AgentWilliam J. Bodziak said he has articles dating back to the 1930sthat refer to tire identification.   But identifying tire prints is less common than fingerprints orshoe prints and ``there's no real course'' to teach it, Bodziaksaid. The six FBI examiners who do tire identification work at thelab have learned their trade mainly from other examiners andexperience, he said.   The Michigan State Police Crime Laboratory has operated acomputer program to help identify tire tracks for at least eightyears in East Lansing, but analysts there receive ``mostlyon-the-job training and training by Mr. McDonald,'' said FrankSchehr, assistant director.   ``Peter McDonald ... is quite an expert in that area,'' he said.   McDonald said he has testified in four homicide cases, one rapecase and a civil case involving a young girl who was hit by avehicle.   On Wednesday, he was in Marathon County Circuit Court in apreliminary hearing for Chris Jacobs III, a 22-year-oldnorth-central Wisconsin man charged with five counts of being aparty to the first-degree murders of the Kunz family members.   McDonald spent most of the day on the stand explaining hismethods.   He said he begins with scale photographs of the tracks found atthe crime scene and inked impressions of any suspect tires.   He identifies tread patterns by studying the length of pitchesor zigzag patterns around the tire. The manufacturer varies theselengths to help reduce the amount of noise the tires make, he said.   He then compares 13 items in the prints, including the shapes ofthe tire tread elements, the number of raised ribs and size ofpitch lengths, to determine the brand and design of tire.   McDonald said he looks for variations in the tire tracks andinked impressions to see if they share characteristics of the sametire manufacturing mold.   If the tracks and impressions share the same brand and moldcharacteristics, McDonald uses the manufacturer's tire plans tostudy the general accidental characteristics, or signs of wear.   But to make a positive identification, McDonald said he needs tofind something like a gap caused by a stone or indications of atorn piece of rubber.</TEXT></DOC>
