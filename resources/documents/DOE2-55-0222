Argentina, show thatthe ignimbrites exhibit a remarkable range of spectral characteristicsdependent both on intrinsic and extrinsic properties resulting from aeolianweathering processes. Spectral profiles of the ignimbrite in four contrastedenvironments were constructed using 6 TM bands. The textural and structuralcharacteristics of ignimbrites on Mars were evaluated.</TEXT></DOC>
