In 1973, when he was president, Ferdinand E. Marcos mandated apolicy of using English and Filipino, a Malay language based on theTagalog dialect, in elementary and high schools.   English had been used exclusively in schools since the UnitedStates took control of the Philippines from Spain in 1899 and isstill widely spoken by the educated elite.   The new constitution, drafted after President Corazon Aquinotook office from Marcos, reinforced the commitment to promoteFilipino while retaining English as a second official language.Spanish was dropped as an official language.   Last year, the Education Department declared that English wouldno longer be an exclusive language for teaching science andtechnology in elementary and high schools and that Filipino shouldbe developed ``as a linguistic symbol of national unity andidentity.''   As part of the drive, government television switched its mainevening newscast from English to Filipino. Four of the five privatetelevision stations have expanded the use of Filipino in newscasts.   Ponciano Pineda, director of the Institute for PhilippineLanguages, said the bilingual campaign is designed to ``makeFilipino the language of intellectual pursuit.''   But the campaign has run into stumbling blocks because of thenature and background of the language.   In the 1930s, President Manuel Quezon decreed that theManila-area dialect, Tagalog, would become the basis of a nationallanguage.   But Tagalog is used as the principal language by only about 30percent of the country's 58 million people. Speakers of variousVisayan dialects, used in the central islands and Mindanao, form aslight majority.   To make the decision more palatable to other linguistic groups,the language was called ``Pilipino'' and later ``Filipino.'' Somewords and grammatical constructions from other native languageswere added.   That has led to a debate among language scholars over spellings,as well as the extent to which foreign words, notably English,should be considered acceptable.   A group of professors tried to promote phonetic spellings, suchas ``sabjek'' for the English ``subject'' and ``nawn'' for ``noun''in an effort to mirror Filipino pronunciation.   Pineda of the languages institute says borrowing of words can beacceptable if they have been ``Filipinized,'' such as ``kudeta''for ``coup d'etat.''   But the widespread use of ``loan words'' has produced whatcritics call ``Taglish'' a mix English and Tagalog.   Educated Filipinos, especially in Manila, frequently switch fromEnglish to Filipino in conversations, beginning a sentence in onelanguage and ending it in the other.   Words such as ``magbeysbol,'' or ``to play baseball,'' havecrept into the language. The residue of 350 years of Spanishcolonialism lives on in such words as ``mesa,'' for table and``tindahan'' from the Spanish ``tienda,'' meaning shop.   Professor Jesus Ramos, a Filipino-language teacher at theUniversity of the Philippines, defends the use of English wordsbecause it ``mirrors the use of the national language by allFilipinos.''   Most of the nearly 30 newspapers in Manila are published inEnglish, as are numerous legal documents, magazines and books.   Mrs. Aquino, who was educated in the United States, uses Englishfor most of her major speeches. Debates in Congress are normallyconducted in English.   Critics complain that the bilingual policy has resulted in adeterioration of English skills. They believe the country should bepromoting English because it affords greater opportunity for studyand work here and abroad.   But Pineda said: ``The purpose for which we started teachingEnglish in the 1900s no longer holds. We used to think that onlythrough the window of English could we look at the picture of life,but we have discovered that this is not true.''   Professor Ramos predicts that Filipino eventually will supplantEnglish and that the need for English loan words will fade.   ``If English will weaken here, borrowing of English words willalso lessen,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Tues PMs May 24</NOTE></DOC>
