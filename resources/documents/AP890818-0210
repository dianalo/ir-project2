A tentative agreement was worked out between Bell Atlantic andthe Communications Workers of America on Thursday after more thantwo months of bargaining and a strike that slowed services to BellAtlantic customers in the mid-Atlantic states.   Regional issues were resolved while leaving local issues to beworked out in further talks.   Bell Atlantic subsidiaries were to resume talks today with theCWA on the local issues. Bargaining also was to continue with theInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.   Both unions also are striking another regional Bell company,NYNEX, which serves the Northeast. CWA alone is striking two otherregional Bells: Ameritech, which serves five Midwestern states; andPacific Telesis, which serves California and Nevada.   Pacific Bell spokesman Lou Saviano said CWA and Pacificnegotiators made ``very substantial progress yesterday'' and the daybefore, but there still were unresolved issues. Talks continuedtoday.   No contract talks were scheduled at NYNEX or Ameritech.   In Washington, CWA spokesman Bill Bickers said the Bell Atlanticagreement will have no direct effect on the other strikes, but``hopefully this will give some impetus to those units to reach anagreement.''   Union officials said the CWA workers will not return to work atBell Atlantic until all local issues are resolved and the IBEWreaches agreement with the company. But both sides said a finalaccord could be reached within days.   ``The major strike issues of wages and health benefits have beenresolved,'' Bickers said at a news conference. ``This does not meanthat the strike is over. But the way has been paved to resolve localissues. We are prepared to negotiate around the clock over the nextseveral days to settle the outstanding issues.''   Company spokesman Christopher Clouser called the agreement ``veryfair'' and one that balances the needs of employees, customers andshareowners.   ``We're very confident and hopeful that it's both in our interestand the union's to have people back to work ... next week,'' Clousersaid.   The local issues include disputes over job-title and work-rulechanges at each of Bell Atlantic's subsidiaries in Pennsylvania, NewJersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the Districtof Columbia.   Wages and employee contributions to health-insurance plans havebeen major issues blocking settlement of the contracts with the fourcompanies' nearly 200,000 employees in 20 states and the District ofColumbia.   The striking workers include operators, telephone installers andrepairmen, factory workers and some sales and clerical personnel.All four companies have continued service using managementpersonnel, but there have been delays for customers seeking someinstallation and operator services.   The tentative CWA-Bell Atlantic agreement calls for an immediate3 percent pay raise for the 41,000 CWA workers. They would receiveraises of 2\ percent in both the second and final years of thecontract. The CWA workers also would receive a cost-of-livingadjustment in the latter two years of the contract and aprofit-sharing payment in all three years.   Outside the headquarters of Bell Telephone Co. of Pennsylvania inPhiladelphia, picket Mary Angela Kane said: ``Seven and a halfpercent is not much, but it's better than nothing. It'll feed my twokids.''   The union agreed to a ``managed care plan'' designed to provideimproved benefits and prevent significant increases forout-of-pocket health care expenses _ if union workers use healthcare providers recommended by Bell Atlantic.   Bell Atlantic has subsidiaries serving 12.7 million customers. Ithas 52,000 workers on strike, including about 11,000 IBEW workers.
