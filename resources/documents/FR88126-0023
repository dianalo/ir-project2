Finally, 43 CFR Part 3570was renumbered 43 CFR Part 3590 by the final rulemaking on 43 CFR Group3500 published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 12, 1986 (51 FR 15204).Throughout the proposed rulemaking, minor changes would be made in theorganization, sentence structure, and wording of the text for the purposeof clarifying and streamlining the regulations. Additionally, and for thesame reasons, the proposed rulemaking would add definitions of the terms``established requirements'' and ``ultimate maximum recovery'' to andSection;3590.0-5. The term ``established requirements'' would be defined to meanall legal conditions, such as, applicable laws and regulations, lease,license, or permit terms, conditions and special stipulations, approvedmine or exploration plan requirements, and order issued by the authorizedofficer which are binding on the operator/lessee. The use of this termis designed to streamline the regulations by avoiding repetition of allthe applicable legal requirements throughout the text. The term ``ultimatemaximum recovery'' is not new since it was included in the existing regulations,but the term has not been previously defined. It would be defined in theproposed rulemaking, using as its basis standard industry operating practices.   The proposed rulemaking would expand Subpart 3592, entitled <T3>Maps and Plans.</T3> This expansion would not increase the amount ofinformation requested from an operator/lessee because the Bureau of LandManagement currently obtains this information during its mine plan review.However, the proposed rulemaking would add to the regulations a more detailedlisting of mine plan requirements which will be used by the operator/lesseeand will facilitate the transmittal of a complete mine plan package. Therequired material is necessary for use by the authorized officer in reviewingand approving the plan and is not expected to cause an undue burden onthe operator/lessee. The provisions in the proposed rulemaking are designedto speed the mine plan approval process by ensuring that the operator/lesseeis aware of the information that must be submitted, thus avoiding, in mostcases, requests by the authorized officer for additional information. However,the proposed rulemaking would not remove the authority of the authorizedofficer to require any additional information deemed necessary for approvalof a plan. The public is specifically requested to review and comment onthe expanded requirements in Subpart 3592.    The principal author of this proposed rulemaking is W. Vance Greer, Divisionof Solid Mineral Operations, Bureau of Land Management, assisted by thestaff of the Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management, Bureauof Land Management and staff of the Office of the Solicitor, Departmentof the Interior.            If is hereby determined that this rulemaking does not constitute a majorFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environmentand that no detailed statement pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is required. The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is nota major rule under Executive Order 12291 and that it will not have a significanteconomic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). It has been determined that the likely impact per lease of the changesmade by this proposed rulemaking will not exceed the economic thresholdset forth in Executive Order 12291. Further, the impact of the proposedrulemaking will impact equally all operators/lessees, whether large orsmall. The information collection requirements contained in this proposed rulemakinghave been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C.3507 and assigned clearance number 1004_0142. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects 43 CFR Part 3590 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Indian lands_mineral resources,Mineral royalties, Mines, Public lands_mineral resources, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements.Under the authority of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended andsupplemented (30 U.S.C. 181 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands of 1947,as amended (30 U.S.C. 351-359), the Federal land Policy and ManagementAct of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 <T3>et seq.</T3>), Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1946 (5 U.S.C.
