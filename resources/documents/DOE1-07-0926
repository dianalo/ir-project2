The structure is laminated,Ce-polyhedrons are condensed. Some regularities of MTR (SO/sub 4/)/sub2/xH/sub 2/O (M=Li-Rb) structure are considered. There are: specificsof morphotropy in rare earth and Li-Rb series, of frame-layer transformationsand crystallochemical analogies in the structure of MTR (SO/sub 4/)/sub2/xH/sub 2/O and other compounds with tetrahedral anions.</TEXT></DOC>
