The real culprit, in Mr. Conlan's mind, was Wells Fargo andamp; Co. He sued the San Francisco-based bank in state court, claiming it had illegally cut off his credit. Last month, he won $60 million in damages, one of the largest judgments ever against a financial institution. Wells Fargo plans to seek a new trial.    The Conlan case shows how the farm crisis, already the source of huge loan losses for banks, is getting costlier in court. A growing number of farmers are attacking bank lending practices in lawsuits, winning large judgments, based on findings of fraud, breach of promise and other offenses. Most of the major cases have occurred in California, where banks have loaned heavily to farmers over the past several years.    The banks claim the large judgments reflect juries acting on emotion rather than reason. Several days after the Wells Fargo verdict, another state court awarded $50 million in damages against BankAmerica Corp., also in San Francisco. The farm-owner plaintiffs included two octogenarian sisters, longtime BankAmerica customers who kept hundreds of thousands of dollars in low-interest passbook accounts. Furthermore, the sisters, members of a farm family from Sutter County, Calif., are distant relatives of BankAmerica founder A.P. Giannini, who bankrolled thousands of hard-pressed San Francisco residents after the 1906 earthquake.    Defending such cases &quot;is a . . . difficult thing to deal with,&quot; says a lawyer for a major bank. But the farmers contend the banks are being arrogant by refusing to admit their mistakes. &quot;They aren't used to being challenged,&quot; says Richard Murphy, a Lodi, Calif., attorney who represented the plaintiffs in the case against BankAmerica. &quot;They think they have the divine right of kings.&quot;    Mr. Conlan's problems began when he took out a $5 million Wells Fargo loan in April 1982. His Lightning Farms, once the world's largest grower of spinach, had a loss the first year, but he said the bank seemed to understand. In July 1983, for instance, he was a guest of Wells Fargo chairman Carl Reichardt at the Salinas Rodeo, sharing barbecue and hunting stories with the executive.    Four months later, however, the bank told Mr. Conlan that it was pulling out, citing his continuing losses, according to court documents. In exchange for an interest in a second farm, it put off foreclosure proceedings, giving Mr. Conlan a chance to find another lender. But the search for help failed. Without a financial backer, he plowed under 1,000 acres of mixed vegetables, and headed to bankruptcy court, where in 1984 he filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, the documents said. The filing blocked the bank; then Mr. Conlan filed the lawsuit against Wells Fargo.    In his suit, Mr. Conlan alleged that Wells Fargo acted prematurely, breaking a promise to support him through the early years, which he claims the bank knew would be rough. The loan agreement gave Wells Fargo a right to stop lending if losses persisted, but Mr. Conlan said the agreement was ambiguous over the precise amounts in losses required before the right was triggered.    Wells Fargo, meanwhile, denied making unqualified assurances. &quot;Any bank hopes a lending relationship will be long term,&quot; says William Trautman, an attorney for the bank. &quot;But it isn't unconditional.&quot;    The jury believed Mr. Conlan, however, awarding $10 million in compensatory damages and $50 million in punitive damages. Wells Fargo believes it didn't receive a fair trial, and is expected to ask the court for a new one today.    The first one included testimony that a Wells Fargo loan officer had shredded a file related to the case. The bank said the file merely included copies of old documents. But the jury was skeptical, hearing the testimony soon after congressional investigators in Washington unveiled new evidence of rampant document-shredding in the Iran-Contra scandal. Whatever the reason, the shredding at Wells Fargo &quot;just didn't sit well,&quot; said William Lukens, Mr. Conlan's attorney. Mr. Trautman said the evidence was inflammatory and shouldn't have been allowed.    In BankAmerica's case, the plaintiffs won after arguing that the bank aggressively sought out the farmers, touting its loan officers as computer-aided experts and urging particular operating decisions. BankAmerica contends &quot;the ranch didn't suffer losses on our account,&quot; but the decision was its second recent defeat in a big farm case. Last July, an apple growers group won a $26 million judgment, which the bank is appealing.    Such successes are encouraging more suits, adding to the already growing number of customers in other industries that are bringing their lenders to court. In May, a furniture store operator won a $59 million judgment against a Texas Commerce Bancshares unit; last month, Bank of California lost a $26 million verdict in another farm-related case.    The banks contend the litigation spree could backfire on farmers and other borrowers, forcing them to curb future lending. But plaintiffs say juries are sending banks a message. &quot;If the banks don't change their ways,&quot; said Mr. Conlan, &quot;they're going to get thumped again.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
