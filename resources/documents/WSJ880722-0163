Three of the planes are A-300-310s and one is a larger A-300-600. Both types of planes can carry about 200 passengers.    In 1979, Lufthansa agreed with Airbus Industrie to buy 25 A-310 or A-300 types. It also took options on an additional 25.    Delivery of the latest planes is scheduled to take place between November 1989 and February 1990.    The West German national airline said the order reflects its expectations for increased demand in the early 1990s.    Airbus Industrie is a consortium of Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace PLC, Spain's Construccionnes Aeronauticas S.A. and Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany. </TEXT></DOC>
