The reporter, Gerald F. Seib, was taken into custody Saturday. The Journal's managing editor called Seib &quot;a highly respected&quot; correspondent and said &quot;there can be no basis for his detention.&quot; Seib was among 57 reporters invited by Tehran last week to tour the Iran-Iraq war zone. Iran's news agency said &quot;a spy of the Zionist regime&quot; had entered Iran with a false passport, posing as a journalist, but didn't give a name or nationality. The Journal emphasized that given Seib's professional status, there was &quot;no reason to link&quot; his detention with the report.    The State Department, which said it didn't know the reason for Seib's detention, urged that he be released immediately and allowed to depart from Iran.    ---   White House aides confirmed that Reagan periodically made private notes that contain some references to the administration's Iran policy.
