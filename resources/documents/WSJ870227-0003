In testimony before a House Banking subcommittee, Mr. Volcker said the accord contains no &quot;specific commitment about monetary policy.&quot; He stressed that the agreement, designed to stabilize exchange rates at current levels, assumes that the involved countries will carry out certain policies designed to reduce global trade imbalances. These include efforts by the U.S. to reduce the federal budget deficit and action by West Germany and Japan to spur their domestic economies.    The dollar has been fairly stable since the accord was reached last weekend. But in response to questions yesterday, Mr. Volcker acknowledged that monetary policy would be one of the tools available to stop a sharp new decline in the U.S. currency should one occur. He said any decision on whether to tighten credit would be a &quot;judgment call&quot; depending on the circumstances that accompanied the dollar's plunge.    In other comments, the Fed chief said that while it is &quot;important&quot; to keep the inflation rate below 4% this year, he wouldn't be alarmed by a rate exceeding 3% if it were due largely to the &quot;temporary&quot; effect of higher prices for energy and imported goods.    Mr. Volcker said the recent exchange-rate accord underscores the view that a further sharp drop in the dollar could have dangerous implications for the economies of the U.S. and its trading partners. He said there are &quot;dangerous imbalances in the world economy&quot; and that the policy steps needed to address them are difficult politically both here and abroad. He cautioned that the process of correcting the imbalances will require a &quot;steady, plodding effort over a period of years.&quot;    Concerning inflation, Mr. Volcker warned against &quot;relaxing on this front,&quot; even though he expects that a pick-up this year will result from &quot;temporary external factors.&quot; Among other things, the drop in the dollar has raised prices for imports, giving domestic producers more room to raise their prices.    However, he said that wage and salary increases have been more moderate recently and that the pace of service sector inflation has slowed. Prices of services have tended to rise more rapidly than prices in the rest of the economy.    Reiterating his plea for congressional action to reduce the budget deficit, Mr. Volcker said he didn't &quot;see anything the matter&quot; with the idea of a line-item veto, which would allow the president to veto individual items in spending bills without killing the entire measures.    He also suggested that the growth in federal outlays could be curbed if spending programs required more than the simple majority that other bills need to be approved. </TEXT></DOC>
