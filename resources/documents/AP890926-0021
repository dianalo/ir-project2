JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Assoicated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Few viewers are seeing it yet, but the autoindustry already is crying foul over a public service ad on globalwarming that environmentalists are sending to radio and TV stationsnationwide.   And Detroit wants equal time.   The ad was unveiled a week ago by the Environmental ActionFoundation, which said it was distributing the 30-second spots tohundreds of radio and television stations to spread the warningabout global warming and, specifically, what part the automobileplays.   Thomas H. Hanna, president of the Motor Vehicle ManufacturersAssociation, quickly dispatched a letter to 200 TV stations and 850radio stations calling the ad ``clearly political'' and full ofmisinformation.   He wrote that if the environmentalists' spots are used as apublic service announcement ``we intend to demand equal time torebut the misinformation and misleading material they contain.''   On Monday, Ruth Caplan, executive director of theWashington-based environmental group, distributed a copy of Hanna'sletter at a news conference and accused the industry group oftrying to ``muzzle public education on the environmental impact ofautomobiles.''   She characterized the industry's call for equal time as``ludicrous'' and denied the thrust of the 30-second advertisement,which calls pollution from automobiles ``a major cause'' of globalwarming, is misleading.   In a telephone interview, Hanna defended his Sept. 19 letter tothe radio and TV stations.   Hanna charged the environmentalists were misusing free air timeunder public service provisions by making a political statement and``advancing their legislative agenda ... That's grass rootslobbying.''   He maintained the ad overstates the threat of global warming,which he said was still disputed in the scientific community, andputs too much of the blame on pollution from U.S. automobiles.   Carbon dioxide, which is released in the burning of fossilfuels, is a major contributor to the so-called ``greenhouseeffect'' _ the creation of a gaseous veil in the atmosphere.Scientists are concerned that if accumulation of these``greenhouse'' gases goes unchecked, the Earth may warmsignificantly by the middle of the next century.   U.S. automobiles, however, are only one source of carbon dioxideand are believed to be the source of only about 2.5 percent of allthe greenhouse gases worldwide, according to the EnvironmentalProtection Agency. Nevertheless, a reduction of carbon dioxideemissions from motor vehicles and other sources is widely seen asessential to reducing the global warming threat.   The environmental group's 30-second spot opens with a shotdirectly into the sun and the announcer calling global warming ``adisease of the Earth.'' It quickly pans a desert landscape and thenshifts to highway and city streets clogged with cars and truckswhile the announcer says ``a major cause of global warming'' ispollution from automobiles.   ``We need more fuel efficient cars,'' continues the announcerover a scene of a family with its car, followed by a closeup ofarid, parched earth.   Hanna said he would not object if the spots were run as paidadvertisements that give a point of view, but said theenvironmentalists should not be given free air time.   ``Detroit spends millions of dollars each year to advertisetheir new model cars and light trucks,'' replied Ms. Caplan. ``Forthe industry to request free air time to respond to our modestpublic education campaign is ludicrous.''   Hanna said there are no plans to prepare a counter-ad in caseequal time is granted by a TV or radio operator. But he saidspokesmen would be available to ``make people aware there's anotherpoint of view.''</TEXT></DOC>
