(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Steven Stayner, whose seven-year ordeal asa sexually abused kidnapped child was the subject of a televisionminiseries, died in a hit-and-run collision near the town where hewas abducted 17 years ago.   The California Highway Patrol said Sunday it was searching forthe employee of a Merced tomato packing company who witnesses saidwas the driver of the car that hit Stayner's motorcycle Saturday.   Stayner, 7 when he was abducted in 1972 and 14 when he escaped,was killed as he rode his motorcycle between Merced and Atwater,about 125 miles east of San Francisco, where he lived with his wifeand two young children. He was 24.   ``Why him again?'' asked Sandy Hawkins, a close friend of theStayner family.   Though the family declined to be interviewed, Hawkins quoted KayStayner, the victim's mother, as saying she felt like her son hadbeen ``loaned to us.''   Hawkins also quoted one of Stayner's sisters as saying: ``He wasmissing for so long, and then came back, that if we got a telephonecall saying it was all a mistake, and he was all right, it wouldn'tbe hard to believe.''   In 1972, Stayner was grabbed off the street while walking homefrom school in Merced by convicted child molester Kenneth Parnell.As the two moved around Mendocino and Sonoma counties north of SanFrancisco, Stayner was known as Dennis Parnell.   Seven years later, Parnell snatched another boy, 5-year-old TimmyWhite, and Stayner 16 days later escaped in Ukiah, taking Timmy withhim.   In May, Stayner was the subject of a NBC miniseries, ``I Know MyName Is Steven,'' which dramatized his life as Parnell's purportedson.   ``My hope with the movie is that some kid sees it and gets up thenerve to tell someone and try to come home,'' Stayner told aninterviewer in April.   Parnell was arrested in 1980 while working as a hotel clerk inUkiah, 120 miles north of San Francisco, and was sentenced in 1982to eight years in prison on two counts of kidnapping.   Parnell, who had been convicted years earlier for sexuallyabusing an 8-year-old boy he abducted, spent five years in SoledadPrison. Now 57, Parnell is believed living somewhere in northernCalifornia.   While no sex charges were filed against Parnell in the Staynercase, Stayner testified at the trial that he was regularly sexuallyabused during the period they lived in motels and trailer parks andwas ordered to call Parnell ``Dad.''   The driver who struck Stayner ditched his car two miles from thescene, jumped into another car and fled, said highway patrol Sgt.Bill Balestra. The driver could face felony hit-and-run charges,Balestra said.   Stayner, who was not wearing a helmet, did not have a motorcyclelicense, said officer Allen Maxfield. His driver's license had beensuspended because of numerous traffic violations.</TEXT></DOC>
