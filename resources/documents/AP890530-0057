MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush today hailed the``double hit'' unity forged on nuclear and conventional armsproposals at his first NATO summit, and asserted he would notaccept elimination of short-range nuclear missiles from Europe.   ``There will be no third zero,'' he said in a reference to armscontrol jargon for scrapping the missiles.   ``Partial is partial,'' Bush said referring to the language ofan official NATO communique under which the alliance will negotiatecuts in short-range missiles, but only after East-West conventionalforce reductions are underway.   ``To try to interpret it some other way misses the boat,'' Bushsaid in a news conference that ended the two-day NATO summit. Thepresident was departing Belgium today for West Germany where themissile question had been vehemently debated by officials seekingimmediate negotiations.   In his news conference, the president tried to turn the tableson Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev's publicly appealing armscontrol proposals.   He noted a large Warsaw Pact advantage in short-range nuclearweapons in Europe, and said, ``Why don't they just unilaterallyreduce to equal numbers. Now there'd be a challenge.''   Asked how he was faring in an international public relations warwith Gorbachev, Bush said, ``I've read who some think was winning.That was yesterday.''   He said he'd be willing to meet with Gorbachev later this yearif ``something constructive'' could come from such a summit.   Bush hailed the results of the NATO meetings, saying the``successful results at this summit have given us a double hit,both conventional forces and short range nuclear forces.'' He saidthat ``taken in tandem, it demonstrates the alliance's ability'' toadapt to change.   Bush opened the news conference with a statement declaring thatthe alliance's ``overall aim is to overcome the division of Europeand to forge a unity based on Western values.'' He expressed hopethat his arms proposals _ which would reduce Moscow's advantage inEuropean military force _ would ``finally free Europe from theconstant threat of a surprise attack and the shadow or Sovietmilitary power.''   As for Gorbachev, who only hours earlier had revealed thestaggering size of the Soviet military budget at $118 billion, Bushsaid ``This will help him ... This should save him a lot of moneyin the long run.''   He described the initial Soviet reaction to his conventionalforce proposal as ``positive,'' then turning to aides for guidancehe added that at least ``they didn't really slam the door'' on it.   Bush defended the carefully worded NATO compromise that callsfor negotiations to reduce short range nuclear missiles only afteran East-West agreement has been reached to reduce conventionalforces and reductions are actually underway.   The official NATO communique represents a careful compromiseover West Germany's initial demand for negotiations soon to reduceand perhaps eliminate the short-range missiles.   ``There will be no third zero,'' he said, emphasizing, ``Partialis partial.''   As for Gorbachev, Bush said he believed the Soviet leader``knows we've been serious'' in completing a lengthy review ofpolicy. Gorbachev recently proposed a large reduction inconventional forces in Europe, where the Soviet Unmion and itsEastern European allies maintain superiority over the West.   The Soviet bloc also has a large advantage in short-rangenuclear missiles, according to U.S. officials, roughly 2,400 singlewarhead missiles to 700 for the West.   Bush's proposal for sharp reductions in conventional forces inEurope won enthusiastic agreement from the allies. Bush wants thesereductions negotiated with Moscow before taking up the nuclearmissile question. NATO must decide on whether to modernize theshort-range nuclear missiles by 1992.   The Soviet bloc has far greater numbers of soldiers andconventional forces that the United States and NATO forces.Grobachev has recently proposed a reduction in his side, and Bushwon NATO endorsement during the summit for his plan to reduce U.S.and Soviet forces to equal levels.   Bush noted that when he arrived in Brussels he was under firefor apparently being recalcitrant in response to appealing Sovietarms proposals. But he said he was elected president ``to do what Ithink was right,'' and added, ``I think we've come up with a goodproposal here.''   Bush said the ``successful results at this summit have given usa double hit, both conventional forces and short range nuclearforces, and taken in tandem it demonstrates the alliance'sability'' to adapt to change.   The president held out the hope of reduced tensions in which itwould be possible to ``move beyond the era of containment. Ouroverall aim is to overcome the division of Europe and to forge aunity based on western values.''   In particular, the president told one questioner he was watchingevents in Poland and said if authorities there were prepared toembrace western values, ``we will be ready to have much betterrelations.''   Bush is planning to visit Poland later this summer.</TEXT></DOC>
