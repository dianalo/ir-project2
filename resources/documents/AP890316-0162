Moslem guerrillas claimed Thursday they had shot down two moreaircraft in heavy fighting for Jalalabad, a strategic eastern citythat is the nation's third-largest. The communist government claimed470 insurgents killed in the previous 24 hours.   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Vorontsov said the airlift resumedWednesday, a month after the Red Army left the Kabul government tofight the insurgents on its own.   He said the weapons included medium-range Scud B missiles, whichare said to have been fired from Kabul at guerrilla positions aroundJalababad, 75 miles to the east and 40 miles from the Pakistanborder.   Sources said at least 40 Ilyushin-76 transport planes had landedat thge Kabul airport since Wednesday with military supplies andfood.   Vorontsov accused Pakistan of sending hundreds of its ownsoldiers with the guerrillas in the intense, 10-day battle forJalalabad.   ``We have discussed the situation with the Pakistanis and theyknow what our reaction will be if their involvement continues,'' hesaid. ``We are not threatening the Pakistanis, but they must stop.''   Pakistan supports the guerrillas, along with the United States,but denies any of its soldiers are fighting in Afghanistan. TheForeign Ministry called Vorontsov's allegation ``fictitious.''   In Moscow, the official news agency Tass said Pakistani forceswere coordinating the attack on Jalalabad and forcing teen-agerefugees to take up arms.   ``Units of Pakistani mercenaries were ordered to carry out forcedmobilization starting from age 14 in the Afghan refugee camps nearPeshawar,'' Tass in a dispatch from Kabul.   ``Eyewitness accounts indicate that hundreds of refugee familieshave decided to return to Afghanistan on learning about the order,''it said. ``Protests against the arbitrary actions of the Pakistanimilitary flared up in several camps.''   Tass said Afghan insurgents and Pakistani soldiers fired onprotesters, killing seven people and wounding 12 others.   A separate Tass dispatch from Kabul accused Pakistaniintelligence officers of coordinating the guerrilla attack.   Moslem guerrillas began fighting in Afghanistan after a communistcoup in April 1978. Soviet military forces arrived in December 1979,and an estimated 115,000 were in the country when the U.N.-mediatedwithdrawal began May 15, 1988.   Observers believe a guerrilla victory at Jalalabad, along themain highway from Pakistan to Kabul, could lead to the fall of thecapital.   The guerrilla-run Afghan News Agency said insurgents downed ahelicopter gunship near Jalalabad's television station and anairplane outside the city on Wednesday.   The latest guerrilla claim brought to seven the number ofgovernment aircraft reported destroyed this week in the fight forJalalabad.   There was no immediate comment from the Afghan government, and itwas not possible to confirm the claims.   Kabul radio claimed Thursday that 470 insurgents were killed inthe last 24 hours around Jalalabad, bringing the total for two daysto 1,030. Guerrillas call the Kabul claims widely exaggerated.   It said only six of its troops were killed in the Jalalabadfighting in the last 24 hours. It also said the guerrillas fired``thousands of rockets and artillery shells'' into Jalalabad duringthis period, killing four civilians and injuring 18.   The guerrilla-run Afghan News Agency said 25 Afghan troops werekilled and 32 captured in Jalalabad on Thursday.   Guerrillas have overrun the city's most important garrison,Samarkhel to the east, and were closing in on the airport.   But Afghan soldiers retaliated with unexpectedly aggressiveaerial and artillery bombardments that reportedly have stalled theguerrillas' progress.   Fighting centers north, west and south of the city, according toreports reaching Pakistan.   Leaders of the U.S.-supported guerrillas have predicted an earlycollapse of the Kabul government in the absence of its Sovietbackers, but President Najib has insisted his forces are strongenough to survive.</TEXT></DOC>
