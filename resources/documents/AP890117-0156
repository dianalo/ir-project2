Mayor Xavier Suarez declared the situation in the Overtownneighborhood under control this morning and called for aninvestigation.   ``There was a tranquility in Overtown this morning,'' Suarez saidat a news conference. ``The people know we are working towardfinding out the truth.''   Suarez said he found nothing to substantiate claims by somemembers of the black community that the unrest was caused byresentment over the waves of Nicaraguan immigrants coming to Miami.   He said he planned no curfew.   ``We're looking to normalize everything and keep police presenceas unobtrusive as possible,'' he said.   Police surrounded the neighborhood today and allowed only thosewith legitimate business into the area, said a police spokesman,Officer Angelo Bitsis. Schools in the neighborhood were closed.   In the only incident of violence reported by police Tuesdayafternoon, a white man driving through the Overtown area reportedlybegan shooting into a crowd of blacks, injuring one person beforedriving away.   The riot erupted on the night of the federal holiday for slaincivil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and as national attentionwas focused on the city as the host of Sunday's Super Bowl. It alsorekindled memories of Miami riots in the early 1980s.   ``It just exploded,'' said City Commissioner Rosario Kennedy asshe prepared to enter the 1{-square-mile area with a police escort.``People have been celebrating Martin Luther King's birthday allday. Maybe they were drunk. We just don't know.''   The riot began about 8 p.m., about two hours after the death ofmotorcyclist Clement Lloyd. Lloyd, 21, was shot in the head as hewas being chased for an alleged traffic violation, said Sgt. MichaelMazur, another police spokesman.   Police Sgt. David Rivero said the department was investigatingunsubstantiated reports that the men may have been involved in arobbery.   At least two officers were pursuing the motorcyclist for allegederratic driving when they passed a third officer, William Lozano,who was stopped by the side of the road in an unrelated incident,police said.   Lozano, who is white, shot Lloyd as the motorcycle came towardhim, said Assistant Police Chief Don March.   The motorcycle crashed into a moving car, seriously injuringLloyd's 24-year-old brother, who was a passenger. The brother, whosename was not immediately released, was in critical condition today,according to Jackson Memorial Hospital officials.   Police said Lozano was temporarily taken off duty.   The Dade County Medical Examiner's office issued a statementtoday confirming that Lloyd was killed by the gunshot, not by thecrash.   Within minutes of the shooting, at least 100 blacks beganthrowing rocks and bottles at police, who called for reinforcements.About 125 officers cordoned off the area, authorities said.   Four people, including one police officer, were treated for cutsand minor injuries, said Jackson Hospital spokesman Tony Fallon.   At one point, the Miami Herald reported, Suarez approached thecrowd in an effort at concilation but was driven back by rocks andbottles.   An auto parts store was burned to the ground after firefighterswere shot at and had to leave the area, Mazur said.   During the height of the violence, tear gas was used to dispersesome crowds, who attacked and burned several clearly marked newsmedia cars.   WCIX-TV reporter Lourdes Ruiz-Toledo said she feared for her life.   ``All of a sudden they threw a big huge rock right on the side ofthe driver. I blocked it with my elbow. They were yelling `Get thatwhite woman out of the car!''' the 27-year-old reporter said.   Miss Ruiz-Toledo, who had stayed in her car while two colleaguesgot out, said she drove a block and was rescued by an officer wholed her from the car behind a plastic riot shield. The car was laterburned.   A woman driving home from work said her windshield was shatteredby a 5-pound concrete block.   ``I had no idea it was going on,'' said Kay Worthington of MiamiBeach. ``There were about 20 kids all throwing things. I didn't seeany cops around there.''   Some blacks say they have been frustrated since Miami officialsbegan providing free shelter for about 250 Nicaraguans seekingpolitical asylum.   ``They feel that other folks are being recognized and getting apiece of the pie but things are different for them. They feel theydon't have nothing and what do they have to lose?'' said PrestonMarshall, who had organized a parade in King's honor that drew anestimated 100,000 people of all races in nearby Liberty City.   ``Of all days, I didn't want this to happen,'' said Marshall, whowas among black community leaders called in by city officials tohelp calm the crowd.   No damage estimates were available. Some looting and gunfirecontinued in Overtown early today.   During three days of rioting in Overtown in 1982, arsoniststorched buildings and mobs broke into stores, causing millions ofdollars of damage. The riot was sparked by the fatal shooting of ablack man by a Cuban-born police officer.   The officer was acquitted of manslaughter charges in March 1984,sparking another disturbance that resulted in more than 200 arrestsand several injuries. A police internal affairs report in 1985concluded that the officer was justified in using deadly force.   In 1980, racial violence in Liberty City left 18 people dead, 400injured and $100 million in damage. That rioting occurred after anall-white jury acquitted several police officers of manslaughter inthe beating death of a black businessman.   The scene of Monday's disturbance was about 15 miles from JoeRobbie Stadium in north Dade County, the site of the Super Bowl. Butthe Cincinnati Bengals are staying less than a mile away at the OmniHotel.   The Miami Arena, where the Miami Heat of the National BasketballAssociation has a game scheduled for tonight, is on the edge ofOvertown.</TEXT></DOC>
