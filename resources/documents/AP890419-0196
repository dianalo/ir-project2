In Rangoon, a grenade exploded Wednesday outside the home of anopposition leader, injuring two teen-agers, witnesses said.   At a news conference, Col. Than Tun said 177 governmentsoldiers, including some officers, were killed and 377 were woundedin the battle for the Maela camp.   The bodies of 466 guerrillas were counted but he said more than600 were killed during the offensive.   Maela, near the Thai border, was regarded as one of the twomajor Karen strongholds. The other, Maw Poh Kay, fell to governmentforces March 26.   The colonel claimed the government victory broke the backbone ofthe Karen insurgency, which began in 1949, a year after Burmaachieved independence from Britain.   Thai police officers and Karens who fled the base also reportedits seizure but gave much lower casualty figures.   The Karens said Wednesday about 40 camp defenders were killed,including 10 students who joined the rebels after fleeing lastyear's government crackdown on the student-led protests fordemocracy.   They said 180 to 200 government troops were killed.   The base is 135 miles northeast of the capital, Rangoon.   Than Tun said government forces fought 66 major engagements withthe rebels since operations against Maela began Feb. 18. TheKarens, an ethnic minority, charged the government has reneged onpromises of greater regional autonomy.   The Karens are allied with nine other guerrilla groups in theNational Democratic Front, which claims to field 35,000 fightersand control half the country.   In Rangoon, a hand grenade exploded 20 yards from the house ofopposition leader Aung Gyi, witnesses said. They said it injuredtwo 16-year-old boys who found the grenade while playing in frontof the house.   The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said theexplosion damaged the walls of a nearby house. Aung Gyi was not athome at the time.   Aung Gyi was one of the original leaders of the leadingopposition party, The National League For Democracy. But he wasremoved from the party when he asked another leader, Aung San SuuKyi, to expel communists from her faction.   Aung Gyi later formed his own party to contest an election thatmilitary authorities have promised to hold next year.</TEXT></DOC>
