KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   House Democrats are urging President Bush toboost by 100,000 the number of East European refugees allowed toenter the United States over the next 12 months.   A letter to Bush signed by House Majority Leader RichardGephardt, D-Mo., and Rep. William O. Lipinski, D-Ill., said thatwhile the Iron Curtain has begun to open to permit people to leave,an American bureaucratic curtain keeps most of them from coming tothe United States.   ``Unfortunately, the gates to America for those who have sufferedunder communist regimes are closed,'' Gephardt and Lipinski said.   While immigration policy favoring family reunification and jobskills is generally correct, ``it has prevented American policy fromreacting to the increase in emigration from Eastern Europe,'' theysaid in the letter released Thursday.   Restrictions on emigration are being eased by the Soviet Unionand other Eastern European nations, but immigration to the UnitedStates from the region decreased from 27,480 in 1982 to 12,838 in1987, they said.   The Bush administration has resisted increasing refugee totals,with some officials contending that the United States can no longeraccommodate the large numbers of people wishing to immigrate. The1989 immigration ceiling for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is31,500 and has been filled.   ``Ongoing suppression and persecution in these communistcountries justifies America's acceptance of Eastern European andSoviet refugees,'' the letter said.   Ronald H. Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee,endorsed the move to increase the flow of refugees from EasternEurope to the United States.   ``The president ought to use his authority to help the thousandsof people that have already fled communist regimes in the SovietUnion and Eastern Europe,'' Brown said in a statement. ``Hisleadership on this initiative is critical.''</TEXT></DOC>
