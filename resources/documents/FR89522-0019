Background</ITAG>The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, Pub. L. 95-87,30 U.S.C. 1201 <T3>et seq</T3>., provides statutory authority for the development of regulationsfor surface coal mining operations. Section 710(d) requires compliance``[o]n and after thirty months from the enactment of this Act,'' with requirementsat least as stringent as those imposed by sections 507, 508, 509, 510,515, 516, 517, and 519 of SMCRA, for all surface coal mining operationson Indian lands. It also directs the Secretary of the Interior to incorporatethe requirements of such provisions in all existing and new leases issuedfor coal on Indian lands. Section 710(e) further requires the Secretaryto include and enforce in all post-SMCRA leases of coal on Indian lands,such terms and conditions as may be requested by the Indian tribe in suchleases.On September 28, 1984, the Secretary issued a final rule implementing therequirements of sections 710(d) and 710(e) of SMCRA (49 FR 38462). A newsubchapter, Subchapter E_Indian Lands Program, was added to 30 CFR ChapterVII and included Part 750_Requirements For Surface Coal Mining And ReclamationOperations On Indian Lands, and Part 755_Tribal-Federal IntergovernmentalAgreements.The final Indian lands rules were subsequently challenged by the Stateof New Mexico (<T3>New Mexico </T3>v. <T3>DOI</T3>, Civil No. 84-3572 (D.D.C.)), (hereafter, ``<T3>New Mexico</T3>'') and the National Coal Association/American MiningCongress (NCA/AMC) (<T3>NCA </T3>v. <T3>DOI</T3>, Civil No. 84-3586 (D.D.C.)), (hereafter, ``<T3>NCA/AMC</T3>''). Both challenges were settled in U.S. District Courtin August 1985 under separate agreements in which OSMRE agreed to undertakecertain rulemaking actions concerning the Federal program for Indian lands.On August 21, 1987, OSMRE published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> suspending the final rule at 30 CFR 750.20(a)pursuant to the <T3>NCA/AMC</T3> settlement agreement (52 FR 31621).On February 10, 1988, OSMRE published a proposed rule to clarify and amendthe preamble and regulations for the Indian lands program in accordancewith the terms of the <T3>New Mexico</T3> and <T3>NCA/AMC</T3> agreements (53 FR 3992). The notice announced a 60-daycomment period ending on April 20, 1988, and public hearings to be heldupon request in Washington, DC and Denver, Colorado. A public hearing wasrequested and held in Denver on April 13, 1988, during which OSMRE receivedrequests for an extension of the public comment period. The comment periodon the proposed rule was reopened until May 12, 1988, in response to therequests received at the public hearing. The notice reopening the publiccomment period was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 27, 1988 (53 FR 15064).<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Discussion of Final Rule and Response to Public Comments on ProposedRule</ITAG>During the comment period, OSMRE received comments from three Indian tribes,an energy resource tribal organization, a national coal industry tradeorganization, and a coal company. OSMRE has reviewed each comment carefullyand has considered the commenters' suggestions and remarks in preparingthe final rule.Many of the comments received were general in nature and others went beyondthe scope of the proposed rulemaking. These general comments and concernsare addressed in the section that follows. Comments of a more specificnature on the proposed rule are discussed in the section-by-section analysisportion of the preamble.A. General CommentsOSMRE published the proposed rule pursuant to the provisions of the <T3>NCA/AMC</T3> and <T3>New Mexico</T3> settlement agreements. One commenter expressed supportfor the rules as proposed and urged OSMRE to move forward expeditiouslywith the final rule.Several commenters contended that the Secretary failed to consult withthe Indian tribes prior to entering into the settlement agreements in <T3>New Mexico</T3> and <T3>NCA/AMC</T3> and variously maintained that the agreements and the proposedregulations are violative of Federal law including SMCRA, Federal policypromoting tribal self-government, Federal fiduciary and trust responsibilities,tribal sovereignty, and the tribes' right to due process. One commenterrecommended that, if necessary, OSMRE should move to vacate or modify theagreements so that they comport with Federal law. Another commenter opposedthe proposed regulations as an effort to circumvent tribal aspirationsto regulate mining activities on their lands and recommended renewed effortsby the Secretary to develop enabling legislation, pursuant to section 710of SMCRA, authorizing tribal assumption of primacy. This commenter furtherrecommended that OSMRE meet with other DOI agencies to examine, as a whole,legislation and Congressional intent regarding tribal sovereignty and self-determination.Another commenter contended that promulgation of the final rule would onlyresult in further litigation and recommended alternatively that OSMRE meetwith the affected tribes, companies, and States to discuss, and attemptto resolve, the issues of concern. One tribal commenter posed a seriesof questions regarding OSMRE's consultations with the tribe and industry,and within DOI, during settlement negotiations and the rulemaking process.OSMRE considers those comments which address the propriety of the mannerin which the Secretary entered the settlement agreements, or the substanceof the settlement agreements, irrelevant to this rulemaking, in that theydo not specifically discuss the merits of the proposal itself. Similarly,comments which address efforts to develop legislation pursuant to section710 are beyond the scope of this rulemaking. This rulemaking is consistentwith SMCRA and other applicable Federal law and does not affect existingFederal law or policy regarding tribal self-government, Federal fiduciaryand trust responsibilities, tribal sovereignty, and the tribes' right todue process. The commenter's belief that promulgation of this rule mightresult in litigation does not address the merits of the rulemaking andis not an appropriate factor to be considered in development of the finalrule.Two commenters raised issues concerning the jurisdictional status of theCrow Ceded Area in Montana and asserted their views regarding tribal authorityto regulate on tribal lands. One of the commenters expressed oppositionto OSMRE's settlement agreement with the State of Montana and WestmorelandResources, Inc., regarding regulation of surface coal mining on the CrowCeded Area.As stated herein, OSMRE is the exclusive regulatory authority on Indianlands under SMCRA. Review of the complex issues surrounding the jurisdictionalstatus of the Crow Ceded Area and the settlement agreement referenced bythe commenter are more properly dealt with under the terms of the settlementagreement and Memorandum of Understanding.Another commenter posed a question regarding the future of Title V fundingfor the tribes, with or without adoption of the proposed regulations.OSMRE considers this comment beyond the scope of this rulemaking.B. Clarification and Comments <ITAG tagnum="81">Clarification of Regulatory Authority on Indian Lands </ITAG>The rule at 30 CFR 750.6(a) designates OSMRE as the regulatory authorityon Indian lands. Pursuant to the <T3>New Mexico </T3>and <T3>NCA/AMC </T3>settlements, OSMRE published a proposed clarificationof this rule stating that OSMRE is, and will remain, the sole regulatoryauthority of surface coal mining operations on Indian lands in Arizonaand New Mexico until legislation is enacted authorizing Indian tribes toassume regulatory primacy and the tribes elect to do so. Three commenters objected to the proposed clarification as inconsistentwith the Indian tribes' inherent sovereign power to regulate activitieson lands under their jurisdiction, citing Federal Indian law, Federal policypromoting tribal self-government, and various court decisions to supporttheir position. Two of the commenters also cited section 710(h) of SMCRA(30 U.S.C. section 1300(h)), wherein it states that ``nothing in this Actshall change the existing jurisdictional status of Indian Lands,'' as confirmationof Congressional intent to preserve tribal governmental authority to regulatesurface mining activities on tribal lands. OSMRE disagrees in part. Pending Congressional enactment of additionallegislation pursuant to section 710(a) of SMCRA, OSMRE interprets SMCRAto provide that the Indian tribes are not authorized by SMCRA to act asthe regulatory authority for surface coal mining on Indian lands concerningmatters which are regulated under SMCRA. This rulemaking does not discussor affect the extent to which the Indian tribes may have residual or inherentauthority to regulate any aspect or impacts of surface coal mining operations.Whether such authority exists is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. Amore detailed discussion of the Secretary's regulatory authority on Indianlands can be found in the preamble to the September 28, 1984, final Indianlands rule (49 FR 38462 <T3>et seq.</T3>). OSMRE also rejects the commenters' interpretation of section 710(h) ofSMCRA. Section 710(a) mandates the enactment of enabling legislation asa prerequisite to tribal assumption of full regulatory authority underthe Act. OSMRE does not interpret section 710(h) as impairing the Secretary'sauthority to act as regulatory authority for surface coal mining operationson Indian lands and to implement the requirements of sections 710 (c),(d), (e), and (f). One commenter objected to the proposal on the grounds that it would precludeOSMRE from delegating SMCRA responsibilities to Indian tribes until andunless section 710 legislation is adopted, and suggested that the tribescould assume concurrent regulatory jurisdiction with OSMRE without enactmentof such legislation. Another commenter suggested that the Indian tribescould regulate surface coal mining activities on their lands through contractualarrangements with the Secretary. OSMRE disagrees that section 710 legislation is unnecessary for tribalassumption of surface mining regulatory duties, for the reasons statedearlier in this preamble that section 710(a) specifically requires theenactment of enabling legislation for the assumption of tribal regulatoryauthority under SMCRA concerning surface coal mining operations on Indianlands. Furthermore, section 710 does not authorize delegation of the Secretary'sregulatory authority under SMCRA concerning Indian lands. OSMRE notes thatthis position is supported by the fact that Congress found it necessaryto enact specific legislation authorizing the tribes to assume Title IVfunctions under SMCRA. (Pub. L. 100-71, 30 U.S.C. 1235, as amended.) Becauseof the wide range of regulatory responsibilities under Title V, it is reasonableto assume that Congress would find it even more necessary to enact specificlegislation authorizing the tribes to assume regulatory functions underTitle V of SMCRA. This rulemaking does not address the question of whatOSMRE might do if other appropriate legislation were to authorize suchdelegation, in whole or in part. OSMRE therefore does not consider thisrulemaking action the proper forum for discussing the plausibility andmerits of the potential regulatory arrangements posed by the commenters.One of the commenters objected to the proposed clarification as discriminatoryunder the Fifth Amendment, claiming that the designation of OSMRE as thesole regulatory authority only in the States of Arizona and New Mexicointentionally targeted specific Indian tribes for adverse treatment. Thiscommenter also questioned the origin of, and basis for, the proposal. OSMRE disagrees that this action is discriminatory in intent or in effect.The clarification is intended to resolve any ambiguity regarding surfacemining regulatory jurisdiction on Indian lands in the two States wherethis question has been specifically at issue in the <T3>New Mexico </T3>and <T3>NCA/AMC </T3>challenges, namely Arizona and New Mexico. OSMRE doesacknowledge, however, that the clarification could be misinterpreted bythe public as confining the agency's regulatory jurisdiction on Indianlands exclusively to those two States and hereby further clarifies thatOSMRE's exclusive regulatory authority extends to all surface coal miningoperations, or portions thereof, located on Indian lands as defined insection 701 of SMCRA. OSMRE's regulatory jurisdiction on Indian lands isbased on and authorized by section 710 of SMCRA. One commenter opposed the proposed clarification as incongruent with tribaland agency efforts to develop tribal capabilities to regulate surface coalmining operations on their lands, citing OSMRE's own findings regardingthe partial regulatory abilities of two of the coal-producing tribes asevidence of the progress and success of such efforts. (It should be notedthat the findings cited by the commenter are contained in an OSMRE reportentitled <T3>Study On Tribal Capability To Assume Regulatory Primacy </T3>whichwas released in final form in February 1988. The report examined and evaluatedthe capabilities of the three coal-producing tribes [Crow, Hopi, and Navajo]to assume potential or hypothetical surface coal mining regulatory dutieson Indian lands, in order to determine the success and future directionof Title V funding cooperative agreements with the three tribes.) Thiscommenter further contended that the proposal was neither required by law,nor compatible with the Administration's Indian policy. Another commentermaintained that OSMRE had overlooked the intent of legislation such asthe Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, 25U.S.C. 450 <T3>et seq., </T3>in developing agency regulations and policy, and thatthe Secretary had violated the self-determination policy by negotiatingand entering into settlement agreements ``that affect the Tribe's vitalinterests on surface mining.'' OSMRE disagrees with these comments. Regardless of the tribes' abilitiesto regulate surface coal mining activities on their lands, and regardlessof previous or ongoing efforts to develop those abilities, OSMRE is andwill continue to be the sole regulatory authority on Indian lands pendingenactment of section 710 legislation and tribal assumption of primacy.Section 710 requires the Secretary to ensure compliance with SMCRA on Indianlands. Consistent with this mandate, the clarification emphasizes thatOSMRE is the sole designated regulatory authority on Indian lands. OSMRErecognizes that greater tribal self-determination is an important policygoal of the Department and this Administration consistent with the provisionsof the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended.However, the attainment of that goal must be compatible with the existingstatutory requirements governing mineral development on Indian lands, includingthe Secretary's obligation under section 710 of SMCRA to regulate surfacecoal mining operations on such lands. OSMRE notes that the Indian Self-Determinationand Education Assistance Act was recently amended by the Indian Self-Determinationand Education Assistance Act Amendments of 1988, Pub. L. 100-472, but considersthe implementation and interpretation of that legislation outside the scopeof this rulemaking. One commenter opposed the designation of OSMRE as the sole regulatory authorityon Indian lands on the grounds that it would exclude the tribes from theregulatory process and could deprive them of the ability to impose revenue-generatingtaxes on surface coal mining activities conducted on reservation lands.OSMRE disagrees with this comment. As the regulatory authority on Indianlands, OSMRE is required by its own regulations at 30 CFR Part 750 to includethe affected Indian tribes in the permitting and inspection and enforcementprocesses. OSMRE must consult with the affected tribe regarding specialrequirements relating to the protection of non-coal resources of the areaaffected by surface coal mining and reclamation operations, and assureoperator compliance with such special requirements, pursuant to 30 CFR750.6. The regulations at 30 CFR 750.18 provide for tribal participationin the inspection and enforcement process on Indian lands. Clarifying theOSMRE is the SMCRA regulatory authority on Indian lands in no way affectsthe tribes' authority to levy taxes on coal mining operations located onlands under their jurisdiction. <ITAG tagnum="81">Clarification of Jurisdictional Status of Allotted Lands </ITAG>The February 10, 1988, proposed rulemaking included a clarification regardingthe jurisdictional status of individual Indian allotments located outsidethe boundaries of Federal Indian reservations. The clarification was publishedpursuant to the <T3>New Mexico </T3>and <T3>NCA/AMC </T3>settlement agreements to amend a misstatement containedin the September 28, 1984, preamble to 30 CFR Part 750 wherein the applicabilityof the Federal program for Indian lands was described as including ``alllands within the exterior boundaries of Indian reservations, <T3>allotted lands,</T3> and all lands where either the surface or mineralsare held in trust for or supervised by an Indian tribe or individual Indians''(emphasis added) (49 FR 38463). As explained in the preamble to the February 10, 1988, proposed rule, theinclusion of lands outside the reservation and not held in trust for orsupervised by an Indian tribe was unintentional and was subsequently recognizedby OSMRE to exceed the scope of the statutory definition of ``Indian lands''in section 701(9) of SMCRA. Thus, OSMRE wishes to clarify that for purposesof surface coal mining regulatory jurisdiction, off-reservation allottedlands are include in the SMCRA definition of Indian lands only if an interestin the surface or mineral estate is held in trust for or supervised byan Indian tribe. Two commenters maintained that OSMRE should await the outcome of pendinglitigation involving jurisdictional issues on Indian lands before publishinga final clarification regarding surface coal mining regulatory jurisdictionon trust allotments. One of the commenters specifically cited two cases(<T3>Energy and Minerals Dept. </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Dept. of the Interior</T3>, 820 F.2d 441 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (hereafter,``<T3>Energy and Minerals</T3>'') which was remanded in part to the DistrictCourt for the District of New Mexico; and <T3>Pittsburgh andamp; Midway Coal Mining Co. </T3>v. <T3>OSMRE and Navajo Tribe</T3>, IBLA No. 87-577, (hereafter, ``<T3>Pittsburgh andamp; Midway</T3>'', which is fully briefed and awaitinga decision by the Interior Board of Land Appeals), and contened that ``theissue of whether any allotments held in trust for either tribes or individualIndians can be excluded from `Indian lands' is squarely at issue'' in thosetwo cases. OSMRE disagrees that the final clarification should be indefinitely delayedpending the issuance of final administrative or court decisions in thereferenced case. The <T3>Energy and Minerals </T3>case concerns a reservation boundary dispute,and does not involve interpretation of SMCRA. The clarification is fullyconsistent with the position taken by OSMRE in the <T3>Pittsburgh andamp; Midway </T3>case as to what constitutes Indian landsfor purposes of surface coal mining regulation, and is also consistentwith the statutory definition of ``Indian lands'' at section 701(9) ofSMCRA. Furthermore, the clarification is necessary to resolve any remainingambiguity concerning the applicability of the Federal program for Indianlands to individual Indian allotments that may have resulted from the inaccuratestatement contained in the 1984 premable to 30 CFR Part 750. OSMRE believesthat it is more appropriate that this jurisdictional issue be addressedby rulemaking, which provides opportunity for widespread public participationand the fullest practical discussion of issues, rather than by quasi-judicialproceedings in which only parties and intervenors have standing and whichapply only to the lands and facts at issue in the proceeding. This rulemakingis intended in part to provide guidance to IBLA concerning the applicationand interpretation of the SMCRA definition of Indian lands. Two commenters opposed the clarification, alleging that, if adopted, theclarification would unlawfully allow State regulation on Indian trust allotments.One of the commenters cited section 710(h) of SMCRA, which states ``[t]hatnothing in this Act shall change the existing jurisdictional status ofIndian Lands,'' as clear evidence of Congressional intent to preclude Statecontrol of Indians and Indian lands. The commenter further cited the decisionrendered in <T3>Montana v. Clark </T3>(749 F.2d 740 (D.C. Cir. 1958), cert. den. 474U.S. 919 (1985)), (hereafter, ``<T3>Montana</T3>'') as evidence that trust allotments must be consideredas Indian lands under SMCRA. <T3>Montana </T3>involved a challenge to OSMRE's regulations at 30 CFR872.11(b)(3), which implement the provisions of section 402(g) of SMCRAconcerning the allocation of abandoned mine land monies collected in Statesand Indian reservations. The commenter maintained that the <T3>Montana</T3> court, in upholding the substitution of the term ``Indianlands'' for ``Indian reservation'' in the challenged regulation, equatedthe term ``Indian lands'' with all lands in which Indians have an interest.Thus, the commenter reasoned that off-reservation trust allotments plainlyqualify as Indian lands.OSMRE disagrees that the clarification would unlawfully allow State regulationof surface coal mining operations on Indian allotments. Section 710 appliesto ``Indian lands,'' and given the definition of Indian lands at section701(9), is applicable to lands owned by or held in trust for individualIndians only if an interest in those lands is also held in trust for orsupervised by an Indian tribe. SMCRA does not preclude State regulationof surface coal mining operations located on off-reservation individualtrust allotments if those allotments are not held in trust for or supervisedby a tribe, because such allotments would not be considered Indian landsunder the Act.OSMRE disagrees with the commenter's interpretation of the <T3>Montana</T3> decision and views it as a misconstrued reading of thecourt's holding. The commenter claims that the court, in reaching its decision,equated the term ``Indian lands'' with the phrase ``all lands in whichIndians have an interest.'' This is not correct. In examining the legislativehistory of SMCRA, the court found ``overwhelming evidence'' of Congressionalintent to temporarily ``<T3>postpone determining the locus of regulatory authority</T3> over alllands in which Indians have an interest.'' <T3>Montana </T3>v. <T3>Clark, supra, </T3>749 F.2d at 752 (emphasis added). The court explicitlyrecognized that an exhaustive treatment of SMCRA jurisdiction for the varietyof off-reservation land ownership patterns involving Indian interests wasintentionally set aside by Congress for future consideration. The courtdid not address the issue of whether off-reservation trust allotments areIndian lands for purposes of SMCRA regulation.One commenter maintained that all lands allotted to members of a specifiedtribe must be considered ``Indian lands'' pursuant to SMCRA for severaladditional reasons. The commenter gave incomplete or incorrect citationsto State statutory provisions and cited several court cases for the propositionthat both New Mexico and Arizona have expressly disclaimed all jurisdictionover such trust lands. The commenter further maintained that ``as a purelyfactual matter,'' all such allotments are and have been supervised by thetribe, and that the tribe is acquiring and will continue to acquire interestsin the allotments under the amended Indian Land Consolidation Act, 25 U.S.C.2201 <T3>et seq</T3>. Finally, the commenter stated that thousands of such allotmentsare within reservation boundaries and/or are categorized by BIA as ``reservationallotments.''OSMRE considers the comment regarding the States' complete renunciationof jurisdiction over all trust allotments as unsupported and irrelevantto the merits of this rulemaking. None of the materials which were citedwith sufficient specificity that they could be located, supported the citedproposition. All of the referenced State cases concerned reservation lands,which are included in the SMCRA definition of Indian lands. Therefore,none of these cases support the comment insofar as it refers to lands notincluded in the SMCRA definition. Even if such renunciation by a Statehad taken place, other procedures for dealing with any such hypotheticalsituation are set forth in 30 CFR, including parts 732, 733, and 736. Renunciation<T3>per se</T3> could not serve as a basis for treating such lands as Indianlands.OSMRE also has no evidence to support the commenter's assertion that allindividual Indian allotments are and have been supervised by the tribe,nor has the commenter provided any information supporting this statement.However, OSMRE recognizes that tribal supervision of allotments may beshown to exist in some cases, and the clarification is consistent withthat premise. The determination of tribal supervision over off-reservationlands will be made on a case-by-case basis.Finally, the commenter's claim that many allotments are within reservationboundaries and/or categorized as ``reservation allotments'' is vague andunclear. OSMRE has consistently interpreted and continues to interpretSMCRA section 701(9) to provide that any lands located within the recognizedboundaries of a Federal Indian reservation are Indian lands under SMCRA.The commenter provides no information as to the number, extent, or geographiclocation of ``reservation allotments'' which are located outside the recognizedboundaries of Federal Indian reservations, nor is the term ``reservationallotments'' defined or described. Thus, any attempt by OSMRE to determinethe validity or relevance of this comment would be purely speculative.One commenter objected to the clarification on the grounds that it ``suggeststhat any mineral interests underlying tribal trust surface ownership wouldbe subject to tribal surface regulation,'' and that it does not explainthe meaning of the phrase ``supervised by'' [an Indian tribe] as that termis used in SMCRA and the implementing regulations. The commenter recommendedthat OSMRE limit the definition of ``Indian lands'' to ``recognized reservationlands and those lands held in trust for a tribe by the United States thatdo not overlie non-Indian ownership of minerals,'' and exclude any feelands, including split estates. The commenter maintained that, absent expressFederal delegation, Indian tribes lack inherent authority to regulate activitiesoutside reservation boundaries, including the assertion of SMCRA regulatoryjurisdiction over off-reservation fee lands. The commenter apprised OSMREof pending litigation challenging tribal jurisdiction for taxation purposesin off-reservation areas, and suggested that OSMRE consider the consequencesof the clarification in light of a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) landexchange proposal designed to consolidate tribal trust lands in New Mexico.The commenter contended that defining ``Indian lands'' so as to subjectprivate fee minerals to eventual Indian regulatory control might constitutea ``taking without compensation.'' Finally, as a matter of information,the commenter cited pending litigation involving tribal claims that certainlands located outside the tribe's recognized reservation boundaries arepart of the reservation proper (<T3>Blatchford </T3>v. <T3>Sullivan</T3>, Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals Case No. 87-1547), (hereafter,``<T3>Blatchford</T3>'').OSMRE rejects the commenter's proposed definition of ``Indian lands'' asoverly restrictive and inconsistent with SMCRA. With respect to off-reservationareas, the statutory definition at section 701(9) of SMCRA includes ``alllands including mineral interests held in trust for or supervised by anIndian tribe.'' It is OSMRE's position that the SMCRA definition encompassesnot only the unsevered tribal trust estates included in the commenter'sproposed definition, but also severed tribal trust lands, and lands supervisedby a tribe.OSMRE regards the comments concerning the ongoing legal challenges to tribalregulatory and taxation powers outside reservation boundaries, and concerningBLM's land exchange proposal, as irrelevant. This rulemaking does not encompasssuch issues or proposals, but merely seeks to clarify the geographic extentof OSMRE's regulatory jurisdiction under SMCRA concerning Indian lands.This clarification provides that off-reservation allotments are includedin the SMCRA definition of Indian lands only if an interest in the surfaceor mineral estate is held in trust for or supervised by an Indian tribe.The <T3>Blatchford</T3> case cited by the commenter involves the issue of whethera particular area is part of the Navajo Reservation. The resolution ofthat case would not affect this rulemaking since the case has nothing todo with allotments.OSMRE regards the comments concerning tribal surface regulation and possiblecompensable takings if the definition were applied by a hypothetical tribalregulatory authority at some unspecified future time, to be irrelevantto this rulemaking. The purpose of defining Indian lands is to clarifyhow this term will be applied by OSMRE as the sole regulatory authorityunder SMCRA. OSMRE cannot speculate as to when or under what specific legislativelanguage Indian tribes may eventually assume regulatory responsibilityif section 710(a) legislation is passed.OSMRE notes the comment that the meaning of the phrase ``supervised by''[an Indian tribe] should be clarified. However, a dispositive policy concerningthe concept of tribal supervision of individual trust allotments and otherforms of tribal interests in land would have to encompass a highly complexset of potential issues and fact patterns, and is beyond the scope andpurpose of this rulemaking. As stated earlier in this preamble, OSMRE willmake such determinations on a case-by-case basis if and when the need arises.C. Specific Regulatory Changes and Comments<ITAG tagnum="81">25 CFR Part 200</ITAG>Section 200.11 Incorporation of Coal Lease Termsand ConditionsIn the February 1988 rulemaking proposal, OSMRE proposed to amend the regulationsat 30 CFR 750.20 (a) and (b) concerning the incorporation of coal leaseterms and conditions on Indian lands. Upon review, it has been jointlydecided by OSMRE and BIA to transfer the rules from OSMRE's regulatoryprogram at 30 CFR Chapter VII to BIA's regulatory program at 25 CFR Chapter1, Subchapter I. The regulations at 25 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter I governleasing and development of energy and mineral resources on Indian landsand place primary responsibility for approval and management of prospectingand leasing activities with BIA. Thus, the recodification of the rulesimplements existing Departmental organization and performance of responsibilitiesconcerning Indian lands, because it reflects the lead role of BIA in theapproval and amendment of coal leases on Indian lands.In the proposed rule, the regulations at 30 CFR 750.20 (a) and (b) werecontained within a section entitled ``Incorporation of coal lease termsand conditions.'' The rules have been recodified within 25 CFR SubchapterI and a new part has been added as follows: Part 200_Terms and Conditions:Coal Leases. The rules have been redesignated as 25 CFR 200.11 (a) and(b) under the section heading ``Incorporation of coal lease terms and conditions.''The regulations at 25 CFR 200.11 (a) and (b) implement sections 710 (d)and (e) of SMCRA, respectively, wherein the Secretary is directed to incorporatethe requirements of the applicable provisions of SMCRA, and tribe-requestedterms and conditions, into leases of coal on Indian lands.Section 200.11(a)The rule at 25 CFR 200.11(a) (formerly 30 CFR 750.20(a)) provides for theincorporation of the SMCRA-compliance provision into existing and new leasesof coal on Indian lands at the time such leases are issued, renewed, renegotiated,or readjusted, as applicable.One tribal commenter maintained that deferring the inclusion of the proposedlease provision for existing leases until renewal, renegotiation, or readjustment,was contrary to law and Congressional intent in that it further delayedthe action beyond the thirty-month time limit specified in SMCRA. The commenterfurther claimed that the rule change was arbitrary and capricious on thegrounds that OSMRE had failed to explain why the new rule was preferableto the previous regulation. The commenter also contended that the rulechange constituted a violation of the Secretary's trust responsibilitysince neither OSMRE nor BIA had consulted with the tribe prior to enteringinto the settlement agreement where the proposed rule change was firstcontemplated. Finally, the commenter raised a question regarding the enforceabilityof SMCRA section 710(d) standards for existing Indian coal leases shouldthe rule change be implemented.OSMRE disagrees that the rule change is contrary to law and Congressionalintent. Section 710(d) of SMCRA provides that <T3>``[o]n and after thirty months</T3> from the enactment of this Act,all surface coal mining operations on Indian lands shall comply with requirementsat least as stringent as those imposed by [applicable provisions of SMCRA]and the Secretary shall incorporate the requirements of such provisionsin all existing and new leases issued for coal on Indian lands'' (emphasisadded). This language does not specify the mechanism by which the requirementis to be implemented with respect to new and existing leases. The Secretaryhas achieved the required result by applying these provisions by operationof law under 30 CFR Part 750 and, prior to the adoption of Part 750, underSMCRA itself, to all surface coal mining operations on Indian lands (30CFR 750.11, 750.12, 750.16). Thus, there has been no delay in applyingthe requirement to all existing operations involving coal leases on Indianlands. The new rule establishes an orderly and equitable process for implementingthe Secretary's obligations under section 710(d) to incorporate appropriateprovisions in both existing and new leases of coal on Indian lands. Althoughthe required result was already achieved by operation of law, the absencein the previous rule of such a process for incorporating the required provisionshad raised questions regarding the equitable impact of the provision andits effect on existing leases of coal on Indian lands. This rule is intendedto address those concerns.OSMRE disagrees with the commenter's assertions that proposal of the rulechange was arbitrary and capricious and violated the Secretary's trustresponsibilities. OSMRE proposed the rule change pursuant to the <T3>NCA/AMC</T3> settlement agreement, in response to objections raisedby the complainant concerning the unilateral amendment of existing leases.Non-parties to the agreement, though not involved in the settlement negotiations,were afforded ample opportunity to comment on the proposed rule changethrough the public comment process. Finally, the commenter's concern regarding the enforceability of section710(d) standards for existing leases pending incorporation of the SMCRA-complianceprovision into such leases is without merit. OSMRE addressed this issuein the preamble to the proposed rule wherein it stated that all surfacecoal mining operations on Indian lands are subject to the requirementsof section 710 of SMCRA and 30 CFR Part 750 by operation of law. This holdstrue regardless of whether the leases associated with such operations havebeen amended to include the SMCRA-compliance provision mandated by section710(d). Section 200.11(b) The rule adopted today at 25 CFR 200.11(b) (formerly 30 CFR 750.20(b))provides for the incorporation of SMCRA-related terms and conditions, asrequested in writing by the lessor Indian tribe, into post-SMCRA leasesof coal on Indian lands. The rule specifies that these terms and conditionsshall be included when such leases are issued, renewed, renegotiated, orreadjusted, as applicable. One commenter objected to the proposed rule change at 25 CFR 200.11(b)as contrary to SMCRA in that it would limit the scope of tribe-requestedterms and conditions to SMCRA-related concerns and would allow their incorporationinto existing leases only at the time of lease renewal, renegotiation,or readjustment. OSMRE disagrees that the rule change is contrary to SMCRA. Although section710(e) does not specifically state that tribe-requested terms and conditionsbe related to SMCRA, OSMRE believes that section 710(e) was not intendedto encompass terms and conditions unrelated to SMCRA, since the mechanismsfor incorporating other terms and conditions were in place prior to theenactment of SMCRA. The requirement that section 710(e) terms and conditionsbe incorporated into existing leases only at specific, predetermined timesis beneficial in that it minimizes the likelihood of frequent and unpredictableamendments to existing agreements. OSMRE believes this is necessary toimplement section 710(e) in an orderly and reasonable manner with respectto existing contracts and leases. Moreover, the leasing and lease readjustmentprocesses are not the tribes' sole means of ensuring operator compliancewith special tribal requirements related to SMCRA. The rules at 30 CFR750.6 provide an opportunity for the tribes to advise OSMRE and BIA ofspecial requirements relating to the protection of non-coal resources ofthe area affected by surface coal mining and reclamation operations duringthe permitting process. As the regulatory authority on Indian lands, OSMREmust assure operator compliance with such special requirements. One commenter expressed concern that the revised rule could be misinterpretedas restricting lease readjustment solely to SMCRA-related purposes andrecommended that the rule be clarified accordingly. As a point of clarification, the implementation of the rule will in noway affect the tribes' ability to continue to request the inclusion ofnon-SMCRA-related terms and conditions in new and existing coal leaseson Indian lands pursuant to other existing statutes and regulations governingthe leasing process on such lands. One commenter maintained that the revised rule would give the lessee ``vetopower'' over the terms and conditions requested by a tribe, or would forcethe tribe to compromise on proposed lease amendments. OSMRE disagrees. Section 710(e) of SMCRA clearly empowers the Secretaryto incorporate tribe-requested terms and conditions into leases of coalon Indian lands, and the lessee must comply. One commenter contended that OSMRE breached its due process and fiduciarytrust responsibilities by failing to consult with the tribe prior to enteringinto the settlement agreement which contained the provision affecting thetribe's rights under section 710(e). OSMRE considers this comment beyond the scope of this rulemaking, becauseit concerns general legal and procedural issues relating to a previousaction by the Department, rather than the merits of the rule itself. OSMREreiterates that it has provided full opportunity to comment on the rulemakingimplementing the settlement, through the public comment process. The commenter further claimed that, by limiting the scope and time periodsfor incorporation of section 710(e) terms and conditions, OSMRE breachedits trust duty to assist the tribe in developing its powers of self-government,and impaired the tribe's ability to achieve its section 710(e) objectivesand maximize its economic benefits during the lease renegotiation and renewalprocess. OSMRE disagrees. The rule change does not affect the Department's commitmentto continued development of tribal self-governing powers, nor does it underminethe tribe's ability to negotiate leases for maximum economic gain. Allcoal lease terms and conditions on Indian lands, including those relatedto section 710 of SMCRA, are ultimately subject to Secretarial approval,thereby ensuring that tribal economic and environmental interests are protected.<ITAG tagnum="71">30 CFR Part 750 </ITAG>Section 750.12 Permit Applications Section 750.12(d)(2) describes the information that must be included inthe permit application package (PAP) for a surface coal mining operationon Indian lands in order to assure compliance with Federal laws other thanSMCRA. The rule at 30 CFR 750.12(d)(2)(v) is amended by deleting the referenceto the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA), 42 U.S.C. 1996, asa specific permit application information requirement. The final rule adopted today continues to require that the permit applicationcontain a description of compliance with Federal laws aimed at protectingcultural resources on Indian lands. The rule change does not eliminatethe need for AIRFA compliance for surface coal mining operations on Indianlands, but transfers the primary responsibility from the applicant to OSMRE.This is consistent with AIRFA provisions requiring the various Federaldepartments and agencies to implement policies and procedures to protectand preserve Native American religious cultural rights and practices. OSMREfulfills this obligation through the rule at 30 CFR 750.6(a)(4). That provisionrequires OSMRE to assure operator compliance with appropriate special requirementsrelating to the protection of non-coal resources of the area affected bysurface coal mining and reclamation operations, in consultation with BIAand the affected tribe. Two commenters objected to the proposed rule change. One commenter claimedthat the revised rule would eliminate the need for an applicant to dealdirectly with the affected tribes regarding the presence or absence ofcultural/religious sites and resources on the proposed permit area, andthat it would impose no obligation upon OSMRE to resolve AIRFA-relatedissues. Another commenter acknowledged that while AIRFA compliance is ultimatelya Federal responsibility, OSMRE should retain the option of requiring theproposed operator to conduct a survey of religious sites, claiming thatthe general requirements of 30 CFR 750.6(a)(4) are insufficient to ensureagency compliance with AIRFA. OSMRE disagrees with the commenters assertions that the existing rule at30 CFR 750.6(a)(4) is inadequate for purposes of AIRFA compliance and thatOSMRE is under no obligation to resolve AIRFA-related issues. The regulationat 30 CFR 750.6(a)(4) is broad in scope, providing for protection of allnon-coal resources on Indian lands without exception, including NativeAmerican religious sites and resources. The regulation further requiresOSMRE to assure operator compliance with special requirements relatingto the protection of such resources. This could include operator-conductedsurveys of religious sites, and could involve direct communications betweenthe operator and the affected tribe, as necessary to ensure compliancewith AIRFA. One commenter maintained that the rule change could jeopardize the confidentialityof Native American cultural/religious sites and resources by placing sensitiveinformation in the hands of government agencies subject to Freedom of InformationAct (FOIA) requests, and urged OSMRE to propose a new rule requiring theapplicant to address AIRFA-related issues in the PAP, in consultation withthe tribal land owners. OSMRE regards this comment as irrelevant to whether the proposal shouldbe adopted, because the same concern will exist under this rule or theprevious rule. The rule change merely reflects the fact that OSMRE, ratherthan the applicant, is ultimately responsible for ensuring AIRFA complianceon Indian lands. OSMRE recognizes the sensitive nature of AIRFA-relatedinformation and its significance to the Indian tribes. However, the determinationas to whether such information would be exempt from disclosure under FOIA,if it were submitted to OSMRE, is not affected by this rulemaking, andis properly addressed outside of this rulemaking action. <ITAG tagnum="84">III.
