Their combustion essentially contributes to air pollution widhall its health hazards and environmental impacts. Apart from the factthat power plants supplying energy with the help of nuclear fission aredisputed, uranium reserves are limited, too. The developmental stateof nuclear fusion, an the other hand, still defies concrete statementsas the future availability of fusion-based energy. Considering abovefacts it is evident that renewable energy sources will be gaining inimportance. The book above all intends to give a consistent survey onthe forms and capacities of renewable energy sources, existing technologiesand technologies currently being developed, historical aspects, the socialand environmental compatibility of renewable energy sources, economicaspects, and future prospects. The dictionary contains 197 independentalphabetically arranged and basically coherent chapters which are toprovide the basis for profound reflections on the subject.</TEXT></DOC>
