Review of past work historiessuggests that the excess of lung cancer in these short-term workers maybe accounted for by prior exposures rather than by exposures at the employmentunder investigation. The finding has significant implications in viewof the developing practice of including short-term workers in occupationalcohort studies in contrast to the more traditional practice of excludingshort-term workers. The traditional practice was based on the assumptionthat the inclusion of short-term workers with little exposure, and thuslittle risk, might dilute an otherwise apparent association between mortalityand exposure. This study suggests that in certain instances the inclusionof short-term workers may magnify rather than dilute the estimation ofrisk, reflecting the presence of confounding variables.</TEXT></DOC>
