Arlen Specter asked the InternalRevenue Service to begin an inquiry into possible violationsof U.S. anti-boycott laws by Baxter International Inc.   In a letter to IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg lastweek, the Pennsylvania Republican raised questions aboutwhether Baxter had cooperated illegally with the Arab boycottof Israel or failed to provide required information on taxforms about any Arab requests for participation in theboycott. A spokesman for the IRS, which is required under theInternal Revenue Code to help monitor companies' compliancewith U.S. anti-boycott law, declined to comment.</LP><TEXT>   A separate investigation by the Commerce Department intoBaxter's Middle Eastern activities is continuing, as is aninformal inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commissioninto whether Baxter may have violated anti-bribery laws inthe Middle East.   Meanwhile, an independent inquiry by the audit committeeof Baxter's board is expected to be completed by the end ofthe year. &quot;About the only thing I can tell you is that (theinvestigation) is ongoing,&quot; Stephen N. Shulman, a New Yorklawyer from the firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham andamp; Taft who isconducting the committee's inquiry, said in an interview. &quot;Iam trying to touch everything that might be relevant.&quot;   Investigators are looking into Baxter's removal in 1989from the Arab League's blacklist of corporations that dobusiness with Israel. Specifically, the government is tryingto determine whether Baxter's 1988 sale of an Israelisubsidiary was related to any violation of U.S. anti-boycottlaw or whether Baxter made any improper payments to winremoval from the blacklist. Jewish groups, including theAnti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and the AmericanJewish Congress, have raised questions about the sale.   Baxter has repeatedly and vigorously denied any wrongdoingin connection with its removal from the blacklist. Thehospital supplier cites a recent joint venture with theSyrian government to build an intravenous-fluids plant inSyria as the apparent reason for its being taken off thelist.   Officials of Premier Hospitals Alliance Inc., a nationwidecooperative of 45 teaching and research hospitals based inWestchester, Ill., met last month with Baxter representativesat the company's Deerfield, Ill., headquarters in connectionwith questions about Baxter's Middle Eastern activities,which were first reported in an article in The Wall StreetJournal May 1.   &quot;We are doing as we would in any case where a businesspartner is being investigated for illegal activities,&quot; said aspokeswoman for Premier, which handles group purchasing,among other things, for its members. Premier is conductingits own inquiry and awaiting the outcome of the governmentinvestigations before making any decisions on the matter, thespokeswoman said.</TEXT></DOC>
