The introduction is a blow to plans for a rival standard thatare being formulated by International Business Machines Corp.,Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.   Each group is trying to establish itself as the standard-setterfor Unix, an underlying layer of software that makes it easy fordifferent kinds of computers to run the same programs. Computerusers fear that if the two groups keep fighting there will be twoincompatible versions of Unix.   Unix International Inc., the group that includes ATandamp;T, said itwould gather 25 senior figures from the computing world onWednesday in New York to endorse the introduction of its UnixSystem 5 Release 4.0. The version unifies and enhances severalprevious Unix releases.   The group said shipments of the new software would begin earlynext year. That gives it a jump on the rival Open SoftwareFoundation, which is still hammering out standards and does notexpect to begin major shipments until late in 1990.   The two groups continued to bicker over how much support theyhave.   Unix International said its version of Unix was the successor tothe software on more than 80 percent of all currently installedUnix systems.   The Open Software Foundation countered that an independentsurvey by International Data Corp. found that its members andsponsors accounted for more shipments of Unix last year than theUnix International-affiliated companies.   ATandamp;T invented Unix but had to surrender control over itsdevelopment to Unix International to avoid abandonment of thestandard it created.</TEXT></DOC>
