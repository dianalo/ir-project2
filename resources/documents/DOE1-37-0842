When transmural convection was preventedby pressurization of the arteries with air, there was a decrease in sucrosespace (19% at 70 mmHg and 28% at 180 mmHg) and in albumin space (60%at 70 mmHg and 66% at 180 mmHg), compared with the respective spacesin relaxed arteries (0.42 for sucrose and 0.08 for albumin). Much smallerchanges were found when intact vessels were pressurized with liquid (insignificantfor sucrose, decreases of 24% at 70 mmHg and 14% at 180 mmHg for albumin).Removal of the endothelium, which increases transmural fluid flux, increasedthe space for sucrose (not significantly at 70 mmHg and 17% at 180 mmHg)and particularly for albumin (100% at 70 mmHg and 250% at 180 mmHg).We conclude that the interstitial volume and consequently the proteinspace within the media can be modified both by distending stresses appliedto the vessel and by transmural fluid flux.</TEXT></DOC>
