Police said one guerrilla was killed and four werewounded.   Police said four F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers carried out the10-minute raid, firing 10 rockets into the bases manned bySyrian-backed guerrillas of Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for theLiberation of Palestine-General Command.   Six rockets hit a base in the village of Sultan Yaaqoub, fourmiles west of the Syrian frontier in the Bekaa Valley of eastLebanon.   Three guerrillas, including the base commander known by the nomde guerre of Abu Murad, were wounded, police reported.   The other four rockets demolished a base in Deir Zanoun, fourmiles to the south, killing one guerrilla and wounding another,said a police spokesman who cannot be named under standingregulations.   Both bases are north of Israel's self-designated ``securityzone,'' an occupied border strip in south Lebanon. It was set up bythe Israelis in 1985 as a buffer against guerrilla raids.   The Israeli military command said in a brief communique inJerusalem that its planes destroyed one target serving as anoperational base and heaquarters for the guerrilla group. It saidthe jets all returned safely.   The group has been blamed by Western Intelligence agencies forbombing a New York-bound Pan American jumbo jet over Scotland inDecember, killing 270 people. Jibril has denied his group wasinvolved.   The radical faction is fiercely opposed to Palestine LiberationOrganization Chairman Yasser Arafat's peace overtures toward Israel.   Witnesses in the Bekaa said smoke billowed from both guerrillabases after the attack, which came a day after Lebanese PresidentRene Mouawad was assassinated in Moslem west Beirut. Israeliofficials issued statements warning Lebanese and Palestinianguerrilla organizations not to take advantage of the turmoil inLebanon to launch attacks on Israel.   Police said Syrian batteries of surface-to-air missiles in theBekaa and along the border did not fire on the raiding jets. ``TheSyrians did not interfere in the confrontation at all,'' thespokesman said.   Witnesses reached by telephone in the Bekaa said Jibril'sguerrillas opened up with twin-barreled, anti-aircraft guns, but nohits were observed.   The Israeli jets released scarlet balloons to deflectheat-seeking missiles, but none was fired, witnesses said.   Minutes after the raid, two Israeli jets streaked over Beirut,causing sonic booms as they broke the sound barrier and drawinganti-aircraft fire from militia gunners around the city's Moslemsector.   Several rounds exploded far below the high-flying jets, leavingwhite puffs of smoke beneath the planes' long contrails.   The Bekaa raid was Israel's 15th against targets in Lebanon thisyear. By police count, 17 people were killed and 103 wounded in theearlier attacks.   The last was carried out Nov.7 by helicopter gunships againstIranian-backed guerrillas of the fundamentalist Shiite MoslemHezbollah, or Party of God, in south Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
