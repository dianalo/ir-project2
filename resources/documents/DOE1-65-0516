Advantages include enhanced resolution,speed of analysis and lowered limits of detection. These advantages arerealized because of its efficient discrimination of capacitance currentfrom the signal of interest. One disadvantage is that the sensitivityis dependent upon the reversibility of the charge transfer reaction.This finding suggests that SWV may be useful for identifying the electrodemechanism at analyte concentrations well below those necessary for conventionalmechanistic analysis (i.e. by cyclic voltammetry). They have begun asystematic investigation of the SWV response as a function of electrodemechanism. This presentation will describe and evaluate its use for theidentification of EC mechanisms.</TEXT></DOC>
