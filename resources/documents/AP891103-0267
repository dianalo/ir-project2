The surge in production came as key players staked outbargaining positions in advance of a crucial meeting later thismonth, analysts said.   The International Energy Agency said in its Monthly Oil MarketReport that the cartel's output soared last month to 22.9 millionbarrels a day, about 500,000 barrels more than in the previousmonth.   But some analysts put the figure even higher. OPEC's dailytarget is 20.5 million barrels a day for the last quarter of 1989.   ``The main OPEC production increase was registered in SaudiArabia where crude oil production rose to 5.3 million barrels a dayin October,'' said the report. Saudi Arabia's quota is about 5million barrels a day.   ``They've got the pedal to the metal,'' said Peter Gignoux,international energy director at Shearson Lehman Hutton in London,who believes the Saudis produced 5.6 million barrels a day or more.   The Saudis, he said, are ``setting another bargaining chip onthe table for this month's meeting.''   Petrostrategies, a Paris-based oil newsletter, also puts Saudiproduction at 5.6 million barrels a day and total OPEC output at23.2 million barrels in the first half of October.   ``There is now a real risk that the current strength of oilprices could give way to a gradual slide over coming weeks,'' itsaid. ``Although oil demand remains firm, it is insufficient toabsorb the high supply.''   Oil prices have been fairly steady, although they remain underthe cartel's target of $18 a barrel. A basket of seven crudesmonitored by OPEC averaged $17.43 a barrel in late October.   Prices for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,have remained in the $19 to $20-a-barrel range in the last twomonths. WTI normally is priced about $2 higher than the OPEC basket.   Soaring demand by developing countries has helped soak up OPEC'sexcess, but many analysts agree that prices could suffer ifproduction is not reined in soon.   Demand for OPEC's oil in the first half of 1990 was estimated bythe energy agency at just under 21 million barrels a day.Consumption by the United States, still the world's largestconsumer of oil, and other industrial nations is expected to shrinkin coming months due partly to seasonal factors.   OPEC's oil ministers are scheduled to meet on Nov. 25 in Vienna,Austria, to map strategy for the coming year. An eight-membermonitoring panel is due to gather a few days earlier.   At the top of their agenda will be new production caps for thefirst half of 1990.   The ministers will have to weigh demand and prices beforedeciding an overall supply target and then divvying up the sumamong the 13 nations.   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been cheating on theirquotas in recent months to press their demands for a larger shareof the output total.   At a September meeting in Geneva, the ministers agreed to lifttheir production ceiling from 19.5 million barrels a day to 20.5million barrels in the October-December period.   They also discussed _ and will do so again at the upcomingmeeting _ an Iranian plan for passing out new production shares.   The proposal called for raising the overall output cap to 21.5million barrels a day to meet the demands primarily of Kuwait andthe United Arab Emirates. Gabon and Ecuador also would get more.   The shares of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Libya would stay the same.Iran and Iraq would lose a little, and Algeria, Nigeria, Indonesiaand Venezuela would lose more.   The agency is an arm of the 24-nation Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development.  </TEXT></DOC>
