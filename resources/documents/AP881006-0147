State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said extension of``consular privileges'' to about 50 of the 250 employees in theprocurement mission and a trade office would probably not beretroactive.   U.S. officials said last month that Israel had been seeking inmonths of talks the privileges for 47 staff members of its militaryprocurement office. They said the office has been investigated forinvolvement in two cases of illegal export of American militarytechnology.   Mrs. Oakley said she was unsure of the differences betweenconsular privileges and full diplomatic immunity but that``diplomatic immunity is more extensive than the consular status.''   Other officials said the status provides protection only foractivities directly connected to a person's official functions, notfor all crimes.   ``The Israeli defense procurement mission and the trade missionin New York will be considered as annexes to the Israeli consulatein New York,'' she said. ``We estimate that approximately 50Israeli officials will require consular privileges.''   ``Most other countries that conduct defense procurementactivities from offices in the United States do so from withintheir embassies in Washington and are therefore covered bydiplomatic immunities and privileges,'' the spokeswoman said.   Members of an Egyptian military procurement office in Washingtonhave been given diplomatic immunity, officials said.   An Egyptian military officer who worked at the office wasarrested by U.S. authorities earlier this year in an alleged plotto smuggle missile components to Egypt, but he was freed afterclaiming diplomatic immunity. He has returned to Egypt.   The Justice Department in July 1986 reportedly sought toinvestigate eight Israelis in New York suspected of the illegalexport of machinery needed to manufacture cluster bombs. SpokesmanJohn Russell said last May that the department decided against anycriminal prosecution.   Another case last November involved a Connecticut company thatpaid fines of $750,000 for violating U.S. export laws by smugglingequipment and technology to Israel for the manufacture ofchrome-plated cannon barrels.</TEXT></DOC>
