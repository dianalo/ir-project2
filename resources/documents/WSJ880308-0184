Nearly 70% of workers participating in a strike ballot voted to accept an offer from the big U.S. auto maker, union leaders said yesterday. Leaders had urged union members to reject the contract, which involves accepting Japanese-style work practices aimed at boosting productivity.    Ford's white-collar unions representing 12,500 salaried workers threatened a walkout when contract talks broke down late last month. The breakdown followed a two-week strike by Ford's U.K. manual workers over similar work-practice issues. The blue-collar workers' strike halted production at Ford's 22 U.K. plants and its factory in Genk, Belgium.    The white-collar contract promises clerical workers and foremen the same pay increase accepted by manual workers: 7% in the first year and a second-year boost of 7% or 2.5 percentage points above inflation, whichever is higher. </TEXT></DOC>
