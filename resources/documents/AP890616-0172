No pickup</HEAD><BYLINE>By MARCOS ALEMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The centrist Democratic Christian Partydenounced as repressive and unconstitutional on Friday a proposedlaw by the new rightist administration to crack down on those whodisagree with it.   The governing Republican Nationalist Alliance, known as Arena,has called the legislation a ``law in defense of the democraticprocess.'' It proposes fines and prison sentences for those whooppose the government or its policies, including journalists andthose who take part in protest marches.   Christian Democratic leaders gave reporters a copy of theproposed law, which executive committee member Ricardo Perdomocalled ``the preamble to total repression in El Salvador.''   Fidel Chavez Mena, party secretary-general and one-timepresidential nominee, told a news conference the measure wasunconstitutional and would ``violate the most elemental guaranteesand individual rights.''   Arena was scheduled to submit the bill for congressional approvalon Thursday but did not. Arena members did not explain at that timewhy the legislation was not submitted and refused to discuss detailswith reporters.   El Salvador's new president is Arena member Alfredo Cristiani,who assumed power June 1 from Christian Democrat Jose NapoleonDuarte after winning big in March elections.   Gloria Salguero Gross, a high-ranking Arena member and assemblydeputy, told reporters Thursday the assassination of Cabinet memberJose Antonio Rodriguez Porth on June 9 ``is a call to reflect and wemust give an answer within the constitution, within the arms ofdemocracy.''   Arena holds a congressional majority.   Arena officials and the military blamed the killing on theFarabundo Marti Liberation Front guerrilla group, or FMLN. TheMarxist-led FMLN on Thursday issued a communique denyingresponsibility. The guerrillas said the 73-year-old minister of thepresidency probably was shot on June 9 as a result of factionalfighting within the government.   The FMLN has fought the U.S.-backed government for nine years.   Perdomo said Friday, ``We are worried that a repressive law suchas this could in one given moment bite down on the social andpolitical forces of this country, taking away the space we have tooppose and fight for the interests of the great majority.''   The bill would establish fines for the FMLN and what thegovernment considers to be rebel-related groups that engage in armedactions, sabotage, strikes or public demonstrations that ``clogtraffic on principal roadways, avenues or streets of the a city,impeding the passage of people or vehicles.''   The Christian Democrats pointed to one article they said deniesfreedom of the press.   It would makes it illegal for reporters to send outside thecountry news or information ``destined to upset the constitutionalor legal order, the tranquility or security of the country, theeconomic or monetary regimen.''   The government will move against publishers and broadcasters``who use in their journalistic pages or on radio and televisiontransmissions such news or information,'' the legislation says.   The document says the legislation would augment a law already onthe books banning ``the existence of armed groups of a political,labor union or religious character.''</TEXT></DOC>
