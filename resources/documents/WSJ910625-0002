The pocket phones are similar to cellular phones, butoperate on different radio frequencies, use less power, andare smaller. ATandamp;T wants to conduct a three-phase test of thenew service on its network of microwave towers, beginninglate this year and running through 1993.</LP><TEXT>   The first phase of the test would determine whether thefrequencies would disrupt existing equipment, the secondwould test the radiophones themselves, and the third wouldinvolve tests with large groups in Atlanta, Los Angeles andBoston.   A growing number of companies, including the Baby Bells,plan to erect networks to provide similar service tocustomers using tiny pocket phones. The FCC has awarded about40 licenses in the U.S. to test &quot;personal communicationsservices.&quot; Such firms as American Personal CommunicationsInc. and Millicom Inc. have received FCC permission to testtheir systems at various frequencies.   ATT's move is an outgrowth of an internal debate over howto gain entrance to the booming market for mobilecommunications. Any decision to go ahead would put it incompetition for local phone services, something it hasn'tdone since its breakup in 1984.   However, a spokesman for ATandamp;T cautioned, &quot;there are stilla lot of bridges to cross&quot; before the company can certifythat a new service using its network is possible. ATandamp;T needsFCC approval to conduct the tests because the agencyallocates the spectrum for communications services.   ATandamp;T, one of the world's largest suppliers of cellularnetwork equipment, has been looking for ways to expand itsinfluence over equipment that will be installed in futurenetworks providing pocket-phone services. Since August, thecompany has been working with Qualcomm Inc., a San Diegocompany that pioneered Code Division Multiple Access, orCDMA, technology.   CDMA systems are said to offer up to 20 times morecall-handling capacity than the conventional cellular systemsby assigning a special electronic code to each call signal,allowing more calls to occupy the same space and be spreadover an entire frequency band.   Under its plan, ATandamp;T would conduct its tests in thefrequency range of 5.9 gigahertz to 6.4 gigahertz, ultimatelygiving prototypes of the pocket-sized phone to a total of3,000 people in Atlanta, Los Angeles and Boston.   &quot;We have 3,000 microwave towers across the U.S.,&quot; the ATandamp;Tspokesman said. &quot;It's a big asset, it's nationwide.&quot;   Successful tests would give ATandamp;T a new use for itsmicrowave network, which it has been gradually taking out ofservice since late 1988 when it took a $6.2 billionwrite-down and switched its traffic to a new network offiber-optic transmission lines and digital switches. Lessthan 10% of ATandamp;T's transmissions currently travel overmicrowave radio and coaxial cable lines, the spokesman said.   If approved, the first phase of ATandamp;T's test would last 10months. And if the test is successful, the company willdistribute laboratory models of the new phone to &quot;a limitednumber&quot; of users, possibly employees, who would use them forabout 14 months beginning in the second half of 1992. In thethird phase of the test, ATandamp;T would distribute prototypes ofthe new phones to users in Atlanta, Los Angeles and Boston.   &quot;We're interested in personal communications, but we'regoing to do it right,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;That meansgetting through this experiment&quot; before making a long-termcommitment to the business.</TEXT></DOC>
