The governing council for the environmentalist party had beendominated by a radical faction that sees little worth in trying toinfluence government actions by working within the West Germanparliament.   Only 44 of the 519 Bundestag seats are held by members of theGreens Party.   About 400 Greens delegates gathered during the weekend inKarlsruhe for a special party conference, during which ano-confidence vote was proposed. The council and their supportershad been blamed by other factions within the party for``irregularities'' in the financing of a new party building in Bonn.   The no-confidence declaration was approved by a 214 to 186 vote,after which the council resigned.   Ousted council member Christian Schmidt said the shakeup maycause the more radical faction to form their own political party.   Parliament member and Greens moderate Otto Schily said he viewedthe departure of the far-left leadership as a chance for themoderates to bring the party closer to the political center.   The 39,000-member party had been moving farther left during thepast year, a trend that moderates feared could alienate more votersand jeopardize the Greens' continued participation in the Bundestag.Only political parties garnering at least 5 percent of the vote innational elections are allowed to send representatives to theparliament.   Greens candidates got 8.3 percent of the vote during the lastfederal elections in 1987.   The party that developed from a radical environmentalist movementin the 1970s formed a national organization in 1979 and first wonelection to the Bundestag in 1983.</TEXT></DOC>
