Even after the sessions between President Bush and Mikhail S.Gorbachev off Malta, officials here say Japan's defense budget willcontinue the decade-long upward momentum that has made this countryone of the world's top military spenders.   ``Our own efforts for improving our self-defense are notexpected to change at the moment,'' Foreign Ministry spokesmanTaizo Watanabe said at a news conference when asked if theBush-Gorbachev meetings would affect Japan's military spending.   Seiki Nishihiro, vice minister of defense, said recent movementsin Eastern Europe and developments in U.S.-Soviet relations wouldbe considered. But he told reporters Japan must continue its policyto reach the minimum standards of military preparedness set out in1976; Japan and the Soviet Union have yet to sign a treaty toformally end World War II.   ``There may have been a change in the Soviets' mood with therecent detente, but we haven't seen any practical reduction inforce,'' said a Defense Agency official, who requested anonymity.``We can't start cutting our forces just because they say they planto cut theirs.''   Washington agrees with Japan about Soviet forces in NortheastAsia but is talking about cutting its own defense outlays. The U.S.Congress, meanwhile, is calling on Japan to spend more to help makeU.S. reductions possible.   Under heavy pressure from Capitol Hill, President Bush hassigned a defense bill that urges Japan to increase its militaryspending and requires the U.S. executive to negotiate an agreementfor Japan to completely offset the costs of maintaining the 50,000American servicemen and women stationed here.   Japan currently shoulders about $2.8 billion, or 45 percent, ofthe annual expenses for the Americans in Japan. The Japanesegovernment has refused official comment on the bill signed by Bush.   Because of sensitivities caused by Japan's defeat in World WarII, Japan generally has observed a self-imposed ceiling of 1percent of gross national product on its defense spending.   Although that mark has been surpassed slightly each year since1985, critics in the United States call the ceiling artificiallylow, and compare it to the annual U.S. defense budget of $300billion, or roughly 6 percent of GNP. Western estimates put Sovietmilitary spending at roughly 15 percent to 25 percent of GNP.   Tokyo has increased expenditures to support its 274,000 militarypersonnel by about 5 percent in real terms every year since 1980,and its current defense outlays are roughly equal to those ofBritain, West Germany or France.   Expenditures under Japan's current five-year plan will total$76.5 billion, and next year's budget is expected to top 4 trillionyen ($27.8 billion).   The increases have helped Japan create a sophisticatedanti-submarine network in straits vital to the Soviet navy in thenorthwest Pacific and build up an impressive number of advancedfighter jets, which by 1990 will reach roughly 300 _ about the samenumber deployed by the U.S. Air Force to defend the continentalUnited States.   The buildup, however, risks alienating Asian countries thatharbor bitter memories of Japanese invasions before and duringWorld War II.   At the same time, anti-military sentiment in Japan, coupled witha Constitution that bans the use of military force, has restrictedthe operations of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, making itdifficult for Japanese politicians to meet U.S. demands or theirown goals to expand the military.   Katsuyoshi Kimura, head of the opposition Democratic SocialistParty's Policy Deliberation Committee, said in an interview thatJapanese troops should be allowed to take part in United Nationscease-fire missions, emergency rescues after natural disasters andother non-lethal tasks abroad.   ``All we are suggesting is that Japan do what is common sensefor other nations,'' Kimura said. ``Some people abroad say thatJapan is willing to put out the money, but not the sweat.''   After an unprecedented victory in Diet elections last summer,the leading opposition Socialist Party called for declaring Japan anuclear-free zone and conducting strict searches to ensure U.S.Navy ships entering Japanese ports do not carry nuclear weapons.   The U.S. 7th Fleet is based in Yokosuka, just south of Tokyo,and a nuclear-free zone would challenge U.S. policy of notrevealing the location of the Navy's nuclear arms.   Like a wall between Soviet Asia and the Pacific Ocean, Japan isboth a first line of defense against the Soviet military and acrucial U.S. ally should war break out.   About 60 percent of all Soviet ground and air force divisionsand 90 percent of the bombers in the Far East are deployed nearJapan, according to ``Defense of Japan 1989,'' a Defense Agencyreport. The Soviet Pacific Fleet, the largest in the Soviet navy,has its home port in Vladivostok.   The Soviets also have about 10,000 soldiers on the southernKurils, several small islands off Hokkaido, Japan's northernmostisland, the report said.   Japan claims the islands, known as the Northern Territories,which were occupied by the Soviets after World War II, and theterritorial dispute has kept Japan and the Soviet Union fromsigning a treaty officially ending their World War II hostilities.   U.S. Ambassador Michael H. Armacost, in a recent interview, saidSoviet forces in the region ``far exceed any defensiverequirements,'' and meaningful reductions have not been made.   ``To date, the reductions they have foreshadowed do not havemuch effect on the forces that are located in the Northeast Asianregion,'' he said.   Even so, Karl Jackson, Bush's assistant National SecurityCouncil adviser, said ``no one but a fool'' would risk waging warwith the U.S.-Japan alliance in the northern Pacific.   ``If the two largest economies in the world can maintainrelative harmony, all other potential adversaries must, ofnecessity, come to our table,'' he said in a recent speech inWashington.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Dec. 10</NOTE></DOC>
