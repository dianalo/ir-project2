Substantial technical advancehave been made in the application of molten salt technology to STCR plants,but the hurdle of high first plant cost remains. In the Utility SolarCentral Receiver Study, performed by Arizona Public Service, a key issuewas evaluation of technical and economic feasibility of central receiverplant modularization. Two types of modularization were considered. Replicativemodularization consists of using multiple identical subsystems; e.g.,two heliostat fields, two receivers on two towers, combined with onethermal storage unit, one steam generator, and one electric power generatingsystem (EPGS). Incremental modularization involves a sequential buildupof subsystems; e.g., a full size receiver operating in a derated modeuntil the entire heliostat field is installed. The modular plants werecompared with a single collector/receiver plant (i.e., mode-modular 60MWe plant). The non-modular plant exhibited the lowest cost of energyand the lowest cost/value ratio. The replicative modular system describedhad a cost/value ratio 1.11 times that of the non-modular system. Modularsystems using phased construction may be attractive from a cash flowconsideration, in spite of higher cost/value ratio. The conclusion isthat a non-modular system is probably the most cost effective option.</TEXT></DOC>
