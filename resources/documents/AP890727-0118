(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two Greenpeace U.S.A. ships set sailThursday for an offshore missile test zone in an effort to halt thelaunch of a Navy Trident 2 missile from a submerged submarine.   The launching is scheduled for Friday afternoon, and theprotesters will be campaigning for ``nuclear free seas,'' saidShannon Fagan, a spokeswoman for the environmental group.   The Navy said it would not comment on Greenpeace's plans. Italso said it does not announce Trident launch schedules in advance.   It would be the second underwater test firing of the Trident 2,the Navy's newest, most powerful nuclear-armed missile. The firsttest, in March, ended in an explosion when the weapon pinwheeledout of control four seconds after it cleared the surface.   Because the launch would take place in international water morethan 30 miles off Cape Canaveral, Fagan said the Navy would havedifficulty trying to oust Greenpeace's two foreign-registered shipsfrom the missile test zone.   ``We'll be testing our right of innocent passage,'' she said.Navy ships claim right of innocent passage in entering the BlackSea or sailing in water claimed by Libya.   The two ships are the Monticivitano, a 60-foot sailing sloopunder Swedish registry, and the M.V. Greenpeace, a 190-foot vesselflying the Dutch flag.   The Monticivitano, with seven people on board, left Fort Pierce,about 70 miles south of here. The Greenpeace, with about 20 onboard, set off from Daytona Beach, 60 miles to the north.   Greenpeace member Joel Clement said the ships would not try toget close to the submarine or its support ships, but will enter azone of several square miles that is off-limits during the test.   The Navy has said it plans to have the Trident 2 operational andon sea patrol by next March. The weapon has a range of 4,600 milesand each can carry up to eight nuclear warheads.   The Navy plans to develop a 21-submarine force carrying Trident2 missiles at a cost of about $155 billion over the vessels'30-year lifetime, according to a report from the congressionalGeneral Accounting Office.   Greenpeace International, founded in 1971, began a campaign twoyears ago for elimination of naval nuclear weapons. Its ships haveattempted in the past to halt French nuclear weapons testing in thePacific.</TEXT></DOC>
