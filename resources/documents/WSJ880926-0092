Today the world celebrates his centenary, memorializing the last great poet to speak to all speakers of English as one people.    This morning in London at St. Stephen's Church, where Eliot was a zealous and regular parishioner, the event was celebrated with a performance of Mozart's Coronation Mass. The Eliot festivities included a &quot;Walk Through the Wasteland&quot; to see whether those parts of London mentioned in the poem of that name correspond to the &quot;unreal city&quot; it describes with such memorable revulsion. Yesterday there was an evening of poetry readings called &quot;How Pleasant to Meet Mr. Eliot.&quot; The title is itself a pleasant allusion to Eliot's self-mocking verse &quot;How Unpleasant to Meet Mr. Eliot!&quot;    Like him or not, anybody paying attention to the world of literature and book chat this week will be finding Eliot hard to avoid. The main concrete event is the publication of &quot;The Letters of T.S. Eliot, Volume I, 1898-1922&quot; (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 639 pages, $29.95), edited by the poet's widow, second wife and former secretary, Valerie Eliot. The collection ends with the year that Eliot published &quot;The Wasteland.&quot; That makes a nice cutoff date, but, as Mrs. Eliot is eager to tell you, she had originally hoped the book would carry forward a bit further into the '20s. But Faber andamp; Faber, the same London publisher where she and Tom (as everyone in London seems to call him now) worked side by side, didn't want a book any fatter than the one they and Harcourt in the U.S have now produced.    Mrs. Eliot was holding forth one evening last week, a cheerful and confident woman in a cheerful and confident green dress, in the board room of Lloyds Bank. Lloyds is where Eliot worked for a few years starting in 1917. The current board room is a stunning example of 1933 deco burled walnut paneling that post-dates the poet's toils in the bank's Colonial and Foreign Department. He was even then a major figure in English letters, and some of his bookish friends, including Ezra Pound, wanted to get him out of there and into literature full time. But Eliot seems to have thrived in the City. The bank took out an ad in the Times of London last week, which ran opposite excerpts from Mrs. Eliot's edition of the letters. The ad reprinted a line from a letter written in 1917: &quot;I am getting along nicely in my work at the bank and I like it.&quot; Underneath, the bank said in its own voice: &quot;We're no strangers to arts sponsorship.&quot;    This claim took on real shape in the Lloyds board room at the Eliot book party. The firm's historian had put together a small exhibition of Eliotiana, including the form the poet filled out when he came to work at the firm. That form was stamped &quot;left&quot; with the date of his departure. This pleased Sir Jeremy Morse, the chairman of Lloyds, who said he much preferred that formulation to the usual &quot;quit.&quot; Mr. Morse showed himself to be a thorough-going word man in an elegant little speech to the gathering of bankers, publishers, journalists and poets. He quoted aptly from Eliot's work, in particular from a passage that described a commuter's approach to the Lloyds offices; he presented a small anthology of poetic allusions to the word &quot;bank&quot;; and made a brief, unabashed pitch for contributions to the Eliot memorial fund at the London Library.    I say unabashed because Sir Jeremy knew well that this fund raising in Eliot's name had raised a protest, because leading figures in the London Library appeal are Jews and Eliot was on record as an anti-Semite, in his poems and in a lecture in which he said Jews were an undesirable force militating against the health of traditional literary culture.    Eliot's anti-Semitism, which was certainly a minor aspect of his writing, did fit together with similarly trivial pieces of racist and misogynist doggerel that Eliot scholarship, including Mrs. Eliot's, is bringing to general attention. Of course, everyone has always known that Eliot was a conservative with downright reactionary friends. But the newest Eliot biography -- &quot;Eliot's New Life,&quot; by the Oxford don Lyndall Gordon (Farrar, Straus andamp; Giroux, 356 pages, $19.95) -- shows the poet in much greater depth than ever before, drawing on much new material. Ms. Gordon sees Eliot as a tortured, failed saint, praying in the London subway on his way from church to his editor's desk at Faber. She also portrays Eliot as a man of many layers, who shocked and mystified two of the women who loved him for decades by dropping them summarily.    One of them, the Bostonian Emily Hale, received more than 1,000 letters from Eliot, which now are under seal at Princeton until 2020. Eliot had Hale's letters to him burned after he decided to marry his young and worshiping secretary. But now the Hale trove, which is the largest collection of Eliot letters to any single person, may be a tantalizing absence in future volumes of correspondence edited by Mrs. Eliot. The other night at Lloyds she dismissed the problem: &quot;Oh,&quot; she said, &quot;you mean Tom's letters to Emily.&quot;    Eliot himself, actually his ashes, is resting in peace in this Somerset village of stone cottages with thatched roofs 150 miles west of London. East Coker is the place from which the poet's ancestor Andrew Eliot emigrated to America in 1669. It is also the name and the setting for one of Eliot's greatest poems, the second of his &quot;Four Quartets.&quot; As Eliot wrote: &quot;In a warm haze, the sultry light is absorbed, not refracted, by grey stone. . . .&quot; and flowers do indeed &quot;sleep in empty silence.&quot; In the austere little Church of St. Michael and All Angels, in the northwest corner, is a plaque for the poet, quoting from &quot;East Coker&quot;: &quot;In my beginning is my end.&quot; There is a special leaf let reprinting the poem. Eliot's books, including the one whose poems became the lyrics for the musical &quot;Cats,&quot; are on sale, and a potter in the village, Gloria Mead, is making Eliot centennial mugs, for sale at around $4.25. Eliot's play &quot;Murder in the Cathedral&quot; was performed in the church yesterday.    But the most ardent memorializing of this returned son of the East Coker diaspora is going on in the Helyar Arms, the local pub. Its brochure states: &quot;William Dampier the explorer was born in East Coker as was T.S. Eliot, the poet who although he emigrated to America, never forgot East Coker and mentions it in his poems.&quot;    Eliot visited East Coker only once, in 1937, when he was almost 50 years old. By then he was a naturalized Briton. But now he is a real one. I raise my glass of scrumpy, the local hard cider, to that great English poet, the Missourian T. S. Eliot. In his end was his beginning. </TEXT></DOC>
