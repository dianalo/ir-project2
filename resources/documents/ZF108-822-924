McBride, financial planning specialist atNuclear Fuel Services in Erwin, Tennessee, was one of the victims of theModel 80's motherboard problems.andP;  &quot;In the first three months I had the Model80,&quot; McBride explains,&quot;I started to have problems with the hard disk and thecontroller card.andP;  Then the motherboard failed.andP;  The repairman came in,assessed the problem, and took the CPU back with him to the shop.andP;  He had toreplace the motherboard entirely.andP;  &quot; Although McBride's dealer did well byhim, turning the system around in only 24 hours, the experience has souredhim on IBM.andP;  &quot;I wouldn't buy from IBM again unless I were forced to,&quot; hesays.andM;And other survey participants told us they had to wait over a month to gettheir Model 80s fixed when the motherboard failed.andM;MODEL 55SXandM;IBM's 386SX-based PS/2 Model 55SX, introduced a year and a half ago, faredsimilarly to its 386-based siblings.andP;  At the time of the survey, it had beenon 80 respondents' desktops for an average of eight months-the same length oftime as the average 386SX.andP;  The Model 55SX had held up well, with only 21percent of the survey participants reporting a problem with it, lower thanthe 31 percent for SXs overall.andP;  Although the buy-again results were averagecompared with all PCs, they were low for 386SX-based systems: 81 percent saidthey'd buy again from IBM, compared with the 80 percent average for allsystems and the 88 percent average for all SX-based PCs.andM;Like the more-powerful PS/2s, the Model 55SX disappointed respondents on techsupport; it scored 57, lower than the average 65 for SX-based machines.andP;  Onrepair service, however, the 55SX got a score of 77, comparable with theaverage 74.andM;MODELS 30 AND 50andM;The 286-based Model 50, introduced with the other original PS/2s three yearsago, had been in use an average of just under two years-seven months lessthan the average 286 on our survey.andP;  The Model 50 elicited 388 responses.andO;Its scores were in line with the Model 55SX's, except for one improvement.andO;The percentage of participants who indicated a problem with it was evenlower-only 29 percent complained, compared with 42 percent for 286s overall.andM;The problem incidence for the 8086based Model 30 was better still, with only25 percent of the respondents reporting troubles.andP;  269 participants have beenusing the Model 30 (introduced three years ago) for an average of 19months-shorter than the more than three years of use for the average8086/8088-based PC.andM;PCS AT AND XTandM;The classic AT was rated average on all but one survey question: satisfactionwith tech support, which got a score of 60, below the average score of 66 for286s.andP;  Now five years old, the AT had been on 361 respondents' desks forthree and a half years on the average (over a year longer than the average286-based PC).andM;According to our survey, the six-year-old XT has held up remarkably well.andO;Its scores were average across the board-even though 378 respondents reportedhaving used the XT for an average of almost four years,about a yearlongerthan the average 8086/8088-based system.andM;THE ORIGINAL PCandM;IBM's original PC, introduced nine years ago, inspired comments from 378survey respondents who'd used it over five years on the average.andP;  Theseparticipants gave the PC a score of 96 for overall reliability-the highest ofany IBM machine.andP;  An average 41 percent of the respondents reported problems,to which they gave a below-average severity rating of 38.andP;  Original PCrespondents were happier with the service and support they'd received fromBig Blue than any other group of IBM customers who responded to our survey;they gave tech support a score of 68 and repair service a score of 84.andM;Survey respondent Stephen D. Hall, an attorney with Peterson, Moss, Olsen,Meacham andamp; Carr in Idaho Falls, Idaho, told us his international tale of solidservice for his PC.andP;  &quot;I bought my IBM PC with two floppy disk drives in Julyof 1984 because I knew I'd be living overseas, and I thought I'd get the bestsupport with an IBM machine.andP;  And when I was living in Puerto Rico,l did havea problem with the motherboard.andP;  Considering that I was living in PuertoRico, I got really good service; it came back within a week with a newmotherboard.&quot;andM;DEALER RELATIONSandM;Since 198 1, when it launched the original PC, IBM has sold its personalcomputers through two distribution channels: a direct sales force for largecorporate accounts, and authorized dealers for end users.andP;  Corporatecustomers get support directly from the National Service Division.andP;  End usersget support primarily from the dealer, with IBM exercising some control overthat support.andM;According to L. D. Deaton, IBM's director of marketing support at theNational Distribution Division, &quot;IBM's philosophy is that service and supportshould be available to the customer from the point of purchase.andP;  That's whyIBM requires all authorized dealers to staff at least two trained techniciansand to maintain a repair facility.andP;  We also publish a list ofrecommended-they used to be required but now they're recommended-spare partsto stock.&quot;andM;About 18 months ago, IBM launched a program it calls the Service Partnership,which was designed to create a closer relationship with dealers and toaugment dealers' service offerings where appropriate.andP;  According to IBM'sDeaton, the Service Partnership &quot;provides support where the dealer can't meetcustomer needs because of location, staffing, whatever.andP;  The dealer has achoice of letting IBM handle the maintenance agreement, in which case IBMpays the dealer a percent of the contract, or of reselling IBM's service.&quot; Awarranty upgrade-from customer carry-in to on-site service-and a maintenanceagreement to cover service needs beyond warranty are sold to dealers, who inturn sell them to the end user.andM;Bill Waas, vice president of service for ComputerLand Corp., &quot; can't speakhighly enough about the direction IBM has taken.&quot; Before the ServicePartnership program, Waas recalls, &quot;there was a good deal of contentionbetween IBM and its dealers because of channel conflict.andP;  But since then, IBMhas gone to great lengths to eliminate that conflict as much as possible, andthe situation has totally flip-flopped.andP;  &quot;andM;The primary vehicle for dealer feedback these days is IBM's Service AdvisoryCouncil, which, like Compaq's Executive Council, is made up of executivesfrom dealers across the country.andP;  According to ComputerLand's Waas, Big Blueis all ears: &quot;Now IBM listens very carefully to the needs and requirements ofthe dealer channel.andP;  It's not a one-way conversation anymore-it's a two-waydialogue.&quot; And like Compaq, IBM provides a toll-free tech-support line fordealers, which, Deaton says, was recently improved to answer urgent callslive.andM;WHAT THE USER GETSandM;What this means for the end user is that no matter who your IBM authorizeddealer is, you can get on-site service should you want it.andM;For some survey participants, that makes a big difference.andP;  Philip Paulson,LAN manager for Sycamore, Illinois-based Genoa Business Forms, says he's&quot;decided to go True Blue all the way.&quot; A Compaq Deskpro 286 owner himself, henow buys only PS/2 Model 70s for the two dozen nodes on Genoa's network.andO;&quot;Service,&quot; he says, &quot;is the reason for this decision.&quot; After years offrustrating experiences with poorly trained technicians from dealers, he'sopting for IBM's onsite warranty upgrade: &quot; I'm tired of training dealers'service people.andP;  You get a good one, and he's gone in a year or two.andP;  I justdon't want to get stuck with some computer store's flunky.andP;  IBM keeps itspeople up to date, and they've done a heck of a good job servicing mymachines for the past nine months.&quot;andM;For large accounts, IBM offers even more: its new End User Support Programprovides telephone tech support for a monthly fee, starting at $30 per systemfor 25 CPUs.andP;  &quot;The tech support personnel are trained in PCs, PS/2s, clones,and Apple systems, as well as in most software applications,&quot; says GeorgeBeada, program manager of complementary services.andP;  &quot;The End User SupportProgram provides a one-stop tech support, not just IBM-specific support.andP;  &quot;andM;With the recently announced PS/1, IBM is delving even further into end-usersupport, providing on-line services and a toll-free tech-support line to thehome audience it hopes to capture.andP;  (See &quot;IBM's PS/1 Removes the Hassles andDelivers Decent Performance for Beginners,&quot; in the August 1990 issue.) Butthere's no indication that IBM will extend this type of service to itsbusiness customers.andM;Survey participant and PS/2 Model 70 owner Charles Paul de Young sums up thefeelings expressed by many IBM customers interviewed for this story.andP;  Acomputer consultant in Rock Hill, South Carolina, de Young travels three daysa week, lugging his Model 70 (which he bought before the Model P70 386 cameout) with him.andP;  &quot;Buying an IBM is like buying a Mercedes,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;You putout a lot of money up front, but it's worth it for the lasting value andreliability you get in return.andP;  &quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
