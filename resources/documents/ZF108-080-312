 Modern software productivitytools offer some potential for improvement, but without a managementframework, they are unlikely to provide the answer.andM;Delivering systems in increments can enhance end users' perceptions of thedeveloping system and speed the delivery of systems of extraordinary quality.andO;The sense of accomplishment that derives from a series of successfuldeliveries creates a breakthrough in confidence among programmers that isrequired for sustained productivity.andM;Four key elements make up this &quot;breakthrough strategy.&quot;andP;  They are: buildingenthusiasm among the project team; delivering a visible, &quot;breakthrough&quot;component of the system early; continuing to develop the rest of the systemin increments; and using the acquired knowledge for future systemsdevelopment.andM;1.andP;  Introduce ExcitementandM;By focusing on the exciting aspects of the project, managers can build theenthusiasm of the project team.andM;Excitement occurred naturally in the information systems development projectfor the Olympic Winter Games held in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, in February1988.andP;  Those systems played a crucial role in providing immediate data tocommentators and spectators and helped the organizers manage the games.andM;Just being part of the Olympic experience energized the systems developmentteam.andP;  Still, the Olympic systems team sustained a high level of energybecause the organizing committee deliberately exploited that sense ofexcitement to achieve higher productivity.andM;Although planning was begun for the Olympic information systems early on,many of the systems users were not recruited and trained until the last fourmonths of the schedule.andP;  This created a need not only for speed but for greatflexibility in the systems, as many changes were requested at the lastminute.andP;  Systems developers were required, for example, to have the systemsin operation during Olympic qualifying trials.andP;  All of this was done whilebreaking new ground in combining real-time data collection with relationaldatabase technology to distribute information to the 43,000 Olympians,coaches and other officials.andM;Nevertheless, a small team of people built the Olympic systems in a year anda half, less than half the time generally needed to design, construct andtest systems of such complexity.andM;A number of other factors contributed to the extraordinary productivity ofthat project team.andP;  These were: a fixed deadline, clear goals, camaraderiederived from a novel project and a lack of tradition dictating work patterns.andM;Stamford, Conn.-based management consultant Robert Schaffer has studied suchfactors in projects outside systems management where unusual productivity hasoccurred.andP;  He calls these the &quot;zest factors,&quot; which release the hiddenreserve of human potential.andM;In many routine systems projects where the zest seems to be lacking, managersaccept substandard performance as normal.andP;  But every systems project has somenovelty or potential zest factor, whether it be a new technology or a newapplication area.andP;  The challenge for project managers is to create enthusiasmamong workers by exploiting that novelty.andM;2.andP;  Focus on Early ResultsandM;While the overall system plans and architectures are being prepared, somestaff members should begin working on a visible piece of the system that canbe released quickly.andP;  This is called the &quot;breakthrough project&quot; and isdefined by one or more of the following characteristics:andM;* It can be completed in weeks instead of months.andM;* It has a disciplined work plan containing activities with measurableoutcomes.andM;* It should require a change in existing work habits and experimentation withnew methods.andM;* It should have built-in incentives to reward successful teamwork.andM;Traditionally, systems are developed sequentially, beginning with arequirements definition, then a systems specification, a programmingspecification, construction and, finally, testing and implementation.andP;  Thisprocess typically takes months, if not years, leaving users to wait foranticipated results.andP;  Often, however, this conventional approach obscuresopportunities to obtain early and intermediate results from new informationsystems.andM;Systems projects usually can be designed to deliver early functionality tousers, something that can be critical to establishing an effective workingrelationship with them.andP;  A prime example of the value of near-term goalsoccurred at a pipeline company that was constructing a new system tocalculate its shipping tolls.andP;  The system was constructed with asophisticated decision support tool and relational database and wasimplemented by refocusing the development methodology to obtain earlyresults.andP;  The company made the first goal the replacement of a cumbersomeBASIC program that was poorly understood by the end users.andP;  Having a systemthey could use comfortably increased the users' enthusiasm for the entireproject, which took only three months instead of the normal nine months.andM;Successfully meeting an early first goal sets the stage for achieving moreresults faster by setting the stage for better cooperation among all parties.andO;A medium-sized energy company that was trying to select a new computer washaving trouble getting cooperation between the systems department and the endusers.andP;  The groups could not agree on the best system because of a history ofpoor working relationships.andP;  Still, the company urgently needed more computercapacity to meet the existing processing workload while the new machines werebeing evaluated.andP;  A consultant helped the two groups devise a way to relievethe capacity bottleneck with a temporary computer installation.andP;  This initialsuccess strengthened the groups' working relationship, and they quicklyagreed on the long-term hardware solution.andM;These are examples of what Tom Peters, coauthor of In Search of Excellence,has called &quot;a bias for action&quot;--the strategy of starting a project to reachan immediate goal instead of studying the costs, benefits and architecturesof a long-term solution.andP;  These studies are important, but immediate benefitscan be obtained while they are going on.andP;  Sophisticated new computerlanguages and software development aids are not effective unless managementmethods exploit their full potential.andP;  The breakthrough strategy providessuch a management tool and creates a sense of positive accomplishment.andM;3.andP;  Deliver the System IncrementallyandM;While staff members work on the breakthrough project, system designers canplan the entire system to be delivered incrementally.andP;  Adding functions ateach stage and receiving users' feedback about each enhancement will ensurethe ultimate success of the system.andM;Unfortunately, software is an abstraction and its design is often difficultto explain to an end user or manager.andP;  For this reason, it is essential toinvolve users continually in the development process.andP;  Project managers canemploy methods that allow users to see the design as it takes shape and toparticipate in the decisions required to make the systems meet the businessneed.andM;This suggests a new approach to designing systems development projects.andP;  Thedesign of the project, in contrast to the design of the system, is concernedwith the content, timing and sequence of system deliverables.andP;  Systems designis concerned with the functionality of the application and how it is tooperate with specific hardware and software.andM;Still, system project designers might take some lessons from softwarevendors, which have been designing and delivering systems in an incrementalway for years.andP;  Invariably, new software arrives in segments, with theinitial functions in a first release and more functions, and improvements,coming in later releases.andP;  This method could be a key way to improve theeffectiveness of systems projects and boost the productivity of team members.andO;It would permit a project manager to design the project so that initialimportant functions can be delivered early, within the time expectations ofusers.andP;  Then, later releases can contain additional functions.andP;  The releasescan be timed to coincide with a business cycle.andM;For example, a municipal tax authority needed a system to prepare assessmentnotices and, later in the year, to process assessments prepared by fieldinspectors.andP;  The agency designed the project to implement initially asubsystem that produced assessment notices; the assessment-processing systemfollowed six months later.andP;  Users were pleased because they obtained thefunctionality as they needed it, and the developers had the time they neededto complete the next component properly.andM;Many systems professionals will argue that large systems cannot beimplemented incrementally but must go in all at once.andP;  This is mostly truefor systems that are in the customer service loop, such as banking andairline reservations systems.andP;  But even in these cases, functionality can bedelivered incrementally.andM;Petro-Canada, a major energy company in Calgary, proved large systems can beimplemented incrementally when it developed a new materials managementsystem.andP;  The company most urgently needed to create and track purchaseorders, and because the purchasing department was centralized, it became theinitial, measurable goal.andM;To reach that goal quickly, the firm modified working procedures andmethodologies, which included using an application generator as a prototypingaid and creating user teams to work with the designers in fashioning screens,files and reports.andP;  The initial release of the purchase order system wasdelivered in six months, about half the time that was originally planned.andO;Although it was not complete, it was functional.andP;  A retrofit onto theexisting system, which the plan specified, added an additional two months.andM;The purchase order system plan was carried out independently of othersubsystems, which were added later.andP;  The subsystem for requisitions proved tobe especially difficult to produce because employees who ordered goods andservices by filling out requisition forms were decentralized.andP;  These formswere sent to the central purchasing office and were used to generate purchaseorders.andP;  Because the previous success of the purchase order system hadinstilled users' confidence, they were more willing to participate than theymight have otherwise been in the requisition subsystem's implementation.andM;Finding the proper role for users is a key element of project design.andP;  If theproject's organization is structured to include users in the planning anddesign phases, as well as the acceptance phases, the users will have astronger sense of system ownership.andP;  It is only since modern software such asscreen painters, application generators and fourth-generation languages havebeen available that meaningful user participation in design has beenpossible.andP;  Indeed, many of the productivity gains cited in this article aredue to the judicious use of these tools.andP;  However, it is not the tools bythemselves, but their management that provides the productivity.andM;Having users properly shape the systems design early in the project avoidscostly redevelopment: the end-product becomes more visible and the users canvisualize more clearly how the system should work.andM;Falconbridge Ltd., a Toronto-based diversified mining company, needed toimplement a worldwide sales and marketing system.andP;  It initially installedpersonal computers and local area networks in each country.andP;  Rather thanhaving to wait until the equipment was linked to the mainframe, end userswere shown how to use word processing, spreadsheets and electronic mail undera common menu.andP;  They were next trained in accessing outside databases andconstructing personal applications, such as sales call reporting, independentof corporate data.andM;Altogether, the project contained many such initiatives that were aimed atproviding useful results to end users.andP;  These initiatives were carried outwithin an overall goal of providing cooperative-computing services usingpersonal computers, mainframes and outside services, and were allinstrumental in achieving early results.andP;  By the time the entire network wasestablished, the users had been trained.andP;  As a result, they were using thesystem productively a year before they would have if the system had beendesigned using traditional methods.andM;4.andP;  Use Success To Build Confidence and Expand the LearningandM;Just as a successful breakthrough project paves the way for successfullycompleting the system, so can the success of an entire project be used tobuild up developers' confidence and act as a springboard for future projects.andM;E.I.andP;  Dupont de Nemours and Co. has achieved notable success with itsdevelopment of expert systems, which are run on personal computers and aredelivered incrementally.andP;  The first release of a new expert system istypically delivered within one month and consists of a few rules that allowthe user to obtain initial value from the expert system technology.andP;  Theexperience from that initial release is used to generate new rules in aseries of releases over the next few months.andP;  The success generated by earlydelivery has fostered a sense of enthusiasm in the engineers who develop thesystems and has expanded their capacity to look for more applications.andP;  In1988, the company realized over $20 million in hard benefits by itsinvestment in over 200 expert systems.andM;To further increase the contribution this strategy can make to anorganization, it is imperative for it to be applied to all projects, whichinstitutionalizes the strategy in the organization.andP;  For example,Petro-Canada continued its program of achieving breakthrough goals in allsystems development work since 1985.andM;As we have seen, the application of this strategy has generated higherproductivity and fostered committed, satisfied users in a variety ofenvironments.andP;  Systems professionals who have used it have also increasedtheir sense of accomplishment and contribution.andP;  Success in the initialproject breeds success for other projects, and users will do more when theysee systems being delivered according to their expectations.andM;All of this does not happen easily.andP;  It requires fundamental shifts inworking patterns, which are not always easy to sustain.andP;  However, we havefound that by trying it, and learning from the experience, the necessarychanges will happen.andP;  By managing the process, systems developers can makereal winners out of their organizations' systems investments.andM;W.andP;  Burry Foss is president of Gellman Hayward Inc., a management consultingfirm in Stamford, Conn.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
