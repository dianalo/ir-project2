Oakite termed the offer &quot;highly conditional&quot; and &quot;not in the best interest of its shareholders.&quot;    Oakite, a maker of specialty chemical products, said it rejected the offer on the advice of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., its investment banker. A spokesman said the offer was accompanied by numerous conditions and was &quot;inadequate from a financial point of view.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Oakite shares closed at $41.50, up 25 cents.    Carlyle, a Washington-based merchant banking and investment firm, said it owns just under 10% of Oakite's 1.65 million shares.    William Conway, managing director of Carlyle, said the offer is fair and disputed that it was highly conditional. He said, &quot;We're reviewing our options&quot; and &quot;aren't interested in doing a hostile offer.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
