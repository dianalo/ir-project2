Senior officials at the FCC and the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration said that such an order would provide a vehicle to challenge federal Judge Harold Greene's jurisdiction over the telecommunications industry. Judge Greene oversees compliance with the consent decree that broke up American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. in 1984. That decree prohibits the regional companies from selling such information services as videotex and electronic publishing.    Consumer groups and competitors of the Bell companies praise Judge Greene, saying he has prevented the regional companies from abusing their monopoly over local phone service. But the Reagan administration and the regional companies say the judge has unfairly hindered technological innovation in this country.    &quot;If you live in France (or) West Germany, you get all these new information services, but if you live in Washington, D.C., you don't get them,&quot; said a department official. &quot;The reason you don't get them is that one of 525 federal judges says you can't have them.&quot;    Senior officials of the Commerce Department agency said that if the FCC adopts the proposal, which the agency plans to seek today, the regional telephone companies would face contradictory orders from the FCC and Judge Greene. The appeals court here then would have to resolve whether the district court or the commission has authority over the regional companies. FCC officials declined comment on the plan.    Albert Halprin, a former chief of the FCC's common carrier bureau, said the Communications Act gives the commission authority over information services, despite the 1984 antitrust decree. &quot;The court can't take away powers from the FCC that are granted by Congress,&quot; he said.    But Philip Verveer, who also served as chief of the common carrier bureau, said the agency's power is more circumscribed. He said the FCC may be able to force the regional companies to offer limited services, such as tracing a caller's phone number. But he doubted whether the appeals court would sustain a broad FCC order requiring the regional companies to store and retrieve voice messages or provide electronic publishing.    The proposal of the Commerce Department agency reflects the growing frustration of federal telecommunications-policy makers with Judge Greene. Earlier this year, Judge Greene re-examined the accord overseeing the ATandamp;T breakup and continued to bar the regional companies from long-distance and manufacturing activities. He also rebuked the FCC for failing to regulate telephone companies firmly.    Judge Greene did rule that the regional companies could &quot;transport&quot; information, without fully defining that term. He is expected to spell out that concept next month. But Reagan administration officials say that this change is insufficient and criticize the judge for playing too large a role in telecommunications.    Similarly, a spokesman for one of the regional Bells, Chicago-based Ameritech, reiterated the company's previous position: &quot;The federal court isn't the proper forum for defining national telecommunications policy.&quot; Issues that have &quot;such broad social, economic and international trade implications shouldn't be determined by a single unelected individual,&quot; he added. Other regional Bells couldn't be reached for comment.    The FCC has tried to avoid public confrontations with Judge Greene, so adopting the proposal would be an about-face for the agency. It would also be a departure for the FCC's new chairman, Dennis Patrick, a cautious man not given to the bold strokes of his predecessor, Mark Fowler.    Mr. Halprin, who served under Mr. Fowler, said he believes Mr. Patrick would limit an order regarding the Bell companies to a narrow range of services in order to increase the chances of winning on appeal. &quot;If Mark believed in something, he'd do it whether he'd win or lose,&quot; said Mr. Halprin. &quot;For Dennis to act, the precondition is that he believes he would win.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
