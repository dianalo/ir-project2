(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>SPEED HAS LONG been considered the main shortcoming of PostScriptimagesetters, especially at higher resolutions.andP;  There's no free lunch, andPostScrit's advantages of machine independence, graphics functionality andimage generality came at the expense of much lower speeds than users hadgrown accustomed to from their CRT typesetters.andP;  Worse yet, in PostScript'searly days, users found it difficult to predict how long a job should take.andO;Not so long ago, it was commonplace to hear tales of pages that took hoursand hours to render, of service bureaus losing their shirts because ofmis-estimated jobs and unbillable time overruns, and similar horrors.andP;  ThePostScript language took a bad rap; the problem was as much due toinefficient application software as to slow typesetting.andP;  But the simple factremained that PostScript imaging needs much more computing power than thetext-only typesetting languages of yore.andM;With that backdrop, we set out to provide a useful means of testing how fastPostScript-language imagesetters really are in production situations.andP;  Wepublished the first results of our effort last September .andP;  At that time, wesaid we later would provide an update that would include additional companiesand machines.andP;  This issue contains the promised update.andM;Processor advancements.andP;  PostScript was loosed on the world at a time whenthe 68000 cpu was the best chip that Silicon Valley could deliver.andP;  It wassufficient (barely) for 300-dpi laser printers, but woefully underpowered forhigher resolutions.andP;  Over the last two years, 68020-powered RlPs have almostcompletely supplanted 68000-based Pips in high-resolution imagesetters.andP;  Thishas resulted in much-improved rasterizing speeds.andP;  At the same time,incremental improvements in rasterizing algorithms have yielded additionalspeed increases.andP;  Still, in most cases the speed of the RD is very much abottleneck, and a faster RIP is greatly to be desired.andM;Prospects.andP;  Obviously, the 68020 is far from the ultimate in chip technology.andO;Agfa has already moved to the 68030 and a higher clock rate.andP;  Hyphen hasbegun beta testing of its Sparc-based software, while Raster Image ProcessingSystems is racing to finish its i960 board.andP;  A few daring entrepreneurs likeHarlequin already are working on parallel processor designs.andP;  Nearly a yearago, Adobe Systems announced that it had ported its PostScript interpreter tounnamed RISC processors.andP;  As we go to press, no vendor has announced aproduct using an Adobe RISC-based interpreter, but we expect there will beseveral announcements during the spring show season.andM;Over the coming months, we expect to sec major advances in rasterizing speed.andO;For monochrome text and line art, we think that RIPs will stop being abottleneck; the limitations of today's recording engines will become thegating factor.andP;  Continuous-tone images and blended tints will still presentrasterizing problems, in terms of both speed and halftone quality, but theproblems will become much less severe than what we now put up with.andM;Baseline.andP;  The timing charts and graphs in this article are thus a kind ofbaseline against which to measure the advances we expect will come down thepike in the months ahead.andP;  However, not all the improvements win have to dowith speed (important as that is); we also hope to see improvements inhalftoning quality and in color recording.andM;Who's in, who's out?andM;In this second round of tests, our main goal was make more complete theresults we published in the first round by picking up some vendors andproducts we missed, plus adding some resolutions we hadn't been able to testlast fall.andP;  To this end, we visited Autologic, Berthold, Chelgraph,Compugraphic, Crosfield, Hell, Hyphen, Linotype, Scangraphic, Scitex andTriple-I.andM;In Chelgraph's case, we were able to test only the 600-dpi Copal plain-paperprinter because the high-resolution machines weren't ready, although we hopethey will be ready in a few more weeks.andP;  We also had hoped to test theAlphatype machines that were unveiled at Graph Expo last fall, and to thatend we showed up in Arlington Heights, armed with our Mac SE and stopwatch,only to be told that the machines aren't ready.andM;Our secondary goal was to report advances in the state of the art, even forvendors we had earlier covered.andP;  We did not try to visit every vendor fromround I again, though several of them have told us that the current producthas been improved since our last visit.andP;  A number of vendors told us thatthey had made incremental improvements in speed, but did not think thedifference was big enough to warrant retesting.andP;  But Compugraphic, Hyphen andLinotype were keen to let the world know of their developments.andM;We had hoped to measure the new i960-based Birmy-Setter, which uses a RIPSinterpreter running on a RISC computer.andP;  Alas, it is not quite ready, thoughwe believe that it is only a matter of weeks dU it win be.andM;Three groups.andP;  We divided our coverage into three groups: low-resolutionplain-paper printers, high-resolution PostScript imagesetters and PostScriptsystem &quot;gateways.&quot; The reason for this division is that, although all threekinds of system use a PostScript RIP, they serve quite different purposes.andO;Not only are there considerations relating to resolution and quality, butalso some of these machine use the RIP in different ways.andP;  As a result, theycannot be timed in the same way.andM;Plain paper.andP;  We have included four 600-dpi plain-paper machines: those fromAutologic, Chelgraph, Printware and Varityper.andP;  These don't meet ourcriterion for 1000-dpi resolution, but they are interesting for two reasons.andO;First, in some applications these machines could be used for final output,and thus are a real alternative to higher-resolution film recorders.andP;  Second,in the case of Chelgraph, we are quite eager to evaluate the speed of itshigh-resolution machines based on the same controller technology, so we feltthat the 600-dpi performance gives a clue to how the high-end devices willfare.andM;In the case of Varityper, there are now two plain-paper options, as weindicate in our discussion of architecture below.andP;  The VT600 can be purchasedas a standalone printer, as before, in which case the original Adobe RIP isused.andP;  It also can be bought as two separate pieces-the Series 4000 RIP andthe 5060 recorder-in which case a faster RIP is available.andP;  We report boththe VT600 and the 5060 on the chart.andM;The subject of medium-resolution plain-paper output is interesting in its ownright, however, and we plan to return to it in a future article that includesmore than just these four vendors.andP;  But our real focus in this article ishigh resolution; we will give these four 600-dpi machines short shrift.andM;Imagesetters.andP;  The imagesetters are standalone printers, similar in concept(at the risk of stretching our point and incurring the wrath of severalvendors) to high-resolution Laser-Writers.andP;  The time to print a job is easilymeasured, since each page is printed as soon as it is received, and while apage is being printed the RIP cannot be doing anything else.andP;  True, someimagesetters can overlap communication and rasterizing, or can handlerasterizing and imaging simultaneously.andP;  But the key fact is that each pagemust be printed in the order it is received, and the process is entirelylinear: front end to RIP to marking engine, perhaps with buffering along theway.andM;This class includes:andM;* Agfa Compugraphics PS Max Plus RIP driving its newandM;9800 recorder  and the popular 9400 recorder.andM;* Autologic's Adobe RIP driving several ECRM imagers: theandM;PelBox 108 (a 108-pica marking engine) and 108S (theandM;high-speed version of the 108) at 1016 dpi, and the 3000 atandM;1016, 1446 and 2032 dpi.andP;  We did not test Autologic drivingandM;the Bidco recorders.andM;* Berthold's Sofha RIP driving the PelBox 2000 at 1016 dpi.andM;It is also capable of running at 2032 dpi, but we did not testandM;this resolution.andM;* Birmy Graphics BirmySetters, using RIPs from RIPS drivingandM;Ultre recorders.andP;  We didn't rerun the Birmy tests, but willandM;report new speeds when the new RT is ready.andM;* Hyphen's RIPs running on Macintosh, 1386 PC, SparcStation,andM;DECstation, and on Hyphen's own proprietary hardware.andM;Hyphen drives ECRM and Ultre recorders, giving theandM;customer a straightforward tradeoff of price for speed.andM;* Itek Graphix's 7000 PS, using a RIPS controller and anandM;LED recorder.andP;  There are no changes to our data here.andM;* Linotype's RIP 4 (Adobe interpreter) driving the L300 andandM;L500 marking engines at 1270, 1693 and 2540 dpi.andM;* Monotype's Prism, Express and Pioneer recorders driven byandM;Adobe Pips.andP;  When we tested these machines last fall, the RIPandM;was brand new.andP;  There have been no significant changesandM;since then, so our results remain as last published.andM;* Optronics, which has developed a 2,000-dpi drum-basedandM;recorder aimed at the quality color market.andP;  There has beenandM;no change in the ColorSetter timings since our last report.andM;* Scangraphic's Scantext 2051 and 2030 laser drum recordersandM;using an Adobe RT.andM;* Varityper's two PostScript product lines-one using anandM;Adobe RIP and the other using one from Custom Applications,andM;Inc. (CAI).andP;  Since our last report, Varityper hasandM;changed the architecture of its Adobe-based line and increasedandM;the speed of its RIP, as we discuss below.andM;Gateways.andP;  The system gateways do not act as printers, but rather asscanners.andP;  That is, the PostScript RIP does not control a laser beamdirectly, but produces a line-work file that is passed to some other systemfor additional processing.andP;  The line-work file is presented to the system inexactly the same format as though the data were coming from a high-resolutionscanner: a run-length coded bitmap.andP;  The system can then crop, scale,colorized, rotate and pixel-edit the data, or perform any other operationthat one might apply to a scanned image: merge it with other data, save itoffline for later use, etc.andM;Our earlier tests included machines-by Autologic and Monotype-that have sucha capability.andP;  But since they can be used as straight imagesetters, that ishow we tested them.andP;  In contrast, the members of this group cannot be treatedas imagesetters- they can only be components of a larger system.andM;* Crosfield's Scripter/PS, which uses a Hyphen RIP runningandM;in a Sun 386i.andM;* Hell's ScriptMaster, which uses a Hyphen RIP running in aandM;Siemens (that is, an Apollo 3500) workstation.andM;* Scitex's VIP (Visionary Interpreter for PostScript), anandM;Adobe 68020-based RD.andM;* Information international, which uses a CAI interpreterandM;running in a Sun-3 workstation.andM;These machines can't be timed in the same way as the imagesetters; so muchdepends on the rest of the system.andP;  Most of the processing is done as abackground task; in a production environment, speed depends on the overallsystem load.andM;It is interesting to find Triple-I, a traditional vendor of monochromeeditorial pagination and display ad systems for newspapers (albeit with colorfunctionality), in this group with the three major color vendors.andP;  However,all four vendors have a similar system design philosophy.andP;  Their main productis a production-oriented system focused on a specialized task, in whichbackground processing, file management, job tracking and merging data frommultiple sources are vital aspects of the overall solution.andP;  In this context,PostScript is one more input source, a useful bridge between the productionworld and the desktop publishing or design world.andM;About the testsandM;We described our test files and the test procedures in detail last Septemberand will not repeat the whole spiel here.andP;  (A limited number of back issuesare available through our circulation department.) To summarize briefly:andM;*No killer pages.andP;  The test files ranged in difficulty fromandM;trivial to hard, but were designed to resemble jobs thatandM;imagesetter owners might encounter on a daily basis.andM;*System throughput.andP;  We measured the entire imagesettingandM;system, including front-end composition time and theandM;communication link rather than pure RIP speed.andP;  Each test beganandM;when we hit the OK button to initiate printing and endedandM;when the final page had been completely imaged.andP;  We didandM;not count the time to develop the resulting film.andM;*Standard conditions.andP;  Each system was tested under conditionsandM;as nearly identical as we could make them.andP;  WhereandM;possible, we took our own Macintosh SE/30 to the test site;andM;it played the role of front-end system.andP;  (Our experience hasandM;been that any 68020- or 68030-powered Mac would giveandM;nearly identical results, but a 68000-powered machineandM;would be noticeably slower.) We tried to eliminate extraneousandM;network traffic.andP;  To control the process of downloadingandM;header files and building font caches, we ran the PageMakerandM;jobs in the same order at every site.andM;Where a vendor supplied configuration utilities and printer-descriptionfiles, we used them.andP;  Where there was known to be some advantage in rotatingthe job 90 [degrees] to make better use of the film width, we did so.andP;  Ourtheory was that most users would quickly learn how to get the best use out oftheir equipment, so this kind of optimization represented normal fieldconditions.andM;Level playing field? Despite our intentions to administer a fair test,several vendors and even a few users raised some issues that our tests simplydid not address.andM;* Quality.andP;  We didn't ignore all quality issues, just most of them.andP;  We onlyrequired the imagesetter to be capable of 1000-dpi resolution or better, andthat the RIP implement the complete PostScript language.andP;  We didn't try todetermine which machines are capable of rendering good color separations andwhich ones should only be used for text.andM;Many vendors have announced that they are serving the  good-enough color&quot;market, whatever that means.andP;  Other vendors denounce the very concept of&quot;good enough.&quot; It is clear that this is an area that is undergoing rapidchange.andP;  There are objective and absolute measures of quality: number of grayshades the RIP can deliver, mechanical precision of the film recorder, dotaddressability and spot size and so forth.andP;  But the definition of what isgood enough is obviously relative to the imaging applications.andM;Quality distinctions are very important-perhaps even primary.andP;  If the resultis a rejected job, who cares how fast it ran? However, we elected toconcentrate on the speed factor alone.andP;  This kept the testing to a manageablelevel and permitted a more straightforward presentation of the results.andM;* Format.andP;  Our test files were all 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; pages.andP;  A number of vendors,however, have specialized in large-format imagesetters for broadsheetnewspaper pages or for color separations.andP;  These machines seem to be at adisadvantage because they must expose the full film width, even if our testleaves most of the film unused.andM;It is quite true that other things being equal, a 70-pica machine will runfaster than a 100-pica machine.andP;  However, a prospective purchaser willprobably compare only those machines that meet his size requirements.andP;  Webelieve that our tests can predict how large-format imagesetters will comparewith each other.andM;Starting point.andP;  While we think the results presented here are valuable asindicators of machine performance, we certainly don't think they are idealfor every purpose.andP;  As noted above, they ignore all but one dimension of arational buying decision.andP;  Speed is important, but it is not the only factoror even the most important factor.andP;  In addition, the tests we picked might beunrepresentative of your expected job mix.andP;  Hence, we are not issuing abox-score ranking of the machines we tested.andM;Clearly, anyone contemplating a choice among the machines in this test serieswould be well advised to compose his own suite of jobs and run them.andP;  Ourtests were designed to cover a range of complexity, but there are many otherfactors that might be important in specific situations.andP;  For example: howeasy is it to download fonts on a permanent or temporary basis? does theimagesetter handle output from other application programs correctly? whatabout job queueing and spooling? By examining the resulting output, one canjudge whether quality is acceptable or not.andP;  And of course, each user mustbalance speed and quality against the price tag.andM;A customer should also take into account his knowledge of the vendor:financial stability, warranty and service policies, the machine's reputationfor reliability, the likely duration of downtime should something fail, andso on.andP;  Other things to consider (intangible though they be) are the vendor'sstated strategic direction, its investment in Randamp;D for new technology, itsresponsiveness to customer requests and ability to react to changes in themarketplace.andM;Where do we go from here?andM;Many of the vendors we surveyed for this article have made noticeableimprovements in the speed of their imagesetters since our earlier review.andP;  Weexpect that there will be quite a few more announcements over the next fewmonths, particularly at the upcoming &quot;olympics of the graphic arts,&quot; Drupa.andO;We think that in addition to speed, most of the monochrome imagesettervendors will be talking about quality, with dot generation and colorregistration being the leading issues.andM;That means that our benchmark suite will have to evolve, as well.andP;  Ourpresent files, although they cover a range of difficulty, are heavy on textand computer-generated graphics, and only check specific performance of twomainstream application programs.andP;  We will probably drop the 'school figures,'short files which are not very representative of any real-world jobs.andP;  Wewill also add some tests of color imaging capability, including full-pagehalftones, moire and registration checks, etc.andM;As always, we urge prospective buyers to develop their own benchmarks, basedon the sort of jobs they expect to encounter in their own operations and onthe coronary factors of quality, service, price and so forth.andP;  In the finalanalysis, what counts is the productivity and profitability that users canachieve, rather than numbers on a chart.andP;  We hope our numbers are useful, butwe know that this is only the start of the process.andM;ImagesettersandM;Agfa CompugraphicandM;As our story on page 37 of this issue details, Agfa Compugraphic has justannounced a new imagesetter and a new RIP.andP;  We were privileged to visit theAgfa Compugraphic facility in Wilmington, MA, the week before this issue wentto press, and were able to clock the new equipment in the laboratory theandM;Mix'n match.andP;  Agfa is recommending that the 9800 imager be driven by the MaxPlus RD, and that the 9400 imager be driven by the Max Rm.andP;  We measured the9400/Max combination last fall and have kept those numbers in the chart.andP;  Butwe suspect that some users may want to run their 9400s with the faster MaxPlus Rip, so we have shown timings for that configuration as well.andP;  How manybuyers elect to go this route will surely depend on the price differential,which won't be disclosed for a couple of weeks yet.andM;AutologicandM;We tested Autologic in the first round, but unfortunately the machine we ranthe tests on last summer had been equipped with only 4 MB of working memory.andO;This turned out to be less than optimal; the TROUT file, in particular, ranquite, slowly.andP;  Autologic says that 8 MB is now recommended as the standardconfiguration.andM;With that in mind, we returned to the Autologic demonstration room thiswinter.andP;  In addition to confirming that the larger memory makes a significantdifference, we were able to test a larger range of resolutions and recordingengines with the RIP.andM;To point up the difference between a 4-MB RIP and an 8-MB RIP, here are the&quot;before&quot; and  &quot;after&quot; results.andM;APS6/1085@1016 dpi   MONO1   NO POX  WITH PIX   TROUTandM;4MB              4:51    3:02    10:55     41:13andM;8MB              3:29    2:27    10:22     13:18andM;It is clear that even simple jobs like MONO1 and NO PIX benefit from theadditional working memory, while a complex job like TROUT really requires it.andM;If 8 MB is good, would more be better) There are sockets on Autologic's RDboard for up to 16 MB, so you could have it if you wanted it.andP;  Autologic saysthat so far, there is not much evidence that the routine jobs its customershave encountered would benefit much from the extra memory.andP;  On the otherhand, complex jobs (lots of font changes, vignettes, image rotations and soon), although they might only come up occasionally, would probably run fasterif more working memory were available.andM;RAM disk.andP;  Autologic has adopted an interesting approach to squeezing morespeed out of the current RIP technology.andP;  Like most other Adobe licensees, ituses a 68020 processor currently running at 22 MHz) and a math coprocessorchip for all rasterizing operations.andM;Unlike everyone else, Autologic does not use a Winchester disk to hold thepage bitmap; it builds the bitmap in a 48-MB RAM buffer.andP;  A disk is stillused for font storage.) The buffer comprises three ordinary 16-MB memoryboards of the sort sold by a number of vendors as expansion memory forAT-class computers.andP;  (Autologic salesmen like to say that the RIP has 58 MB:the 48-MB buffer holds 50,331,648 bytes, so it is thus called a 50-MB memory;add the 8 MB of the RIP's working memory to get the total.andP;  But the twomemories are physically separate and their functions cannot be mingled.)andM;The boards are housed in an AT-clone computer in a separate case from theAdobe Rm.andP;  The clone offers a nice user interface for setting RD parameterslike resolution, page size, right- or wrong-reading film and so forth.andO;During rasterizing, the clone's monitor provides a nice graphic display ofthe progress of the job,andM;Considering where the price of memory is heading, we think that other vendorsneeding high-performance RIPs will consider this approach.andP;  It provides aclear tradeoff of cost for speed: an 80-MB Winchester disk costs an oEm about$500-700, while each megabyte of RAM costs about $70-100, or about$3,500-5,000 for a 48-MB buffer.andP;  The latter cost will continue to fall unless the Commerce Department decides to &quot;protect&quot; us from imported chips),making the use of RAM buffers increasingly attractive where speed isimportant.andM;BertholdandM;The company.andP;  Berthold has had a relatively low profile in North America inrecent years, but is quite well known in Europe.andP;  Indeed, it is one of thelargest suppliers of typesetting systems worldwide, with a particular focuson the needs Of top-quality typographers.andP;  Its main product line, the MSeries includes a composition system running on Sun workstations, drivingeither an ECRM Pelbox 2000 or Berthold's own CRT marking engine.andM;PostScript capability is a relatively recent part of Berthold's product line.andO;It is not the core of the company's strategic direction, though it is morethan a mere afterthought.andP;  Its main role, we think, is to reassureprospective M Series customers that they won't be frozen out of thePostScript world and will be able to handle PostScript jobs that theirclients might bring in.andM;In North America, Berthold is now principally sold and serviced by PierreGravel Enterprises.andP;  Gravel has exclusive marketing rights in Canada;technically, he has only non-exclusive rights for the rest of the continent,but in the absence of U.S.andP;  competition, that is rather a moot issue.andO;Product tested.andP;  Berthold's PostScript imagesetter is based on the PelBox2000, and is driven by the Sofha RD. (The name Sofha is said to derive from acontraction of &quot;software' and &quot;hardware.&quot;) The software runs on a 68020 cpuaugmented by specialized hardware for dot generation.andP;  The RIP is currentlyequipped with 8 MB of RAM, but future versions will offer an option to expandthat to 16 MB.andM;The RIP is also equipped with a 380-MB hard disk.andP;  Some of this space is usedfor font storage, as you would expect.andP;  But the real reason for using such alarge disk is that you can keep a fair number of pages around after they havebeen typeset, and if desired, run them out again without rerasterizing.andP;  Thismeans that if the film gets jammed in the processor, a new film can morequickly be produced.andP;  In principle, it would also be possible to havemultiple RIPs alternating between filling their disk buffers and recording onfilm, but Berthold has not marketed -such a configuration.andM;At this writing, the Sofhia interpreter is able to run only Type 3 PostScriptfonts.andP;  Berthold prefers to emphasize its own Diamond fonts, identical tothose in M Series products, which have been translated directly from theDiamond format into PostScript Type 3 outlines without any hints or regularizing.&quot; About 400 of the 1,200 Diamond fonts have been translated intoPostScript format, and Berthold has said that it will have 800 by the end ofthis year.andP;  Alternatively, any third-party Type 3 fonts can be used.andM;ChelgraphandM;The company.andP;  As most of our readers already know, Chelgraph was one ofseveral companies founded by former Linotype employees after Linotype closeda substantial portion of its research and development operation inCheltenham, England.andP;  The company's history has been the source of someconfusion lately, so we'll try to state concisely how it got where it istoday:andM;* 1983: Chelgraph Ltd. was founded by Derek Kyte, Bill Davy, John Brooks, RodCraig and Peter Cadogan, all formerly with Linotype.andP;  Its initial focus wason research and development for other graphic arts companies, including bothhardware and software.andM;* 1985: Cheigraph Products was founded as a joint venture between ChelgraphLtd. and Monotype for the purpose of manufacturing and distribution of IBXtypesetters developed by Chelgraph Ltd.andM;* 1987: De La Rue, parent of Crosfield, acquired control of Chelgraph Ltd. bygaining 75% of the company, but Chelgraph continued to operate as anindependent company.andM;* April 1989: Monotype's 67% ownership of Chelgraph Products was sold to DeLa Rue, to be merged into Chelgraph Ltd.andM;* July 1989: De La Rue sold its Crosfield and Chelgraph subsidiaries to ajoint venture between Du Pont and Fuji Photo Film Co. Du Pont and Fuji haveindicated an intention to keep Chelgraph separate from the Crosfieldoperation, but formal statements of direction are expected to clarify thestrategy in the near future.andM;Chelgraph currently employs 43 people in its Cheltenham facility, including20 in Randamp;D and 23 in production, assembly and testing.andP;  Managing DirectorDerek Kyte says the company has been profitable every year and that profitshave increased every year.andP;  Its products are sold only on an OEM basis, notto end users.andM;Among the company's early developments was a Modular RIP that ran the Acepage description language that was one of the early contenders for a PDLstandard.andP;  Although Ace is no longer viewed as an candidate to displacePostScript in that respect, it is still in use within several companies'products, including typesetters and printers produced by Berthold, Chelgraph,Itek, Monotype, Varityper, Xitron and Genicom.andM;Another of Chelgraph's notable products was the PTW composition systemrunning on IBM PCs, which was sold by Itek from 1985 to 1989.andM;Products.andP;  Chelgraph currently sells three models of its IBX typesetter line,each of which uses the Chelgraph RIP, but they are configured with differentrecording engines: the W1000L, using the ECKM PelBox 108; the 2000, usingChelgraph's own raster cRT engine; and the 3000L, using ECRM's new 3,048-dpiPelBox.andM;The line also includes laser printers based on the same Ace RIP: A3-sized 400dpi and A4-sized 300-dpi devices equipped with Panasonic and Canon recordingengines, respectively.andM;One RIP can drive multiple recorders, both high and low resolution.andM;Chelgraph also offers a Low-Cost Graphic System (LCGS) that supportsscanning, display and manipulation of line art and continuous-tone images,using a  386 PC controller.andP;  Chelgraph's Graphics Integration Module (GIM)takes images from the LCGS or another graphics database, merges them withtext and other raster data from a RIP and outputs complete pages to animaging device.andM;PostScript.andP;  Chelgraph has developed a Universal RIP that accommodates boththe Ace and PostScript page description languages.andP;  The same basic RD drivesthe plain-paper Copal engine and the family of high-resolution recorders,although in the former case the RIP is housed in a small cabinet on top ofthe engine, while in the latter, the RIP stands in a tower with a VME frameable to accommodate optional hardware enhancements.andM;The RIP hardware is based on a Motorola 88000 RISC processor with 4 (in theCopal) or 8 MB of memory and a hard disk with 40 (Copal) or 150 MB of diskstorage available, such as for optional Kanji program.andM;PostScript input is interpreted by means of software supplied byHyphen-virtually the same software Hyphen uses in its own systems.andP;  Chelgraphdeveloped its own hardware to ran the Hyphen software to try to minimize thecost of the RIP.andM;The Copal device, which Chelgraph calls the PPT 600, prints on A3-size (11&quot; x17&quot;) paper at a speed of 6 pages per minute, or A4 sheets at 12 ppm.andP;  Thequality looks good for a plain-paper engine.andP;  It uses write-black,dual-component-toner technology with a spot size of about 2 mils (60microns).andP;  Toner is supplied in cartridges that last about 5,000 copies.andP;  Theengine rating is 500 impressions per day and 600,000 total.andP;  The carriercomponent in the toner has a duty cycle of 50,000 impressions.andM;Chelgraph also sells a PostScript translator, called Pace, that takesPostScript code and converts it to Ace language to drive an output device.andO;It is appropriate for text and line art, which it can handle faster than afull PostScript interpreter.andP;  We didn't test Pace.andM;We had hoped to test the whole Chelgraph line, but the high-resolution modelsweren't ready to be tested when we visited the Chelgraph headquarters inCheltenham, UK, on Jan. 31.andP;  Chelgraph has advised us that these machineswill be ready for testing within two weeks, though, so we should be able toadd them soon.andP;  We are leaving space on our chart for these machines soreaders can write them into the main chart when they are available.andP;  In thisissue, we are reporting the times for Chelgraph's 600-dpi Copal plain-papermachine, though, which should provide some idea of the speed of the ChelgraphRD, particularly in comparison with the other 600-pi machines.andM;HyphenandM;Not only is Hyphen the source of the fastest PostScript interpreter on themarket, but it has ported its code to more platforms than anyone else in thehigh-resolution world.andP;  (At the low end, 300 dpi and below, CAI has therecord for both output devices driven and platforms ported to.) We timed someof Hyphen's products in round 1 of these tests; we are updating the numbersfor the Mac RIP and the hardware RIP/ECRM 108S combination here and addingnew numbers for the 386 PC and SparcStation RIPs.andM;Configuration choices.andP;  One of the interesting things about the Hyphensoftware RIPs is that the allocation of computer memory to image buffer, tintbuffer and VM (the region of memory that holds downloaded fonts and thePostScript page description itself, among other things) is user settable.andO;Depending on the job and the total amount of memory, the size of these memoryallocations can make a big difference in the speed of the RIP.andM;For example, in our test of the 386 PC RIP, the TROUT file took much longerthan we would have expected from the way other jobs behaved.andP;  In order to runthe 35FONTs job, we had increased the size of VM at the expense of imagememory.andP;  This caused a performance loss on TROUT, which needs lots of imagememory.andP;  Running the same jobs through the Mac RIP, we stopped to readjustthe memory configuration before running TROUT.andP;  Hence, it appears that theMac RIP does a much faster TROUT than the PC Rip, when what is really goingon is that the Mac RIP was just better tuned.andM;There are several ways you could look at this:andM;* Hyphen is the only vendor that lets you configure the machine; all otherssurely have methods of allocating memory, but they are inaccessible to theuser.andM;* If you run many different kinds of work, you will find it a pain toreconfigure the machine for each job.andP;  You have to quit the Pip application,fire up a text editor, change some mysterious parameters in the configurationfile, then restart the RIP program.andP;  Hyphen says that the next upgrade winallow you to change parameters within the program.andM;* The true cure to the problem is to install more memory.andP;  We tested the 1386PC with 8 MB installed.andP;  The PCs that Hyphen recommends can hold at least 16MB, and adding memory is a matter of plugging in more SIMMs.andP;  (In fact,Hyphen recommends running the PC RIP with 16 MB rather than 8 MB, and theprice it quotes for the PC RIP is based on a 16-MB machine.) With the extrachips, all of the memory allocations can be generously increased.andM;The Mac RIP is temporarily limited to 8 MB by Apple's current System 6software.andP;  When System 7 arrives (which Apple has promised win happen thissummer) you will be able to stuff a Mac with up to 32 MB.andM;SparcStation futures.andP;  Hyphen was quite disappointed with the performance wemeasured on the SparcStation.andP;  Although the SparcStation RIP has been shippedto several customers, it is still officially in beta-test status.) Theprogrammers had hoped for much faster times, considering the availablecomputing horsepower.andP;  It turns out that there are two areas that still needto be optimized: the SCSI buffer and the Unix virtual memory.andM;Fixing those two things, said Hyphen, would double the speed of the RIP.andP;  Ofcourse, Hyphen cannot make any changes in the Unix operating system software;those bugs will have to be fixed by Sun Microsystems, and Sun has said thatthe fix will be as part of the next release, due in April.andM;More interesting, however, is that the current SpareStation is only the firstof a line of Sparc-based workstations.andP;  Sun has more powerful SparcStationsunder development.andP;  In addition, because there is a binary standard for Sparccomputers, there is also a degree of price and feature competition amongseveral compatible machines from other vendors.andP;  Presumably any of thesemachines could run the Hyphen RIP software; the user will be able to selectthe price and performance points he wants from an expanding array of choices.andM;This spells the eventual end of the Hyphen hardware RIP, which is based onAMD bit-slice chips.andP;  Sparc- and MIPS-based workstations (e.g., theDECstation, which Hyphen also supports) have not yet caught up to theperformance that the bit-slices turn out, but they will  in a year or two.andO;Like any piece of specialized hardware, the Hyphen hardware RIP is expensive;it will not be long until general-purpose workstations are morecost-effective, and not long after that until they are out-and-out faster.andM;This is, of course, the argument in favor of standard platforms for anypublishing system, and the basis of the fourth-wave transformation of theindustry.andP;  Hyphen is as aware of this as any vendor, and does not plan to becaught napping.andM;Linotype's RIP 4andM;Linotype's products were tested in our first round, but since then the finnhas brought out the RIP 4.andP;  It is functionally similar to the RIP 3, but hasa hardware math accelerator and a higher-bandwidth data connection betweenthe RIP and the recorder.andP;  In addition, the machine is now equipped withAdobe's version 51.8 ROMS.andM;We therefore reran our tests using a pre-release version of the new RIP 4.andO;As can be expected in pre-release software, we encountered a few glitches(which we understand have been fixed), but on the whole we think the RIP 4 isa worthwhile upgrade to the RIP 3.andM;RIP 3 vs 4.andP;  At lower resolutions, the benefit of the RIP 4 is minor, but athigh resolution the improved hardware pays off.andP;  (Owners of the L500imagesetter will appreciate the ability to reach the higher resolution.)andO;Linotype also says that larger halftones show the improvement moredramatically; since the pictures in our tests were no larger than 3 1/2&quot;square, this will not show up here.andM;To see the difference, lees compare September's numbers for the RIP 3 withthe latest numbers measured with RIP 4.andM;MONO1     NO PIX    WITH PIX    TROUTandM;L300andM;RIP 4, 1270 dpi      4:28      3:08      10:12       17:08andM;RIP 3                5:29      3:13      10:24       17:06andM;RIP 4, 2540 dpi      8:01     14:38andM;RIP 3               14:12     20:20andM;L500andM;RIP 4, 1270 dpi      5:50      3:53      10:50       17:45andM;RIP 3                6:52      4:00      11:14       18:45andM;RIP 4, 1693 dpi      7:14     14:17andM;RIP 3                9:18     14:40andM;Ethernet option.andP;  Linotype has also recently begun shipping an Ethernetoption for its RIPS.andP;  This can be retrofitted to either a RIP 3 or a PIP 4.andO;Comparing the same job sent via Localtalk or Ethernet, we found that there ishardly any difference on small jobs, which would include nearly all filescontaining only text and line art.andP;  On these jobs, the time to transmit datais so short with either medium that a speedup simply isn't noticeable.andM;It is also true that Apple's programmers did an excellent job in designingLocaltalk.andP;  Although the nominal bandwidth is only 230,000 bits per second(versus 10 million bits per second for Ethernet), that bandwidth is used veryefficiently.andP;  In contrast, Ethernet protocols are much less efficient; as aquick approximation, only 10% of the theoretical data capacity is reallyavailable after all the overhead is dealt with.andM;However, halftones require that a great deal of raw data must be transmittedbetween the composition system and the RIP; the data transmission time canbecome a significant fraction of the job time.andP;  This became apparent when weran the WITG PIX job (which would be even greater if there were morehalftones in the job.andM;L300, RIP 4,1270 dpi       NO PIX      WITH PIXandM;Localtalk               3:08        10:12andM;Ethernet                3:08         8:50andM;These numbers are somewhat deceiving in one respect.andP;  They only measure thetotal time to get one job printed.andP;  What they don't tell you is how soon youget your Mac back after starting a print job, so you can start setting up thenext file.andP;  Although we did not measure this factor with a stopwatch, we didnotice that the Ethernet connection frees up the Macintosh (or other frontend) a good bit sooner.andP;  You still have to wait until the next-to-last pagehas been imaged (Ethernet does not provide any spooling or queueingfunctions), but you don't have to wait very long for the final page to betransmitted to the Pip.andP;  Again, this factor is more important when the pagecontains large amounts of halftone data.andM;ScangraphicandM;In our earlier report, we included the Scangraphic 2051 at standardresolution (1,625 dpi).andP;  For this update, we visited the company at its UKoffice and added nearly a full set of tests at 813 dpi, which we think islikely to be viewed as much better than proof quality for many applications(see samples).andP;  It provides significantly greater speed than the 1,625-dpisetting, so it should be attractive.andP;  (On most of the tests, the machine tookbarely more than half the time at 813-dpi than at 1625.andM;We also reran the tests at standard resolution to check the current RIPfeatures, noticing some speed improvement.andM;We started to test the machine's highest resolution-3,251 dpi-but ran out oftime after finishing the MONO1 job in about 20 minutes and starting theTROUT.andP;  This is the highest resolution of any machine in our tests, so itisn't surprising that its speed is less than lightning fast.andP;  Our test of theTROUT file was halted in the middle when 45 minutes had elapsed and the 2051was less than half way through.andP;  We hope to provide full results at allresolutions next time.andM;The machine we tested was the 120-pica 2051, but the speed for the narrower2030 should be identical.andM;VarityperandM;Since our last report, Varityper has increased the speed of its RIP byincreasing the clock rate to 25 MHz, which is reflected in the new times onour chart.andP;  It is notable that the Varityper machine running at highresolution can output the graphics-oriented WITHPIX and TROUT files at aboutthe same speed as the new Agfa CG 9800, but that the Varityper unit is muchslower than the CG machine on text files.andM;New architecture.andP;  Varityper also has changed its system architecture toconfigure the RD in its own cabinet, from which it can drive multiplerecorders, including plain-paper and photographic devices.andP;  Instead of havinga plain-paper machine and the high-resolution 4200 and 4300 units, as used tobe the case, Varityper now offers a Series 4000 RD and a 5300 recorder, whichcan be purchased to run at a variety of resolutions.andP;  For plain-paper output,the 5060 engine is available, as discussed above.andM;This architecture provides greater flexibility and eliminates the need topurchase or license fonts multiple times.andP;  Varityper is quick to point outthat the system can be configured in a neat package including a qualityproofer and a high-resolution imager, and that the best measure of speedshould take into account both proofing time and final output time, whichcould be computed from our charts, not only for Varityper, but for some othercompanies as wen.andM;The have been no changes in the company's Series 5000 line-the former Tegrasystem that uses a CAI PostScript RIP.andM;PostScript GatewaysandM;No one in his right mind would buy a high-end color prepress system or anewspaper pagination/display ad system as a means of outputting PostScriptimages.andP;  If that's all you want to do, such a system is probably the leastcost-effective way to do it that anyone could imagine.andP;  It would be likecracking w with a saber saw-it would work, but one could hardly easy orefficient.andM;(In this section, most of what we say about color prepress systems applies aswell to the Triple-I newspaper system.andP;  It is the system architecture, notthe functionality, that is the common thread.)andM;Nonetheless, all three of the major color system vendors now can outputPostScript files and have found customers (that is, color separation houses)eager to buy their RIPs.andP;  There are a number of reasons why.andM;* Designers, who are the principal specifiers and purchasers of colorprinting, are increasingly using desktop-publishing software as their chosendesign medium.andP;  They want to lay out pages in PageMaker or Quark Xpress orDesignStudio, which have the advantages of good text handling and low systemcost, then hand the work to the color separator for the production steps thatdesktop systems don't yet do well.andM;* Color shops, in turn, do not want to lose business to desktop systems, evenfor run-of-the-mill color work.andP;  A customer that decides he can do his ownlow-end color today might decide to do his own better-quality jobs tomorrow;there are a number of vendors catering to the &quot;good enough' color market whosee their desktop systems supplanting, not just supplementing, the colortrade shops.andP;  Accepting a full range of jobs means that color shops can holdon to their customers better.andM;Although color shops can no longer charge their clients for the routine workof copying a comp or, layout sketch into the color system, they can recoupthe lost revenue by concentrating their personnel on the skilled operationsof scanning and retouching.andM;* By the same token, color shops can develop new customers by taking workfrom desktop systems.andP;  As desktop publishers push up against the limits ofcurrent technology, they will seek out ways of improving the quality ofresults they can achieve.andP;  At that point, they are ripe to become steadyclients of a color shop, especially one that offers a full range of services:high-res scanning, retouching, page assembly and film output, along withconsulting services, staff artists, referrals to printers and so forth.andM;The solution that meets all these needs is to make the PostScript RIP act asa gateway into the color system.andP;  The reason you need a RIP is that colorsystems are optimized for processing scanned images-that is, raster data.andO;The RIP converts the mathematical outlines of the type and the vectorgraphics into a bitmap so that the color system can process it as an image.andO;It also encodes the bitmap in the appropriate format; although the detailsdiffer, all three color systems use some form of run-length encoding for datacompression.andM;In effect, the PostScript RIP acts as a scanner, as far as the overall systemarchitecture is concerned.andP;  In fact, before the development of such gateways,the best way to get text into a color system was often to run it through atypesetter, then mount the resulting galley on a drum scanner and scan itinto the system as a graphic.) However, the RT can do more; it can alsoprepare a page-geometry file that specifies the location of color images andtint blocks.andM;OPI.andP;  In one idealized scenario, a designer would select his photos and havethem scanned at high resolution on the color system.andP;  The system operatorwould perform any required color correction and retouching, using his bestprofessional judgment and skill and the considerable power of his equipment.andO;Then he would generate a set of low-resolution viewfiles in one of the commondesktop scanner formats---probably color TIFF.andP;  These low-res files would becopied to floppy disk and handed to the designer to use as position stats.andM;The designer would then lay out the page using a desktop publishing system.andO;He would print the comps on a 300-dpi color PostScript printer; the compswould be used to obtain the necessary approvals, and would have all text andvector art (such as Encapsulated PostScript files from other applications) inplace.andP;  The color photos would be positioned, scaled and cropped as thoughthey were final artwork, but would not be judged for color rendition.andP;  Whenthe design was complete, the designer would RIP it into the color system.andO;However, instead of rasterizing the color images, the RIP would ignore themand issue a set of instructions to the color system, telling it to substitutethe original high-res images.andM;To this end, Aldus has proposed the Open Prepress Interface, a standardized,extensible convention (based on the Adobe structured PostScript comments) forpassing information between a desktop publishing program and a color system.andO;The OPI comments that the desktop program puts into its PostScript output canbe interpreted by a well-programmed RIP, even though they do not cause anyPostScript imaging to take place.andP;  Such comments could be used toautomatically link the names of color graphic files in the desktop systemwith the corresponding high-res files in the color system.andP;  Carrying the ideaeven further, the OPI comments might carry instructions (for furtherretouching, for special effects such as vignetting or ghosting multipleimages) that the color system could automatically carry out.andM;All three color vendors have expressed support for Aldus's OPI, although theyhave also spoken of the need for additional work to make the standard morecomplete.andP;  None of the three has a full implementation at this point.andM;Timings.andP;  It is difficult to give an accurate idea of how fast these systemsare.andP;  We were able to measure rasterizing speeds quite easily, but that'sonly one part of the total throughput picture.andP;  The line-work file that comesout of the RIP must then be passed to other computers in the system foradditional processing and final output to film.andP;  These operations are done asbackground tasks, possibly on multiple processors.andP;  Along the way, the systemoperator is likely to manipulate the image in various ways-that being thewhole point of feeding the file into a color system (or a newspaperpagination system).andP;  If all you want is straight PostScript output, youshould be using an imagesetter.andP;  In fact, many color shops keep an L300 or CG9600 around for just such purposes.andP;  The upshot is that the numbers we havecollected are not sufficient to compare the speeds of different systems.andM;That's OK, we think, because few color shops are going to pick a new colorsystem on the basis of its PostScript  input gateway sped.andP;  The gateway is aminor adjunct to a much larger operation.andP;  The numbers will, however, giveand clients some idea of the rasterizing time for various of jobs, and thusof the incremental costs and benefits of a PostScript gateway approach tocolor.andM;Scitex Visionary and VIPandM;Scitex was the first of the color vendors to take advantage of the Macintosh,offering the Visionary design system to members of the Scitex User Group, whoin turn remarket it to their customers.andP;  Visionary is a customized version ofQuark Xpress; it reads and writes a unique file format that is not compatiblewith any off-the-shelf versions of Quark.andP;  The program takes full advantageof the Xtension capability built into Xpress by including 21 Xtensions.andM;The Visionary package includes hardware: a Mac IICX with 8 MB of memory andan 80-MB disk drive, a Mitsubishi 300-dpi color printer, a Sharp desktopscanner and a Telebit Trailblazer modem.andP;  The package also includes 155Bitstream fonts.andM;Each Visionary package costs the User Group member $3,000 for software.andP;  Ifhis client does not already have the proper hardware, he can obtain the Mac,the printer and the scanner at any nearby Nynex computer store; the UserGroup has worked out a national agreement with Nynex.andP;  The User Group memberthen resells the equipment to his clients for any price he chooses to charge.andO;Since the point of the exercise is to bring in more color business, somemembers have actually given the equipment to their clients at no charge.andM;As an alternative, the member can offer his client a lesser package calledVisionary Junior.andP;  This is the same proprietary version of Xpress, but hasfewer Xtensions and is designed to run on a Mac SE.andM;At the color shop, the User Group member needs a Visionary Gateway.andP;  Thissystem includes all the hardware and software of a Visionary, and adds thehardware and software for a two-way GPIB interface to the Scitex Responsesystem.andP;  Scitex charges $87,000 for a Gateway, which includes one week ofoperator training and ongoing technical support.andM;VIP.andP;  So far we haven't said anything about PostScript.andP;  The VisionaryGateway does not require PostScript at all, provided the clients are willingto use only the proprietary version of Xpress.andP;  The Visionary Gateway handlesall the necessary format conversions.andP;  It is only when the clients want touse other desktop publishing packages that PostScript comes  into the story,and for that, the color shop needs an optional piece of software called VIP,the Visionary Interface to PostScript.andM;VIP is an Adobe software RD that runs in the Macintosh.andP;  It can accept inputfrom most desktop publishing applications, transforming the PostScript codeinto the Scitex line-work format; the line-work file is then sent through theGateway over to the Response system.andP;  VIP is priced at $8,000.andM;In operation, VIP first inspects the incoming file to determine whether ithas the necessary fonts.andP;  It then rasterizes the file at 72 dpi for displayon the Mac screen.andP;  This is not just to give the operator something to lookat; the current version of VIP is not smart enough to figure out how big theimage really is, so the operator can use the Mac's mouse to draw a croppingrectangle.andP;  (Version 2, we were told, will look at the PostScript commentsfor a bounding-box command.) The VIP will then re-rasterize the PostScriptcode at higher resolution, limiting its efforts to the cropping rectangle soas not to waste disk space.andM;VIP does not, however, perform any screening of tints or contone images.andP;  Itpasses that data out to the Scitex system, whose dot-generation circuitry ismuch faster and offers better quality than current PostScript technology.andO;The VIP also imposes a couple of limitations on what can be transferred.andP;  TheAdobe interpreter restricts the total image size to 32K x 32K pixels (about18&quot; x 18&quot; at 1800 dpi), while the data compression scheme of the Scitex LWformat allows only 256 colors (or gray levels) per image.andP;  If an image mustshow more colors, the PostScript file can be run through Adobe Separator andeach separation layer can be rasterized separately; the layers can then besuperimposed in the Scitex system.andM;This limitation, by the way, is found in all the PostScript gateways, notjust Scitex's.andP;  It is built into the way run-length codes are defined.andP;  Itshould not pose any problem for an artist who consciously designs pages for acolor system, since it mainly affects scanned images and blended tints orvignettes.andP;  However, as we have pointed out above, gateway systems start fromthe premise that the fancy color effects will be executed on the colorsystem; the desktop system is only used for text, vector art and pagegeometry.andM;Crosfield StudioLinkandM;Crosfield's StudioLink is conceptually similar to Scitex's Visionary, exceptthat it uses Letraset's ReadySetGo instead of Quark Xpress.andP;  (Crosfield willalso support Letraset's Design-Studio.) However, unlike Visionary, theStudioLink version of RSG is completely compatible with the off-the-shelfRSG, so that clients of a Crosfield color shop can obtain their software fromany mail-order or retail outlet.andM;Whether it is a good idea to &quot;lock in&quot; clients with proprietary software andincompatible file formats is a debate that has been pretty well settled inother parts of the publishing industry.andP;  It will be interesting to see how itplays in the high-end color arena; Crosfield and Hell plan to make it one oftheir competitive arguments.andM;At the moment, however, Crosfield is not in a good position to begin anattack on this ground.andP;  Its PostScript gateway needs different input filtersfor specific desktop publishing programs.andP;  The RSG filter is well along indevelopment and is fairly robust.andP;  A Quark Xpress filter has just begun thetesting process.andP;  Filters for PageMaker, Illustrator, Freehand and variousother Mac programs (let alone the software running on PCs) have yet to bewritten.andP;  As we understand it, the problem is not in the PostScript Re (whichis a Hyphen interpreter running on a Sun 386i) but in the software thatmatches images in the desktop program with their high-res counterparts on thecolor system.andM;Data flow.andP;  In Crosfield's preferred scenario, the process of designing thepage begins with scanning the pictures on the MagnaScan and storing the datain the File Management System for later use.andP;  At this point, a programrunning in a Sun 386i (perhaps the same box that hosts the PostScript RD)converts the high-res data into 72-dpi Color Palette TIFF files and passesthem over a Tops network to a Macintosh IIx.andP;  The files are then written onfloppy disks and handed to the designer, who will treat them as positionstats.andP;  The designer then lays out the pages, prints proofs on a desktopcolor printer and obtains whatever approvals are required.andM;When the completed RSG or DesignStudio file comes back to the color shop, itis printed through the Scripter/PS PostScript RIP.andP;  The text is rasterizedinto a Crosfield DTE-format image, the EPS graphics are turned into C-filldata, and the overall page geometry is converted to CPP data.andP;  TheScripter/PS software also matches up the TIFF images on the page with thecorresponding high-res files in the File Management System.andP;  At this point,the FMS can automatically assemble the color pages, separate them and recordthe seps on film.andP;  Alternatively, some pages might be routed to the StudioCCS color retouching station for further hand operations.andM;Our test.andP;  The StudioLink software is not finished, so we were not able torun our tests in any formal way.andP;  Our pure-PostScript cookbook files(CLIPPATH, SMALL and ROSETTE) lacked a proper header of structured PostScriptcomments, while our PageMaker and Freehand files required a filter thathasn't been written yet.andP;  For that reason, there is no line in the chart forCrosfield.andM;However, it turns out that there is a workaround for PagcMaker files.andP;  It ispossible to print each page to disk as a PostScript file, then import eachpage into Aldus Freehand.andP;  Freehand apparently is able to accept PageMaker'soutput, although most other applications can't.andP;  Then you save the Free-handpage as an EPS file, which in turn can be imported as a graphic intoReadySetGo.andP;  You can then run the RSG document through Scripter/PS.andM;We suspect that rasterizing such a document would not be the same asrasterizing a page originally composed in RSG.andP;  However, for what theinformation is worth, we went through the above process with our NO Pix file.andO;This file contains just text and page geometry information in the form ofblack masks to show where halftones will be placed.andP;  We measured the RIP timefor two pages at 22 minutes 30 seconds.andP;  We then called up the resulting fileon the Studio CCS and played with it, dropping in color images (from the demoroom stock art disk) and colorizing text, etc.andM;Our impression is that when it is complete, Crosfield's approach will be veryslick for those applications that are supported with filters.andP;  (One of thefilters win be a  generic&quot; design.) But unsupported desktop programs may beproblematic.andP;  However, like the other color vendors, Crosfield is workingtoward a full OPI implementation, which should simplify things greatly whenit is complete.andM;Hell ScriptMasterandM;Hell is focusing its PostScript efforts on an open-system approach, incontrast to Scitex's proprietary version of Xpress and even Crosfield'scurrent preference for ReadySetGo and Design-Studio.andP;  It is true that Hellhas made some alliances with Aldus (have you noticed how the big three colorvendors have each aligned with one of the big three Mac-based desktopsystems?), but its gateway makes no assumptions about the applicationgenerating the PostScript code.andM;Like Crosfield, Hell is using the Hyphen software RIP, in this case runningin a Siemens workstation, which is a private-label version of the Apollo3500.andP;  Hell has written the queuing and flow-control software for the Apollo,and the newest release lets the Apollo act as an AppleShare server, whichmeans the Mac can access files stored on the Unix workstation.andM;Although the software is complete, it is technically still in beta testing.andO;It has been installed by eight Hell customers: five separation houses andthree commercial printers.andM;Data flow.andP;  The current process sends data one-way from the desktoppublishing program through the RD to the Hell M-Series computer.andP;  At the RIP,the major decision is at what resolution to rasterize the data.andP;  The standardresolution is 300 dpi for contone images; this matches the resolutionnormally used on the Hell scanner.andP;  Text is normally rasterized at six timesthe standard resolution, or 1,800 dpi.andP;  However, where the text will bemerged into a color image (as a knockout or blend) and halftoned, there is noneed to operate at such high resolution, and lower resolutions save time.andO;The RIP automatically crops the output file to minimize unused white space.andM;Once the image has been passed into the Hell system, it must be run throughthe KONTI process, a contour-generation step that all line work is subjectedto.andP;  The operator prepares a KTD specification file for each page ofPostScript output, then sends the job off for background processing.andP;  Thisprocessing takes a variable amount of time, depending on page complexity andsystem loading; we timed one page of the MON01 job at I minute 38 seconds.andO;If there is any special processing to be done-scanned images to be dropped inand possibly retouched, text to be colorized, vignettes to be applied-it canbe handled on the ChromaCom editing station.andP;  Final dot generation and outputto film is then done as a background process.andM;As with the other color vendors, Hell sees no reason to perform complexoperations like blended tints with a desktop system.andP;  (The TROUT is such ajob; on all the imagesetters we measured, it takes a long time to PiP.) Itwould make more sense, Hell says, to use the desktop system to delineate theregion where a special effect is required, then implement the effect in theChromaCom.andM;Color service bureaus.andP;  Hell has begun test-marketing the concept of a colorservice bureau, the color analog of a typesetting service bureau.andP;  As its adin Aldus Magazine tells it, the designer first prepares his layout usingdesktop publishing programs such as Freehand and PageMaker.andP;  Then send yourjobs on diskette, along with your original color artwork, to your Hell ColorService Bureau.andP;  They'll do the rest.- That is, the service bureau willhandle the details of color scanning, color correction and balancing, GCR,and UCR, and output as high-quality separation films.andM;As we sec it, the appeal of this is twofold.andP;  First, most designers arealready familiar with a variety of service bureaus for typesetting,photography, clip art and so on.andP;  There is an implicit economic bargain: youpay only for the amount of service you actually need, and do as much of thework yourself as you want to.andP;  Second, the service bureau can be poised tosen consulting and technical advice as well as output.andP;  Hell is working onways to support its users as they begin to branch out in these directions.andM;Information InternationalandM;Although the Triple-I system is mainly oriented to monochrome newspaperproduction*, its PostScript product has most of the characteristics of acolor system gateway.andP;  The PSI PostScript RIP &quot;looks like&quot; a scanner to therest of the production system in that it delivers the same V-bit rasterformat that the Triple-I scanner produces.andP;  The resulting image file israrely output directly; more typically it is one component of a newspaperpage, either an advertisement that was made up at an outside art agency orartwork for an ad that the newspaper will make.andP;  And the time required toprocess the file depends mostly on what else is going on elsewhere in thesystem.andM;For that reason, we placed the Triple-I timing numbers in the PostScriptgateway chart rather than in the imagesetter chart.andP;  As with the colorsystems, no one is going to buy a Triple-I system just to print PostScriptfiles, but a Triple-I-based newspaper might look at the costs and benefits ofadding a PostScript solution to an existing system.andM;Configuration.andP;  Triple-I uses the CAI PostScript interpreter running in aSun-3 workstation.andP;  Files can be piped into the Sun in a variety of ways; forMacintosh connectivity, III supports the Kinetics FastPath bridge, whichconnects Local-talk networks to TCP/IP Ethernet.andP;  It uses Mount Xinu's KSpoolutility to emulate several &quot;virtual LaserWriters&quot;; each virtual LaserWriteris really a setup file for the RIP, allowing the user to call for differentresolutions, output queues, etc.andM;As each PostScript job arrives in the PSI, a Unix daemon (background process)queues it for rasterizing.andP;  The output of the RIP is a run-length-codedbitmap in the native Triple-I V-bit format.andP;  V-bit is a variable-lengthcoding scheme that uses anywhere from 4 to 24 bits per data element.andP;  Theelements are always multiples of four bits long; since four bits is half abyte, it is called a nybble, and you will sometimes hear this coding systemreferred to as a nybble code.) This output is directed via Ethernet to theINP, which is Triple-I's database manager.andP;  A daemon in the INP builds a jobjacket for the image and creates a low-res viewfile so that the job can bepassed to other workstations for ad makeup, page assembly and final output.andM;Rasterizing can be specified for any resolution between 160 and 2400 dpi.andO;The idea is to rasterize text at the resolution at which you intend to recordit, thus minimizing problems when the output typesetter re-rasterizes thepage.andP;  Triple-I recommends that halftones should be rasterized with aresolution at least 12 times the halftone screen frequency.andM;The RIP need not have its own dedicated Sun workstation.andP;  Depending onexpected system loading, the PostScript interpreter could run in the INP(which is also a Sun workstation) or in the Graphix Connection workstation.andO;But because rasterizing is so CPU-intensive, III recommends a separate Sunwherever possible.andM;Information International charges $27,500 for the PostScript interpretersoftware.andP;  The recommended Sun-3 workstation 20-MHz 68020 and a math chip, 8MB of memory and a 327-MB disk, backup tape drive, Ethernet interface andTriple-I's modified version of Sun Unix) is priced at $26,670.andM;Peter E. DysonandM;Another View of the Comparison ChartsandM;By David R. SpencerandM;The Comparison Chart lists the measured time for eight test documents.andP;  Analternate way of viewing the results would be to compare speed.andP;  And sincethroughput is such a strong function of addressable resolution, some methodof normalizing for this imperfect measure of quality may be desired.andM;Converting throughput from time to speed is a reciprocal function.andP;  Minutesper document becomes documents per minute; the shortest time becomes thehighest speed.andP;  In the accompanying chart, the data has also been factoredfor the number of pages in each test document, and scaled from minutes tohours.andP;  This results in a consistent speed measurement for all documents inpages per hour.andP;  Film imagesetters cover a wide range of speed, from 1.2pages per hour up to more than 95 pages per hour; lower-resolutionplain-paper imagesetters are even faster.andM;While it is clear that it would also be valuable to normalize speed for theeffects of different addressable resolution, no simple normalizing equationis valid for all RIP.andP;  Some RIP functions, such as display-list creation, areindependent of resolution; some RIP functions, such as pixel generation, areproportional to the resolution squared.andP;  Interestingly, normalizing speedproportionally with linear resolution appears to fit the resultant datareasonably well, as shown in the right portion of the accompanying chart.andO;Speed is multiplied by the RMS square root of the product of horizontal andvertical) resolution over 1,000.andP;  In support of this proposal, the normalizedspeed of the CG 9400 at a 1:2 resolution ratio is 39.5:40.4 when runningNOPIX and 21.4:20.5 when running TROUT; for the L200 at a 3:4 resolutionratio, it is 45.4:46.1 when running NOPIX but 13.7:6.0 when running TROUT.andO;This last ratio demonstrates some limitation with this normalization, or inthe timing.andM;The speed results for WITHPIX are shown graphically below.andP;  The speed resultsfor the other four test documents tabulated in the accompanying chart areshown graphically overleaf.andP;  Darker bars indicate addressable resolutions ofat least 1,800 dpi; plain-paper machines are also differentiated.andM;David R.
