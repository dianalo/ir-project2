The provision, adopted by voice vote, could be embarrassing for Mr. Reagan, coming just days before Kuwaiti Prime Minister Sheik Sabah is to visit here.    But proponents argue that the provision was an attempt to compromise since it would prohibit the sale of only two models of the air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles that can be used at night and are more sophisticated than versions earlier sold to other Middle East nations. The provision would still allow the sale of less-advanced Mavericks. &quot;It could be a lot worse,&quot; said a Republican congressional aide.    The ban, offered by Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), wouldn't affect the rest of the $1.9 billion package of arms sales to Kuwait that Mr. Reagan sent to Capitol Hill yesterday. Included in the proposed sale are 40 F-18 planes and more than 500 missiles, including 200 Mavericks.    Mr. DeConcini originally sought a complete ban on Mavericks to any nation bordering the Persian Gulf, but agreed to the limited ban after negotiations on the Senate floor with GOP lawmakers led by Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar.    The provision is part of a $14.3 billion foreign aid bill for the year beginning Oct. 1 that lawmakers approved on a 75-15 vote.    While considering the measure, lawmakers agreed by voice vote to an amendment threatening to block $20 million of the nearly $90 million in economic aid designated for Costa Rica because of a longstanding dispute between a U.S. businessman and the Costa Rican government.    The provision, which isn't part of the House-passed version of the bill, was sought by Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.). The lawyer for the businessman, identified by lawmakers as Royal Parker, is Washington attorney Scott Wilson, a former aide to Mr. Helms, senators said. Neither Messrs. Parker nor Wilson could be reached for comment. Sen. Helms is recovering from surgery.    Under the amendment, the money would have been blocked unless Costa Rica agreed to binding arbitration to settle the dispute, a condition Costa Rican officials yesterday told senators they would accept.    Some senators said the U.S. shouldn't get involved. &quot;We're turning the United States Senate into small claims court,&quot; complained Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.).    The bill includes $70.9 million that the Reagan administration requested for the first of six payments for the U.S. share of an increase in the World Bank's capital. The House had rejected the request.    Differences in the two measures will be reconciled by a House-Senate conference, which will have to deal with the Kuwaiti arms sale issues. Overall, the Senate-passed bill is $10.2 million more than the House version and $2.1 million more than the administration request.    Also yesterday, the Senate gave final congressional approval to a $17.8 billion measure to pay for federal energy and water projects in the coming fiscal year -- the first fiscal 1989 spending bill to clear Congress.    On a 91-3 vote, lawmakers sent the bill, which is a compromise between House and Senate versions, to President Reagan. The president is expected to sign it.    Overall, the measure would provide $917.4 million more than is currently being spent on energy and water projects and $312.6 million less than the Reagan administration had requested. </TEXT></DOC>
