RicksStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> HRSDEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN><TEXT>   Harris Corp. pleaded guilty to four felony counts of making false claims to the Army and agreed to pay about $4.3 million in restitution and penalties, as part of a plea agreement disclosed yesterday.    The disclosure of the plea follows by less than a month Harris's announcement to pay the U.S. government $1.3 million to settle a claim that it overcharged the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on a subcontract. Harris is a data-processing, communications and electronics concern based in Melbourne, Fla.    Walter Postula, a federal prosecutor in the Middle District of Florida, where the plea settlement was filed, said the two actions grew out of separate federal investigations but were settled together in a plea agreement signed in February but not disclosed until yesterday. The guilty plea was filed in federal court in Orlando.    In a news release, the U.S. attorney's office in Orlando said it had agreed to keep the agreement secret in order to give Harris an opportunity to resolve &quot;numerous defective pricing cases and suspected irregular conduct matters&quot; with various branches of the Defense Department. In addition to making payments to the Army to settle some of those disputes, Harris has deposited $4.5 million in an escrow account for the settlement of &quot;other matters that are still pending,&quot; the U.S. attorney's office said. A Harris spokesman said those other matters are &quot;normal cost and pricing issue negotiations,&quot; not still-undisclosed criminal proceedings.    Asked if any more federal investigations were under way against Harris, Mr. Postula said, &quot;I don't believe so.&quot;    The U.S. attorney's office also said Harris has implemented an in-house &quot;integrity-assurance program.&quot;    Harris said its plea bargain forecloses further criminal or civil prosecution of the company concerning the Army contract in question, which was awarded in March, 1981, for the supply of satellite-communication antennas and related equipment. However, Mr. Postula, the federal prosecutor, said the government still has the option of prosecuting the seven Harris employees involved in the Army contract case but hasn't decided whether to do so.    The U.S. attorney's office said that Harris was awarded the contract on a noncompetitive basis because of the company's expertise developed in fulfilling earlier, similar contracts. It said Harris certified to the government that it would cost the company about $54,000 to build each of 32 machines to guide the antennas, when Harris officials knew each machine would cost the company $16,000.    Harris also said it signed an agreement with the Army that ensured it wouldn't be barred from further government business.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Harris closed at $34.75 a share, down 87.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
