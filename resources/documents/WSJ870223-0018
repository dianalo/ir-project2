Many U.S. companies have been pulling out of South Africa because of protests over its apartheid policy, but Foster Wheeler declined to say whether that policy influenced its decision.    The engineering services company said the South African operations will be acquired by three local employees and will be able to continue using the Foster Wheeler name for a limited time. But the company declined to disclose terms of the transaction or provide details on the size of the South African operations. </TEXT></DOC>
