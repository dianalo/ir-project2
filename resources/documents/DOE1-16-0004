A buriedtracer layer is first radiatively heated to a few electron volts leadingto the appearance of bound-bound transitions near to the K photoabsorptionedge. Then as the shock runs through, the K edge shifts to lower energyionizing the bound-bound transitions, in agreement with theory.</TEXT></DOC>
