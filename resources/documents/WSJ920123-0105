The 29-year-old engineerarrived in Germany only two months ago, but he has alreadymanaged to find an apartment, a work permit, and a job as adriver in the Baden-Wurttemberg town of Singen. Now, though,this refugee from Yugoslavia stands in tears in a Saxonresettlement center hundreds of miles away from his new life.&quot;They moved me, and I don't know why,&quot; he says in brokenGerman. &quot;I want to get back to my job.&quot;   Mr. Smiljanic's displacement was a bureaucratic error --officials inadvertently collected him when they swept a townfor refugees. But his case is a symptom of what is fastbecoming Germany's number one domestic problem -- handlingforeigners. Before the Berlin Wall fell, the West Germangovernment did its best to slow arrivals, but afforded thosewho did get in the protection of its thick social-welfarenet. Now, though, refugees from Yugoslavia's civil war andimpoverished East Europe are straining that system.</LP><TEXT>   In 1991, a record 256,112 foreigners applied for asylum inGermany, an increase of 32.7% over 1990. And that figure doesnot include the several hundred thousand ethnic Germans whohave also arrived in Germany recently. The result has beenovert xenophobia strong enough to win international press andforce the government to re-evaluate its &quot;foreigner problem.&quot;   The German problem is really a European one. With theireconomies in shambles and regional violence looming, manyEastern Europeans dream of moving westward. They dream in thesame spirit as, at the turn of the century, Europeans dreamedof America. Europe faces a choice: treat the new arrivals asburdens or assets. If Europe chooses the former, it must facesocial unrest and the political extremism that grows from it.   &quot;There is hostility to foreigners here,&quot; says PeterMeisel, an official who works with foreigners in the Saxoncapital of Dresden, in what used to be East Germany. &quot;But youhave to see it in real terms. It is not a German or a Saxonproblem. It is an international problem now.&quot;   To spend an hour by Mr. Smiljanic's side at thePorschendorf center is to watch a bureaucracy functioning onoverload. Mr. Smiljanic stands in an airless hall, his papersin hand, hoping a social worker will stop to hear him out.Next door, 25 Yugoslavs argue at the top of their lungs witha lone official. They want the freedom to build lives inGermany's western states. But federal government rules saythey must resettle here, in grimy, job-poor Saxony. Bonn'spurpose is to distribute refugees evenly throughout Germany,but that nicety is lost on the foreigners. &quot;Passports],&quot;shouts a father whose baby bounces on his wife's shoulderbehind him. &quot;You can have your passport back,&quot; the embattledsocial worker shouts. &quot;But then you have to go home.&quot;   Control has long been the German watchword for managingimmigrants. Under German law, a German is someone who hasGerman blood -- anyone else is a &quot;foreigner&quot; and facesconsiderable barriers to citizenship. But the Germanconstitution also enshrines the right to political asylum.Sri Lankans, Kurds, Ethiopians and now, East Europeansapplying for asylum fill resettlement centers across thenation. The federal government frequently takes years to makeindividual decisions.   While the government decides, asylum candidates areentitled to some $6,250 annually in food, shelter, clothing-- but not, frequently, to the right to work. In Saxonyalone, there are 7,234 asylum candidates, housed at some 70sites. On those 7,234 pending cases, ambivalent officials hadby December made only three decisions: they accepted oneIraqi and sent home an Indian and a Romanian.   For citizens of a state like Saxony, where pensionersreceive as little as $450 a month, this handout policy ishard to take. Beyond the asylum candidates, other foreignersfill Saxony -- &quot;Eastern guestworkers&quot; who came years ago towhat was East Germany from Vietnam; Soviet Jews; andunregistered immigrants who live in Germany illegally.   All these groups occupy apartments in a region with ahousing shortage so acute the governor's ministers have tocamp out in the guestrooms of his residence. Officially,unemployment is 11%, but in reality it is far higher, withold communist firms breaking up and laying off up to 90% oftheir workers. Still in shock over the dissolution of theirold regime, eastern Germans worry that foreigners who benefitfrom public largess are cutting away from their own share ofthe federal pie.   The result of the pie mentality has been an upturn inviolence. After skinheads and neo-Nazis attacked a dormitoryof guestworkers in the small Saxon town of Hoyerswerda lastfall, the government cleared the town of foreigners and optedto spend more money: more than $1 million to build gates andkeep guards at dormitories elsewhere in the state.   Saxony's governor, Kurt Biedenkopf, is working to lightenthe state's load of asylum candidates: &quot;It's a politicaldecision which we are trying to correct.&quot; Showing typicalinconsistency on the issue, he also speaks of a likely laborshortage in coming years. His staff are quick to point outthat Saxony's neo-Nazis are more active than those in thewest because of economic hardship.   The federal government has produced a massive campaign toassure the world that today's anti-Turk window-busting andswastika parades will not build to a repeat of the nation'spast. On the anniversary of the Wannsee conference at whichNazi leaders planned the Holocaust, parliament president RitaSuessmuth urged citizens: &quot;Let's not kid ourselves] Allexperience shows: What we repress will catch up with us. Noone can elude his history.&quot;   But neither Mrs. Suessmuth, nor most other Germans arewilling to consider another option: giving up the Germanobsession with control, lowering subsidies, and allowing newarrivals to make their own way in the country. &quot;The situationhas changed but the policy hasn't,&quot; says MaritaSchieferdecker-Adolph, who works for the city of Dresdenhelping foreigners. &quot;They still say `Germany is not animmigration country.'&quot; She notes an ugly pecking order thathas developed throughout Germany -- West Germans pick onEastern Germans, who in turn pick on refugees. She makes aphilosophical point: &quot;Germany just doesn't get the notionthat you need new people.&quot;   Some argue that that feeling is an odd one, givenGermany's history. After the annihilation of Germany's Jewsand Gypsies, many Germans publicly -- and perhapshypocritically-mourned the loss of the diversity those groupsprovided. Guest-workers -- Italians, Turks and Yugoslavianswho arrived in the 1960s -- helped to fuel Germany's&quot;Economic Miracle.&quot; &quot;In the restaurant business, foreignersare indispensable,&quot; Mrs. Suessmuth said in an interview -- anod to the wonders foreign chefs have done for the porkymonotony of German fare.   But today the guest-workers and their children are largelyregarded as a problem by German society, and few of them havebecome German citizens. Writing in the weekly &quot;Die Zeit,&quot;author Rudolf von Thadden says: In France &quot;the son of anItalian immigrant, Jean-Louis Blanco . . . can becomeminister for social welfare. In Germany this would beunthinkable.&quot;   Many Germans would respond by noting that France is alsothe home of a xenophobic party stronger than anyanti-foreigner group in Germany, Jean-Marie Le Pen's NationalFront. The rise of xenophobic parties in other Europeancountries -- Belgium's Vlaams Blok and Austria's FreedomParty, to name two -- -is seen as further argument forrestrictions. This despite the fact that, as reported in TheWall Street Journal Europe, the portion of non-EC nationalswho live legally in the Community is only 2.4%.   &quot;We realize now that a European solution is necessary,&quot;says Mrs. Suessmuth. By this however most Germans don't meanthat Europe should open doors. Instead they envision auniform asylum law that would keep foreigners out. At thesummit in Maastricht in December, European Community membersagreed to work on uniform border and immigration controls.Members -- with the exception of Britain -- also plan asocial charter that would likely be friendly to organizedlabor's interest in protecting jobs. To be fair, such apolicy would be little different from the United States' ownshort-sighted border control. But in Europe, it could becomea bureaucratic version of the old Iron Curtain.   As for the Germans, they are understandably proud of theirreunification adventure. They call Eastern Germany their&quot;wild east.&quot; But micro-managing manpower is at odds with thefrontier spirit -- and often, uneconomic. Back at thePorschendorf dormitory, Mr. Smiljanic, the Yugoslav engineer,thinks aloud: &quot;In Singen, I worked, so I paid the city money.Now, the city pays me money, but I am stuck here. What is thepoint of that?&quot;   ---   Miss Shlaes is deputy features editor on the Journal'seditorial page.</TEXT></DOC>
