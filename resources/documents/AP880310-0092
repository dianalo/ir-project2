A South African official denied earlier reports that his countrywas involved in the coup attempt in Sao Tome and Principe, aMarxist-ruled island nation off the coast of Gabon.   STP-Press director Manuel Dende told reporters in the Angolancapital of Luanda one of two foreign mercenaries presumed to beAmerican was killed when the invaders attacked the central policestation in Sao Tome, the capital, early Tuesday. He said the otherwas captured by government troops.   Authorities in the two-island nation say two armed raiders werekilled, one wounded and 43 captured after they landed on beachesclose to Sao Tome in an abortive attempt to overthrow thegovernment of President Manuel Pinto da Costa. A policeman also waswounded.   Dende did not provide any further information on the suspectedAmerican mercenaries.   He told Angolan reporters the leader of the invading force,indentified as the head of a Sao Tome opposition group, was amongthose captured, along with mercenaries from several other Africancountries. He said the vessel used to drop the raiders in fishingboats also was seized.   He said the coup leader was Afonso dos Santos, head of a groupcalling itself the Liberators of Sao Tome and Principe. Angolantelevision, radio and newspaper reports quoted unidentifiedofficial sources as saying the invading force may have been landedclose to the islands by South Africans.   The South African Foreign Affairs Deparment's director for WestAfrica said that South Africa was ``absolutely and categoricallynot involved.''   Reports have appeared recently in West European newspapers aboutthe presence of South Africans in Equatorial Guinea, about 180miles north of the island of Sao Tome.   In Lisbon, Portugal, a Sao Tome government opponent said dosSantos was a former colonel in the Portuguese colonial army who ledan opposition movement based in Walvis Bay, a South African enclaveon the coast of South-West Africa.   Johannesburg's Sunday Star newspaper last May quoted ``a reportcirculating in Lisbon'' that up to 90 Sao Tome refugees who arrivedin Walvis Bay seeking political asylum a year before were beingtrained to launch an armed revolt against their government.   The South African government immediately denied the report andsaid it was trying to find a country which would accept therefugees. They reportedly have been held in custody for the pastyear as illegal immigrants.   The Citizen, a pro-government Johannesburg newspaper, quoted aRoman Catholic priest in Walvis Bay as saying 74 of the refugeeswere still in the enclave, 1,750 miles south of Sao Tome andPrincipe.   Dende quoted military authorities as saying the capture of mostof the invading party ``might not have been possible without thehelp of the people of the island.'' Earlier reports said fishermenalerted authorities about four armed men, believed to be onreconnaissance for the coup attempt, two weeks previously.   In recent months, Pinto da Costa has called on governmentopponents to return from exile. Wooed by U.S. and West Europeanaid, he has also unveiled plans to allow small private companies tooperate within the state-controlled economy.   The president also has announced plans to hold the first generalelections since the country gained independence from Portugal in1975. His Sao Tome and Principe Liberation Movement has ruled asthe country's only political party since then.</TEXT></DOC>
