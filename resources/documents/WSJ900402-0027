Corp. insurance companies for $530million.   After fees and closing costs, I.C.H. should receive about$495 million from the deal. The Louisville, Ky.-basedinsurance company said it will use about $345 million toreduce outstanding bank debt. Analysts said the deal willhelp improve I.C.H.'s financial situation. At the end of thethird quarter, the company had stockholders equity of $664million and liabilities of about $8.9 billion.</LP><TEXT>   Separately, I.C.H. reported a 1989 loss of $255.2 million,or $5.30 a share, compared with net income of $5.8 millionfor 1988. The loss included write-downs of about $262.5million from investments in First Executive Corp. stock andjunk bonds of Southmark Corp. and Integrated Resources Inc.   I.C.H. held about 20% of the common stock of FirstExecutive, a Los Angeles insurer that in turn had invested inhundreds of millions of dollars of junk bonds. The FirstExecutive, Southmark and Integrated Resources investmentsaccounted for somewhere between 10% and 15% of I.C.H.'sinvestment portfolio, according to Herbert Goodfriend,analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   &quot;The closing of this transaction is another step in theprocess of refocusing the growth plans of I.C.H.,&quot; saidI.C.H. Chairman Robert T. Shaw. Company officials weren'tavailable for further comment.   In the buy-out transaction, newly formed Life PartnersGroup Inc. will buy Philadelphia Life Insurance Co.,Massachusetts General Life Insurance Co., Wabash LifeInsurance Co. and three smaller companies from I.C.H. Thecompanies have total assets of $2.2 billion. The deal, whichwas financed with about 20% equity and 80% debt, involved nopublic debt and no junk bonds, said Thomas O. Hicks, chairmanof Hicks, Muse.   Investors in the new company are Hicks, Muse Equity Fund,with about 60% of the equity; Wand Investments, a jointventure between S.G. Warburg andamp; Co. and Bruce W. Schnitzer,with about 9%; GE Capital Corp. with about 15%; and seniormanagement and other institutional investors with theremaining equity. GE also provided the senior debt andmezzanine financing. After two years, GE could exercisewarrants that would give it a total equity position of about30%.   Along with the insurance operations, Life Partners willacquire some top managers of I.C.H., including formerpresident John Gardiner. &quot;These guys were the true operatingmanagement and if left unattended at I.C.H., they would havedone a more effective job at consolidating the operations&quot; ofthe various life insurance companies, said Mr. Goodfriend,the analyst. &quot;Under this management, they {Life Partners}have a good chance at making it work.&quot;   Mr. Hicks said that although he doesn't believe his dealsignals a new wave of publicly funded highly leveraged deals,the opportunity to do well-financed deals is increasing.&quot;Prices are in the process of adjusting to the new realities&quot;of the current financing market, he said. &quot;We think it's agood time to make acquisitions, if you can get goodfinancing.&quot;   The only other large leveraged buy-out in the past sixmonths was the March Forstmann Little andamp; Co. purchase of theGulfstream Aerospace unit of Chrysler Corp. for $825 million.   The leveraged buy-out of the I.C.H. companies waspossible, says Mr. Hicks, because the transaction wasn'toverpriced and didn't require public financing. &quot;We're buyingthese businesses for six times cash flow,&quot; said Mr. Hicks.&quot;The problem with the LBO industry has been that prices gotto the level of nine to 10 times cash flow and they wereoverleveraged.&quot;   Mr. Hicks said he avoided the leveraged buy-out businessthrough 1988 and 1989 because of the high prices. &quot;We chosenot to participate in that market,&quot; he said, other than tosell some of his investment portfolio into the high-pricedmarket.   Mr. Hicks said he and his partners in Hicks, Muse EquityFund will probably continue to add insurance companies totheir portfolio to take advantage of the consolidation in thelife insurance industry.</TEXT></DOC>
