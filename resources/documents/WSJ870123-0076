But the innovation, aimed only at the very wealthy, has aroused more controversy at home than enthusiasm abroad.    Encouraging foreigners to establish businesses in Canada as a prelude to citizenship is nothing new. But until recently, newcomers had to get actively involved in the day-to-day management of their affairs.    Then, last April, Ottawa began approving special investment funds designed to attract rich immigrants. The funds, which today number about 20, are all based in the economically depressed provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.    They work like this: Each candidate must have a proven track record in business and a personal net worth equivalent to at least $368,000 in U.S. money. They must invest at least $184,000 in an approved business or fund for at least three years.    A handful of people have been rejected on health or security grounds, but for most others an investment leads to an immigrant's visa in three to six months. Immigrants may apply for citizenship after living in Canada for three consecutive years.    Most funds charge annual management fees of 2% to 4%, plus as much as one-third of annual profits once the initial outlay is recovered. They all promise to return the money to the investor if the investor isn't granted a visa.    Critics describe the new policy as a passports-for-sale scheme. They consider it a radical departure from previous policy because it requires only cash from participants, making no explicit demands upon their time or business skills.    &quot;It distorts the social purpose of immigration,&quot; says Julius Grey, a Montreal immigration lawyer. Adds Howard Sinclair-Jones, executive director of the Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants, &quot;Canada is shortsighted in assuming only people with money make an economic contribution.&quot;    But proponents of the new funds say they serve a useful purpose. George Varnai, an immigration official in Vancouver, calls them &quot;a bold leap into an innovative way of dealing with immigration as an economic stimulus.&quot; And Andrew Hyslop, a partner with Calgary-based Merbanco Group, which manages several funds, predicts they'll make a &quot;big contribution&quot; to the country.    &quot;I'm very happy to stand up to charges that I'm part of the system that is 'selling passports,'&quot; he declares.    Gerry Weiner, Canada's immigration minister, denies the government is commercializing policy. Although the new investment device comes with no strings attached, he says, it's bound to attract an entrepreneurial elite who will help revitalize the Canadian economy.    &quot;Why shouldn't we be prepared to accept people with vision who want to create jobs in this country?&quot; Mr. Weiner asks.    Whatever the advantages of the program, it's unique in North America. The U.S. offers no such similar inducements; while it sets strict qualifications for immigration, none of them have anything to do with wealth.    Brooke Holmes, consul general with the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa, calls Canada's system &quot;interesting. . .because it combines immigration and foreign investment policy.&quot; Still, he doubts the U.S. would ever adopt such methods.    &quot;It would be hard to unite on something like that,&quot; Mr. Holmes said. &quot;(It) might be construed as a way of buying one's way into the U.S. and people who oppose it would use that argument.&quot;    In any case, very few outsiders so far have bitten Canada's new bait. Only 91 would-be immigrants had applied under the program by September, five months after the marketing of funds had begun, and about half of them were residents of Hong Kong.    (The most high-profile foreign investment in Canada recently was the purchase of a controlling interest in Husky Oil Ltd. by Hong Kong businessman Li Ka-shing for $400 million. But Mr. Li hasn't shown any interest in becoming a Canadian citizen, government officials say.)    Indeed, most of the enthusiasm for the innovation comes from capital-hungry Canadian entrepreneurs. They have deluged Merbanco with requests to tap its funds for &quot;way over&quot; $75 million, for example, Mr. Hyslop says, whereas the bank has managed to raise only $12 million from foreigners.    Some fund managers believe there's a basic conflict between what the government is looking for -- risk capital to create jobs -- and what the investor wants. &quot;He's only interested in protecting his capital,&quot; says Jeffrey McNair, vice president of Canada West Ventures Ltd., a fund managed by the Vancouver-based venture-capital concern Ventures West Group.    Typically, Mr. McNair says, non-Canadian investors want their money back in three to five years, while venture-capital projects often take 10 years or more to turn a profit.    Both provinces where the funds operate have set investment rules. Alberta insists the money be placed in small and medium-sized businesses. It won't allow investments in real estate or the stock market. Less-stringent British Columbia says 30% of a fund's capital may go into safe investments such as bank deposits, and allows funds to buy new issues of publicly traded concerns.    Jim Carrick, an Ontario official, says Canada's largest province won't allow similar funds because &quot;there isn't any real way to monitor where the money goes.&quot; Ontario only allows direct investments in certain government-approved projects and requires that Canadian investors put up 25% of the cash.    Still, the fledgling funds appear to be funneling money into economically sound projects. Merbanco says it has invested in a salmon fishery, a shopping mall, a mapping company and two manufacturing concerns.    Immigration officials say investors are protected from scam artists because each fund must be approved by both the federal government and a provincial government. James Humphries, first secretary for immigration, at the Canadian High Commission in Hong Kong, comments that &quot;the Hong Kong investor, in general, isn't someone you can put much over on. They've seen it all.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
