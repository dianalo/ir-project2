Also Sunday, underground Palestinian factions criticized anEgyptian peace proposal but remained as divided over whether toaccept the 10-point plan.   Meanwhile, an Israeli Cabinet minister suggested that Israelisdecide in a referendum on the Egyptian peace plan, which has deeplydivided the coalition government.   In a letter sent to Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and JusticeMinister Dan Meridor, the two legislators said 17 Palestinians aged12 or less were shot to death and 31 youths between the ages of 12and 16 were killed since April.   The letter said the 48 children represented one-third of allPalestinians killed over that period by soldiers.   On Sunday, troops shot and killed Bassam Farouk el-Jabri, 18,when they opened fire on stone-throwers in the Gaza Strip town ofKhan Yunis, hospital officials said. An army spokesman said themilitary was investigating.   The death raised to 574 the number of Palestinians killed bysoldiers or Israeli civilians during the 21-month uprising againstthe Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. FortyIsraelis also have been slain.   Also Sunday, soldiers shot and wounded 10 Palestinians instone-throwing clashes in the occupied lands, Arab hospitalofficials said.   The legislators, Yossi Sarid and Dedi Zucker, of the left-wingCitizens Rights Movement demanded that Rabin and Meridorinvestigate whether the killings are the result of new regulationson firing weapons.   In the last few weeks, Rabin liberalized the army's firingorders, giving troops permission to shoot unarmed masked youth ifnecessary to stop them. The youth are often members of undergroundforces who kill suspected collaborators or enforce strikes.   Also in Gaza, Palestinian assailants axed to death two men insouthern Rafah, one as an alleged drug dealer and the other as asuspected collaborator with Israel, Arab reporters said.   The army confirmed the deaths of Majid Mahmud El Nawaji, 30 andAdel Abu Shaluf, who Arab reporters said was 38.   The deaths raised to 119 the number of Palestinians killed byfellow Arabs in connection with the uprising. Most have been slainfor allegedly cooperating with Israel, but some were killed byMoslem fundamentalist groups as suspected drug dealers orprostitutes.   The pro-PLO Unified National Leadership of the Uprisingcriticized the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's plan in a leafletdistributed in the occupied territories, Israel Television andradio reported.   The leaflet did not reject the proposal, but it said the plancould not be accepted until it included provisions for directparticipation of the Palestine Liberation Organization in talks andthe establishment of an independent Palestinian state.   A separate leaflet signed by the Marxist Popular Front for theLiberation of Palestine rejected the plan and called Mubarak ``anagent of Washington and Tel Aviv.''   The Mubarak plan advocates trading land for peace and calls fora preparatory meeting between Israeli and Palestinian delegationsin Cairo as a prelude to negotiations.   Egyptian ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny told a meeting of Israelipeace activists in Tel Aviv on Sunday that the plan had PLO backing.   ``Egypt will not agree to anything the PLO refuses, so we alwayscoordinate with the PLO,'' Bassiouny said on Israel radio.   Interior Minister Arye Deri said Israel should hold a referendumto answer the question: ``Do we want peace or not?''   He told army radio such a vote would be a better idea than acollapse of the coalition government of the Likud bloc and LaborParty.   ``I think that people understand that war or conflict cannotpersist forever,'' he said.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc hasrejected the plan while the left-leaning Labor Party sees the planas a way of bridging Israeli and Palestinian positions.   Deri's ultra-Orthodox Shas Party has six representatives in the120-member parliament and helps hold the balance of power betweenthe left and right.</TEXT></DOC>
