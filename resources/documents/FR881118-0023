This policy provided for the issuance of SocialSecurity Acquiescence Rulings which explain the manner in which we willapply decisions of the United States Courts of Appeals that we determineconflict with SSA policy. As originally announced, these rulings were tobe applied only at the administrative law judge hearing level and by theAppeals Council. In January 1986, before we issued any Social SecurityAcquiescence Rulings, we revised this policy to provide that AcquiescenceRulings would apply at all levels of administrative adjudication (i.e.,initial, reconsideration, administrative law judge and Appeals Council)so long as they met certain criteria.We published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) at 52 FR 2557 on January23, 1987, describing the new type of ruling. The NPRM provided that AcquiescenceRulings would apply within the appropriate circuit at all administrativelevels of adjudication if:(1) (a) No prompt relitigation of the policy at issue was to be soughtin the relevant circuit; <T3>and</T3>(b) Application of the ruling at all administrative levels would be workable(i.e., would not result in administrative inefficiency) and feasible <T3>and</T3> would not have an unacceptably adverse effect on Social Securityprograms or disadvantage individuals already on the Social Security benefitsrolls; <T3>or</T3>(2) A regulatory change to conform national policy to a circuit court rulingwas being pursued and there was little doubt of its ultimate publication.The NPRM provided further that if a ruling did not meet one of these criteria,it would be applied only at the administrative law judge hearing leveland by the Appeals Council. However, if we determined that a particularcase would be suitable for relitigation, the Acquiescence Ruling wouldnot be binding on the Appeals Council. We received several comments onthat NPRM, which we considerd in developing the new proposed policy announcedin these proposed regulations.These proposed regulations withdraw the NPRM published at 52 FR 2557 onJanuary 23, 1987, introduce a new proposed policy for applying decisionsof the United States Courts of Appeals that we determine conflict withSSA policy, explain the manner in which we will apply those decisions,and as part of that policy, describe the limited conditions under whichwe may decide to relitigate the issue(s) decided by a circuit court ina particular case.SSA reserved the authority in the previous NPRM to limit the applicationof Social Security Acquiescence Rulings to the administrative law judgehearing level of and the Appeals Council because of concerns that adjudicatorsat the initial and reconsideration level would have difficulty in applyingsome circuit court decisions in a uniform manner. We also were concernedabout the potential impact of this new policy on SSA program administration.However, since this policy has been in effect, we have not used these criteriato limit the applicability of any ruling. We have concluded based on ourexperience with the acquiescence policy that making Social Security AcquiescenceRulings applicable at all levels of administrative adjudication will nothave a significant adverse impact on the agency or on the programs we administer.In reviewing circuit court decisions, we have found that the vast majorityof them consider only the issue of whether the Secretary's decision issupported by substantial evidence (the statutory standard for judicialreview of the Secretary's final decision). By definition, this type ofdecision requires no specific action by SSA except to effectuate the courtorder in question. Accordingly, most circuit court decisions do not conflictwith SSA policy; however, a few do conflict with SSA's interpretation ofa provision of the Social Security Act or the regulations. Our new policyprovides that as to this type of decision, unless we appeal, we will promptlypublish a Social Security Acquiescence Ruling. That ruling will apply atall levels of administrative adjudication within the applicable circuitso long as it is in effect, unless the decision, by its nature, appliesonly at certain levels of adjudication such as a case dealing with theconduct of an administrative law judge hearing.Some circuit court decisions do not conflict with SSA policy but neverthelessestablish an evidentiary or procedural requirement which the Secretarymust satisfy in his decisions; for example, requiring specific languagein an administrative law judge decision. These decisions may not warrantthat a Social Security Acquiescence Ruling be issued since they do notconflict with SSA's policys; however, SSA adjudicators will apply the requirementsof this type of decision in deciding claims of individuals residing withinthe applicable circuit. We may issue written instructions to our adjudicatorsregarding cases affected by such a decision.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Regulations</ITAG>The proposed regulations provide that we will apply United States Courtof Appeals decisions that we determine conflict with SSA policy unlessthe government appeals the decision. We generally will not issue an AcquiescenceRuling for a particular decision until the government has timely exhaustedall avenues of judicial review or has decided to refrain from pursuingfurther judicial review in the particular case.When the government does not appeal, or is unsuccessful on appeal, we willpublish a Social Security Acquiescence Ruling and we will apply the circuitcourt decision at all levels of administrative adjudication within theapplicable circuit to all claims presenting the issue(s) addressed in theruling unless the decision, by its nature, applies only to certain levelsof adjudication. The ruling will describe the case, identify the issue(s)considered, and explain how we will apply the decision within the applicablecircuit, including, as necessary, how the decision relates to other decisionswithin the applicable circuit. We will publish all rulings, including SocialSecurity Acquiescence Rulings as well as all other rulings, in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. In the past, Social Security Rulings and SocialSecurity Acquiescence Rulings have been published singly and in cumulativeannual editions, but have not appeared in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. All rulings will also be published for saleby the Government Printing Office and made available at district and branchoffices as well as the field offices of the Office of Hearings and Appeals.Generally, the rulings will be effective on the date of publication inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>.If we make a determination or decision on a claim after the date of a circuitcourt decision, but before we publish an Acquiescence Ruling, and afterthe publication of the ruling, the claimant requests application of theruling to the prior determination or decision and can demonstrate thatapplication of the ruling could change the prior determination or decision,we will readjudicate the claim at the same level it was last adjudicated,in accordance with the requirements of the ruling. The readjudication inthis circumstance will be limited to consideration of the issue(s) addressedby the ruling. Any new determination or decision on readjudication willbe subject to administrative and judicial review in accordance with ourregulations. Our conclusion that readjudication is not appropriate willnot be subject to further administrative or judicial review.Although we will apply a circuit court decision which conflicts with ourinterpretation of the Social Security Act on regulations, circumstancesmay arise which bring into question whether the circuit court would reachthe same conclusion as it did in its prior decision if the issue(s) wererelitigated within the circuit. Accordingly, the proposed regulations alsoestablish a process for the relitigation of issues whereby we may applyour interpretation of the Social Security Act or regulations in the futureadministrative adjudication of claims. The first step in this relitigation process requires the occurrence ofan activating event which raises the question of whether the circuit courtwould reach the same decision if the issue(s) previously decided were presentedto it again. In general, these activating events are: 1. An action by both Houses of Congress that indicates that a court caseon which an Acquiescence Ruling was based was decided inconsistently withcongressional intent, such as may be expressed in a joint resolution, anappropriations restriction, or enactment of legislation which affects aclosely analogous body of law; or 2. A statement in a majority opinion of the same circuit that indicatesthe court might no longer follow its previous decision if a particularissue were presented again; or 3. Subsequent circuit court precedent in other circuits that supports ourinterpretation of the Social Security Act or regulations on the issue(s)in question; or 4. A subsequent Supreme Court decision that presents a reasonable legalbasis for questioning a circuit court decision on which we based a SocialSecurity Acquiescence Ruling. The second step in the relitigation process requires that the General Counselof the Department of Health and Human Services, after consulting with theDepartment of Justice, concur that relitigation of an issue and applicationof our interpretation of the Social Security Act or regulations at theadministrative level within the circuit would be appropriate. The third step in the relitigation process requires publication of a noticein the <T4>Federal Register </T4>that we will apply our interpretation of theSocial Security Act or regulations as to the issue that was the subjectof the Acquiescence Ruling at the administrative level within the circuit.The notice will explain why we made this decision. We propose to continuethe policy of applying our interpretation of the Act or regulations inorder to relitigate an issue. This policy allows us to acquiesce in circuitcourt precedent while still preserving the option to relitigate. We view Acquiescence Rulings and related <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices as interpretative rules which would beexempt from the notice of proposed rulemaking provisions of the AdministrativeProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. section 553(b). If this view is made subject tolegal challenge, the Department will not apply the policy statement itissued in 1970 as regards the public's participation in rulemaking withrespect to the Ruling or notice at issue. This policy statement noted thatalthough the Administrative Procedure Act exempts from the notice of proposedrulemaking requirements matters relating to public property, loans, grants,benefits or contracts, the Department would waive this exemption and woulduse the notice of proposed rulemaking procedures in the exempt categories.See 36 FR 2532 (1971). After we have published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of our intent to relitigate an issue that isthe subject of an Acquiescence Ruling, we will take steps to expedite administrativeand judicial review and resolution of the issue in question and ensurethat we are able to comply with any subsequent circuit court or SupremeCourt decision. First, any claimant in the appropriate circuit whose claimis made subject to the relitigation procedure established in this regulationwill receive a separate notice with the determination or decision on theclaim. That notice will explain the difference(s) in policy between theAcquiescence Ruling and our interpretation of the Social Security Act orregulations and inform the claimant that the agency is seeking to relitigatethe issue in the circuit. Claims not subject to relitigation will continueto be decided in accordance with the circuit standard contained in theAcquiescence Ruling. Second, the agency will maintain a listing of allclaimants who receive such notices so that any subsequent decision of thecircuit court or the Supreme Court can be implemented quickly and efficiently.We will attempt to maintain national uniformity in the administration ofour programs by seeking Supreme Court review of adverse circuit court decisionswhich have a major impact on program administration, by clarifying ourregulations when their ambiguity has resulted in a circuit court decisioninterpreting them differently than the way we intended them to be interpreted,by issuing a new regulation(s) if a circuit court decision concerns anissue(s) which the current regulations do not address, and by seeking correctivelegislation from the Congress. Accordingly, we will rescind as obsoletea Social Security Acquiescence Ruling when: The Supreme Court overrulesor limits a circuit court decision on an issue that was the basis of anAcquiescence Ruling; or a circuit court overrules or limits its prior decisionon an issue that was the basis of an Acquiescence Ruling; or a Federallaw is enacted that removes the basis for the decision of a circuit courtthat was the subject of an Acquiescence Ruling; or we subsequently clarify,modify or revoke a regulation or ruling that was the subject of a circuitcourt decision that conflicts with our interpretation of the Social SecurityAct or regulations. We will also rescind as obsolete a Social SecurityAcquiescence Ruling when we subsequently issue a new regulation(s) addressingan issue(s) not previously included in our regulations when that issuewas the subject of a circuit court decision that conflicts with our interpretationof the Social Security Act or regulations and that decision is not onewhich is compelled by the statute or the Constitution. We are not proposing the acquiescence policy outlined in this NPRM becausewe believe that this policy, or any acquiescence policy, is legally compelled.Rather, we believe that the particular policy we are proposing is an appropriateexercise of our responsibility to administer the vast and complex SocialSecurity benefit programs in a manner that is least burdensome to SocialSecurity claimants and preserves our ability to attempt to maintain thenational uniformity of program administration. We solicit public commenton all aspects of our proposed acquiescence policy, particularly on themanner in which claims subject to relitigation should be selected. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures </ITAG>Executive Order 12291 The Secretary has determined that this is not a major rule under E.O. 12291because it will not have annual effect on the economy of 100 million dollarsor more, or otherwise meet the threshold criteria. Therefore, a regulatoryimpact analysis is not required. Paperwork Reduction Act These proposed regulations impose no new reporting or recordkeeping requirementsrequiring Office of Management and Budget clearance. Regulatory Flexibility Act These proposed regulations, if promulgated, will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities because theserules will only affect individuals. Therefore, a regulatory flexibilityanalysis as provided in Pub.
