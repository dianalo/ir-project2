Buddy Roemerdeclared a state of emergency in six parishes.   Four days of relentless rain pushed swollen Louisiana rivers,streams and bayous above flood stage and in some spots the watersweren't expected to crest for two days, meaning still more floodsfor the long Independence Day weekend.   Some parts of the state have received more than 20 inches of rainsince Allison came ashore in Texas on Monday afternoon, tossingthunderstorms and tornadoes across eastern Texas and all but thesoutheastern tip of Louisiana.   Originally expected to move north and dissipate, the low-pressuresystem that once was Allison moved back into Texas and was centerednear Houston raining on areas that were already soaked.   Flood watches remained in effect Friday in southeast and eastTexas and the National Weather Service extended a flash flood watchto include parts of northeast Texas, extending from the upper GulfCoast to as far north as Paris, Tyler and Nacogdoches.   At Winnfield, the north-central Louisiana city that receivedalmost two feet of rain in two days, the rain stopped Friday morningand water began receding. But 40 families remained in an evacuationcenter, waiting for water to leave their homes.   And Mayor Max Kelley worried that an earthen levee at a lakemight give way.   ``If that happens we're talking about another surge of water,''said Kelley. ``I don't know how high it would get.''   The National Weather Service kept revising flood warnings,pushing up expected river crests.   In southwest Louisiana, forecasters said the Calcasieu River waseight to 14 feet above flood stage in some areas and still rising.Low-lying roads and bridges were threatened and 60 houses at thetown of Oakdale were likely to flood this weekend, the weatherservice said.   At the town of Kinder, the Calcasieu was 14 feet above floodstage Friday morning and was expected to hit the 30-foot mark _ 18feet over flood stage _ by Sunday.   ``The U.S. Highway 190 bridge and the railroad bridge may becomeinundated above 29 feet,'' the weather service warned residents ofKinder. ``Numerous homes may need to be evacuated.''   The western and central parts of Louisiana took the worst of thestorm Thursday and Friday, but flood waters that plagued Baton Rougeearlier in the week didn't recede in some subdivisions where morerain was forecast.   ``It's gone down overnight about an inch, an inch and a half,''said Barbara Hatfield, as she surveyed the scene in the HighlandCreek subdivision.   ``It's still too high to get the cars out,'' she said.   Roemer on Thursday declared a state of emergency in six parishesand dispatched National Guard troops and equipment to help victims.   All but Pointe Coupee Parish were among the 36 Louisiana parisheswhich qualified for state and federal assistance just three weeksago when tornadoes hit the state.   Several hundred homes have flooded since Tuesday. Few damageestimates were available, but in Iberville Parish, near Baton Rouge,officials estimated damages at more than $1 million.   In Port Arthur, Texas, the weather service measured 3 inches ofrain from midnight to midday Friday, boosting the city's June totalto 17.5 inches, breaking the record of 15.04 inches set in June 1942.   Street flooding was reported in Port Arthur and nearby Beaumont,where more than five inches of rain fell Friday, and residents wereadvised not to travel unless absolutely necessary. Minor streetflooding also was reported in Houston.</TEXT></DOC>
