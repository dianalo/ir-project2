The 'substance valuation' is divided again into 'toxicity','groundwater currency' and 'concentration'. Each of these three partsis evaluated individually and results are normalized numbers betweenzero and hundred. The association of the three valuation numbers resultingfrom these procedures flows - as an integrated valuation number - combinedwith the also quantitied 'exposure assessment' into an integrated evaluationscheme from which, on a sound scientific base, activities may derive.Opposite to an assessment based on guide levels or maximum concentrationlimits, the suggested evaluation concept is capable of using actual andcontinuously enlarging and improving data sets of contaminants.</TEXT></DOC>
