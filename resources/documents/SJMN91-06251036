In the past, the Mercury News has tended to burysuch articles in an out-of-the-way portion of the paper, and reporters'contempt and condescension for their subject matter was often unedited.;   Iseem to be looking at a new and improved Mercury News, I'm happy to say! Thankyou for your excellent front-page coverage of the William Kiley story. Thebigotry inherent in this incident should be reprehensible to all of us. Yourprominent stories should serve as a reminder to many.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  The Letters Page  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GAYS, LESBIANS ARE GRATEFUL FOR UNBIASED STORIES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Letters Page  </MEMO><TEXT>     -- Jennifer March; Palo Alto; (hbox);      Your story on AB 101 (MercuryNews, Aug. 22) was to me one of the best coverages of gay and lesbian issues.We are always concerned about oppressed groups (blacks, Hispanics, SoutheastAsians, etc.), but the gay and lesbian community seems to be the mostinvisible and in many ways the most oppressed in recent times.;   Why arefundamentalist people displaying so much hate through their campaign againstAB 101 and using the Christian church as a weapon to condemn other people whoare different from themselves? Until humans learn to respect each other, weneed more educational stories that portray us as what we really are: simpleeveryday people.;   -- Isaac De la Rosa; San Jose  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910907  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  227  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, September 7, 199100251036,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
