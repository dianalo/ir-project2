More than 80percent of each type of object are optically interacting; about 60 percentare irregular in some way, and about 30 percent have tidal tails. Separationsrange from a few kpc to tens of kpc. About 30 percent of the objectshave elliptical galaxy characteristics and none has spiral. The meanoptical absolute magnitude of radio galaxies is fainter by 1 mag thanthe host galaxies of QSOs, and the distributions differ significantly.Radio galaxies are redder and larger and have smaller luminosity scalelengths than QSO hosts. Thus, they are a different sample of objects.In all objects, however, galaxy size is greatest at M(R) of about -22,and at the lower redshifts. 30 references.</TEXT></DOC>
