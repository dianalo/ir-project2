Traders and analysts said buying interest was focused largely on issues that perform well during economic downturns, suggesting that the market may be abandoning its earlier view that further increases in interest rates are needed to slow down the economy.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which stood nearly 15 points higher when it peaked at midday, closed with a gain of 1.07 at 2027.03 after briefly turning lower during the market's late sell-off.    Broader market averages also were left with only modest gains. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.26 to 261.03 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index climbed 0.17 to 147.81. Advancing issues led decliners on the Big Board, 740 to 644, with 587 issues unchanged.    Stocks held steady at slightly higher levels through most of the morning before their midday rally to session highs. Initially, the market succeeded in holding most of its gains, but prices gradually eroded as the afternoon progressed and the profit-taking accelerated that process.    Volume on the New York Stock Exchange dropped to 139.8 million shares from 169.5 million Wednesday because of a reduced level of dividend-related trading by institutions, along with a slowdown in other market activity.    Those participants who were active in the market concentrated their buying on traditional defensive stocks, including shares of food and drug companies, and issues that benefit from higher interest rates, such as insurance stocks, traders said.    Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, noted that stocks whose earnings tend to fluctuate along with the economy have been the market's weakest performers in recent weeks, while the interest-sensitive and defensive issues have held their ground and, in some cases, advanced.    &quot;That would be inconsistent with the consensus view that the economy is strong and will remain strong and will need much higher interest rates before it slows down,&quot; he said. &quot;The market might be telling us that, in fact, the risk is of economic weakness and some pressure on earnings.&quot;    At the same time, Mr. Clough said, the Federal Reserve is maintaining a fairly tight monetary policy and the recent increases in short-term interest rates, which he sees as more crucial for stock prices than long-term rates, aren't likely to be reversed soon.    Leo P. Grohowski, a portfolio manager at the Marinvest unit of Marine Midland Bank, said the rate situation presents the biggest obstacle to the market's attempts to advance. &quot;You're not going to make any significant move without some degree of stabilization in interest rates,&quot; he said.    While acknowledging that defensive and interest-sensitive issues appear to have the upper hand for now, Mr. Grohowski said the market's rapid rotation from one group to another so far this year indicates that they aren't likely to remain there for long. &quot;I don't expect to see any demonstrable leadership between now and the end of the year in any group,&quot; he said. . Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber added 1 3/4 to 58 1/4 following a report that Exxon may lead a consortium to acquire the company's All American Pipeline, up for sale since 1986. A Goodyear spokesman told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report the company plans to sell the pipeline for about $1.4 billion by mid-1989 at the latest. Several companies are interested in participating in the consortium, the spokesman said, but he said Goodyear may take the lead role itself and wouldn't confirm that Exxon may be a major partner. Exxon, which declined comment, dipped 1/4 to 45 7/8.    Hewlett-Packard, which fell 1 5/8 points Wednesday despite posting sharply higher fiscal third-quarter earnings, rebounded 3/4 to 45. Cray Research gained 1 5/8 to 78 7/8, but most other technology stocks retreated along with the market near the close.    Pennwalt added 2 1/4 to 84 1/4. The company, rumored as a possible takeover target, reached an agreement to sell its pharmaceutical business to Fisons of Britain for $460 million.    Kroger surged 2 1/2 to 35 amid a rumor that Odyssey Partners was about to disclose that it had acquired a stake of more than 5% in the supermarket company. An Odyssey source told the investor report the rumor was &quot;far-fetched.&quot; Kroger declined to comment.    Armtek gained 1 1/4 to 45 1/2. Mark IV Industries increased its tender offer for the company to $44 a share from $40 after Armtek's board rejected the original bid as inadequate.    Upjohn rose 5/8 to 32 3/8 on Big Board composite volume of 1.9 million shares. The company received final approval from the Food and Drug Administration for the marketing of minoxidil, its anti-baldness drug.    Grow Group, which said it is holding talks with &quot;a major American corporation&quot; about its possible acquisition, jumped 2 5/8 to 15 5/8. The company said the price to be offered hasn't yet been determined.    MAI Basic Four rose 1 1/2 to 19 3/4. The company said it is engaged in talks with parties interested in acquiring the 42% stake now held by chairman Bennett LeBow and William Weksel, a director, as well as with potential suitors for all of its shares.    Knight-Ridder fell 1/2 to 39 1/4 after a federal judge temporarily blocked implementation of a proposed joint operating agreement between the company's Detroit Free Press and the Detroit News. Gannett, owner of the News, gained 1/8 to 31 7/8.    The American Stock Exchange index rose 0.83 to 294.96. Volume was 8.9 million shares, up from Wednesday's 8.8 million.
