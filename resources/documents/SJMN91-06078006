Policesearched for her for 12 years and finally tracked her down in Canada.;    Whenasked why she had abandoned her family, she said she had run away from home toforce her three grown children to be more independent and quit leaning on her.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  INDEPENDENCE GROWS SLOWLY ON KIDS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The GrapevineBombeck, author of several books and occasional television personality, is asyndicated columnist.  </MEMO><TEXT>     I have been tempted to do that, but deep down inside, I have a naggingconcern they wouldn't look for me.;    The story brings up an age-oldquestion, &quot;How long do you mother?&quot; I have a feeling that when my kids marchdown the aisle to join in holy wedlock the persons with whom they are going toshare the rest of their lives, I will pass them a clean nose tissue, spit ontheir shoes, and shout, &quot;They need more work. Give me a minute. I'm notfinished yet.&quot;;    Parents have never figured out at what stage their childrenmust be before they are ready to assume control of their own lives. To someadults, it's like admitting defeat. We are committed to hang in there untilthey at least know the basics. They should know that towels belong on a rackand not on the floor.

As a matter of fact, the subject of money is one of the major reasonswhy most mothers run away from home.;    Maybe the Colorado mother hadchildren who retired before they ever had a job to retire from. Maybe theybought an $80 sweater for a girl they met in a line at the movies two weeksearlier and gave their mother a vegetable slicer for Mother's Day. Chances arethey considered summers as vacation time and borrowed money from her to see aPaul Simon concert.;    The mother eventually returned home. The story didn'telaborate about whether or not things got better during those 12 years. ButI'm willing to bet that when she walked in the door, one of her kids said,&quot;We're out of milk,&quot; another said, &quot;I'm out of underwear,&quot; and the thirdwhined, &quot;What did you bring me?&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ERMA BOMBECK column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910318  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  13B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  461  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday March 18, 199100078006,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
