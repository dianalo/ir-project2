In the year-earlier quarter, the company earned $40 million, or 50 cents a share. For the year, the food and agricultural products concern said it expects to report that earnings rose 4% to $154.7 million, or $1.94 a share, from $148.7 million, or $1.85 a share, a year earlier.    The company didn't project sales. It had $2.5 billion in sales for the year-earlier quarter and $9 billion in sales for fiscal 1987.    The company, which presented the outlook to securities analysts in Minneapolis, said that the projected results represent new highs and that it expects record per-share earnings again in fiscal 1989. Even accounting for the current drought the company said it will probably do at least as well in fiscal 1989 as it would in a normal crop year. ConAgra said earnings were up in fiscal 1988 despite the major downturn in the poultry industry.    For fiscal 1989, the company said its prepared foods segment expects another strong performance in consumer frozen foods, satisfactory fresh red meat results, a gain in seafood earnings, and a continued upward swing in the Armour processed meats business.    The company said its broiler chicken business is off to a good start this year and could be up substantially if industry supply stays in balance with demand. Its turkey business, still hurting from excessive industry supply, should improve by late fall and be up for the year.    ConAgra also said it expects higher earnings from its trading and processing, agriculture and flour milling segments. </TEXT></DOC>
