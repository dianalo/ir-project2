The Federal and NSW governments have now stepped inwith a 40 m Aus. dollar assistance package but further assistance willbe needed. The NSW State Rail Authority would be required to reduce freightrates and the unions prevented from further strike action in order thatno more mines would have to be closed. The Australian government hasrejected several export contracts for NSW steam coal because the pricewas too low. The current slump in the industry may last until 1990. Despitethe current instability, Australia is still the world's largest coalexporter, but enhanced marketing strategies are needed.</TEXT></DOC>
