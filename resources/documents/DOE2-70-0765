This was the first time advanced systems were utilizedduring successive plant outages to monitor inspection data. The hot-legelbow is made of statically cast stainless steel known for its mechanicalstrength and corrosion resistance. However, it presents unique difficultiesin ultrasonic inspection because the large grain sizes can cause severesignal attenuation and beam redirection. The 1987 examination was authorizedby Portland General Electric of Portland, Oregon, based on a study in1985 which revealed that the hot-leg elbow could have experienced maximumstrain and loading conditions because of steam generator snubber lockup.Seven indications were discovered during this examination; none of themwas larger than the expected grain size in this material. The data weredigitally processed at the EPRI NDE Center utilizing a personal computerbased system that was integrated to other commercial systems and capableof feature-based imaging. Bandpass filtering and spatial averaging werefound to increase signal-to-noise-ratio by as much as a factor of 2,i.e., 6 decibels. The hot-leg elbow was reexamined in 1988 using similarapparatus and inspection procedures. In addition to the seven 1987 indications,three more indications were discovered. These were determined to be inthe midwall region. The largest of all the indications as reported bythe inspection vendor was comparable to the average grain size, approximately0.50 inch. The data were digitally processed at the EPRI NDE Center usingsimilar techniques. Feature-based imaging of 1987 and 1988 inspectiondata made it possible to evaluate elbow conditions more reliably. 15refs., 52 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
