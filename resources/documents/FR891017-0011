Bryant, Chief, ComplianceAnalysis Division, Office of Munitions Control, Department of State (202-875-6650).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> This final rule makes some administrativechanges to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 CFRparts 120-130, which implement section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act(the Act), 22 U.S.C. 2778 and govern the export of defense articles anddefense services. It also makes certain technical corrections to the regulatoryamendments that were promulgated on April 4, 1988 (53 FR 11494). One important change is the extension of the validity of new export licensesfrom two to three years. This change does not affect existing licenses,but should eliminate unnecessary delays in the future by allowing exportersto renew licenses less frequently. This measure would also reduce the caseloadof the Office of Munitions Control (OMC) in a manner that is fully consistentwith U.S. security and foreign policy interests. As a result of this change,additional OMC resources can be devoted to increasing the level of scrutinyof certain license applications. The availability of additional resourcesshould also result in more efficient review of many license applications.Another change makes it clear that the Director of OMC has designated theDirector of the Diplomatic Security Service, or his designee, as authorizedto inspect and to copy records maintained by persons registered with OMC.Because of the increasing role being played by the Director of the DiplomaticSecurity Service in conducting pre-license and post-shipment verificationchecks, it is important that registrants be aware that designated personnelhave the authority to inspect and to copy records concerning the manufacture,acquisition and disposition of defense articles and the provision of defenseservices. A third change clarifies that the prohibition against permitting foreignpersons to apply for export licenses and most other approvals does notextend to approvals to resell or transfer defense articles. Under andSection;123.9, the approval of OMC is required before such articles can be resoldor retransferred to any country other than the country of end-use statedon the export license. A related change makes it clear that only U.S. personsmay sign applications for export licenses and other approvals (excludingthe retransfer approval discussed above). This requirement extends to thestatements regarding eligibility that must accompany each application,approval and notification. The remaining amendments are also technical or administrative in nature.These amendments deal with a foreign affairs function of the United Statesand are thus excluded from the major rule procedures of Executive Order12291 (46 FR 13193) and the procedures of 5 U.S.C. 553 and 554. The basicregulations that are amended by this final rule were the subject of publiccomment because of the desirability of obtaining public views. Becauseof the desire to increase the term of new export licenses from two to threeyears as soon as possible, and because the other changes are administrativeor technical in nature, these amendments are being published as a finalrule. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 22 CFR Parts 120, 122, 123 and 126 </ITAG>Arms and munitions, Exports.Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, title 22, chapterI, subchapter M, (consisting of parts 120 through 130) of the Code of FederalRegulations, is amended as set forth below: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 120_PURPOSE, BACKGROUND AND DEFINITIONS </ITAG>1.
