Walid Jumblatt called for Waite's release during an interviewbroadcast by Lebanon's state television on the first anniversary ofWaite's capture.   ``I do not think that Terry Waite is that big a spy. We shouldemerge from this whirlpool (of hostage taking),'' he said withoutelaborating.   Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party, the strongest Moslemmilitia in Lebanon's 12-year-old civil war, was guarding theAnglican Church emissary before he vanished Jan. 20, 1987.   The Druse militia leader has accused the Iranian-backedHezbollah, or Party of God, of holding Waite but the Shiitefundamentalist group has denied it. No group has claimedresponsibility.   Waite, 49, was on his fifth mission to Beirut to seek the releaseof foreign hostages. He was last spotted after leaving a hotel inMoslem west Beirut to meet with Shiite kidnappers.   He had told his Druse bodyguards he did not want them to escorthim to the clandestine meeting, whose site he did not disclose.   Fifteen Western foreigners are missing in Lebanon, including nineAmericans, most of them believed held by Shiites loyal to Iran.   Longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.</TEXT></DOC>
