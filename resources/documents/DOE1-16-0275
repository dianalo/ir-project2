<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-16-0275 </DOCNO><TEXT>The pion-nucleus interaction is investigated in the energy region 300--500MeV. The qualitative features of the interaction, including the isospindependence of the two-body amplitude and the increasing penetrabilityof the pion, are reviewed. The convergence of multiple scattering theoryin this energy range is discussed. The recent data for pion single-chargeexchange to the isobaric analogue state is compared to the theoreticalresults produced by a microscopic, momentum-space, isospin invariantoptical potential. The optical potential utilizes fully relativistickinematics and the fermi integration is performed exactly. A new modelfor the pion-nucleon D- and F-wave channels is necessary in order toextend this approach to the optical potential to higher energies. Thismodel, a 'doorway resonance' model, is reviewed. Plans for future workis outlined.</TEXT></DOC>
