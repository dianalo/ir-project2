The first of the series of amendments in this program addressedapplicability and icing certification standards and was published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>on January 31, 1983 (48 FR 4374). The secondof the series of amendments dealt with rotorcraft flight characteristicsand systems and equipment and was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on November 6, 1984 (49 FR 44422). The thirdin the series, Rotorcraft Regulatory Review Program, Amendment No. 5, updatedoperations and maintenance and was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on November 7, 1986 (51 FR 40692). The amendmentsin this fourth series involve the powerplant, rotor drive mechanism, andassociated support and protective systems for the powerplant and the rotordrive mechanism. These amendments are based on Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) No.84-19 published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on November 27, 1984 (49 FR 46670). All interestedpersons have been given an opportunity to participate in the making ofthese amendments and due consideration has been given to all matters presented.A number of nonsubstantive changes and minor changes of an editorial andclarifying nature have been made to the proposals based upon relevant commentsreceived and upon further review by the FAA. Except as indicated herein,the proposals contained in the notice have been adopted without change.One general comment is worthy of special note. An industry associationdeplores the fact that some 20 percent of the proposals in the notice werenot included in the agenda at the formal Rotorcraft Regulatory Review ProgramConference held December 10-14, 1979, in New Orleans, Louisiana. However,as indicated in the preamble to the NPRM, additional proposals which werepreviously the subject of various rotorcraft certification program specialconditions were included, as well as a number of proposals derived by theFAA from ongoing review and day-to-day application of the existing rules.The FAA's plans to amend the certification standards based on these activitieswere presented to the public at the earliest opportunity by way of theNPRM and every proposal adopted is within the scope of the notice. A total of seven comments were received. The commenters represented airframemanufacturers, engine manufacturers, rotorcraft owners, and operators.The majority of the commenters agreed with the substance of the NPRM. Severalrecommended minor changes. These recommendations and their resolutionsare contained in the discussion of comments. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments </ITAG>The following are keyed to like-numbered proposals in Notice No. 84-19and are presented in the same order as the corresponding amendments foundin the rules portion of this document. <T3>Proposal 3-1. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 1.1 of theFederal Aviation Regulations (FAR) to add a new definition for ``ratedcontinuous OEI power'' and to revise the definition of existing ``rated30-minute power'' and ``rated 2\1/2\-minute power.'' This amendment isneeded as a part of a program to introduce a new rotorcraft and engineone-engine-inoperative (OEI) rating and to clarify the limitations on theuse of the existing 30-minute and 2\1/2\-minute power ratings. Two commenterssubmitted identical objections to the addition of the term ``OEI'' in thedefinition of the 30-minute rating. They contend that this change wouldprevent designers, constructors, and operators of single-engine rotorcraftfrom taking advantage of this rating to provide extra power during abnormalor emergency operating conditions, and that such denial will reduce theutility and safety of these rotorcraft.A review of the history and an examination of the qualification programsand the performance credit allowed for this 30-minute rating in both Parts27 and 29 of the FAR clearly indicate that this rating is intended onlyas a rating to be used after failure of an engine in a multiengine turbine-poweredrotorcraft. Hence, the term OEI is applicable, both from a definitive standpointand for standardization of nomenclature that becomes apparent in subsequentdefinitions and usages in the regulations affected by this rule change.Two commenters also question the need to add the term ``OEI'' to the ``rated2\1/2\-minute (OEI) power'' definition of ``rated 2\1/2\-minute power''since the limitations on the use of this rating are already clear in thecurrent definition. The FAA concludes, as indicated above, that standardizationof nomenclature will be achieved by this change and that it may precludemisinterpretation associated with an ongoing and expansive use of the FARby the foreign rotorcraft community. Therefore, the proposal is adoptedwithout change. <T3>Proposal 3-2. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 1.2 to include,as a new abbreviation, the term ``OEI'' meaning ``one engine inoperative.''This abbreviation has found widespread acceptance in the aviation community.No comments were received, and the proposal is adopted without change.<T3>Proposal 3-3. </T3>The notice proposed to amend paragraph (b) of andSection;27.67 to permit rotorcraft climb performance to be determined at ``continuousOEI'' power for rotorcraft certificated for this power. In addition, theterm ``30-minute power'' would be revised to read ``30-minute OEI power.''These changes are needed to coordinate and implement the use of the new``continuous one-engine-inoperative (OEI) rating'' for rotorcraft and toimplement the revision to the definition of ``30-minute power'' includedin Proposal 3-1. This proposal is one of a series of revisions to Parts1, 27, 29, and 33 which are directed at creating a new continuous OEI rotorcraftpower rating. This rating would be available as an alternate to the existing30-minute OEI rating presumably at a lower power, but without a time limitation.This rating would enable rotorcraft dispatched on routes requiring en routestay-up ability for more than 30 minutes after an engine failure to carrya higher useful load and thus improve productivity. Rotorcraft operatorsservicing distant offshore petroleum industry facilities would particularlybenefit by the availability of this rating. No comments were received,and the proposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-4. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.361 torequire design consideration of the engine torque loads associated withemergency operation of governor-controlled turboshaft engines and alsotorque reaction loads from sudden engine stoppage that may be expectedwith turbine engines. This amendment requires design features to ensurethat the engine will remain in place and not jeopardize the continued safeoperation of the rotorcraft in the event of these conditions. One commenter objects to the proposal and contends that the term ``suddenengine stoppage'' is vague and could be interpreted to mean instant stoppagewith the concurrent assumption of infinite loads and is, therefore, unrealistic.However, FAA experience with the application of similar wording regardingengine mount limit loads in corresponding subparts of Parts 23 and 25 indicatesthat the engine manufacturers can reasonably provide data on inertia ofrotating parts and deceleration times to be expected in the event of suddenengine stoppage which generates critical loads. These data should be acceptablefor design analysis in this amendment and should avoid the need to considerany concepts regarding infinite and unrealistic loads. This same commenter objects to the last phrase in proposed paragraph (a)(5)which would have required engine torque limit load values for governor-controlledengines to include the ``torque imposed by inadvertent or abnormal controlmotions to be expected in service.'' The objection is that this requirementwould be unrealistic as well as impractical to apply. Upon reconsideration,the FAA agrees the proposed language could create undue burdens becauseof difficulty of interpretation or application and, accordingly, proposedparagraph (a)(5) is removed. A similar change to Proposal 3-40 for andSection;29.361 has been made. This proposal is adopted with these changes. <T3>Proposal 3-5. </T3>The notice proposed to amend Part 27 to add a newandSection; 27.833 which is a revised version of the lead-in paragraph ofexisting andSection; 27.859(c) as it relates to the approval requirementsfor fuel heaters. This new section is needed to facilitate the extensivechanges adopted for andSection; 27.859 in Proposal 3-6 and to achieve parallelrule construction with Part 29. This revision will ensure that all combustionheaters, not just those gasoline-operated, will be approved. No commentswere received, and the proposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-6. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.859 extensivelyby revising the existing combustion heater design and qualification standardsto make them equivalent to those now prescribed in Part 29. This amendmentwill minimize the probability of hazardous fires from malfunction or failureof combustion heaters. No comments were received, and the proposal is adoptedwithout change. <T3>Proposal 3-7. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.901(b)(1)to require satisfactory determination that the affected rotorcraft canoperate safely throughout adverse environmental conditions, such as highaltitude and temperature extremes. This amendment is needed to provideconsistent application of environmental qualification aspects. The noticealso proposed to add a new paragraph (b)(5) to require design precautionsto minimize the potential for incorrect assembly of components and equipmentessential to safe operation. Without such precautions, errors in the assemblyand maintenance of the complex systems and equipment found in modern rotorcraftcan introduce hazards. No comments were received, and the proposal is adoptedwithout change. <T3>Proposal 3-8. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.903 toinclude a requirement that reciprocating engines must be qualified underandSection; 33.49(d) to be eligible for approval in helicopters. Also, changeswere included which prescribe tests and qualifications for powerplant areacooling fans. This will serve to ensure that correct qualification proceduresare used for helicopter engines and that all powerplant cooling fans areproperly tested. No comments were received, and the proposal is adoptedwithout change. <T3>Proposal 3-9. </T3>Currently andSection; 27.923(e), as it relates tothe 2\1/2\-minute power rating, and andSection; 27.923(j), as it relatesto the 30-minute power rating, provide for only minimal testing of thecapability of the rotor drive system to sustain these powers. The noticeproposed to amend these paragraphs to extend the testing to adequatelyassure valid qualification tests. These changes ensure the integrity ofthe rotor drive system so that it will safely sustain the higher stressesexpected with actual, repeated use of these power ratings. New paragraph (k) provides a qualification test schedule for the optional,continuous OEI rating introduced in the notice by proposed amendments toandSection;andSection; 1.1, 1.2, and 27.67, and by similar proposed amendmentsto Parts 29 and 33. This new paragraph is needed to provide a basis forendurance testing qualification for this new rating. The notice proposed to remove, where applicable, the reference to ``enginepower'' to avoid confusion regarding whether the tests prescribed by thissection must be conducted at powers corresponding to engine ratings establishedunder Part 33 rather than rotorcraft powers which may be lower than thoseestablished under Part 33 but selected by the applicant as a limit on itsproduct. Also, the notice proposed to add the abbreviation ``OEI,'' whereapplicable, to coordinate the introduction of this term as defined in anamendment to Part 1. No comments were received, and the proposal is adopted without change.<T3>Proposal 3-10. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.927 toadd a requirement that the rotor drive system overtorque tests prescribedby paragraph (b) be conducted at the maximum rotational speed intendedfor the power condition of the test. The existing rule, which specifiesonly the torque to be applied to the rotor drive system during the overtorquetest, does not otherwise completely define the applicable test requirements.One commenter objects to the proposal, claiming that to specify the rotationalspeed as ``maximum'' would preclude the concept of reducing speed duringthe test to facilitate achieving required test torque. However, existingparagraph (b)(3) already provides relief from exacting test conditionsif there is adequate substantiation. This proposal is, therefore, adoptedwithout change. It is noted that this section, as revised, is not totallyparallel with Part 29 but that inconsistency must be considered separatelyfrom this rulemaking action as it is beyond the scope of the notice. <T3>Proposal 3-11. </T3>The notice proposed to add a new andSection; 27.954that sets forth requirements for design features to prevent ignition offuel vapor in the fuel system due to lightning strike to the rotorcraft.Lightning strike and any subsequent strokes which might cause streamering,corona, and arcing associated with a lightning strike can result in catastrophicexplosions in the rotorcraft's fuel system. No comments were received,and the proposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-12. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.955 toreorganize and restate the rotorcraft fuel system flow performance requirementsand to add new requirements for test conditions to ensure that adequatefuel flow is available to the engine in critical combinations of adverseconditions which may be expected during operation of the rotorcraft. Additionally,the amendment requires a correlation between fuel filter blockage and thefuel filter warning device required by existing andSection; 27.1305(q), andprovides design and performance standards for auxiliary fuel tank and transfertank fuel systems. These changes were proposed to ensure that all parametersassociated with fuel supply to the engine are adequately addressed. One commenter suggests that the fuel flow considerations in proposed paragraphs(a)(1) through (a)(7) require an excessive number of tests. Also, the commenterobjects to the concept that all of the test conditions should be assumedto occur or exist simultaneously. Aside from new requirements in this proposal pertaining to fuel filterblockage, the use of critical fuel properties, and critical pump and pumpmotive power or speed, the statement of flow requirement is not technicallychanged. The new requirements should be relatively easy to adopt into acarefully planned flow test. However, the FAA agrees that it may be unreasonableto expect all conditions which can adversely affect fuel flow to existsimultaneously, and a phrase allowing the exclusion of improbable combinationsof conditions has been added in the final rule. This same commenter offers without further comment alternate wording forthe proposed revisions. Included in this was the suggestion that the fuelpressure (during the fuel flow test) may be allowed to fall below the minimumlimit specified by the engine type certificate data sheet during transientsfor which only safe operation must be shown in flight. The FAA considersthat this change would be confusing to the crew (e.g., fuel pressure belowthe red radial on the fuel pressure gauge) and may even compromise thesafety margin established during the engine certification test program.This suggested change is inappropriate and is not included in the amendment.Another suggested change to the proposal would, in effect, remove any requirementto have fuel flow capability to continue normal engine operation with fuelfilter blockage in excess of the degree of filter blockage associated withactivation of the indicator required by andSection; 27.1305(q). After consideringthe success of fuel system performance based on previously approved fuelflow testing methods, the FAA concurs that the proposed requirement maybe excessive, and accordingly, the section is revised to only require anadequate flow with filter blockage associated with activation of the warningindicator required by the associated provisions of andSection; 27.1305(g).Another commenter states that the automatic fuel transfer provisions ofnew paragraph (b) and revised paragraph (c) are not justified by serviceexperience and will introduce unnecessary complexity in the fuel system.An FAA review of presently certificated rotorcraft fuel systems indicatesthat most already employ the features of these proposals. Rotorcraft designsand operations often impose a high workload on the flightcrew; therefore,reasonable steps to alleviate this increasingly burdensome trend are notonly appropriate but necessary. The proposal is adopted with the change noted. <T3>Proposal 3-13. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.961 torestate the fuel system hot weather qualification requirements and to adda requirement for the system to be capable of providing adequate fuel duringoverpower transients to be expected. This amendment makes needed improvementsto the existing wording of andSection; 27.961 to assure adequate qualificationtesting. No comments were received, and the proposal is adopted withoutchange. <T3>Proposal 3-14. </T3>A new paragraph (b) to andSection; 27.963 would havespecified higher load factors in the design and retention of fuel tanksto provide better assurance that the tanks would retain their contentsas a means of minimizing postcrash fuel fire hazards. A commenter objectsto the higher load factors, stating that these factors will actually degradefuel system crashworthiness in many cases. The commenter offers an alternateproposal for improved fuel system crash resistance which includes a fueltank drop test, allowances for relative motion between fuel system components,and a requirement for fuel cells (presumably, bladder cells) to meet thepuncture, tear rate, impact penetration, panel, and fitting strength ofan unspecified technical standard order. The drop test suggested by the commenter was previously presented as anFAA proposal at the Rotorcraft Regulatory Review Conference held at NewOrleans, and received favorable comments. However, the proposal was notincluded in the notice because associated benefit/cost studies failed toshow a positive beneficial result. Nevertheless, the FAA is interestedin continuing efforts to develop regulatory criteria for rational fuelsystem crashworthy designs for rotorcraft. The FAA is active in relatedprograms in progress at its Technical Center and is also participatingin the proceedings of the General Aviation Safety Panel (GASP) as wellas studying the progress in this regard of foreign manufacturers. As aresult of all of these activities, the FAA expects to develop, in the nearfuture, an NPRM specifically for rotorcraft fuel system crash resistancethat would be directly related to the survivability of the occupants. Asa result and after further consideration, the portion of the proposal toadd a new paragraph (b) is withdrawn, and existing paragraphs (a) through(d) of this section will remain unchanged. The notice also proposed to add new paragraphs (f) and (g). These additions,now redesignated as paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, require designsand tests to ensure that no exposed surface inside a fuel tank would, undernormal or malfunction conditions, constitute an ignition source. They alsoset forth standards for the design and qualification of fuel tanks locatedin personnel compartments. These additions are needed to ensure freedomfrom the hazards of fuel tank internal explosions and to ensure that fueltanks in passenger compartments are installed to present no hazards tothe personnel or to the rotorcraft. No comments were received regardingthis portion of the proposal. The proposal is adopted with the changes discussed.<T3>Proposal 3-15. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.969 sothat properly interconnected fuel tanks will not be required to have anexpansion space for each tank if adequate expansion space is otherwiseprovided. This amendment will eliminate unnecessary design requirementswhen simpler designs have been proven satisfactory. No comments were received,and the proposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-16. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.971 toprescribe finite, minimum values for fuel tank sump capacity, to authorizethe use of a sediment bowl in lieu of a sump, and to require these sumpsor sediment bowls to be effective in any ground attitude which can reasonablybe expected in service. A commenter objects to the fuel tank sump volume requirements on the basisthat lower sump volumes acceptable under andSection; 29.971 for transportcategory rotorcraft have been shown by service experience to be adequatefor Part 27 rotorcraft. Also, the commenter questions the need for a largercapacity sump bowl than is required for Part 29 rotorcraft. The sump volumeselected for the proposed rule is identical to that required for normalcategory airplanes (Part 23) and, as noted by the commenter, is largerthan that required for transport category rotorcraft. In the FAA's view,this difference is warranted when it is considered that general aviationfuel supplies are likely to have more water and other contaminants thanmay be expected for fuel supplies for transport aircraft. However, theFAA concurs that the 2-ounce-for-every-20-gallons-sediment-bowl requirementof proposed andSection; 27.971(a)(1) is not justified, and after reconsideringit has been changed to 1 ounce for every 20 gallons. The proposal is adoptedwith this change. <T3>Proposal 3-17. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.975 toadd a new paragraph (b) which requires fuel tank vent systems to be designedto minimize spillage in the event of rollover of the rotorcraft duringlanding or ground operation. This is intended to reduce the potential forfuel fires when fuel escapes from a vent port after a rollover and encountersan ignition source. No comments were received, and the proposal is adoptedwithout change. <T3>Proposal 3-18. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.991 torestate the existing fuel pump redundancy requirements, to remove unnecessarydefinitions and detail design requirements, and to extend the requirementfor consideration of pump failure to include the fuel pump motivation device(such as a generator for electric pumps). These changes clarify the pumprequirements and ensure that the intent of the rule is met; i.e., thatfuel flow is adequate regardless of whether the failed component is a pumpor the pump's motivating device. No comments were received, and the proposalis adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-19. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.993 torequire fuel lines to be constructed and routed to withstand the same newhigher load factors as discussed in Proposal 3-14 for andSection; 27.963.A commenter objects to this new requirement citing the same reasons expressedfor paragraph (b) of Proposal 3-14. For the reasons expressed in the discussionof Proposal 3-14, this proposal is withdrawn. <T3>Proposal 3-20. </T3>The notice proposed to amend the introductory paragraphof andSection; 27.997 to include a requirement that the fuel filter mustbe located in the fuel system to protect any component sensitive or susceptibleto fuel contamination, including fuel metering devices or pumps. The intentof the proposed amendment has been clarified by inserting the words ``butnot limited to'' in the third line of andSection; 27.997. This will ensurethat any component sensitive to fuel contamination, not just fuel meteringdevices or an engine positive displacement pump, is protected. A commenter objects to including fuel metering devices in the requirement,stating that fuel meter malfunction due to contaminants will have no effecton fuel flow. It is believed that the commenter is referring to fuel flowrate measuring devices whereas the proposal involves the fuel meteringdevices intended to control flow rate such as fuel injection devices. Theselatter items require filter protection from fuel contaminants. The amendment to paragraph (d) will clarify and limit the scope of theexisting rule to only provide for adequate filtration since the capacityaspect of the rule is addressed elsewhere by revisions to andSection;andSection;27.955 and 27.1305. Accordingly, this proposal is adopted without substantive change. <T3>Proposal 3-21. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.999 torequire fuel system drains to be effective with the rotorcraft in any groundattitude position. This change would ensure effective fuel drainage whenthe rotorcraft is parked on uneven terrain. In addition, the notice proposedto amend paragraph (b)(2) to require fuel drains to have means to ensurepositive closure, as contrasted to positive locking, in the ``off'' position.This will accommodate designs that feature spring-loaded drain closureswhich have been found to be satisfactory. No comments were received, andthe proposal is adopted without substantive change. <T3>Proposal 3-22. </T3>The notice proposed to amend the title of andSection;27.1011 from ``General'' to ``Engines: General'' to reflect the conceptthat it applies specifically to engine oil systems and not to other systemssuch as those for transmissions and rotor drive system components. A newandSection; 27.1027 provides standards for oil systems for transmissionsand rotor drive systems. No comments were received, and the proposal isadopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-23. </T3>The notice proposed to relax what has been foundto be an unduly restrictive requirement in current andSection; 27.1019(a)(3)for an ``indicator'' to indicate the contamination level of oil filters.The amendment instead allows accepting a ``means to indicate'' the contaminatelevel to allow a wider range of acceptable methods of compliance. No commentswere received, and the proposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-24. </T3>New andSection; 27.1027, introduced in the notice,provides oil system standards for transmissions and other drive systemcomponents. This amendment complements an amendment to andSection; 27.1011which limits its scope to engine oil systems. (See Proposal 3-22.) A commentercorrectly notes that the reference to paragraph (a)(1) in paragraph (c)should be to paragraph (b). This correction and other minor editorial changeshave been made to paragraph (c).Another commenter suggests that the function of the screen required byparagraph (c) is only to protect the oil pump associated with pressurizedlubrication systems. While that function is important, this screen shouldalso serve to prevent any debris, regardless of its source, which couldobstruct oil flow from the oil tank or sump, from entering the parts ofthe system not protected by the screen required by paragraph (b). Paragraph(c), revised as discussed, will accomplish this purpose. After the consideration of comments received on the oil system proposalfor transport rotorcraft (Proposal 3-62), it is apparent that compliancewith andSection; 27.1011, which after this amendment pertains only to engineoil systems, should not be required for transmissions and other rotor drivesystem components. Accordingly, new andSection; 27.1027 is revised to removereference to andSection; 27.1011. The proposal is adopted with the changesdiscussed. <T3>Proposal 3-25. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.1041to provide clarification and definition of powerplant components requiredto be considered when evaluating the performance of the powerplant coolingsystems and arrangements. This amendment will minimize needless interpretationor extrapolation of the existing rule. A commenter suggests that the general powerplant cooling system requirementsof andSection; 27.1041 or other appropriate rules should be revised to requirethe cooling arrangements for rotorcraft gearboxes to be capable of coolingthe gearboxes at abnormally high ``emergency'' temperatures commensuratewith continued cruise flight after a failure in the normal cooling system.The commenter claims that such arrangement could eliminate unnecessaryand perhaps hazardous, unscheduled landings when the rotorcraft gearboxcooling system actually had the capability, although unknown to the crew,to continue flight. While there is some merit to this, there is adequateinformation on continued operation in failure modes found in the EmergencyProcedures Section of the applicable Rotorcraft Flight Manual. Furthermore,rulemaking on this subject is beyond the scope of the notice. The proposalis adopted without substantive change. <T3>Proposal 3-26. </T3>The notice proposed to add to the powerplant coolingtests required by andSection; 27.1045 an alternate acceptance criterion whichmay be appropriate if, during the cooling test, component temperaturespeak and then decline rather than stabilize. In these instances, the currentrequirement to continue the test until ``stabilization'' occurs is undulyrestrictive and should be eliminated. No comments were received, and thisproposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-27. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.1091to remove paragraph (d) since the specific test defined by this paragraphmay be meaningless or at least not critical for certain rotorcraft. Further,the turbine inlet foreign-object-ingestion protection provided by paragraph(d) is adequately evaluated by existing andSection; 27.1091(e)(2). No commentswere received, and the proposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-28. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.1093to relocate the phrase ``within the limitations of the rotorcraft'' fromparagraph (b)(1) to paragraph (b)(1)(ii). This change will restore thisphrase to its original and proper context; i.e., as pertinent to the requirementsfor demonstrating flight into snow. The existing location of the phrasemay be read to imply that limitations may be established for the rotorcraftin lieu of demonstrating capability of the engine inlet to operate in icingmeteorological conditions. This was not intended or justified by the editorialmisplacement to this section made by Amendments 27-9 (39 FR 35461; October1, 1974) and 27-12 (42 FR 15044; March 17, 1977). A commenter objects to the proposal stating that the change would requirethe engine air inlet system to operate in a severe, possibly continuous,icing environment although the rotorcraft to be certificated may be otherwisecompletely unprotected and incapable of operation in icing conditions.Engine inlet ice protection is required whether or not the remainder ofthe rotorcraft is protected. This is the reason that engine power assuranceduring even an inadvertent icing encounter is of critical importance tocontinued safe flight. Thus, there is an independent requirement for engineair inlet operation in icing conditions regardless of the icing capabilityof the remainder of the rotorcraft. Another commenter states that the requirements of andSection; 27.1093(b)(2)for ground operation (taxiing) in certain meteorological conditions shouldbe limited in applicability to rotorcraft which are qualified for flightinto atmospheric icing (ref. andSection; 27.1419). A proposal for such arule change of this order is beyond the scope of the notice and is, therefore,inappropriate in this rulemaking action. The proposal included changing the reference in paragraph (b) from AppendixC of Part 25 to Appendix C of Part 29. These appendices are identical.This change is required to correlate the airframe icing requirements inandSection; 27.1419 to the powerplant icing requirements of this section.Accordingly, the proposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-29. </T3>The notice proposed to amend paragraph (c) of andSection;27.1141 to extend its applicability to any powerplant valve regardlessof the location of the valve control, except that valves are excluded iftheir function is not required for safety. No comments were received, andthis proposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-30. </T3>The notice proposed to amend paragraphs (a) through(d) of andSection; 27.1143 to replace the terms ``throttle control'' and``thrust control,'' which are appropriate only to certain engines, withthe more general term ``power control.'' This change should preclude misconceptionsregarding engine control arrangements when governor-controlled turboshaftengines are employed in rotorcraft. No comments were received, and thisproposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-31. </T3>The notice proposed to amend paragraph (b) of andSection;27.1163 to restate the design requirement for accessory drive torque limitingdevices in terms which will now allow the torque limiting device to beincluded in either the accessory or the rotor drive system. This will eliminatethe ambiguity in the present rule which implies that the torque limitingdevice required for accessories must be in the design of the rotor drivesystem. No comments were received, and the proposal is adopted withoutchange. <T3>Proposal 3-32. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.1189to require flammable fluid shutoff devices and controls for these devicesto be designed, located, and protected to function properly under conditionslikely to result from a critical fire in a powerplant area. This changeeliminates design arrangements wherein valves located outside the firezone but in close contact to the firewall may be adversely affected byheat transfer through the firewall during a substantial powerplant fireand may interfere with the operation of these shutoff devices, thus, addingto the hazards of an engine fire. No comments were received, and this proposalis adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-33. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.1193by adding a new paragraph (f) to require redundant retention means foreach openable or readily removable panel, cowling, or engine or rotor drivesystem covering. Conventional fasteners for these devices are subject tofrequent operation by maintenance personnel and are known to deteriorateor fail from wear or vibration. Such failure could be hazardous if it resultsin a loose panel, cowling, or covering striking or being struck by therotors or by critical controls. One commenter requests that proposed andSection; 27.1193(f) be revised toreflect the single failure concept when evaluating the need for redundantcowling or panel retention devices. Such a limitation to the rule wouldbe inappropriate since one failure can contribute directly to loads carriedby other retention devices and thus result in multiple failures. The amendmentprovides relief from multiple failure considerations if such failure modesare extremely improbable. Therefore, the proposal is adopted without change.<T3>Proposal 3-34. </T3>Paragraph (1) of andSection; 27.1305 is revised torequire a low fuel warning device for each tank that can be used to feedan engine, including single tank configurations. In addition, new wordingis added to allow, if desired, a longer time between warning actuationand fuel exhaustion and to require the low fuel warning device to be independentof the normal fuel quantity indicating system. This change will clarifywhich tanks (i.e., any tank which directly feeds an engine) require lowfuel warning devices and allow the designer flexibility to set the deviceto signal low fuel earlier than 5 minutes before fuel exhaustion if neededfor operational reasons. A requirement for the low fuel warning deviceto be independent of the normal fuel quantity indicator is needed sincewithout independence, errors or malfunctions of the normal indicators couldmask the signal to the low fuel warning device and negate its value. Paragraph (m) currently requires ``a means to indicate to the pilot wheneach emergency pump is in operation.'' The existing rule was intended toalert crew members to the fact that the primary pump has failed so thatappropriate precautions for continued flight in this failure mode may beinstituted. Some rotorcraft configurations operate the main pump and theemergency pump simultaneously. Others rely on suction fuel feed systemsafter failure of the main pump, thus leading to possible confusion regardingacceptable means of compliance. This proposal revises paragraph (m) tosimply state that an indication of pump failure is required. Other rulesrequire continued fuel feed in the event of this type of failure. One commenter suggests that the proposed change to paragraph (m) shouldinclude, as a means of compliance, a preflight check to enable the crewto establish that all fuel pumps are functioning properly. The FAA doesnot concur because a preflight check would not provide the flightcrew withthe in-flight failure indication needed to enable the crew to instituteany appropriate precautions associated with continued operation on theremaining derogated fuel system. The notice proposed to amend paragraph (q) to extend its application toall rotorcraft (not just those with turbine engines) and to require anindication to the crew of the degree of filter blockage established inconjunction with the fuel flow demonstrated in compliance with andSection;27.955. This change clarifies the intentions of the rule and correlatesthe setting of the indicator to the fuel system performance. Paragraph (s), which currently requires an indicator to indicate the functioningof all fuel heaters, is revised to require function indicators only forselectable or controllable fuel heaters. Thermostatically modulated fuelheaters do not need crew attention and a requirement for an indicator forthe function of heaters of this type is removed. No other comments were received. For the foregoing reasons, this proposalis adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-35. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.1337to add a new paragraph (e) to require rotor drive system transmissionsand gearboxes to be equipped with magnetic chip detectors. These chip detectorsare needed to alert the crew of impending failure of ferromagnetic componentsin these transmissions and gearboxes. No comments were received, and thisproposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-36. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.1521to add new paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) which establish and define thepowerplant limitations associated with OEI ratings. These new paragraphswill ensure proper recognition in the powerplant limitations listing requiredby andSection; 27.1583(b). No comments were received, and this proposal isadopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-37. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 27.1549to add a new paragraph (e) which requires arrangement of instrument markingsfor OEI ratings to be clearly differentiated from the normal operatinglimits. This will ensure that instruments are marked to avoid or minimizepossible inadvertent use of OEI ratings when operation of the rotorcraftshould be limited to the normal operating limits. No comments were receivedon this proposal; however, it was subsequently noted that the proposedwording would preclude use of the 2\1/2\-minute OEI power rating to achievea safe one-engine-inoperative climbout after a balked landing or to avoidthe hazardous zones of the HV diagram if the associated engine failureoccurred in conjunction with flight conditions which dictate use of thispower. This was not intended or justified, and a revision to this sectioneliminates this possiblilty. The revision is editorial only. <T3>Proposal 3-38. </T3>The notice proposed to amend paragraph (c) of andSection;29.45 to require published rotorcraft performance to be adjusted conservativelyto account for powerplant instrument error. One commenter objects statingthat the proposed rule is unnecessary because the subject of powerplantinstrument accuracy is already adequately addressed in the guidance containedin paragraph 55 of FAA Advisory Circular 29-2A, ``Certification of TransportCategory Rotorcraft,'' dated September 16, 1987. As a result, not justof this comment, out after a review of several similar discussions in CommitteeII_Propulsion, held at the New Orleans Rotorcraft Regulatory Review Conference,the FAA agrees that the current regulation is adequate on a standalonebasis. Accordingly, this proposal is withdrawn. <T3>Proposal 3-39. </T3>The notice proposed to introduce in andSection; 29.67a requirement to determine climb performance at the new ``continuous''OEI rating discussed in detail in the explanation for Proposal 3-3 andto revise the term ``30-minute power'' to read ``30-minute OEI power.''The new wording of andSection; 29.67 sets forth the requirements for performanceat the continuous OEI rating as parallel, alternative performance availableto rotorcraft which have met the corresponding component and system qualificationsspecified by this proposal. Subsequent to issuance of the NPRM, it wasbrought to the attention of the FAA that engine installations may be designedwith a critical engine. The proposal, if adopted, would not account forthis design although the original intent was to determine climb performancewith loss of the engine in a ``worst-case'' situation; i.e., the most criticalengine. As a result, the rule as adopted has been clarified to substitute``the critical engine inoperative'' for ``one engine inoperative.'' Thesechanges will clarify the eligibility and requirements associated with thisnew continuous one-engine-inoperative rating. No comments were received,and the proposal is adopted with only the change noted.<T3>Proposal 3-40. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 29.361 toset forth new and more realistic design limit torque requirements for turbineengine installations. For a discussion of this proposal, see the discussionunder Proposal 3-4 pertaining to andSection; 27.361. Comments received forthis proposal are identical to comments received for Proposal 3-4. Accordingly,Proposal 3-40 is adopted with the same changes discussed in Proposal 3-4.<T3>Proposal 3-41. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 29.549(e)to add the term ``OEI'' to the existing term ``2\1/2\-minute power.'' Theterm ``OEI'' is a new abbreviation added to andSection; 1.2 by this amendment.This change standardizes and clarifies the title and limitations appropriatefor the use of 2\1/2\-minute OEI power. No comments were received on thisproposal. It is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-42. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 29.901 byrevising paragraph (b)(2), adding a new paragraph (b)(6), and revisingparagraph (c). For an explanation of the part of the proposal to revise paragraph (b)(2)and to add a new paragraph (b)(6), see Proposal 3-7. No comments were received,and this part of the proposal is adopted without change. The proposed change to paragraph (c) would limit the scope of the powerplantsystems fault analysis to ``single failure or malfunction or probable combinationof related secondary failures.'' Several commenters object to the new wordingof paragraph (c) on the grounds that limiting the analysis to ``related''secondary failures could result in a lower level of safety. These commenters,who have extensive experience with application of the corresponding rulein Part 25 for transport airplanes, deny that the wording as it now existswould cause a ``proliferation of endless failure modes and effects analysis''as contended by the original proponents of the proposed wording. In viewof these comments and the FAA's general objective of not lowering the levelof safety, the proposed change to paragraph (c) of andSection; 29.901 iswithdrawn. <T3>Proposal 3-43. </T3>The notice proposed several changes to andSection;29.903. The first change adds a requirement to paragraph (a) that reciprocatingengines used in helicopters must be qualified in accordance with the specialhelicopter engine testing requirements in andSection; 33.49(d). This changeis needed to ensure that this aspect is not overlooked when such enginesare installed in Part 29 programs. No comments were received on this partof the proposal. It is adopted without change. Another change revises paragraph (b)(2) to identify and clarify crew action;i.e., normal pilot action allowable with primary flight controls, in determiningif adequate powerplant systems isolation is provided. Most, if not all,of the power lever motion for rotorcraft engines is mechanically or electronicallyaffected by the flight controls, and this change eliminates any possibleconfusion that may exist regarding the acceptability of modifying optimumflight control manipulation to protect engine parameters. No comments werereceived on this part of the proposal. It is adopted as proposed. New paragraph (c)(3) is added and changes existing paragraph (c) from simplyrequiring restart capability to requiring the restart capability to beavailable throughout a flight envelope appropriate to the rotorcraft. Thiswill avoid the concept that an in-flight engine restart envelope whichis minimal and impractical constitutes acceptable compliance with thisrule. Due to a printing error, the word ``appropriate'' was omitted from theFederal Register publication of Proposal 3-43. Paragraph (c)(3) shouldread, ``Engine restart capability must be established throughout a flightenvelope appropriate to the rotorcraft.'' A commenter notes the ommission and suggests that the engine restart capabilityshould be established throughout a defined flight envelope. This alternatewording, however, could result in certification of rotorcraft with a restartcapability so limited as to be of little or no use to the crew. Anothercommenter suggests that the requirement for an air restart envelope shouldinclude restart capability throughout the flight envelope of the rotorcraft.However, this wording could be interpreted to require restart at the extremesof the flight envelope. Neither of these suggestions are justified and,therefore, the proposal is adopted with the editorial change to paragraph(c)(3) as discussed. <T3>Proposal 3-44. </T3>The notice proposed to amend paragraph (a) of andSection;29.908 to require the rotorcraft to have the capability of safe operation,including adequate cooling, following a cooling fan failure. Under theexisting rule, fan failure modes could be accepted which may result inhazards to the rotorcraft caused by loss of cooling air to critical powerplantcomponents. The notice also proposed a new paragraph (c) requiring a determinationthat cooling fans which are not part of the rotor drive system are notsubject to fan blade resonant conditions within the operating limits ofthe rotorcraft. This will ensure that cooling fans which by location ordefinition may not be included in other fatigue tests or evaluations areevaluated for possible fatigue failure. Finally, the title of this paragraphhas been changed from ``Failure Evaluation'' to ``Fatigue Evaluation''to be consistent with the subject material of the paragraph as revised.No comments were received, and this proposal is adopted without change.<T3>Proposal 3-45. </T3>The notice proposed a number of amendments to andSection;29.923. These include editorial changes, additional endurance test criteriafor a new continuous OEI rating, and clarification of the torque and r.p.m.relation intended for the various power ratings involved in the tests prescribedby this section. Paragraph (a)(1) is amended to require the test cycle to be extended beyond10 hours if OEI rating tests are included in the test program. This changeis needed to maintain the cyclic aspect of the test if OEI ratings areincluded. Paragraph (a)(3) is amended to include rotational speed as a part of thetest because the term ``torque'' by itself does not adequately define thetest. Paragraph (a)(3)(ii) is amended for clarity. Paragraphs (b)(2), (f), and (k) are amended to add the test requirementsfor the new continuous OEI rating and retain, as an alternate, the 30-minuteOEI rating tests for those applicants who may request this rating. Thischange provides a regulatory test basis for qualifying the rotor drivesystem for optional OEI ratings. Paragraph (g) is amended to remove the inference that the 2\1/2\-minuteOEI runs must be repeated if the takeoff run is reconducted. Under thesecircumstances, additional testing for the 2\1/2\-minute rating is unnecessaryfor safety.Additional amendments are made to paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (h),and (k) to clarify the provisions with respect to power parameters to ensurethat appropriate torque and rotational speeds are used during the tests.No comments were received on this proposal, and it is adopted without change.<T3>Proposal 3-46. </T3>The notice proposed several amendments to andSection;29.927. Paragraph (c) is changed by revising and extending the rotor drivesystem lubrication failure test requirements for Category A rotorcraftand by clarifying the corresponding test requirements for Category B rotorcraft.Category A aircraft must have significant continued flight capability aftera failure in order to optimize eventual landing opportunities. However,indefinite flight following the lubrication system failure is not expected.The changes to the Category B rotorcraft drive system lubrication failuretest requirements are largely for clarification and are not substantive.A commenter notes that paragraph (c), as proposed, could be interpretedto preclude credit for auxiliary lubrication systems or to require considerationof lubricant failures to self-lubricated bearings. This was not intended,and the wording of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) has been revised to eliminatethis possible ambiguity. The change to the overspeed test requirements in paragraph (d) removesthe arbitrary requirement of 120 percent and substitutes a more realisticone which will relate to the operating characteristics of the rotorcraft.This change is needed because the existing 120 percent overspeed requirementmay be unnecessarily severe for some rotorcraft. An additional change eliminatesthe requirement for accomplishing the acceleration phase of the overspeedtests within 10 seconds when the maximum acceleration rate of the enginerequires more time. This will avoid special engine fuel control modificationsfor test purposes which are unnecessary and may damage the engine. One commenter suggests that the overspeed tests required by paragraph (d)should be limited to the speed associated with speed and torque limitingdevices. The FAA concurs with this comment provided that the speed andtorque limiting device is reliable and independent from the normal enginecontrol for rotational speed, and the amendment reflects this concept.The same commenter also suggests that the overspeed tests required in paragraph(d) should be limited to 105 percent of the maximum rotational speed, notconsidering transients. The FAA does not concur since it is essential thatoverspeed above the maximum expected transient speed be demonstrated toassure a margin of safety for this condition. Further change to andSection; 27.927 is made to add a new paragraph (f) whichrequires each individual test specified by this section to be conductedwithout intervening disassembly and, except for the lubrication failuretests of paragraph (c), requires each part tested to be in a serviceablecondition at the conclusion of the test. Intervening disassembly is unacceptablesince it can invalidate the required serviceability findings. The serviceabilityrequirement is needed to ensure that only test results which are satisfactorymay be used to show compliance. One commenter incorrectly assumes that new paragraph (f) requires all testsunder andSection; 29.927 to be conducted in the sequence listed in the sectionand on the same test specimen. New paragraph (f) is intended to require,in part, the test specified by any selected paragraph, such as the 200applications of torque specified by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, tobe conducted without intervening disassembly on any one specimen of therotor drive system. This proposal is adopted with the changes discussed. <T3>Proposal 3-47. </T3>For an explanation of new andSection; 29.954, seethe explanation for Proposal 3-11. No comments were received on this proposal,and it is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-48. </T3>For an explanation and a discussion of the commentsrelated to the proposed changes to andSection; 29.955, see the discussionof Proposal 3-12. As a result of the comments received for Proposal 3-12,corresponding changes have been incorporated into this proposal, and itis adopted with those changes. <T3>Proposal 3-49. </T3>The notice proposed an amendment to andSection; 29.961to simplify and restate the fuel system hot weather qualification requirements.This would eliminate detail requirements in the existing rule which wereto some extent redundant or not necessarily critical for some rotorcraft.No comments were received on this proposal. The phrase ``including, ifapplicable, the engine operating conditions defined by andSection;andSection;29.927 (b)(1) and (b)(2)'' is added in the amendment to be consistent withthe corresponding amendment being made to andSection; 27.961 and to ensurethat certain critical qualification aspects are properly considered. Thischange is clarifying in nature and falls within the scope of the notice.The proposal is adopted with only this editorial addition. <T3>Proposal 3-50. </T3>For comments related to the proposed revision toparagraph (b) of andSection; 29.963, see the discussion of Proposal 3-14.As indicated in that discussion, the higher load factor requirements forfuel tanks may not be appropriate and, therefore, the proposed change toparagraph (b) is withdrawn. For an explanation of the proposal to add a new paragraph (e) to andSection;29.963, see the discussion for Proposal 3-14. No comments were receivedon this part of the proposal, and it is adopted as proposed. <T3>Proposal 3-51. </T3>The notice proposed an amendment to remove paragraph(f) from andSection; 29.967. The requirements of paragraph (f) are adequatelycovered by andSection; 29.963. No comments were received, and the proposalis adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-52. </T3>For an explanation of this proposal to amend andSection;29.969, see the explanation for Proposal 3-15. No comments were received,and the proposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-53. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 29.971 torequire that fuel tank sump designs be arranged so that drainage to thesump area will occur with the rotorcraft parked in any ground attitudewhich can reasonably be expected in service. Current andSection; 29.971,which requires only that drainage to the sump be effective with the rotorcraftparked in the ``normal'' attitude, may not accomplish its intended purposewhen rotorcraft are parked on uneven terrain. No comments were received,and the proposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-54. </T3>For an explanation of this proposal to amend andSection;29.975, see Proposal 3-17. No comments were received, and the proposalis adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-55. </T3>For an explanation of this proposal which amendsandSection; 29.991, see Proposal 3-18. No comments were received, and theproposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-56. </T3>The proposal to amend andSection; 29.993 has beenwithdrawn. For an explanation, see the discussion of Proposal 3-19. <T3>Proposal 3-57. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 29.997 ina manner similar to Proposal 3-20 for andSection; 27.997. For a discussionof the comments received, see Proposal 3-20. The proposal is adopted withoutsubstantive change. <T3>Proposal 3-58. </T3>For an explanation of this proposal to amend andSection;29.999, see Proposal 3-21. No comments were received, and the proposalis adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-59. </T3>The notice proposed to add a new andSection; 29.1001to set forth certification safety standards for fuel jettisoning systems.While these systems are optional, this new section establishes the minimumsafety precautions which designers must consider when choosing to producesystems of this type. A commenter suggests that demonstration of fuel jettisoning during ``emergencydescent'' should not be required since it is not a condition that can bequantified and is not a normal flight regime. The FAA agrees that a requirementfor fuel jettisoning during emergency descent is unnecessary and that flightlimitations prescribed for use of the fuel jettisoning system are adequateto ensure safety. Another commenter suggests that jettisoned fuel shouldbe allowed to impinge on certain parts of the rotorcraft if no hazard isinvolved. Such a finding, if established, should be allowed for credittoward meeting this rule. The rule, as adopted, incorporates both of thesechanges.<T3>Proposal 3-60. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 29.1011by revising its title from ``General'' to ``Engines: General,'' by removingexisting paragraph (b), and by redesignating paragraphs (c), (d), and (e)as (b), (c), and (d), respectively. To be consistent with the restructuringof andSection; 29.1011, this amendment includes an editorial change to redesignatedparagraph (d) to remove the words ``* * * and rotor drive system * * *.''These changes will also coordinate the requirements of this section withnew andSection; 29.1027. No comments were received, and except for the deletionnoted, the proposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-61. </T3>For an explanation of this proposal to amend andSection;29.1019, see the explanation for Proposal 3-23. No comments were received,and the proposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-62. </T3>The notice proposed to add a new andSection; 29.1027,``Transmissions and Gearboxes: General,'' which contains the requirementsremoved from andSection; 29.1011 by Proposal 3-60 plus additional lubricationsystem requirements appropriate for transmissions and gearboxes. Theserequirements are derived from existing engine oil system requirements whichhave been adjusted or modified to suit the needs of transmissions and gearboxes.A commenter suggests that paragraph (b) should apply only to oil systemswhich employ separate tanks and not to systems which employ gearbox sumptype oil reservoirs. In response to the comment, the FAA has determinedthat the relevant oil system requirements are those relating to strength,including pressure tests, lines and fittings, vent arrangements, drains,vibration, and fire protection and that these requirements are valid forpressure lubrication systems regardless of the oil storage configuration.Nonpressurized splash lubrication arrangements are usually free from theproblems of pressurized systems and, therefore, should be exempt from thedetail requirements addressed above. This commenter's suggestion is, therefore,not incorporated. A second commenter suggests that paragraph (b) of the proposal is confusingand should be clarified to ensure proper application. The FAA concurs and,accordingly, has made several changes to identify specifically the pertinentparts of other oil system rules referenced in this proposal as well asto remove apparent redundancies. The third commenter suggests that paragraph (b)(2) should be revised torequire a coarse mesh screen in the scavenge to the oil pump rather thanthe tank or sump outlet screen specified by the proposal. The FAA doesnot concur since this would, in effect, remove the protection a tank outletscreen provides from trash, paper, or other objects which might enter thesystem via the tank filler opening. The proposal is adopted with the changes discussed. <T3>Proposal 3-63. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 29.1041to revise paragraph (a) to include the phrase ``for which certificationis requested.'' This change is needed to clarify and identify the rangeof operating conditions for which powerplant cooling provisions must beeffective. In addition, the notice proposed to amend paragraph (c) to exemptground-use-only auxiliary power units from the requirement for in-flightcooling tests. No comments were received, and the proposal is adopted withoutchange. <T3>Proposal 3-64. </T3>The notice proposed to add a new paragraph (a)(5)to andSection; 29.1043 which includes a definition of ``stabilization'' asit pertains to powerplant systems cooling tests. This will define moreclearly the extent of cooling tests and eliminate prolonged and unnecessaryextension of cooling tests which may be interpreted as required if testparameters continue to change slightly during the cooling test. No commentswere received and this proposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-65. </T3>The notice proposed to revise paragraph (c) ofandSection; 29.1045 to include requirements for the OEI en route climb coolingtests applicable to the new ``continuous OEI'' rating introduced in thisrulemaking. The existing OEI en route climb cooling test requirements arenot adequate to ensure proper evaluation of powerplant cooling parametersduring operation at this power rating. No comments were received, and thisproposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-66. </T3>The notice proposed to revise paragraph (a) ofandSection; 29.1047 to include requirements for the OEI takeoff/climb coolingtests applicable to the new ``continuous OEI'' rating for reasons similarto those in Proposal 3-65. No comments were received, and this proposalis adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-67. </T3>The notice proposed to restate paragraph (b)(1)of andSection; 29.1093 so that the phrase ``within the limitations establishedfor the rotorcraft'' applies only to the requirement in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)for demonstrating flight in falling and blowing snow. For an explanationof this proposal and a discussion of the comments received from the public,see Proposal 3-28. The notice also proposed to change the reference in paragraph (b) fromAppendix C of Part 25 to Appendix C of Part 29 to correlate the airframeicing requirements of andSection; 29.1419 to the powerplant icing requirementsof this section. These appendices are identical. The proposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-68. </T3>For an explanation of this proposal to amend andSection;29.1141, see the discussion for Proposal 3-29. No comments were received,and this proposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-69. </T3>The notice proposed to amend paragraphs (a) through(e) of andSection; 29.1143 to replace the terms ``throttle control'' and``thrust control'' with the more general term ``power control.'' For anexplanation of these changes, see the discussion for Proposal 3-30. Nocomments were received, and this proposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-70. </T3>The notice proposed to amend paragraph (d) of andSection;29.1163 to rephrase the design requirement for accessory drive torque limitingdevices so that the torque limiting device may be included in either theaccessory or the rotor drive system. For an explanation of this proposal,see the discussion for Proposal 3-31. No comments were received, and theproposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-71. </T3>The notice proposed to add a new paragraph (b)to andSection; 29.1181. Paragraph (b) reinstates a requirement pertainingto powerplant fire zones which was inadvertently dropped by Amendment 29-3(33 FR 956; January 26, 1968). Paragraph (b) requires that fire zones,as defined in this section, must be protected from powerplant fires inaccordance with specific protective systems defined in other associatedrules in the Part. No comments were received on this proposal, and it isadopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-72. </T3>The notice proposed to amend paragraph (e) of andSection;29.1189 to require flammable fluid shutoff devices and controls for thesedevices to be designed, located, and protected to function properly underconditions likely to result from a critical powerplant area fire. Thischange is needed to preclude approval of design arrangements wherein heatfrom an engine compartment fire is conducted through the firewall to theextent that it jeopardizes the operation of these shutoff devices. The notice also proposed to amend paragraph (f) to exempt ground-use-onlyauxiliary power unit shutoff devices from the requirement for a guardedcontrol. This eliminates the need for a design feature when no flight orground safety objective is involved. No comments were received, and this proposal is adopted without change.<T3>Proposal 3-73. </T3>This proposal adds a new paragraph (f) to andSection;29.1193 which would, in effect, require redundant retention means for eachopenable or readily removable panel, cowling, engine, or rotor drive systemcovering. For an explanation of this proposal and the comment received,see the discussion for Proposal 3-33. This proposal is adopted withoutchange.<T3>Proposal 3-74. </T3>The notice proposed to revise, edit, and add newpowerplant instrument requirements to andSection; 29.1305. For a discussion of the revisions to paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(17), and (a)(19),see Proposal 3-34. New paragraph (a)(20) combines into one rule, without substantative change,the existing identical requirements for fuel pressure indicators currentlycontained in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(2) of this section and further modifiesthe applicability of this requirement to only those fuel systems with devicesor components which, in the event of failure, could adversely affect fuelpressure at the engine. These changes are needed to simplify the presentationin this section for fuel pressure indicators and to eliminate the requirementfor fuel pressure indicators in fuel systems such as suction or gravityfeed systems which do not incorporate pumps, filters, etc., subject todeterioration which could be reflected on a fuel pressure indicator. New paragraph (a)(21) requires a warning device to indicate the failureof any fuel pump required for adequate fuel flow to the engine. This alertsthe flightcrew that fuel flow and engine operation are now dependent onthe emergency system and to institute precautionary operating procedures.New paragraph (a)(22) adds a requirement for a warning or caution deviceto alert the flightcrew when particles are detected by the chip detectorrequired by new andSection; 29.1337(d) proposed as another amendment to thispart. This amendment is one of a two-part amendment to require chip detectorsand associated warning signals to alert the crew to possible impendingfailures in rotorcraft transmissions and gearboxes. These devices havebeen found to be a relatively inexpensive method of significantly improvingthe safety of rotorcraft in these respects. New paragraph (a)(23) adds a requirement for powerplant instruments orwarning devices for auxiliary power units installed in rotorcraft. Thisensures that flightcrews will have indicators or warning devices neededto avoid possible unsafe conditions which may be expected during operationof auxiliary power units. Additional editorial changes to existing paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(2) havebeen added to integrate new paragraph (a)(20) with these other provisions.No comments were received, and this proposal is adopted without change.<T3>Proposal 3-75. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 29.1337to add a new paragraph (e) to require certain rotor drive system transmissionsand gearboxes to be equipped with chip detector systems which detect andsignal the presence of ferromagnetic particles to the flightcrew. Also,the amendment requires a means to permit crewmembers to check, in flight,the function of each detector's electrical circuit and signal. Becausenot all chips generated in a transmission or gearbox will be detected bythese magnetic detectors, the amendment does not include extensive performancerequirements for these systems. However, these devices have been foundto be a relatively inexpensive and effective method of detecting impendingmechanical failures in gearboxes. This amendment will improve the levelof safety available with the installation of chip detector systems. A commenter notes that in Proposal 3-35 (andSection; 27.1337), chip detectorswould be required for ``rotor drive system transmissions and gearboxes,''whereas in this proposal, affecting Part 29, chip detectors would be requiredonly for ``transmission gearboxes.'' This inconsistency between the twoparts is not intended and paragraph (e) is changed to agree with the amendmentto andSection; 27.1337(c). This commenter also suggests removal of the phrase``when ferromagnetic particles exist in the vicinity of the detector.''The FAA agrees that these words are unnecessary, and this phrase has beenremoved. Accordingly, this proposal is adopted with the changes discussed. <T3>Proposal 3-76. </T3>The notice proposed to revise paragraphs (f) and(g) and add a new paragraph (h) to andSection; 29.1521. The changes to paragraphs(f) and (g) introduce the term ``OEI'' to emphasize and clarify the limitationson the use of the 2\1/2\-minute and 30-minute power ratings as definedin this section. This amendment also correlates the title of these ratingsto their definitions in Part 1, as revised by this amendment. Additionally,these changes add the introductory phrase ``unless otherwise authorized,''in order to authorize use of these ratings when appropriate, additionalqualification testing or other adequate safety measures have been instituted.Also, both paragraphs (f) and (g) have been reworded to set forth specificallythe limitations on the use of these ratings. These changes are intendedto assist the public in avoiding misconceptions regarding the eligibilityof these ratings. New paragraph (h) establishes and defines a new continuous OEI power ratingusing terminology similar to that developed by this amendment for the 2\1/2\-minuteand 30-minute power ratings. This change ensures proper recognition inthe powerplant limitations listing required by andSection; 29.1583. No comments were received on this proposal; however, it was subsequentlynoted that the proposed wording would preclude use of the 2\1/2\-minuteOEI power rating to achieve a safe one-engine-inoperative climbout aftera balked landing or to avoid the hazardous zones of the HV diagram if theassociated engine failure occurred in conjunction with flight conditionswhich dictate use of this power. This was not intended or justified andthis section, as adopted, clarifies this aspect. <T3>Proposal 3-77. </T3>The notice proposed to add a new paragraph (e)and make associated editorial changes to andSection; 29.1549 to set forthrequirements for powerplant instrument markings applicable to the OEI ratingseligible on certain rotorcraft. For an explanation of this proposal andits disposition, see the explanation for Proposal 3-37. <T3>Proposal 3-78. </T3>The notice proposed to revise paragraph (c)(1)(iii)of andSection; 29.1557 to permit, for turbine-powered rotorcraft, the useof flight manual listings of approved fuels in lieu of decals and placardsat the fuel filler openings, as required by the existing rule. The listingof approved fuels is, in some instances, too extensive to include on decalsor placards in the space available. No comments were received, and theproposal is adopted without change. <T3>Proposal 3-79. </T3>The notice proposed to revise paragraph (c) ofandSection; 33.7 to add to the list of ratings and limitations the new ``continuousOEI power'' rating discussed in Proposal 3-3. This amendment will ensurerecognition and correlation of this new rating to Part 33 test requirements.Paragraphs (c)(1)(v) and (c)(1)(vi) have been revised in the amendmentby adding the term ``OEI'' to the phrases ``rated 30-minute power'' and``rated 2\1/2\-minute power'' to be consistent with the addition of thisterm to other appropriate sections of this part. No comments were received,and this proposal is adopted with the editorial changes noted. <T3>Proposal 3-80. </T3>The notice proposed to amend andSection; 33.87 asfollows: Paragraphs (a) and (b) are revised to include reference to the test runnecessary to qualify rotorcraft engines for the new continuous OEI ratingconsistent with amendments to other sections of this subpart. Additionally,paragraph (b)(2) is restated for clarification, without substantive change.Paragraph (d) is revised and redesignated as paragraph (e) and a new paragraph(d) is added to prescribe the test requirements for the new continuousOEI rating. Newly redesignated paragraph (e), pertaining to the 2\1/2\-minute OEI rating,is revised to incorporate the option of combining this rating with theconventional takeoff and maximum continuous power ratings or with eitherof the en route OEI ratings. The reference in the last sentence of (e)(1)is changed from (c)(5) to (d)(6) for consistency in paragraph numbering.The word ``rotorcraft'' is substituted for ``helicopter'' throughout andSection;33.87 to be consistent with the broader installation applications of turboshaftengines. The term ``OEI'' is added to existing ``30-minute power'' and``2\1/2\-minute power'' phrases used in paragraphs (c), new (d), and (e).In addition, the words ``and thrust'' are removed from the phrase ``powerand thrust'' in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) since rotorcraft engines arenot normally thrust-rated. These changes coordinate the test requirements related to the new continuousOEI power rating and eliminate unnecessarily restrictive requirements forqualification for the 2\1/2\-minute OEI power rating. A commenter expresses concern that the proposed block test schedule forthe continuous OEI power rating differs unnecessarily from the block testschedule prescribed for engines by the Joint Airworthiness Requirements(JAR) for the similarly used intermediate contingency power rating. Thecommenter indicates that these differences exist in the maximum continuouspower run and the incremental power run and recommends a 12\1/2\-hour increasein incremental power running at the expense of time spent testing at maximumcontinuous power. The FAA disagrees. In this proposal, the time of testingat incremental power for the continuous OEI power rating is the same (50hours) as that which has been found satisfactory for the 30-minute OEIpower rating. The redistribution of test time at maximum continuous powerand above is introduced to account for the fact that the continuous OEIpower rating is not time limited (as is the 30-minute OEI power rating)and thus, should have a proportionate amount of associated qualificationtest time. The same commenter notes that in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>publication of the NPRM, the sentence, ``Forengines tested under paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, theprescribed 6-hour test sequence must be conducted 25 times to completethe required 150 hours of operation,'' was inadvertently omitted from andSection;33.87(a). The same commenter also notes that in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>publication, the title line of proposed andSection;33.87(c) should have read ``* * * for which a 30-minute OEI power * * *,'';and that the word ``hour'' was omitted from the first sentence of proposedandSection; 33.87(e)(1). These changes with corrected wording have been madein the amendment. This commenter finally notes that Amendment 33-10 (49 FR 6852; February23, 1984) added 5 minutes to the endurance test requirements of andSection;33.87(d) for certification of the 2\1/2\-minute OEI rating. He contendsthis further jeopardizes the uniformity of requirements between the FARand the JAR. This change to Part 33 was introduced as part of the EngineRegulatory Review Program, NPRM No. 80-21, Docket No. 16919, and becameeffective in February 1984. This comment is, therefore, beyond the scopeof the notice and cannot be considered in this rulemaking. This proposal is adopted with the changes discussed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Summary </ITAG>A regulatory evaluation of the amendments published herein has been preparedand filed in the docket. This evaluation addresses the pertinent requirementsof the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Executive Order 12291, Departmentof Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979) and the impact on international trade. A summary of this evaluationfollows. Seventy of the amendments reflect current rotorcraft industry practiceor clarify existing rules and, therefore, impose negligible or no additionalcosts and in some cases will result in savings. Amendments in this categoryare listed in Table 1. A second group of 12 amendments, listed in Table II, pertain to safetystandards for optional equipment or to new optional rotorcraft powerplantoperating limitations. The FAA assumes that since these equipment itemsand powerplant ratings are optional, they will only be introduced intoany model rotorcraft if the manufacturer of that rotorcraft determinesthat the benefits of such action will exceed the costs. One option thatmay result in an economic benefit is the introduction of a new continuousone-engine-inoperative rating which will permit rotorcraft manufacturersto qualify certain rotorcraft to perform long-range missions at gross weightsapproaching those now associated with use of the existing 30-minute OEIrating. Corresponding improvements in productivity should also be expected.A third group of proposals listed in Table III was identified as havingsignificant cost impact. For these proposals, the FAA's analysis of thecosts and benefits failed to show that the imposition of these proposalswas justified. These proposals were not included in the final rule andare being deferred for further study. They may appear in subsequent noticesif they are found to be warranted.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>I._<T4>Rule Changes With Zero or Negligible Compliance Costs</T4><H1>Item No.</H1><H1>FAR

was enacted by Congress toensure that small entities are not disproportionately affected by Governmentregulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules which may have a``significant economic impact'' on a substantial number of small entities.Within the context of these amendments, the FAA definition of a small entityis a small rotorcraft manufacturer with less than 75 employees. Under these``small entity'' size standard criteria, only three of eleven helicoptermanufacturers in business today is a small entity. The FAA estimates that there will be six new helicopters certificated beforethe year 2000. Three are expected to be Part 27 helicopters and three Part29 helicopters. The three new Part 29 helicopters are expected to be certificatedby three of eight large firms. Of the three new Part 27 helicopters, twoare expected to be certificated by large firms and one by a small firm.Clearly, the final rule changes will not impact a substantial number ofsmall entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Trade Impact Analysis </ITAG>This section discusses the impact of these amendments on the sale of foreignrotorcraft in the United States and the sale of U.S. rotorcraft in foreigncountries. Since the certification rules are applicable to both foreign and domesticentities which manufacture rotorcraft to sell in the United States, therewill be no competitive advantage to either. Because of the large U.S. market,foreign manufacturers are likely to certify their rotorcraft to U.S. rulesand, therefore, U.S. manufacturers would not suffer a disadvantage in foreignmarkets. Those amendments which reduce the life cycle cost of rotorcraft shouldaid in developing increased sales in the United States since it can beexpected that a decrease in price should stimulate sales. Because manyforeign countries follow U.S. certification rules, foreign sales by U.S.manufacturers should also increase. <ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications </ITAG>The regulations set forth in this amendment are promulgated pursuant tothe authority in the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 U.S.C.1301 <T3>et seq.</T3>), which statute is construed to preempt State law regulatingthe same subject. Thus, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it isdetermined that such regulation does not have federalism implications warrantingthe preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>In the context of these analyses, it is concluded that this rule is notmajor under Executive Order 12291 or significant under DOT Regulatory Policiesand Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). Further, based on thefindings made with respect to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, I certifythat this rule will not have a significant economic impact, positive ornegative, on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>14 CFR Part 1Airmen, Flights, Aircraft pilots, Pilots, Air safety, Safety, Air transportation,Air carriers, Aircraft, Helicopters, Rotorcraft. 14 CFR Part 27 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety, Rotorcraft. 14 CFR Part 29Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety, Rotorcraft. 14 CFR Part 33Engines, Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. <ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, Parts l, 27, 29, and 33 of the Federal Aviation Regulations(14 CFR Parts 1, 27, 29, and 33) are amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1_DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS </ITAG>1.
