Intramolecular radical displacement reactions atsulfur may contribute to the formation of the thiophene ring structureand aryl-substituted homologues in competition with pathways involvingintramolecular addition of arylthio radicals to nearby aromatic systems.This paper presents results of a kinetic study of intramolecular radicaldisplacement at sulfur and discusses results of an ab initio many-bodyperturbation theory (MBPT) study of the trimethyl sulfuranyl radical,a model for possible intermediate trialkylsulfuranyl radicals in thedisplacement reactions. Arrhenius expressions for intramolecular displacementof a variety of alkyl groups are discussed in terms of intermediate trialkylsulfuranylradicals versus simple tricoordinate transition structures. The levelof theoretical treatment to obtain accuracy comparable to experimentis evaluated, and theoretical predictions of the energetics and the extentof stereochemical control in radical displacement reactions at sulfurare discussed. 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
