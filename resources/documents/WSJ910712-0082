President Bush's executive order lifting sanctions underthe Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 will encourageother nations to allow trade with South Africa whileAmericans face continued obstacles. The long list of U.S.state, county and local sanctions against South Africa andthe federal law allowing double taxation of Americancompanies in South Africa remain a hindrance to U.S.investment.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We're going to step up our export drive because a lotmore markets will be open to us now,&quot; said Spencer Sterling,group managing director of the South African Motor Corp., orSamcor. He says Samcor is looking for markets in Europe,Japan and other African countries -- not the U.S. He expectsto increase the shipment of parts and cars to those areas,while the U.S. market remains essentially closed.   The lifting of several U.S. sanctions &quot;will give us theopportunity to hunt for niche opportunities in markets thatweren't previously open to us,&quot; he said. And when Japanfollows the American lead, Mazda Motor Corp. will opendiscussions with Samcor about securing an equity interest,Mr. Sterling added.   Samcor was formed in 1985 when Ford Motor Co. began itsdivestment from South Africa, completed two years later. Fordnow holds no equity in Samcor, Mr. Sterling said. But, headded, &quot;we would very much like the Ford Motor Co. to becomea shareholder again.&quot; Samcor is licensed to make Fordproducts and the South African company is supplied by Fordfrom Europe and Japan. American autos imports aren't likelyto dent the South Africa market, he said, because of theirright-hand drive, their use of unleaded gasoline and becausethe exchange rate makes them too expensive.   Other successor companies to American concerns that pulledout of South Africa five years ago see few major changes intheir situation from the president's action.   &quot;We don't see any dramatic changes taking placeimmediately, either to the economy or the IT (informationtechnology) industry,&quot; said Erica Brown, a spokeswoman forInformation Services Management, or ISM. &quot;But there will besome increase in competition. That, I suppose, will behealthy.&quot;   ISM was created by an employee buy-out of IBM, whichsupplies ISM with products. ISM Managing Director Brian Mehl,in a statement, said he hopes the lifting of sanctions &quot;willhave a positive impact on the anti-South African pressuregroups, as well as state and local government legislation inthe U.S. which discriminates against companies doing businesswith South Africa.&quot;   Much of that legislation prohibits companies that dobusiness with South Africa from doing business with state orlocal governments. In his statement announcing the lifting ofcertain U.S. sanctions, President Bush called on state andlocal governments to follow his lead.   Wayne Mitchell, executive director of the American Chamberof Commerce in Johannesburg, said that the president'sdecision would boost business confidence in South Africa, butthat U.S. corporate money won't flow until there is anegotiated settlement, a democratic government and aninvestment code to protect investors.</TEXT></DOC>
