A 49ers source said the decision on thefinal five cuts was made between 11 a.m. and the 1 p.m. deadline -- at whichtime Paris' fate was decided.;   Paris left quickly, not even stopping to talkto teammates. He could not be reached at his San Jose home, but his agent,Bill Hedden, said Paris seemed to be handling the news well.;   &quot;He seems fineand he's looking toward the future,&quot; said Hedden, who was surprised by thenews. &quot;He feels like he's in the best shape of his life.&quot;;   Paris, widelyregarded as one of the league's best left tackles when he refrains fromtackling the buffet line, now sits on the NFL waiver wire, where he almostsurely will be picked up by another team.;   &quot;He'll play for somebody becauseof the way he plays left tackle,&quot; said Steve Wallace, who replaced Paris aftermoving from right tackle. &quot;He's one of the best in the league, as long as he'slight.&quot;;   Paris' troubles this season were well-documented. After he reportedto training camp two pounds over a team-mandated 325-pound weight limit,Paris' health became a concern when it was discovered he had dangerously highcholesterol and uric-acid levels in his blood, the results of a crash diet.;  Weeks of strenuous workouts with 49ers physical development coordinator JerryAttaway pared Paris down physically, but his technique had been whittled downas well.;   His four-week absence, meanwhile, caused a shuffling of theoffensive line. Harris Barton, for one, was upset about being moved from guardto tackle and lashed out at Paris for not reporting to camp in shape.;  Tuesday, Barton said he wasn't necessarily upset with Paris personally, &quot;butwhen they moved me, I thought it was unfair, and that's why I opened up.&quot;;  Left guard Guy McIntyre thought Paris' lengthy conditioning hiatus made ithard for him to catch up to his teammates.;   &quot;Obviously, they (the coaches)feel like they gave him that chance,&quot; said McIntyre, who played beside Parisfor three years. &quot;Obviously, it's something that has been there, and they feltthis was the time to do it.&quot;;   The obvious question remains: Why make Pariswork out with Attaway if his chances weren't so hot?;   &quot;I think that's ourresponsibility,&quot; Seifert said.;   For backups at tackle, the 49ers now willmake do with two youngsters -- Frank Pollack, a sixth-round pick last season,and this season's fifth-rounder, Harry Boatswain.;   Among others biddingadieu to Santa Clara: guard Ricky Siglar, who, along with Paris, had beenprotected during the Plan B free agency signing period; quarterback RalphMartini; wide receiver Pete Mandley; safety Louis Riddick, the team'sninth-round draft choice, and wide receiver Bobby Slaughter, the 11th-roundpick.; ROSTER CUTS;   Players cut by the 49ers as they reduced their roster to60 on the NFL's first mandatory cut-down date:;   (box) C Dean Caliguire;  (box) WR Gary Compton;   (box) RB James Gray;   (box) LB Dan Grayson;   (box)LB Stacey Harvey;   (box) DE Milford Hodge;   (box) TE Darryl Ingram;   (box)DE Greg Joelson;   (box) WR Pete Mandley;   (box) QB Ralph Martini;   (box) TBubba Paris;   (box) CB Bruce Plummer;   (box) S Louis Riddick;   (box) DEJohn Shannon;   (box) G-T Ricky Siglar;   (box) WR Bobby Slaughter;   (box) LBChris Washington;   (box) NT Kent Wells;   (box) G-C Brent Wiese; -- Nancy Gay  </TEXT><BYLINE>  NANCY GAY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910821  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  731  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, August 21, 199100234157,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
