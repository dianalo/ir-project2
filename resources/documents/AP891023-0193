It has spawned what many anxious Pakistanis call a ``heroin andKalashnikov culture'' of crime, referring to the preferredautomatic weapon of the region's drug lords.   Most of the brightly colored poppies are grown in neighboringAfghanistan, where 11 years of civil war have precluded any attemptto control their cultivation.   Officials say the flowers' sticky yield of opium is refined intoheroin powder in makeshift laboratories along the ruggedPakistan-Afghan frontier. It is then spirited through Pakistan tomarkets in the United States and Europe.   Western narcotics agents estimate that up to 80 percent of theheroin sold in Europe and 25 percent sold in the United Statescomes from the so-called ``Golden Crescent'' region of SouthwestAsia.</TEXT></DOC>
