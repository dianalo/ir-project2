 Some users contend that the virus may havebeen accidentally distributed by Ashton-Tate, since the disks arewrapped at the factory.andP;  However, there is no exact determinationon how a virus gets on a disk.andP;  As a result, users are warned toexamine all of their software - no matter what the source - forindications of a virus.andP;  Several 'disinfectant' programs exist tocheck a disk for a virus before use.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Ashton-Tate (investigations).andO;Product:   Apple Macintosh (Microcomputer) (computer programs).andO;Topic:     Computer CrimesComputer VirusesPreventive MaintenanceSoftware Maintenance.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Unraveling viral, keyboard mysteriesandM;RIC FORD AND RICK LEPAGEandM;BUGS andamp; TIPSandM;The case of the shrink-wrapped disks.andP;  In response to our Sept. 19 columnabout Ashton-Tate's tech support problems in dealing with a possible virusinfection, we heard from some higher-level people at the company.andP;  Theyinvestigated the problem in detail and concluded that none of their samplerdisks contain any viruses.andM;Sal Fabozzi, president of TechniLogic Inc., a Lakewood, N.J., computerconsulting firm, was the reader who reported that he had found the nVIR Avirus on FullWrite and Full Impact sampler disks.andM;After detailed discussions with Ashton-Tate support people, Fabozzi said heis still sure that the virus came in on shrink-wrapped samplers ordered fromAshton-Tate.andM;&quot;After reviewing the sampler through various viral detection methods, I foundthat there was a virus that came in on the sampler itself,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I'mconvinced there was no other way a virus could have infected the machine.&quot;andM;Don Rittner also ran into some viruses on shrink-wrapped Ashton-Tate samplerdisks.andM;Rittner runs the Macintosh Users Group News Service of Schenectady, N.Y.andP;  Themonthly news service grew out of discussions at a national Apple Users Groupconference when it became apparent that many smaller groups did not haveaccess to enough material for their newsletters.andP;  The news service collectsmaterial from many sources, then adds shareware and articles by Rittner anddistributes a disk to users group newsletter editors without charge.andO;Corporate sponsors pay for the cost of the disks and sometimes contributesamples of their  products.andM;Rittner said Ashton-Tate agreed to sponsor a distribution but later pulledout.andP;  The company, however, sent him thousands of shrink-wrapped samplerdisks anyway.andP;  Rittner said he opened some of the samplers, checked them withDisinfectant and found a handful that had viral infections.andM;Tracking the source of viruses can be very difficult, and it's hard to proveconclusively whether Ashton-Tate is guilty or innocent of accidentallydistributing a virus.andP;  There obviously is not a widespread problem with thesamplers or we would have heard more complaints.andP;  In both cases, however, thereader reporting the problem was an experienced computer user familiar withviral prevention techniques.andM;The moral to these stories is clear: You cannot trust anyone, even a largecompany, to do your virus checking for you.andP;  We recommend very strongly thatyou test disks from any source (even Apple) for viruses before allowing themon your Mac.andP;  Effective utilities like Symantec's SAM programs make it easy,and utilities such as Disinfectant and CE Software's Vaccine are availablefree from users groups and on-line services.andM;Ghosts on the bus.andP;  The saga of Microsoft Excel 2.2 and the Datadesk 101keyboard is complete (see MacInTouch, Aug.andP;  15 and Sept.andP;  19).andP;  An INIT(Startup document) from Datadesk International called Excellerator eliminatesthe slowdowns users have encountered while running Excel 2.2.andM;According to Robert Solomon, Datadesk president, the problem arises fromroutines that Excel runs after it is launched.andP;  Excel notices an extendedkeyboard attached on the Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) and attempts to turn on thekeyboard's Num Lock light.andP;  There is no such light on the Datadesk 101, butExcel continues to poll the ADB, adding a &quot;phantom&quot; keyboard each time itdoes so until the bus is filled with imaginary devices and the Mac slows to acrawl.andM;Apple included a Num Lock light on its extended keyboard for users of MS-DOScoprocessor cards, but it does not support it in Mac software, so whyMicrosoft felt the need to do so is a mystery.andP;  Luckily for users, the INITis available on the networks and from Datadesk.andM;REFERENCEandM;Datadesk International, 7651 Haskell Ave., Van Nuys, Calif.andP;  91406; (818)780-1673.andM;MUG News Service, 1726 Lenox Road, Schenectady, N.Y.andP;
