The coefficient of modification of radiation transformationsof peptide (10/sup -4/ M) and protein (1.47x10/sup -4/ M) was shown tobe a function of nucleotide concentration representing smooth curveswith a plateau at the nucleotide concentration of above 2x10/sup -3/M. The extreme values of the modification coefficient vary from 0.35to 2.18 and from 1 to 2 for peptide and protein respectively. The experimentaldata follow the kinetic mechanism suggesting that the protective effectis implemented by the nucleotide reactions with hydroxyl radicals whereassensitization is implemented by the reactions of free radical nucleotideswith peptide and protein molecules.</TEXT></DOC>
