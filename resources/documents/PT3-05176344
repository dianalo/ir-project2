More specifically a net game pole support that has eliminated the use of      hazardous guy wire supports. </PAR><PAR>  1. Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  Poles and standards for supporting portable game nets are well known. The      more universal standards, such as those used for court games, generally      represent a compromise design which has several undesirable features.      Common detrimental aspects of these systems are the guy wires necessary to      support the pole. Guy wires are not only awkward but require considerable      time to install, often using several stakes that are driven into the      ground and affixed to the pole by wires, ropes or the like. The guy wires      or ropes and stakes create a dangerous situation to the players of the      game who may accidentally run into or trip over them causing personal      injury. Other common standards are designed to be placed into or otherwise      attached to permanent concrete blocks. The poles of such systems may be      removed with some conventional sets, but the support block stays in the      ground. Thus, they are not portable. </PAR><PAR>  2. Principal Object </PAR><PAR>  A principal object of this invention (net game pole support) is to provide      a support pole of simple structure that is also portable, i.e., one that      can be set up, utilized, and then removed. </PAR><PAR>  A further object of this invention is to avoid the necessity of guy wires      to support a game net pole. </PAR><PAR>  A further object of this invention is to provide a support pole which      enables rapid installation in a variety of soils including sand. </PAR><PAR>  A further object of this invention is to supply a support pole of simple      structure that is very basic and simple to install such that anyone may      have the ability to understand and use it. </PAR><PAR>  A further object of this invention is that it is not limited to being used      for a temporary structure, and can be left in the ground and utilized for      some years, as, for example, a back yard game net (optional). </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The ground anchor pole support of this invention provides a removable,      self-supporting standard for a game net. A pipe, bar or length of tubing      is driven or placed into the ground using a sledgehammer or the like,      thereby forming a ground anchor member. A pole member of comparable shape      is placed over the anchor member to ground level. This standard is      self-supporting, and suitable for supporting a game net for volleyball,      soccer, tennis, badminton, etc. by tightening a net between two such      poles. The concept is to attach a support structure to the earth for use. </PAR><PAR>  Said ground anchor pole support is portable and removable. It can easily be      set up, utilized, and then the entire unit including said ground anchor      member can be removed. Tapping on the anchor member from different sides      will loosen it so it can be easily pulled out of the ground and taken away      to be used elsewhere. </PAR><PAR>  The preferred embodiment of the invention's said anchor portion comprises      of rigid material being of pipe, bar, or tubing. And the adjoining      structure comprises a rigid metal pole member which is sized to slip over      said anchor member that is driven into the ground. A washer of comparable      size may be slipped over said anchor member to serve as a stop at ground      level when the pole member is placed. </PAR><PAR>  The ground anchor members of this invention, described within this      application &quot;net game pole support&quot;, are an important aspect in      consideration over prior art. Said anchor members are designed to      withstand significant lateral forces. For example a game net for      volleyball is fastened to said pole members and are tightened between the      top of said pole members that are spaced approximately 34 feet apart and      are approximately 8 feet above the ground. It is an important aspect that      the net top be very taut with minimal sag. With the said pole members      being of a height of eight feet above the ground, pulling the net tight      creates a great leverage and stress throughout the length of the pole and      where the pole member meets the ground (supported by said ground anchor      member. </PAR><PAR>  When said net is tightened, it is pulled tight by hand exerting      approximately 100 pounds pull. This allows only about 1&quot; of sag across a      34-foot span. The most intricate part and stabilizer of said invention is      the said ground anchor. </PAR><PAR>  The actual length of said ground anchor member is approximately 30 inches.      The distance that this anchor member is driven into the earth will vary on      the density or looseness of the soil. It is of small diameter that it may      be driven into the ground with minimal effort. It is hollow (rather than      using solid bar) for reducing the weight factor making it more portable. </PAR><PAR>  This invention teaches that in place of guy supports to counteract the      force of tightening a game net across from pole member to pole member,      that the said anchor members are set at an angle out away from each other.      Thus the said pole members that are placed over said anchor members are      angled out away from each other. When the top rope or cable of a game net      is tightened between said pole members there is a bow created to where the      top of said pole members flex bringing them in line approxmately to the      bottom of said pole members. A counteracting force pulling away from or in      the opposite direction of the top force that is pulling inward. This      technique described by applicant is unique and unobvious to those of the      industry of portable net game standards in tightening a game net across a      prescribed distance. The counter forces implemented by said pole members      and said anchor members creates a bow lending a constant force pulling      outward, when a game net is tightened between said pole members. This      invention is a respectable improvement in a net game support to the      atheletes who participate in such sports. This apparatus has been designed      and developed to support a game net in a variety of sports that require a      net (volleyball, tennis, soccer, badminton, etc.) whereas a pair of pole      members flex in supporting a net, where net is preferred to be tight      across from pole to pole. This apparatus has been developed to be      self-supporting and not requiring guy supports to obtain and maintain a      tight net between poles. </PAR><PAR>  The primary design of said ground anchor member pole support of this      invention is to achieve a practical way of setting up a net system that is      effective, strong and superior in obtaining a tight net across, thus      providing a safer game by eliminating guy supports. This pole member      support is &quot;self-supporting&quot; even in sand. This invention will enhance and      advance net game sports while creating a safer game environment. </PAR><PAR>  Setting up conventional type (prior art) volleyball systems on the sand      requires a great deal of digging to bury sand anchor member (a disk like      member) for guy wire supports. This type of guy wire support takes time to      install and is inferior to said invention when tightening the net while      setting up for play. Guy wire tightening becomes inferior to this      invention (net game pole support). </PAR><PAR>  Useful and practical accessories for installation of said ground anchor      members include an alignment plate (FIG. 5) that is used to aid in keeping      said anchor member in line vertically and at a prescribe angle as it is      driven into the ground. The alignment plate is then removed by sliding it      up over said anchor member before placement of the said washer and said      pole member. The alignment plate is comprised of a pipe comparable to the      diameter of said pole member to be set at an angle, and is fixed to a base      plate for stability. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, a protector cap (FIG. 4) prevents said anchor member from      being damaged as it is driven or hammered into the earth. The said cap is      placed on top of said anchor member before it is driven into the ground.      This too is removed before placement of said pole member over said anchor      member. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  In order that all the structural features for attaining the object of this      invention may be readily understood, detailed reference is made to the      drawings herein: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is an elevation view of an embodiment of a ground anchor net game      pole support of this invention, illustrating a pole member supporting a      typical game net for volleyball; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is an enlarged side view of the ground anchor pole support of FIG.      1, illustrating the relative arrangement of the ground anchor member, pole      member, and washer; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a side elevation view of a modified ground anchor member      including a solid portion or point; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a side elevation view of a protector cap for the ground anchor      described of this invention; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a side elevation view of an alignment plate for the groudn anchor      described of this invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is an elevation view of an embodiment of a ground anchor pole      support of this invention, illustrating a pole member supporting a typical      volleyball game net. Ground anchor member 10 is placed or driven      approximately two-thirds into the ground, depending on the looseness of      the soil. Washer 15 is place over the anchor member 10, and serves as a      base pad for pole member 20, which is easily placed over the anchor member      and is brought substantially even to the ground level. Thus, the washer      and pole member each have an inside diameter slightly greater than the      outside diameter of said anchor member, and fit over said anchor member.      This standard is self-supporting and requires no additional supports or      guys. </PAR><PAR>  Preferred material for said ground anchor member 10 is one inch schedule 80      pipe or tubing, approximately thirty inches long; for washer 15, a flat      11/4&quot; carbon steel washer; and for said pole member 20, aluminum 11/4&quot;      pipe approximately eight feet long. A typical application for use as a      volleyball net standard would include pipe cap 21, eye bolt 22, hook 23,      net rope or cable 25, stretch cord 25, and net 26. Two poles spaced at a      proper distance will support a game net for a variety of sports. When      tightening a game net across a prescribed distance the poles will bow,      thus said anchor members should be angled out away from each other (as      described infra). </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is an enlarged side view of said ground anchor pole support of FIG.      1, illustrating the relative arrangement of said ground anchor member 10,      pole member 20, and washer 15. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a side elevation view of a modified ground anchor member 10      including a point portion 12 on its bottom end. This design enables easier      driving of the anchor member into rocky soil, with point 12 (made from      solid bar) welded to the anchor member. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a side elevation view of a protector cap 30 for said ground      anchor pole support of this invention. This accessary assures the ability      for repeated use of said ground anchor member. This protector cap is      placed on top of the anchor member to prevent damaging the top end of said      anchor member when driving it into the ground. Cylinder 32 is made of a      short section of pipe comparable in diameter to said pole member to be      placed above ground in order to slip-fit over said anchor member. The      inside diameter is slightly larger than the outside diameter of said      anchor member. Cap 34 is of metal approximately 3/8&quot; thick and is welded      to one end of the cylinder. This protector cap can be placed on said      anchor member and hit with a sledgehammer without bouncing off the said      anchor member it protects. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a side elevation view of said alignment plate 40 for said ground      anchor pole support of this invention. For game net supports, the      alignment plate should be preset with portion No. 42 angled out a few      degrees, depending on the desired height of the game net. The alignment      plate includes a short section of pipe 42, again comparable in diameter to      said pole member, attached to an angle iron 44 or similar component. Lag      screw 46 secures the pipe and angle iron to a base plate 48, which may      surround pipe 42. Thus the angle and alignment of pipe 42 relative to base      48 can be changed by appropriate adjustment. </PAR><PAR>  Obvious improvements of the preferred embodiment for net sports include a      standard fabricated from round or square tubing in carbon steel,      galvanized carbon steel, wood, bamboo, fiberglass, or various alloys of      metal to include aluminum, using the same concept of slip fitting      comparable sizes one over the other, or one inside of the one that is      driven into the ground. </PAR><PAR>  While this invention has been described in connection with preferred      embodiments thereof, it is obvious that modifications and changes therein      may be made by those skilled in the art to which it pertains without      departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the      scope of this invention is to be limited only by the appended claims.
