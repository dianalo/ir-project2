Thereport details performance and durability tests using Fire ResistantDiesel Fuel (FRDF). The objective of the FRDF program is to develop afuture fuel that will reduce the vulnerability of military vehicles tofire, decrease the number of vehicles lost and repair costs, and increasecrew survivability. The objective of this project is to evaluate theperformance and endurance of a medium-sized, unmodified commercial productiondiesel engine of 200-hp range tested with FRDF. The FRDF contains tapwater of 10.2 to 13.2% volume. Another objective of this project is toinspect the fuel-wetted parts of the fuel-injection system and engine,and determine the effect of the water in the fuel on these parts.</TEXT></DOC>
