The policy, which already has sparked protests from industry lawyers, would require the contractors to pledge in new contracts that they didn't improperly obtain information about the Pentagon's decision-making process, or engage in &quot;collusive bidding.&quot; If such a sworn statement later were to turn out to be untrue, the corporate officer who made it could be subject to administrative punishment or even criminal prosecution.    A Navy memorandum spelling out the requirement states that contractors will be required to certify that they relied only on bidding information generally available to the public and &quot;officially made available&quot; by Pentagon contracting officials. If they also relied on other information, they would have to explain what it was and and where it came from.    One alarmed defense-industry lawyer said the new policy &quot;is bound to create monumental headaches for everyone,&quot; and he predicted that many companies will refuse to go along with it. &quot;It is so broad that few companies will agree to sign,&quot; he said.    Pentagon officials say the certification requirement won't cover all military contracts. Explaining the plan in congressional testimony, Defense Undersecretary Robert Costello said the rule will apply only to &quot;contractors whose conduct, as established through official information, warrants enhanced review.&quot; Pentagon staffers explained that the new policy will apply to the contractors implicated in the procurement investigation.    However, lawyers flinch over such certification requirements because it's nearly impossible for industry managers to know exactly what information has been gathered by employees or outside consultants during months of negotiations that typically precede the awarding of contracts for a weapons project.    Pentagon officials said they haven't worked out the exact contractual language for the certifications yet. &quot;The point is to make people at the senior levels {of companies} responsible&quot; for what employees or consultants do to help win defense contracts, one department official explained.    Meanwhile, federal investigators said they uncovered &quot;favoritism&quot; by the former head of the Army's Strategic Defense Command in awarding more than $100 million in defense jobs to BDM International Inc., a large consulting company that had ties to a Navy official and consultants implicated in the current Pentagon procurement scandal.    The latest disclosures aren't related to the current investigation, and neither BDM nor any individuals were accused of criminal wrongdoing as a result of the earlier Army investigation. But information about BDM's work for the Army, disclosed during a House Government Operations subcommittee hearing yesterday, provides new details about the consulting company's close ties to senior military officials.    Officials of the General Accounting Office told lawmakers that Lt. Gen. John Wall, while in charge of the Strategic Defense Command in 1986 and 1987, gave BDM an &quot;apparent advantage over other potential contractors&quot; in obtaining a multiyear research contract. According to GAO testimony, Lt. Gen. Wall invited a senior BDM executive to sit in on a meeting at which Army officials planned their strategy for awarding that contract.    BDM was the only contractor represented at the session. Other participants felt that &quot;was inappropriate&quot; and &quot;gave the meeting a bad appearance,&quot; according to David Williams, head of the GAO's office of special investigations. BDM later submitted the only bid for the work, Mr. Williams told the subcommittee.    In another instance, the GAO official testified, Lt. Gen. Wall directed that certain work be switched to BDM from a management and technical support contract held by another company.    Army criminal investigators, who looked into the general's dealings with BDM as well as other issues, concluded in May that he violated Army regulations, according to the GAO. They never found evidence that he received money or anything of value from BDM, according to a subcommittee aide. The general retired last month after receiving a written reprimand, according to the GAO.    A spokesman for BDM, which Ford Motor Co. recently agreed to acquire for more than $400 million, said the company didn't do anything improper and the research contract was a &quot;completely straightforward procurement.&quot; Army officials told the subcommittee that Lt. Gen. Wall's activities never violated the law. The general couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
