The settlement agreement fell apart after the Air Forcedisclosed earlier this month that Northrop had agreed tospend about $10 million to fix a flaw in the missile'sguidance unit. A fluid used in the guidance unit's gyroscopesmay freeze before reaching the required militaryspecification of minus 65 degrees Fahrenheit, rendering thenavigational gear ineffective, according to recordspreviously obtained by this newspaper.</LP><TEXT>   The disclosure of the Air Force agreement was particularlyirksome to the plaintiffs, since the government had refusedto join their claims that Northrop had knowingly used thedefective fluid when building guidance systems for thenuclear-tipped missiles. The Justice Department did, however,join the whistleblowers in their claims that the companyfalsified test results on the missile components.   In papers filed in federal court here yesterday, HerbertHafif, attorney for the whistleblowers, alleged the existenceof &quot;a continuing government scheme to negotiate a secret sidedeal on the `cold temperature' defect with Northrop.&quot; Mr.Hafif added: &quot;The government apparently concluded they wouldhave to try to settle the {missile} claims by somehow gettingthe whistleblowers to agree to a deceptive settlement.&quot;   The whistleblowers' suit, which originally sought $63million, was brought in federal court here in 1987 under thefederal False Claims Act, and was joined by the JusticeDepartment in early 1989. Before the recent settlement talks,trial was to have begun last month. The civil suit wasparalleled by a criminal investigation and indictment thatled to a settlement last year in which Northrop pleadedguilty to falsifying certain tests on the cruise missile andanother weapons program, and paid $17 million in fines andpenalties.   The U.S. Attorney's office didn't have any immediatecomment on the failed settlement agreement. Northrop ChairmanKent Kresa told shareholders at the annual meeting yesterdaythat the case is &quot;in the process of being settled,&quot; butdeclined to comment on this latest development.   Separately, Mr. Kresa said yesterday that Northrop plansto transfer some scientists and designers from variousprograms in its military aircraft sector to a new AdvancedTechnology and Design organization that will work on futuremilitary aircraft programs. The move follows the company'sbig loss last month in the competition to build the AirForce's next fighter plane.   Northrop also plans to expand its work as a subcontractorfor commercial jet makers, and will separate its commercialaircraft operations into a separate business unit some timeduring the next 12 to 18 months, Mr. Kresa said.</TEXT></DOC>
