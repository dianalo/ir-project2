After a five-day run-up that lifted the market by morethan 5.25%, traders said investors aggressively sold sharesto lock in their recent profits. &quot;It just seems like therewas pretty big profit-taking across the board,&quot; said GeorgeJennison, co-manager of OTC trading at Wheat FirstButcher andamp;Singer.</LP><TEXT>   The Nasdaq Composite Index, which closed Wednesday at anall-time high of 540.94, yesterday slumped 4.67, or 0.86%, to536.27. The index, though, late in the session did rebound bya point from its intraday low.   Among issues that were sunk by earnings news were MCICommunications, which fell 3 to 27 1/8; FHP International,which lost 4 7/8 to 12 3/4, and St. Jude Medical, whichdropped 2 7/8 to 49 7/8. Traders were surprised by the sharpdrops in MCI and St. Jude. Earnings at both companiesincreased from year-earlier levels, and came in just belowexpectations.   Meanwhile, even before the earnings news emerged, themarket already received unsettling news on inflation from theLabor Department. The consumer price index rose 0.4% inSeptember, an increase larger than the 0.2% analysts hadexpected.   Higher inflation could prevent the Federal Reserve Boardfrom taking further steps to lower interest rates. Theprospect for lower rates has provided substantial support forthe stock market in recent months.   Declining issues outpaced advancers by a thin 1,026-to-917margin. National Market System volume was an active180,870,000 shares, below Wednesday's 186,430,000.   On the Big Board, prices remained somewhat more buoyant.The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index closed with aloss of just 0.25, or 0.12%, while the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage lost 8.72, or 0.28%.   But even with yesterday's sell-off, traders said theydon't expect share prices to begin a sustained retreat. &quot;Theywere ripe for some profit-taking, and that's what we got.There still is buying power an I would say that we are notdead yet,&quot; said Robert O'Toole Sr., head of Nasdaqinstitutional sales at Lehman Brothers.   The market could get a boost today from Apple Computer.After the market closed yesterday, Apple reported net incomeof 67 cents a share for its fourth quarter ended Sept. 27,about in line with expectations. A year ago, it earned 81cents. While the stock fell 1 1/8 to 52 3/8 yesterday, afterthe market closed it was a quoted at 54 1/2 in Instinettrading.   Apple sank during regular-session trading after its chiefexecutive officer, John Sculley, said the personal computermaker isn't negotiating a partnership with Sony. AlthoughSony will make some products for Apple in the future, Mr.Sculley said the alliance between the companies won't be asbroad as Apple's recent agreement with International BusinessMachines.   Elsewhere, Amgen lost 5/8 to 62 1/8 ahead of itsthird-quarter earnings report. After the close, it recordednet of 34 cents a share, up from 11 cents last year and justabove analysts' expectations.

MCI Communications fell even though the long-distancetelephone service provider reported third-quarter net of 51cents a share, reversing the 69-cent-a-share loss it had ayear ago.

FHP International sank after the Fountain Valley, Calif.,operator of health maintenance organizations said it expectsto report lower-than-expected first-quarter earnings.

The company said analysts had expected it to earn 28cents to 33 cents in the latest quarter.   St. Jude Medical fell after it reported third-quarter netincome totaled 42 cents a share, up from the 33 cents itearned last year, but below analysts' expectations of about44 cents.

AST Research lost 4 to 28 despite its report that earningsfor the first quarter, ended Sept. 27, rose to 52 cents ashare from 37 cents last year. The results topped the meananalyst estimate of 50 cents, according to First Call.   Market observers tied the decline in AST's stock toconcern about profit margins in the personal computerindustry. Two analysts told Dow Jones Professional InvestorReport that AST had indicated to them that its gross marginsmay fall to a range of 30% to 32% in the second quarter fromthe first quarter's 34.4%. Also, the company yesterday cutprices on some of its notebook PCs by up to 30%.   Dell Computer fell 4 1/8 to 30 7/8, a move that tradersattributed to AST Research's drop.
