<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-78-1114 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors have obtained solid-state 11.7-T {sup 69}Ga and {sup 71}Ganuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of a series of gallosilicates(gallium analogues of zeolites Na-X, Na-Y, Na-sodalite, and Na-natrolite).From the apparent {sup 69}Ga and {sup 71}Ga chemical shifts, values ofthe nuclear quadrupole coupling constants (e{sup 2}qQ/h) and the true,isotropic chemical shifts ({delta}/sub i) have been deduced for the framework,tetrahedral, Ga(OSi){sub 4} sites. The e{sup 2}qQ/h values are in therange 1.9-2.7 MHz for {sup 69}Ga and 1.2-1.7 MHz for {sup 71}Ga. Theisotropic chemical shifts are all in the range 171-186 ppm downfieldfrom an external standard of 1 M Ga(NO{sub 3}){sub 3}. Their resultsindicate that measurement of the apparent (second-order shifted) chemicalshifts for pairs of isotopes of nonintegral spin quadrupolar nuclei insolids at one magnetic field strength is a useful new approach for determinationof both isotropic chemical shifts and nuclear quadrupole coupling constantvalues.</TEXT></DOC>
