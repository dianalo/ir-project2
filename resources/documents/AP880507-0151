(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A money-starved project to studydolphin deaths along the East Coast is receiving a cash infusionfrom the Navy and the National Marine Fisheries Service.   The Office of Naval Research has handed over $50,000 for thedolphin study, and Tom McIntyre of the fisheries service said hisagency soon will chip in another $50,000.   ``The animals are still dying. The Navy felt it was appropriatethat the investigation continue. They did a review of his proposaland it was accepted. We are in the process of moving our money,''McIntyre said Friday.   The beneficiary is a task force headed by Canadian researcherDr. Joseph Geraci, who has anxiously awaited more money since thestudy's funding ran out earlier this year.   Geraci, professor of veterinary medicine in the pathologydepartment at the University of Guelph near Toronto, is a member ofthe U.S. Marine Mammal Commission. The U.S. goverment asked him tohead the research begun last July when hundreds of dead dolphinsbegan washing ashore in New Jersey and Virginia. The deaths spreaddown the coast, reaching Florida in November.   Fisheries service statistics put the official East Coast dolphindeath toll at 742, but the actual number is probably much higherbecause mammals that didn't wash ashore couldn't be counted.   The cause of the deaths is unknown, although scientists believesomething is sapping the dolphins' immune systems, leaving them tolanguish and die from common infections.   The fisheries service fears that as much as 40 percent of theEast Coast's dolphin population has been wiped out.   ``It could take decades to recover,'' said Lesley Scheele, adolphin project coordinator for the environmental group Greenpeace.</TEXT></DOC>
