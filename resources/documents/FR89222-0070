This information pertains to the sampledMedicare beneficiaries living in institutions, in their communities, ordeceased at the time of the follow-up.The records include information on personal care; mobility; physical, mental,and social functioning; formal and informal supportive services; incomeand assets; performance of such activities as managing money and takingmedicine; basic information on nursing home stays, living arrangements,and date of death; plus basic demographic information on beneficiarieswith no functional limitations. The survey data for individual beneficiariesin the sample can be merged with Medicare utilization records. The noticefor this system of records was most recently published at 49 FR 2961 (January24, 1984).We are proposing to add the following routine use to the systems noticeto permit disclosure of the records.To an individual or organization for a research, demonstration, evaluation,or epidemiologic project related to the prevention of disease or disability,or the restoration or maintenance of health if HCFA:a. Determines that the use or disclosure does not violate legal limitationsunder which the record was provided, collected, or obtained;b. Determines that the purpose for which the disclosure is to be made:(1) Cannot be reasonably accomplished unless the record is provided inan individually identifiable form; and (2) Is of sufficient importance to warrant the effect and/or risk on theprivacy of the individual that additional exposure of the record mightbring; and(3) There is reasonable probability that the objective for the use wouldbe accomplished.c. Requires the information recipient to:(1) Establish reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguardsto prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the record, and (2) Remove or destroy the information that allows the individual to beidentified at the earliest time at which removal or destruction can beaccomplished consistent with the purpose of the project, unless the recipientpresents an adequate justification of a research or health nature for retaiingsuch information, and (3) Make no further use or disclosure of the record except:(a) In emergency circumstances affecting the health or safety of any individual;or(b) For use in another research project, under these same conditions, andwith written authorization of HCFA; or(c) For disclosure to a properly identified person for the purpose of anaudit related to the research project, if information that would enableresearch subjects to be identified is removed or destroyed at the earliestopportunity consistent with the purpose of the audit; or(d) When required by law.d. Secures a written statement attesting to the information recipient'sunderstanding of and willingness to abide by these provisions.HHS and HCFA have an important stake in the development of more informationabout persons in actual or potential need of long-term care services; aboutwhether needed services are health care services or supportive servicesto forestall premature placement in nursing homes. The importance of thisundertaking to HHS is exemplified by its Long-Term Care Initiative. Aspart of this initiative, HHS has sponsored several major surveys and studiesrelated to the long-term care population. These include: The National Long-TermSurveys of 1982 and 1984, the 1984 and 1986 Supplements on Aging of theHealth Interview Survey, the 1985 National Nursing Home Survey, the NationalLong-Term Care Channeling Demonstration, and the Institutionalized PopulationComponent of the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey. HHS has puta strong emphasis on making the data collected in these surveys availableto the researchers. As part of this effort, DHHS sponsored the NationalInvitational Conference on Long-Term Care Data Bases on May 21-22, 1987.Invitees included some of the best-known names in the field of long-termcare research, as well as representatives from organizations with directand indirect stake in increased knowledge about long-term care issues,such as insurance companies, benefits planning agencies, and universities.HCFA's stake in improving the flow of information concerning that portionof the Medicare aged beneficiary population in actual or potential needof long-term care services arises from its administrative responsibilityfor the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Extended payments for long-termcare services, particulary for nursing home care, is the most common reasonaged persons become eligible to receive public assistance from Medicaid.This process, known as ``spend down'' occurs after the individual has spentsavings and used other assets to meet the costs of these services. Greaterunderstanding of the circumstances preceding and accompanying this processwill permit more effective planning. This will lead to the developmentof improved ways of meeting long-term care expenses, such as private insuranceplans, and to the development of cost-effective alternatives to institutionalplacement.This proposed modification of the systems notice will augment HHS and HCFAaccess to information and improve the planning and administration of programson behalf of aged Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in actual or potentialneed of long-term care services.The new routine use is consistent with the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(7),since, as previously noted, it is compatible with the purpose for whichthe information is collected. Because the addition of this new routineuse will not change the purposes for which the information is to be usedor otherwise significantly alter the system, we are not preparing a reportof altered system of records under 5 U.S.C. 552a(o). This routine use isalready included in the systems notices of all of HCFA's major data systems.The entire systems notice is published below. Please note that since thisnotice was last published in its entirety, the data collected in the follow-uphas been merged with the data collected in the original survey of 1982to provide an integrated data base. This file, with individual identifiersremoved, has also been produced as a public use tape available from theNational Technical Information Serice.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: February 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William L.
