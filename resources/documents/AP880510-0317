The plumbing and air-conditioning manufacturer said itsfirst-quarter net income slipped to $21.3 million from $21.6million in the first three months of 1987. Per-share income rose,on the other hand, to 67 cents from 65 cents as the number ofoutstanding American Standard shares declined to around 31.5million from 32.9 million in the same period a year ago.   The decline in net income occurred despite a 15.5 percent jumpin first-quarter revenue, to $900.8 million from $779.7 million ayear earlier.   The company said it spent $30 million in investment banking,legal and other fees fighting off the bid from Towson, Md.-basedBlack andamp; Decker.
