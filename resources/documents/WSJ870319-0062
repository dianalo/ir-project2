The decision comes the week after the Senate Banking Committee cleared legislation that includes a one-year ban on federal and state regulators granting banks any additional powers. Yesterday's action indicates that the Fed may be willing to decide pending applications while the measure is before Congress.    The Fed had said it would decide by April applications by Bankers Trust New York Corp., Citicorp and J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. to underwrite commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities, municipal revenue bonds and consumer-related receivables. Approval of those applications would greatly widen cracks in the half-century-old legal barrier separating commercial and investment banking.    Yesterday's decision allows Chase Commercial Corp., an Englewood, N.J.-based subsidiary of Chase Manhattan, to underwrite and trade in commercial paper as a principal, purchasing commercial paper for its own account for later resale. The Fed's previous decision involving commercial paper power -- allowing Bankers Trust to place paper through a commercial lending subsidiary -- didn't involve underwriting authority.    Like the Bankers Trust decision, though, the Chase Manhattan decision also directs that Chase Commercial's gross revenue from its commercial paper activities can't exceed 5% of its total gross revenue and that its share of the total commercial paper market can't exceed 5%.    Those restrictions are aimed at circumventing a provision in federal banking law that bars banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System from affiliating with any firm that is &quot;engaged principally&quot; in underwriting and dealing securities.    A Chase spokesman in New York termed the Fed's decision &quot;extremely significant&quot; because &quot;it means expanded powers for banks that will lead to increased competition benefiting our customers&quot; and &quot;makes for a sounder banking system by allowing banks to diversify their activities.&quot; He also said the action &quot;signals the Fed's strong belief that change is essential if bank holding companies are to continue to have a vital role in the financial services industry.&quot;    The Fed's decision mentions the pending Senate legislation that would ban new powers retroactive to March 6 and extending for one year after the bill becomes law. The Fed, though, noting that the bill isn't yet law, states that &quot;the Board believes it must proceed to reach a decision on this application.&quot; The Fed warned Chase that if the ban on new powers is enacted, the bank holding company &quot;may be required . . . to cease its commercial paper underwriting activities.&quot;    Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) wants the ban in order to give lawmakers time to study whether banks should be given more powers. His original bill gave bank holding companies new securities powers, but he backed down after Democrats on the committee said they weren't ready to decide the issue.    The legislation is awaiting consideration by the full Senate. </TEXT></DOC>
