(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Television evangelist Jim Bakker's effortsto rebuild his ministry will be centered in a nearly desertedshopping center where he has moved his headquarters.   Bakker and his wife, Tammy, broadcast their show live Mondayfrom their new studio in a boarded-up department store. During theshow, Bakker stepped over shards of glass and wire hung looseoverhead.   Outside, a protester carried a sign that read ``Just Say No.Keep Our City Clean'' and said he didn't want the Bakkers inOrlando.   ``I think it's so wrong,'' said Frankie Skinner, 23, of Orlando.``They shouldn't get another chance.''   Local officials raised another possible objection Monday,announcing that the Bakkers had not applied for an occupationallicense to operate their headquarters from the shopping center, andordering building inspectors to visit the shopping center today.   Yet Bakker said before the program that he was satisfied withthe move to the Shoppers World mall, which is located outsideOrlando.   ``Orlando seems like it's the crossroads of the world,'' Bakkertold reporters. ``The thing I like about it is, it's a place whereit seems like everyone is welcome.''   The only other tenants at the 90,000-square-foot strip mall area Far East import store and two bars, including Nasty Ed's Pub,where the clientele squinted through windows to see their newneighbors.   The Bakkers came to Florida after running into zoning problemswhile taping their program at a rented home near Charlotte, N.C.   Bakker, 49, is awaiting a federal trial on 24 counts of fraudand conspiracy. The former head of the PTL television ministry ischarged with stealing millions of dollars from the organization hefounded.   Bakker was ousted in 1987 following revelations that he had asexual tryst with church secretary Jessica Hahn and paid her withministry money to keep quiet.</TEXT></DOC>
