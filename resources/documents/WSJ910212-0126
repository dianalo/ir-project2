A spokesman said the service generated &quot;several milliondollars a year in losses,&quot; and the company decided &quot;itdoesn't make sense&quot; to keep operating it, especially whenNynex faces economic pressures from the recession in theNortheast. The spokesman declined to disclose the exactamount of the gateway losses.</LP><TEXT>   Nynex, based in White Plains, N.Y., said that since itstarted the gateway service in Vermont in 1988 and laterexpanded it to the New York City area and Boston, only about12,000 customers used the service. The company said it wasasking state regulators in New York and New England forpermission to close the gateway May 10. The Nynex spokesmansaid it might be reopened if judicial, economic andregulatory conditions improve.   Nynex said it couldn't continue to operate the gatewaygiven restrictions imposed under the consent decree thatbroke up the Bell System in 1984. Among other things, Nynexsaid it couldn't provide, or control, the quality ofservices, and couldn't require service providers to usestandard commands and directions to ease customers' use.   In recent years, many other companies have bailed out ofthe so-called videotex business, citing a lack of demand anddifficulties attracting a wide variety of informationservices. Even Prodigy, the Sears Roebuck andamp; Co.-InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. joint venture, which isn't burdenedby regulatory and consent decree restrictions imposed on theBell companies, has yet to turn a profit.   The decision may hurt Nynex and the other Bells as theypush for greater freedom from Congress, and from Judge HaroldGreene, who oversees the consent decree, and from Congress.That's because the companies generally haven't done much todevelop gateways since Judge Greene gave them permission todo so in 1988. Judge Greene is expected to rule, possibly byJune, on whether to grant the Bells greater freedom to offerinformation services.   Like an entrance to a shopping mall, a gateway allows aconsumer to obtain services of many different informationproviders. Two of the Bells, Ameritech and Pacific TelesisGroup, decided early on that the market for informationservices wasn't developed sufficiently to give gateways atry. Southwestern Bell Corp. dropped out of the market lastyear. BellSouth Corp. and Bell Atlantic Inc. have relativelysmall gateway trials. Only U S West Inc. continues todistribute simple terminals for customers to connect toinformation services.   For the most part, the Bells have blamed Judge Greene forbarring them from owning information services provided overthe gateways, and from providing the service acrosslong-distance boundaries.</TEXT></DOC>
