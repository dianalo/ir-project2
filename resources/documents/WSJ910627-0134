Though spending could initially rise under the plan byfour to five billion European currency units ($4.4 billion to$5.7 billion), sources said, the eventual impact of thechanges would be to save the EC money and encourage more freeglobal trade in farm products.</LP><TEXT>   Ray MacSharry, the EC's farm commissioner, outlined thestill-confidential farm reform proposals yesterday to otherEC commissioners, who are expected to adopt the plan nextmonth. The proposals would mean sharp cuts in guaranteedprices paid to farmers, especially to grain farmers, sourcessaid. Beef and dairy farmers also would see sharp cuts.   The plans are certain to provoke controversy among ECministers, who will be asked to adopt them this autumn.Changes in farm spending typically elicit strong protestsamong farmers and such countries as France, which has a largeand powerful farming population. EC officials refused todiscuss the proposals in detail.   Trading partners such as the U.S. and Australia hope thechange in the EC farm policies will be adopted and will givea boost to stalled world trade negotiations under the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade. The EC hopes that its planwill be seen as evidence that it is serious about cuttingsubsidies that distort competition. Currently, EC priceguarantees encourage uneconomical production while exportsubsidies allow the excess to be dumped at unfair prices onworld markets.   EC refusal to agree to make such changes in its farmprograms was a major reason GATT talks failed in December.Those talks cover all areas of world trade. GATT officials,trying to revive the talks, say EC agricultural reform is thekey.   The U.S. has long called for a &quot;decoupling&quot; of EC supportmeasures from output. Officials indicated Washington wouldn'tworry about a rise in EC farm spending, but would be pleasedto see cuts in subsidies that distort world markets.   The higher EC farm spending would result from a packageproposed by Mr. MacSharry to compensate farmers, especiallythose with smaller holdings, for the big price cuts. ECofficials contended the rise would be short term. Once thesteps aimed at discouraging overproduction yielded results,spending on export subsidies and food storage would plunge,they said.   Some of the increased spending would be necessary to helpolder farmers retire early and to encourage others to leavesome land unplanted. The smallest farms, however, wouldn't beforced to take land out of production.   The EC is expected to spend 32 billion ECUs on its CommonAgricultural Policy this year, with almost a third going forexport subsidies that bridge the gap between high EC pricesand low world prices.   Under the plan, prices would be cut as much as 35% forcereals and 18% for beef, sources said.   While Mr. MacSharry has promised to compensate mostfarmers for the price cuts, it wasn't clear whether this willgo far enough to satisfy Britain, the Netherlands andDenmark, which fiercely oppose measures that favor smallfarmers at the expense of big, efficient producers.</TEXT></DOC>
