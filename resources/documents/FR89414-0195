Program Purpose Section 3501 of Pub. L. 100-690, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, establishedthe Drug Education and Prevention Program Relating to Youth Gangs. Thespecific purposes of the Program are to: 1. Prevent and reduce the participation of youth in the activities of gangsthat engage in illicit drug-related activities; 2. Promote the involvement of youth in lawful activities in communitiesin which such gangs commit drug-related crimes; 3. Prevent the abuse of drugs by youth, educate youth about such abuse,and refer for treatment and rehabilitation members of such gangs who abusedrugs;4. Support activities of local police departments and other law enforcementagencies related to the conduct of educational outreach activities in communitiesin which gangs commit drug-related crimes; 5. Inform gang members and their families about the availability of treatmentand rehabilitation services for drug abuse; 6. Facilitate Federal and State cooperation with local school officialsto assist youth who are likely to participate in gangs that commit drug-relatedcrimes; and 7. Facilitate coordination and cooperation among local education, juvenilejustice, employment, and social services agencies, and drug abuse referral,treatment and rehabilitation programs for the purpose of preventing orreducing the participation of youth in activities of gangs that commitdrug-related crimes. The overall purpose of the ACYF discretionary Youth Gang Drug PreventionProgram is to assist communities in controlling the spread of gang anddrug-related activities through the prevention, early intervention, anddiversion of at-risk youth from gang membership, and through the supportof activities designed to achieve the purposes of section 3501 of the Act.All applicants under this program announcement must describe in detailhow the activities proposed will address these specific purposes. B.

(2) <T3>Drug </T3>means a beverage containing alcohol; a controlled substance;or a controlled substance analogue.(3) <T3>Illicit </T3>means unlawful or injurious.(4) <T3>Public agency </T3>means any State, unit of local government, combinationof such States or units, or any agency, department, or instrumentalityof any of the foregoing.(5) <T3>State </T3>any State of the United States, the District of Columbia,the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands,the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the NorthernMariana Islands. C. Background  Recent studies by the University of Chicago and others report the existenceof youth gangs in every State. The prevalence of gangs and associated illicitdrug-related activity is widespread. It is estimated that 300 cities (i.e.,13 percent of all U.S. cities with 10,000 or more inhabitants) are experiencingproblems with youth gangs. While smaller cities and suburban areas areexperiencing an increase in youth gang activity, the strongest presenceis in major population centers (i.e., 83 percent of the largest citiesand 27 percent of the cities with 100,000 inhabitants are experiencingthe most severe problems). Associated with the recent increase in youth gang formation is the apparentincrease in youth gang violence and involvement in the use and sale ofdrugs. Definitive national data are not available; however, it is evidentthat, in the mid-1980's, extensive drug use and sale by gang members ison the increase in cities both large and small. Moreover, police and juvenilejustice reports indicate a shift from traditional turf-related gang violenceto that associated with the use and sale of illicit drugs. Gang membersfrom large urban areas identify with the interstate drug traffic. Evidencealso suggests a franchising effort on the part of long-standing traditionalgangs to smaller communities around the country. In many areas this activityhas led to the emergence of new youth gangs and associated criminal activityamong these youth. Youth involvement in gangs has gone beyond the traditional reasons of acceptance,protection, and status to include an economic incentive. Experts in thefield agree that little is known or understood about gang formation orabout effective measures to combat their anti-social behavior. However,it is accepted that concerted and comprehensive efforts are needed at thecommunity and grassroots levels to prevent and reduce the further recruitmentand involvement of at-risk youth in gangs. Projects funded under this announcementwill support a non-punitive, human service oriented, community responseto this problem. This program announcement focuses on discretionary financial support forprojects which address the problems associated with both the more traditionaland the newer, emerging types of gangs. Emphasis is also placed on thecoordination of city, county, and State services and systems with thoseof community-based organizations. This coordination should result in concentratedand sustained efforts in specific geographic areas which include the participationof most, if not all, of the systems and services listed under Purpose andplusmin;7of the Program (see Part I, section A).The anticipated benefits from the combination of public and private non-profitagenciesand services will be the establishment of new, improved or expanded servicesor methods of service delivery. For example, innovative cooperation andinformation sharing between law enforcement and community-based agenciescould produce an early intervention system that effectively involves out-of-schooladolescents, their families, and other supports in alternative activitiesfor youth to find acceptance and support in that neighborhood. In addition, the role of employers and businesses, particularly those whichoperate within communities experiencing gang problems, as full partnersin the proposed activities cannot be overstated. Past experience with programsto increase the self-sufficiency of at-risk youth has proven the need forstrong participation by the business sector. This is true not simply forthe provision of employment, which in itself is a primary alternative tocriminal activity, but also for the leadership and investment that involvedemployers and businesses can provide in the institutionalization of theseactivities. The Federal government is currently supporting numerous activities to preventsubstance abuse and delinquency among at-risk youth. The Office of SubstanceAbuse Prevention (OSAP), Department of Health and Human Services, and theOffice of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), Departmentof Justice, are sources of information for such activities at the communitylevel. In order to reduce potential duplication, HDS encourages applicantsto coordinate their proposed activities with projects in their communitieswhich are supported by these organizations. This collaboration is particularlyencouraged in activities to address Purposes andplusmin;3 and andplusmin;5of the Program (see Part I, Section A).

Eligibility Any public or non-profit private agency, organization (including communitybased organizations with demonstrated experience in this field), institutionor other non-profit entity (including individuals) is eligible to apply.Non-profit applicants who have not previously received support from theOffice of Human Development Services must submit proof of non-profit statuswith their grant application. This can be done either by making referenceto its listing in the Internal Revenue Service's (lRS) most recent listof tax-exempt organizations or by submitting a copy of its letter fromIRS [IRS Code sections 501(C)(3) and 501(C)(6)]. Non-profit applicantscannot be funded without acceptable proof of this status. Although <T3>for</T3>-profit entities do not qualify as applicants under this grantannouncement, they may participate as contractors under grants to eligiblenon-profit applicants. As required by section 3503 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, priority will begiven to applicants from geographic areas in which frequent and severedrug-related crimes are committed by gangs and law-breaking groups whosemembership is composed primarily of youth, and to applicants who demonstratebroad support of community-based organizations in such geographic areas.We realize that attempting to obtain definitive data regarding the geographicdistribution of youth gang activities is a difficult issue. In order tocarry out the mandate of section 3503 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, we willconsult with the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention,which can provide the best source of information at the present time. Wewill also consider the detailed discussion of emerging or current youthgang problems that should be provided by the applicant in the ``Objectivesand Need'' section of the program narrative (see Part III, section A).All applicants must demonstrate a willingness to cooperate with a thirdparty evaluation contractor to be funded by the Administration for Children,Youth and Families (ACYF) which will conduct assessments of their programand service delivery models. Such cooperation will involve periodicallyfurnishing needed financial, service provision, and process-oriented dataas required by the evaluation contractor and allowing the contractor reasonableaccess to obtain youth and family impact information. All data collectedby participating programs and by the contractor will be kept confidentialand restricted to the stated purposes of the program. As a condition of any grant awarded under this announcement, each applicantmust certify compliance with the application requirements of section 3502(b)of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act by signing the assurance form included in theapplication package (see Appendix II). E. Applicant Share of Project Costs Applicants must contribute at least 25 percent ($1 for every $3 of Federalfunding) of the total cost of the project. For example: an applicant whoapplies for $150,000 in Federal funding must provide $50,000 toward theproject, with a total project cost of $200,000. The applicant share ofproject costs may be made in either cash or third party in-kind contributions,secured from non-Federal sources. ACYF encourages applicants to proposegrantee shares which will be met in cash, as opposed to in-kind, contributions.The Federal share of project costs are specified in the respective priorityarea descriptions in Part II of this announcement. <ITAG tagnum="85">Part II: Priority Area Descriptions and Minimum Requirements for ProjectDesign </ITAG>A. Establishment of Community-Based Consortia for AddressingIssues Relating to Youth Who Are Members of, or At-Risk of Becoming Membersof, Gangs Involved in Illicit Drug Use <T3>Purpose: </T3>Increased efforts are needed at the community level tofocus concentrated attention on, and to develop comprehensive and coordinatedapproaches to, the current and emerging problems of youth gangs and theirinvolvement with illicit drugs. Broad-based partnerships which draw uponthe resources, expertise, energies, commitment and ideas of many differentgroups and individuals are needed to undertake concerted efforts at thecommunity level to prevent and divert children and youth from becomingmembers of these gangs and to intervene in the lives of youth who are alreadyinvolved. The ages of this target population may range from 4 to 18 years.However, greater emphasis should be placed on prevention and early interventionwith junior hign school youth, ages 11 through 14. Approximately 10 to 40 grants will be awarded under this priority areato support the development of community-based consortia which will spearheadthe conduct of innovative, comprehensive approaches to this problem throughthe implementation of projects and activities in support of the purposesidentified in Section 3501 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (see PartI, Section A). There are no limitations on the number of different consortiathat may submit an application within a single geographic area. Under this priority area, the applicant, in addition to being a fully participatingmember of a community-based consortium, must demonstrate the capacity toassume leadership responsibility for coordinating the activities of anddisbursing funds to the other members. For this purpose, a community-basedconsortium is defined as a formal partnership among at least three city,county, town, neighborhood, or other local level organizations and/or individualsthat have the capacity to generate sustained, collaborative community-widecommitment and support for strategies which address the issues of youthgangs. Membership in these consortia should represent community-based organizationsand local social service, employment, school and juvenile justice agencies.Where it is not possible to include local social service, employment, schooland/or juvenile justice agencies in the consortium membership, the applicantmust at least establish a mechanism to promote coordination and dialoguewith these agencies. Depending upon the type of activities to be carriedout, the organizations represented by the consortium may include, but arenot limited to, the following types of public and private sector organizations:voluntary agencies, law enforcement agencies, local government agencies,recreational agencies, youth organizations, businesses, churches, foundations,medical facilities, and colleges. The types of initiatives to be funded under this priority area will vary,depending on the size, demographic make-up, and need of each community.All applications, however, should focus attention on new ways of approachingthis problem and innovative partnerships that can be established to promoteand support community ownership of and involvement in reducing the presenceof gangs in their neighborhood. For example: andbullet; Organizing creative alternatives to youth gang activities; andbullet; Linking current and potential youth gang members with conventionaltypes of organizations or activities within the community; andbullet; Involving former gang members in consortium activities; andbullet; Increasing or improving direct services to this target populationby designing new methods for breaking down barriers to cross-cutting servicedelivery systems, including new and innovative involvement of law enforcementagencies; andbullet; Providing special opportunities to encourage at-risk youth toremain in school and dropouts to return to the school setting; andbullet; Providing cross-cutting training and skill development opportunitiesto juvenile justice, education, employment and social service personnel;andbullet; Employing comprehensive case management approaches to dealingwith families and youth who are at risk of gang involvement; andbullet; Diverting young or first time juvenile offenders from detention/incarcerationexperiences to community restitution and/or diversion programs and activities;andbullet; Involving and empowering all youth, parents, families and individualsin community activities designed to change the environmental factors whichpromote youth gang involvement; and andbullet; Involving non-traditional groups and approaches to work with youth,families and communities.<T3>Duration of Project: </T3>Not to exceed 24 months, with second yearcontinuation dependent upon availability of funds and satisfactory performanceby the grantee. <T3>Federal Share of Project Costs: </T3>Total Federal funding for anyconsortium may range from $250,000 to $1,000,000 per year depending onthe size of the geographic area, target population, and level of effort.Up to 10 percent of the funds may be designated by the applicant for coordinationof consortium activities. <T3>Minimum Requirements for Project Design: </T3>All eligible applicationswill be reviewed, evaluated and competitively scored against the criteriaoutlined in Part III of this announcement.

Because the purposes identifiedin the Act are closely related, it is recognized that applicants may undertakeactivities that will impact more than one purpose. However, for this particularpriority area, the seven purposes identified in the Act will be consideredas separate and distinct sub-categories. Each application submitted underthis priority area must identify the primary purpose (or sub-category)that will be addressed, and under which the applicant will compete forfunding with other applicants who have identified the same primary purpose.All aspects of the primary purpose and any related purpose(s) that theapplicant proposes to address must be fully developed within the application,since the review criteria (see Part III of this announcement) will be appliedto the entire proposal. These activities may be community-based, State-wide, or national in scope.The ages of the children and youth targeted by this priority area may rangefrom 4 to 18 years. However, prevention and diversion efforts should particularlyfocus on junior high school youth, ages 11 through 14, who are most immediatelyat risk of recruitment into gangs. Although coordination among serviceand support providers is always encouraged, applicants are not requiredto establish formal partnerships with other organizations in order to successfullycompete under this priority area.In carrying out the purposes identified in section 3501 of the Anti-DrugAbuse Act, emphasis may be placed on developing and implementing pilotprograms or on expanding or improving current programs in these areas.Components of the selected activity may include, but are not limited to,one or more of the following: peer counseling, family education, youthempowerment, mentorships, crisis intervention, community restitution projects,alternative recreational, educational, and/or employment opportunitiesfor youth at risk of gang involvement, and ethnic/cultural considerations.<T3>Duration of Project: </T3>Not to exceed a 17-month project period,with the possibility of a non-competing continuation of 12 months, basedon availability of funds and satisfactory performance by the grantee. <T3>Federal Share of Project Costs: </T3>Up to $150,000 for the initialproject period. <T3>Minimum Requirements for Project Design: </T3>All eligible applicationswill be reviewed, evaluated and competitively scored against the criteriaoutlined in Part III of this announcement.

Innovative Support Programs for At-Risk Youth and Their Families inCommunities With High Incidence of Gangs Involved in Illicit Drug Use <T3>Purpose: </T3>Five to ten grants will be awarded under this priorityarea to encourage the development and implementation of model projectswhich examine the role of the family in youth gang early intervention/preventionactivities. Grants will be awarded for activities which focus on familyeducation, empowerment, and involvement strategies in support of the purposesidentified in section 3501 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (see PartI, section A). The ages of the children and youth targeted by this priorityarea range from birth to early adolescence, particularly junior high schoolyouth, ages 11 through 14.In developing these family support projects, applicants are encouragedto consider collaborative efforts with agencies and individuals currentlyproviding support services to at-risk families, e.g., Head Start and childdevelopment programs, school systems, child abuse and neglect programs,family violence programs, surrogate parenting programs. Components of these family support projects may focus on issues such asfamily substance abuse, reliance of the family on youth drug-related income,child care practices (especially latch key children), different types offamily structures, family rituals, ethnic/cultural differences, lack offamily communication, barriers to fulfillment of parental roles, familiesin crisis, parental education and skill development, and impact of siblingor other family member involvement in gang activities. A particular focus of this priority area is female gang membership. Observationsby researchers and service providers indicate that girls are at risk ofmore severe and life long negative impact than are boys. In traditionalgangs, it is not uncommon to find a female member whose mother was herselfa member of the same gang. Family dysfunction and community alienationmay be causal factors. Support will be given to projects which identifyand work with these youth and their families to prevent and divert girlsfrom gang involvement and interrupt the cycle of gang participation. <T3>Duration of Project: </T3>Not to exceed a 17-month project period,with the possibility of a non-competing continuation of 12 months, basedon availability of funds and satisfactory performance by the grantee. <T3>Federal Share of Project Costs: </T3>Up to $200,000 for the initialproject period. <T3>Minimum Requirements for Project Design: </T3>All eligible applicationswill be reviewed, evaluated and competitively scored against the criteriaoutlined in Part III of this announcement.

Otherwise, applicants should contact their SPOC as soon as possible toalert them of the prospective application and receive any necessary instructions.Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOC as early as possibleso that the program office can obtain and review SPOC comments as partof the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all requiredmaterials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal(or date of contact if no submittal is required) on the SF 424, Block 16a.OHDS will notify the State of any applicant who fails to indicate SPOCcontact (when required) on the application form.
