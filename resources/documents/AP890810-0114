The Cabinet will ``ensure a balance of voices from the people,''he said. ``There are both political reform and tax reform, and Iplan to do both reliably.''   After the ceremony, the ministers held their first meeting.   Kaifu, 58, was elected prime minister Wednesday after twopredecessors were forced out of office in the last 10 weeks.   Naboru Takeshita quit to take responsibility for aninfluence-peddling scandal. Sousuke Uno resigned after the LiberalDemocrats suffered a major loss in elections for Parliament's upperhouse.   ``What is important above all is political ethics,'' Kaifu said.``Without faith in us, we will collapse.''   News reports said Kaifu planned to visit Washington from Sept.3-9 and discuss with President Bush moves to ease trade frictionbetween the two countries.   A major issue for Kaifu is how to respond to continuing U.S.demands for greater access to Japan's markets. Opposition fromfarmers to a wider opening of Japan's market to agriculturalimports was seen as factor in the Liberal Democrats' loss in theupper house elections last month.   The new foreign minister, Taro Nakayama, said a U.S. visit hadnot been decided upon.   Hikaru Matsunaga, the new international trade minister, saidJapan must increase its imports while maintaining a balance betweeneconomic growth led by domestic demand and protection of theenvironment.   Finance Minister Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto ruled out repealingthe widely opposed 3 percent sales tax that took effect in April.   A repeal move is likely to be launched in Parliament's upperhouse, where the Liberal Democrats lost their majority in the July23 election.   Kaifu has pledged to review the tax, reportedly planning to userevenues it generates toward welfare purposes.   Women were particularly vocal in criticism of the new tax. Inaddition, they were incensed over reports that Uno kept paidmistresses.   The women's vote was seen as one of the reasons for the LiberalDemocratic loss in July.   The new Cabinet includes women for the first time _ SumikoTakahara, a non-politician and economic expert who is head of theEconomic Planning Agency, and lawmaker Mayumi Moriyama, director ofthe Environment Agency.   ``By listening to the voice of the people, I hope to reduce thegap between the people'' and the government, Kaifu said.   ``For that reason I chose people from outside government,'' hesaid. ``And to ensure a balance of voices from the people, Ihighlighted the appointment of women.''</TEXT></DOC>
