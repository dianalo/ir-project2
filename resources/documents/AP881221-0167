Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy andCommerce Committee, asked RJR Nabisco President F. Ross Johnson andnine members of the company's board of directors to supply documentsand submit to interviews.   A management group headed by Johnson lost out to the investmentfirm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., which bid a record $24.5 billionfor RJR Nabisco, a diversified food and tobacco products firm.   Dingell, in letters dated Wednesday, asked for voluntarycooperation with the investigation into the leveraged buyout, orLBO, but said his oversight and investigations subcommittee couldissue subpoenas.   The subcommittee ``is conducting an investigation into theapplication and adequacy of the federal securities laws inconnection with the recent offers to purchase RJR Nabisco Inc.,''Dingell wrote.   He asked for information ``pertaining to any discussion,consideration or analysis regarding a possible or actual offer''from Johnson and RJR Nabisco management and ``regarding otheralternatives for raising the value or market price of the company'sstock.''   He asked for copies of documents by Jan. 13 and requested thatthe executives travel to Washington to be interviewed bycongressional aides by Feb. 3.   Dennis Fitzgibbons, a spokesman for Dingell, declined to discussthe subcommittee's reasons for examining the transaction, but saidDingell ``has been concerned with LBOs for quite some time. This ispart of an effort to find out what is going on, not just with RJRNabisco, but with LBOs in general and what, if anything, Congresscan or should do about it.''   In a leveraged buyout, an investment group borrows heavily inorder to buy out stockholders and take over the company. Oftenleveraged buyouts are proposed by managers seeking to thwart ahostile takeover from another firm.   The company's new owners either cut costs or sell off pieces ofthe company to pay back the loans. Critics of the practice fear thehigh debt levels, in an economic downturn, would endanger both thecompany and the banks and investment firms making the loans. Theyalso say the transactions are unfair because they dilute thepotential claims of existing bondholders.   Meanwhile, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman David S.Ruder, in a letter to the Energy and Commerce finance subcommittee,chaired by Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said the SEC has begun``a broad fact gathering effort ... including a study of some of thelargest leveraged buyouts of recent years.''   ``In particular, the staff will focus on the exposure ofbroker-dealers and investment banking firms providing bridgefinancing in leveraged acquisitions,'' he said.   The agency also will examine the adequacy of its disclosurerules, designed to warn existing bondholders and other investors ofany risks in LBOs.   Ruder is scheduled to testify regarding LBOs to Markey'ssubcommittee on Thursday.</TEXT></DOC>
