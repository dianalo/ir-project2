Lawlessness persisted a week afterGen. Saw Maung seized power and moved to crush dissent.   Radio Rangoon said five people were wounded and 16 arrested infive lootings in Rangoon and that two mobs violated the 8 p.m.-4a.m. curfew imposed by the new military regime. The looters wereafter rice, gasoline and corrugated iron sheets, it said.   The bloodiest incident occurred when security forces shot sevenpeople to death while halting a crowd of 100 looters Sunday nightat the state-owned Five Star Shipping Line near Rangoon River, theradio said.   It said two others were killed when security forces dispersed amob of 1,000 people looting a government rice warehouse, and threedied while looting of another government warehouse.   The government says security forces have killed more than 250civilians, mostly people described as looters, since the Sept. 18coup. Western diplomats believe more have died, including manyunarmed demonstrators who marched to demand democracy after 26years of authoritarian rule.   Security officials in Thailand said Sunday that Burmese studentleaders have been fleeing across the border almost daily after themilitary crackdown drove them underground.   Pinit Sunantha, a Border Patrol Police official in northern Takprovince of Thailand, said student leaders have been crossing intoThailand almost daily, but did not provide an exact figure.   A group of 62 students, teachers and villagers crossed thenarrow Moei River into Tak on Friday, some swimming and othersriding in long boats, Pinit said.   On Saturday, a spokesman for Burma's strongest ethnic rebelgroup said about 90 student protesters fled to his group's borderbase camps, where they may get military training. The spokesman forthe Karen National Union said about 200 more students were on theirway to the bases.   A woman who identified herself as from the All Burma StudentsUnion telephoned The Associated Press bureau Sunday in Rangoon towarn students not to proceed to the border area because of thedanger.   ``Their security condition is extremely grave. Please try tostop them immediately,'' she said before hanging up.   Diplomats believe the military apparently established effectivecontrol of the country after the coup, ending street marches andbreaking up protest centers in dozens of towns nationwide.   Rangoon residents have ventured out of their homes only to shop,and a state-owned newspaper announced strict rules from the RoadTransport Board requiring pedestrians to walk facing traffic and insingle file along the side of roads.   ``No one must stop, walk, sit or play on the roads withoutsufficient reason,'' said the rules published Thursday in theWorking People's Daily.   It had no explanation why the rules were issued, and there wereno reports of government enforcement efforts.   Saw Maung has repeatedly pledged to hold multiparty electionsonce peace is restored to the impoverished nation, but he has setno exact timetable.   Three key opposition leaders _ Aung Gyi, Tin Oo and Aung San SuuKyi _ on Saturday announced the formation of ``The National UnitedFront for Democracy'' to bring together the millions of students,Buddhist monks and government workers struggling for democracy.   But their statement spelled out no specific strategy and did notdirectly respond to the government offer of elections.   The main anti-government activity is a general strike that beganAug. 8 and paralyzed the government administration. Authoritieshave ordered civil servants back to work by Oct. 3.   The three opposition figures earlier sent Saw Maung a letterasking for a halt to what they say have been the arrests ofstudents, Buddhist monks and other protest leaders.   Diplomats say Saw Maung is a close associate of strongman NeWin, who seized power in a 1962 coup and ruled until July, when heresigned after mass street protests.   They say the coup may have been staged to preserve the rulingmilitary autocracy, the power behind the short-lived rule of NeWin's hard-line successor, Sein Lwin, and Maung Maung, the civilianpresident ousted by Saw Maung.</TEXT></DOC>
