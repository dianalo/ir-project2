(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scandals surrounding two of the mostprominent ministers of the Assemblies of God may have created afalse impression that the church is riddled with disciplineproblems, an official said Monday.   The evangelical church, which counts more than 16 millionadherents worldwide and operates four colleges in Springfield, isinvestigating the misconduct of Louisiana evangelist JimmySwaggart. Officials say Swaggart has revealed an undisclosedtransgression. On Sunday, he tearfully stepped down from histelevision pulpit.   Another prominent television evangelist, the PTL's Jimmy Bakker,lost his Assemblies of God credentials last year amid charges ofsexual misconduct. Swaggart was said to have been active inuncovering that scandal and Bakker accused him of plotting to takeover PTL.   `Those are the only two in our whole denomination that have thatkind of recognition,'' said church spokeswoman Juleen Turnage. ``Sopeople may feel that this is indicative of the Assemblies of Goddenomination, and that is not true.   ``We have over 30,000 credentialed ministers in the Assembliesof God in the United States. At any given time, any given year,fewer than one-half of 1 percent are ever called into discipline....''   Mrs. Turnage said 12 areas of misconduct, ranging from doctrinalaberrations to moral failure, call for disciplinary action.   Mrs. Turnage said that, according to by-laws, the church'sLouisiana district has six months to complete its investigation ofSwaggart, though it is not expected to take that long.   ``Now that he has confessed to the sin, it will be a matter ofthe district meeting and forwarding a report and itsreccommendation to the executive presbytery here in Springfield,''Mrs. Turnage said.   Swaggart could be suspended or dismissed as an Assembliesminister. In either case, he would have the option of entering arehabilitation program that would take at least two years, Turnagesaid.   Swaggart appeared before his congregation in Baton Rouge, La.,Sunday to ask forgiveness from his family and church for an act hedid not describe publicly. He said he would not return to hispulpit until the church investigation was completed.</TEXT></DOC>
