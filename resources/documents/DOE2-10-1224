Theacidic gases studied were sulfur dioxide and phosphorus pentoxide. Theprocess parameters studied include temperature, gas flow rate, humidity,and acidic gas inlet concentration. At the conditions tested, the removalefficiency typically exceeded 99%. However, lime utilization andgt; 9% wasnot tested. Test data indicate that sulfur dioxide and phosphorus pentoxidereadily react with calcium oxide in a bubbling bed operating between480 and 650 C (900 and 1200 F).</TEXT></DOC>
