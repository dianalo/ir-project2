Two emplacement methods arecurrently being considered at Yucca Mountain. The reference configurationstores the high-level waste in short vertical boreholes, and the alternativeconfiguration stores the waste in long horizontal boreholes. After emplacementoperations for each emplacement drift are complete, the drift will beclosed off from continuous ventilation. Given time, the radioactive decayof high-level waste will increase the rock temperature around accessand emplacement drifts. Air cooling may be required to reenter thesedrifts. The paper discusses the analysis procedure and computer programsused to evaluate the time to cool a drift to acceptable environmentalconditions 50 years after emplacement of high-level waste. Key assumptionsto the analysis are presented. The results of the study show that coolingeither vertical or horizontal configuration emplacement drifts is possiblein a reasonable period of time. 4 refs., 5 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
