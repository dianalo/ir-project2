Iacocca continues to reap huge profits from stock options and grants that the auto maker gave him during its lean years.    Chrysler's proxy statement shows that Mr. Iacocca received total compensation of $17.9 million in 1987, after getting $20.6 million in 1986. The amounts dwarfed the sums paid to top executives at General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., and again made Mr. Iacocca one of America's most highly compensated corporate chiefs.    As in the two previous years, most of Mr. Iacocca's 1987 haul came from the exercise of stock options he received when Chrysler was struggling to survive seven years ago, and from outright stock grants that the company gave him as incentive to stay on during those times.    It clearly has paid for him to stay, and to engineer Chrysler's turnaround from the brink of bankruptcy. In the past three years alone, Mr. Iacocca has received nearly $50 million in compensation -- less than $4.2 million of it salary and bonuses.    For 1987, Mr. Iacocca's salary and bonus totaled $1.73 million, below the $3.7 million earned by Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen and nearly equal to the $1.7 million earned by GM Chairman Roger B. Smith.    But in total compensation, Mr. Iacocca is the heavyweight of the group. His $17.9 million last year towered over Mr. Smith's $2.2 million (including the exercise of stock options) and the $3.7 million paid to Mr. Petersen, who didn't exercise any options. Mr. Iacocca also handily beat Ford Vice Chairman Harold A. Poling, whose exercise of stock options brought his total 1987 compensation to $10.9 million.    Much of Mr. Iacocca's compensation came from the lump-sum payment of 112,500 shares of Chrysler stock under a 1983 agreement that promised the payment if he remained with the company through the end of last year. When he received the stock in early December, it was valued at $2.4 million and carried interest and dividends valued at $305,638.    Mr. Iacocca wasn't the only Chrysler executive to reap large stock gains last year. According to the company's proxy statement, Gerald Greenwald, chairman of the Chrysler Motors unit, received $6.6 million in salary, bonuses and Chrysler stock-option profits, $5.3 million of that from stock options alone.    Former Chrysler Motors President Harold K. Sperlich received $4 million for the year, with $2.8 million of that coming from Chrysler stock options. Chrysler told shareholders that when Mr. Sperlich retires effective July 1, it will pay him $200,004 for consulting work over the following 12 months.    A Chrysler spokesman defended the high executive gains last year as rewards for improving Chrysler's financial health. &quot;About 75% of what Mr. Iacocca got last year came from the increased value of the company's stock,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;We don't manage this company to make the value of the stock go down and we don't apologize when it goes up.&quot;    At the end of 1983, Chrysler shares were trading for $12.50. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, they closed at $23.125.    Mr. Iacocca himself didn't comment on his 1987 compensation. Last year, after the company disclosed that his pay reached $20.6 million for 1986, he jokingly portrayed himself as an example for children. &quot;If little kids don't aspire to make money like I did, what . . . good is this country?&quot; he said. &quot;You gotta have a role model, right?&quot;    From Sept. 1, 1979, to Sept. 1, 1980, Mr. Iacocca took just $1 in pay from Chrysler. When the company later repaid him for that lean year, he donated the money to charity.    The United Auto Workers yesterday called Chrysler's 1987 executive compensation &quot;stratospheric&quot; and said the sums &quot;blatantly contradict the message&quot; about cutting waste that Chrysler officials try to send workers. UAW Vice President March Stepp called the payments &quot;near criminal.&quot;    The union's statement also alluded to its current contract talks with Chrysler. When the talks began Monday, Chrysler's chief negotiator, Anthony P. St. John, announced that the company wouldn't pay executive bonuses in any year Chrysler failed to pay profit sharing to workers. But UAW President Owen Bieber and Mr. Stepp stated yesterday that Chrysler's profit-sharing proposal was a &quot;step in the right direction that doesn't address the gross disparities between overall compensation from the executive suite to the shop floor.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
