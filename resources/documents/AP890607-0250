The contract for July delivery of West Texas Intermediate, thebenchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, dropped 79 cents to $19.67 a42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, followingTuesday's decline of 6 cents.   The selloff was most severe in the wholesale home heating oilpits. The July contract for No. 2 heating oil settled at 48.71 centsa gallon, a loss of 2.29 cents on the day.   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,unleaded gasoline for July delivery fell 1.60 cents to 63.34 cents agallon.   Madison Galbraith, an energy specialist with Merrill Lynch EnergyFutures, said the market reacted skeptically to the agreementannounced by the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries.   The cartel's ministers, meeting in Vienna, decided to raiseOPEC's production ceiling to 19.5 million barrels a day for the Julyto December period. The current output cap of 18.5 million barrelsdaily expires at the end of this month.   The agreement retains the cartel's benchmark price of $18 abarrel for the last half of the year.   But the OPEC ministers apparently didn't come up with a solutionto the problem of members exceeding their self-imposed outputquotas. The cartel has been pumping an estimated 21 million barrelsa day in recent weeks, energy analysts say.   ``The market told OPEC today: `We don't believe in you ... Wedon't believe your numbers','' said Galbraith.   The market initially displayed some strength when it wasannounced that the new OPEC production ceiling was lower than the 20million to 21 million barrels a day some analysts had anticipated.   But doubts about OPEC's ability to abide by its accord created anopportunity for traders to sell and collect profits. Selling wasdominated by large commercial energy brokers, Galbraith said.</TEXT></DOC>
