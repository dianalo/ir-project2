In the U.S., Louisiana and Oklahomahave begun installing such systems on state toll roads.   ATandamp;T, based in New York, wouldn't disclose the expectedprice of its systems or toll-road authorities that might useit. However, the agreement follows a larger pact announced inAugust between the telecommunications giant and ToyotaGroup's Nippondenso Co.   ATandamp;T and Nippondenso plan to produce a similar system forJapan that lets car drivers use ATandamp;T's smart card to payhighway, bridge and tunnel tolls without stopping at tollbooths.
