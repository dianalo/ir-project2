Representatives of Nestle and AHP have rejected the accusationsand said they were complying with World Health Organization andindividual national codes on the subject.   ``After the World Health Assembly passed its resolution callingfor an end to the industry practice of dumping formula supplies inhospitals and maternity wards almost 2{ years ago, we assumed thatNestle and the other formula manufacturers would abide by theresolution,'' Janice Mantell, the executive director of Action forCorporate Accountability, said in a news release.   ``Since that time, we have been patiently meeting with thecompanies, and writing to the companies and waiting for them tochange the dangerous promotional tactic. ... The hard fact is thatbabies are dying as the companies are violating the WHAresolution.''   She said her group asked Nestle and AHP to present a plan forending their supplies programs by today. ``Neither company hasproduced one,'' she said. ``We have no other recourse but to askfor public support of a boycott against these two companies.''   The boycotts will focus on two products from each company, ACAsaid. The Nestle boycott will focus on Taster's Choice InstantCoffee, and Coffeemate Non-dairy Coffee Creamer. Coffeemate is aproduct of Carnation, which is a wholly-owned Nestle subsidiary.The AHP boycott will focus on Anacin aspirin and the Advil brand ofibuprofin, a pain reliever.   Action for Corporate Accountability, based in Minneapolis,Minn., is the successor of groups that organized a boycott againstNestle from 1977-1984 in the United States and nine othercountries. The groups halted the boycott after Nestle agreed tocomply with the World Health Organization Code.   Action for Corporate Accountability said its ``evidence revealssystematic corporate dumping of large quantities of baby milk onThird World hospitals, which violates national law in somecountries, and defies World Health Organization restrictions on themarketing of infant formula.''   ``Through sophisticated promotional techniques, the infantformula industry persuaded hundreds of thousands ofpoverty-stricken mothers in the Third World that formula feedingwas best for their children,'' ACA said. ``As a result, theindustry created a nearly $6 billion market for a product that isinferior in every respect to breastfeeding. In areas where sanitaryconditions for cleaning bottles are unavailable, water is impureand the level of income does not permit families to purchasesufficient quantities of formula for their infants, use of theproduct is deadly.''   Janice Mantell, the executive director of ACA, said that in thepoorest U.S. communities, ``women who have been persuaded not tobreastfeed their infants over-dilute the formula to make theexpensive product last longer. Their infants are, quite literally,starving as a result.''   A Washington spokesman for Nestle, Dr. Thad Jackson, insistedthat the company is in ``total compliance'' with national andinternational codes. He also specifically denied that the companyis dumping infant formula in foreign hospitals.   ``We do not dump supplies in hospitals,'' said Jackson. ``Weonly supply materials at their request, and in appropriateamounts.'' He said if the supplies requested by the hospitals fordistribution seems ``excessive then we contact the hospital.''   AHP spokeswoman Carol Emerling said, ``This whole activity isbased on allegations that we violate the WHO code _ and we flat outdeny it.''   ``The real issue is infant health. Breast-feeding is best forinfants; we've always said that,'' she said. ``But every infant whois not receiving breast milk has the right to the best alternativeavailable. That alternative is a scientifically formulated infantformula that is as close to breast milk as man can make it. Andthat is what our infant formula products are.''   The WHO code permits donations or concessionary sales of formulafor distribution to infants needing breast milk substitutes andsays it may not be used for sales promotion.</TEXT></DOC>
