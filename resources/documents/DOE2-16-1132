<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-16-1132 </DOCNO><TEXT>The characteristics of optical power energy transmission using opticalfibers were studied through experiments. As a result, the following pointswere made clear. 1. Low-loss, small-size optical fibers with its corediameter of several ten micrometers can be used for short-distance transmission.However, in the case of long-distance transmission, the efficiency decreasesbecause of the nonlinear optical effect generated in the optical fiber.2. Large core size optical fiber of several hundred micrometers in diameteris almost immune to the nonlinear optical effect, but the transmissionloss is no less than several times or ten times that of ordinary opticalfibers for telecommunications. 3. For otical power energy transmissionusing optical fibers, optimum system design is necessary in considerationof the above two points. 4. Various nonlinear optical effects generatedin the optical fibers seem rather useful for optical amplifiers and opticalsensors. (21 figs, 7 tabs, 16 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
