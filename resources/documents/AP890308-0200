In presenting the main principles of the new constitution,Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar said the drafters of the U.S.Constitution faced many of the same pitfalls Hungary confronts today.   The constitution, which would mark a significant break from thecurrent 1949 constitution modeled after the Soviet one, is toguarantee civil and human rights and the existence of variousparties.   Parliament, which began its session Wednesday, also was told byPremier Miklos Nemeth that the government will consider calling areferendum on its highly controversial Danube power project.   It was the first indication Hungary might consider withdrawingfrom the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros project, which it is building jointlywith Czechoslovakia and with Austrian financial backing.   Environmentalists in Hungary argue that the project will causeirreparable damage to the river.   A new law on referendums is due in June. It is part of a packageof political reforms designed to complement the new constitution,which is to be adopted by referendum early next year.</TEXT></DOC>
