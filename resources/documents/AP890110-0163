While Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said the limits shouldremain in place, General Motors Corp., the nation's largestautomaker, said the quotas have become ``less and less relevant''and the extension is ``almost symbolic.''   The quotas ``are not constraining shipments from Japan and arenot expected to under current market conditions,'' GM said. ``Moreimportantly, the focus on (quotas) distracts from the real tradeissue _ the need for further opening of the Japanese market toexports from the United States.''   Far from helping the U.S. auto industry, the quotas may make itmore difficult for the Big Three automakers to compete, said DavidHealy, automotive analyst with the New York brokerage house DrexelBurnham Lambert.   ``It is almost a psychological limit rather than a real limit inthe sense that the Japanese shipped fewer than 2.3 million vehiclesto the United States in the last couple of Japanese fiscal years,''Healy said. ``I think it could probably be scrapped without any realeffects.''   Japanese makers have successfully circumvented the quotas bybuilding more cars at plants in the United States and by exportingmore expensive cars. The quotas are set by the number of vehiclesrather than by their value, and the effect has been ``morecompetition in the expensive and medium price bracket for the U.S.auto companies,'' Healy said.   In Congress, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee, said the quota as it stands today istoo high to work.   ``There is sufficient cheating so that the number just doesn'thave that much meaning,'' Dingell said. ``The Japanese manufacturersdo everything they can to get around it. They're willing to callcars anything from trucks to wagons ... if it will help.''   Quotas cover cars but exclude light trucks and utility vehicles.   After making unprecedented inroads into the U.S. auto market,Japan in 1981 sought to deflect protectionist sentiment in theUnited States by voluntarily limiting its car exports.   The Japanese automakers are presently limited to exporting 2.3million cars a year to the United States, a level they have failedto attain in recent years as a stronger yen on internationalexchange markets has forced up dollar prices of Japanese cars.   Japan's minister of international trade and industry, HiroshiMitsuzuka, said his government was concerned the Japanese automakerswould push for more U.S. sales, thereby aggravating trade tensionswith the United States.   The Japanese trade surplus with the United States in 1987 was$59.8 billion and constituted the largest portion of the overall$171.2 billion U.S. trade deficit. Japan expects to export 2.2million cars to the United States in the fiscal year ending inMarch, Mitsuzuka said.   ``We are pleased that Japan has responded to the concerns raisedby the (United Auto Workers union) and others in agreeing to renewthe (quotas) for another year,'' said UAW President Owen Bieber.``At the same time, we are disappointed that they did not respond toour proposal to adjust the ... limit downward so as to makeallowance for the growth of low-U.S. content transplant assemblies.''   Despite Japan's worries about trade tensions with the UnitedStates, the Reagan administration considers itself to have no rolein the decision to continue the quotas, said Kelly Shipp,spokeswoman for U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.   ``It is solely a Japanese decision,'' she said. ``The presidentinformed the Japanese government four years ago that theadministration considered that ... the U.S. industry had recoveredits competitiveness, and there was no need to continue therestraint.''   Japanese automakers produced 733,000 cars in the United Stateslast year through November, up 23.2 percent from the same period in1987, according to the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo.   Ford, the nation's second-largest automaker, said it was``pleased that the Japanese government has recognized that some formof restraint is necessary until the serious imbalance of U.S.-Japantrade is corrected,'' citing the U.S. deficit with Japan not only inautomobiles but in semiconductors, textiles and steel.   Chrysler Corp. also said it believed the decision to continue thequotas was correct.   In the showroom, continuation of the quotas will mean prices ofJapanese cars will remain higher than would otherwise be the case,said Martin Pierce, vice president of Alexandria Toyota inAlexandria, Va.   ``Anything that gives us additional product is good not only goodfor us, but it is good for the consumer because having the supply ofvehicles results in lower prices as a result of competition,''Pierce said. ``If there is a contrived shortage, the consumer isgoing to pay more.''</TEXT></DOC>
