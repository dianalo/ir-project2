Box 1396, Houston, Texas 77251, filed in Docket No. CP89-1808-000,a petition for an order declaring that a certain activity as proposed byTevco is a temporary act or operation for which the issuance of a certificateunder section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) is not required in thepublic interest and is therefore exempt from the requirements of that section.The activity, it is stated, for which Tevco seeks the exemption is theoperational field testing of a new prototype low cost, high efficiencycompressor design at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation's (Transco)Compressor Station 100 in Chilton County, Alabama, all as more fully setforth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open topublic inspection.It is stated that Tevco, in conjunction with Pipeline Compressor Systems,Inc, has designed and developed a new high efficiency, low cost 8,000 horsepowermonobloc gas pipeline compressor. It is also stated that a prototype ofthis compressor design has been constructed and undergone complete andextensive full load factory testing. Tevco states that it is now preparedto perform final testing and evaluation of the compressor under actualfield operating conditions and upon the successful completion of such testing,to begin commercial manufacture and marketing of this new low cost compressor.Tevco states that the Monobloc compressor represents an advancement inpipeline compressor technology resulting in significant savings in capitaland operating and maintenance costs over conventional compressor systems.Tevco states that the compressor is comprised of a high speed, high efficiencyinduction motor driving two separate compressor sections. It is explainedthat the motor's rotor is supported by extremely low friction magneticradial and thrust bearing and is driven by a solid state variable frequencydrive system. Also, it is explained, the compressor's controls includevalve sequencing, auto start/shutdown and various system monitoring andshutdown devices.Tevco states that it has caused extensive in-house factory testing of theMonobloc to be performed; however, prior to introduction to market, theMonobloc must be tested under actual operating conditions for a periodof approximately three to five years to evaluate the system's reliability.It is stated that Transco has agreed to permit Tevco to place in serviceand test the Monobloc at Compressor Station 100 on Transco's pipeline locatedin Chilton County, Alabama.Tevco maintains that the testing of the Monobloc is a temporary and minoroperation. Tevco explains that the Monobloc's testing will be temporary,three to five years depending upon the initial degree of success of thetest. Tevco also explains that the test is a minor operation in that itaffects only one compressor station on Transco's pipeline and will notrequire the replacement or removal of any existing equipment. It is furtherexplained that testing of the Monobloc will have no effect on Transco'srates. It is stated that Tevco and Transco have entered into a lease arrangementto facilitate the testing of the Monobloc and that Transco has agreed topay Tevco an amount equal to the cost Transco would have otherwise incurredin operating its own compressor equipment. It is also stated that Transco'sratepayers will not bear any costs associated with system design, prototypeconstruction, equipment procurement, site preparation, installation oroperation and maintenance of the Monobloc compressor. In addition, it isstated that the Monobloc compressor will be installed in parallel withTransco's existing equipment which will serve as a back-up should the Monoblocexperience a failure or be shut down for evaluation or maintenance. Itis stated that should the need arise, Transco's existing equipment canimmediately be placed on line without affecting service.Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference tosaid petition should on or before August 14, 1989, file with the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to interveneor a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rulesof Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211). All protests filedwith the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriateaction to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties tothe proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to the proceedingmust file a motion to intervene.<ITAG tagnum="6">Lois D.
