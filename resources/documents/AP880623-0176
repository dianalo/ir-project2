Sir Edmund Hillary, who reached Everest's summit in 1953, saidtoo many teams are tackling the mountain, and expeditions should beput off for five years to give snows time to bury trash fromprevious climbs on Everest in the Himalayas.   But if Everest is going to be tackled, Hillary said he wouldrather see everyday climbers giving it a try rather than ``primadonnas'' who criticize attempts made with the aid of oxygen, fixedropes and high altitude porters.   Hillary was in Seattle on Wednesday on his way to Poulsbo,Wash., to receive the 1988 Charles Lindbergh Award, given to peoplewhose life's work exemplifies a balance between technologicaladvancement and environmental preservation.

When he unveiled his wax likeness at Madame Tussaud's onThursday he joked that he wasn't sure if it resembled him.   ``I don't know,'' said the 24-year-old prince, third son ofQueen Elizabeth II. ``I have never seen myself at this time in themorning.''   The ceremony was scheduled to fit in before his job at a theaterproduction assistant, and Edward told reporters, ``if you arewondering why you are here at 8 a.m. it is because I did mysittings at that time and I think I should look much the same.''   Museum officials said the prince had not been included in theroyal family exhibit before because young people change too rapidlyto have a long-lasting likeness.   The prince's wax figure was dressed in his own clothes and wascomplete with true-to-life thinning hair, a fact the prince alsonoticed.   ``He's got more hair. That's slightly embarrassing,'' he said.</TEXT><DATELINE>GRAND ISLAND, Neb.
