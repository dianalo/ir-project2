(editorial)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Millikin, Michael D.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>THERE'S AN informal law for the industry that says today's solution will bewoefully inadequate tomorrow.andP;  That's fine, and only to be expected.andO;Upgrading CPUs to bigger, faster solutions is a part of the landscape.andP;  Thosevendors that make upgrading a matter of a simple swap of a board in the field(look at Digital's new 6000 systems) are going to do much betterandM;than a vendor that forces users to buy entirely new systems.andM;THE NETWORKING DILEMMA.andP;  But what to do about networking? No matter howwell-implemented, a network-particularly a wide area network-can bog downfrom too much success.andP;  The more users use it, the more service can degrade.andM;Furthermore, we are poised on the brink of a move to a new generation ofapplications exemplified by the OfficeVision suite of products from IBM andthe new DECwindows applications from Digital (DECwrite, DECdecision,DECimage, etc.).andM;These applications, with their requirements for moving large chunks of dataaround the network (raster graphics, for example), will mandate higher speednetworking.andP;  Anyone wishing to use IBM's Metaphor-based DIS system, forexample, must have a 16 Mbps token ring.andP;  The older 4 Mbps token ring won'thack it.andM;Those demands will cause enormous cost problems unless vendors can provide away to support relatively inexpensive upgrades to the newer media.andM;CASE IN POINT.andP;  Proteon is providing an excellent example of what to do rightin this respect.andP;  First, and most important for the short term, Proteon hasannounced coming support for a 16 Mbps token ring over unshielded twistedpair (UTP) with a hub-to-workstation distance that covers the vast majorityof installation requirements.andM;While we don't want to go off the deep end extolling the importance of UTPsupport, it is quite important to the proliferation of advanced applicationsolutions.andP;  Providing 16 Mbps over UTP (IBM said it couldn't be done rehably)removes a barrier to implementation.andM;Proteon goes beyond just offering a cost-effective, higher speed token ringalternative, however.andP;  Its new Series 70 Intelligent Wire Center also offersa great deal of flexibility.andP;  The Series 70 wiH work with a variety of media:unshielded twisted pair, twisted pair, IBM types I and 6, and ATandamp;T PDS.andO;Support for fiber optics and repeaters will come later this year.andP;  This typeof flexibility is just the ticket-for the systems of the '90s.andM;NOS WARS.andP;  Flexibility is the key to surviving the Network Operating System(NOS) slugfest between LAN Manager and Novell that has sporadically continuedsince the announcement of LAN Manager more than two years ago.andM;It's clear that LAN Manager-based systems aren't yet about to become a floodthat washes away the NetWare base.andP;  It's also clear that LAN Manager-basedplatforms are extremely competitive functionally with NetWare-but that cutstwo ways.andM;Now, Novell is making it clear that it can run applications such as SQLServer on a NetWare network.andP;  Furthermore, it intends (in the latestiteration of die OS/2 strategy) to port portable NetWare over to OS/2 (oncethe 32-bit version of Os/ 2 comes chugging out from Redmond).andP;  Suchadaptability will make it all the harder for LAN Manager systems to displaceNetWare systems and wiH make the contest for new systems much more than evenMicrosoft/3Com had originally hoped.andM;DON'T TAKE SIDES.andP;  Systems vendors will have to support both.andP;  We've alreadypreached about this type of adaptability, adducing Hewlett-Packard'sstrategic alignment with LAN Manager, which is accompanied by support forintegrating NetWare as well.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
