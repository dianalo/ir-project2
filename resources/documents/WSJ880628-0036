Unicorp American is a real estate and financial services investment firm partly owned by Toronto-based Unicorp Canada Corp. In 1987's second quarter, Unicorp American earned $872,000, or six cents a share, on revenue of $10 million.    The expected charge stems from a write-down on investments in unconsolidated units, primarily its 38% stake in Milwaukee-based American Medical Buildings, which earlier this month said it expects a second-quarter loss of as much as $4 million. In the year-earlier second quarter, American Medical, a construction concern, earned $718,000, or seven cents a share, on revenue of $12.3 million.    Wayne J. Stemmer, Unicorp American's president, said: &quot;The loss, while significant, doesn't impact on cash flow or Unicorp American's core operations. Unicorp American's future remains positive as we narrow our focus back to financial services and real estate.&quot;    Yesterday, Unicorp American closed at $6.375, off 25 cents a share, in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange. </TEXT></DOC>
