Iraq proposed direct talksbetween the belligerents.   Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, called thecease-fire date ``D-Day.'' He said he prefers direct negotiationsbetween the parties, but Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afarMahallati declared: ``No, No.''   Iran announced Monday it would accept 598, a year-old SecurityCouncil resolution demanding an end to the 8-year-old war.   Iran's revolutionary and spiritual leader, Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini, told his people Wednesday that accepting a truce withIraq was ``more deadly to me than poison'' but he asked them tosupport his decision. Khomeini had adamantly opposed ending the warbefore Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was driven from power. Hesaid could not reveal yet why he changed his mind.   The council on Wednesday unanimously adopted a mild resolutionexpressing ``deep distress'' over the accidental U.S. destructionof an Iranian passenger jet on July 3, with the loss of 290 lives.   Iran wanted the United States condemned for the incident andMahallati said after the resolution was adopted, ``I am notsatisfied.'' The United States said the USS Vincennes mistook theairliner for an attacking Iranian warplane.   In the Persian Gulf, the war continued. Iran said its jetfighters flew four sorties Wednesday over northeastern Iraq,bombing the area around the Dukan Dam and troop positions near HajOmran. It said the attacks were retaliation for Iraqi raids Tuesdayon industrial targets in southwestern Iran.   Iraq said two Iranian jets tried to bomb the dam near Kirkuk atabout dawn but missed and anti-aircraft fire chased them off. TheIraqis said their own planes attacked two oil pumping stations nearIzeh in southwestern Iran and captured territory in the mountainousnorthern border region.   Wednesday was the anniversary of the adoption last July ofResolution 598, which provides for an immediate cease-fire,withdrawal of military forces to recognized borders, prisonerexchange and an investigation to determine who started the war.   The Iraqis said soon afterward they would accept it if Iran did,but the Iranians said no truce could take effect until Iraq wasbranded the aggressor. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 afterseveral border skirmishes.   Perez de Cuellar said a team of 10-12 military officers fromU.N. Middle East operations would work out cease-fire details withofficials in Baghdad and Tehran and return in no moe than a week.He did not announce their itinerary.   After that, the secretary-general said, he will announce astarting date ``promptly'' and set dates for troop withdrawal,prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and the investigation ofresponsibility for the war.   When the cease-fire takes effect, Perez de Cuellar said, he willsend up to 250 military observers into the area to verify andsupervise the truce and withdrawal of military forces.   He said the team leaving immediately would be from the U.N.Truce Supervision Organization based in Jerusalem and led by Lt.Gen. Martin Vadset, the group's chief of staff. A politicalofficer, whom he did not identify, is to join the group.   Perez de Cuellar said he would continue separate negotiations inNew York with Iranian and Iraqi representatives.   Asked about the Iraqi proposal for direct talks, he said: ``Ihave no objection. I have a preference for direct negotiations.''He noted that Resolution 598 calls for negotiations between the twosides.   Mahallati, the Iranian envoy, rejected direct talks in commentsto reporters. Another Iranian diplomat, Mohammad Javad Zarif, toldjournalists his country will observe a cease-fire during thetechnical team's visit and continue an informal cease-fire later ifIraq does the same.   Iraq's proposal for direct talks was contained in a letter toPerez de Cuellar from Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.   Aziz said it was necessary to test whether the Iranianacceptance of the resolution ``is serious or tactical ... withpartial or temporary solutions instead of a comprehensivesolution.''   The Iraqis have said Iran appears to be buying time to rebuildits economy and army so it can resume the war.   Another Iraqi proposal is that the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, whichforms the delta of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and is Iraq'sonly sea outlet, be cleared under U.N. auspices.   It forms the southern border between Iraq and Iran and where theline lies is in dispute. Iraq launched the initial invasion of thewar across the Shatt, which now is clogged with mines and sunkenships.   In his letter, Aziz also said Iraq wants an immediate guaranteeof its right to free navigation in the Persian Gulf and insistedthat Iran stop attacking tankers and other ships of nations notinvolved in the war.</TEXT></DOC>
