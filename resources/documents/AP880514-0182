And the bond market, which also had to contend with three majorTreasury auctions this past week, is bracing itself for moreturbulence ahead. Interest rates, which move inversely to bondprices, are widely expected to continue climbing.   ``In the short run, we still think rates are headed higher,''said Mitchell Held, chief financial economist for Smith Barney,Harris Upham andamp; Co.   Anxiety about inflation _ which erodes the value of fixed-incomeinvestments like bonds _ had been building for some time. It washeightened by a May 6 government report on the nation'sunemployment in April, which registered a 14-year low and wasviewed as showing underlying strength in the economy.   In the aftermath of that report, the Federal Reserve nudgedshort-term interest rates higher, and on Wednesday, major U.S.banks raised their prime lending rates by half a percentage pointto 9 percent.   The hike in the prime rate _ the first since October's stockmarket collapse _ proved anti-climactic, though, since it hadalready been foreshadowed by a rise in bond-market rates spurred bythe Fed's tightening.   ``The prime rate (increase) really was old history,'' said MariaRamirez, a managing director of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.   A far more exciting event for the bond market was the Treasury'sseries of three quarterly refunding auctions. The sales of $26billion in Treasuries on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, aimed athelping the government finance the $2.5 trillion national debt,were fairly well received by investors.   There had been concern recently that the growing inflationaryfears, by keeping bond prices depressed, could jeopardize theauctions. The bond market had been worried that investors _especially the Japanese _ could shy away from the Treasury sales ifthey detected a trend toward higher interest rates.   As it turned out, foreign investors did jump in to the auctions.They accounted for about 40 percent of the bond purchases over thethree days, Ms. Ramirez estimated.   The bond market rode out the interest-rate tempest and theauctions fairly calmly. Some market analysts suggested the creditmarkets may have been cushioned by a ``flight to safety'' onWednesday, as skittish investors pulled their funds out of thetumbling stock market and plowed them into bonds. The anxiety overinterest rates and the hike in the prime sent the Dow Jones averageof 30 industrials down 37.80 points that day to 1,965.85, athree-month low.   Many observers expect the rate on the key 30-year bond to riseto around 9.50 percent by the end of June, as inflationarypressures continue to mount.   Friday's Labor Department report on wholesale prices in April,showing only a moderate rise of 0.4 percent, was encouraging newsfor bond traders at the end of an unnerving week. But the market islooking forward with trepidation to a string of economic statisticsfor April due to be published this coming week: industrialproduction on Monday, factory capacity in use on Tuesday, housingstarts on Wednesday, and consumer prices and real earnings onFriday.   The nation's trade deficit for March is also scheduled to bereported, on Tuesday. The trade figures have been a powerfulinfluence on the bond market in recent months, as disappointingtrade performances have pushed the dollar lower and weakened bondprices in turn.   If the reports provide further evidence of economic strength,the inflation fears could accelerate.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions May 14-15</NOTE></DOC>
