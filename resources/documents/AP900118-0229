Colin Marshall, chief executive and joint deputy chairman of theBritish airline, said Wednesday an ``action group'' should be setup under the International Air Transport Association to deal withcrowded airports, runways and air traffic corridors.   ``What we need is an action group under the aegis of IATA, onewhich can approach the problems bluntly and directly, operatingfrom a basis of self-interest and at the same time of overallindustry concern,'' Marshall said in a speech to the Wings Club, anaviation industry group.   ``If we cannot create something like this, then I suspect theconstantly growing `airweed,' a cousin to that which can eventuallystop even the largest oceangoing ships, will bring us to a moribundhalt,'' he said.   Trump Shuttle President Bruce Nobles said he agrees withMarshall about the capacity problems but isn't sure aninternational task force is the solution.   ``It's an interesting idea but I don't know how necessary itis,'' he said in an interview following the speech.   Nobles is a member of the Partnership for Improved Air Travel, aU.S. lobbying group seeking to have money in the Airport and AirwayTrust Fund earmarked for system improvement. Because of pressure toreduce the federal budget deficit, neither the White House norCongress has been willing to dip into the aviation trust fund,which is supplied by an 8 percent tax that is included in air fares.   The Air Transport Association, a U.S. industry group inWashington, D.C., also said it found Marshall's proposalinteresting.   ``The U.S. airlines would certainly be willing to consider anymeasure that would have a realistic prospect of improving theworld's airports-airways capacity problem,'' said ATA spokeswomanKathleen Rosenauer. She declined to elaborate.   In his speech, Marshall suggested that six or seven ``capable''senior airline executives should get together with IATA todetermine how to set up an international task force.   ``British Airways would be willing to offer the services of oneof its best managers,'' he said, adding that ``we ... should nothave any greater part in it than anyone else.''   Asked whether he was offering himself as a potentialparticipant, Marshall replied, ``I'm not accustomed to hiding mylight under the bushes, so why not?''</TEXT></DOC>
