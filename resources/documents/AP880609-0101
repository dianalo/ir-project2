The vicious street fighting occurred around Yonsei University,where roughly 20,000 students had gathered for a march Friday toCommunist North Korea to press for unification of the dividedpeninsula.   Korea was split into the communist north and pro-Western southin 1945.   Students clashed with riot police in at least eight provincialcities when authorities tried to block marches in support ofFriday's march or tried to stop radicals going to Seoul.   Riot troopers guarded government buildings and diplomatic postsin Seoul to prevent student attacks. Hundreds of police ringed theU.S. Embassy.   In Seoul, police armored vans fired hundreds of tear gas bombsinto the charging students as special martial arts squads tried tohold the protesters off. At least a dozen riot policemen wereengulfed in orange flames after being hit by firebombs.   Scores of police and protesters were injured in the fighting.   The students had surged out the school's main gates to attackpolice after they heard the sound of fighting in nearby streets,where cordons of riot police were trying to turn away studentsattempting to reach the campus.   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' and ``March to NorthKorea!'' students yelled as they pelted the lines of riot policewith rocks and bricks.   Police, trying to fend off the attacks with shields, hurledrocks and bricks as well as tear gas grenades at the chargingprotesters.   Masked students repeatedly ran right up to the police lines tohurl firebombs at close range. Officers with fire extinguishersdoused the blazing clothes of comrades set on fire.   Students from dozens of colleges had gathered at Yonsei for anovernight vigil before trying to march Friday to the North Koreanborder in efforts to force unification of the divided peninsula.   North Korea's official news agency, monitored in Tokyo, said aNorth Korean student delegation already had left the capital ofPyongyang for the border to meet the South Korean students and seeka breakthrough for peaceful unification.   Earlier, police had arrested scores of students who were tryingto reach the Yonsei University campus and used tear gas to dispersegroups of students in nearby side streets.   National Police officials in Seoul reported that about 25,000students took part in rallies at 78 colleges nationwide, but thefigure appeared low.   In the southern city of Kwangju, about 1,000 students hurlingfirebombs and rocks attacked riot police when authorities tried tostop them leaving for Seoul. Police arrested about 200 students.   Students also fought police in Suwon, Taejon, Taeju, Mockpo,Chung, Iri and Kyongju.   The government deployed more than 60,000 riot police and put allsecurity forces on maximum alert to stop Friday's planned march tothe border truce site of Panmunjom, 30 miles north of Seoul.   Government leaders said the march was a threat to nationalsecurity and students were playing into the hands of the communistNorth. Opposition politicians urged the students to cancel themarch.   In Taejon, about 5,000 people held an anti-communist rally todayin front of the railway station to urge the students to abandon themarch.   Radical groups claim the United States enforces partition of thepeninsula and rules the south as a colony. Their protests have beenviolently anti-American, calling for withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S.troops in the south.   The students, a small but powerful minority, claim they are notcommunist but insist Korea must be reunited and ideologicaldifferences are secondary.   President Roh Tae-woo insists all contacts with the north behandled by the government. He has said he would seek meetingsbetween north and south students under proper supervision.   There are no inter-government unification talks now. The lastcontacts between the two sides were in 1985. North Korea rejectedtalks in 1986 because of U.S.-South Korean military exercises itsaid was preparation for war.   Both sides have proposals on new talks that the other rejects.   North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean Warand repeatedly has staged terrorist attacks over the years.</TEXT></DOC>
