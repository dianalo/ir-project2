 31-Feb.andP;  2).andP;  DB/EXPO's theme,&quot;Database Tools and Communications: We're Putting it all Together,&quot; reflectedits goal.andP;  Conference discussions centered around distributed data processingand the challenge of integrating database, CASE, expert systems, naturallanguage, and object-oriented technologies.andP;  By most accounts, it was anextremely successful and useful show, particularly for people working inmultiple platform environments (read &quot;large and small system shops&quot;).andM;Genesis of a showandM;Have you ever stopped to wonder how trade shows are born?andP;  DB/EXPO is a newshow.andP;  How did it come to be?andP;  The answer for DB/EXPO starts with norm deNardi.andM;de Nardi is a pioneer in the computer trade show business.andP;  He startedpromoting computing in 1970 with regional shows.andP;  He is the force behind theimportant mainframe-oriented California Computer and Graphics (CCGS) andAerospace and Defense Computing (ADC) shows.andP;  As de Nardi recounts, he gotthe idea for DB/EXPO about a year ago.andP;  He sensed that database technologywas the wave of the future and felt it should have its own forum.andM;After bouncing the idea around a bit, he talked to Colin White, editor andpublisher of InfoDB, the highly respected &quot;Journal for Large Systems DatabaseUsers&quot; and Database Review, a new bimonthly newsletter.andP;  White agreed thatdatabase technology was mature enough to support a show and set out arrangingthe program.andM;White's connections helped ensure an impressive line-up of speakers andparticipants.andP;  Conference attendees heard from relational philosopher ChrisDate, CASE guru Vaughan Merlyn, and the product managers of several of thedatabase servers.andP;  Attendees rubbed elbows with Dr. E.F.andP;  Codd, the father ofthe relational database model, and people formulating database strategies forIBM and DEC.andP;  Attendees ranged from MIS staff still using non-relationalDBMSs to senior product managers from the industry.andM;The conferencesandM;The quality of the conference presentations was high.andP;  In case you weren't inthe audience, here are some highlights:andM;Database: The Next Five YearsandM;Jnan Dash, Manager, Data Systems Strategy, IBMandM;Dash outlined IBM's vision of the future where DB2 (its mainframe relationalDBMS) serves as the foundation with ESA (Enterprise Systems Architecture),SNA (Systems Network Architecture) and SAA (Systems Application Architecture)as the glue.andP;  Although the mainframe DBMS market is still largelynon-relational (IMS/DB has the largest market share with about 22 percent),many IBM shops are moving to DB2.andP;  IBM's investing a lot of money to enhanceits product line with features like improved security and auditing controls,performance metrics, and a global information resource repository.andP;  In adistributed data processing environment, these kinds of management controlsbecome increasingly important.andM;These plans may not seem to affect the average PC user, but Dash predictedthat within two years the QMF (query management facility) in OS/2 ExtendedEdition Database Manager will be able to access data in a DB2 databasecompletely transparently.andP;  As OS/2 matures, we'll see its power grow.andM;Database: The Next Five YearsandM;Barry Rubinson, Manager, Product Architecture, DECandM;Rubinson's presentation was less product-specific.andP;  In the short-term, hesaid, SQL will become more entrenched as a lingua franca in distributed dataprocessing (DDP).andP;  Standards will be established for remote heterogeneousaccess with 2PC (2-phase commit) and security.andP;  (2PC refers to the protocolsthat need to be implemented to ensure data integrity across multipledatabases.andP;  It might be thought of as handshaking at the data level, not thecommunications level.)andP;  Guidelines for maintaining security will beformalized by a new &quot;security coloring book&quot; published by the Dept.andP;  ofDefense.andM;On the horizon are database technologies that will help deal with largeobjects, hierarchies like those that occur in the classic bill of materialsproblem, nested relations, and abstract data types.andP;  Tomorrow's databaseswill be able to better mesh with knowledge bases and CASE tools.andM;Rubinson characterized the hardware requirements for DBMSs as MIPs,megabytes, and milliseconds.andP;  He predicted we'll see CPU assists, storageassists, and perhaps even the integration of expert systems for automaticfailure prediction.andP;  He sees mixed vendor shops as a reality and hopesstandards for a data repository of metadata will emerge.andM;Distributed DatabaseandM;C.J.andP;  Date, Executive V.P., Codd andamp; Date, Inc.andM;Date opened his session by remarking that distributed database (DDB) is a hottopic, probably the most significant new development in the database worldsince relational systems appeared.andP;  He defined a DDB system as one thatallows (take a deep breath) &quot;an arbitrary collection of relations from anarbitrary collection of (relational) databases on a variety of differentmachines running a variety of different operating systems connected by avariety of different communications networks to function as if they were allstored in a single database on a single machine.&quot;andP;  Thus, a DDB is a &quot;virtualdatabase whose components are physically stored in a number of distinct realdatabases at a number of distinct sites.&quot;andM;He observed what we probably all realize, that in today's world, there aretoo many &quot;islands of information.&quot;andM;He then proposed 12 objectives for DDB as follows:andM;* Local AutonomyandM;* No reliance on a central siteandM;* continuous operationandM;* Location independenceandM;* Fragmentation independenceandM;* Replication independenceandM;* Distributed query processingandM;* Distributed transaction managementandM;* Hardware independenceandM;* Operating system independenceandM;* Network independenceandM;* DBMS independenceandM;Some vendors later indicated that they thought Date's presentation was tootheoretical, too &quot;pie in the sky.&quot;andP;  However, Date has set up his dozenobjectives as a formal vision of the ideal distributed database.andM;Database FuturesandM;Marco Emrich, Senior Product Manager, Database Products, CincomandM;Robert Healy, V.P.andP;  of Marketing, Relational Technology Inc.andM;Ken Jacobs, RDBMS Product Manager, OracleandM;Bob Minns, V.P.andP;  of Technology, Cognos Stewart Schuster, V.P.andP;  of Marketing,SybaseandM;Roger Sipple, President, InformixandM;In this session, panel members described their product strategies andcandidly identified the problems facing database vendors today --performance, lack of interoperability, the need to ensure referentialintegrity, and the need for integrated tools, an integrated depository, andlarge data objects.andP;  Stewart Shuster aptly summarized their comments bysaying that the industry has a &quot;long way to go&quot; before it achieves truedistributed data processing as outlined by earlier speakers.andM;Understanding the CASEandM;marketplaceandM;Vaughan Merlyn, President, CASE ResearchandM;Since CASE technology is fairly new, Merlyn spent a few minutes defining itas Computer Aided Systems Engineering and establishing its parallel roots instructured methods (programming, design, and, finally, analysis) and thesystems &quot;life cycle approach.&quot;andP;  He sees Computer Aided Software Engineering(implemented in many 4GLs and applications generators) and IPSE (IntegratedProducts Support Environments, found particularly in Europe supportingrealtime processing environments) as intermediate steps in the trend towardsCASE technology.andM;He identified the major CASE market segments as MIS/DP, Engineering/EmbeddedSystems, and the Aerospace/Defense industry.andP;  With the convergence oftechnologies like increasingly powerful workstations, the graphicsrevolution, relational and distributed database, an increasing acceptance ofmodeling tools, the object-oriented approach, and expert systems, Merlyn seesCASE as an important development and control tool.andM;&quot;Methodologies and CASE are inseparable,&quot; he said, and poor understandingabout methodologies is one of the source of confusion in the CASE market.andO;Methodologies are basically recipes, complete with ingredients such asdiagramming techniques, for managing an organization's information resources.andO;Some methodologies are more suited to data-oriented processing, others toprocess-oriented systems.andP;  New methodologies for object-oriented systems needto be invented.andM;Exploiting CASE: Critical successandM;factors Linda Nadeau, Manager, Methodology, KnowledgewareandM;Nadeau peppered her presentation with lots of war stories and talked aboutthe difficulty in measuring increased productivity.andP;  She referred to JohnZachman's articles in the IBM Systems Journal as an excellent source ofinformation about an information systems architecture approach and included aslike from one of his articles that clearly summarized which diagrammingtools are appropriate for which information systems activity.andP;  Embracing alarge information system architecture will help keep organizations fromunknowlingly reinventing the wheels they already own.andM;One of the problems with the slow adoption of CASE, Nadeau feels, is thatmost of them are methodology based.andP;  Methodologies have come across asreligions, complete with zealots.andP;  &quot;Zealots,&quot; she explained, &quot;arephilosophers who want users to learn their philosophy and intuit the rules.&quot;andO;Most people, however, want to know the rules, sign the contract (If I go tochurch, I'll get to heaven), not learn the philosophy.andM;Despite the problems in today's CASE market, Nadeau feels that using CASEtools will increase productivity in organizations that re-use existing systemcomponents.andP;  How will this happen?andP;  CASE tools will force them to maintain anaccurate, up-to-date data repository.andM;New Development Technologies David Coleman, Director of Marketing, NaturalLanguage Mary Loomis, Hewlett-Packard Christ Loosley, Principal Consultant,Bachman Information Systems Richard McNees, V.P.andP;  of Business Development,Micro Focus Nicro Nierenberg, Founder, Unify Corp. Harry Reinstein, Presidentand CEO, Aion Corp.andM;It seemed to me that this panel reflected how far we are from trulyintegrated DDP.andP;  Panel members described their products, which ranged fromCASE tools and 4GLs to natural language interfaces and expert systems, asalmost self-contained solutions.andM;The star of the panel was clearly Mary Loomis.andP;  She describedHewlett-Packard's experimental prototype of an object-oriented DBMS.andP;  At asubsequent demo of the product, code-named IRIS, viewers learned that HP isgrappling with three major problems: the complex objects problem, thestructured objects (objects that are made up of other objects) problem, andthe legacy problem (how to deal with existing database file structures).andO;IRIS builds on Hewlett-Packard's New Wave (windowing) technology and uses aSQL-like language (OSQL, for Object SQL) to access the database.andO;Representatives of HP underscored the fact that IRIS is not a product, andthat nothing we saw (running under HP/UX, Hewlett-Packard's version of UNIX,ON AN HP 9000) was to be construed as a product announcement.andM;Nevertheless, my impression of the panel was that it reflected not only the&quot;islands of information&quot; problem, but also the &quot;islands of technology&quot;problem.andM;The Importance of SQL Colin White, Editor and Publisher, InfoDB, &quot;Journal forLarge Systems Database Users&quot; and Database ReviewandM;White gave an excellent analysis of SQL in its dual role of access method andrelational language.andP;  He recommended that purchasers consider the followingwhen selecting an SQL-based DBMS:andM;* DDB facilities provided (according to Date's rules)andM;* Enforced referential integrity across sitesandM;* How SQL optimization is implementedandM;* Whether authorization is required to access remote dataandM;* Whether object definitions can be created and maintained across systemsandM;* Performance options (such as stored procedures and block fetch)andM;* Provision for foreign DBMS gatewaysandM;He also provided an overview of standardization efforts and some of thefeatures users can expect it the next version of &quot;the SQL standard.&quot;andP;  Theyincluded an embedded data definition language (DDL), DDL extensions such asDROP, ALTER, and REVOKE; new data types, partial domain support, integrityextensions, system catalog views, scroll CURSORs, improved JOIN support,improved consistency, and so on.andM;Micro DBMSs: SQL database serversandM;and beyond Fabian Pascal, consultant and affiliate with Codd andamp; DateInternationalandM;After delivering a short sermon warning people about where to get theirinformation about SQL and relational database technology in general, Pascalreflected on two revolutions he's seen in computing: the advent of micros andthe acceptance of relational databases and SQL.andP;  He reminded listeners thatdatabase server technology isn't directly related to or dependent onrelational technology, but that they are obviously linked.andM;He warned that there are two ways to implement SQL: as an engine or as an SQLinterface.andP;  He then pointed out that the latter is usually done bynon-relational vendors under duress because of the &quot;must have SQLcompatibility&quot; syndrome that characterizes today's market.andP;  By implementingSQL as an interface instead of as an engine, vendors give programmers theopportunity to subvert relational integrity by writing calls to filesdirectly.andM;Information Architecture Design:andM;Data communications issues Ralph Hubbard, President, Hubbard TechnologyManagementandM;Hubbard's expertise is data communications and strategic information systemsplanning, and his presentation brought a new perspective to the problem ofDDP.andP;  Although it was probably comforting to the database types in theaudience to realize that they were't alone in having a shaky understanding ofcommunications issues, it pointed out the problems facing today's systemsplanners and developers.andP;  One really should have a foot in both camps inorder to make the right decisions.andP;  (By the way, databasers aren't alone intheir ignorance; data communications folks don't generally understandrelational databases that well, either.)andM;Hubbard identified the key issue in designing information architecture as theorganization and placement of data stores, and whether to maintain the datastores, and whether to maintain the data stores as centralized, distributed,or replicated.andP;  Technical, performance, and cost factors, of course, alsoaffect the design decision.andM;Developing an InformationandM;Architecture Jeffrey Tash, President, Database Decisions, Inc.andM;Tash sees the industry as being in a transition stage, similar to that of theauto industry in the 1930s, where technology-driven Ford yielded market shareto market-driven GM.andP;  He said that users want their own dedicated processor,shared data, transparent communications, and standards.andP;  The industry willdeliver part of the solution through the WIMP (Windows/Icons/Menus/Pulldowns)interface.andP;  Tash drew a chuckle from the crowd when, reflecting on WIMP, hesaid, &quot;Xerox created the technology, Apple made the market, and IBM makes themoney.&quot;andM;The Role of the Micro DBMS Dennis Comfort, V.P.andP;  of Development, Microrim KenEinstein, Director of Database Strategy, Borland Umang Gupta, President,Gupta Technologies Dave Kaplan, SQL Server Product Manager Microsoft RickPatch, V.P.andP;  of Business Development andamp; Product Planning, Micro DecisionwareJim Reilly, SQL Server Product Manager, Ashton-Tate Joe Winograd, V.P.andP;  ofNew Business Development, DB AccessandM;Given the large-system tone of dBExpo, the closing panel, moderated by DataBased Advisor Editor, David Kalman, set off to show that micro DBMSs areready for corporate MIS.andP;  What ensued was a display of how far both PCsoftware vendors and MIS still need to go before so-called &quot;cooperativeprocessing&quot; becomes widespread.andP;  A classic problem posed by audience memberswent something like this: &quot;I can use PCs to get data on my mainframe, but mymainframe can't get data on my PCs without user intervention on the PC end.&quot;andO;Without peer-to-peer mainframe/micro communications, this problem remainsunsolved.andM;FirstSQL unveiledandM;The DB/EXPO story wouldn't be complete without mentioning FirstSQL, the newrelational DBMS and application generator from start-up FFE Software.andO;FirstSQL requires 512K and a hard disk, includes a DB2-style systems catalog,fully supports all ANSI SQL Level One and most Level Two features, can accessdBASE files directly via SQL commands, and implements many advanced integrityconstraints.andP;  The latter include automatic integrity checks where new foreignkeys are verified against their parent primary key, options for handlingchanges to the primary keys (restrict and cascade) and the two distinct nullscalled for in extended relational theory.andP;  Although FirstSQL is not yetavailable in a network version it's coming soon (promises developer LeeFesperman).andP;  Fesperman, a former IBM employee, cut his teeth in relationaltechnology back in the days when E.F.andP;  Codd and Chris Date were formalizingit at IBM.andP;  For more information, contact FFE Software at P.O.
