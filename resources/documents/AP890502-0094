Under the proposal, the Soviet Union would be challenged to meetthe lower levels of the 16-nation North Atlantic TreatyOrganization, said the official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The weapons would be trimmed as part of NATO plans to modernizethe aging Lance surface-to-surface missile, a project that hassparked opposition in many European countries.   Further cuts in nuclear arms would be considered after progresswas made in recently opened arms talks in Vienna on slashingconventional, or non-nuclear, forces in Europe, the official said.   In Washington, a U.S. official confirmed the account but said itwas one of several options under consideration. The official, whospoke on condition of anonymity, said another option would be WestGermany resuming research and development of a non-nuclear missilethat could attack airfields and other targets now covered by theLance.   West Germany, where the Lance launchers are based, last monthdemanded early talks with the Soviets on reducing short-rangenuclear weapons. The United States and Britain strongly oppose theidea.   The U.S. ideas, put forward last week to NATO representatives inBrussels, could serve as elements of a possible way to resolve theissue prior to a NATO summit May 29-30.   The NATO official described the American plan ``as a proposalfor a working document for how to proceed on the issue. It doesn'toffer any compromise with the German proposal.''   NATO officials have been trying to find satisfactory language onthe weapons issue to include in a long-awaited blueprint of NATO'sstrategy in arms control and force planning that is to be presentedat the summit.   A senior U.S. official suggested last month that NATO may failto resolve the differences over the short-range weapons. He raisedthe possibility that the alliance would not reach a common positionin time for the summit.   Such an outcome would likely lead to speculation about seriousdivisions in NATO. The Western nations are trying to present aunited front in the face of defense cuts promised by SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   The NATO official said the American plan draws together severalideas that have been put forward in the alliance.   It would take reductions proposed by U.S. Gen. John Galvin,NATO's supreme military commander in Europe, in a recent study ofhis nuclear weapons requirements and challenge the Soviets to meetthe lower levels.   Galvin has pressed for NATO to agree to upgrade the Lancemissile, arguing its modernization would permit a substantialreduction in nuclear artillery.   The Lance missile was introduced in 1972 and will becomeobsolete in 1995, military analysts say. It has a range of a littlemore than 60 miles. The new one would be extended to more than 250miles, just under the limits of the Intermediate-range NuclearForces treaty.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said earlier in the yearthat a decision to deploy the new missiles should be delayed until1991 or 1992, which would be after elections next year in Germany.   NATO defense ministers, at a nuclear strategy session lastmonth, gave only lukewarm backing to the modernization program,saying nuclear forces ``must be kept up-to-date where necessary.''   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he was satisfied withthe endorsement and was ``reasonably confident'' Congress wouldprovide more money to continue development of the new generationLance.   There are currently 88 Lance launchers, most of which are basedin Germany. Officials have said the Warsaw Pact outnumbers NATO byabout 12-to-1 in short-range nuclear missile launchers.   The alliance contends it needs to maintain its nuclear stockpileto balance the enormous superiority the East has built up inconventional arms.   NATO and the seven Warsaw Pact countries began talks in March oncutting conventional forces in Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
