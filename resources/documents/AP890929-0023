Michel Camdessus, the former French central bank chief whoserves as managing director of the IMF, is urging that the fund'sresources, called quotas, be doubled from $120 billion to $240billion.   The increase is needed, he argued, to meet the agency's growingresponsibilities in the 1990s, including aiding Treasury SecretaryNicholas F. Brady's strategy to reduce the Third World's crushingdebt burden and helping Eastern European nations convert theireconomies from state control to free enterprise.   Also discussed during the three-day annual meeting of the IMFand its sister organization, the World Bank, were worldenvironmental problems and efforts by the major industrial nationsto stabilize their currencies' exchange rates.   Both organizations, headquartered in Washington, were foundedafter World War II to promote economic growth and stability.   On Thursday, after the closing session, Camdessus expressedconfidence that agreement can be reached on a quota increase by theend of the year.   Nineteen members of the fund's 22-member executive board supporta quota increase of 67 percent or more, he said. But Saudi Arabia,Great Britain and the United States, which holds veto power on thequestion, have yet to sign on.   Quotas are supplied from member nations' reserves and can bewithdrawn at any time. An increase would not add to the U.S. budgetdeficit.   President Bush told the organizations, ``The United Statesrecognizes that the IMF must have adequate resources to fulfill itscritical role'' and pledged to work on reaching a decision by theend of the year.   However, Treasury officials say the administration remainsunconvinced that IMF needs as much as its leaders are requesting.   Complicating the debate are touchy questions of nationalprestige for the United States' closest allies. In exchange forcontributing reserves, each nation receives a commensurate share ofvoting power in the IMF.   Japan has expressed a willingness to recycle more of the revenuefrom its huge trade surplus through the IMF, but only in exchangefor more influence in the organization.   It already holds the No. 2 slot in the World Bank and wants tovault from fifth to second in the fund, behind only the UnitedStates in voting power. That would displace Great Britain, whichdespite the efforts of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has fallenbehind Japan as a world economic power.   Delegates said a compromise is emerging that would permit Japanand West Germany to share the second slot, while France and GreatBritain would share the fourth position.   Meanwhile, World Bank President Barber B. Conable, a formerRepublican member of Congress from New York, is seeking areplenishment of the bank's International Development Agency, whichmakes low-interest loans to the world's poorest nations.   The United States is the lone holdout among 34 nations overproviding $14.5 billion for three years worth of loans, in partbecause its share of $3.2 billion would add to the budget deficit,unlike an increase in IMF quotas.   In other developments at the meetings:   _Bush and the other Western leaders warmly encouraged PolishFinance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz's efforts to secure aid in hiscountry's historic conversion of its economy from communism tocapitalism. However, they withheld promising specific amounts untilPoland agrees to a program of economic reforms with the IMF.Officials said that could come in as soon as two months.   _The IMF on Wednesday granted Argentina, Latin America's thirdlargest debtor, a $1.4 billion stabilization loan in reward foreconomic reforms instituted by its new president, Carlos Menem.   However, moves last week by three large U.S. banks to add toloan loss reserves for developing country debt raised concern amongdelegates that banks would be unwilling to follow the write offswith enough new lending to keep the borrowing countries growing.Bush, Camdessus and other officials used the meetings as anoccasion to urge bankers to continue to lend.   _The Group of Seven _ United States, Japan, West Germany, GreatBritain, France, Canada and Italy _ announced an accord on exchangerates. The group's central banks, starting Monday, intervenedvigorously in currency markets, driving the dollar's value down.The effort was aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit and theGerman and Japanese trade surpluses.</TEXT></DOC>
