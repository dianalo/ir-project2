The system discussed in this paper usesan IBM-XT microcomputer and software which provides flexible access tothe data base through various graphics routines. The data base containsinformation on various entities (highways, population centers) distinguishingbetween them through the use of color, size, and shape. Information concerningthese resources can be obtained from the data base and manipulated bymoving a cursor on the graphics screen to the area of interest. Informationcan be added to the data base through a similar routine. For example,in the event an obstruction occurs along a highway it can be shown graphicallyand input the data base through the graphics interface routine. Otherinformation can be added to simulate disaster events and emergency plans.Flexible graphics routines include a zoom feature that enables the userto draw a map to fit a set of coordinates (miles) specified by the user.The user can focus on any part of a map and enlarge the area as he wishes.The user can also elect to have the system draw a map containing certainentities (e.g., congregate care centers).</TEXT></DOC>
