KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The House voted Thursday to end all U.S.investment in white-dominated South Africa and impose a near-totaltrade embargo in what opponents called an election-year politcalploy.   Supporters hailed the sweeping disinvestment-trade embargomeasure, approved 244-132, as a last-chance opportunity to bringstrong economic pressure to bear to help end South Africa'sapartheid system of racial separation.   Republican opponents said the bill represents needlesslydestructive ``economic warfare'' and a ``scorched earth'' policyintended to score political points for Democratic presidentialcandidate Michael Dukakis and Democratic political activist JesseJackson on the eve of the GOP national convention.   In the rapidly dwindling time remaining in the 100th Congress,it is uncertain at best that the bill will be passed by the Senateor be cleared by Congress over President's Reagan's likely veto.   In a policy statement, the administration said Reagan's senioradvisers will recommend that he veto the sanctions bill if itemerges from Congress in its present form because it ``underminesthe president's ability to conduct foreign policy.''   Before the final vote, the House rejected threeRepublican-sponsored amendments, all aimed at diluting or reversingthe impact of the sanctions.   It defeated, 236-154, an amendment by Rep. William Broomfield,R-Mich., to permit the president to waive all sanctions if WestGermany, France, Britain, Italy and Japan do not impose sanctionsof equal strength. It also would have authorized the president toextend U.S. aid to help develop black private enterprise in SouthAfrica.   Rep. Jon L. Kyl, R-Ariz., was dealt a 214-169 defeat on hisamendment to permit the president to waive the section of the billbarring military and intelligence cooperation with South Africa ifhe certifies that is in ``the best interest of the United States.''   The House also defeated, 259-145, an amendment by Rep. DanBurton, R-Ind., to strike all new sanctions while retaining themore limited sanctions imposed in 1986. The amendment would haveurged U.S. companies operating in South Africa to contribute 15percent of their payroll to black development projects.   Broomfield insisted the sanctions bill was politically motivated.   ``Some of us wonder if the real purpose is to be responsive tothe Jackson-Dukakis foreign policy,'' Broomfield said.   ``We are not bringing this bill to embarrass Republicans,'' saidRep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., principal sponsor of the measure.``We are here to free black South Africa. This has nothing to dowith presidential politics.''   In an emotional summary that drew a standing ovation from hiscolleagues, Dellums told the House: ``I listened to those who saidthis is going to hurt blacks, it's going to hurt corporations. Buthuman beings will struggle for their freedom, in peace if they can,in violence if they must. ... That pales every single argument youhave made. We must end the madness of apartheid.''   At the State Department, deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley saidadditional sanctions against South Africa are much more likely toretard the end of apartheid than to accelerate its end.   ``We particularly regret the timing of this House action, whichcomes at a delicate moment in the important, serious U.S. mediationefforts between South Africa, Angola and Cuba,'' she said.   ``The House debate is more likely to complicate than to promotetheir successful conclusion.''   The U.S. effort is aimed at encouraging the withdrawal of Cubanand South African forces from Angola and independence and blackmajority rule for Namibia.   The disinvestment legislation has its roots in the economicsanctions voted by Congress in 1986. They banned all new public andprivate loans and investments in South Africa and barred certainimports and exports.   The bill contains these major provisions:   _All U.S. investment in South Africa would be banned and U.S.corporations with such investments would be compelled to divestthem. The investment ban would not apply to any business in whichblacks or other non-whites have at least a 90 percent ownershipinterest.   _All South African imports to the United States would be bannedexcept for certain strategic minerals and publications. The 1986sanctions law banned only agricultural products, coal, textiles,uranium, and military vehicles.   _All U.S. exports to South Africa would be prohibited with theexception of agricultural products, publications and U.S. publicand private assistance.   _The bill bars an American company or vessel from transportingcrude or refined oil to South Africa. Americans also would beforbidden to engage in the production of nuclear material in SouthAfrica.</TEXT></DOC>
