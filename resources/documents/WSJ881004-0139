Sen. Proxmire circulated a new version of legislation he steered through the Senate last April by a vote of 94-2. Staffers said he hoped to win Senate passage of the new bill as early as today, and send it to the House in an eleventh-hour bid to win enactment.    The bill is crafted to avoid the jurisdiction of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and its chairman, Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), which are locked in a battle with the House Banking Committee over a similar measure.    But it was unclear whether the gambit would succeed in reviving the prospects of the bank-powers bill, which have faded as Congress's adjournment has approached. Banking and securities-industry lobbyists have said in recent days that enactment of the bill appears unlikely this year. But few are ready to call it dead with Sen. Proxmire probing for a solution before he retires at the end of this congressional session.    In an attempt to cut Rep. Dingell's panel out of consideration, Sen. Proxmire stripped the banking bill of almost all references to securities laws and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Instead of amending the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which requires separation of the securities and banking industries, the new proposal would amend the Bank Holding Company Act and override portions of Glass-Steagall.    Sen. Proxmire proposed to attach the bank-powers bill to a minor House bill and seek a conference with House members to draft a final measure. He planned to offer a second bill containing some securities-law changes, but its effect would be minimal.    In the House, the bill's substance has been lost in a bitter feud over whether the commerce panel is seizing the Banking Committee's jurisdiction.    The House Banking Committee has approved a bill broadening securities-underwriting powers of banks, but Rep. Dingell's panel has drafted extensive amendments to it, mostly restricting banks' securities activities.    Rep. Dingell was said to have stood his ground in a meeting yesterday with House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand St Germain (D., R.I.) and House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas). Congressional aides said the speaker ignored Rep. St Germain's effort to have his panel's bill taken up on the floor, and urged him to work out his differences with Rep. Dingell's committee. </TEXT></DOC>
