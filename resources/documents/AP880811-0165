The talks raised hopes that Church of England envoy Terry Waiteand two other Britons among 18 foreigners missing and believedkidnapped in Lebanon may be freed. Most of the hostages arebelieved held by pro-Iranian extremists.   ``It does seem there is a turn in the tide of events,'' Waite'scousin, John Waite, said in a TV interview. ``We are very, verycautious. But I think this is a small step along what perhaps is along road toward the release of all the hostages.''   In a separate development, diplomat David Reddaway, the firstBritish envoy to enter Iran in a year, left London and said he willraise the hostage issue with Iranian authorities.   ``I think it is bound to help,'' Reddaway said at HeathrowAirport. ``The main thing I will be able to do is to remind theIranian government ... that we would hope that any government thatcould influence people holding hostages would do so.''   Neither the Iranian Embassy nor Runcie, who left for athree-week vacation in Philadelphia, would comment on thearchbishop's meeting Wednesday night with Iranian envoy MohamedReza Said Mohamedi.   Waite disappeared in Lebanon in January 1987 while trying tosecure the release of American hostages believed held bypro-Iranian extremists. Nine Americans are among the 18 hostages.   Mohamedi, an official on the European desk of the ForeignMinistry in Tehran, arrived in London on Wednesday via Geneva forwhat Waite's family said were supposed to be secret talks.   It was the first known meeting between the spiritual leader ofthe Church of England and an Iranian official since Waite vanished.   ``I believe that everyone who is genuinely concerned about theimprovement of Anglo-Iranian relations and about the Britishhostages in Lebanon will recognize that there are times whenprogress can only be made quietly,'' Runcie said before flying tothe United States.   Meanwhile, a British Broadcasting Corp. Middle Eastcorrespondent, Keith Graves, reported that control of the hostagesheld in Beirut has passed from Lebanese Shiite Moslemfundamentalists to a group of ``hard-line Iranian RevolutionaryGuards.''   Graves said the hard-liners opposed Hashemi Rafsanjani, head ofIran's armed forces, because of his agreement to a cease-fire inits war with Iraq and his ``willingness'' to have the Westernhostages released from Lebanon.   Reddaway planned to spend three weeks assessing whether Britainshould resume a diplomatic presence in Tehran.   Britain withdrew its diplomats a year ago after one was beatenup in an apparent reprisal for the arrest of an Iranian envoy innorthern England on shoplifting charges.   The British Embassy was closed and the ambassador withdrawn in1980 after a siege by revolutionary guards denouncing Britain as aU.S. ally.   The remaining diplomats worked out of the Swedish Embassy. OneIranian envoy remains in Britain.   British-Iranian relations have improved markedly in the past sixweeks.   The Foreign Office, which insisted the government was notinvolved in Runcie's talks, said the catalyst for sending adiplomat back to Tehran was Iran's agreement July 18 to accept aU.N. cease-fire in its war with Iraq.   On the instructions of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Britishofficials insist they will not bargain for the release of Britonsin Lebanon. But Britain is now the only Western European countrywithout diplomats in Tehran.   The other Britons missing in Lebanon are television journalistJohn McCarthy, who was kidnapped April 17, 1986, and teacher BrianKeenan from Northern Ireland, who has been missing since April 11,1986. Keenan holds dual British and Irish nationality.   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, aNew York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claimthey killed him. His body was never found.   The longest held foreign hostage in Lebanon is American TerryAnderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
