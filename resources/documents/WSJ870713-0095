But the resolution may be a toothless gesture; the U.N. probably won't endorse a second measure applying sanctions against the side that breaks the proposed truce.    The Reagan administration has pushed hard for the cease-fire resolution and for sanctions, which would take the form of an international embargo on arms sales to the side that violates the truce.    Washington probably can win reluctant support for sanctions from its allies, Britain and France, who, like the U.S. are among the Security Council's five permanent members. But the other two permanent members, China and the Soviet Union, may perceive that their interests are advanced by a continuation of hostilities. Under U.N. rules, one veto by a permanent member can block a resolution in the 15-member council.    &quot;The first resolution, a cease-fire, is a motherhood issue,&quot; says James Placke, a former State Department official and Mideast expert who now is an international consultant. But, he asks, &quot;Can you get the five permanent members to subscribe to a second (sanctions) resolution? The odds are you can't.&quot;    Thus, what will be done this week with great fanfare -- Secretary of State George Shultz plans to go to the U.N. for the debate -- may be of little lasting value. It will provide President Reagan with diplomatic cover to counter congressional opposition to his plan to provide naval protection for 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. But there is little reason to believe that the cease-fire will be taken seriously without sanctions against the combatant that breaks it.    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is uncomfortable supporting international sanctions. But she likes to support President Reagan when she can. Britain and Iran lately have been entangled in mutual name-calling, with each side expelling the other's diplomats, and London apparently has concluded that diplomacy can't stop Iran's terrorist involvement in Lebanon and elsewhere.    Moreover, Mrs. Thatcher sees broader gains from supporting sanctions. The Soviet Union already supports the cease-fire resolution, and Mrs. Thatcher believes that her actions could nudge Moscow toward accepting a sanctions resolution, re-enforcing a pattern of U.S.-Soviet cooperation that includes other spheres.    Similarly, France's mounting concern over terrorism compels it to support efforts to end the gulf war. Further, it's betting that Iran, not Iraq, which it supports, would be the first to violate the cease-fire and hence be subjected to sanctions.    But persuading the Soviets to support sanctions will be a difficult chore. Vernon Walters, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., recently visited Moscow to lobby for the U.N. resolutions. A senior American official says the conversations &quot;were encouraging on that score,&quot; but the Soviets haven't committed themselves.    With less exposure in the gulf, the Soviets have fewer risks. Continued instability offers them opportunities to increase their prestige by mediating between the parties. Thus, the Soviets could delay action by raising other issues, such as the need to consider the gulf war in the context of broader regional peace issues.    China is even &quot;a larger challenge than the Soviets,&quot; concedes the senior U.S. official. It has a commercial interest to protect as one of the major suppliers of arms to Iran and therefore has little incentive to support a sanctions resolution that could cost it business.    But perhaps more important, it, like the Reagan administration, sees regional issues in superpower terms. In China's case, a relationship with Iran, Moscow's neighbor, is a counterweight to Soviet influence in India, which borders China. &quot;You don't want to gang up on Iran. If you're the Chinese, you want to be seen as neutral or sympathetic,&quot; says consultant Placke.    The permanent Security Council members have carefully crafted the cease-fire resolution to avoid the appearance of ganging up. The cease-fire would cover both the war against oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and the fighting on the ground. In the past, Iraq has balked at U.N. proposals calling for a cease-fire in the tanker war, which it is winning, and Iran has complained about proposed cease-fires in the land war, which Iran is winning. The resolution also calls for creation of a committee to determine the origins of the war -- an Iranian demand (Iraq started the war).    Because of these factors -- and the rarity of having the resolution sponsored by all five permanent members -- both Iran and Iraq might consider the cease-fire. But without the stick of sanctions to back it up, the U.N. resolution may become another casualty of the seven-year conflict. </TEXT></DOC>
