Yeutter told the Senate Agriculture Committee on Thursday that hewas so busy wrapping up his work as U.S. trade representative forPresident Reagan and preparing to become agriculture secretary forPresident Bush that ``it totally disappeared from my attentionscreen.''   Philip Morris, Inc., staged the reception Jan. 18 for Yeutter,saying it wanted to celebrate his appointment as agriculturesecretary.   Federal ethics rules forbid government officials from acceptinganything of value from anyone who could be affected by theofficial's actions.   As trade representative, Yeutter aggressively promoted overseassales of U.S. tobacco products; as agriculture secretary he would beresponsible for policies directly affecting Philip Morris businessinterests.   The reception arrangement was reported Thursday by The WashingtonPost and Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., questioned Yeutter about thepossible conflict of interest during a confirmation hearing.   ``When Philip Morris suggested that they would like to hold somekind of event in my honor because of all the work we had been doingin the international trade arena ... I could see no conflict ofinterest problems in them doing so because I was fully intending togo back to the private sector,'' said Yeutter.   ``When the event was agreed to, it simply did not ring anyconflict of interest bells,'' he said, noting that it was held inthe final hours of Reagan's term. ``You are not going to be causingany conflicts of interest in the final 24 hours of anadministration.''   He said then Bush asked him to be agriculture secretary after hehad accepted Philip Morris' invitation.   ``We probably should have reconsidered because of my expectedcontinuation in government. ... Frankly, I just didn't think aboutit,'' he said.   Yeutter was president of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange from1978 to 1985, when he became trade representative.   Asked about the current FBI investigation of alleged fraud infutures trading at the Merc, Yeutter said he didn't know the probewas under way while he was its president. The FBI began itsundercover investigation of brokers in Yeutter's last year at theexchange.   ``Some complaints surface almost every week of the year and theyare brought before a disciplinary committee,'' Yeutter said. ``Mostare fruitless. Some have validity and sanctions are applied uponthose against whom charges are levied.   ``I was not aware this was a widespread problem,'' he said. ``Iknow no more than what is in the newspapers.''   Yeutter emphasized throughout the hearing the importance ofholding down federal spending in agriculture and finding moreforeign markets for American products.   ``We have to find ways to permit American farmers to earn incomefrom the marketplace and depend less on the federal government,'' hesaid. ``We have had too high a reliance on government by farmers inthis country.''   Yeutter also discussed the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade, saying ``We are not about to abandon any import constraintsin the United States unless there is quid pro quo in othercountries, giving us export opportunities. It's a horse trade.''   On rural development, he said: ``The push and initiative shouldcome from local areas. We can help coordinate and provide technicalassistance'' but he said the federal government does not havebillions of dollars to put into helping farm communities diversify.</TEXT></DOC>
