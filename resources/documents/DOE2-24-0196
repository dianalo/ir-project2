In order to clarify the basic properties of ocean waves, the waveenergy distribution of a wave with respect to the frequency and propagationdirection is represented by the directional spectrum. However, in a coexistingincident and reflected wave field, the directional spectra should bemodified with the phase interaction taken into account. By one method(MBM) proposed in this paper, the directional spectra of incident andreflected waves in a wave field of which the reflection coefficient isknown are separately calculated. By minimizing the Bayesian model informationstandard developed by Akaike, a more appropriate reflection coefficientis obtained. By the other method (EMBM) which is an extended method ofMBM, the directional specta of incident and reflected waves are separatelycalculated, and also the reflection coefficient is estimated. MBM canbe applied for more than four-sensor array, and the estimation precisionis enhanced with a more correct reflection coefficient given. EMBM canbe applied for a large scale, namely, more than six-sensor array, andthe precision is very high. (12 figs, 1 tab, 17 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
