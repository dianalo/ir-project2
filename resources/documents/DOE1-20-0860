They represented at least 5% and 0.7% of the total inositol-labeledlipids in the plasma membrane-rich fractions, respectively, and werepresent in a ratio of about 7:1 (PIP:PIP{sub 2}). In addition, two unidentifiedinositol-labeled compounds, which together were approximately 3% of theinositol-labeled lipids, were found predominantly in the plasma membrane-richfractions and migrated between PIP{sub 2} and PIP. The R/sub f/s of thesecompounds were approximately 0.31 and 0.34 in the solvent system CHCl{sub3}:MeOH:15N NH{sub 4}OH:H{sub 2}O (90:90:7:22) using LK5 plates presoakedin 1% potassium oxalate. These compounds incorporated {sup 32}P/sub i/,({sup 3}H)inositol and were hydrolyzed in mild base. These data suggestedthat they were glycero-phospholipids. Although the compounds did notcomigrate with lysoPIP obtained from bovine brain (R/sub f/ {similar_to}0.35), when endogenous PIP was hydrolyzed to lysoPIP, the breakdown productmigrated in the region of the unidentified inositol lipids.</TEXT></DOC>
