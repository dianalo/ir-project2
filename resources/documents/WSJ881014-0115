The Commerce Department said the merchandise trade deficit swelled to $12.18 billion in August from a revised $9.47 billion in July. Imports, including insurance and freight costs, rose 10.4% to a record $39.72 billion while exports climbed 3.9% to $27.55 billion, also a record.    Economists said one month's unfavorable figures don't alter their expectation that the trade gap will keep shrinking, but they are a reminder that the reduction will be gradual. &quot;The trade deficit is coming down, but doing it slowly,&quot; said Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm.    The deficit, larger than many Wall Street estimates, sent the dollar tumbling on currency markets. The bond market fell at first but largely recovered later, though it finished the day slightly lower. The stock market shrugged off the trade news and climbed modestly.    The dollar was quoted in late New York trading at 127.43 yen, compared with 129.06 a day earlier. It also slid to 1.8155 marks from 1.8353, and its weakness helped the British pound climb to $1.75 from $1.7338.    The August trade report, the last that will be issued before the presidential election, was greeted predictably by the candidates. Vice President George Bush's campaign, which had interpreted July's sharp improvement as evidence of the success of the Reagan administration's economic policies, dismissed the August report as &quot;a small aberration that shouldn't cause anybody tremendous heartburn.&quot; White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater blamed the &quot;volatility of the numbers&quot; and said, &quot;The overall trade deficit has gone down, and we expect this trend to continue.&quot;    But a spokesman for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic candidate, described the report as &quot;more evidence of the failure of the Reagan-Bush trade policy of sitting back and watching the damage accumulate.&quot;    And, in a gibe at his Republican opponent, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic nominee for vice president, added: &quot;During August we exported 950 cars to Japan and imported 178,000 from there.&quot; In a televised debate, Sen. Dan Quayle, Mr. Bush's running mate, had cited exports of U.S.-made Honda cars to Japan as evidence of U.S. economic might.    For the first eight months of the year, the trade gap stands at $92.32 billion, narrowed from $113.41 billion in the first eight months of 1987. Exports rose 28.7% during this period, while imports climbed 9.3%. &quot;We are on target,&quot; said Commerce Secretary William Verity, who said he expects the full-year deficit to be about $30 billion narrower than last year's record $170 billion.    Excluding insurance and freight costs, the August trade gap was $10.56 billion, compared with a revised $8.02 billion in July. Imports totaled $38.11 billion in August, compared with $34.53 billion the month before.    Imports, which fell in July, rose across the board in August. Imports of capital goods and consumer goods rose a particularly strong 14%, and imports of autos and parts climbed 11%. By region, the U.S. imported more from all parts of the world except Western Europe.    Economists said the strong demand for capital goods indicates continuing investment by U.S. businesses in new equipment. Imports of office machinery, electrical machinery and power-generating gear were up substantially.    The strong demand for consumer goods suggests that the slower U.S. economic growth and higher interest rates of recent months haven't weakened consumption enough to damp import demand.    &quot;American consumers are continuing to spend despite the fact that real income is going down,&quot; said Sung Won Sonn, an economist with Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.    Despite a drop in prices, the value of petroleum imports increased 8.2% as volume rose. But economists said the recent drop in petroleum prices should cut the dollar value of these imports in coming months.    Exports of auto parts, capital goods and food rose in August but were partly offset by declines in exports of industrial materials. As in the case of imports, most of the numbers represent reversals of July's export pattern.    The U.S. deficit with Japan widened to $4.75 billion in August from $4.44 billion in July. Imports from Japan climbed 4.2%, while exports rose only 1.2%. In August, the U.S. imported $800 of Japanese goods for every $330 it exported to that country.    The deficit with the newly industrializing economies of Asia -- Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea -- swelled to $3.32 billion from $2.68 billion. These countries have been under pressure from Washington to increase the value of their currencies to help trim their trade surpluses with the U.S. Some economists said there is little hope for any progress in this effort over the next few months.    &quot;I don't think there's much more this administration can do for the rest of the year, so I don't expect any improvements in the trade balance with these nations until perhaps next year,&quot; said Robert Chandross, economist at Lloyds Bank in New York.    The U.S. deficit with Canada narrowed substantially in August, to $498.5 million from $1.12 billion in July, reflecting a sharp improvement in the U.S. auto industry's balance of trade with Canada. The deficit with Western Europe narrowed to $1.39 billion from $2.28 billion as U.S. exports rose and imports fell. The deficit with members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries widened to $1.16 billion from $937.3 million.    Except for the figures on bilateral trade and oil imports, the figures are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.    Before seasonal adjustments, the August trade deficit was $12.74 billion, compared with July's $11.99 billion. Unadjusted exports rose 5.9% to $26.59 billion, while imports rose 6.1% to $39.33 billion.    The seasonally adjusted July trade deficit was previously reported as $9.53 billion.    ---                U.S. Merchandise Trade Deficits   (In billions of U.S. dollars, not seasonally adjusted and including insurance and freight costs)                              Aug.
