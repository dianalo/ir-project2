SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Only about half the adults who have a computerat home actually use it as opposed to nearly three-quarters of allchildren, the Census Bureau reports.   Youngsters use computers for learning and for games, and manychildren are also exposed to the machines in school, said bureaustatistician Robert Kominski, whose survey was released Wednesday.   Even though many adults use computers at work, the home computermay have been bought by one adult for a specific use, and not be ofinterest to others in the home, Kominski suggested.   In addition, many computers were bought ``as learning tools andgame machines for children,'' he said. ``So there probably arequite a few situations in households where children use a computerand not the adults at all.''   The report was based on a survey taken in October 1984, the onlytime the bureau has looked at computer use. The report was delayedbecause of other priorities, he said.   Computer use has skyrocketed from the nearly 7 million homecomputers in use at the time of the survey.   International Data Corp., a Boston-based market research group,estimates that the number of homes with computers reached nearly16.5 million as of last year.   And Electronic Industries Association, a trade group, estimatesthe total at 17.6 million homes as of January.   While it deals with a time when fewer machines were in use, thecensus analysis is the first detailed look at who owns and uses themachines.   Of 221 million Americans aged 3 and over in 1984, more than onein five _ 21.1 percent _ reported using computers in some directway.   _Some 8.2 percent of households (6.9 million) owned a homecomputer.   Ownership was most likely in households with incomes of $50,000or more, 22.9 percent. Only 1.7 percent of households with incomesunder $10,000 had a computer.   People aged 34 to 44 were most likely to own computers. Thosewith children were three times more likely to have a machine thanwere the childless.   _Of the 15 million adults in computer households, 53.3 percentreported using the machine. Use by men was 63.1 percent, comparedto 48.2 percent of women. Usage was highest in the 25 to 34 agegroup.   Adults in the West and Northeast were most likely to have acomputer at home, 10.3 percent and 10.2 percent respectively. Butwesterners were much more likely to use them, 57.9 percent to 49.8percent.   In the Midwest, 8.9 percent of adults had a home computer and54.5 percent of them used it. The rates were 7.7 percent of adultsin the South with a computer and 51.6 percent using it.   _Nearly one-fourth, 24.6 percent of all employed adults, used acomputer at work. Reversing the home pattern, women were morelikely to use them there, 29.0 percent to 21.2 percent.   The highest rate of use was 39.1 percent of women in technicaland support jobs, while the top rate for men was 38.6 percent inadministrative and management positions.   _Among children aged 3 to 17, 15.3 percent had a computer athome, and 74.2 percent of those used it. Of those enrolled inschool, 28 percent reported using computers.   Among youngsters, the study found, boys generally use computersmore than girls.   ``If you want to risk saying anything is a socioculturaldifference at this time, that's certainly where it lies,'' Kominskisaid. ``People who study computer games find boys use these thingsmuch more than girls do, they go to video parlors more, and theyuse computers more at home and school too.''   In school, the highest usage was in the Midwest where 33.9percent of students said they had computers. The rate was 30.8percent in the Northeast, 29.4 percent in the West and 21.3 percentin the South.</TEXT></DOC>
