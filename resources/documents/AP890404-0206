(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The first battles following any majorchange in the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 ruling legalizing abortionprobably would erupt in Louisiana and 14 other states that stillhave anti-abortion laws on the books.   The laws now are unenforceable because of the Roe vs. Wadedecision, but there is debate over whether they could take effectif the high court ever overturned the 1973 ruling. The issue wouldhead immediately for the courts.   Louisiana's law says that if the high court ever reverses the1973 decision, the state's anti-abortion rules go back into force.Idaho and Illinois have similar laws.   ``Our law is broad and general and says the state can regulateabortions totally within limits of the U.S. Supreme Courtdecisions,'' said Jo Anne Lavert, a staff attorney for AttorneyGeneral William Guste.   However, Democratic state Rep. Woody Jenkins, who has writtenmost of Louisiana's anti-abortion laws since 1973, said he doubtedthe laws could take effect again and predicted a new law would haveto be passed.   Daniel Stier, an assistant attorney general in Wisconsin, whichhas an anti-abortion law on the books from before the 1973 ruling,said he was not sure what would happen.   ``Until we get a decision, it's so speculative it would be awaste of time to guess what the effect would be on Wisconsin law,''he said. ``There are an infinite number of possibilities of whatmight happen to the laws on our books.''   Stier said he would advise district attorneys not to beginprosecuting women for violating state law if the Supreme Courtreversed Roe vs. Wade.   Walter Turner, an assistant state attorney general in Alabama,said his office could not speak specifically about the state's 1852anti-abortion law unless the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade.But he said there had been previous cases in which old state lawswent back into effect after the Supreme Court reversed itself.   The other states with anti-abortion laws pre-dating Roe vs. Wadeare Arkansas, Arizona, Connectituct, Delaware, Michigan,Mississippi, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, South Dakota and WestVirginia. An attempt to repeal New Hampshire's law has passed theHouse and is now before the Senate.   Louisiana officials contend the anti-abortion law the stateenacted in reaction to Roe vs. Wade is the most stringent in thenation.   Before 1973, abortion was a criminal offense in Louisiana.Anyone giving an abortion could get up to 10 years in prison athard labor.   Since then, Louisiana has passed many anti-abortion laws thathave been found unconstitutional by the courts. Among theprovisions thrown out were rules forbidding abortions in the firstthree months of pregnancy, requiring doctors to test the fetus tosee if it could live, mandating parental consent for minors andrequiring abortions to be performed only at hospitals by physicians.   The only two provisions upheld prohibit public financing forabortions and require that parents of minors be notified of plansfor an abortion.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 9</NOTE></DOC>
