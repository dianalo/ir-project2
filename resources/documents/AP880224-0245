The three-day session will be the first such conference sinceWorld War II.   Military, ethnic, environmental and political disputes marrelations among the six.   Ministers from NATO allies Greece and Turkey, Warsaw Pactmembers Bulgaria and Romania and non-aligned Yugoslavia and Albaniaarrived in Belgrade Tuesday.   At a meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria, on Monday, Prime MinisterAndreas Papandreou of Greece and Bulgarian leader Todor Zhivkovsaid the Balkan conference should be a forum for cooperation.   ``We hope that this meeting will turn into an institution,'' theofficial Bulgarian news agency BTA quoted Papandreou as saying in adinner speech. He suggested that such meetings be held every twoyears.   BTA quoted Zhivkov as saying the conference first ``shoulddiscuss the questions that unite us.   ``We do not underestimate the contradictions and thedifficulties between the Balkan states, but they must continue tobe discussed on a bilateral and multilateral basis.''   Although the conference is expected to focus largely oneconomic, scientific and cultural cooperation, festering issues areexpected to be raised.   Bulgaria and Greece are likely to raise the possibility ofestablishing a nuclear-free zone in the Balkans, a proposal opposedby Turkey.   Turkish and Greek diplomats, however, have said they won't raisethe dispute over Cyprus, which is divided by forces loyal to eachnation.   The Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug has reported that Bulgariaplans to propose a special Balkan conference on environmentalissues, apparently to take Romania to task for pollution on theBulgarian-Romanian border area.   One potential problem apparently was resolved Tuesday whenBulgaria and Turkey signed a protocol on good neighborly relations.   A Turkish diplomat had said earlier his delegation planned toraise the issue of Bulgaria's ethnic Turkish minority at theconference. Bulgaria's estimated 1 million ethnic Turks were forcedby the government to adopt Bulgarian names as part of a``Bulgarization campaign.''   The protocol was seen as a clear indication that the twoneighbors seek to normalize relations after years of discord.   Ethnic tensions also strain relations between Albania andYugoslavia, which has a large Albanian minority in the southernprovince of Kosovo.   ``There are many problems that we must review, concerning bothbilateral cooperation and cooperation among the Balkan countries ingeneral, in order to create an atmosphere of confidence,'' AlbanianForeign Minister Reis Malile said in a television interview uponhis arrival in Belgrade.   Malile is the highest-ranking Albanian to visit Yugoslavia in 40years. Albania strongly condemned Yugoslavia's decision in 1948 tobreak with the Soviet loc, but 20 years later Albania followed suit.</TEXT></DOC>
