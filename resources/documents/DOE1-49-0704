Historically, atmospheresampling aboard nuclear submarines has shown contaminants. Other contaminantsinclude: ozone, (major source: by-product of the ESP's); freon, (majorsource: ship's refrigeration system and air-conditioning plants); hydrogen,(major source: ship's batteries); carbon dioxide, (major source: humanrespiration); and carbon monoxide, (major source: cigarette smoking).Contaminants tested for but not found were elemental mercury and asbestos.Considering that asbestos is no longer recommended for use, secondaryto its carcinogenic and co-carcinogenic qualities, fibrous glass hasbecome a common substitute. One use of fibrous glass aboard the Ohioclass submarine is acoustic and thermal insulation around perforatedducting, which runs through many exposed, high traffic spaces, i.e. crew'sberthing spaces. Although the raw fibrous glass is protected from theenvironment it is possible, through natural wear and tear of the housingmaterial, that at some time the insulating material may become exposedand mechanically aerosolized. Obvious questions then are: a) do submarineaerosols contain fiber glass, and b) are there health hazards relatedto the inhalation of these fibers. This paper reviews the current knowledgeas to the health hazard of exposure.</TEXT></DOC>
