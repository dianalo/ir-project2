Lotus, which remains primarily a single-product company, said first-quarter net income rose 34% to $18.3 million, or 40 cents a share, from $13.7 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier. The Cambridge, Mass.-based software publisher had sales of $117.3 million, up 38% from $84.8 million.    Microsoft, meanwhile, riding strong domestic and international demand for a wide range of new and older products, reported a 95% increase in net for the fiscal third quarter, ended March 31. Microsoft's net jumped to $37.3 million, or 67 cents a share, from $19.1 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 65% to $161.8 million from $98.4 million.    Microsoft's much faster growth shows how the Redmond, Wash.-based company has capitalized on its large investment in new products, while Lotus has yet to garner significant returns from similar outlays. Both companies spent between $18 million and $20 million each on research and development in the recent quarter, but Microsoft brought out new products and Lotus didn't, said Richard Sherlund, software industry analyst for Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.    &quot;Microsoft has done a much better job in delivering new products to market than Lotus,&quot; Mr. Sherlund said. &quot;They seem to get more bang from their Randamp;D line than Lotus.&quot;    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Microsoft closed at $54.25 a share, down 50 cents. Lotus shares fell $1 to $23.50.    Jon Shirley, Microsoft's president and chief operating officer, said demand for the company's products had been especially brisk overseas. International sales accounted for 48% of Microsoft's revenue in the period, he said. Microsoft's international retail sales grew 90% in the quarter over a year earlier, added Mr. Sherlund.    Jim Manzi, Lotus's president and chief executive officer, said Lotus also recorded &quot;significant&quot; gains in its international markets, as well as in its information services business. Demand remained strongest, however, for Lotus's popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet program. The company said last month an upgraded version of the program would be delayed for shipment until the fourth quarter. The company had previously planned to ship the revised program in June.    Both Microsoft and Lotus built their fortunes on the strength of blockbuster programs: Lotus, with its 1-2-3 spreadsheet, and Microsoft, with its MS-DOS operating system for personal computers. But according to Mr. Sherlund, Microsoft, which now depends on its operating system programs for less than a quarter of its revenue, has fanned out and penetrated other software markets. Lotus, though, still relies on spreadsheet products for about 75% of its sales, the analyst said.    ---   David Stipp contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
