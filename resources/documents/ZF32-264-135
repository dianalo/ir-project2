 Information Engineering, which can put together asmall system, appears later under Atex Add-ons, which appeared to be itsfocus this year.andP;  That left only Abacus, showing its PC system running Indianscripts and English; Krohm, returning to the show in the IBM booth after along absence; and LaserMaker, which probably could have been included withthe big systems in view of some of its sales in the UK and other parts of theworld.andM;One company we should mention in passing is PC Graphics, which demonstratedthe Monotype/GB Techniques Mentor system that it sells in the U.S.andP;  Wecovered the latest developments on the Mentor front at Drupa, so the mainnews from PC Graphics was that it is committed to a strong effort to sell thesystem in the U.S.andP;  It expects to get a significant boost from IBM inpromoting the system, such as at IBM-sponsored seminars.andM;We also got another chance to see the Linotype LinoPress system that waspreviewed at Drupa, but there wasn't anything new to report there, either.andO;The system is still far from complete, with first deliveries expected in1991.andP;  It still looks quite impressive, based on Macintoshes linked to Sunserviers.andM;Abacus shows dummying softwareandM;Abacus, which had made its international debut in the Linotype booth atDrupa, showed its first effort to link its database facilities with softwarefor ad layout.andP;  As we mentioned at Drupa, the system specializes in handlingIndian scripts, but it also supports English.andM;As with the editorial pagination program shown at Drupa, ad layout is basedon page grids that can differ from page to page.andP;  It alo requires a lot ofmanual assistance.andP;  The user types in the name of the ad, the page number,the date, the number of columns, the depth and the vertical position.andM;Ads appear on the dummy for the page to which they are assigned, and as closeto the specified position as possible.andP;  There is no provision forautomatically placing ads in any user-defined arrangement, such as a pyramidor squared off.andP;  Once placed on a page, ads can be moved manually.andP;  It alsois possible to change the size of an ad on the page and have the changereflected in the database.andM;The system provides a list of the ads on each page with the name, page,edition, date, etc.andM;The operator has some useful ad-creation capabilities while working with thepage, including the ability to type directly into the ad.andP;  Also available arethe standard formats for drawing boxes, specifying times and importing TIFFgraphics.andP;  To import an image, the user indicates the number of columns thatthe image is to fill.andP;  The system then scales it to fit the proper width andreports the number of lines it will fill.andM;Pages can be printed full size or reduced.andP;  There also is a facility formaking up stories modularly, squaring off the columns, and printing them.andM;In addition, Abacus showed automatic insertion of continuation lines, formatsfor generating crossheads within news stories and a split screen that enablesmoving text from the second or third window into the main file, but not theability to edit in any of the windows.andM;Abacus supports automatic backup of all files to a second disk by specifyinga path.andM;Krohm returns to the show circuitandM;Krohm International, which used to demonstrate its composition systemregularly at trade shows, returned to the show circuit after an absence ofseveral years.andP;  It hadn't been out of business in that period, though.andP;  As wehad reported during those times, Krohm had been focusing on its premiercustomer--American City's Business Journal, which accounts for 21 of its 61system installations.andP;  The Business Journal has one owner operating differenteditorial, production and accounting systems in its various locations.andP;  Thenext largest customer is Metropolitan City Papers, based in Minneapolis, withnine systems.andM;These two customers produce weekly tabloids, averaging between 48 and 96pages per issue, plus a few annual reports.andP;  The other 31 customers includecommercial typographers, small weekly newspapers, and operations such as theHong Kong Bible Society.andP;  As in the past, the target applications are galleycomposition, magazine/newspaper pagination and book pagination.andM;The major change since we last saw Krohm is its move to new platforms.andO;Earlier, the system ran only on Texas Instruments hardware, with an option torun within a PC equipped with a TI processor board.andP;  The galley compositionprogram has been ported to run under MS-DOS and under Unix.andP;  Magazinepagination software, which is based on placement of elements by x/ycoordinates, is headed in the same direction but is only 80% finished,according to the company's president, Gary Krohm.andP;  The book program stillruns only under the TI operating system.andM;Krohm is building user interfaces for Windows 3.0, Open Look and Motif.andM;Demonstrating in the IBM booth, Krohm showed its latest software.andP;  It hasn'tchanged much in functionality from its earlier days, but it can now importPostScript files as graphics.andP;  It also uses an Eicon board to provide aPostScript preview of composed jobs.andP;  Running on Sun Microsystems Unixworkstations, the program uses News or Display PostScript for the preview.andM;The composition program is code driven.andP;  Text is edited in a window, afterwhich handamp;j can be initiated by command.andP;  Bistream fonts are used for thepreview.andM;Krohm has added substantially to its instruction manual and is planning tooffer video-based training.andM;The basic program costs $895, not including output drivers, which cost $495.andO;Video training will be priced at $395, as will the first 30 minutes oftelephone support; after that, telephone support costs $2 a minute.andP;  Acontract providing unlimited telephone support and bug fixes costs $2,400 peryear.andM;Gary Krohm remains president of the firm.andP;  Graeme E. B. Gibson, the directorof marketing, has extensive experience in data processing and management withsmall businesses and Fortune 500 companies.andP;  He served as director oftraining on Computer Training Corporation's office automation project atKennedy Space Center.andP;  John J. Gowans, the director of development, has spentthe past 10 years on Unix- and C-based projects, the last four involvingelectronic publishing.andM;LaserMaker previews new releaseandM;LaserMaker showed some of the new features in its version 2.3 software,scheduled for release in August.andP;  Among these enhancements are a utility formodifying the spelling and hyphenation dictionary, the ability to mixlanguages in the same story, support for any number of spot colors in a job,greeking of text on a frame basis (rather than the entire page), a provisionfor automatically recording the original version of each story for legalreasons, and a function for deleting all of the text on a page when the pageis deleted.andM;Other new features include the ability to mark multiple stories to be actedon, an indication of undermatter in number of lines and in picas and points,and falicilities for importing TIFF files plus cropping and scaling of TIFFand EPSF files.andP;  There also are user scripts for specifying functions.andM;Camex interface.andP;  LaserMaker also showed sample pages incorporating displayads produced on a Camex breeze at the Home News in New Brunswick, NJ.andP;  Textgenerated on a DEC TMS-UU editorial systems is being merged with Breeze adson pages from LaserMakerd.andP;  The ads aren't displayed on the screen yet.andP;  Whenthe news portion of a page has been finished and the page is sent for output,the system looks for the ads for that page.andP;  If the ad isn't ready yet, thepage isn't typeset until a predefined time elapses.andP;  If he ad still isn'tready when the deadline arrives, the page is output with a label identifyingthe missing ad.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
