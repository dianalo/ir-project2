Imperial Oil, Canada's largest oil company, is 69.6% owned by Exxon Corp.    The purchase includes all of United Canso's Canadian interests in proven and probable natural gas and crude oil reserves and undeveloped properties, Esso Resources said. Estimated proven gross reserves are about 160 billion cubic feet of gas and six million barrels of oil and oil-like liquids, it said. The transaction doesn't include certain non-operating assets in Canada and the U.S., it added.    In April, United Canso was placed in receivership by Royal Bank of Canada because it wasn't able to repay about C$157.8 million of long-term debt. </TEXT></DOC>
