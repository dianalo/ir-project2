The statement of policy strongly encourages eachstate nonmember bank to have an annual external auditing program performedby an independent auditor, and states that, although not required, a bankwith an annual audit of its financial statements by an independent publicaccountant would generally be considered to have a satisfactory externalauditing program. Alternatives for an acceptable annual external auditingprogram are also explained. Newly insured banks will usually be expectedto commit to obtain an audit of their financial statements by an independentpublic accountant annually for at least the first three years after depositinsurance is granted.

(53 FR 12817, April 19, 1988). The proposed statement of policyencouraged each state nonmember bank to have an annual external audit ofits financial statements by an independent certified public accountingfirm. Newly insured banks would generally be expected to commit to obtainsuch an audit by an independent public accountant annually for at leastthe first three years after deposit insurance is granted. In troubled banksituations, the administrative orders issued by the FDIC might requirethat an audit of the bank's financial statements be performed where certainconditions exist. Banks were also requested to submit copies of the auditor'sreports to the appropriate FDIC regional office as soon as possible upontheir receipt by the bank. The proposed statement of policy was similarin many respects to the present policy of the Office of the Comptrollerof the Currency for national banks (Banking Circular-190, March 18, 1985).In proposing a statement of policy on external auditing, the FDIC statedthat it sought to improve bankers' awareness of the importance of an independentexternal auditing program for the financial soundness of banks. In theFDIC's view, a strong internal auditing function combined with an annualexternal auditing program performed by an independent auditor substantiallylessens the risk that a bank will not detect potentially serious problems.The large number of financial institutions experiencing financial difficultiesas a result of fraud, insider abuse and mismanagement in recent years hasmade an external auditing program even more important. The FDIC's examination staff has been criticizing banks that lack an adequateinternal auditing function for many years, and has long encouraged independentexternal auditing programs. Many banks now supplement their internal auditingprograms by engaging independent public accountants to perform externalaudits of their financial statements. In addition, many banks whose financialstatements are not audited have established other types of external auditingprograms either on their own or to comply with the requirements of theirstate chartering authority.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>The FDIC's received 109 comment letters on its proposed statement of policy.Nine were from national banks, seven were from banking/thrift or accounting/auditingtrade groups, one was from a state banking department, five were from bankholding companies, nine were from firms that perform auditing work, andone was from an attorney with a banking practice. The remaining 77 writtencomments primarily came from smaller state-chartered banks, and 64 of thesewere from banks in Wisconsin, Nebraska, and Florida. Since the lettersfrom these three states were quite similar, it appears that a nonaccountingfirm that performs auditing work in each state may have encouraged itsclient banks to comment to the FDIC.Of the 109 comments received, 17 were supportive of the statement of policylargely as proposed, and 15 could be characterized as generally opposed.In addition, 33 objected to what they perceived to be a strong and exclusiveemphasis on audits of financial statements by independent certified publicaccountants (CPAs), but they seemed to be generally supportive of a policywhere external auditing programs conducted by independent auditors wouldbe acceptable. The remaining 44 commented on specific points of the proposalwithout indicating a view on the statement of policy as a whole.Giving due consideration to the comments received, the FDIC has decidedto proceed with the implementation of the statement of policy after makingcertain revisions to the policy as it was originally proposed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Changes From the Proposal</ITAG>Many of the commenters appeared to misunderstand the intent of the statementof policy and expressed concern that the FDIC was in reality requiringall state nonmember banks to obtain annual external audits of their financialstatements by independent certified public accountants. To alleviate thismisunderstanding and the resulting apprehension, the FDIC has adjustedthe title and rearranged the text of the statement of policy to more clearlyreflect its objective of having all state nonmember banks establish annualexternal auditing programs whether it be by CPAs or other qualified independentparties. Nevertheless, since auditing work performed by nonaccounting firmsdoes not have to satisfy any nationally recognized auditing standards noris there any universally recognized method of enforcing ethical conductby nonaccounting firms, the FDIC continues to encourage an audit of a bank'sfinancial statements by a public accountant to provide a recognized productwhich the bank and the FDIC may generally assume meets minimum professionalstandards. External auditing work performed by nonaccounting firms mayprovide excellent reviews for a bank, but when using these firms, a bankmust be very cognizant of the auditing work it is getting, the cost, andwhether the work fully meets the bank's needs.Some commenters appear to have had difficulty with the format and clarityof the proposed statement of policy. For that reasons, captions have beenadded throughout the policy to assist in finding the provisions of particularinterest and several paragraphs have been reworded for improved readerunderstanding. As requested by numerous commenters, we have added AppendixA consisting of definitions of the terms used in the statement of policy.Several commenters expressed the view that banks with strong internal auditingprocedures should be relieved of the responsibility of maintaining an externalauditing program. However, the FDIC believes that both an internal auditingfunction and an external auditing program complement one another and bothshould be maintained to assist a bank in operating in a safe and soundmanner. Paragraph 2 of the statement has been revised to indicate thatregardless of the strength of a bank's internal auditing procedures, theFDIC considers an external auditing program to be an important and necessaryaddition to a bank's control environment.Several comments were made that an audit by an independent public accountantprimarily focuses on the fairness of the financial statement presentation.Respondents suggested that an audit of a bank's financial statements shouldnot relieve the bank's audit committee or board of directors of the responsibilityof reviewing whether the audit provided sufficient coverage of the bank'srisk areas. Accordingly, paragraph 3 has been revised to encourage thecommittee or board to review their bank's particular needs annually todetermine if auditing procedures beyond those included in the scope ofthe planned external auditing program for the year are necessary for thatspecific year or several years to cover especially high-risk areas of thebank. In addition, since several letters mentioned the role of the auditcommittee, paragraph 3 also encourages all state nonmember banks to establishan audit committee consisting, if possible, entirely of outside directors.This recommendation was also made for all public companies in the October1987 Report of the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting(``Treadway Commission''), and Appendix A provides a description of theduties and responsibilities of this committee.Many respondents expressed their concern that FDIC field examiners wouldenforce this policy as though it were a regulation. For this reason, wehave specifically added a new paragraph 5 stating that examiners will notautomatically comment negatively on a bank that does not have an annualaudit of its financial statements by an independent public accountant.Nonetheless, examiners will review a bank's external auditing program aspart of their regular examination of the bank and, using their judgmentand discretion, determine whether it adequately covers the risk areas ofthat particular bank. One commenter discussed the similarities between ``licensed public accountants''and ``certified public accountants,'' and suggested that work by both beequally acceptable. Approximately 39 jurisdictions recognize and license``public accountants'' to examine financial statements on the same basisas CPAs, and these jurisdictions hold them to identical standards of technicalcompetence and independence as CPAs. Thus, the policy has been revisedto encourage each bank to adopt an annual audit of its financial statementsby an independent public accountant without specifying that the accountantmust be ``certified.'' As a result of the revision of the statement of policy to emphasize externalauditing programs, paragraph 6 has been revised to include a statementthat a bank with an annual audit of its financial statements by an independentpublic accountant would generally be considered to have a satisfactoryexternal auditing program. Several commenters indicated that the preparation of a bank's Reports ofCondition and Income (Call Reports) by a public accountant would not generallybe performed as part of an audit of its financial statements and to doso would involve additional auditing costs. For that reason, paragraph7 has been revised to explain that the bank may, but does not have to,make use of the audited financial statements in its preparation of thosereports. The alternatives to an audit of a bank's financial statements by a publicaccountant were not sufficiently outlined in the proposal according tomany respondents. For that reason, a separate section on acceptable alternativesto an audit of a bank's financial statements is included beginning withparagraph 8. Many bankers mentioned that the ``directors' examination'' and the so-called``engagement audit'' or ``operational audit'' performed by nonaccountingfirms provided good external auditing coverage for their bank, and suggestedthat the FDIC should permit these external auditing programs under theproposed statement of policy. As previously mentioned, it was not the FDIC'sintention to preclude banks from making use of such audits. Hence, paragraph9 clarifies the FDIC's position that external auditing programs may becarried out by nonaccounting firms as well as independent public accountants.In addition, paragraph 8 of the statement of policy describing alternativesto an audit of a bank's financial statement by a public accountant hasbeen revised to include the directors' examination. An ``engagement audit''or an ``operational audit'' may also be acceptable under the definitionof ``directors' examination'' in Appendix A. Nevertheless, there are sowidely accepted national standards for the specific procedures that mustbe performed in a director's examination or in the ``audits'' mentioned.The audit committee or board of directors of any bank that uses one ofthese alternative programs must carefully review the procedures that willbe performed to assure that the bank's high risk areas have been adequatelytested. Due to another commenter's suggestion, the report on the balance sheethas also been added as an alternative in paragraph 8. The procedures involved,while limited, are performed under generally accepted auditing standardsand are generally less costly than an audit of financial statements. Paragraph 14 has been substantially revised as a result of several commentsto clarify that the scope of a subsidiary bank's external auditing programmay be explained in terms of its relationship to the consolidated group.Where the group has an audit of its consolidated financial statements byan independent public accountant (i.e., the financial statements of thesubsidiary banks are consolidated with the financial statements of theparent company), the subsidiary banks would not be expected to have individualaudits of their financial statements as well under this statement of policy.In response to a comment letter, paragraph 15 on troubled banks has beenexpanded to indicate that an FDIC administrative order may require a bankto notify the regional office of the time and date of any meeting betweenmanagement and the auditor at which auditing findings are to be presentedso that a representative of the FDIC may be present if the regional officeso desires.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Comments  </ITAG>In addition to comments on the policy statement that resulted in changes,the FDIC received and considered other comments on the April proposal. The vast majority of the respondents discussed the cost burden of an auditof a bank's financial statements by a public accountant as the primaryreason for their opposition to the statement of policy. The comments seemedto mistakenly assume that the statement of policy was requiring all banksto have audits of their financial statements and that these audits mustbe performed by a large national CPA firm, which is not correct. The FDICrealizes that an external auditing program represents a cost to a bank,but auditors with banking experience that may have a local or regionalbusiness are available, and the benefits derived from their suggestionsmay ultimately exceed the cost of the auditing services performed. Eachbank is urged to consider proposals from more than one auditor and to selectthe one that will provide the services desired at the most reasonable cost. Many respondents indicated that they did not believe that the audit committeeor board of directors should be required to generate a list of the reasonswhy they chose not to engage an independent auditor, and one commenterstated that the committee or board should not be expected to record inits minutes an item on which no action was taken. This latter argumenthas no basis since the minutes should reflect all items considered by thecommittee or board, whether or not specific action was authorized. TheFDIC does not expect each bank to record a list of all possible benefitsfrom an audit of its financial statements in its minutes. On the otherhand, the FDIC does not expect a bank to make a perfunctory statement annuallythat the cost of an audit of the bank's financial statements is prohibitivewithout investigating and weighing the possible benefits to that particularbank in view of its circumstances that year. When the issue being consideredby the audit committee or board is the scope of the external auditing program,some action should always be recorded. After evaluating the costs and benefitsof the alternatives, the bank should decide what form of external auditingprogram is most suitable for adoption and note this decision in its minutes. Some commenters pointed out that audits of financial statements do notprevent bank failures, and that some troubled banks have had a historyof annual audits. Statistics from the June 1988 Report of Condition revealthat the 1987 financial statements of approximately 65 percent of all bankshad been subject to an audit; however, a review of failed bank recordsshows that little more than one-third of failed banks had audits of theirfinancial statements within two years prior to failure. Auditors are notresponsible for predicting future conditions or events, but they shouldevaluate whether there is substantial doubt about a bank's ability to continueas a going concern for a reasonable period of time. In addition, the auditshould be designed to provide reasonable assurance of detecting materialerrors and irregularities even though the characteristics of irregularitiesoften make them difficult to detect.  Some respondents complained that accounting firms sometimes send largelyinexperienced personnel to audit bank clients. As with any other productor service that a bank buys, it should select the best available auditingservices at the best cost. The policy does not suggest that only largenational firms should be engaged. Regional or local firms should be consideredbecause they may provide a better service at a lower cost for the bank. Several comment letters stated that an audit requirement would create anotherbank regulator, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and thatbanks should not be controlled by this private rule-making body. AlthoughFASB has no authority over the setting of auditing standards, these commentersfail to realize that banks are already subject to FASB pronouncements whetheror not the FDIC adopts a statement of policy regarding external auditingprograms. All banks must submit quarterly Call Reports to the federal bankingagencies and generally accepted accounting principles as established byFASB (and its predecessors) form the foundation for the Call Report instructions. The suggestion was made by several commenters that this policy should havesome threshold by size or examination rating in order to exempt very smallbanks or those with good ratings. Since most of the banks that have alreadyestablished external auditing programs are larger institutions, an exemptionbased on size would defeat the purpose of the statement of policy. As forbanks with good ratings, an adequate external auditing program helps toensure that such banks remain fundamentally sound.  The fear that submitting external auditors' reports to the FDIC will bea disincentive to the regular examination of banks was suggested by certainrespondents. The FDIC has no plans to change its current policy on examinationfrequency as a result of information obtained from external auditing programs,but plans to use the information obtained from the reports by bank externalauditors to assist in the maintenance of the safety and soundness of banks. Other comments that were evaluated and not adopted include: FDIC examinersshould review all audit workpapers to see if the external auditing workwas adequate; the policy statement should require (rather than request)that all reports by external auditors be submitted to the FDIC; and externalauditors' reports should remain at the bank for review during the nextexamination rather than being sent to the FDIC for immediate review. Othercomments were made but were not within the scope of this statement of policy. The text of the statement of policy follows:  1. In view of its interest in the financial soundness of banks and thebanking system, the FDIC believes that a strong internal auditing functioncombined with a well-planned <T3>external auditing program</T3> \1\<NOTE/> substantially lessens the risk that a bank will not detectpotentially serious problems. An external auditing program is a set ofprocedures designed to test and evaluate high <T3>risk areas</T3> of a bank's business which are performed by an <T3>independent</T3> auditor who may or may not be a <T3>public accountant.</T3> The failure to detect and correct potentiallyserious problems increases the risk a bank poses to the FDIC's insurancefund. A strong internal auditing function establishes the proper controlenvironment and promotes accuracy and efficiency in a bank's operations.An external auditing program complements this function by providing anobjective outside the view of the bank's operations.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Terms defined in Appendix A are italicized the first timethey appear in this statement of policy.  2. Regardless of the strength of a bank's internal auditing procedures,the FDIC believes that an external auditing program should be consideredby a bank's board of directors as part of the cost of operating a bankin a safe and sound manner. An external auditing program assists the bank'sboard of directors in safeguarding assets and identifying risks inherentin its operation. In addition, an external auditing program may tend toassist directors in the event of litigation on whether an institution'sboard has exercised reasonable care in protecting the assets of the bank.Thus, the FDIC urges all state nonmember banks to establish and maintaina sound external auditing program.  3. The FDIC strongly encourages the board of directors of each state nonmemberbank to establish an <T3>audit committee</T3> consisting, if possible, entirely of <T3>outside directors.</T3> The audit committee or board of directors ofeach state nonmember bank generally should analyze the extent of the externalauditing coverage needed by the bank annually. They should determine whetherthe bank's needs will best be met by an <T3>audit</T3> of its <T3>financial statements</T3> or by an acceptable alternative (describedin paragraphs 8 and 9 below). When selecting the scope of the planned externalauditing program for the year, the committee or board should ensure thatthe program will provide sufficient substantive external coverage of thebank's risk areas and any other areas of potential concern, such as compliancewith applicable laws and regulations.  If not, additional external auditing procedures conducted by an independentauditor may be appropriate for a specific year or several years to coverparticularly high risk areas of the bank. The decisions resulting fromthese deliberations should be recorded in the committee's or board's minutes. 4. If the audit committee or board of directors of a bank, after due consideration,determines not to engage an independent public accountant to conduct anannual audit of the bank's financial statements (or whose parent holdingcompany's consolidated financial statements are not audited), the reasonsfor the committee's or board's conclusion to use one of the acceptablealternatives or to have no external auditing program should be documentedin its minutes. In the evaluation, the committee or board generally shouldconsider not only the cost of an annual audit of the bank's financial statements,but also the potential benefits.  5. A review of both a bank's internal and external auditing programs hasbeen and will continue to be a part of the FDIC's examination procedures.FDIC examiners will review the nature of each bank's external auditingprogram in conjunction with the risk areas perceived in that particularbank's business and operations, and they will exercise their judgment anddiscretion in evaluating the adequacy of a bank's external auditing program.Examiners will not automatically comment negatively to the board of directorsof a bank with an otherwise satisfactory external auditing program merelybecause it does not engage an independent public accountant to performan audit of its financial statements.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Audit by an Independent Public Accountant  </ITAG>6. The FDIC strongly encourages each state nonmember bank to adopt an externalauditing program that includes an annual audit of its financial statementsby an independent public accountant. A bank that does so would generallybe considered to have a satisfactory external auditing program. An externalaudit of a bank's financial statements benefits management by asssistingin the establishment of the accounting and operating policies, internalcontrols, internal auditing programs, and management information systemsnecessary to ensure the fair presentation of these statements. An auditalso assists boards of directors in fulfilling their fiduciary responsibilitiesand provides them greater assurance that financial reports are accurateand provide adequate disclosure.  7. An audit of a bank's financial statements performed by the independentpublic accountant as of a quarter-end date when the Reports of Conditionand Income are prepared is preferable and would permit the bank to usethe audited financial statements in the preparation and/or subsubsequentreview of those reports. A bank may also find it more cost effective tobe audited during accounting firms' less busy periods. The independentpublic accountant chosen should be experienced in auditing banks and knowledgeableabout banking regulations in order to provide the bank with the most effectiveservice.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Alternatives to an Audit by a Public Accountant  </ITAG>8. The FDIC recognizes that a bank's audit committee or board of directorsmay determine that the external auditing program that will best meet itsindividual needs for that particular year will be other than an audit ofits financial statements by an independent public accountant. The committeeor board, after a full review of alternative and/or supplemental approachesfor an adequate independent external auditing program, may decide on awell-planned <T3>directors' examination</T3>, an independent analysis of internal controlsor other areas, a <T3>report on the balance sheet</T3>, or specified auditing proceduresby an independent auditor. If the bank has an outside auditing firm thatis simply obtaining confirmations of deposits and loans, for example, thecommittee or board should normally expand the scope of the auditing workperformed to include additional procedures to test the bank's high riskareas.    9. Nonaccounting firms with bank auditing experience and expertise thatare independent of the bank are available in some geographic locations.They may provide acceptable directors' examinations, analyses, or specifiedauditing work at a reasonable cost. In some instances, these firms' servicesinclude nonauditing work which enables them to provide suggestions on complianceissues and operational efficiencies. Depending upon the expertise of thefirm and the scope of the engagement, these nonaccounting firms may bean appropriate choice for an external auditing program.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Newly Insured Banks  </ITAG>10. The FDIC believes that an adequate external auditing program performedby an independent auditor should be an integral part of the safe and soundmanagement of a bank. Thus, applicants for deposit insurance coverage afterthe effective date of this statement of policy will generally be expectedto commit their bank to obtain an audit of their financial statements byan independent public accountant annually for at least the first threeyears after deposit insurance coverage is granted.\2\<NOTE/> The FDIC may determine on a case-by-case basis that an independentaudit of financial statements is unnecessary where an applicant can demonstratethat the benefits derived from such an external audit will be substantiallyprovided by other outside sources, or where the applicant is owned by anothercompany and will undergo an audit performed by an independent public accountingfirm as part of an audit of the consolidated financial statements of itsparent company. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Operating non-FDIC insured institutions should also notethat the FDIC expects, unless waived in writing by the FDIC, any applicantfor insurance with more than $50 million in assets to have an audit ofits financial statements prior to submitting an application, and requeststhat a copy of the auditor's report be included as part of the application.The FDIC may require such an audit, on a case-by-case basis, for applicantswith assets of $50 million or less. Refer to the June 9, 1987 Statementof Policy Regarding Applications for Federal Deposit Insurance by OperatingNon-FDIC Insured Institutions, as amended June 24, 1987.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Notification and Submission of Reports  </ITAG>11. Whether currently or newly insured, the FDIC requests each state nonmemberbank that undergoes any external auditing work, regardless of the scopeof the work, to furnish a copy of any reports by the public accountantor other external auditor, including any management letters, to the appropriateFDIC regional office as soon as possible after their receipt by the bank. 12. In addition, the FDIC requests each bank to promptly notify the appropriateFDIC regional office when any public accountant or other external auditoris initially engaged to perform external auditing procedures and when achange in its accountant or auditor occurs.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Holding Company Subsidiaries  </ITAG>13. When the audit committee or board of directors of any state nonmemberbank owned by another company (such as a bank holding company) considersits external auditing program, it may find it appropriate to express thescope of its program in terms of the bank's relationship to the consolidatedgroup. No section of this statement of policy is intended to imply thatany state nonmember bank owned by another company is expected to obtaina separate audit of the financial statements of the individual bank. Wherethe state nonmember bank is directly or indirectly included in the auditof the consolidated financial statements of its parent company performedby an independent public accounting firm, the state nonmember bank maysend one copy of the comparable reports by the public acountant or notificationof the change in the accountants for the consolidated company to the appropriateregional director. If several banks supervised by the same FDIC regionaloffice are owned by one parent company, a single copy of each report applicableto the consolidated company may be submitted to the regional office onbehalf of all of the affiliated banks.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Troubled Banks  </ITAG>14. An annual independent external auditing program complements both theFDIC's supervisory process and bank internal auditing programs by furtheridentifying or clarifying issues of potential concern or exposure. It canalso greatly aid management in taking corrective action, particularly whenweaknesses are detected in internal control or management information systems.For these reasons, an annual audit of bank financial statements performedby an independent public accounting firm or, if more appropriate, specifiedauditing procedures will be a condition of future enforcement actions,when deemed necessary, or if it appears that any of the following conditionsmay exist:  (a) Internal controls and internal auditing procedures are inadequate; (b) The directorate is generally uniformed in the area of internal controls; (c) There is evidence of insider abuse;  (d) There are known or suspected defalcations;  (e) There is known or suspected criminal activity;  (f) It is probable that director liability for losses exists;  (g) Direct verification is warranted; and/or  (h) Questionable transactions with affiliates have occurred.  15. Such an enforcement action may also require that (a) the bank provideto the appropriate FDIC regional office a copy of the auditor's reportand any management letter received from the auditor promptly after thecompletion of any auditing work and that (b) the bank notify the regionaloffice in advance of the time and date of any meeting between managementand the auditor at which any auditing findings are to be presented so thata representative of the FDIC may be present if the FDIC so chooses. <ITAG tagnum="21">By order of the Board of Directors.
