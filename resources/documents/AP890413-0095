The government looked the other way, according to the report,when law enforcement agencies learned that drug traffickers wereprotected and aided by some U.S.-supported Nicaraguan Contras,members of the Honduran military, Panamanian strongman ManuelAntonio Noriega and Bahamian officials.   The 437-page report was prepared by the Senate Foreign Affairssubcommittee on terrorism, narcotics and international operations,whose chairman, John F. Kerry, D-Mass., held a series of publichearings last year on international drug trafficking.   Kerry told a news conference that anti-drug enforcement tooksecond place to foreign policy mainly ``for fear of jeopardizingthe war in Nicaragua.'' But he said that same war provided an``opportunity for drug traffickers to link up with the Contras _and they did.''   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., ranking Republican on thesubcommittee, said in a written statement that while he agreed with``substantial portions'' of the report, there were ``inaccuraciesin the representations of fact'' on the Contra-Drug issue.   He said many of the allegations were ``old news'' that wasconsidered by the Iran-Contra congressional committee, reviewed bygrand juries or presented in State Department reports to Congressin 1985-86.   In the most glaring examples of what the committee found to be atwo-faced policy during the Reagan years, the report said:   _While reports of Noriega's drug activities were mounting, theU.S. government ignored the evidence as the Panamanian strongmanpromised to help train Contra rebels and offered use of Panamanianunits to strike targets inside Nicaragua.   The late CIA Director William Casey justified his failure toraise the narcotics issue in a 1985 meeting with Noriega, thereport said, on grounds ``that Noriega was providing valuablesupport for our policies in Central America, especially Nicaragua.''   _The Drug Enforcement Administration apparently ignoredtrafficking allegations against Noriega because the now-indictedstrongman also cooperated in DEA operations. But the DEA wasfooled, the report said, when Noriega used his close relationshipwith the agency ``to share DEA information with traffickers.''   _``When a former Honduran military officer who has assisted theUnited States in the Contra war ... became involved in a`narco-terrorist' plot to kill the elected president of Honduras,high officials of the U.S. government interceded in an effort toget his sentenced reduced.''   The Honduran military, which the report said ``consistentlysupported U.S. policies in Central America,'' included elementsthat ``protected the cocaine trade,'' the report said.   _The Drug Enforcement Administration opened its first Honduranoffice in 1981 and closed it two years later for ``budgetaryreasons,'' even though the resident agent there found Honduranwaters were used for drug shipments. After the agent wastransferred to Guatemala, he continued to spend 70 percent of histime dealing with the Honduran drug problem, the report said.   _The government had evidence of numerous drug links involvingthe anti-Sandinista rebels, including participation in traffickingby individual Contras; use of Contra air strips by traffickers; andthe hiring of four airline companies, ``owned and operated bynarcotics traffickers, to supply humanitarian assistance to theContras.''   Before the State Department signed the contracts, the reportsaid, ``federal law enforcement had received information that theindividuals controlling these companies were involved innarcotics.''   ``Even after the State Department was acknowledging there wereproblems with drug trafficking in association with Contraactivities on the Southern Front, the Justice Department wasadamantly denying that there was any substance to the narcoticsallegations,'' the report said.   ``At the time, the FBI had significant information regarding theinvolvement of narcotics traffickers in Contra operations andNeutrality Act violations.''   Summig up its findings, the committee said, ``Foreign policypriorities towards the Bahamas, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama attimes delayed, halted, or interfered with U.S. law enforcement'sefforts to keep narcotics out of the United States.''   Referring specifically to the Contras, the report said, ``Thelogic of having drug money pay for the pressing needs of theContras appealed to a number of people who became involved in thecovert war. Indeed, senior U.S. policy-makers were not immune tothe idea that drug money was a perfect solution to the Contra'sfunding problems.''</TEXT></DOC>
