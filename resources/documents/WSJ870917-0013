The moves came as President Corazon Aquino continued to grapple with deep divisions within her government. She promised yesterday that a further shake-up of her 26-member cabinet would come soon.    The entire cabinet offered to resign last week to give the president a freer hand in the wake of two events -- the aborted coup attempt by dissident military elements, and, more immediately, congressional testimony by Executive Secretary Joker Arroyo, who lambasted several cabinet members, most notably Mr. Ongpin.    Although Mr. Arroyo is expected to be replaced as well, he still has great influence with Mrs. Aquino and appeared to have demanded Mr. Ongpin's resignation as one price for his stepping down.    The two men have fought an increasingly public battle within the faction-torn government. Their differences are as much personal as ideological, according to other government officials, but they embraced different political priorities. Mr. Ongpin stresses free-market economics, while Mr. Arroyo, a former human-rights lawyer, advocates social reform.    The exit from the cabinet of Messrs. Ongpin and Laurel signals the further disintegration of the coalition of human-rights advocates, conservative businessmen and old-time politicians that assembled around Mrs. Aquino.    The result of this diversity in the cabinet, said columnist Luis Beltran, &quot;was one of the most chaotic and amateurish cabinets ever to burden a president.&quot; Added a foreign banker: &quot;I'm amazed it held together as long as it did. You had so many strong characters who spent most of their time shooting each other.&quot;    Although she dismissed Mr. Ongpin, Mrs. Aquino signaled by her choice of a replacement that she desires to keep his policies. She appointed Public Works and Highways Secretary Vicente Jayme, who, like Mr. Ongpin, was associated with a loosely knit, religiously oriented business group that opposed the regime of President Ferdinand Marcos during its last years.    &quot;I don't expect any difference in the way the two would deal with creditors or with finance,&quot; said a local business executive. Before joining the cabinet, Mr. Jayme was a respected investment banker who headed a local merchant bank, Private Development Corp. of the Philippines.    Mr. Jayme &quot;has very good management skills, is a very clear thinker and very calm under fire,&quot; said George UyTioco, president of First Pacific Securities Philippines Inc. Equally important, said a high-ranking government official, Mr. Jayme &quot;isn't controversial.&quot;    Mr. Ongpin certainly has been. An outspoken man, the former head of one of the country's biggest mining companies increasingly has come under attack for his role in negotiating a restructuring package for the Philippines' more than $28 billion in debt. There have been calls within Mrs. Aquino's government and in the Philippine Congress to renegotiate part of that package.    Mr. Laurel, who remains as vice president, coupled his cabinet resignation with a blast at the president. He said Mrs. Aquino reneged on promises to share power with him. He also accused her of refusing to initiate an all-out campaign against communist insurgents and of continuing to include within her cabinet individuals who are &quot;sympathetic to communists or perceived to be sympathetic to the communists.&quot; Mr. Laurel declined to identify anyone, but Mr. Arroyo has been the target of similar charges in the past.    The vice president denied that he would join any opposition party, but he said he would oppose Mrs. Aquino publicly on certain issues. After the coup attempt, Mr. Laurel held a series of meetings with the military, prompting Mr. Arroyo to accuse him of &quot;fomenting dissension.&quot;    In a short television and radio address after Mr. Laurel's statement, Mrs. Aquino denied she is coddling the communist insurgents.    Mrs. Aquino named a retired general, Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Manuel Yan, as acting foreign affairs secretary to replace Mr. Laurel. She also named Fiorillo Estuar, a public works undersecretary, as acting secretary to take Mr. Jayme's place as public works and highways secretary.    In two other moves, the president nominated retired Lt. Gen. Salvador Mison, the former vice chief of staff, as customs commissioner, replacing Alexander Padilla and nominated Judge Miriam DefensorSantiago to replace Immigration and Deportation Commissioner Enrique Joaquin. </TEXT></DOC>
