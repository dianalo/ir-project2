L. 100-589) requires that ``the Secretary of Commerceshall promulgate regulations on fishing for Atlantic striped bass in theEEZ that the Secretary determines to be consistent with the national standardsin section 301 of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act(Pub. L. 94-265 as amended) and necessary and appropriate to (1) ensurethe effectiveness of state regulations or a federal moratorium on fishingfor Atlantic striped bass within the coastal waters of a coastal stateand (2) to achieve conservation and management goals for the Atlantic stripedbass resource.'' Indeveloping the regulations, the Secretary shall consultwith the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC), the appropriateRegional Fishery Management Councils, and each affected Federal, stateand local government entity. Section 6 also states that the appropriateRegional Fishery Management Councils may prepare a Fishery Management Planfor striped bass in the EEZ, which if approved and implemented, would supersedeany regulations promulgated by the Secretary.The Atlantic striped bass occurs predominately in internal state watersand the territorial sea. Historically, only about 7 percent of commerciallandings have been taken seaward of 3 miles (4.8 km) from the coastline.Management responsibility for striped bass resides primarily with the coastalstates, and management occurs through the Atlantic State Marine FisheriesCommission's Interstate Fisheries Management Plan for the Striped Bass(ASMFC Plan). This Plan was adopted in 1981 by the coastal states fromMaine through North Carolina in responsee to a severe decline in commerciallandings and in juvenile production in Maryland. Increasingly strict stateregulations have been imposed by amendments to the Plan since 1981 to restrictfurther the harvest of striped bass by recreational and commercial fisheriesand allow rebuilding of the stocks. A draft Fishery Management Plan wasprepared by the Mid-Atlantic Regional Fishery Management Council in 1984for the EEZ to complete the ASMFC Plan but was not adopted.Limited commercial catches of striped bass were made in the EEZ off Marylandin 1987 (24,000 pounds or 10.9 mt) and 1988 (27,000 pounds or 12.2 mt).Maryland's regulations, incuding a moratorium on the harvest of stripedbass in certain internal Maryland waters, did not prevent the landing ofthese fish in Maryland for trans-shipment to other states. These landingsand the absence of regulations in the EEZ prompted concern for a potentialincrease in harvest from the EEZ and resulted in section 6 of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Relevant Activities Pursuant to Section 6</ITAG>In response to Section 6 of the Act, NOAA Fisheries has considered severalregulatory options for the EEZ, and consulted with the ASMFC Striped BassManagement Board and the New England and Mid-Atlantic Fishery ManagementCouncils. Four options for regulating striped bass fishing in the EEZ wereidentified and discussed with the above groups. A brief discussion of theseoptions is presented below. Since these meetings, Option 1 has been splitinto Option 1A and 1B.Option 1A_Prohibition on the Harvest and the Possession of Striped Bassin the EEZ This approach, prohibiting the harvest (catch and retention) and possessionof striped bass from the EEZ, represents a strong conservation position,is easy to understand and easy to enforce. This option eliminates the excuse``I caught it in the EEZ'' for fishermen in state waters. This option wouldbe consistent with the national standards of Magnuson Act and supportiveof the objectives of the ASMFC Plan. Option 1B_Prohibition on the Harvest of Striped Bass in the EEZ This option, while prohibiting the harvest (catch and retention) of stripedbass in the EEZ, allows possession, while in the EEZ, of striped bass caughtlegally in state waters. Similar to Option 1A, this option represents astrong conservation position and would be consistent with the nationalstandards of the Magnuson Act. This option also eliminates the excuse ``Icaught it in the EEZ'' for fishermen in state waters. Additionally, a no-harvestprovision is similar to many of the state regulations and supportive ofthe ASMFC Plan. It would be harder to enforce than Option 1A, because itwould allow a fisherman to claim he had caught the fish legally in statewaters and that he was merely in transit across the EEZ. Option 2_Application of State Regulations to Fish Caught in the EEZ Under this option, regulations of the state where the fish are landed wouldapply to fish caught in the EEZ. This essentially imposes a Federal landinglaw that reinforces ASMFC-approved regulatory schemes, or extends a state'smanagement regime into the EEZ, based on dockside enforcement. This approachwould require that regulations in each state be reviewed and found consistentwith the national standards set forth in section 301 of the Magnuson Act.Becaue the states' management regimes differ, issues of discriminationbetween residents of different states (National Standard 4) and use ofbest scientific information (National Standard 2) are encountered. Eachtime a state regulation changes, consistency with the Magnuson Act wouldhave to be reexamined. Option 2 would allow for the taking of striped bassin the EEZ in quantities and sizes consistent with the regulations in thestate of landing. However, this approach does not address the issue offishermen harvesting from the EEZ and landing in a non-participatory state,where laws might be less restrictive or non-existent. Enforcement is linkedto entry into a state's waters, and this approach allows fishermen legallyto possess striped bass in the EEZ, because the applicable enforcementregime is only identified upon a fishermen's entry into coastal state watersand/or landing there. Thus, this option would not prohibit retention ofstriped bass of any size or number taken while in the EEZ. Such fish mightbe illegal in all participatory states, e.g., smaller than the lowest minimumsize limit. Option 3_Imposition of Specific Federal Regulations on Striped Bass Fishingin the EEZ Numerous regulations could be implemented under this Option, includingprovisions for daily limits, possession limits, gear restriction, seasonsand size limits. For example, one fish possession limit with a minimumsize equal to the ASMFC recommended minimum size could be implemented inthe EEZ. Any such Federal regulation, however, would supersede existingstate regulations governing Atlantic striped bass caught in the EEZ. Pursuantto this regulation, a fisherman could legally land in Maryland one fishat or above the minimum size taken from the EEZ even though Maryland hasa moratorium on striped bass fishing and a prohibition on possession offish taken in Maryland waters. This option would likely increase the totalharvest of striped bass, because the allowed catch under Federal regulationswould be in addition to the catch allowed by State regulations. Option 4_Status Quo or Take no ActionOption 4 would be to take no action at this time. Section 6 of the Actrequires the Secretary of Commerce to promulgate regulations that are ``necessaryand appropriate''. Effective January 9, 1989, Maryland enacted legislationthat prohibits the landing in Maryland of striped bass taken in the EEZ.The primary reason for Section 6 of the Act was the ``loophole'' that allowedfish taken in the EEZ to be landed in Maryland and trans-shipped to otherstates. The action by Maryland appears to eliminate the need for any actionby the Secretary of Commerce at this time, because there are no other knownlandings of striped bass of any magnitude from the EEZ.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>Recent contacts with representatives of each coastal state from Maine throughNorth Carolina did not identify any significant regulatory problem relatedto the harvest of striped bass from the EEZ that would be solved by imposingFederal regulations based on section 6 of the Act. The landings laws andother state regulations in place appear adequate to regulate the landingof striped bass harvested from the EEZ.The option initially preferred by NOAA Fisheries was Option 1A. The ASMFCStriped Bass Management Board did not vote on this proposed action, butdeferred a decision to the two involved Fishery Management Councils. However,concern was expressed that a no-take provision (Option 1B) would be moreacceptable than Option 1A, based on the example of the need to traversethe EEZ to reach the mainland with fish legally caught at Block Island,Rhode Island. Support was also expressed for Option 2, but the impracticabilityof determining the consistency of each state's regulations and the issueof discrimination were identified as nearly insurmountable constraints.In the absence of a fishery management plan for striped bass in the EEZ,NOAA Fisheries determined that implementation of either a no harvest andno possession or a no harvest provision would require about 10 months,based on the need for required documents and public comment periods underthe Administrative Procedure Act, the National Environment Policy Act,and Executive Order 12291. This, coupled with the lack of regulatory problemsin the coastal states, prompted NOAA Fisheries to then support Option 4,i.e., take no action. Presentations were made to the New England and Mid-AtlanticFishery Management Councils with this as the preferred option. The NewEngland Council voted unanimously to support Option 4, while the Mid-AtlanticCouncil voted to support Option 1A. Based on these divergent views, NOAAFisheries is now proposing, as its preferred option, Option 1B, a prohibitionon the harvest of striped bass from the EEZ on the Atlantic Coast, as acompromise position.Option 1B does not prohibit possession of striped bass in the EEZ. Fishlegally taken from state waters may be transported through the EEZ. Theno-harvest option would prevent development of a significant fishery inthe EEZ. This option is consistent with the National Standards of the MagnusonAct and, while more restrictive than regulations in some states, is supportiveof the restoration objectives of the ASMFC Plan. If Option 1B is implemented,the regulations would be effective through September 30, 1991, the expirationdate of the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act.NOAA Fisheries has determined that a full record of comment is necessarybefore determining whether to proceed with the proposed rule. Therefore,through this ANPR, NOAA Fisheries invites comments from all interestedparties on the options presented to regulate fishing for striped bass inthe Atlantic EEZ. In addition, comments on any other options are welcomedand encouraged.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard H.
