There's two seasons in baseball, in-seasonand out-of-season. My out-of-season is finally over. Now I can start havingfun.&quot;;    A stress fracture in his right kneecap limited Joyner to 83 gameslast season, when he hit .268 with eight home runs and 41 RBIs.;   California's offer was a $100,000 cut from Joyner's 1990 salary, which he wonin arbitration last winter. California had offered $1,225,000 last year.;   &quot;Wally didn't deserve a cut, and that's what the case was about,&quot; said MichaelWatkins, who presented Joyner's case with agent Barry Axelrod. &quot;When a playerproduces as he has, he doesn't deserve a cut.&quot;;    Mattingly's previous recordof $1,975,000 was set in 1987. Andre Dawson, Lonnie Smith and Benito Santiagoall failed in their attempts to break the record before Joyner prevailed.;   Joyner will be eligible for free agency after this season. Watkins refused tospeculate what the first baseman will do next fall.;    &quot;It's up to Wally inthe long run,&quot; Watkins said. &quot;But he's been with the Angels five years andlonger than that in the minors. He'll have to weigh all the factors.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Anaheim  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910211  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  247  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday February 11, 199100042202,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
