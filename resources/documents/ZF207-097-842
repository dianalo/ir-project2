Mencher, the company's senior vice president forcorporate marketing.andM;&quot;CCS-7 will substantially reduce call setup time for our customers,&quot; Menchersaid.andP;  &quot;In addition, this new protocol will increase efficiencies in ournetwork and enable us to better serve the sophisticated network managementneeds of our large corporate and government customers.&quot;andM;CCS-7, a backbone signaling system for ISDN, allows for a control path withinISDN that permits greater levels of network management and control.andP;  &quot;Thedeployment of CCS-7 in our network further demonstrates MCI's commitment tothe quality and competitiveness of its services,&quot; the MCI official said.andM;The new 56-kilobit/sec dial-up service from MCI offers potential customerswith short-duration requirements an on-demand, high-volume data transmissioncapability for the price of MCI voice calls.andP;  Initially it will be availableto users of MCI's virtual private network, Vnet, and outbound Prism I voiceservices.andM;Officials said a key feature of the service is that data transmissions willbe carried over the company's digital data network that serves more than 180cities.andM;&quot;Switched 56 service is a step toward MCI's future development of ISDNservices,&quot; Mencher said.andM;Link to NetViewandM;MCI View is the new integrated network management services application fromMCI.andP;  Developed in coopeation with IBM Corp., the service is designedspecifically for users of IBM's NetView network management system to givecustomers the ability to monitor network alarms and gain performanceinformation on both their voice and data services.andM;Through IBM's NetView, information is relayed to the customer's NetViewterminal where it can be accessed by the customer's telecommunicationsmanager.andP;  To use MCI View, customers must have a 9,600-bit/sec dedicatedprivate line and modem connected to their hosts.andM;Some of the benefits of MCI View include real-time monitoring of services,information on network efficiencies such as line use and identification ofservice outages to help reroute traffic, officials said.andM;ATandamp;T's new Definity 75/85 Communications System merges the architectures ofthe ATandamp;T System 75 and 85.andP;  Users of the System 75 and System 85, however,will be able to enhance their PBXs to the full functionality of the newsystem while retaining existing port hardware and peripherals.andM;Definity 75/85 will be offered in two configurations, the Definity Generic 1version being for users who do not need more than 1,600 lines, and theGeneric 2 version for those whose requirements are in the 30,000-plus linearea.andM;Though both configurations will support the ISDN primary rate interface, thespecification for connecting a communications system to either a host or thenetwork, Generic 2 also will support the ISDN basicrate interface (BRI), thespecification for connecting desktop devices to the switch.andM;&quot;We've combined the best of the best, making the system more powerful, yeteasier to use,&quot; said Jack Bucter, ATandamp;T's vice president of product managementand marketing.andM;Definity Generic 1 and Generic 2 will be available in March and July,respectively.andP;  It will cost $8,500 to upgrade a System 75 to a Generic 1, and$35,000 to upgrade a System 85 to a Generic 2.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
