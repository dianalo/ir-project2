SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Turned out of power last month after 45years of supreme rule, the Communist Party is hunting for a newimage and a program to win it a place in a more democratic Poland.   Everyone agrees it will not be easy.   As the first Communist Party in the East bloc to lose control ofgovernment, it has few models to follow.   ``Now it's a not a question of following examples, but settingexamples,'' said Janusz Kubasiewicz, Warsaw party chief andPolitburo member.   Never accepted by most Poles who viewed the party as a Sovietpuppet, Polish communism itself never really fit the rigid Sovietmold.   The party grew out of the 1948 forced merger of the PolishSocialist Party, an authentic Polish leftist movement, and thepro-Moscow Polish Workers Party that replaced the Polish partyliquidated in the late 1930s on Stalin's orders.   After the war, workers and students repeatedly challenged theparty's authority in a series of bloody uprisings. In 1980, theindependent workers' movement, Solidarity, seriously eroded theparty's legitimacy.   Hundreds of thousands of party members joined Solidarity and 16months later, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski declared martial law to crushthe movement and stop further decline in the party.   After labor unrest broke out in 1988 and the economy slid,Jaruzelski forced the party to agree to legalize Solidarity again.The April deal to legalize the union also called for Solidarity toback partially free elections.   Union-backed candidates swept to victory and the Communistssuffered a humiliating defeat. Although guaranteed a majority in theSejm, the powerful lower house of parliament, the Communists wereunable to form a government.   On Aug. 24 Solidarity adviser Tadeusz Mazowiecki was elected tolead Poland's first non-Communist government in 45 years.   In the past few months, pragmatic party members have realizeddrastic changes are needed if the party is to recover.   One of the first tasks was to consider pruning the word Communistfrom the lexicon.   ``Our party must be a socialist party, we must get away from theword `communism' because nobody knows what it means,'' said newlyelected Central Committee secretary Marek Krol. ``From now on wemust be a political party, or it's over.''   Other changes are also in the offing. Fifteen deputies on behalfof the Communist parliamentary caucus have proposed removing theclause in the constitution that mandates that the Communist Party be``the leading political force in society.''   Deputy Sejm speaker Tadeusz Fiszbach says more such iniatitvesare likely. ``We don't want to be seen by the electorate as thosewho are blocking change.''   But cosmetic changes are not enough for Fiszbach. He wants toensure that the 173-member Communist caucus in Parliament will playa role in shaping party policy, rather than being just a tool of theCentral Committee as in the past.   Party leaders used to be seated in Parliament, but in June almostall top party candidates were defeated. Those elected feel they owetheir election to the voters and not the party.   ``The party leadership has to seek our opinion. We are not goingto cooperate with them under a dictate,'' said Fiszbach, formerGdansk party leader who signed the agreements to legalize Solidarityin 1980 and was stripped of his party positions for pro-Solidaritysympathies in 1982.   Changing its name and initiating popular legislation may help theparty, but it is trying to change its image at a time that it willno longer have unlimited access to media.   Mazowiecki intends to keep the powerful post of president ofradio and television committee for Solidarity.   The Central Committee has turned over its department ofpropaganda to Krol, who attracted attention as the editor of Wprost,a provocative party weekly in the western city of Poznan.   He wants to depoliticize the party's newspaper, Trybuna Ludu, getinternal party matters off the front page, and develop interestingtelevision programs.   ``We have to prove we can be attractive, because biologically theparty is dying,'' he said.   Party membership stands at about 2.1 million down more than amillion from 1980 and the average age is 46, the oldest in itshistory. And 17.6 percent of the members are retirees, said anAugust article in the party weekly Polityka.   Membership slipped by 35,000 in the first half of 1989, Politykasaid, and party officials say they expect more members to quit.   One of the things party members are worried about are their jobs.Three out of four administrative jobs in Poland are held by peoplewho secured their positions through party patronage, Polityka said.   There are signs that some of those workers already may be introuble. The strike committee at a northeast Poland meat packingplant called off a protest Thursday after winning dismissal of themanager, a party member, according to a Solidarity journalistpresent at negotiations.   Some party members are reportedly securing their futures byconverting government-owned businesses into private businesses ownedby them. Such conversions have been bitterly attacked in thepro-Solidarity press.   Fiszbach says the party cannot win social support as long as itsmembers retain privileges it cannot justify. But he said other partymembers are determined to hang on to those perks.   Such divisions threaten to split the party and there is talk thatthe party could splinter into two or three groups.   The question is what political orientation the party shouldadopt. Some favor becoming an orthodox Communist Party while otherswould prefer simply a broad-based social democratic party that couldpossibly attract even left-leaning members of Solidarity.</TEXT></DOC>
