Top executives of Atek Metals Center Inc. had grown suspicious of their controller's opulent life style. And Jeanetta Ponchot's new houseboat, purchased with cash, spurred officials to pore over the books of the Cincinnati maker of specialty metals products. In late May, they discovered at least $700,000 had vanished. Immediately, they asked for and received a court freeze on Ms. Ponchot's assets.    By acting as soon as it discovered the money was missing, Atek Metals may have lessened what could have been even more devastating losses. Nevertheless, the amount equaled the company's first-half profits for its fiscal 1989.    Unlike Atek Metals, most small companies aren't as perceptive or as quick to act, say fraud investigators and consultants. Few are equipped to detect embezzlement, often because they can't afford extensive internal safeguards. Indeed, &quot;half of those caught are nabbed by accident,&quot; says Joseph T. Wells, chairman of the National Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, a trade group based in Austin, Texas. Tips snare one-third and audits the rest, Mr. Wells said.    Even if a theft is uncovered, many companies don't know how to recover the funds. &quot;Once a company thinks the money can't be recovered, it asks if it's worth the bother, and the answer is usually 'no,' says Mr. Wells, a former Federal Bureau of Investigation fraud sleuth. &quot;They don't want the negative publicity.&quot;    And by sweeping the wrongdoing under the rug, executives seek to avoid being accused of mismanagement by directors and shareholders. Yet by doing so, embezzlers are free to commit the same crime elsewhere, exacerbating the problem. Employee theft costs businesses an estimated $70 billion to $100 billion a year.    Atek Metals, rather than hiding the matter, pressed charges in Butler County Court in Ohio. In a civil suit filed last month, the company accused Jeanetta Ponchot of stealing the money over the past two years by substituting her name for that of Atek Metals on checks from suppliers, as well as pocketing travel expenses charged by employees to the company. When confronted by superiors, she handed over the title to the boat and $75,000 in cash, according to the company's suit. Ms. Ponchot declined comment. An investigation by the company continues.    Besides recovering the houseboat and $75,000, Atek Metals officials, who are reluctant to disclose details of the case, also filed the suit to recover the rest of the funds and to ask for punitive damages.    Atek Metal's case, like many others of its kind, involved an employee who was considered something of a model. She has been described by Barry F. Bucher, Atek Metal's chief executive officer as &quot;very loyal, devoted employee, who earned a lot of trust from us.&quot; Ms. Ponchot joined the firm as an accountant and became a controller within five years, the company says.    Acting on a tip, however, Atek Metal officials say they became suspicious about their controller's life style, which strengthened their belief she was living well beyond her $45,000-a-year salary. Without the tip -- the source of which the company refused to characterize in any way -- Atek Metals perhaps wouldn't have conducted an audit and uncovered the accounting discrepancies.    All of which suggests how difficult it can be to catch a thief inside the company -- especially when the company is small. Smaller companies, in particular, make themselves vulnerable to embezzlement because they often permit a single official or just a couple of employees to handle their finances. That can foster fraud. A former accountant and chief financial officer of First National Bank in Crossville, Tenn., pleaded guilty to stealing $112,000. He could transfer funds to his account undetected and then write them off as bank expenses.    In another case, an accountant at a Lincoln, Neb., light-fixture company pleaded guilty to embezzling $416,000 by cooking the accounting ledgers. Because she worked alone, she would write a check to a supplier for, say, $15,000, then write down $20,000 on the books, taking the $5,000 for herself.    &quot;It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out you shouldn't have a person write the checks and balance the books,&quot; says Mr. Wells. &quot;But that's fairly common.&quot;    Fraud investigators contend companies could prevent embezzling -- or at least catch it in its early stages -- by employing an internal auditor who could raise a red flag to suspicious accounting. &quot;Having an outsider who comes in once in a while won't do it,&quot; says Albert Murphy, a veteran security consultant. Outside auditors, he notes, usually include a disclaimer in their contracts that seeks to protect them should they fail to uncover fraud.    For small companies that can't afford internal auditors or two people to divide bookkeeping and accounting duties, financial consultants recommend more periodic audits by an outside firm, or simply having a company's bank statements delivered unopened to a top executive for review.    The larger lessons here are numerous. A company's top executives also should be wary even if an employee with access to the purse strings has been an exemplary performer. Executives might also do well to consider why employees embezzle. Increasingly, white-collar criminals steal to support an expensive drug habit, security experts say. Others embezzle because &quot;they feel they're entitled to it,&quot; says Mr. Murphy. Either way, the embezzler often will exhibit some physical or emotional sign, which should raise a red flag.    Many embezzlers get away with fraud because their employers don't know what to do once they uncover it or how to recover the stolen funds. Security experts suggest several actions that small companies in particular can employ to recover much or all of the stolen funds.    Companies can follow Atek Metal's example and seek restitution directly from the accused employee or by filing a civil suit seeking repayment directly or through assets.    &quot;Generally, in the best interest of the company and investors, I recommend going this way,&quot; Mr. Murphy says.    Companies can also take out an insurance policy -- known as a fidelity bond -- on its top officers. In order to collect, the company must prove through accounting records or receipts that fraud occurred. A conviction or admission of wrongdoing will also suffice to claim a loss.    If funds can't be recovered, take a federal tax deduction for theft losses to ease the impact on the company's earnings, recommends G.J. Bologna, former head of a fraud-auditing firm and now associate professor of management at Siena Heights College in Michigan. He also favors informing the Internal Revenue Service of the fraud to prevent the employee from embezzling again. &quot;If it's been going on for more than a year, the embezzler must have falsified his taxes,&quot; Mr. Bologna says. &quot;Notifying the IRS is totally devastating to them.&quot; @ --- @ Embezzlement Losses @ (Including bank embezzlements) @ ARRESTS MADE @ FBI BY FBI FOR @ CITATIONS EMBEZZLEMENT @ 1988 $2,191,756,491 N.A. @ 1987 860,599,398 12,700 @ 1986 606,154,566 12,600 @ 1980 N.A. 8,500 @ N.A. = Not available </TEXT></DOC>
