President Bush and the other leaders Sunday ended their two-daysummit earlier than expected and congratulated themselves on howwell they had worked together.   ``The summit, in my view, was a clear success,'' Bush toldreporters at a news conference on the manicured grounds of the U.S.ambassador's residence in Paris.   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, attending his fifthconference, said it was ``the one that achieved the largest degreeof consensus.''   ``It was a splendid summit,'' gushed first-time participantSousuke Uno, Japan's embattled prime minister.   And Britain's prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, dismissedreports she had been snubbed by the French whose birthday bash forthe 200th anniversary of their revolution coincided with the summit.   ``Indeed, I have received every attention,'' she insisted.   The leaders' talks, held annually since 1975 to examine theeconomies' health, were nearly overshadowed by Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev, who sent a surprise letter urging moreEast-West cooperation on economic issues.   Bush said the letter, addressed to French President FrancoisMitterrand, caught the leaders' attention. ``It was just one moremanifestation of the changing world we're living in,'' Bush said.   He and others, however, brushed aside suggestions Gorbachev wouldfind a seat at the summit table next year. ``That's a littlepremature,'' Bush said.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he was pleased theKremlin chief recognized ``the responsibility of the Soviet Union inresolving world economic problems.''   The summiteers _ representing the United States, Canada, France,Britain, Germany, Italy and Japan _ picked up on growing publicworries about polluted air, water and land and devoted about a thirdof their final 22-page statement to the environment.   ``Decisive action,'' they said, ``is urgently needed tounderstand and protect the earth's ecological balance.''   They condemned dumping wastes in the oceans, spilling oil in theseas and stripping forests of trees. They worried that excessiveemissions of carbon dioxide and other gases could change the world'sclimate.   To arrest the deterioration, they called for more scientificresearch to come up with innovative solutions, urged industry toplay its part and supported international efforts to save tropicalrain forests.   ``This summit marked a watershed in the environment,'' Bush said.   Environmental groups welcomed the high profile given thepollution fight but complained about the lack of specific details.   ``The heads of state have failed to propose the decisive actionsnecessary to confront the deteriorating trends,'' said RafePomerance, senior associate at the World Resources Institute inWashington.   The leaders also appealed for ``decisive action'' to stem theproduction and demand for illegal narcotics and backed Mrs.Thatcher's call for a conference next year on the problem.   They also agreed to set up a task force to come up with ways byApril 1990 to keep drug traffickers from using private banks tolaunder, or hide the origin, of their illicit profits.   Turning to economic issues, they embraced the latest efforts tohelp the developing nations in their struggle with $1.3 trillion inforeign debts. The new strategy, unveiled last March by TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady, emphasizes debt reduction or forgivenessfor those countries.   ``Our approach to the debt problems has produced significantresults,'' they said, ``but serious challenges remain.''   They urged bankers to take ``realistic and constructiveapproaches'' in negotiations with poorer countries and ``movepromptly'' to wind up those talks on new debt-reduction programs.   Mexico, the developing world's No. 2 debtor after Brazil, isexpected soon to reach an agreement with its bankers for a new debtplan. When it does, it will become the first to take advantage ofthe Brady plan.   The ``Summit Seven'' said they saw no recession in sight butissued a cautionary note about rising inflation in some countries.   They singled out the United States, Canada and Italy for morework on reducing their governments' red ink. Japan and Germany, theysaid, should take additional steps to reduce their large tradesurpluses.   The United States will host next year's summit. No place has yetbeen picked but Bush hinted his home state of Texas would be a``distinct possibility.''</TEXT></DOC>
