In this paper, the purificationof dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase from Halobacterium halobium is reported.The enzyme is a dimer with a polypeptide chain M/sub r/ of 58,000 (+/-3000).The amino acid composition of the enzyme is compared with those of theeubacterial and eukaryotic dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenases, and evidenceis presented to suggest that the N-terminal amino acid of the H. halobiumenzyme is blocked. Chemical modification with the trivalent arsenicalreagent (p-aminophenyl)dichloroarsine indicates the involvement of areversibly reducible disulfide bond in the enzyme's catalytic mechanism.The possible metabolic role of this dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase inthe absence of 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
