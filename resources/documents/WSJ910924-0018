The initiative is expected to provoke fights amongpolitical parties and interest groups seeking constitutionalreforms. It was drafted following the collapse last year of aconstitutional accord that would have recognized Quebec as a&quot;distinct society&quot; within Canada.</LP><TEXT>   The government, in a bid to win support for its new plan,has opened up the process to include the constitutionaldemands of western Canadians, women, natives and ethnicgroups, as well as those of Quebec. It also has invitedproposals that would broaden its own plan.   For example, Ontario's left-wing New Democratic Partygovernment will push for a social rights charter that wouldconstitutionally guarantee every Canadian the right tomedical care, welfare assistance, unemployment insurance andbasic education. Ontario Premier Bob Rae said he intends toseek broad public support for the plan even though thefederal government has questioned its feasibility.   Alberta, in a move opposed by Quebec, will press for anelected Senate that would give western provinces greaterclout in the government. Quebec is opposed to such a changebecause it would weaken Quebec's parliamentary leverage. Thegovernment currently appoints members of the 106-seat upperchamber of Parliament.   Native groups are urging constitutional recognition oftheir right to self-government. Ethnic groups want similarrecognition of cultural diversity as a fundamentalcharacteristic of Canadian society.   The new federal proposals, like the previous plannegotiated at Meech Lake, Quebec, will recognize Quebecconstitutionally as a &quot;distinct society&quot; within Canada,federal politicians said. The distinct society clause will be&quot;the lightning rod&quot; for critics of the government plan,predicted Patrick Monahan, director of Toronto's Centre forPublic Law and Public Policy.   Almost two-thirds of English-speaking Canadians opposedistinct-society status for Quebec, according to a recentopinion poll. The Quebec government claims such a provisionis needed to protect the province's French language andculture.   &quot;Canadians are tired of Quebec's demands,&quot; according toDeborah Grey, a member of Parliament for the AlbertabasedReform Party, which opposes concessions to Quebec.   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservative government,with a current approval rating of only 16%, is too unpopularto try to strong-arm the provinces into accepting itsconstitutional plan. It also has little financial leveragebecause of constraints imposed by a huge federal debt, whichamounts to almost 60% of the country's gross nationalproduct.   &quot;Money can float off a lot of problems,&quot; said GordonRobertson, a former senior federal official.   The federal government will offer some federal powers tothe provinces, but the transfer is expected to fall far shortof Quebec's demands. Quebec's ruling Liberal Party hasthreatened to hold a referendum on political independence bythe fall of 1992 if it isn't satisfied with theconstitutional plan.   The government's proposals will need the assent of thefederal Parliament and at least seven of the 10 provinciallegislatures. They will be submitted later this week to aspecial parliamentary committee with the broadest mandate ofany such panel in Canadian history, said Joe Clark, theconstitutional affairs minister. The committee, which willhold hearings across the country, is to report to thegovernment by late February.</TEXT></DOC>
