He also knows the value of a dollar, andhe's ready to grab a lot of them from the NFL after the draft in April.;  Whitfield, a consensus All-America tackle as a junior at Stanford, didn'tspend many sleepless nights deciding whether to forgo his senior season.Common sense made the decision for him. After two years of strugglingfinancially as a self-supporting student-athlete, he had no choice but to takethe money.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  STANFORD'S WHITFIELD GOING PRO  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Whitfield says he'll formally announce his intentions after Stanford playsGeorgia Tech in the Aloha Bowl on Christmas Day.;   &quot;You're asking a playerwho has a chance to make money he never had before -- a young, desperate blackmale -- to stay at a school that can't really help me out as much as I canhelp myself? That's ludicrous,&quot; Whitfield said recently, before he and theteam flew to Hawaii on Thursday night. &quot;You're asking me to stick my neck outfor this university that doesn't even give me money to do my laundry becauseof NCAA rules?&quot;;   Whitfield contemplated forgoing his senior seasonthroughout this year and indicated he probably came to a decision after theBig Game. He is at peace with leaving, but he can't help but feel a bitmelancholy. Just when the football program is on the verge of success, justwhen it starts to generate a decent amount of student interest, just when itlands quality, competitive athletes, it's time to move on.;   &quot;It's likewalking in the desert for two years and you don't see any water. Then finallyyou see a puddle of water and then you see milkshakes and cheeseburgers and ahamburger stand,&quot; said Whitfield, who is 6-foot-7 and weighs 300 pounds. &quot;It'slike, I'm finally starting to like school -- not overwhelmed by it, but likingit -- and then the scouts and the agents start calling and it's time toleave.&quot;;   But common sense and dollar bills tell Whitfield he would befoolish to stay. Draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. ranks Whitfield as theseventh-best player in the draft and the No. 1 offensive lineman.;   &quot;We havehim rated pretty high, probably a first-round pick,&quot; said Billy Wilson, whoscouts the West for the 49ers. &quot;I can't see him going any lower than thesecond round.&quot;;   He'll be in the money;   That translates into amultimillion-dollar contract. Tennessee's Charles McRae, the first offensivelineman selected in this year's draft, received a five-year contract worth$4.8 million with a $2 million signing bonus when Tampa Bay made him theseventh pick overall. That's considerably more than the $2 million Whitfieldwould get from his insurance policy if he stayed another year and becameinjured.;   Such a scenario almost played out in the Big Game, when Whitfieldwas temporarily sidelined because of a knee injury.;   &quot;The odds aren't goodfor me making it through another game alive,&quot; he said. &quot;It was hard enough tomake it through this year. In the Cal game, I thought it was over. I knowreality. I know being in school another year won't be the best thing for me.;  Common sense;   &quot;Is Stanford going to pay me the difference that I'd belosing in salary because I stayed an extra year and helped their footballteam? No. Common sense tells you no. They say it's no cost recovery but you'llgo to a bowl game, maybe the Rose Bowl. Who gets all that money from the RoseBowl? Not us. Not the players.;   &quot;I may be young, but I'm not dumb,&quot; saidWhitfield, who has until Feb. 1 to declare himself eligible for the NFLdraft.;   At 20, Whitfield would be the youngest lineman in the NFL. But hehas matured quickly. He has been the man of the house since his father, Bob,died during the younger Whitfield's sophomore year at Banning High inWilmington. He also helps support his 20-month-old daughter, LaNiece, wholives with her mother in Los Angeles.;   Whitfield is an adult with adultresponsibilities. But the restrictions placed on him by college football havemade him feel degraded and resentful.;   Whitfield's situation;   &quot;They don'tallow you to work during the year. My mom hasn't given me anything all year.She has to support herself,&quot; he said. &quot;There are a lot of people on the teamwho are self-supportive. They should have some kind of subsidy for low-incomeathletes.&quot;;   In addition to his scholarship, Whitfield receives about $700 ayear in financial assistance. But even that didn't come through during hissophomore year.;   &quot;They said my mom filed incorrectly on her income. My momdoesn't have a good job. She doesn't even make $20,000 a year,&quot; he said.;  &quot;We don't even get any money for toiletries, so me and my homeys steal toilettissue to save money. We steal toilet tissue from the restrooms. We have totake two showers a day, so we share soap. And we don't go out, because itcosts $10 to go to a club and have a nice time. Things like that you shouldn'thave to worry about.&quot;;   Whitfield said he never heard of Stanford before hewas recruited and wound up there solely because of Coach Denny Green, whoguaranteed him the second spot on the depth chart. A week into his firstseason, Whitfield was starting, and he was named to the all-Pacific 10Conference team as a freshman.;   Still, his disappointment stemmed over twoyears of losing seasons, coupled with the nonchalant attitude surrounding thefootball program. So Whitfield, who could never be described as a meek person,would say things to fire up the team, such as predicting Stanford would beatdefending Rose Bowl champion Washington by 60 points this season. He wascriticized for his remarks when the Cardinal lost by 35.;   &quot;If people saidthat was the reason we lost, they can pull out the game film and watch meplay, because I played every down hard that game,&quot; Whitfield said. &quot;I mighthave been the only one out there playing to win, because everybody else mighthave been scared. . . . If you had more people like me out there playing,Stanford would be 11-0 every year.&quot;;   Whitfield said his play wasinconsistent this season, especially against lesser competition. Butoffensive-line coach Scott Schuhmann says Whitfield played well during everygame and improved his run blocking so much that the Cardinal ran left almost90 percent of the time while gaining 1,812 yards.;   &quot;You've got to rememberthat you grade Bob Whitfield on a different scale than the others,&quot; Schuhmannsaid. &quot;You don't find too many players with Bob's skills relative to his size.If you do, they're thinner and playing in the NBA.&quot;;   Bob Whitfield won't bein the NBA next year. In all likelihood, he'll be a 20-year-old NFLmillionaire.;   And for Whitfield, that prospect is a whole lot better thanstealing toilet paper.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ANNETTE JOHN-HALL, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911220  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,178  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, December 20, 199100355154,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
