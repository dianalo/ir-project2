As a result, questions are rising over the direction ofpetroleum prices over the next few weeks. If OPEC doesn't cutproduction soon, analysts say, oil inventories will rise andprices could fall.</LP><TEXT>   March production was at or near 24 million barrels a day,topping February production and the highest level in eightyears, according to new estimates from those who monitor OPECoutput. And there are few signs that the pace will slow thismonth.   On the contrary, trackers of oil tankers said yesterdaythat vessel charterings for April loadings in the PersianGulf are near a three-year peak. That, they said, suggestshigher OPEC output for the month. Also, leading OPEC membersrecently offered steep discounts to some customers to hold orexpand sales volumes.   &quot;OPEC producers have now reached the threshold wherecontinued overproduction could push {their} basket pricebelow $18 {a barrel} during the seasonally lowest point ofdemand over the next two months,&quot; OPEC Listener, an industryanalysis service, reported. &quot;But all signs point toproduction staying near 24 million barrels a day in April,&quot;added Cristina Haus, an OPEC Listener analyst.   OPEC's high production already has led to some weakeningin oil markets, with prices down as much as $3 a barrel sincethe first of the year. While oil analysts generally agreewith OPEC economists that rebounding demand will lead tofirmer prices in the second half, most industry officialslook for more softening over the next few weeks. The debateis over how much further prices may fall.   Price projections of Edward N. Krapels, president of aWashington-based firm which monitors oil supplies world-wide,fall in the middle of the range. &quot;We don't think it {theprice outlook} will get much worse,&quot; he said. For the U.S.benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, he sees $20 abarrel as the floor. But he believes Dubai, an importantMiddle East crude, could go below $15.   In U.S. futures trading yesterday, West Texas Intermediatefor May delivery settled at $20.30 a barrel, down 18 cents.On European spot markets, meantime, April and May cargos ofDubai were unchanged from day-earlier levels of $15.60 and$15.65 a barrel, according to the Dow Jones InternationalPetroleum Report.   The Paris-based International Energy Agency was amongthose issuing new estimates yesterday on OPEC production. Inits latest report, the IEA placed March OPEC output at 23.7million barrels a day, unchanged from February. Several otherMarch production estimates from industry sources, includingthe OPEC Listener, were higher, averaging some 24 millionbarrels a day.   Even the IEA report suggested the beginning of a buildupin oil inventories. It showed that total inventories in the24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment were some 450 million tons on April 1, up ninemillion tons from a year earlier. Each ton contains aboutseven barrels of oil.   The IEA said that because of expected increases in demandover the like 1989 periods these inventories are equal to 97days of forward consumption, about the same as a yearearlier. But the latest tabulation of oil inventories by Mr.Krapels' Washington firm of Energy Security Analysis, at theend of February, showed 4.05 billion barrels of oil instorage world-wide, some 80 million barrels above theyear-earlier level.   Industry statistics also are showing rising inventories ofcrude oil in the U.S. According to the American PetroleumInstitute's weekly report released late yesterday, theseinventories totaled 362.8 million barrels Friday, up 4.3million barrels from a week earlier.   Oil traders said the increase, which was much larger thanexpected, could be bearish for petroleum markets today. Butthey said this could be offset by the bigger-than-expecteddecline of 7.1 million barrels in gasoline inventories lastweek.</TEXT></DOC>
