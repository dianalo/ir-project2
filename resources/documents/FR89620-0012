Thecomplete text of this Commission action, including the rule amendments,is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours inthe FCC Dockets Branch (Room 230), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC.The complete text of this Report and Order, including the rule amendments,may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, InternationalTranscription Services, (202) 857-3800, 2100 M Street, NW., Suite 140,Washington, DC 20037.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Report and Order</ITAG>1. The amateur service rules have been amended by restructuring them toprovide a more meaningful, easy-to-use body of regulations for presentand future amateur operators. Unnecessary, obsolete, and redundant ruleprovisions have been deleted.2. The emission designators were simplified into a simple system basedupon nine terms that are already familiar to amateur operators, such asphone, RTTY, and CW. This makes it possible for amateur operators to understandimmediately their authorized emissions. It also promotes flexibility andexperimentation by clarifying the wide range of emission types available.3. The existing language for the quiet hours rule has been retained. Thiswill alleviate the concerns of the commenters in this proceeding who feltthat the proposed rule would broaden the Commission's authority to restrictamateur station operations.4. In addition to the foregoing, these final rules clarify and codify amateurservice policies and practices. For example, the exceptions to the prohibitionsagainst transmission of business communications and against broadcastinghave been codified.5. The amended rules are set forth at the end of this document.6. Pursuant to section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5U.S.C. 605, the Commission certifies that these rules will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because theseentities may not use the amateur radio services for commercial radiocommunication.Morever, these rules will not require the use of or significantly enhancethe sale of any additional amateur service apparatus.7. These rules have been analyzed with respect to the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq</T3>., and found to decrease the information collection burdenthat the Commission imposes on the public. This proposed reduction in informationcollection burden is subject to approval by the Office of Management andBudget as prescribed by the Act.8. The amended rules are issued under the authority of 47 U.S.C. 154(i)and 303(r).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 47 CFR Part 97</ITAG>Amateur radio, Antennas, Emissions, Third-party traffic.<ITAG tagnum="6">Donna R.

(For each ITU Region, each frequency band allocatedto the amateur service is designated as either a secondary service or aprimary service. A station in a secondary service must not cause harmfulinterference to, and must accept interference from, stations in a primaryservice. See andSection;andSection; 2.105 and 2.106 of the FCC Rules, <T3>United States Table of Frequency Allocations</T3> for complete requirements.)(a) Where, in adjacent ITU Regions or Subregions, a band of frequenciesis allocated to different services of the same category, the basic principleis the equality of right to operate. The stations of each service in oneregion must operate so as not to cause harmful interference to servicesin the other Regions or Subregions. (See ITU <T3>Radio Regulations,</T3> No. 346 (Geneva, 1979).)(b) No amateur station transmitting in the 1900-2000 kHz segment, the 1.25m band, the 70 cm band, the 33 cm band, the 13 cm band, the 9 cm band,the 5 cm band, the 3 cm band, the 24.05-24.24 GHz segment, the 76-81 GHzsegment, the 144-149 GHz segment and the 241-248 GHz segment shall causeharmful interference to, nor is protected from interference due to theoperation of, the Government radiolocation service.(c) No amateur station transmitting in the 1900-2000 kHz segment, the 3cm band, the 76-81 GHz segment, the 144-149 GHz segment and the 241-248GHz segment shall cause harmful interference to, nor is protected frominterference due to the operation of, stations in the non-Government radiolocationservice.(d) No amateur station transmitting in the 30 meter band shall cause harmfulinterference to stations authorized by other nations in the fixed service.The licensee of the amateur station must make all necessary adjustments,including termination of transmissions, if harmful interference is caused.(e) The 1.25 m band is allocated to the amateur, fixed and mobile servicesin the United States on a co-primary basis. The basic principle that appliesis the equality of right to operate. Amateur, fixed and mobile stationsmust operate so as not to cause harmful interference to each other.(f) In the 70 cm band:(1) No amateur station shall transmit from north of Line A in the 420-430MHz segment.(2) The 420-430 MHz segment is allocated to the amateur service in theUnited States on a secondary basis, and is allocated in the fixed and mobile(except aeronautical mobile) services in the International Table of allocationson a primary basis. No amateur station transmitting in this band shallcause harmful interference to, nor is protected from interference due tothe operation of, stations authorized by other nations in the fixed andmobile (except aeronautical mobile) services.(3) The 430-440 MHz segment is allocated to the amateur service on a secondarybasis in ITU Regions 2 and 3. No amateur station transmitting in this bandin ITU Regions 2 and 3 shall cause harmful interference to, nor is protectedfrom interference due to the operation of, stations authorized by othernations in the radiolocation service. In ITU Region 1, the 430-440 MHzsegment is allocated to the amateur service on a co-primary basis withthe radiolocation service. As between these two services in this band inITU Region 1, the basic principle that applies is the equality of rightto operate. Amateur stations authorized by the United States and radiolocationstations authorized by other nations in ITU Region 1 shall operate so asnot to cause harmful interference to each other.(4) No amateur station transmitting in the 449.5-450 MHz segment shallcause interference to, nor is protected from itnerference due to the operationof stations in, the space operation service and the space research serviceor Government or non-Government stations for space telecommand.(g) In the 33 cm band:(1) No amateur station shall transmit from within the States of Coloradoand Wyoming, bounded on the south by latitude 39anddegrees;N., on the northby latitude 42anddegrees;N., on the east by longitude 105anddegrees;W., andon the west by longitude 108anddegrees;W. This band is allocated on a secondarybasis to the amateur service subject to not causing harmful interferenceto, and not receiving protection from any interference due to the operationof, industrial, scientific and medical devices, automatic vehicle monitoringsystems or Government stations authorized in this band.(2) No amateur station shall transmit from those portions of the Statesof Texas and New Mexico bounded on the south by latitude 31anddegrees;41andmin172;N.,on the north by latitude 34anddegrees;30andmin172;N., on the east by longitude104anddegrees;11andmin172;W., and on the west by longitude 107anddegrees;30andmin172;W.(h) No amatuer station transmitting in the 23 cm band, the 3 cm band, the24.05-24.25 GHz segment, the 76-81 GHz segment, the 144-149 GHz segmentand the 241-248 GHz segment shall cause harmful interference to, nor isprotected from interference due to the operation of, stations authorizedby other nations in the radiolocation service.(i) In the 1240-1260 MHz segment, no amateur station shall cause harmfulinterference to, nor is protected from interference due to the operationof, stations in the radionavigation-satellite service.(j) In the 13 cm band:(1) The amateur service is allocated on a secondary basis in all ITU Regions.In ITU Region 1, no amateur station shall cause harmful interference to,and is not protected from interference due to the operation of, stationsauthorized by other nations in the fixed service. In ITU Regions 2 and3, no station shall cause harmful interference to, and is not protectedfrom interference due to the operation of, stations authorized by othernations in the fixed, mobile and radiolocation services.(2) In the United States, 2300-2310 MHz segment is allocated to the amateurservice on a co-secondary basis with the Government fixed and mobile services.In this segment, the fixed and mobile services must not cause harmful interferenceto the amateur service. No amateur station transmitting in the 2400-2450MHz segment is protected from interference due to the operation of industrial,scientific and medical devices on 2450 MHz.(k) No amateur station transmitting in the 3.332-3.339 GHz and 3.3458-3525GHz segments, the 2.5 mm band, the 144.68-144.98 GHz, 145.45-145.75 and146.82-147.12 GHz segments and the 343-348 GHz segment shall cause harmfulinterference to stations in the radio astronomy service.
