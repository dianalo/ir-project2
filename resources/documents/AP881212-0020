Most U.S. dairy production is consumed as Grade A milk, cheese,butter and non-fat dry milk. But dairy economist Jim Miller of theUSDA's Economic Research Service says several frequently overlookedproducts ``lie in the shadows'' of the big-volume items.   These include eggnog, fluid cream, yogurt, cottage cheese andcanned milk, Miller said. Collectively, they use the equivalent ofabout 11 billion pounds of milk each year and have a farm value ofabout $1 billion.   Miller, in a report and a telephone interview, said U.S.commercial use of milk in 1987 was a record of about 136 billionpounds and that this year's consumption probably will edge stillhigher.   Although Miller said he had no breakdown showing how much eggnogcounted in the group of lesser items, sales figures indicate thateggnog has grown in popularity, more than doubling between 1970 and1987.   ``Some growth in eggnog sales has come from use outside theholiday season,'' Miller said.   At one time, milk processors started selling eggnog just beforeThanksgiving and quit in late December. Today, he said, some eggnogprocessors begin selling for Halloween and continue through theholidays. Sales are sometimes resumed for a brief Easter season.   But it will take more than merriment around the holiday eggnogbowl to keep pace with American dairy farmers.   Miller told the USDA's recent outlook conference that milkproduction this year is expected to rise 2 percent to another recordlevel of around 145 billion pounds. Production declined slightly in1987 to 142.5 billion pounds from the record in 1986 of 143.5billion pounds.   ``The new record was reached because of an increase of almost 3percent in milk per cow,'' he said. The number of cows in productionthis year was estimated at 10.2 million, down 1 percent from 1987and the fewest on record.   Miller said there are a lot of variables ahead for 1989,including feed costs and other factors. Even so, total milk outputnext year ``may be about the same'' as in 1988, while commercial usemay be up 1 percent to 3 percent.   Another factor in the dairy business has been the increase in useof fluid cream, with sales rising by three-fourths between 1970 and1987, he said. Whipping cream more than doubled, while half-and-halfand light cream showed similar gains.   Miller added that ``yogurt has received a great deal ofattention'' because of its popularity among weight watchers andother consumers. Last year, he said, yogurt sales were up sixfoldfrom 1970, but he added that the U.S. yogurt market was tiny beforethe introduction of sweetened, fruit-flavored brands.   ``Lost in the excitement about yogurt's rapid growth is therealization that yogurt remains a minor use of milk,'' Miller said.``Growth in yogurt sales since 1970 has contributed considerablyless to farm milk demand than have increases in fluid cream use.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Britain and Northern Ireland rank well behindJapan and some of the other giant importers of U.S. agriculturalproducts, but the Agriculture Department says they show goodpotential for growth.   The market includes 57 million inhabitants, about 77 percent ofwhom live in urban areas on a total land mass of 150,000 squaremiles, or about the size of Oregon. Collectively Britain andNorthern Ireland make up the United Kingdom.   Admission to the European Economic Community in 1973 gave theU.K. increased exposure to ``Euro-continental'' food brands, thedepartment's Foreign Agricultural Service said in a recent tradereport.   ``Nonetheless, Britain possesses a strong food productioncapability as well as a taste for traditional food items, althoughthe latter is changing along with consumer lifestyles,'' the reportsaid. ``Seafood, meat, dairy and grain products produced orprocessed in the United Kingdom remain popular while North Americanand Asian food items perform well within certain market segments.''   The report noted a number of economic characteristics that makethe United Kingdom attractive to exporting countries. Between 1983and 1986, for example, per capita disposable income grew by 19.5percent. Total national spending on food rose by 12 percent duringthe same period.   ``Growth in food-related spending appears consistent with thegeneral direction of the U.K. economy,'' the report said.   Last year, it said, agricultural imports totaled $18.5 billion,with the U.S. market share at 6 percent, or about $1.1 billion.Meanwhile, U.S. imports of agricultural products from the UnitedKingdom were valued at $367 million last year.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wayne Boutwell, president of the NationalCouncil of Farmer Cooperatives, has been named leader of a U.S.agricultural trade and development mission to two African countriesnext year.   The Agriculture Department mission, which will include at leasthalf a dozen other members, will visit Kenya and the Ivory Coast,probably in February, although officials said the exact dates haveto be negotiated.   Similar missions were carried out this year to the Philippines,Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Mexico as part of a program toboost farm trade with designated countries.</TEXT></DOC>
