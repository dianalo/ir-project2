(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Gaston Caperton today invited theheads of the Pittston Co., the nation's largest coal exporter, andthe miners' union to the governor's mansion to resume negotiationsin a violent, 2{-month strike.   ``Only two parties can end this strike _ Pittston and the UnitedMine Workers,'' Caperton said at a breakfast meeting of the NationalCoal Association convention at the Greenbrier resort in WhiteSulphur Springs.   He asked UMW President Richard Trumka and Paul Douglas, chairmanof the Pittston Co., to resume negotiations Monday. About 1,900 UMWmembers have been on strike at Pittston Coal Group mines inVirginia, West Virginia and Kentucky since April 5 over wage andbenefit disputes.   Pittston has declared an impasse in contract negotiations and hasbegun implementing its own contract at its operations. Neither thecompany nor the union immediately responded to the invitation.   Wildcat walkouts in sympathy with the Pittston strike began lastweek in West Virginia and have spread to nine other states toinclude more than 43,000 miners.   Company efforts to obtain authorities' help in getting wildcatstrikers back to work have met with mixed success.   In Ohio today, about 100 miners returned to the Saginaw Mine nearSt. Clairsville after the company filed a complaint with theNational Labor Relations Board.   But in West Virginia, miners have defied several back-to-workorders. This morning, U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp met withlawyers for 13 companies seeking back-to-work orders, but postponedformal hearings on those requests and on five company motions thatthe union and its officials and members be held in contempt of courtfor ignoring his previous orders.   A group of community leaders and state legislators planned to askKnapp to remove himself, claiming he is biased in favor of coalcompanies.   Knapp on Wednesday fined six UMW locals, their officers andmembers and ordered U.S. marshals to serve pickets with copies ofhis order. The fines will increase each day the locals, officers andunion members are in violation of the order.   Striking miners in Kentucky this morning overturned a jeep drivenby a Pittston mine manager, one day after a strike sympathizer wasgrazed by a bullet at a West Virginia mine.   More than 200 strikers surrounded the Eastern Coal Corp. officenear Stone, Ky., this morning after rumors circulated that thecompany's mine would resume operations Monday with replacementworkers. The workers who rolled a jeep onto its driver's side saidthey were trying to turn back the mine manager. They later rightedthe jeep and the man drove off; it was not immediately known if hewas injured.   In Johnstown, Pa., roving pickets turned away about 600 UnitedSteelworkers members today at a Bethlehem Steel Corp. plant thatmakes railroad coal cars, the company said.   The pickets were not identified. They were presumed to be some ofthe estimated 6,900 UMW members off the job in Pennsylvania.   Virginia also appeared likely to become a focus of confrontationas Pittston Coal Group President Michael Odom confirmed Thursdaythat some salaried workers will be moved there from West Virginia,where the strike has crippled mines. A union representative said theWest Virginia strikers would cross the state line to try to avertany use of replacement workers.   In U.S. District Court in Clarksburg, Judge William Kidd onThursday said he would rule soon on Consolidation Coal Co.'spetition to force miners from six north-central West Virginia localsto return to work.   Back-to-work orders also are being sought by companies in Alabamaand Pennsylvania, and Consolidation has said it plans to seeksimilar legal action in Illinois and Ohio.   The estimated number of miners involved in unauthorized walkouts,according to union and industry officials, are: West Virginia16,000; Illinois, 8,000; Pennsylvania, 6,600; Alabama, 5,000; Ohio,2,660; Kentucky, 2,325; Indiana, 1,750; Virginia, 755; Missouri,350; and Tennessee, 200.</TEXT></DOC>
