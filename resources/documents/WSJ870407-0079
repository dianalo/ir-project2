The project would include a capital investment of $87.7 million by Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co. based here, which would hold a 20% stake in the project. It would also include $77.4 million from Rosemead, Calif.-based Southern California Edison Co., which would have an 18% stake, and $13 million from San Diego Gas andamp; Electric Co., which would have a 3% stake, according to a spokesman for PGandamp;E. Finance and administration costs of $72 million would be shared by the utilities based on their ownership shares.    The utilities would hold a total stake of 41% in the project, with the rest to be shared by numerous California municipal and government-owned utilities.    The project, which would carry 1.6 million kilowatts of electricity, is scheduled to be completed in 1991. </TEXT></DOC>
