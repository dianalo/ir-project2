Conventional      catalytic converters utilize a ceramic honeycomb monolith having square,      circular, or triangular straight-through openings or cells, with catalyst      deposited on the walls of the cells, catalyst coated refractory metal      oxide beads or pellets, e.g., alumina beads, or a corrugated thin metal      foil monolith, e.g., a ferritic stainless steel foil having a catalyst      carried on or supported by the surface. The catalyst is normally a noble      metal, e.g., platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, or a mixture of two      or more of such metals. The catalyst catalyzes a chemical reaction, mainly      oxidation, whereby the pollutant is converted to a harmless by-product      which then passes through the exhaust system to the atmosphere. </PAR><PAR>  However, conversion is not efficient initially when the exhaust gases are      relatively cold. To be effective at a high conversion rate, the catalyst      and the surfaces of the converter with which the gases come in contact      must be at a minimum temperature, e.g., 390 F. for carbon monoxide, 570 F.      for volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 1000 F. for methane or natural      gas. Otherwise, conversion to harmless by-products is poor and cold start      pollution of the atmosphere is high. Once the exhaust system has come to      its operating temperature, the catalytic converter is optimally effective.      Hence, it is necessary to contact relatively cold exhaust gases with hot      catalyst to effect satisfactory conversion at engine start-up. Both      compression ignited (diesel) and spark ignited engines have this need. </PAR><PAR>  To achieve initial heating of the catalyst prior to engine start-up, there      is provided an electrically heatable catalytic converter formed of a      corrugated thin metal monolith which is connected to a voltage source,      e.g., a 12 volt to 108 volt automotive battery, and power supplied,      preferably before, during, and possibly after start-up, to elevate and      maintain the temperature of the catalyst to at least 650 F. plus or minus      20 F. </PAR><PAR>  Copending application Ser. No. 587,219 filed Sep. 24, 1990 and its parent      case Ser. No. 524,284 filed Apr. 16, 1990, disclose one form of      electrically heatable catalytic converter which has been found to be      subject to telescoping of the core, and each provides a means for      offsetting the tendency to telescoping of the core in operation and      ultimate destruction thereof under Hot Shake automotive tests. The      disclosure of Ser. No. 587,219 is incorporated herein by reference      thereto. Reference may also be had to Ser. No. 626,672 filed Dec. 12, 1990      which discloses a further improvement in resistance to telescoping by      brazing between contiguous leaves whereby the leaves or convolutions are      held against telescoping or axial displacement. The foregoing applications      are commonly owned with the present application. </PAR><PAR>  Copending application Ser. No. 606,130 filed Oct. 31, 1990 by William A.      Whittenberger and entitled Electrically Heatable Catalytic Converter, and      commonly owned with the present application, discloses a means for      preventing telescoping of a spiral or S-wound corrugated thin metal foil      monolith by brazing between the corrugated leaves according to a pattern      (staggered relation). In that application, all of the leaves forming the      monolith are corrugated. The adjacent leaves or strips are in nonnesting      relationship by virtue of (1) pattern corrugations, such as herringbone      corrugations, or (2) straight-through corrugations using corrugated leaves      with straight cells of differing pitch. (See U.S. Pat. No. 4,810,588 dated      Mar. 7, 1989 to Bullock) </PAR><PAR>  This application also comtemplates the use of a collimator device in      combination with reinforced foils such as disclosed in co-pending      application Ser. No. 696,132 filed May 6, 1991, commonly owned with the      present application. In Ser. No. 696,132, at least one longitudinal edge,      optionally both longitudinal edges, of the foil is folded over through 180      degrees a distance of from 5% to 25% of the final width of the strip prior      to corrugation to reinforce the edge and reduce the tendency to folding      over under the Hot Shake Test. </PAR><PAR>  Reference may be had to U.S. Pat. No. 4,381,590 dated May 3, 1983 to      Nonnenmann et al which discloses a spirally wound monolith made up of      corrugated and flat continuous strips which are brazed together. No      collimator device such as here employed, is disclosed. However, the basic      regular uniform pitch corrugated foil strip backed up with a flat strip      and spirally wound, as described therein, may be used herein. </PAR><PAR>  Reference may also be had to U.S. Pat. No. 3,768,982 to Kitzner dated Oct.      30, 1973. In this patent, heat from a centrally located electric heater is      transferred by conduction through a monolithic catalyst support to heat      the catalyst to a desired temperature. Reference may also be had to U.S.      Pat. No. 3,770,389 to Kitzner dated Oct. 30, 1973 which discloses a      central electrically heated core within a ceramic monolith, heat being      transmitted by conduction to the catalyst contained in the openings of the      ceramic monolith. The heating core is formed of metal sheets, one      corrugated, the other flat, coated with alumina and bearing a catalyst.      The metallic core is heated electrically by virtue of its own electrical      resistance. Heating of the ceramic core by conduction takes too long to      solve the problem of atmospheric pollution at start-up. The metallic cores      are subject to telescoping under the conditions of the Hot Shake test. </PAR><PAR>  The Hot Shake test involves oscillating (100 to 200 Hertz and 28 to 60 G      inertial loading) the device in a vertical attitude at high temperature      (between 700 and 950 C.; 1292 to 1742 F., respectively) with exhaust gas      from a running internal combustion engine being passed through the device.      If the electrically heatable catalytic device telescopes in the direction      of gas flow or breaks up after a predetermined time, e.g., 5 to 200 hours,      the device is said to fail the test. Usually, a test device will fail in 5      hours if it is going to fail. Five hours is equivalent to 1.8 million      cycles at 100 Hertz. </PAR><PAR>  Reference may also be had to U.S. Pat. No. 4,711,009 to Cornelison et al      dated Dec. 8, 1987 for details of a process for corrugating thin metal      foil strips. Brazing cannot be satisfactorily done over a refractory metal      oxide coated and catalyst bearing surface. Hence, in the present case, the      refractory metal oxide/catalyst coating must be removed from those regions      of the strip undergoing brazing or spot welding, for example, by wire      brushing. The corrugating of a thin metal foil strip with a herringbone or      chevron pattern as taught therein is applicable to the present invention      and hence, the disclosure of the aforesaid U.S. Pat. No. 4,711,009 is      incorporated herein by reference. Alumina wash coating and catalyst      application, using materials disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,711,009, may be      done after brazing by a dipping process, if desired. </PAR><PAR>  Ordinarily the thickness of the foil strip has been in the range of from      0.001&quot; to 0.005&quot; with a preference for 0.0015&quot;. It has been found that      increasing the preferred thickness up to 0.0016&quot; to 0.0019&quot; aids in      reducing the tendency to fold over under the Hot Shake Test. The      corrugations generally have an amplitude of from 0.02&quot; to 0.25&quot; and a      pitch of from 0.02&quot; to 0.2&quot;. The cross-sectional shape of the corrugations      may be triangular, truncated triangular, triangular with the apices      rounded, wave-like, e.g., sinusoidal, etc. The pattern of corrugation may      be herringbone or chevron with a slope of from 3 degrees to 10 degrees to      a line perpendicular to the edges of the foil strip, or they may be      straight through according to a variable pitch pattern (Bullock et al,      supra) or if, the foil is to be backed up with a flat foil strip, a      uniform straight-through pattern with the corrugations lying along lines      perpendicular to the longitudinal edges of the foil strip. Generally the      pitches at the higher end of the range, e.g., 0.1 to 0.15&quot; are desired in      the present case. </PAR><PAR>  Reference may also be had to International PCT publication numbers WO      89/10471 and WO 89/10470 each filed Nov. 2, 1989. S-wound cores composed      of corrugated and flat strips in alternating relation are disclosed in      these publications. However, there is no teaching of the use of a      collimator device therein, and telescoping of the core can occur under the      conditions of the test described above. </PAR><PAR>  In the following description, reference will be made to &quot;ferritic&quot;      stainless steel. A suitable formulation for this alloy is described in      U.S. Pat. No. 4,414,023 to Aggen dated Nov. 8, 1983. A specific ferritic      stainless steel useful herein contains 20% chromium, 5% aluminum, and from      0.002% to 0.05% of at least one rare earth metal selected from cerium,      lanthanum, neodymium, yttrium, and praseodymium, or a mixture of two or      more thereof, balance iron and trace steel making impurities. </PAR><PAR>  In the following description, reference will also be made to fibrous      ceramic mat or insulation. Reference may be had to U.S. Pat. No. 3,795,524      dated Mar. 5, 1974 to Sowman for formulations and manufacture of ceramic      fibers and mats useful herein. One such ceramic fiber material is      currently commercially available from 3-M under the registered trademark      &quot;INTERAM.&quot; </PAR><PAR>  Electrically heatable catalytic converters of the spirally wound type      exhibit two types of mechanical failure when subjected to automobile      durability tests, such as, the &quot;hot shake&quot; test. Telescoping failure can      be largely eliminated by proper design of the monolith, such as shown, for      example, in commonly owned copending application Ser. No. 626,672 filed      Dec. 12, 1990, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by      reference. The second type of failure, which is called &quot;face separation,&quot;      is a condition where face portions of successive convolutions of a      spirally wound metal monolith bend over and/or part under the influence of      high speed gas flow and tend to obstruct gas flow. This condition is not      acceptable. </PAR><PAR>  It has been found that by positioning a protective element just upstream,      i.e., axially within from 0.1 inch plus or minus 0.05 inch to 1.5 inch      plus or minus 0.2&quot; hereinafter &quot;from about 0.1 inch to about 1.5 inch,&quot;      face separation can be eliminated. The protective element straightens out      and evens the fluid flow pattern presented to the face of the electrically      heatable catalytic converter, hereinafter &quot;EHC,&quot; so that only axial forces      act on the EHC. Thus, bending or folding of the leading edges of the foil      convolutions is avoided. </PAR><PAC>  BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Briefly stated, the present invention is an improved catalytic converter      for an exhaust stream comprising an electrically heatable catalytic      converter comprising (a) a corrugated thin metal polycellular monolith,      said monolith having an upstream gas intercepting face, a plurality of gas      transmitting cells opening in said face, and a catalyst deposited on the      gas contacting surfaces of said cells, and (b) a collimator for said      exhaust stream axially spaced upstream of said gas intercepting face      whereby the gas flow is straightened and subdivided prior to entry into      the corrugated thin metal polycellular monolith. </PAR><PAR>  The collimator may be a corrugated thin metal monolith, preferably with      straight-through cells as shown in Nonnenmann et al, supra. Alternatively,      a metal plate from approximately 1/8th inch thick to about 3/8ths inch      thick pierced with many holes may be used. Also, it has been found that a      coarse porous ceramic plate such as produced by Selee Corp. of      Hendersonville, NC, may be used with satisfactory results. The corrugated      thin metal monolith collimator and the porous ceramic plate are from 1/2      to 11/2 inch thick plus or minus 1/8 inch, or &quot;about&quot; 1/2 to about 11/2      inch thick. Collimators of expanded metal or wire cloth may be used. The      collimators hereof may also include a catalyst carried within the cells      thereof. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The invention may be better understood by having reference to the annexed      showing several embodiments of the invention and wherein: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a front cross-sectional view of a current EHC without a      collimator as it appears in the plane indicated by the line 1--1 in FIG.      2. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is an axial cross sectional view of the converter of FIG. 1 without      a collimator. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a front cross-sectional view of the EHC of FIG. 1 with a drilled      plate collimator in place upstream of the EHC as it appears in the plane      indicated by the line 3--3 in FIG. 4. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is an axial cross-sectional view of the converter of FIGS. 1 and 2      with the drilled plate collimator in place upstream of the EHC. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a front cross-sectional view of the EHC of FIG. 1 with a porous      ceramic plate collimator in place upstream of the EHC as it appears in the      plane indicated by the line 5--5 in FIG. 6. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is an axial cross-sectional view of the EHC of FIGS. 1 and 2 with a      porous ceramic collimator in place upstream of the EHC. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a front cross-sectional view of the EHC of FIG. 1 with a      corrugated thin metal monolith collimator in place upstream of the EHC as      it appears in the plane indicated by the line 7--7 in FIG. 8. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is an axial cross-sectional view of the EHC of FIGS. 1 and 2 with a      corrugated thin metal monolith collimator in place upstream of the EHC. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is an axial cross-sectional view of an EHC in accordance with this      invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  As indicated above, the present invention provides a different means for      inhibiting &quot;fold-over failure,&quot; or &quot;face separation&quot; of the leading edges      of corrugated thin metal foil monoliths under the severe &quot;Hot Shake Test&quot;      described above. Instead of reinforcing the leading edge and optionally      the trailing edge of the foil strips as described in copending application      Ser. No. 696,132 filed May 6, 1991, a different means operative on the gas      stream is provided. Normally, the exhaust gas stream is highly turbulent,      twisting and moving at a high velocity. The purpose of the present      invention is to break up the turbulent stream into smaller streams,      desirably axially flowing, prior to entry into the EHC monolith. In this      way, the forces tending to overfold the leading edge, for example, of the      corrugated thin metal monolith are minimized and rendered ineffective to      cause overfolding, and the resulting device is able to pass the &quot;Hot Shake      Test.&quot; </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, there is here shown in transaxial and axial      cross-section, respectively, partial views of an EHC, wherein parts not      essential for full understanding of the present invention, e.g., end caps      and adapters for the exhaust pipe, negative terminal, etc. are omitted.      For a full view of an EHC in accordance with this invention, reference may      be had to FIG. 9 of the drawings. FIGS. 1 and 2 do not show modification      of the device in accordance with this invention, showing instead a basic      EHC prior to modification hereunder. </PAR><PAR>  In FIGS. 1 and 2, there is shown an EHC generally indicated at 10 having a      housing 12, an inner layer of fibrous ceramic mat 14 and a core 16. The      core 16 is formed of a plurality of core elements 18 of corrugated thin      ferritic stainless steel welded to and spirally wound about a central      tubular post 20 plugged at one end with a plug 22. The post is provided at      its downstream end 24 with a diametral bar 26 welded to the post 20 and at      its ends to the housing 12 and to which a cable (not shown) from the      negative side of a voltage source (not shown) may be attached. The bundle      of spirally wound core elements 18 is retained in a stainless steel or      nickel retainer 28 welded or brazed to the free ends of the core elements      18. There is also shown a terminal post 30 welded at its inner end 32 to      the outside of the retainer or shell 28, extending through an opening 34      in the housing 12 and suitably insulated therefrom by a ceramic sleeve 36      and retained by a flange 38 welded to the housing 12. A better form      providing for the positive terminal is shown in FIG. 9, the forms shown in      FIGS. 1-8 being simplified for illustrative purposes. When power is      supplied across the positive and negative terminals, from a direct current      voltage source, the core 16 is electrically heated. A suitable power      supply and control system is fully described in copending application Ser.      No. 587,219 supra. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a front cross-sectional view of an EHC such as shown in FIGS. 1      and 2 fitted with a drilled plate collimator. Like parts will be      identified with the same numbers as in FIGS. 1 and 2. In FIG. 3, there is      shown in front elevational view a stainless steel or nickel plate type      collimator 40 circumferentially welded to the housing 12 as at 42. The      collimator 40 is 1/16th&quot; to 1/4&quot; thick, preferably 1/8&quot; thick, and has a      plurality of holes 44 drilled therethrough. These may be randomly drilled      or drilled on concentric circles. The holes are from 1/16th inch to 3/16th      inch in diameter plus or minus 1/32 inch. With the plate 40 welded in      place, there is no need for the bar 26 as shown in FIG. 2. One pole of the      voltage source is connected to the chassis of the vehicle and thus      indirectly to the EHC, or directly to the housing 12. The open area of the      drilled plate is at least 50%. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 5 and 6 show another embodiment of the present invention utilizing a      porous ceramic collimator. Thus, there is provided a porous ceramic      collimator 46. This collimator may be a commercial ceramic foam currently      available from Selee Corp., supra, having a range of pore sizes from, for      example, 0.01&quot; to 0.15&quot; in diameter in a single block. As shown in FIG. 5,      the block is circular although it may be oval, square, or any geometric      configuration desired. Instead of a porous ceramic foam, the ceramic      collimator may be a section of a conventional ceramic converter body which      is usually formed by extrusion, and which has straight-through cells of      circular, hexagonal, square, triangular, rectangular, or other geometric      cross-section. The block in either case has an axial thickness of from 0.5      to 1.5&quot;, e.g., 1.0&quot;. A noble metal catalyst may be deposited in the pores      and cells of either the ceramic foam, or the extruded ceramic core. As in      FIGS. 2 and 4, the direction of gas flow is indicated by the arrow in FIG.      6. In order to convey power to the inside of the core 16, there must be      provided suitable means, such as the diametral bar 26 welded to the      central post 20, capped with the plug 22. Power is supplied to the housing      12 indirectly through the chassis or directly through a cable, (not shown)      attached to a suitable terminal (not shown) directly attached to the      housing 12. The ceramic collimator is set directly in the ceramic mat 14.      The EHC components are the same as indicated in FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 7 and 8 show another embodiment of the present invention wherein the      collimator is in the form of a corrugated thin metal monolith 48. This      collimator 48 may be of the same structure as the core 16 of FIGS. 1 and 2      or, as shown in FIG. 7, a composite core or alternating corrugated thin      metal strips 50 and flat metal strips 52, preferably brazed together. The      collimator is, again, from about 1/2 to about 11/2&quot; thick in an axial      direction. It completely covers the gas intercepting face 54 of the EHC      core 16. The collimator is provided with a steel retaining shell 56 which      is circumferentially welded or brazed to the housing 12. The central core      20 is axially extended in FIG. 8 to and through the collimator 48 and is      welded thereto. Because the collimator element 48 being all metal is      electrically conducting, there is no need for the current carrying      diametral bar 26 shown, for example, in FIGS. 2 and 6. However, a bar 26      may be found desirable for mechanical support. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 shows a complete EHC assembly embodying the ceramic collimator of      FIGS. 5 and 6. FIG. 9 is an axial cross-section of a completely assembled      EHC generally indicated at 119, in accordance herewith and adapted to be      inserted in an exhaust line from an internal combustion engine. The      converter is provided with a stainless steel or nickel housing 120 having      flared end caps 122 and 124, and nipples 126 and 128 integral therewith      adapted to accommodate a standard exhaust pipe, e.g., a 2.5&quot; internal      diameter pipe. The housing 120 contains a corrugated thin metal monolith      indicated at 130 such as, for example, a monolith such as shown in FIG. 6      with a collimator 157 in spaced axial relationship to the gas intercepting      face 159 of the monolith 130. The monolith 130 can be formed in the manner      indicated in co-pending application Ser. No. 680,763, filed Apr. 5, 1991      by Cornelison and Whittenberger. The core is a refractory metal oxide      coated, e.g., alumina/ceria, corrugated thin ferritic stainless steel      having a noble metal catalyst, e.g., platinum, deposited on the surface.      The core 130 defines a plurality of generally axially extending cells 133      permeable to exhaust gas. Such cells 133 are diagrammatically shown as a      plurality of parallel lines. As indicated above, these cells 133      non-straight-through as produced with a herringbone or chevron corrugation      pattern, or straight-through variable pitch or uniform pitch as described      in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,810,588 and 4,381,590, supra. The refractory metal      oxide coating is very thin, e.g., from 0.0005&quot; to 0.002&quot; applied as a      washcoat and baked to fuse the coating to the stainless steel surface. The      gamma form of alumina is desired. Other refractory metal oxides or      mixtures of such oxides may be used as the washcoat, e.g., titania,      titania/ceria, titania/alumina, alumina/ceria, etc. As indicated above,      reference may be had to U.S. Pat. No. 4,711,009, supra, for a procedure      for corrugating, washcoating, and application of a noble metal catalyst to      the foil. Strips 132 of the corrugated ferritic stainless steel foil are      cut to a predetermined length and 1 or more such strips 132 are secured to      the central post 134 as by welding. A button 136 is provided to close the      tube 134. The strips 132, which may be uniformly a corrugated strip or, a      composite of two or more strips, e.g., corrugated and flat, or corrugated,      flat and brazing, are then tightly wound about the central post 134 to      which post 134 they are welded or brazed after removal of the refractory      metal oxide coating in the area where welding or brazing occurs. The      alumina coating must also be removed from the free ends of the strips 132.      The whole bundle of spirally wound strips 132 is then wrapped in a strip      of brazing foil, and a retaining shell 138, preferably as two half shells,      one of which has a suitable terminal post 140 extending therefrom for      attachment of a cable 150 from a suitable voltage source. The half shells      are seam welded together. The assembly is heated to fusion temperature for      the brazing strip to effect brazing to the retaining shell 138. If the      brazing temperature, generally from 2100 to 2300 F., is found to be too      high for the catalyst, application of the catalyst may be deferred until      after the brazing step, and the catalyst subsequently applied by dipping      and baking at a lower temperature. </PAR><PAR>  This assembly is then wrapped in insulation 142 desirably 1/16 to 3/8&quot;      thick and inserted into the housing 120. The housing may, for convenience,      be formed as half shells to be seam welded together. A suitable ceramic      felt is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,916,057 to Hatch dated Oct. 28, 1975.      The insulation 142 extends axially a distance sufficient to accommodate      the collimator 157 which is now put in place. The assembly is compressed      and seam welded together. The end caps 122 and 124 are the last to be      attached as by welding. A thermocouple having a junction 196 may      optionally be placed within the core 130 to sense temperature. The leads      194 pass through an insulator 146 and a bushing 148 extending through the      end cap 124. </PAR><PAR>  The terminal post 140 extends through the housing 120 and is desirably      threaded at its distal extemity to accept a nut (not shown) to attach a      cable schematically shown at 150 leading through a switch 152 and a power      switching means 154 such as described in copending application Ser. No.      587,219, supra. The power switching means 154 is connected to a battery      156 or an alternator, or both, to provide a driving force or voltage of      from 12 to 108 volts. The post 140 is provided with an insulating sleeve      158, a bushing 160 and a metal cap 162 serving as a seat for the cable      connector, not shown. </PAR><PAR>  The opposite, or negative pole in this case, is connected from the outside      of the housing 120 by a transversely extending, or diametral bar 164      welded at each end to the inside of the housing 120 and to which the      central post 134 is welded as at 166. The chassis is grounded or negative.      Thus, the electrical circuit is completed from the central post 134,      through the corrugated foil, 130, through the retaining shell 138 and      terminal 140. </PAR><PAR>  The cell density is conveniently in the range of from 75 to 500 cells per      square inch, desirably from 100 to 350 cells per square inch, and      preferably from 125 to 200 cells per square inch. </PAR><PAR>  The catalytic converters hereof are referred to as &quot;electrically heatable.&quot;      This is to suggest that electric power is supplied for a small portion of      the time the engine is at rest prior to start-up, and if necessary, during      operation at any time the temperature falls below a set point. </PAR><PAR>  It has been found that inclusion of the collimators of the present      invention and equivalent devices is very satisfactory for solving the      problem of folding over, or face separation, and failure by reason of such      damage to the core undergoing a severe automotive test such as the hot      shake test described above. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
