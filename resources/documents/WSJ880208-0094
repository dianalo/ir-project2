There's actually a connection between the first two events and the third. Mr. Gore, who made a strategic decision to ignore the first presidential contest this year and is therefore taking a political beating in Iowa, doesn't want to be left out of the spotlight. So his handlers dreamed up a weeklong frenzy of made-for-television activity in the sunny South -- where Mr. Gore is strongest and hopes to do well in the Super Tuesday contests March 8 -- to try to take a bit of the attention away from frostbitten Iowa.    &quot;This is purely substance,&quot; the Tennessee Democrat says with an almost straight face. &quot;If you have the idea that this is designed to divert the media's attention from the Iowa caucuses, I'm shocked.&quot;    In a year in which 13 presidential aspirants are jockeying for position, competition is intense to come up with events that will be irresistible to the TV cameras. Politicians have a term for this: &quot;free media.&quot; Which is not to be confused with advertising, or &quot;paid media.&quot; Free media has several advantages over the alternative. It's not just that it costs nothing. It is also more credible to have the campaign's message treated as news, rather than a commercial.    &quot;Let me put it this way,&quot; says Republican media consultant Robert Goodman. &quot;In a presidential race, free media is everything.&quot;    Especially for Sen. Gore, who must worry that all the publicity enjoyed by the winners in Iowa and New Hampshire could all but drown him out. So he is trying his hardest to get what notice he can, whenever he can, however he can.    The centerpiece of Sen. Gore's efforts is &quot;Escape from Iowa,&quot; a seven-city tour designed to lure reporters and TV crews with promises of fun in the sun. The idea for the trip was that of Michael Kopp, a 28-year-old deputy press secretary with a background in local TV news.    The senator's campaign staff tossed around ideas about where to go on this odyssey. James Free, a senior adviser on political strategy, suggested stops in important congressional districts, but Mr. Kopp groaned and reminded the brainstormers of the purpose of the trip: &quot;Visuals, visuals, visuals.&quot;    In a project such as this, pictures take precedence over policy. It was only after someone came up with the idea of having the candidate visit a Dalton, Ga., carpet mill that the campaign put together a speech on textile policy. (Alas, the mill visit had to be canceled when bad weather kept the candidate's plane from landing.)    Plans to have Mr. Gore greeted at the Orlando Airport by Walt Disney World's Mickey Mouse or Sea World's Shamu the Killer Whale also had to be scrubbed. The theme parks didn't want their characters identified with a particular candidate. Mr. Gore had to settle for a greeting from a man in an alligator suit jumping up and down on the airstrip.    Another proposal for the activities scheduled for today had Mr. Gore touring the Luray Caverns in western Virginia. But Mr. Kopp didn't like the potential implications: &quot;I can just see it -- Gore buries himself on the day he loses Iowa.&quot;    Despite the false starts, successful gimmicks were found. Enticed by a brochure suggesting, &quot;Why not let your imagination drift off to sugar-white beaches, or stroll through gardens where flowers bloom in February?&quot; more than 30 journalists signed on for at least part of the trip. The press turnout was more than twice that for any previous Gore trip; the three major networks sent people; and the local media, especially television, were at every stop.    A successful media event requires imagination and good contacts. For a stop one day in Tampa, the Gore staff hit upon a way to use Tampa Bay as a prop. Since Mr. Gore likes to stress his record as an environmentalist, the campaign contacted Michael Perry, a marine biologist who is working to bring the once-polluted waterway back to life. A campaign advance man then looked over sites with Mr. Perry. The result: a sunset shot of the candidate, wearing waist-high rubber waders, planting mangrove trees in the bay. (Mangroves are supposed to provide nutrients and shelter for little fishes.)    In a sunrise jog on the Fort Lauderdale beach, the 39-year-old Sen. Gore is accompanied by three dozen TV camera crews and photographers trying to maneuver in the sand. &quot;I'm looking forward to the solitude of the moment, the peaceful time of reflection,&quot; says the candidate, who is wearing shorts, a &quot;Dad, we love you&quot; T-shirt and a wireless microphone from NBC.    When the TV cameramen motion for him to run closer to the water, Sen. Gore readily complies, the waves rolling up to his feet. As he ends his jog, a man runs in front of him and yells to the cameras, &quot;Go, Bruce Babbitt!&quot; Unwilling to be upstaged by that, Sen. Gore takes off his shoes and socks and wades out into the water to gaze at the orange sunrise. &quot;He's great at posing,&quot; says Jill Valenstein, a CBS political coordinator.    During a Gore appearance at the Georgia state capitol in Atlanta, state Sen. Pierre Howard endorses the Tennessee senator, praising Mr. Gore's reported ability to hypnotize chickens. &quot;If he can do that, he can go head-to-head with the Russians,&quot; says Mr. Howard. Sen. Gore, who went to prep school in Washington and Harvard after that, likes to burnish his down-home credentials. He readily confirms that he can hypnotize chickens. The trick, he says, is to hold the bird's head down and then move your finger around in the dirt in front of its face.    The trip is not without mishap, however. An hour of turbulence over Georgia sends everyone to the airsickness bags (except the candidate, who sleeps through it). In Chattanooga, Tenn., where the candidate's plane makes an unscheduled stop because of the weather, it is delayed in taking off because the pilots don't have a credit card to buy fuel and the airport won't take a check. (But the Gore people see in this, too, an opportunity. They phone the local TV stations, all three of which send crews to interview their native son.)    When the food on the plane runs out and mysterious sparks are seen coming from the left wing, the press corps starts plotting its escape from &quot;Escape from Iowa.&quot; &quot;This makes Sherman's march to the sea look like a holiday excursion,&quot; complains Los Angeles Times reporter Bob Drogin. But the Gore campaign is well pleased. Says Mr. Kopp: &quot;We got exactly the kind of images and pictures we wanted.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
