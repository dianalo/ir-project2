KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Secretary of State George P. Shultz saidThursday the 3,200 U.S. combat troops airlifted during the day toCentral America are not there in a ``shooting capacity'' but tosignal opposition to Nicaraguan aggression.   Senior Democrats in Congress quickly questioned PresidentReagan's decision to send the troops, with Senate Majority LeaderRobert C. Byrd Jr., of West Virginia calling it an ``overreaction.''   Officials on both sides of the issue predicted the militarysituation would reignite the controversy over Contra aid that hasdivided Congress for several years. And there was dispute amonglawmakers as to whether Nicaragua had indeed invaded Honduras, thejustification cited for the decision to send U.S. forces.   Shultz told a Senate committee that the troops airlifted toHonduras were dispatched to ``get people's attention to what ishappening in Central America'' and to say to the Hondurangovernment, ``We are your friends. We stand with you.''   But senior Democrats challenged Reagan's justification for theaction.   ``It's an overreaction,'' said Byrd. ``We've heard theadministration cry, `Wolf, wolf,' before. I don't know when they'recrying `wolf, wolf.'''   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, who has supported the peaceplan drafted by President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, said sendingU.S. combat troops to the area was unjustified. He voiced concernthat the White House may have overblown the incident for its ownpurposes.   Not all Democrats agreed, and Senate Republican Leader Bob Doleof Kansas sprang to Reagan's defense, declaring that Contra rebelsare being overrun and ``slaughtered by the hundreds.''   He called on the president to immediately resubmit a package ofmilitary and logistical aid for the Contra rebels and said: ``Doesit make sense, even as thousands of communist troops cross theborder of a free country in this hemisphere, for members ofCongress to make excuses for (Nicaragua's) aggression, whileaccusing the president of the United States of fueling the fires ofwar in Central America?''   Officials of Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government saidtheir troops were not in Honduras, but the administration said itdispatched U.S. forces at the request of Honduran President JoseAzcona. Officials said they received the request because Sandinistaforces were in Honduras threatening to overrun Contra bases.   The Contras have been battling the Managua government forseveral years with the support of the Reagan administration, butU.S. aid to them expired at the end of February and the Houserefused to renew it.   Shultz took note of that as he appeared before the Senate BudgetCommittee. ``Obviously the decision in the House of Representativesto deny aid to the resistance has dealt them _ and in my opiniontha cause of freedom _ a very serious blow,'' he said.   Shultz said the U.S. troops from the Army's 82nd Airborne and7th Light Infantry divisions aren't in Honduras in a ``shootingcapacity.''   ``It is important for people to know the United States willfight, but we don't plan to get involved in any military way,'' hesaid.   Shultz said that as of Wednesday there were 1,600 to 2,000Nicaraguan soldiers across the Honduran border. He said there hadbeen heavy fighting, that two airfields had been seized and thatthe Sandinistas had spearheaded their attacks on Contra forces withairplane and helicopter strikes.   Shultz, noting that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega hadissued a denial of troop presence in Honduras on Wednesday, saidWright had told him he had been called by the Nicaraguan foreignminister and told that the Sandinista troops would be withdrawn.   Underscoring the apparent contradiction, Shultz said: ``I don'tknow which one is lying; maybe both.''   Not all Democrats objected to Reagan's decision to dispatchtroops.   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., said after a classified briefing that``there has clearly been a penetration'' by Sandinista troops ``infair numbers'' into Honduras.   Shultz laid out this scenario:   _Intelligence efforts detected preparations for a Nicaraguanoffensive drive beginning on March 1.   _First contact between the Sandinistas and Contras insideHonduras came on March 10.   _On Tuesday, the Contras reported heavy fighting and attacksfrom Nicaraguan bombers inside Honduras.   _On Wednesday, ``we saw a presence of 1,600 to 2,000 Sandinistatroops'' in Honduras aided by bombers and helicopters.   The Democratic chairman and Republican vice chairman of theSenate Intelligence Committee said after an administration briefingthat Reagan had no choice but to dispatch the troops.   After listening to representatives of the intelligence agenciesand Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, Sen. David Boren,D-Okla., and William Cohen, R-Maine, agreed that a plannedincursion had taken place, not a hot pursuit of Contra forces.   Boren, saying the Contras are ``outnumbered three or four toone,'' told reporters the Sandinistas are ``reading the tea leavesin Congress'' and ``taking a riverboat gamble that they can delivera crushing blow. This was a reaction of the Sandinista governmentto the defeat of Contra aid.   ``The Sandinista government has given its answer to Congress.This is their way of saying, ``Thank you very much. You have takenthe pressure off of us. We think we have this won in Washington.Now we're going to do what we always intended to do and crush theresistance forces.''   Cohen said, ``The administration is responding to a request forpolitical support (from Honduras) at this point.''   But Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said, ``I think the notion thatthere's a real invasion is just ridiculous.   Some members of Congress noted that the deployment came as theadministration was making a renewed push for aid for the Contras.   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said he doubted whether the outcomewill be changed.   `We're very evenly divided in the House and in the Congress onaid, and I don't see that fundamentally changing,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
