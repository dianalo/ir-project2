Americans drink half the company's production of Beefeater gin, but a 200% U.S. tariff threatens to raise the price of a bottle in a New York store to about $18 from $11 at present. The family-run company, a major employer in a depressed South London neighborhood, fears U.S. drinkers will switch to U.S.-distilled gin or even Russian vodka.    &quot;It's going to hurt us tremendously,&quot; says Don Gregory, export director. &quot;It's something I would never have expected to come out of an American government.&quot;    The 200% tariffs, which the U.S. intends to introduce by Jan. 30, are a rude shock to much of the rest of Europe as well. Designed to retaliate against the Common Market for the loss of $500 million of grain exports after Spain joined the group last year, the duties would curb European Community exports of a range of good things to eat and drink, including French brandy, Danish ham, Dutch cheese and Belgian endives.    The tariffs could be averted by last-minute meetings between U.S. and European officials, tentatively set for Jan. 23 in Washington. In talks Wednesday in Bermuda, British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told Secretary of State George Shultz that the duties could have serious consequences for trade relations, according to a British official.    But the two sides remain far apart, and EC officials have yet to figure out how to satisfy the U.S. demands for compensation, an EC spokeswoman in Brussels, Belgium, says. A U.S. spokesman says the EC's latest offer for compensation amounted to &quot;30 cents on the dollar.&quot;    If the U.S. imposes the duties, the EC promises to strike back with additional tariffs against U.S. farm products, escalating a trade war that everyone agrees would be dangerous to the whole world. &quot;This is the most serious protectionist threat we've had for a number of years,&quot; says Ian Henley of the Confederation of British Industry, the British business group.    Europe and the U.S. have neared the brink in trade disputes several times, only to reach last-minute settlements. That could well be the case this time, though usually cynical analysts say the current dispute seems particularly serious. Yet many believe the EC will come up with a response more satisfying to the U.S.    Either way, many Europeans say, divisive trading conflicts are sure to reappear as long as Europe remains locked into its expensive and protectionist agricultural policies.    &quot;This is merely the inevitable outcome of an issue in which governments on both sides of the Atlantic have been very stupid,&quot; says Hugh Corbet, director of the Trade Policy Research Center, a London research group. &quot;It is the sort of thing which was predicted 10 years ago.&quot;    The quarrel stems from Spain's admission to the EC last year. Previously, under a longstanding agreement, the country had imposed a relatively modest 20% duty on U.S. corn. But suddenly, the EC slapped on its variable levy, a tax that generally ranges between 140% and 200%. U.S. farmers lost between $400 million and $500 million in exports.    Under the rules of the Geneva, Switzerland-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, the EC could impose the duty and the U.S. could seek compensation. Neither side disputes either point. But the U.S. considers the EC's most recent compensation offer -- to buy 1.6 million tons of grain a year, compared with the 4.3 million tons of annual exports lost after Spain's EC entry -- a non-starter. Mr. Shultz said in Bermuda that the EC offer wasn't &quot;anything near sufficient.&quot;    The EC claims that with Spanish Common Market membership, the U.S. now enjoys greater access to Spain's market for industrial goods. But the argument is &quot;disingenuous,&quot; says Mr. Corbet of the London research group. Though Spain's tariffs on industrial products from outside the EC are gradually dropping to half the previous level, the levies on goods made in other EC countries are being eliminated, trade analysts say, putting the U.S. at a disadvantage.    The U.S. says it expects to lose exports to Spain, as it did when Greece joined the EC several years ago. Major U.S. exports include aircraft, cigarettes and medical and pharmaceutical equipment.    The U.S. isn't sympathetic to Europe's pleas about how difficult it is to win approval from a dozen governments for a more generous offer. &quot;We in the U.S. have political pressures of our own,&quot; Clayton Yeutter, the U.S. Special Trade Representative, told British business executives last month. &quot;We may not have 12 countries, but we do have 50 states, 100 senators and 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives. . . . And we have economic conflicts within our borders that are similar to the EC's.&quot;    Under GATT rules, the compensation doesn't have to be entirely in the form of increased agricultural imports, although the U.S. has told the Europeans it would like farmers to benefit most because of domestic political pressures. &quot;I can't think what the EC can possibly offer to satisfy American farmers,&quot; Mr. Corbet says. He says the EC ought to promise to change its policies and open its markets on some set timetable. U.S. officials insist that, although they would welcome such moves, in this case they seek specific redress.    The EC does know exactly how it plans to retaliate if the two sides fail to agree; it says it will block U.S. exports of corn-gluten feed, rice and wheat, which are about equal in value to the products targeted by the U.S. The U.S. promises to then respond with more duties, and Europeans say the range of affected products could spread quickly.    Denmark's initial loss of $17 million in sales of ham and cheese may seem minor. But &quot;these initial steps will continue into other products,&quot; says Lars Benkert, head of international affairs at the Federation of Danish Industries in Copenhagen.    Some Europeans hope the trade-war scare, and the devastating consequences that could follow, will speed an overhaul of the agricultural policies that triggered the dispute in the first place. The U.S. and Japan, of course, face messy farm problems as well; the World Bank last year said the developed nations' agricultural policies cost taxpayers $40 billion a year, aggravate Third World poverty and aid only communist nations of Eastern Europe.    Europe's surplus inventories of grain, butter and other subsidized products are huge, with storage costs alone near $4 billion a year. The EC spends more than $22 billion a year to support agriculture. &quot;I think the awareness is growing that the EC cannot continue (its spending habits), because it is simply too crazy,&quot; says Mr. Benkert of the Federation of Danish Industries.    ---              U.S. TRADE WITH THE COMMON MARKET                   (billions of dollars)                     1986*   1985    1984    1983    1982    U.S. Exports     48.5    45.8    47.0    44.3    47.9    U.S. Imports     73.1    68.2    60.3    45.9    44.5    U.S. Balance    -24.6   -22.5   -13.3    -1.6    +3.5   *January-November   Source: Commerce Dept.</TEXT></DOC>
