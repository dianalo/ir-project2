The bioinsecticide, or Cxc-Bt, was developed by Crop GeneticsInternational Corp. of Hanover, Md., and is aimed at controlling theEuropean corn borer, a pest estimated to cost $400 million in lossesannually to the nation's corn crop.   A series of tests was performed in Maryland this year and CropGenetics said it will seek further approval from the AgricultureDepartment and the Environmental Protection Agency to carry outadditional field trials in 1989 at various locations, includingmajor corn areas of the Midwest.   ``The scientific data from our field trials in Maryland confirmsthe environmental safety of our bioinsecticide,'' Peter S. Carlson,chief scientist and co-founder of the company, said Wednesday.   Some environmentalists had feared the bioinsecticide might spreadto other plants or to humans and other animal species.   But Crop Genetics said the Maryland tests showed that Cxc-Bt doesnot multiply or survive outside its host plant. The Cxc part of the``vaccine'' was described as a naturally occurring microorganismwhich can live only inside a plant's vascular system.   The Bt part ``is lethal to the borer but harmless to humans,animals, birds and non-target insects,'' the company said. Theproduct, which the firm calls InCide, is inserted in corn seed,enabling corn plants to grow their own biopesticide against theborer.   Company officials said the 1989 field tests will include yieldand production information to see how well the biopesticide performs.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal audit shows the Farmers HomeAdministration is losing money at a record pace, but a spokesmansays the Agriculture Department agency is in business to helppeople, not make a profit.   The audit by the General Accounting Office says the agency hasbuilt a 40-year deficit of at least $36 billion, of which about $22billion occurred last year.   ``Farmers Home was created by the Congress to do specificthings,'' spokesman Marlyn Aycock said Wednesday. ``I don't think itwas created to make a profit, or else they wouldn't have said wehave to lend to people who can't get money elsewhere.''   The GAO, an investigating agency of Congress, said that sinceFmHA's revolving credit accounts began in 1946, cumulative losseshave amounted to about $59 billion, of which Congress reimbursed theAgriculture Department agency $23 billion.   ``Our opinion on FmHA's statement of financial position reflectsour concerns over the agency's inability to repay its borrowings andto meet its current operations without incurring additional debt andthe magnitude of its accumulated $36 billion deficit, which includes$22 billion for losses recognized in fiscal year 1987,'' saidFrederick D. Wolf, director of GAO's accounting and financialmanagement division.   The agency has its roots in the mid-1930s during the Depressionand is often called the government's lender of last resort forhard-pressed farmers who cannot get credit from banks and othercommercial lenders.   Although farm loans are a key element of FmHA operations, ruralhousing and rural development also are involved.   The GAO audit was for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 1987,and was the first in the agency's history. It was submitted onTuesday to Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng, who is required bylaw to respond to Congress within 60 days.   Aycock said in an interview that as of Sept. 30, 1988, the agencyhad total loans outstanding of about $62 billion. Less than half _$25.5 billion _ was owed under the farm lending programs. Thebalance was loans for rural housing and community development.   Of the total $62 billion in loans, about $9.2 billion weredelinquent. The farm delinquencies represented $8.3 billion of thatamount, Aycock said.   ``Every loan we make is subsidized to one extent or another,'' hesaid. ``Over half of $62 billion loans we've got are made atinterest rates below 5 percent.''   As to GAO's finding that the agency lost $22 billion last year,Aycock said much of that was bookkeeping that the GAO itself hadinsisted upon.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Soviet Union has canceled a further 102,500metric tons of U.S. soybean meal that had been scheduled fordelivery under a recently extended supply agreement between the twocountries, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.   On Tuesday, USDA announced the cancellation of 200,000 tons thathad been bought for 1988-89 delivery to the Soviet Union.   No explanation was given, but officials say that conflicts inshipping schedules or price disagreements have been behind suchcancellations in the past.   The United States and the Soviet Union on Nov. 28 signed anextension of the previous five-year grain agreement, which hadexpired on Sept. 30. The extension of the previous pact will runthrough Dec. 31, 1990.   With the cancellations, the Soviets still have on order 532,500tons of soybean meal and 500,000 tons of soybeans.</TEXT></DOC>
