Yugoslavian Prime Minister Ante Markovic and Milan Kucan,the president of the breakaway republic of Slovenia,reportedly reached an agreement on troop withdrawals lastnight. Under the plan, Yugoslav troops were to return totheir barracks this morning. The two sides have been fightingsince Slovenia and the neighboring republic of Croatiadeclared their independence last week.</LP><TEXT>   At the same time, three foreign ministers from theEuropean Community, for the second time in two days, flew toBelgrade for talks with Yugoslavian leaders and the heads ofthe secessionist republics.   In the capital, meanwhile, Yugoslavia's collectivepresidency elected Croatian Stipe Mesic as head of state, theTanjug news agency reported. The election, which ended asix-week deadlock that had paralyzed the country's topadministrative office, was an objective of the EC mission.   The three EC ministers thought they had brokered acease-fire early Saturday morning. But in the followinghours, the plan steadily unraveled. The army issued anultimatum for the Slovenes to stop fighting. But in theSlovene capital of Ljubljana, officials refused thatultimatum and tensions heightened. Slovene radio warnedpeople to stay inside and head to basements, as therepublic's militia braced for more army and air attacks.   &quot;This is a last-chance journey,&quot; said Jacques Poos, theforeign minister of Luxembourg, as he boarded the plane lastnight, joining the two other ministers, Gianni De Michelis ofItaly and Hans van den Broek of the Netherlands. &quot;If itfails, civil war will break out, and there will be no savingYugoslavia.&quot;   Mr. Poos's fears seemed confirmed at Sentilj, the mainborder crossing at Austria and Slovenia. For five days thecrossing has been closed and under siege. Eight tanks blockthe main road leading to the town of Maribor, Slovenia'ssecond largest city. After Yugoslav jets violated Austrianair space Friday in a bombing raid on barricades outsideMaribor, the Austrians sent up their own jets to patrol theborder and moved troops and several tanks into the nearbyAustrian towns.   In the middle are about 150 Slovene soldiers, determinedto defend Slovenia's independence. &quot;If they want to, they cancrush us,&quot; says one of the soldiers, contemplating theYugoslav army's firepower. &quot;We never thought it would come tothis.&quot;   Neither did most people elsewhere in Europe, whichseemingly paid little heed to the storm clouds building overthe past few months in Yugoslavia, where ethnic tensions weredriving Slovenia and the neighboring republic of Croatiatowards seccession.   The U.S. and European Community have issued regularstatements that Yugoslavia must remain united, threatening tocut off millions of dollars in aid if the country breaks up.Now, that strategy seems to have failed, along with theYugoslav union. And it's doubtful whether the country can bepatched together.   While Slovene and Croatian officials say they are willingto slow down the implementation of independence as part of acease-fire and peacefully negotiate their break fromYugoslavia, they insist they won't relinquish theirsovereignty.   Slovenes and Croatians wonder whether the federalgovernment still has control over the 180,000-strong army,whose officer core is dominated by ethnic Serbs. Thecommunist leadership of the republic of Serbia has stridentlyopposed Slovene and Croatian independence, insisting thatYugoslavia must remain in its present form, with a strongcentral government from Belgrade, which is also the Serbiancapital.   As part of asserting its independence, Slovenia isdetermined to control its two dozen border posts withAustria, Italy and Hungary. Some of the fiercest fighting hastaken place around customs checkpoints. The Slovenes are incontrol of some, the army of others.   Inside Slovenia, many of the roads are impassable, blockedby either the federal or Slovene soldiers, or by Slovenecivilians who have dragged trees and stones onto the roads toprevent the federal army from reaching the border posts. Thehighway from Sentilj to Maribor, usually buzzing withtraffic, is blocked by the army tanks. There were reportsthat some ethnic Slovenes in the federal army were deserting,joining with their rebellious republic.   In Maribor, a defiant population is anxious to hold on toindependence.   &quot;After all that has happened in the past days, we can't goback to the way things were,&quot; says Miha Brecko, the doormanof the Maribor casino. Although the casino has been closedsince the middle of last week, he remains at his post. Acrossthe street, a huge blue-white-red Slovene flag hangs from thecity hall. &quot;That flag,&quot; he says, &quot;is here to stay.&quot;   So far, no foreign countries have recognized Slovene orCroatian independence. This has left Slovenes feelingisolated and disillusioned, for they had counted on Europeanand American support in managing a peaceful breakup ofYugoslavia, which has six republics and two provinces.   &quot;They seem to support self-determination everywhere elseexcept in Yugoslavia,&quot; says Renato Granda, the owner ofParis-Texas, a leather and jeans store in Maribor. &quot;OK, so weare small and America has bigger interests in Europe. But itisn't enough for Washington just to say `We don't want war inYugoslavia.' I don't want war here, either. But just sayingso isn't enough.&quot;   During the relative calm that prevailed in the early hoursafter the EC initiative, Slovene soldiers controlling theJurij border crossing with Austria relaxed at a road-siderefreshment stand, drinking beer and coffee with one hand andholding their rifles with the other. Mention of the U.S. andSecretary of State James Baker, who visited Yugoslavia twoweeks ago, drew a hail of expletives.   What do they expect from America?   &quot;Recognition,&quot; shouts one soldier. &quot;Jet bombers,&quot; saysanother. &quot;The ones you can't see on radar. Ten of them.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
