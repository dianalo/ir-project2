A 10-day waiting period following filing with the Securities andExchange Commission of American Stores' $2.5 billion buyout bid forLucky had expired Wednesday.   However, the Federal Trade Commission asked the Salt LakeCity-based company not to purchase any shares of Lucky stock untilafter 11:59 p.m. EDT Friday so federal regulators could review anypossible antitrust implications of the merger.   In a brief statement released in New York by Executive VicePresident Michael T. Miller, American Stores said the agreementwith the Federal Trade Commission does not affect the timing of its$65 per share cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of LuckyStores, which is scheduled to expire at midnight EDT on June 1.   American Stores officials in Salt Lake City declined to discussthe development, saying they had no comment beyond the preparedstatement.   In New York, Lissa Perlman of Kekst and Co., a public relationsfirm representing Lucky, indicated the delay was not considered aserious one.   ``Things are progressing,'' she said of the buyout agreement.She would not discuss any possible antitrust concerns.   American Stores and Lucky officials announced they had reachedagreement on the buyout May 20. The deal terminated Lucky's April28 deal to go private in a leveraged buyout led by the New Yorkfirm Gibbons, Green van Amerongen Ltd. for $2.35 billion in cashand stock.   Analysts widely have speculated that if American Stores succeedsin acquiring Dublin, Calif.-based Lucky, it will merge the companywith its weaker Alpha Beta chain in California.   In announcing the buyout last week, American Stores ChairmanL.S. Skaggs said his company ``has always considered Lucky to bethe leading supermarket chain in California and is enthusiasticabout the combination of our Alpha Beta operations with those ofLucky.''   Lucky Stores has 480 stores and had $6.4 billion in 1987 sales,while American Stores boasts 1,600 stores and $14.1 billion insales.   Since it defeated a takeover attempt last year by New Yorkinvestor Asher B. Edleman, Lucky has been considered a desireabletakeover target.   In order to hold off Edleman, the company sold off itsnon-grocery divisions, plus stores in Arizona and Florida under arestructuring plan. The company also paid $2.8 million of Edleman'slegal costs in return for his dropping the hostile takeover bid.   To break off its buyout agreement with Gibbons, Green, LuckyStores agreed to pay the firm a $20 million fee plus expenses.   American Stores offer, besides awaiting the outcome of the FTCreview, is subject to a majority of Lucky's 38.6 million sharesbeing tendered. American Stores officials have said they havewritten commitments from commercial banks for all financing needed.</TEXT></DOC>
