What recession? (Mac the Knife) (Rumors) (column)andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>The holiday shopping season now upon us is market capitalism's finest hour,recession or no.andP;  While mainstream retailers gleefully slash prices to lureskittish consumers to squeeze the last drops of juice from credit cards stillmaxed out from selling frenzies past, the Knife reports that Mac dealers aregenerally happy.andM;And who can blame them?andP;  In spite of ongoing shortages of the Mac Classic,the absence of the LC and such otherwise depressing news as the humiliatingpublic collapse of both Milli Vanilli and Margaret Thatcher in the same week(coincidence? you be the judge), retail customers appear to be doing theirbit to keep Apple's coffers bulging.andM;Judging from the Knife's report this week, Apple is doing its part to ensurethat, as we blissfully sail through the '90s, we'll have a host of newproducts to keep our hardware lusts at a fever pitch.andP;  First, if Apple hasits way, Macs of the future will be fast enough to keep the most intenselyType A personalities happy.andP;  Sources tell the Knife that Apple is stilldeeply immersed in RISC (reduced instruction set computing) development,working with several Motorola chips, starting with the RISC 88110.andM;RISC Mac development at this point is still in a relatively early phase, ofcourse, with 1992 pegged as the earliest possible date for a productintroduction.andP;  But according to these sources, the first RISC Macs should bewell worth the delay.andP;  One project that the Knife feels will be critical to asmooth transition to the fast-paced world of RISC computing is 68030emulation.andP;  If Apple's crack engineers are able to pull it off, '030emulation will allow the RISC Macs to run Mac software, a feature that, ifimplemented, will certainly hasten acceptance of the new Macs.andM;So what else does Apple have in mind for the RISC Macs, other than runningexisting software really, really fast?andP;  Speech recognition, for one.andP;  Withthe number of horses under the hood that the engineers are planning,more-sophisticated speech recognition than is currently possible willinevitably lead to optional voice control.andP;  Don't be surprised if the newRISC machines include telephone-management and fax capabilities.andP;  Enhancedvideo compression (300 Mbps) also will ensure some interesting newpossibilities.andM;Print it good.andP;  The Knife has also learned that Apple has big plans toenhance its printer line.andP;  Ethernet-equipped laser printers are in the worksand may make their debut as early as next summer or fall.andP;  Current specs callfor a 68030 processor and the same Canon SX print engine used in today'sLaserWriters.andP;  The Knife predicts two models, one of which will have truegray-scale output capability.andM;If the Knife's usually reliable headhunter friends are on track, Apple isbeefing up its human printer resources by luring talent away from thecompetition, notably Hewlett-Packard.andP;  These reports, together with Apple'sadvertised vacant printer product-manager positions, indicate that Appleintends your next printer (and probably the one after that) to sport theproper corporate logo.andM;Let's make a deal.andP;  Ashton-Tate may have given up on dBASE Mac, but New EraSoftware, the product's new owner, is seriously committed to a new versiondesigned to address the shortcomings of the current release.andP;  The Knife haslearned that the company has recently inked a deal with Serius Corp. for ajoint development effort.andP;  New Era will concentrate on the database engine,while Serius will use its object-oriented development system to provide theinterface.andP;  The database will have hooks to Serius Business and other Seriusproducts that conform to its application interface.andM;After the New Year's celebrations are over and the bureaucrats in Washingtonare busy extrapolating the future of the economy based on past performance,the Mac sector will shift into high gear with January's Macworld Expo.andP;  TheKnife is promising lots of seductive new software and hardware offerings,including Aldus FreeHand 3.0 and the color version of the Radius Pivotmonitor.andM;Start your own immaculate collection.andP;  The MacWEEK mug is the industry's onlymarketing chatchka guaranteed not to offend MTV taste arbitrators.andP;  Justifyyour mug to the Knife with some insider info.andP;  Call him at (415) 243-3500 orMCI (MactheKnife).andO;</TEXT></DOC>
