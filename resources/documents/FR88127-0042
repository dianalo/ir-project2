Reyes and Franklin Point off the Coast of California. The permitauthorizes the use of experimental fishing gear which is otherwise prohibitedby Federal regulations.

The procedures for issuing EFPsare contained in the regulations at andSection;663.10.An EFP application submitted by the Vietnamese Fishermen Association ofAmerica to use a pair trawl off the California coast to harvest groundfishincidentally to a directed fishery for white croaker was received on November2, 1987. A notice describing the proposal and requesting public commentwas published in the Federal Register on November 25, 1987 (52 FR 45217).The application was considered by the Pacific Fishery Management Council(Council) at its November 1987 public meeting in Portland, Oregon. Thetestimony received by the Council supported issuing the permit, and theCouncil recommended that NMFS issue the permit with appropriate restrictions.No public comments were received.The experimental fishery will test the feasibility of conducting a successfulfishery for white croaker with gear that replaces gill nets. If successful,the potential harm to marine birds and mammals will be greatly diminished.The applicant will be permitted to harvest groundfish incidental to a directedharvest for white croaker until December 31, 1988, with a pair trawl netof two- to three-inch mesh. Two domestic vessels will be involved in thefishery, which will operate in the EEZ off the coast of California betweenPoint Reyes and Franklin Point. The Federal permit is contingent upon theapplicant's possession of a California permit for the same purpose.Not more than 1000 pounds of groundfish species regulated by 50 CFR Part663 may be taken and retained, or landed from a fishing trip. The experimentalfishing permit will be suspended if total landings reach 30,000 poundsof groundfish, though the Regional Director may restore the permit if hedetermines that adjustment of the operation will reduce bycatch sufficientlyto conduct a relatively homogeneous croaker fishery. The permit includesdata recording and reporting requirements and allows the Regional Directorto place an observer on the permitted vessels.Details or a copy of the permit may be obtained from either Regional Director(see <T2>Addresses</T2>).<ITAG tagnum="20">(16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 21, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard H.
