Those curbs on such sales had been imposed under provisions ofthe Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.   The bill repeals a requirement that the duration for anycontract representing an initial sale of new Outer ContinentalShelf natural gas be at least 15 years.   It also does away with a requirement that producers of certaindecontrolled natural gas offer existing purchasers of their producta right of first refusal when the producer receives another offerfor the gas.   ``With the support of the Reagan administration and VicePresident George Bush's administration task force on regulatoryrelief, the legislation passed Congress with substantial support,''the White House press office said in a statement as Reagan arrivedhere to make a political speech.   The press office said Reagan had signed the bill on Air ForceOne en route here from Washington.   The statement said that repeal of certain anti-competitiveelements of the 1978 energy act ``will increase the flexibility ofnatural gas producers and purchasers to enter into agreements thataccurately reflect market conditions.''   ``It will also benefit consumers by increasing theresponsiveness of interstate gas prices to a more competitivemarket,'' it said.</TEXT></DOC>
