The evaluation of seismicresistance is prescribed only for equipment and systems which securethe safe reactor shutdown, the withdrawal of residual heat and preventuncontrolled release of radioactivity into the environment. The followingvariants were compared in the calculation analysis of the primary loopof the WWER-440 reactor for the Mochovce nuclear power plant: the seismicallyunsecured loop of a usual design for WWER-440 nuclear power plants, theloop provided with mechanical or hydraulic dampers and the loop providedwith viscose shock absorbers. The tests showed that technically mostsuitable is the use of viscose shock absorbers which do not completelyblock the movement of the system during the earthquake but absorb itintensively. The viscose shock absorbers are also much cheaper than thedampers. Briefly described is experience with the experimental evaluationof the seismic resistance of components of the Mochovce nuclear powerplant. Great difficulty was encountered by the non-existence in Czechoslovakiaof a seismic table allowing simultaneous excitation in the vertical andhorizontal directions. (Z.M.). 18 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
