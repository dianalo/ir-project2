The Pentagon pledges $200 million tohelp communities hurt by defense cuts. But with hundreds ofthousands of pink slips already handed out, the non-profitNational Commission for Economic Conversion and Disarmamentsays that's too little, too late.   Researcher Gordon Adams of the Defense Budget Projectthinks layoffs have been exaggerated and &quot;the problem is notas great as the fear.&quot;                                                                                                          THE RIGHT STUFF will become kid stuff, aerospace companieshope.   Faced with an impending shortage of engineers, companiesfear unstable Pentagon contracting has scared &quot;some of thebest and brightest&quot; students away from the field, says PeterOram, president of Grumman's aircraft division. So theindustry-supported International Aerospace Hall of Fameinvites 200 seventh- and eighth-graders to summer camp, wherethey can operate a commercial airline simulator, experienceweightlessness and take a computer-simulated trip to Mars.   Northrop sponsors an academic decathlon, and Boeingco-hosts a tech fair for 400 high-school students. Lockheeddonates $1.5 million for university grants and scholarships.Hughes Aircraft and Lockheed executives lead aminorities-in-engineering conference with workshops titled&quot;Turning Kids on to Math and Science&quot; and &quot;Keeping Studentsin the Talent Pool.&quot;                                                                                                          FLYING HIGH: Aerospace employees face more random drugtesting.   The Aerospace Industries Association estimates that mostof its 57 member companies, spurred by governmentregulations, have adopted drug tests. &quot;We need people to besafe and alert,&quot; says Dan Nauer, vice president of humanresources. Employees at LTV's Arkansas rocket-system plantendorsed random testing, he says.   Executives seek to win union support. General Dynamicssettled grievances with the Machinists over random testing.&quot;It's not nearly as emotional an issue anymore,&quot; says BillPersky, corporate director of safety and health. But theMachinists still generally frown on random testing, spokesmanMatt Bates says.   The union challenged Boeing's testing program as acontract violation, but the NLRB rejected the claim.                                                                                                          BROTHERS IN ARMS: About 40 Soviet aerospace officials thisspring visited a dozen U.S. companies. Among their most askedquestions was, &quot;How do you keep employees happy?&quot; says JohnMorton, partner at the Boston law firm Hale andamp; Dorr, whichorganized the trip.                                                                                                          CROSS-TRAINING WORKERS: Under an agreement with theMachinists, GenCorp.'s Aerojet Electronic Systems divisioncan train employees in up to three skill areas within asingle job classification. The pact will reduce thebargaining unit to 350 members from 400, but &quot;the unionleadership realized it's better to do that than&quot; to remainless efficient and &quot;not get work at all,&quot; says Don Bartrip,the company's director of human resources.                                                                                                          BOEING BOASTS that it has the only two female flight-testcaptains -- Susan Darcy and Rose Loper -- employed by anycommercial airframe maker. &quot;Once other pilots are convincedyou can do the job, you fit right in,&quot; Darcy says.                                                                                                          NEW RULES APPLY for those with slide rules.   Long accustomed to tinkering freely, engineers are beingasked to focus more on the bottom line. Martin Mariettaresearchers now have a year or two to work on projects, downfrom five or 10 years. &quot;It requires cultural change,&quot; says SyZeiberg, vice president for technical operations at thecompany's electronics, information and missiles group.General Dynamics Chairman William Anders speaks of shuttingdown company &quot;hobby shops&quot; to pare expenses.   &quot;Management in aerospace has always been reluctant to takeon engineering,&quot; says Marty Bollinger, a Booz Allen vicepresident. &quot;Now, the engineers are being forced to think likebusinessmen.&quot; Engineers also are told to work more closelywith production people to improve quality and keep costs inline.   The trick is to avoid thwarting creativity because what'sdesigned today &quot;becomes your bread and butter&quot; down the road,says Eric Sandberg, a Northrop engineer.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: Lawsuits seeking nearly $1.5 billion arefiled against Lockheed by 248 current and former workers whoclaim they were exposed to toxic chemicals. . . . Hourlylabor costs in the aircraft and parts manufacturing industrygrew 4.2% to $24.40 in the first quarter. . . .
