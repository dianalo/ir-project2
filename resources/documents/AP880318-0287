STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CONSTANCE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. and European trade officialsare holding a new round of talks in the lengthy dispute overgovernment subsidies to the Airbus aircraft manufacturingconsortium.   But both sides remain far apart on the long-simmering issue ofsubsidies to Airbus, which the United States contends are unfair,and U.S. trade envoys are not optimistic about the outcome of themeeting.   ``The expectations are very low,'' an official close to thenegotiations said Thursday.   The U.S. delegation, led by trade representative ClaytonYeutter, is expected to use today's meeting to increase pressure onthe economic ministers representing the four Airbus countries toabolish or at least scale down the payments, sources said.   U.S. officials have grown impatient over the slow progress ofthe talks and are looking for indications that the Airbus nationsat least are willing to agree to reduce some of their support,sources said.   ``The Americans at a minimum want the Europeans to give a signalthat they are willing to accept some effective discipline in regardto subsidies,'' an informed diplomatic source, who asked not to beidentified, said earlier this week.   The United States estimates the four countries involved in theAirbus Industrie consortium _ France, Britain, West Germany andSpain _ have given $10 billion to the consortium since it wascreated 17 years ago.   Willy de Clercq, the European Economic Community's externalrelations commissioner, said last week there was a ``realisticchance'' of settling the dispute. But he also said the EECgovernments ``cannot entirely renounce'' state aid payments toAirbus.   De Clercq predicted an agreement would require ``further roundsof very difficult negotiations.''   The United States maintains that subsidies to Airbus are unfairto U.S. aircraft makers in the wide-body, long-haul passenger jetmarket.   The Airbus nations contend the subsidies do not distort tradeand are allowed under civil aircraft provisions of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade.   The EEC also argues that U.S. aircraft manufacturers long haveenjoyed huge, indirect subsidies through military contracts fromthe Pentagon and millions in government research grants.   According to EEC figures, the United States exports $5 billionworth of aircraft and aircraft parts to Western Europe per year,compared to $3 billion of European aircraft exports annually to theUnited States.   The EEC says outstanding European orders and options for U.S.aircraft total $23 billion, while U.S. orders and options forAirbus stand at $13 billion.   The United States contends Airbus has 35 percent of the worldmarket, a figure the EEC rejects as far too high.   The EEC claims U.S. manufacturers still dominate the worldwidecivilian aircraft market, with Boeing controlling 49 percent of themarket and McDonnell Douglas Corp. 17 percent, while Airbus has a25 percent share.   The United States has threatened to retaliate against Airbus ifthe negotiations fail, despite a recent decision by the four Airbusministers to have Airbus managers enter into direct negotiationswith McDonnell Douglas on a possible joint project.   The aim of the talks is to see whether the two sides couldcollaborate on one or more new airplanes.   Under the proposal, the new aircraft would not compete withexisting models.   But diplomatic sources told The Associated Press that the movewas unlikely to reduce tensions over the subsidy issue.   ``It may well be helpful for Airbus and McDonnell Douglas toagree on a joint project, but that will not solve the core problemof the current subsidies,'' said another diplomatic source, whoalso declined to be identified further.</TEXT></DOC>
