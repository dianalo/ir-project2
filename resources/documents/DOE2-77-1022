These were built in unusually isolatedplaces where herd immunity to a postulated widespread virus infection(to which leukaemia is a rare response) would tend to be lower than average.The large influxes of people in the 1950s to those areas might have beenconducive to epidemics. The hypothesis has been tested in Scotland inan area identified at the outset as the only other rural area that receiveda large influx at the same time, when it was much more cut off from thenearest conurbation than at present - the New Town of Glenrothes. A significantincrease of leukaemia below age 25 was found (10 observed, expected 3.6),with a greater excess below age 5 (7 observed, expected 1.5).</TEXT></DOC>
