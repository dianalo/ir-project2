As the constrains differ from industryto industry, the optimization of the components to conserve energy inthe industrial processing sector comminution requires that proper selectionof machinery be made for specific industry. Optimization of comminutioncircuits requires that the installed machinery power be fully utilizedand that the feed supplied is homogeneous and continuous. Because thespecific power consumption for crushing is lower than that for grinding,a reduction in the energy consumption of a comminution circuit wouldoccur if the range of the crushing is increased. The application of processcontrol over the entire comminution process would yield appreciable savingsin the energy consumption provided the operating parameter of a giveninstallation is known and defined. 55 figs., 10 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
