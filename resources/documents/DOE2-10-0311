<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-10-0311 </DOCNO><TEXT>The capacity installed in geothermal power plants amounts to about 5000MW worldwide. Geothermal energy is available through active volcaniczones of the earth. While the developing countries can rely on it asone of their indigenous energy sources, the extensive search for geothermalhot water reservoirs in the Federal Republic of Germany brought onlymodest results. Compared with the geothermal alternative, hot-dry technologiesprofitting from the heat emitted by dry hot rocks more than 5000 m beloware considered the more promising solution. A brief survey informs aboutthe aims and challenge of hot-dry-rock technologies (temperature of rocks,cogeneration) as well as about their latest scientific and technicaltrends (Europe, USA). Reference is made to so far unsolved HDR problems(heat exchange surfaces, pumping performance, seismic risks, thermalenvironmental loads), and to European strategies (experimental activities,research funds, co-operation). The annex gives a tabular survey of BMFT-supportedgeothermal research programs. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
