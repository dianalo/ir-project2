A group of leaders of the Reform and Conservative branches -- the mainstream of American Judaism -- for the first time threatened to bypass the mammoth philanthropic agency and send some donations directly to Israel. They were unhappy over what they view as religious intolerance in Israel and complained that too much UJA money was going to the Orthodox groups, whose leaders have a stranglehold over Israeli religious and political life. Because of Orthodox influence, for instance, marriages performed by Reform or Conservative rabbis aren't recognized by the Jewish state.    There are other signs of restlessness within the American Jewish community. When Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told Secretary of State George Shultz during a visit here last February that Jews emigrating from the Soviet Union should go directly to Israel, U.S. Jewish leaders quickly and publicly disagreed. They stressed that the prime minister doesn't set policy for world Jewry and that Soviet emigres should be allowed to go anywhere they want, including the U.S.    Twenty years ago, Israel's stunning victory in the June 1967 Six-Day War united American Jews behind the tiny Mideast nation as never before. But today, a younger generation has begun openly to criticize Israeli society and its leaders, signaling the end of the era of unquestioning devotion to Israel by U.S. Jews.    &quot;Once, there was a kind of uneasiness on the part of American Jews about interfering in the internal affairs of Israel,&quot; says Rabbi Wolfe Kelman, the executive vice president of Conservative Judaism's Rabbinical Assembly. &quot;But now there's a growing readiness to say, 'Hey, wait a minute, what's going on over there?'&quot;    What's going on is that Israel is changing. It is increasingly dominated by religiously fundamentalist and politically militant Jewish immigrants from Arab countries, rather than the European Holocaust survivors who built the Israel most American Jews identify with.    &quot;In the past, American Jews had an undifferentiated, passionate, idealized, romanticized view of Israeli society. But that has broken down as they have become more aware of Israel's conflicts between left and right, religious and secular, Jew and Arab, rich and poor,&quot; says Steven Cohen, a sociologist at New York's Queens College. A nationwide survey he took last year found that only 63% of U.S. Jews say that caring deeply about Israel is an important part of their Jewishness, down from 78% in his 1983 survey.    Attitudes began to change noticeably after Israel's 1982 invasion deep into Lebanon; many U.S. Jews complained that the push to the outskirts of Beirut went far beyond Israel's need to defend itself. Recently, American Jews have been disturbed by disclosures that Jerusalem recruited an American spy, Jonathan Pollard. Israel's reaction to the spy case, generally perceived as uncooperative, and its reluctance to cooperate with investigations of its role in the Iran-Contra scandal also rankled many American supporters.    Indeed, anger and disappointment with Israel have been so intense that some worry that these feelings could eventually translate into a gradual weakening of Jerusalem's political influence in Congress. To be sure, it is generally agreed that any effort to cut the $3 billion a year in U.S. aid to Israel would be resoundingly defeated by legislators. And support for Israel's survival and national security remains rock-solid within the Jewish community.    But some fissures are developing at the margin. Rep. Stephen Solarz, a staunchly pro-Israel New York Democrat, says that against the backdrop of overall U.S. budget austerity, there now are more lawmakers &quot;who undoubtedly would feel it has become politically easier to justify voting {for cuts in aid to Israel}, given the whole series of revelations and reports that haven't exactly been seen as a feather in Israel's cap.&quot;    Thomas Dine, the executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the leading pro-Israel lobby, told a recent gathering of Jewish activists that those who had predicted an end to the U.S.-Israel honeymoon were &quot;flat wrong.&quot; Referring to a 60-page booklet crammed with the details of legislative successes, he called 1986 a year of &quot;striking achievements and advancements&quot; for Israel on Capitol Hill.    Others see reason for concern. They contend that pro-Israel groups focus too much on their lobbying proficiency and fail to realize that Israel's broad American support is based on admiration for its democratic values and the belief that its cause is just. In the eyes of many, Israel's moral high ground has been weakened by the invasion of Lebanon, spying on the U.S. and arms sales to South Africa's minority-white government (Israel earlier this year pledged not to renew its South African military contracts).    &quot;There's no way to see the erosion of a foundation until a catastrophe happens,&quot; warns David Saperstein, co-director and counsel of the Religious Action Center, a Reform Judaism group. &quot;I fear it may be under way,&quot; he adds, although he stresses that Israel remains a bulwark of democracy in the Middle East.    A small but growing number of American Jews are reacting to these changes in Israel by joining new organizations that go beyond the traditional pattern of passive giving. These include Friends of Peace Now, which urges Israeli peace negotiations with the Arabs, and the New Israel Fund, an alternative charitable group that supports projects often ignored by the mainstream UJA.    &quot;What is in the offing is not a split but a renegotiation of the terms of the relationship&quot; between American Jews and Israel, says Leonard Fine, former editor of Moment magazine, a monthly publication of Jewish affairs. &quot;It flows from a growing sense of disappointment among American Jews with Israel.&quot;    This changing view of Israel reflects in large part the coming of age of a new generation of American Jews. For those more than 50 years old, Israel continues to conjure up images of a new land settled by waves of European survivors. &quot;You can parade Ariel Sharon in front of me in full battle dress,&quot; says the 52-year-old Mr. Fine, referring to the Israeli architect of the Lebanon invasion, &quot;and I will close my eyes and see the refugees coming off the boats from Europe and kissing the ground. So I can absorb a lot and not be alienated.&quot;    But a younger generation, although equally devoted, tends to see Israel as a troubled rather than a promised land, a state that is less European, less open to peace negotiations and more religiously rigid. This generation worries about an Israel that has become an occupying force, that is a society in which women frequently are denied the right to divorce by Orthodox rabbinical courts, that is a land where organ transplants and scientific research are severely restricted by religious law and where religious extremists once walled off the grave of a Reform rabbi because they believe it desecrated the cemetery.    &quot;The older generation saw Israel as a haven,&quot; says 37-year-old David Arnow, the president of New Israel Fund. &quot;We're not so naive to say we may not need a haven someday, but we're concerned about the quality of the state we want to support. There's a greater willingness to look within for some of the problems, rather than to the enemy outside as the cause of all problems.&quot;    Last year's clash over how the United Jewish Appeal spends some of its money in Israel is a microcosm of the tensions that are straining the unifying fabric of American Judaism.    The UJA was founded after Kristallnacht, the dark night in November 1938 when Nazi-inspired mobs wrecked Jewish homes and businesses across Germany. The organization is part of the structure through which the U.S. Jewish community has always spoken with one voice. With a national network in 600 communities, the UJA last year raised $725 million in what amounts to a voluntary tax paid by American Jews to help their brethren around the world. About half the money is earmarked for social-service agencies in the U.S.; the rest goes abroad, with about 80% of that portion going to Israel.    The distribution of UJA funds to religious institutions in Israel is heavily influenced by Orthodox Jews, who live by strict biblical rules. They don't recognize the more modern Reform and Conservative sects to which about 80% of America's religious Jews belong. (There are about six million Jewish citizens in the U.S., half of whom are affiliated with a synagogue.)    Last year, some $30 million of the UJA funds sent to Israel was specifically earmarked for Orthodox institutions, but only about $2.5 million for Reform and Conservative institutions. The balance of the UJA money that is sent to Israel is spent on Israeli general social-welfare programs.    Last year, Reform and Conservative Jews began to make known their dissatisfaction with the UJA. Of the $17 million that the San Francisco chapter of the UJA raised during the year, the chapter earmarked $100,000 for specific programs in Israel, such as groups that promote Arab-Jewish relations -- the first time the chapter hadn't routed all its money through the national UJA. A Reform congregation in Indianapolis approved a resolution saying that if the agency didn't stop favoring Orthodox Jews, it would begin sending its contributions directly to Israel.    Worried by such independence, senior UJA officials last year held a series of meetings with Reform and Conservative leaders; following the meetings, the agency voted to earmark an additional $2.5 million for specific projects requested by Reform or Conservative organizations.    Meanwhile, new organizations with a growing diversity of views are flourishing on what once was a monolithic landscape. For example, the New Israel Fund, which began six years ago with several hundred thousand dollars in contributions, this year will send $3 million to Israel for such projects as Neve Shalom, an experimental village where Arabs and Jews live together. And Friends of Peace Now, started in 1982 in the wake of the controversial Lebanon invasion, currently has 17 chapters in the U.S. and Canada. Last year, it sponsored a seven-city U.S. tour for Israelis and Palestinians to discuss mutual problems before synagogue audiences.    &quot;We could never have done that four years ago,&quot; says Mark Rosenblum, the group's North America coordinator. &quot;People used to fall back on the argument that Israel elects its government and we have to support it. Now, the government there is divided. It represents two different societies. That's what the confusion here is all about.&quot;    This summer, the Reform movement in Israel will open the Israel Religious Action Center, financed by U.S. Reform Jews, to initiate lawsuits to press for equal treatment. &quot;We intend to go to court to fight for the rights of Reform rabbis to be chaplains in the army, for Reform institutions to get allocations of government funds and for Reform rabbis to be able to perform legally recognized conversions in Israel,&quot; says Rabbi Eric Yoffie, who plays an active role in the movement for greater religious pluralism in Israel.    The extensive power of Orthodox leaders in Israel had its roots in the Six-Day War, when Israel demolished its Arab enemies and occupied the West Bank, Gaza and all of Jerusalem. A new generation of religious fundamentalists saw the hand of God at work and became actively involved in making sure these biblical lands remained part of Israel.    A decade later, when Menachem Begin, a hard-liner, became the prime minister, he made these groups part of his conservative constituency, and their power increased. By last year, one of Israel's chief rabbis was stating publicly that Jews shouldn't sell land to Arabs, and another was suggesting that young men should study, rather than go into the army. Such comments exacerbated the already bitter debates in Israel over the future of the occupied territories, creating conflicts for U.S. Jews.    &quot;The old rule -- love Israel and its leaders -- created an intolerable choice for people, because the corollary was dislike Israel and drop out,&quot; says Mr. Fine. &quot;Now, we are seeing the beginning of a third position: Love Israel, but evaluate its leaders and policies on the merits.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
