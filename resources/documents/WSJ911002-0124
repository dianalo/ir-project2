And leadership throughout the developedworld no longer rests on financial control or traditionalcost advantages. It rests on control of brain power.   These companies are also fast restructuring theirorganizations on the assumption that the winner in acompetitive world economy is going to be the firm that bestorganizes the systematic abandonment of its own products. Andthey are moving from Total Quality Management towardZero-Defects Management based on drastically differentprinciples and methods.</LP><TEXT>   The Japanese now hold about 30% of the U.S. automobilemarket and expect to increase this share substantially in thenext few years. Yet they also expect to stop exportingJapanese-made cars to the American market within the nextthree to five years; by 1995 or so, most Japanese marquessold in the U.S. should be manufactured in North Americanplants.   Similarly, the Japanese expect to have something likeone-third of the automobile market of the European EconomicCommunity by the year 2000 (whatever their present promisesto the EC to the contrary), but again without exporting manycars from Japan. And Japanese multinationals -- Toyota,Honda, Sony, Matsushita, Fujitsu, the ceramics leaderKyocera, and the Mitsubishi companies -- are pouringstaggering amounts of money into manufacturing plants indeveloping countries. They are in Tijuana on the U.S.-Mexicanborder, throughout South America, in Southern Europe, and inSoutheast Asia.   The standard explanations for moving manufacturing out ofJapan are &quot;foreign protectionism&quot; and &quot;Japan's growing laborshortage.&quot; Both explanations are legitimate, but they arealso smoke screens. The real reason is the growing convictionamong Japan's business leaders and influential bureaucratsthat manufacturing work does not belong in a developedcountry such as Japan.   Before youngsters can go to work on the assembly line, myJapanese friends say again and again, Japan pours $100,000 inschool expenses into them. And then they have to get amiddle-class income, lifetime security, a pension and healthcare. In Bangkok or in Tijuana, youngsters require verylittle capital investment in their educations; and they are&quot;middle class&quot; if paid a 10th the wages of the U.S. or Japan.Yet their productivity after two or three years of trainingis as high in Tijuana or in Bangkok as it is in Nagoya orDetroit. When you figure the enormous social capital investedin them, my friends say, the return that blue-collar workersmake to society in developed countries is at most 1% or 2%;in Latin America or Indonesia, it's 20 times that.   Whenever I then argue that a country is highly vulnerablewithout a strong manufacturing base, they respond that thesupply of young people in the developing world will be solarge in the next 30 years that it's absurd to worry aboutthe &quot;manufacturing base,&quot; the way Americans do. Indeed it'smy friends' social responsibility to Japan, they say, to makesure that as few as possible of its high-investment,high-cost young people are being misused for low-yieldmanufacturing work.   Instead, the new Japanese strategies call for totalcontrol of what now matters. To be competitive, the argumentgoes, Japan requires leadership in technology, marketing andmanagement, and firm control of what my Japanese friends arebeginning to call &quot;brain capital.&quot;   The Japanese are willing to pay large sums to gain accessto knowledge -- through a minority participation in a SiliconValley computer specialist; through similar investments inU.S. and European pharmaceutical or geneticsentrepreneurships; above all, through financing research inWestern (mainly U.S.) universities. The direct financialreturn is usually zero. But the Japanese are paying not fordividends but access to the knowledge their partners willproduce, and control over it -- or at least priority in usingit.   Increasingly Japanese companies employ foreigners in theirinternational operations, both as professionals and asexecutives. The large Japanese auto makers now all havedesign studios in Southern California and Westerners runningtheir international marketing. But the use of the knowledgethese foreigners produce is &quot;proprietary&quot; and tightly heldwithin the Japanese management team. And while in the pastsome Japanese companies granted licenses on their knowledgeto Western companies -- e.g., on some Japanese-developedcardiac drugs -- they are now revoking or not renewing them.   Every major Japanese industrial group now has its ownresearch institute, whose main function is to bring to thegroup awareness of any important new knowledge -- intechnology, in management and organization, in marketing, infinance, in training -- developed world-wide. On my last tripto Japan, a few months ago, I spoke at the 20th anniversaryof one of these think tanks, that of the Mitsubishi Group. Atlunch after my talk, one of the most respected elders of theMitsubishi clan said to me: &quot;In another 20 years the entireMitsubishi Group will be organized around this researchinstitute.&quot;   Everybody now knows that the Japanese can bring out a newproduct in half the time it takes their American competitorsand in one-third the time it takes the Europeans. Andeverybody also knows that major U.S. companies arereorganizing their research and development work on theJapanese model, along cross-functional lines. But theJapanese are already moving to the next stage.   They are reorganizing Randamp;D so that it simultaneouslyproduces three new products with the effort traditionallyneeded to produce one. And they do this by starting out witha deadline for abandoning today's new product on the very dayit is first sold. &quot;The faster we can abandon today's newproduct, the stronger and the more profitable we'll be&quot; isthe new motto.   To most Western businessmen, this is madness. They believethat a product becomes more profitable the longer its productlife -- for then the money spent on developing it has beenwritten off. But &quot;writing off&quot; to the Japanese is useful tocut taxes but otherwise self-delusion.   Money spent on developing a product or a process is not&quot;investment&quot; to the Japanese; it is &quot;sunk cost.&quot; But the mainreason the leading Japanese businesses are now shifting thelife cycle of their products is their conviction that theonly alternative is for a competitor to do so -- and then thecompetitor will have not only the profits but the market.   My Japanese friends acknowledge that some Westerncompanies -- 3M, for example -- have long operated on thepolicy that 70% of their sales five years hence will have tocome from products that do not exist today. But thesecompanies rely on a spontaneous upswelling ofentrepreneurship from within.   By deciding in advance that they will abandon a newproduct within a given period of time, the Japanese forcethemselves to go to work immediately on replacing it, and todo so on three tracks:   One track (&quot;kaizen&quot;) is organized work on improvement ofthe product with specific goals and deadlines -- e.g., a 10%reduction in cost within 15 months and/or a 10% improvementin reliability within the same time, and/or a 15% increase inperformance characteristics -- and enough in any event toresult in a truly different product. The second track is&quot;leaping&quot; -- developing a new product out of the old. Thebest example is still the earliest one: Sony's development ofthe Walkman out of the newly developed portable taperecorder. And finally there is genuine innovation.   Increasingly, the leading Japanese companies organizethemselves so that all three tracks are pursuedsimultaneously and under the direction of the samecrossfunctional team. The idea is to produce three newproducts to replace each present product, with the sameinvestment of time and money -- with one of the three thenbecoming the new market leader and producing the &quot;innovator'sprofit.&quot;   Finally, the leading Japanese companies are moving fromTotal Quality Management to Zero Defects Management. &quot;Wecan't use TQM,&quot; one of the top manufacturing people at Toyotarecently said. &quot;At its very best -- and no one has reachedthat yet -- it cuts defects to 10%. But we turn out fourmillion cars, and a 10% defect rate means that 400,000 Toyotabuyers get a 100% defective car. But Zero-Defects Managementis now possible and actually not too difficult.&quot;   What the Japanese now practice is very much a return toFrederic Taylor's Scientific Management. Only the operatorsthemselves, rather than the industrial engineer, take theinitiative in studying the task, the work and the tools. Andinstead of stopwatch and camera, they use computersimulation.   What triggered this shift was an American import: the hugeand hugely successful Disneyland that opened outside ofTokyo. &quot;We all knew that it would take Disney three years towork the bugs out of this huge undertaking,&quot; a leadingJapanese industrialist told me. &quot;Instead, it ran with zerodefects the day it opened. Every single operation had beenengineered all the way through and simulated on the computerand trained for -- and it suddenly dawned on us that we coulddo this too.&quot;   Since the mid-1980s, he said, American firms have beenrushing to install TQM. &quot;That'll take 10 years before itreally works -- at least that's what it took here. This meansit will work in America around 1995. By that time we'll haveZero-Defects Management and will again be 15 years ahead ofyou.&quot;   These new Japanese strategies may not work. Or they maywork only for the Japanese. But even if they are the wrongresponses, they are at least responses to reality: theemergence of the highly competitive and world-wide knowledgeeconomy.   ---   Mr. Drucker is a professor of social sciences at theClaremont Graduate School in California.</TEXT></DOC>
