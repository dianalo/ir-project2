Thousands gathered in the afternoon drizzle and some raisedwhite, blue and red banners, the flag of czarist Russia, beforemarching about a mile to the Georgian cultural center.   There, they raised clenched fists and observed a minute ofsilence for the 19 people killed April 9 in the Georgian capital ofTbilisi. Soldiers have been accused of using shovels to beatprotesters, who were demanding independence for Georgia. Theofficial press has said an irritating chemical agent was used onthe protesters.   In Tbilisi on Sunday, thousands of people marched in a funeralprocession for 16-year-old Natia Barhsaleishvili, who died April 17of injuries sustained in the clash, said Sergei Dandurov. Dandurov,speaking from Tbilisi, said police did not interfere.   In Moscow, protesters pushed past police barricades, spillingonto Pushkin Square and across Tverskoy Boulevard. They hoisted aRussian banner with black mourning streamers. Soldiers took it down.   Police stood by in lines while a special Interior Ministry unitwaded into the crowd, singling out protesters and dragging them towaiting buses.   Protesters shouted ``Fascists,'' ``Gestapo'' and ``Shame'' atthe force. Those are especially potent slogans in a country thatstill reveres the memory of those who fought the invasion of NaziGermany in World War II.   The Tass news agency said 47 people were detained.   One protest leader, Yevgeniya Debryanskaya, was pushed onto abus after urging the crowd to march to the headquarters of theMoscow city government several blocks away.   Moscow authorities had banned Sunday's protest and warned itwould not be tolerated. They accused the organizing party, theDemocratic Union, of trying to stir up tension and disorder. TheDemocratic Union bills itself as an alternative to the CommunistParty.   Before the protest, the Democratic Union distributed leafletsaddressed to ``all anti-Fascists of our country'' announcing thegathering's time and place. ``Perestroika died on a bloodySunday,'' the leaflet said, drawing a parallel between PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms and the 1905 ``bloody Sunday,'' whenCzarist soldiers opened fire on protesters who were demandingreforms.   The leaflet continued: ``We can't turn to parliament withquestions. We don't have a parliament. We can't turn to independentcourts. We don't have courts or laws.''   Tass accused Democratic Union leaders of ``knowingly risking thelives and safety of participants in the meeting, and also all thosewho gathered.''   It said those arrested would be taken to the branches ofMoscow's Peoples Court for trial.</TEXT></DOC>
