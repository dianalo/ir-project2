The reasons for discarding nuclearpower are the problems of disposing of atomic waste, the danger of accidentsin nuclear power stations and the touchy subject of the spread of nuclearweapons to more countries. As oil reserves run low and damaging emissions(e.g. CO/sub 2/ emissions) from burning coal and oil necessitate alternativesin the field of fossil energy sources as well. The major alternativeis solar hydrogen. Hydrogen is just as suitable for driving cars andaeroplanes as it is for heating homes, providing industrial heat andgenerating electricity. It is harmless to the environment, although energyis needed to produce hydrogen. This can be done using solar energy withoutdanger to the environment. Hydrogen is then stored solar energy. In thisbook, experts from the fields of research, economics and politics commenton this energy source with potential for the future and the measuresneeded to put it into practice.
