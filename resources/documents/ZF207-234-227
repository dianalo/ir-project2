(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Computer Library One of the truest measures of a software package'susefulness is whether the product naturally fits into the daily work routine.andO;In the case of the $695-a-year Computer Library from Ziff Communications Co.,andO;the answer is yes if you need to tap into the vast information pertaining tothe computer industry printed in communications, computer, electronics, andtechnical periodicals.andM;Admittedly Computer Library has a leg up on the competition: as of thiswriting, there isn't any.andP;  Delivered as a monthly update, the disk includes ayear's worth of ten computer publications, including this magazine, whichmakes a total of over 45,000 documents.andP;  While the full-text treatment isapparently tilted in favor of the Ziff-Davis family of computer publications,the selection of abstracted publications is nevertheless impressive:offerings as diverse as ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories Technical Journal, Computersin Biology and Medicine, Dr.andP;  Dobb's Journal, and InfoWorld.andP;  What's missingare some general business and financial periodicals, with their profiles ofindividuals, companies, and products that drive the industry.andM;ACCESSING DOCUMENTSandM;Anyone familiar with the standard-issue Lotus command-menu style, pop-up helpscreens, and mnemonic-based action keys will feel right at home with theBlueFish retrieval software.andP;  Its clearly written documentation is useful forgaining initial familiarity with the searchware concepts, commands, andfunctions, and the plentiful help screens take you from there.andP;  Of two basicwork screens, Log essentially sets the general arena for the work; the other,Browse, gets down to the specifics--moving through and between documents.andO;It's from these screens that the commands go to work.andM;When you perform a search, the BlueFish software responds by seeking matchesfrom the database on each word and phrase within the query.andP;  It the recordsthe number of documents containing matches and enters the documents,highlighting query words and phrases, into the Log.andP;  From here you can viewdocument titles and other summary information using the commands Titles andBrowse.andP;  You can also progressively narrow the document search range.andM;Search strategies use the Boolean operators AND, OR, WITHIN, and WITHOUT, andtighter precision is afforded with variables for proximity searches in thesame sentence, paragraph, or document.andP;  It can also define searches withinany given number of words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents.andP;  Hotkeys andother shortcuts help you along throughout BlueFish's entire operation.andM;Up to four words per phrase, ten words per query, or 150 characters cancomprise each query, and access time varies according to the complexity ofthe query.andP;  A basic search on the words &quot;personal computer&quot; from theSeptember 1988 Inaugural Disk, for example, drew 6,619 matches on &quot;personal&quot;and 78,741 on &quot;computer,&quot; and found 1,136 documents containing both.andP;  Accesstime on an average of three trials was 101.39 seconds.andP;  Average access timeon the more complex query &quot;personal computer and cd-rom and high sierra andmicrosoft and sony and ms-dos&quot; resulted in one document match after 207.97seconds.andM;Secondary to the all-important Query command are Copy and Print (after allthe searching, you need a place for the information).andP;  Any document may bemarked or tagged for printing or copying to an ASCII file on a hard or floppydisk.andP;  Output can be specified to include an identifying slug or remark,title, plus text and character tags based on the highlighted query-matchedwords.andP;  Included are the options to print and copy complete matched documentsor portions of those documents when matches occur--not quite cut and paste,but close enough.andM;SOME LIMITATIONSandM;It's understandable that Computer Library's editorial content of thefull-text documents have a number of typos, considering that the fulltextdocuments are mostly keystroked rather than picked up electronically--notenough to bother most readers, but enough to be noticeable.andP;  Human error,however, has left behind more typos.andP;  A search on my last name yielded fivearticles attributed to me, one of which I didn't write.andM;Some technological limitations are present as well.andP;  Although there's agrowing list of file attachments on each update, a suitable format forincluding features tables and fact files (with their invaluable companyaddresses and phone numbers) like those in this magazine has not yet beenimplemented.andP;  Mouse support, too, would greatly help this product.andM;Though Computer Library is far from a perfected product, the constant demandfor its use around the PC Magazine offices points to its usefulness as a pureand simple research tool and information resource on our chosen subject ofinterest--personal computers.andP;  And with a growing list of publications andexpansion of the full-text lineup, its market advantage is ensured.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
