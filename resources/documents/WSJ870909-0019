Hutton Group Inc. has placed new restrictions on the trading of Hutton securities by the investment banking firm's employees, Hutton said.    Certain senior officials and staff personnel have been designated as &quot;restricted persons,&quot; meaning they can trade Hutton securities only during specific periods. The periods begin 72 hours after the public release of the firm's quarterly earnings statement and end on the 15th day of the month following the earnings release.    Previously, such officials were subjected by Hutton to normal restrictions barring them from trading while in possession of nonpublic, inside information.    Hutton also tightened restrictions on employee trading of Hutton stock options. A Hutton spokesman said the changes in the firm's employee trading policies are &quot;part of an ongoing management review of company policies.&quot;    A memo circulated to employees last month explaining the new policies also reminded them that no one who &quot;possesses material nonpublic information concerning Hutton may buy or sell Hutton Group securities or otherwise use the information to his or her advantage or pass it on to others for their advantage.&quot;    As previously reported, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been investigating since November the abortive merger talks between Hutton and Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., which is 60%-owned by American Express Co. The investigation is looking at the adequacy of Hutton's disclosure during the talks and at whether there were any leaks of inside information concerning the talks. The Hutton spokesman declined to comment on the investigation or on whether the new employee trading restrictions were related to the SEC probe. </TEXT></DOC>
