Hundreds more were still out of their homes elsewhere because offlooding caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Allison.   The death toll since Allison sloshed ashore in Texas a week roseto 13 _ one in North Carolina, five in Mississippi, four in Texasand three in Louisiana.   At least 700 Louisiana homes have been flooded, and some 500people remained flooded out of their homes in Liberty County, Texas,authorities said.   Campers were evacuated from three steeply mountainous counties ofwestern North Carolina. One woman drowned when her tent was washedaway, but her husband was rescued. Divers searched for the body andthose of possible other victims.   Several agencies and volunteers used kayaks to take campersacross rapidly rising streams.   ``I think it's the worst it's been here since the flood of1940,'' said Tom Huskins Jr., general manager of GrandfatherMountain near Linville. ``And it's still falling hard.''   Water from Land Harbor Lake flowed over the top of an earthendam, raising fears of a dam break. Campgrounds below the dam wereflooded and were evacuated.   State engineers said later in the day that the dam on the smalllake appeared to be safe ``at least for the time being, if the rainstops soon,'' said Jack Hughes, emergency management coordinator forAvery county. However, while the rain slackened Tuesday afternoon,showers were expected to continue through Wednesday. Hughes saidemergency personnel were told to stay near their radios through thenight.   The remnants of Allison had dumped more than 1.5 inches of rainon the mountains since Monday, causing some mud slides. The NationalWeather Service said up to 2 inches of rain were likely, with up to4 inches in some areas.   Most July Fourth activities had been canceled in the mountains,which were jammed with campers despite the weather.   In the nearby western tip of South Carolina, up to 10 inches ofrain had fallen in 24 hours, closing some roads.   The rain was caused by tropical air lingering over the TennesseeValley area, ``outside of the normal weather train,'' makingforecasting difficult, said National Weather Service meteorologistTom Thorpe in Columbia, S.C. He said his best guess was that itwould stay in the area for least another day.   Farther back along Allison's disorganized track, more rain fellTuesday on Mississippi, where some cotton and soybean crops havebeen ruined and two counties were declared disaster areas.   Some lakes and streams continued to rise, but residents forcedfrom more than 200 homes over the weekend were able to return andbegin cleaning up.   Much of central Louisiana remained under water after a week ofthunderstorms. Northern and central Louisiana got up to 25 inches ofrain last week.   The water was still rising in places.   ``It's still coming up 18 to 20 inches a day,'' farmer RichardDaigre said of Bayou Rigolette, the only outlet for a lake that wasmore than 12 feet above flood stage. His recently planted fieldswere under water.   In Texas, low-lying areas along the Trinity River remained underwater Tuesday. The town of Dayton Lakes was was accessible by boatonly.   In Dallas, about 12,000 customers were still without electricityafter a storm containing 90 mph wind knocked down utility polesSunday.</TEXT></DOC>
