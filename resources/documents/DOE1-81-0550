Soluble organic matter entersthe anaerobic degradation process at a number of different points. Forinstance, acetate in the influent may be metabolized directly by methanogensindependent of catabolic interactions with other bacteria. Fatty acids,the major hydrolysis products of fats, are catabolized primarily by theobligate proton-reducing acetogens and converted to methanogenic substrates.Peptides, the hydrolysis products of protein, are taken up by bacteriaand hydrolyzed to amino acids that may be used as carbon and energy sourcesvia fermentative reactions. Oligosaccharides, the major hydrolysis productsof carbohydrate polymers, are taken up by bacteria and catabolized byvarious fermentative pathways. Traditionally, anaerobic digestion hasbeen described as a two-phase process with the products of the firstor acidogenic phase serving as intermediate substrates for the secondor methanogenic phase.</TEXT></DOC>
