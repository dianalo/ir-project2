From the front door of Mountain View's new CityHall, 500 Castro St., to the front door of the old, 444 Castro, is 168 longishstrides, across the civic center plaza and Mercy Street.;    As Paul Bainssees it, it's not so easy. He will need 40 movers and seven vans to do hispart of the city's long-awaited office migration. And he vows not to rush thejob, the bulk of which will occur Friday and Saturday.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MTN. VIEW ON THE MOVE: CITY HALL, THAT IS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;It's a beautiful building,&quot; said the vice president of Bains Moving andStorage, the East Palo Alto company contracted for $25,000. &quot;We're taking allprecautionary measures. There will be no nicks and scratches that we willcause.&quot;;    Other contractors will move some specialized equipment, likecomputers, at a cost of roughly $5,000, said Connie Martinez, city generalservices director.;    City Hall will stay open Friday. Phones will beanswered, officials say.;    But it may not be an ideal day to apply for abuilding permit or to take your gripe to the mayor or city manager. Computerswill be shut down, and officials will be preoccupied.;    The new City Hallwill open Monday morning -- with the same phone numbers -- but officials arenot sure how many moving details will need to be wrapped up, so they areadvertising &quot;limited service&quot; available for the first day.;    Service doesn'tappear to be interrupted yet. Tuesday afternoon, moving boxes filled withpublic records were stacked four high in the city clerk's office. But boxeswere unpacked promptly for anyone who asked to see a particular file.;    Themove will require some logistical gymnastics. It will start with the sixthfloor of the old City Hall, home to the city attorney, city manager and cityclerk. The elevators in the building, which are used by other businesses, willonly be available Friday from noon to 1:30 p.m., and after 6:30 p.m., Bainssaid.;    Cargo will be taken down the elevators to the basement, pushed up aramp and loaded into trucks. It will be driven a short ways to the newbuilding's cargo entrances and moved in.;    Next comes the second-floormezzanine, a part of 444 Castro detached from the main tower, which houses theplanning and public works departments. Bains will need to take out a sealedwindow there to move boxes and furniture down with hoists and scaffolding.;   Last comes the finance and personnel departments, which are at ground level.;   After the move is done, on Saturday, March 23, the city will have an openhouse and dedication starting at 11 a.m.;    Two-thirds of the furniture willmove into the new quarters, said Jim Williamson, city purchasing agent. Mostof the rest will move to other departments throughout the city: police, fire,parks, library, utilities and recreation.;    &quot;By that time it will be prettymuch the dregs of the furniture,&quot; Williamson said.;    A furniture broker willpick through it on Sunday, perhaps buying some pieces. Then the city willscrap the leftovers or donate them to community groups.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  NICK ANDERSON, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910313  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  515  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday March 13, 199100073232,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
