GeorgeBush has become the quarterback everyone expects to lead histeam to a final touchdown drive and victory. Meanwhile, allof his teammates and fans claim to &quot;support&quot; the President,but at just enough distance that they don't have to handlethe ball themselves, or take any blame if he falls short.   Take Mikhail Gorbachev. The essential news from theHelsinki summit is that the Soviets are fundamentally onboard with U.S. policy. They may not help the U.S. in ashooting war, but they won't lift a finger for Saddam Husseineither. This is the overriding strategic issue, and is whatgives George Bush the freedom of action in this case that noU.S. President has had since the Soviets got the atomic bomb.</LP><TEXT>   Yet Mr. Gorbachev isn't about to sign on without his owncaviling and advice. He'll &quot;reduce&quot; the number of Sovietmilitary advisers, but won't withdraw them straightaway --perhaps because he doesn't want to seem to be merelyfollowing Mr. Bush. He can't resist floating the utopian hopefor a Middle East peace conference -- an idea gently butfirmly rebuffed by Secretary of State Baker.   Mr. Gorbachev even delivers a little lecture that &quot;nosingle country, however powerful,&quot; can lead the worldanymore. The Soviet leader still wants to talk as if hecommanded a superpower, even if it can no longer act likeone. Mr. Bush may feel that this is the price of the moreimportant strategic cooperation from the Soviets on Iraq, andif that's true it's all right with us.   Something similar seems evident among Mr. Bush's domestic&quot;supporters.&quot; It's true enough that outright opponents arefew -- for the moment. But everyone's carefully hedged.George Will frets that by using the United Nations Mr. Bushhas committed the U.S. to the hoariest notions ofinternational law. Congresswomen Pat Schroeder rolls out hergripe for all seasons: What about the allies? Senator JoeBiden doesn't want to restore the emir of Kuwait, as if thisis the main issue. Even Alexander Haig and Henry Kissinger,whom we earlier carelessly credited with urging a&quot;pre-emptive strike,&quot; have in fact not gone that far.   In a letter today, Georgia Senator Sam Nunn objects tobeing included in a Paul Gigot column describingneo-isolationism among conservatives. In the interests ofaccuracy, what Mr. Gigot wrote was that &quot;Mr. Nunn hastypified conservatives who've worried, grumbled and caviled.&quot;Readers of his letter can judge that for themselves.   What is most revealing in all of this is the timidityamong Washington's elites to state publicly the reality ofthis crisis. Either Saddam's aggression will succeed or itwill not. The dispatches from Middle East capitals reportthat Arab leaders all say privately that Saddam has to betaken out soon with a military strike. But in the currentAmerican foreign affairs gestalt, it somehow has become taboofor anyone to be seen in public urging military action.   While all of these elites now claim to &quot;support&quot; GeorgeBush, do they really? They're now well positioned to jump onboard and be seen as backing any successful mission Mr. Bushdecides to launch. But if the going gets tough, they're alsopositioned to get going. Either way, they'd all rather letGeorge do it.</TEXT></DOC>
