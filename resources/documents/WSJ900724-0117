But after five years, the SovietUnion is still mired in slothfulness and inefficiency. Why?Because Mr. Gorbachev has not kept up the pace of hisdomestic reforms.   When Mr. Gorbachev took office in the spring of 1985, heis said to have commissioned a study of the Stolypin reforms.Piotr Stolypin was prime minister of Russia in the early 20thcentury. Unlike Mr. Gorbachev, Stolypin managed to stave offnational disintegration while reviving a moribund economy.</LP><TEXT>   In the summer of 1905, the humiliating loss of the warwith Japan precipitated a wave of strikes, mutinies andpogroms. Czar Nicholas II granted a constitution thatestablished a democratically-elected parliament in October,but that step failed to restore order. The following year,the new parliament called for the resignation of the czaristgovernment and the expropriation of private property.   Enter Stolypin. An experienced civil servant, he took overthe government with energy and decisiveness. He quicklysuppressed the revolution, and rewrote the electoral laws tofavor property owners. Stolypin believed that onlybroadly-based property ownership could provide the foundationfor democracy and prosperity.   At the time, agriculture accounted for half the nation'sGNP and an impoverished peasantry constituted 84% of thepopulation. The peasants lived in approximately 100,000villages across Russia, most without electricity and someinaccessible even by road. Their customs had changed littlesince the Middle Ages. Land was owned communally by the wholevillage and periodically redistributed in an egalitarianfashion by village elders. Capable individuals had noincentive to improve their farming practices, since therewards would effectively revert back to the commune. Theresult was soil exhaustion and technological backwardness.The peasant commune was a primitive socialist society.   Stolypin blamed the peasant commune for many of the illsaffecting Russia. Since individual peasants rarely owned anyland of their own, they had no reason to respect anybodyelse's property. Whenever the squalor of village life becameunbearable, they attacked the property of landowners,shopkeepers or whoever else who happened to have more thanthey did. These revolts had to be suppressed by force,propelling Russia into a cycle of revolt and repression.   Stolypin's solution was privatization. He wagered that thepeasants would leap at the chance to own their farmsindependent of the village commune. He enacted a land reformthat gave peasants the right to claim the land they worked asprivate property. They could even trade their scatteredstrips for American-style homesteads.   Peasants' distrust of the government ran deep and theirattachment to the village commune was reinforced by centuriesof tradition. But it wasn't long before the benefits ofStolypin's reform became clear. The individual peasant farmercould finally try out the innovative techniques he haddreamed of; finally he could plant alfalfa without having thevillage cattle come and eat it all; finally he could skip theendless bargaining sessions at the village assembly andconcentrate on his own business.   Within a few years, the creaking provincial bureaucracycould not survey the lands and draw up the deeds fast enough.By 1914, over 40% of peasant households held their land asprivate property and many more waited for their petitions tobe processed. To the dismay of socialist intellectuals, thepeasants firmly rejected the notion of communal land tenure.The big gentry estates meanwhile were squeezed out of themarket by more resilient peasant competitors; by 1916, thegentry farmed only 11% of Russia's farmland.   As a result, the efficiency of Russia's farming sectorimproved dramatically. Russian agricultural production in theperiod 1911-1913 was an average of 47% higher than in theperiod 1901-1905. Domestic food consumption rose, butagricultural exports rose even faster, by 61% between the twoperiods. Russia solidified its position as the world'slargest exporter of agricultural products. Higher peasantincomes meant higher consumption of domestic manufactures andgreater accumulation of capital (peasant savings increasedninefold in nine years). Increased export earnings and thesolidity of the gold-backed ruble encouraged foreignbusinessmen who rushed to invest in Russia's booming economy.   Sadly, Stolypin did not live to see his reforms succeed.In 1911, while attending a performance at the Kiev OperaHouse, he was fatally wounded by a leftist gunman. With itsrestructuring only partially complete, Russia was thrown intothe First World War. Strikes and mutinies precipitated a newrevolution in February 1917. Stolypin's newly-empoweredpeasants refrained from joining it. But they couldn't holdback the country's slide into anarchy and terror.   The lesson of Stolypin's reform is that given economicfreedom, even backward peasants can become entrepreneurialand politically conservative. Simply put, privatization pays.But economic reform should be undertaken boldly: Vacillationonly leads to economic deterioration and politicalpolarization. If he is serious about economic reform, Mr.Gorbachev needs a prime minister like Stolypin.   ---   Mr. Paul Klebnikov, a reporter for Forbes Magazine, iswriting a Ph.D. dissertation on the Stolypin reforms.</TEXT></DOC>
