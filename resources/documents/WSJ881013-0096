Cincinnati Bell said its information systems unit won a three-year contract, valued at $85 million to $88 million, to provide NTT with technical services, software and information-management systems.    Tokyo-based NTT, which has annual revenue of about $45.2 billion, said it expects to spend a total of 20 billion yen ($150 million) on the new system, which includes installation and other services provided by subcontractors. NTT didn't identify any of the other companies that put in bids.    The contract establishes Cincinnati Bell as a major competitor in the telecommunications software business overseas. Recently, those markets have been heating up as such large U.S. concerns as Nynex Corp., BellSouth Corp. and Bell Atlantic Corp. have bid for and won large projects in Europe, South America and elsewhere.    The Cincinnati-based concern has pushed aggressively to expand its presence, particularly in Asian markets. Recently, for example, it has won large service contracts from Telecom Australia and Philippine Long-Distance Telephone Co.    &quot;We hope this Japanese project will open even more doors for us,&quot; said John T. LaMacchia, Cincinnati Bell's president and chief operating officer. In an effort to land NTT's business, the company has been lobbying senior Japanese officials for about two years.    Iwao Kidokoro, a senior vice president at NTT's U.S. unit, said the telephone company will use the software systems and services to automate about 1,500 business field offices in Japan.    NTT is undertaking the modernization project in an effort to become more competitive. The project, which will begin in 1990, will enable the offices to handle installation and repair orders, as well as customer requests. Mr. Kidokoro said the company also hopes the system will help it streamline its work force and become more efficient.    Cincinnati Bell's Mr. LaMacchia predicted the contract will &quot;significantly increase the size and revenue&quot; of the company's Cincinnati Bell Information Systems Inc. unit, but he declined to make a more specific projection.    However, a source at the company said the contract will bolster the unit's revenue to $190 million this year and to $300 million in 1989, compared with about $109 million last year. Cincinnati Bell earned $64.4 million, or $2.01 a share, on revenue of $633.8 million last year.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, in a broadly lower market, Cincinnati Bell shares closed at $36.50, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
