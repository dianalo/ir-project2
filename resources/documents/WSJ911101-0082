Although Phibro, a Salomon Inc. unit, and NigerianNational Petroleum Corp. have held talks periodically since1988, negotiations have intensified recently, the peoplesaid. The stake would involve the newly created Phibro EnergyUSA division, which includes, among other things, Phibro'sdomestic oil refining, crude-oil gathering,liquefied-petroleum gas trading and marine fuels.</LP><TEXT>   Terms haven't yet been set. But the structure couldinvolve the exchange of oil, rather than cash, participantsin the negotiations said. &quot;Oil is as good as money in thisbusiness,&quot; said a person familiar with Phibro.   For some time, the Nigerian state oil concern has beeninterested in gaining a foothold in foreign oil-refining andmarketing, oil industry executives said. But discussions withseveral U.S. refiners, including Sun Co. and FarmlandIndustries Inc., have yet to bear fruit.   Wall Street executives said the Phibro negotiations areunrelated to the Treasury auction-bidding scandal at SalomonBrothers Inc., which also is a unit of Salomon Inc. Earlierthis week, Salomon Inc. set aside $200 million in reservesfor potential legal liability from its admissions ofrepeatedly violating government bidding rules atTreasury-note auctions.   &quot;This is not really connected to Salomon,&quot; a Phibroexecutive said. &quot;We've grown phenomenally&quot; over &quot;the pastfour or five years, and we've had a long relationship withNigeria for many years.&quot;   The heightened dialogue comes amid a downturn in earningsat Phibro. Through September, Phibro reported net income of$35 million, down sharply from a record $366 million a yearearlier, according to Phibro's income statement.   Third-quarter earnings were hurt by a $20 million chargestemming from Phibro's restructuring and office relocationsthis year; in June, the firm laid off about 10% of its staff,which now numbers about 420. &quot;Refining margins continued tobe depressed in particular because of low prices for theresidual fuel oil which the company produces,&quot; Phibro said.   As of Sept. 30, Phibro had assets of $3.79 billion, downfrom $5.81 billion at year end. The firm has totalstockholder's equity of $1.18 billion.   Last month, Phibro announced the creation of Phibro USA,which will soon move to Houston from its present location inGreenwich, Conn. Besides its trading prowess, Phibro is thenation's third-largest independent oil refiner, with capacityof roughly 330,000 barrels a day spread among four refineriesin Texas and Louisiana.   Under Salomon Inc.'s new interim chief, Warren Buffett,Phibro wields more weight around the Salomon empire. In anewspaper advertisement announcing Salomon's earnings thisweek, Mr. Buffett went out of his way to praise Phibro'sefforts despite its profit slump.   &quot;In recent years, both Salomon Inc., the parent, andPhibro Energy have been treated by top management as adjunctsto Salomon Brothers,&quot; Mr. Buffett said. &quot;Now, however, we areviewing Salomon Inc. as the owner of two independent andsubstantial businesses, each of which will be measured byreturn on the equity capital it requires.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
