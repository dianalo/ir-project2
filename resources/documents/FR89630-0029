The Actalso requires the Secretary, upon receiving the plan or amendment, to publishimmediately a notice of availability and to publish within 15 days theproposed regulations for public review and comment. Amendment 3 to theFMP was submitted by the New England Fishery Management Council (Council)on April 7, 1989. The notice of availability was published on April 20,1989 (54 FR 15958) and the proposed regulations were published on May 19,1989 (54 FR 21640). Amendment 3 proposed the requirement that all vessels must offload seascallops within a 12-hour time window each day. The intent of the amendmentwas to improve enforcement of the meat count/shell height management standardsof the FMP. After receipt of the proposed amendment package, however, NOAAGeneral Counsel and NMFS Enforcement determined that the proposed regulationscould not be efficiently enforced and thus would not effectively implementAmendment 3. Consequently, under authority of section 304(a)(1)(D)(i) ofthe Magnuson Act, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 1854(a)(1)(D)(i), the changes necessaryfor implementation of the amendment were made to the proposed regulations.These changes to the proposed regulations prompted the Council to questionwhether the amendment sufficiently addressed the impact of the revisedmeasures, whether all the affected sectors of the fishing industry wereincluded in the public hearing process, and whether the burden of the revisedregulations were justified. To allow sufficient time for these questionsto be answered, the Council voted to withdraw the Amendment pending furtheranalysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 650 </ITAG>Fish, Fisheries.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 26, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard H.
