 Many of the small colorvendors hadn't exhibited at the Computer Publishing Conference, and withGraph Expo held just once this year, they had banked on this show to be theirprimary showing of the year.andP;  Also not unexpected was the refrain &quot;preparingfor Drupa,&quot; heard in many of the larger firms' booths.andP;  For the big vendors,Graph Expo was just the warmup for the granddaddy next April and May.andM;Looking back.andP;  OVer the last decade, the key players in the traditional colorprepress market have remained constant.andP;  Scitex, which made its U.S.andP;  debutin 1980, is now firmly entrenched alongside Crosfield and Hell.andP;  together,those three firms account for all but a small percentage of the world's colorprepress systems.andM;Dainippon Screen (DS America in the U.S), which first showed its scanner inthe U.S.andP;  at ANPA in 1980 but didn't really get going until Drupa in 1982,made a strong showing at this year's Graph Expo and seems to be holding itsown as the number four vendor.andP;  Eikonix, whcih premiered its system at GraphExpo in 1982, has struggled to become a presence in the market.andP;  Kodakacquired the firm in early 1985, and at Drupa the next year Kodak talkedabout how it would integrate the Eikonix and Atex systems into a totalsystem.andP;  We have heard little from the company in recent years, but GraphExpo revealed that Eikonix is not only alive but growing.andM;A few companies have tried to enter the color system market and failed.andO;Coulter is notable for having survived as a company (even though theprototype color page makeup system it showed at Print 80 never got off theground); it made a come-back appearance this year with a new film recorder.andM;New companies have appeared as well.andP;  The most serious challenger to theestablished vendors is Diadem, which has just acquired RZ Color Systems toestablish its U.S.andP;  beachhead.andP;  CyberChrome, Networked Picture Systems,Howtek and Imapro are struggling to prove that high-quality color can beproduced on an inexpensive system.andP;  Each has had very limited success, andtheir impact may be more in pushing the technology and market awarenessforward than in tipping the scales of sales away from the establishedvendors.andM;The elusive total system.andP;  The desire to have one complete system that couldhandle text and color composition was strong throughout the decade, but ithas proved a difficult challenge.andP;  The major color vendors have virtuallyabandoned their efforts to include text composition within their systems.andO;All of them are now embracing a link with desktop publishing through the useof the PostScript page description language.andM;Instead, the attempts to provide complete editorial and color systems arebeing made by the composition system vendors.andP;  Bestinfo was first, butIntergraph is well on its way to having similar capability.andP;  AlthoughCompugraphic has curtailed development of its Mosaic system, which was tohave been a fully integrated text and color system, we expect to see othersimilar efforts in the 1990s.andM;One reason that total color systems have not succeeded is the different areasof expertise that are involved in creating color publications.andP;  Designerscreate the concept; illustrators, photographers and artists render andproduce artwork; writers and editors prepare copy; compositors prepare type;retouchers fine-tune the art for production; and the production staff piecesall of it together for a particular press.andP;  Building one system that handlesall of those functions is not just technically difficult; the morechallenging hurdle is how to build one that suits the tastes of professionalsin those different areas.andP;  (The idea that one person will have all of thoseskiils--as the desktop publisher acts as designer, writer, editor, artist andproducer--is still not feasible for high-quality color.andP;  It will happen foroffice-quality color publications as soon as inexpensive plainpaper colorprinters that have PostScript output are introduced.)andM;Even in color production, there have long been divisions along skill lines,and these persist.andP;  Three of the principal skills--photo-retouching, colorseparation, and stripping--had practically no overlap right through the1970s.andP;  Color separation started moving from the camera to an electronicprocess (the drum scanner) during that period, but the same kind of craftknowledge was still required: the scanner was a direct replacement for cameraseparations.andP;  Crosfield and Hell practically owned the market.andP;  In 1977,Crosfield introduced the Magnascan 570, which made it possible for thestripper to leave the light table andmove to the digitizing tablet--anotherdirect replacement.andP;  Photo-retouchers were still working with specialbrushes, special dyes, and painstaking care directly on transparencies.andM;Then, at Print 80, Scitex (a young Israeli company unknown to most peopleoutside the textile industry) introduced to the U.S.andP;  market a product thatcut across craft lines.andP;  It handled stripping, separation and evenretouching.andP;  Furthermore, it did these things on a screen where you could seethe page take shape before your eyes.andP;  It was like nothing that had comebefore.andP;  Crowds packed the Scitex theatre at Print 80 to see demonstrations,with many people coming back several times, trying to understand what thissystem could mean to their companies.andM;Scitex created a sensation, and Crosfield and Hell scrambled to catch up.andO;Each came out with a system that could perform all the Scitex functions.andP;  Butin the end, it turned out that the &quot;one workstation for everything&quot; approachwas not a good fit for many companies.andP;  For one thing, they didn't haveprospective operators with experience in all three functions.andP;  For another,it didn't match their mix of work.andP;  Some, who did catalogs, wanted lots ofimages per page without much retouching.andP;  Others, who did ads andbook-jackets, needed retouching and separation without much stripping.andP;  Stillothers, who did packaging, wanted tints, chokes and spreads but dealt verylittle with contone art.andP;  So each company began offering specializedworkstations to handle these needs.andM;This trend toward specialized workstations continues today.andP;  Now, though, weare seeing some functions being taken over by off-the shelf PCs that passfiles to the color systems.andP;  Increasingly, PCs are handling theimage-placement functions that a stripper would have done.andP;  High-powered PCsare starting to be offered as retouching workstations, and you can get PCsoftware for handling tints.andP;  And text, which has never been handled well oncolor systems, is now conceded to be more appropriately dealt with on PCs.andO;What does that leave to the high-end color systems?andP;  Primarily integration ofthe page and output of the separation films.andM;So separation of functions, the norm in the 1970s, is increasingly the normonce again.andP;  Back then, though, the link that held the steps together wasfilm.andP;  Film went from photographer and retoucher to separator to stripper,there to be joined with film from the compositor and with tints created onfilm in the contact exposure frame.andP;  Now, the links are computer files andfile standards such as PostScript, OPI and DDES.andP;  At each step in the chainis a computer with a different set of tools; the right set, one hopes, forthat stage.andM;This year's trends.andP;  We noted several overriding trends in our introductionon page 3, but within the color market, several new general developmentssurfaced this year.andP;  In no particular order, here are the ones that stoodout.andM;* Support for OPI/desktop links- Many of the stories in this section areabout how color vendor are using Aldus's Open Prepress Interface (OPI) orPostScript in general to transfer information froma microcomputer to aprepress system.andP;  It has become evident that desktop publishing andmicrocomputers are more efficient at designing page geometry than are moreexpensive color systems, and they offer page composition to boot.andP;  The colorprepress vendors are embracing the desktop links, in part because they do notthreaten the core of a prepress system--the color halftoning.andM;* Mixed systems are about to appear.andP;  The spread of desktop links carriesother implications.andP;  The idea that a system may be built by mixing multipleworkstations from different vendors is new in the color prepress industry.andO;But fed by the spread of desktop links, the emergence of exchange standardsand vendor realizations that they will have to coexist with other systems inthe 1990s, the momentum behind open systems is growing.andP;  Between OPI andDDES, it looks as though users are beginning to wrest some control over theirsystems away from the vendors--just as has happened in the monochrome market.andO;As we note in our coverage of Crosfield, embracing standards may prove to bean opportunity, not a threat, for vendors that take that course early, beforebeing forced to do so.andP;  We can only hope that progress toward improving theexisting standards and completing ones that are truly vendor independent willaccelerate.andP;  In the meantime, we are encouraged by the swift adoption of OPIby Hell and Diadem, and by the general adoption of DDES.andM;* Desktop color still a muddy road.andP;  Two years ago, several new PC-basedcolor separation systems marked what looked like a whole new era in prepresscolor production.andP;  This year, some of those companies weren't evenexhibiting, and the new era has a feel quite different from the one manyexpected.andP;  For one thing, desktop separations haven't taken off because ofthe screening limitations of PostScript RIPs.andP;  Without quality colorhalftones, desktop color separation systems have lost much of their earlyappeal.andP;  And without plain-paper color printers, desktop color software isnot yet a mass market.andP;  Thus, the short-term application of desktop colorpublishing in the graphic arts is as a design link into the prepress systems.andO;We expect that to change in the 1990s, as color laser printers and betterhalftone screening become available to the mass market.andM;* Digital proofing arrives.andP;  The first full-fledged direct digital proofingmaching that delivers a contract-quality proof was introduced by StorkColorproofing (see The Latest Word in the last issue).andP;  The leaders in theproofing industry--Du Pont, 3M and Kodak--are busy developing their owndigital systems, some of which will appear at Drupa.andP;  Color proofing systemsare covered in the next main section.andM;* Use of digital videotape.andP;  Digital videotape, which comes on a smallcassette much like audio tape and holds about 2 GB of data, looks verypromising as a medium for archiving and exchanging files.andP;  The cost per tape(about $20) is considerably less than that of erasable optical discs (about$50 per disc), the format is a de facto standard and the drives themselvesare small and readily available.andP;  The access speed of the tape is about 2minutes per tape (it's not a random-access device), which limits itsusefulness for large numbers of small files.andP;  But for one or just a few verylarge files, it may prove more economical than other media.andP;  Crosfield, Kodakand Superset showed the technology.andM;In the following sections, we focus on systems for production of color imagesand pages.andP;  None of these systems compose body copy; some compose headlines;mose handle text as line art.andP;  Trying to keep like systems together, we havecovered the vendors that have added color capabilities to their pagecomposition systems (Bestinfo and Intergraph) in the first section of thisissue, even though the discussion of each is about color.andP;  The difficulty wehave in deciding how to categorize systems is a clear reflection of theblurring distinction between monochrome and color systems.andP;  This time wetried to draw the line between systems that compose text and graphics andthose that make up color pages.andM;There were other vendors that aren't covered here, such as Imapro andCodd-Barrett, which demonstrated approximately what we had seen previously.andM;Color SystemsandM;Crosfield: update on 9500andM;Few prepress companies had a better Graph Expo than Crosfield--it closed $10million worth of orders during the four-day show.andP;  Buyers seem comfortablewith the recent acquisition by Du Pont, maybe the more so because, for thetime being, Du Pont is content to have Crosfield continue to do business asusual.andM;There were several new items in the Crosfield booth and some that were new tothe American market.andP;  The most important was the U.S.andP;  introduction of theSystem 9500.andM;Ready to go.andP;  Crosfield introduced its 9500 system a year ago at IPEX, but itheld the U.S.andP;  introduction until the product was fully operational anddebugged at several European locations.andP;  Although it was demonstrating thefirst level of software, Crosfield says that its U.S.andP;  customers willactually be getting the second software release when their systems aredelivered early next year.andM;The wait may have been a smart strategic decision.andP;  Crosfield was able tomake a big splash at Graph Expo, but more important, customers were seeing aproduct that had already been proven in the field.andP;  Given its level ofperformance, it was an impressive debut.andM;To refresh the memories of those not familiar with the product, the 9500 isthe system that runs on Crosfield's new Galaxy 9000 Unix workstation.andP;  Whenit first announced the Galazy a year and a half ago, Crosfield said it hopedto offer it on an OEM basis, because no one else was offering anoff-the-shelf computer that could handle the color prepress application.andO;Crosfield has since had no OEM takers, and judging from the systems runningon the new Silicon Graphics box, it looks as though other computermanufacturers are quickly filling the void.andP;  Nevertheless, the 9500 is animpressive machine, and its use of industry standards in operating system,peripherals and networking leaves the door wide open for future upgrades.andM;Mixed systems?andP;  The fact that the 9500 is a standalone unit sparked interestin unlikely corners.andP;  Several Scitex customers approached Crosfield about thepossibility of interfacing the 9500 to their systems.andP;  The interface wouldprobably be offline through magnetic tape, although Crosfield wasn't makingany public commitments.andM;We find this scenario intriguing.andP;  The monochrome publishing community ismoving ever closer to adopting vendor-independent standards for exchangingdocuments digitally.andP;  Similar progress in the color market has been slow,with DDES bogged down in political wrangling.andP;  However, with thecontinuous-tone specification complete, the 9500 may be the color prepressworkstation that ignites the move toward mixed systems in the color market.andM;Software.andP;  The 9500 is essentially a stripping station for assembling pages.andO;Its user interface is quite clean, featuring a mixture of icons and menusthat accommodates different levels of operator experience.andP;  Directories areshown as thumbnails of the images or icons of the page.andM;The software is not really a step above that of the current 800 system.andP;  Thedifference is in performance.andP;  Through the use of specialized graphic displaycontrollers, a high-speed bus, fast disk drives and dual-ported memorymanagement, the 9500 loads images off a disk at breathtaking speed--4 MB persecond.andP;  It pans, roams and zooms in real time without delay.andP;  Though it isonly displaying 8 bits of color, the display is quite adequate for pagemakeup.andM;But more important than the display speed is the processing of pagesthemselves.andP;  We built an A4-size page that contained 350-400 MB of data,including 15 images (1 rotated), 3 colored text images, 9 tint blocks, 3vignettes (1 angled) and a star tint, in 39 minutes.andP;  Even more impressivewas the fact that the entire process happened in the background, as theoperator worked on another job.andM;Another application of background processing is the ability to pull imagesoff a scanner while you are building a page.andM;As with previous Crosfield systems, the operator works at low resolution onthe screen, and the page is built in high-res afterward.andP;  The difference isthat with the 9500 the user can do the processing as a true background task.andM;One feature not shown but planned is the addition of the Focoltone colormatching system for tints.andP;  The Focoltone colors include press and substratecompensation; Crosfield says it will provide a lookup table for matchingPantone's colors.andM;The cost of the Studio 9500 is about $360,000 in the U.S.andM;Other news.andP;  Crosfield showed a prototype of enhanced color correctioncapabilities for the Studio 800 that will be offered through a color computerupgrade.andP;  The new software will adjust three types of density marks--purecolors, &quot;dirty neutral&quot; tones and full neutral tones.andM;Crosfield introduced to the U.S.andP;  its Duet and Solor scanners and theMagnascan 634 scanner (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  19/20, p. 73).andP;  Crosfield has alsointroduced an erasable optical disc drive.andM;CyberChrome opens centersandM;CyberChrome did not bring any equipment, preferring (as it often does) toshow output samples.andM;The company is working to establish a network of &quot;imaging centers.&quot;andP;  Theserare CyberChrome licensees, mostly existing color trade shops, that want to beable to receive desktop-format files from customers and add high-resolutioncolor images to them.andP;  The staff at the centers will be trained and supportedby CyberChrome.andP;  Matt Kubitsky, CyberChrome marketing VP, tells us that thecompany insists each center must have at least one experienced colorprofessional, because that is the only way to maintain high color standards.andM;Five licensees have been signed up so far.andP;  They will all be in production bythe end of November.andM;DS discusses OmegaandM;Dainippon Screen introduced, with much fanfare, the &quot;Omega Network.&quot;andP;  Thoughit bears the name &quot;network,&quot; it is really to be thought of as a concept or astatement of company direction.andP;  The concept is illustrated via a set ofthree concentric circles.andP;  The innermost one contains the database of graphicelements and the network hardware and software--the &quot;glue&quot; that binds anymultiple-person electronic publishing activity.andP;  The second circle containssix &quot;development themes&quot;: areas of technology that contribute to systems.andO;The six are input, image processing, linework processing, text processing,data communication and output.andP;  The third and outermost circle contains six&quot;production environments.&quot;andP;  These are the categories of end-user products,given as digital flatbed color scanner, integrated page production system,integrated design system, remote multisite multimedia network, satellitecommunications and direct platemaker.andM;Opening up.andP;  The Omega Network concept proposes a family of products, allinterconnected, solving all aspects of a publishing problem.andP;  That soundsattractive, but we will want to see real products embodying the conceptbefore we are convinced that the Omega Network is more than marketing hype.andM;Frankly, we were more impressed with the decision DS has evidently made toendorse standards and cooperate with other vendors.andP;  At Graph Expo, thecompany said it would support DDES, provide a mechanism for PostScriptimport, and release the specifications of the interfaces for its scanners andits Cadograph stripping station.andP;  This is a healthy sign, we think.andM;A new color system, the Sigmagraph 2800, was introduced at Graph Expo.andP;  Thisis an expanded version of the 3000 series (the top of the DS line) that canhandle simultaneous activity on multiple workstations and supports two ormore scanners.andP;  An &quot;Image&quot; workstation handles color adjustments, retouching,cropping and vignettes; a &quot;Graphic&quot; workstation handles linework and tints.andO;A separate &quot;image data executing station&quot; is used to relieve the system ofheavy processing chores.andM;The Sigmagraph 6000 got an upgrade as well, with the introduction of the6800.andP;  This can support a pari of workstations (instead of a single one) andcan be networked to other 6800s.andM;DS showed several products in prototype form, including the TX-570 text/lineart workstation used for preparing line art and tints) and the SG-2010/2020scanner/recorder combination.andP;  DS sees these units, at about $75,000 each,occupying a niche between desktop and traditional scanners.andM;Diadem goes with OPIandM;Diadem's big news at Graph Expo, of course, was its deal to acquire RoyalZenith (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  4, p. 31).andP;  But there were interesting things toreport about the product line as well.andM;Diadem's main products are its Carat color systems, based on DEC Vaxcomputers.andP;  The Carat 560 is the top-of-the-line system, supporting a fullrange of retouching and page assembly functions.andP;  The Carat 500 is a new,less expensive system for page assembly (stripping) only.andP;  It is intendedprimarily for newspaper, magazine and catalog work.andP;  A typical 560configuration would incorporate a Vax 3800 with 64 MB of RAM and two 850-MBdisk drives.andM;Diadem has about 25 of its 560 systems installed, including five in the U.S.andO;The first installation of a 500 system occurred recently at the Contra CostaTimes in Walnut Creek, California.andP;  An interesting aspect of thisinstallation is that it involves two displays driven by a single Vax.andP;  Thisis possible with a system that works on a multitasking minicomputer, thoughit must hurt performance.andP;  It isn't possible at all with the typicalsingle-user color workstations used with other systems, however.andM;Desktop links.andP;  Diadem, like Hell, has put a lot of effort into its supportof the Open Prepress Interface as a mechanism for tying into the desktopworld.andP;  We were able to see some of the fruits of that effort at Graph Expo.andO;The interface is two way: the Carat system sends low-resolution TIFF files ofscanned images to the Mac or PC, and it receives PostScript pages back.andP;  Thepages contain special PostScript comments that specify the sizing,positioning and cropping of the color images.andM;Diadem's RIP software makes good use of the power of the Vax.andP;  It took abouttwo minutes to process a two-column newsletter page from Quark Xpress.andP;  Theincoming page, which occupied about 40 KB, was converted into ahigh-resolution linework file of about 2 MB.andM;Diadem is developing a new product based on OPI.andP;  Carat-Link will consist ofa number of Macintoshes running PageMaker, networked into a Carat 500.andP;  Thesystem will use Ethernet cabling for local Macs and modems for remotes.andP;  Thesoftware will support queuing and transfer of jobs to and from the hostcomputer, and all users will be able to participate in an electronic mailsystem.andM;In developing Carat-Link, Diadem will be able to take advantage of theVax/Mac connectivity tools that are already available.andM;In addition to the OPI developments, Diadem noted these enhancements to the560 system: the vignette facilities have been improved; anamorphic andperspective distortion are now supported; there are improved tools forenhancing shadow detail; and a bar-code option has been added.andP;  In addition,Diadem has gotten a performance boost of 2 to 3 times by moving from the Vax3500 to the faster 3800.andP;  This has been particularly valuable in improvingthe interactivity of the air-brush and clone-brush tools.andM;Hell focuses on desktop linksandM;Hell used Graph Expo to focus on support for desktop-publishing input.andP;  Hellcame out wholeheartedly in support of the Open Prepress Interface last spring(it was the first major color system supplier to do so), and it demonstratedthe first stage of OPI support (accepting PostScript files as input) live atGraph Expo.andM;At the show, Hell handed out a brochure that it had created as ademonstration of its PostScript capability, called ScriptMaster.andP;  Thebrochure had been created on a Macintosh using PageMaker (with some headlinetext done in FreeHand).andP;  The file was transferred via AppleTalk to aSiemens-labeled Apollo workstation running ScriptMaster--the HyphenPostScript RIP software.andP;  There it was converted into Hell linework format.andO;ScriptMaster uses Bitstream font outlines.andM;The demonstration we saw involved a page with more than 2,000 characters oftext and a few rules.andP;  It was rasterized at a resolution of about 1,800 linesper inch, a process that took about nine minutes on the Apollo once the pagehad been sent there.andP;  The linework file was then transferred to the Chromacomsystem for completion of the page.andP;  The process worked smoothly except for aglitch in getting a color tint area through it: the tint came through asblack.andM;There were no low-res proxy images in the text file.andP;  If there had been, theoperator would have removed them prior to transferring the file to the RIP:no purpose would be served by rasterizing the position-only image.andM;In its finished form, the OPI software will support two-way file transfer(with low-res scans travelling to the Mac or PC for placement and cropping,and completed page layouts coming back).andP;  Hell will also provide its ownoutput driver for the Mac or PC (during development it is using printerdrivers, such as the one QMS supplies).andP;  The Hell driver will, among otherthings, make sure that low-res position-only scans are dropped from the filewhen it is transferred.andP;  Hell plans to release the finished ScriptMasterpackage in the first quarter of 1990.andM;Hell will provide ScriptMaster customers with 200 Bitstream fonts.andO;Additional fonts are available on a 24-hour turnaround basis by calling aspecial Bitstream toll-free number.andP;  The fonts cost $45 each (less whenpurchased in quantities).andP;  With volume discounts and quick font availability,Chromacom sites with ScriptMaster will be able to serve, in effect, asBitstream dealers for their customers.andM;Soft proofing.andP;  In addition to Chromacom-related products, Hell had itsscanner line at the show.andP;  The new product was the P340 Chromalightsoft-proofing workstation for use with the Chromagraph 3000 scanner line.andO;Images are scanned on a 3010 scanner at coarse resolution and stored on disk.andO;From there, the images can be called to the P340 screen for colorcorrections.andP;  The workstation mimics all the scanner's controls, includingthose for highlight/shadow settings, tonal gradation settings, and selectivecolor adjustments.andP;  A split-screen display provides a before/aftercomparison.andP;  Once the P340 screen image is deemed satisfactory, the settingsare transferred back to the scanner for full-resolution scanning.andM;Hell also announced enhancements for its DC 380 and CP 345 scanners.andP;  Bothmachines will now be available in a &quot;turbo&quot; version, with faster CPUs, fasterinput/output selects, and improved contrast controls.andP;  There are alsosoftware improvements, mostly concerned with faster setup and easier storageand retrieval of job parameters.andM;Kodak DesignMaster alive and wellandM;We were not certain whether to expect the DesignMaster product in the Kodakbooth this year, since Kodak has given it a low profile recently.andP;  ButDesignMaster had a very prominent position in the booth, and ther is quite abit of news to report.andM;The most surprising change is that the DesignMaster's innovative flatbedphotodiode-array scanner--a key element since the product's origin atEikonix--has been replaced with a conventional drum scanner, designated the8710.andP;  The flatbed did a good job, we were told, but for scans at the veryhighest level of quality (a market at which DesignMaster has always aimed)the drum technology proved a better match.andP;  Comparable quality would havebeen possible with the flatbed, given additional engineering andmanufacturing improvements, but the resulting scanner would have ended upbeing more expensive than the drum version.andP;  The drum scanner handlestransparent and opaque originals up to 12.5&quot; x 13.25&quot; and scans atresolutions up to 3,200 lpi.andM;The optional vertical CCD camera, which can scan originals up to 24&quot; x 24&quot;,was prominently displayed.andP;  It will continue to be available as a peripheral.andO;And if you already have another vendor's color separation scanner, Kodak willprovide an interface to the DesignMaster workstation.andM;Kodak also showed a stripping station for combining images from the colorworkstation into a page.andP;  (An early version of the stripping station had beenshown previously, in 1986, but it has evolved considerably since then.)andP;  Theworkstation features a 20&quot; x 24&quot; digitizing surface for entering coordinatesfrom a mechanical.andP;  It can handle a two-page spread.andP;  Menus support manystripping functions, including aligning elements, moving them singly or asgroups, rotating them, sizing and cropping them, and moving them in front orin back of other elements.andP;  There are facilities for chokes and spreads andfor filling scanned line art with color tints.andM;Page files aren't actually assembled by the stripping station.andP;  In fact,there are never any final-page files as such.andP;  Instead, the system keepstrack of the location of the elements on the page and the merging step takesplace as part of the output rasterizing process during the production of thefinal films.andP;  The RIP used in this process can support up to four strippingstations.andM;Desktop links.andP;  Like all the color vendors, Kodak has been developing a linkwith the desktop products.andP;  In Kodak's case, the elements are a Mac II on theDesignMaster network and a PostScript interpreter from Custom Applications(CAI).andM;Mac support will be developed in two phases.andP;  Initially, all PostScriptelements will be rasterized in the software and little alteration will bepossible on the imported file.andP;  LAter, this process will be refined so thatline art and tints are converted into DesignMaster's internal format.andP;  Thatwill make it easy to make adjustments to these elements.andP;  But type will stillbe rasterized, so any text editing would have to be done back at the Mac andthe file would have to be rasterized again.andM;Kodak emphasized the Ethernet networking capabilities that have been added tothe DesignMaster.andP;  The network supports the color and stripping workstations,both types of scanners, and the film recorder, as well as Macintoshes.andP;  Filesand peripherals can be shared.andM;Storage is provided by Unix-based file servers, which are equipped to handlethe kinds of data volumes that color images demand.andP;  The minimum serverconfiguration has two 760-MB disk drives, with backup provided by 8mmcartridge tape.andP;  (The 8mm cartridges, developed for camcorder videoapplications, showed up as a backup medium for several systems at the show.andO;They are compact, inexpensive, and relatively fast for tape, and they haveenormous capacity.)andP;  To this configuration can be added one or more erasableoptical disc drives, up to a maximum of 30 GB of storage.andP;  Auto-archivesoftware in the server will automatically write files to tape after aspecified period of nonuse.andP;  It keeps track of image locations, and it willprompt the operator for the right tape cartridge or disk if a requested imageis not available online.andM;NPS adds Hell interfaceandM;Networked Picture Systems announced a hard-wire interface to two Hellscanners and some enhancements to its Page Express system.andP;  The interfacesinitially available support Hell's 341 and 350 analog scanners.andP;  They arelinked to Page Express via the Scanner Peripheral Interface and Networkdeveloped by ThinkSystems.andP;  The interface is in use at Black Dot Graphics, ofCrystal Lake, IL.andM;NPS also announced that it can handle downloaded Adobe fonts in addition toBitstream fonts in conjunction with accepting PostScript files from desktoppublishing programs.andP;  Fonts at resolutions between 300 and 2,540 dpi can behandled by the CAI PostScript processor that NPS uses.andP;  As previouslyreported, text that is imported from PostScript programs can't be editedwithin Page Express because it is treated as line art, although it can becolorized.andM;Other enhancements to Page Express include support for a glass graphicstablet for data input, creation of user-defined drop shadows for any objectson a page, zooming and panning within the display, trapping in1/1,000-of-a-unit increments (millimeters, inches or ems), faster rotation ofimages, and the ability to create color vignettes (specified as vertical,horizontal or splitting out from the center) using prestored colors or newones.andP;  This release, called 2.2, should be available about the time thisissue is mailed.andM;Scitex extends Visionary lineandM;Scitex showed a number of extensions to the Visionary product line, includinga monochrome scanner and Visionary Jr., a low-cost add-on workstation.andM;The monochrome scanner is the Xerox 7650, the 1,200-dpi machine that isbecoming widely used for desktop scanning.andP;  It is initially being used as aline-art scanner, but Scitex will add support for monochrome halftones.andP;  Thecost is $19,950.andM;Scitex had output samples in the booth representing linework (actuallytypeset text in sizes down to 4 points) that had been scanned by either the7650 or the Raystar.andP;  The Raystar results were much cleaner when viewed undera glass, but to the naked eye there was little difference.andM;Visionary Jr., like Visionary, is a customized version of Quark Xpress.andP;  ButVisionary Jr.andP;  can run on monochrome Macs.andP;  There is no support for imagemanipulation, though images are displayed if they have been placed on a pagein Visionary.andP;  Visionary Jr.andP;  is intended to be used by those responsible forworking with the text portion of pages.andP;  It also supports rules and geometricshapes (which may be tint-filled).andP;  Page files can be transferred back andforth between Visionary and Visionary Jr.andP;  Like Visionary, Visionary Jr.andP;  issold by Scitex sites to their own customers.andP;  The price is around $1,000.andM;Two other new Visionary options were shown: a Sony erasable optical disc (forstorage of images) and an interface to the Du Pont 4Cast proof printer.andP;  Theprinter, which Scitex has not yet released for sale, will cost around$100,000.andM;Scitex also showed a variety of communications products and technologies,including a working microwave link joining the two halves of its booth.andP;  Thecompany wants to emphasize its capabilities in communications for suchapplications as imaging at remote printing sites, load-sharing among multipleScitex sites, and intercommunication among multiple local Scitex systems.andM;Color SubsystemsandM;Whatever their name--design system, graphic workstation or otherlabel--systems that offload part of the tasks normally done on a conventionalprepress system are sprouting across the global prepress market.andP;  Scitex,Crosfield, Hell and DS continue to dominate the color prepress market.andP;  Butfirms that offer higher-performance, less expensive subsystems are providinginteresting alternatives to savvy prepress buyers.andM;With few exceptions, these subsystems are being offered by small independentfirms that lack the sales and marketing presence of the big names in theindustry.andP;  Their sales are measured in single units, not double digits.andP;  Atvenues like Graph Expo, IPEX or Drupa, they typically have small boothstucked away at the edges of the floor.andP;  Yet many of them are succeeding,because there still is a need for fast, efficient subsystems that interfaceto the prepress system at a color trade shop.andP;  In some cases, the subsystemis installed at a trade shop customer site.andP;  (The customer may be one thatbuys color or it may be one that does freelance or contract work for thecolor house.)andP;  In others, the color shop is simply looking for an alternativewhen expanding its prepress equipment.andM;The diversity in this market segment is often bewildering to the prospectivecustomer.andP;  From a price standpoint, systems that focus on graphic design,such as Unda, Du Pont's Vaster or Crosfield's Lightspeed, are typicallypriced well under $100,000; those that focus on high-resolution creativedesign, illustration, packaging or retouching generally range from $100,000to $600,000.andP;  From a user's vantage, the operator interfaces and toolsprovided in these systems are difficult to categorize.andP;  They are alsodifficult to differentiate without extensive evaluation.andM;As is our custom, we use Graph Expo as a convenient forum for reviewing thestatus of these products.andP;  We cannot hope to conduct an exhaustive analysisof each one in a show setting, nor can we present a convenient check-listchart that stacks each vendor up against an arbitrary list of features.andP;  Evenin the case of systems that have similar features, the implementations of thesoftware vary widely in sophistication, ease of use, speed and quality.andM;Faced with this quandary, we try to report the news that happened at theshow, along with a status report of each of the vendors covered.andP;  In sodoing, we try to keep you abreast of the lastest developments.andP;  We so doing,we try to keep you abreast of the systems that may have been at the show butfor which there was no news.andP;  In this section, for example, we will not coverDu Pont's Vaster, Xyvision Design's Contex or Hell's Color Workstation, eventhough they were at the show and may indeed be more important to prospectivecustomers than those covered here.andP;  Similarly, we haven't covered theofficial U.S.andP;  launch of Purup's new product line in the U.S.--including newworkstations and direct-to-aluminum-plate output--because we reported on itin depth in Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  3, pp.andP;  34-35.andP;  Purup, which has specialized informs, is now emphasizing its label and packaging functions.andM;In short, to get a better picture of the overall market, we urge you to readall of our coverage of products in this market segment over the last 18months (one reason why we include so many cross-references).andP;  This reportfrom Graph Expo is meant as the latest installment in an ongoing series ofreports on a dynamic market.andM;It is worth noting in passing tht all of the color subsystem news at GraphExpo was from vendors of high-resolution workstations.andP;  The desktop color anddesign workstation vendors has already introduced their latest systemsearlier this year.andP;  Because Graph Expo is geared toward the commercial colormarket, it tends to highlight the vendors that do not market to design andgeneral-purpose markets.andM;AesthedesandM;Aesthedes is a system for designers, but with some production tools.andP;  It seesitself carving a niche between the Mac-based products on the low end and thecolor production systems on the high end.andM;Most of the news at Graph Expo concerned production-related aspects of thesystem:andM;* A new high-resolution raster-to-vector conversion program is available forconverting scanned line-art to an editable, electronic form.andM;* There is now an interface to the Purup 7000 high-resolution outputrecorder.andM;Aesthedes has also shown itself to be very responsive to customer needs forspecial software.andP;  An example is the software that it developed for Cebal inFrance, the world's largest metal can manufacturer.andP;  One type of Cebalproduct involves a can stamped from a flat sheet of aluminum.andP;  The printingon the outside of the can must be done while the sheet is flat; it isdramatically distorted by the stamping process.andP;  Aesthedes developed aprogram that takes into account the effect of the distortion.andP;  It produces animage that, even though it looks strange when printed flat, will assume itsintended appearance once it is distorted by stamping.andP;  The program evensupports tints whose dot shapes are not circular until after the stampingprocess.andM;Aesthedes is still a small enough company to take on custom projects likethis, and as a result it can address some niche needs that other companiescan't.andM;Perhaps the key to Aesthedes's future is whether designers will take up itscause.andP;  If they do, it will be because they find the Aesthedes interfacecongenial to the job they need to do.andM;Aesthedes has focused on interactivity as the key element in its userinterface.andP;  This means, first of all, that the system must be veryresponsive.andP;  Users tire of experimenting and adjusting if a system doesn'tgive immediate feedback.andP;  Since trying things out is at the heart ofdesigning, Aesthedes has made system responsiveness a priority.andM;Few would argue with the importance of fast feedback.andP;  But Aesthedes madeanother, more controversial choice: it designed a system with which thedesigner interacts with both hands on a palette of function keys--hundreds ofthem--spread out on the surface of a touch-sensitive console.andP;  They aregrouped into functional sets, with the more commonly used ones nearer thecenter.andP;  The approach is unconventional, since it is not like either of thestandard ways of dealing with a computer: via an alphanumeric keyboard or (inrecent years) via the mouse-and-menu interface.andP;  But Aesthedes says it is abetter interface for many designers, since they become kinestheticallyattuned to the machine.andP;  It becomes less a computer at arm's length and morean intuitive design tool in the hands.andP;  (Aesthedes makes the analogy of thepianist whose fingers perform their work on the keyboard without consciousthought.)andM;Is this interface really better for design?andP;  We can't say, but it is not tobe dismissed lightly.andP;  Certainly, some Aesthedes operators show impressivemastery of the approach.andP;  In any case, we don't think that the evolution ofuser interfaces ended with the invention of the mouse.andP;  It will takecompanies like Aesthedes, with the courage to try something different, totake us to the next level of human/computer interaction.andM;Barco expands configurationsandM;Barco introduced its high-resolution color graphic design and retouchingworkstation a year ago at ipex (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  3, p. 6).andP;  Since then, thecompany has installed eights systems, four in the UK and four in Europe.andP;  Theapplications are design in color trade shops, photo labs and retouchinghouses and design access studios.andP;  Barco says it has some good prospectsamong and agencies and design studios.andP;  Sales offices are in Belgium, the UKand California.andM;The Barco system is used primarily for creating designs that include newhigh-resolution images created from editing scanned transparencies orphotographs.andP;  As such, it competes with products such as Quantel, Topaz,Superset, Shima Seiki or Scip.andP;  In addition to real-time retouching of imagesat high resolution (up to 8K X 8K), Barco offers 3-D-Wavefront software,which provides three-dimensional special effects.andP;  Like its competitors,Barco's system supports vector operations, but it is not as vector orientedas the Aesthedes, nor is it as production oriented as a Contex system.andP;  Itskey selling point is editing raster images and compositing them with line artand type to create a new transparency or production on a prepress system.andM;This year, Barco has expanded its software to encompass three levels ofproduction design systems and one concept design system.andP;  All share the samecreative graphics software; the differences are in the hardware configurationand the peripherals bundled with the system.andM;All of these systems are based on the Silicon Graphics Personal Irisworkstation with the Barco Calibrator monitor, 150-MB cartridge tape drive,digitizing tablet with pressure-sensitive pen, keyboard and mouse.andM;Creator CD, the concept design system, uses a workstation with a singleprocessor, 12 MB of RAM and a 380-MB disk.andP;  It may interface online or viamagnetic tape to a Barco production system, with an annotation layer used totransfer geometry and image information to the production system.andP;  Itinterfaces to the Howtek flatbed scanner and Versatec proofer, but aproduction system is required for the prepress interfaces.andP;  The price isabout $70,000.andM;There are three production design configurations.andP;  The Creator SP isessentially the same as the CD but with 32 MB of RAM and 1.2 GB of diskstorage.andP;  It handles images up to 4K X 4K in resolution, large enough to doA4-sized images at a maximum line screen of 220 lines/inch or 80 l/cm.andO;Because it cannot be upgraded to the next level, the SP is sold as anentry-level system or an adjunct to the full-blown system.andM;The Creator SPX and MP workstations are based on Silicon Graphics's new Iris4D workstation, which supports multiple processors.andP;  The SPX has oneprocessor, but up to three more may be added.andP;  The MP has four processors.andO;Memory ranges from 32 MB to 128 MB; storage starts at 1.2 GB and may beexpanded four-fold.andP;  Images may be up to 8K X 8K, large enough to do anA3-size image at a 200-line screen.andM;The prices of the production design systems range from $180,000 for the SP toabout $400,000 for the MP.andM;Input and output interfaces are available for Crosfield, DS, Hell and Scitexsystems, the Howtek flatbed scanner (for concept work), a thermal Versatecproofer and video format.andM;The entire font libraries of URW and Bitstream are available for any of theworkstations as an option.andP;  Five URW fonts are standard with the productionsystems and offered as options for the creator CD.andM;Barco has developed its own PostScript interpreter for rasterizing AdobeIllustrator line art into Barco line art or continuous-tone formats.andM;Jensen features OPIandM;Jensen sells a PC-based color stripping and retouching system calledColorPrep.andP;  The product bundles off-the-shelf hardware (a '386-based PC withdigitizing tablet) and programs for page layout and image retouching (TimeArts Lumena, Aldus Page-Maker) with proprietary software for additionalfunctionality, particularly in the area of precision input and adjustment ofpage geometry.andP;  ColorPrep's audience is color printers and color trade shopswho want to exploit advances in computer technology without investing in ahigh-end color system.andP;  At Graph Expo, Jensen demonstrated how ColorPrep canbe used as a link between desktop publishing and high-end systems.andP;  Thefeatured mechanism for this is the Open Prepress Interface.andM;The Jensen approach to OPI is different from others we have seen.andP;  While mostvendors have focused in the issues of rasterizing the PostScript text into abitmap or line-work format, Jensen lets that issue be handled elsewhere.andP;  Thetext portion of the incoming OPI/PostScript file is passed through the Jensensystem unaltered.andP;  (It will be rasterized later, on an imagesetter or on itsway into a high-end color system.)andP;  Similarly, PostScript graphics and OPIcalls for scanned graphics are passed through to the appropriate output file.andO;The Jensen system works primarily with the tint areas and rules.andM;The tints and rules are extracted from the OPI file and converted intoJensen's internal format.andP;  Once in the system, a wide variety of functionscan be performed on them.andP;  These include chokes and spreads and precisealignments that most likely would not have been done on the desktop systemsupplying the file.andP;  Once the file has been modified, it can be sent throughto the destination system in one of the formats Jensen supports: OPI, DDES,and system-specific formats of Hell, Crosfield, Scitex and Chemco.andM;Jensen also supports DDES-specified page geometry as an input to the system.andM;Images can be handled on the Jensen system in a variety of formats, either atlow resolution (for position) or at full resolution.andP;  Several common PC imageformats are supported, but Macintosh-oriented formats (notably TIFF) are notsupported yet.andP;  TIFF support and an optional Mac-compatible disk drive are tobe added soon.andM;In cooperation with an Irish company, Delphis, Jensen is developinginterfaces for color separation scanners.andP;  These interfaces will letseparators add stripping and retouching functionality to their existingequipment at relatively low cost.andM;Jensen systems range in price from about $29,000 to $65,000, includinghardware and software.andP;  There are about half a dozen systems installed sofar.andM;Quantel adds new touchesandM;Quantel showed several new options to its powerful Graphic Paintboxelectronic illustration system.andP;  The hardware was improved by a four-foldincrease in the image buffer, which can now hold images up to 5,400 x 3,700pixels.andP;  This is sufficient to allow manipulation of 18&quot; X 12&quot; spreads thatwill be output at a 150-lpi screen.andP;  The new hardware can be retrofitted toexisting installations.andM;In the retouching area, Quantel showed a new pixel-replication tool and a new&quot;smear&quot; brush that works a bit like dragging a sponge across wet paint.andO;There were also some new shortcuts, such as being able to select a color forpainting directly from an image on the screen, without the intermediary of apalette.andM;For system chores, there was a new background archiving utility and a queuingmechanism for output devices.andM;Scip enters the fieldandM;Scip introduced itself at Graph Expo West a year ago and subsequentlyinstalled its beta site, which began live operations this year.andP;  The companyrecently installed two systems in Ireland thorugh its EEC Distributor,Graphic Communications in Ireland.andP;  Scip has also installed a system atColorLith, a color trade shop in Marlton, New Jersey, its first commercialsale in the U.S.andM;Scip was founded in 1985 by former employees of Comtal, the company thatdeveloped the 3M Color Workstation.andP;  The firm now has 17 employees andspecializes in image processing hardware and software.andP;  ITs product, areal-time retouching system, is targeted at the same graphic arts applicationas the 3M product--retouching of high-res images scanned on a Hell scanner.andO;(Scip is working on a Crosfield interface.)andP;  Its price--about $120,000 tostart--is considerably less than the $175,000 of the 3M product.andP;  It is alsovery different in operation.andM;Scip uses custom hardware built as add-on cards for a '386-based PC, whichdrives the user interface and disck controller.andP;  The interface is a simpleseries of menus that look much like Microsoft Windows.andP;  For example, inScip's job control features, the directories look and act like those ofWindows.andP;  In addition to job control, the main menus cover I/O, filing, thedisplay, masking, compositing, painting and read-outs from the display.andP;  (The3M workstation, in contrast, uses a Macintosh as its controller.)andP;  In somecases, there are pop-down palettes from the main menus for selectingfunctions.andM;Scip's memory and image processing hardware, in conjunction with Scip's 48megabit/sec bus, provides real-time processing of high-resolution images.andO;Typically, the workstation is configured with about 96 MB of RAM--enough towork with two good-size images at the same time.andP;  The system may beconfigured with as little as 64 MB or as much as 128 MB of RAM.andM;The user works with 512K portions of the file at one time, but the responsetime for retrieving different tiles is excellent, because the entire image isloaded into RAM.andP;  Usually, the user works at full resolution on a portion ofthe file, but is is also possible to work with a subsampled overview of theentire image.andM;Scip provides a full array of painting and editing functions comparable toother prepress retouching systems, from point-to-point cloning to local andglobal brushes and filters.andP;  Masking is still a manual operation on thissystem, but Scip can now continue masks across different 512K tiles.andM;The system embodies the mindset of experienced prepress operators.andP;  Forexample, colors are typically selected by specifying CMYK values, rather thanby picking a color from a palette.andP;  When the read-out is turned on, thesystem constantly reports color values as the cursor moves about the screen.andM;Scip has added a scanning I/O station that enables the user to scan directlyfrom the Hell scanner to the erasable optical drive of the Scip workstation.andO;The subsystem, bundled with the MAgicTouch retouching system, brings thesystem price to about $150,000.andM;Although Scip's system is less ambitious in scope than others, its price andsimplicity make an appealing alternative for straight retouching to moresophisticated systems that include line art, text or page geometry functionsas well.andM;Shima tests the watersandM;Shima showed the same software as it took to Siggraph, where we reported onits U.S.andP;  introduction (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  22, p. 22).andP;  The company has twoor three systems installed in Japan and reportedly is about to install itsfirst system in the U.S.andP;  at a color trade shop.andP;  The system, which is usedto create new art for second-generation original transparencies, is strong inthe area of texture mapping--not surprising given that its parent company isa textile machinery firm.andM;At Graph Expo, Shima showed its system to the graphic arts market for thefirst time.andP;  Although its large demo screen drew large crowds of gawkers, itssamples, which were produced from low-resolution scans, did not show thesystem's true potential.andP;  Even so, we are concerned that the system's price($400,000-600,000) and inability to handle anything but continuous-toneoutput may hinder widespread acceptance.andP;  It currently offers CT2T and DDESoutput.andM;Superset gains momentumandM;Graph Expo was a good show for Superset.andP;  It had its largest booth ever, andits position in the front of the overflow area downstairs, which opened anhour earlier than the main hall every day, led to considerable activity inits booth.andM;Sales havd picked up since we last saw the product two years ago.andP;  Itsprimary market in the past year has been photo retouchers seeking anelectronic system to do their work.andP;  The samples produced by its customerswere first-rate examples of the system's power and quality.andP;  Aesthedes is nowSuperset's distributor in Europe, and that agreement has already generatedseveral sales.andM;In the U.S., Superset has opened two new regional sales offices in LosAngeles and Chicago.andP;  It is also represented by Codd-Barrett in Washington,D.C.andP;  and Providence, RI.andP;  All in all, it looks as though Superset has carvedout a small niche for itself as a color subsystem that interfaces to Scitex,Crosfield and Hell prepress systems.andM;New software.andP;  Having new customers always helps generate ideas for softwareimprovements, and Superset has responded well.andP;  It has released updates toits software several times in the last year, and in June it announcedReVision II, the successor to the original system introduced a year earlier.andO;It is now doing point-to-point cloning, variable software zooms, and alteringof transparency and textures through different brushes.andP;  It has added amultipoint linear vignette, a significant improvement over the two-pointvignettes it did before.andP;  However, we would still like to be able to adjustthe points of the vignette after it is created.andM;Perhaps the most notable new feature is global color correction.andP;  The usercan adjust the red, green, blue and lightness graphs over an entire image.andP;  Aselected graph may be saved under a given name and then applied to anotherfile.andM;Another new twist is Superset's use of 8mm videotape as a storage medium.andP;  Aswe mentioned above, this medium shows considerable promise for the prepressindustry.andM;The speed of the system is still excellent--if the file isn't larger thanmemory.andP;  Rotating a 5-MB file, for example, took about one minute.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
