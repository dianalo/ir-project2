Appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee,experienced CIA analysts split sharply over the merits of Mr.Gates's nomination to head the agency. But the net impact ofthe day-long testimony -- and documents released by the panel-- was to damage the former CIA deputy, whose intellectualintegrity and political independence have been questioned bysome senators.</LP><TEXT>   Hal Ford, a longtime veteran of the intelligence field,bluntly told the committee that Mr. Gates exerted pressure onlower-ranking analysts that went &quot;beyond professional boundsand clearly constitute{d} a skewing of intelligence.&quot;Referring to testimony by Mr. Gates, in which the nomineefailed to remember key events related to his tenure at theCIA, Mr. Ford said: &quot;I'm sorry to say it, but the word thatfor me captures his testimony is `clever.' The forgetfulnessof this brilliant officer -- gifted with photographic memory-- does not to me instill confidence.&quot;   Mr. Gates rose rapidly at the agency in the 1980s underthen-Director William Casey. In often emotional, bitingterms, a second former colleague portrayed the nominee aspandering to the conservative, anti-Soviet outlook of Mr.Casey. &quot;Gates's role . . . was to corrupt the process and theethics of intelligence,&quot; said Melvin Goodman, who battled Mr.Gates as a member of the Soviet analysis section of the CIA'sintelligence division. &quot;He was Casey's filter in theDirectorate of Intelligence. He protected Casey's equity.&quot;   Among the documents released yesterday are previouslyclassified papers showing that the CIA's top managementpressed for a 1985 analysis making the case for possibleSoviet complicity in the attempted assassination of Pope JohnPaul II. Mr. Gates will have an opportunity to defend himselfbefore the panel, but the papers lend support to allegationsthat he failed to accurately represent the framework of thestudy, whose own authors admitted it lacked balance.   In addition, although the nominee has sought to play downhis role in the early stages of the Reagan administration'sarms sales to Iran in the mid-1980s, the new documentssuggest he lent support in May 1985 to a CIA memorandum thatserved Mr. Casey's purposes in supporting selective armssales through third countries such as Israel or Brazil.   Graham Fuller, the paper's author and then a senior CIAofficer for the Mideast, angrily rejected suggestions that hehad been used by Mr. Gates or Mr. Casey. But he acknowledgedthat Mr. Gates supported his decision to reject objections bythe CIA's own Soviet analysts that the memo was premised onan overblown view of Moscow's influence in Tehran.   Yesterday's testimony goes to the heart of theintelligence-gathering process and what senators see as thecommittee's mandate to protect the independence of the CIA.After weeks of generally neutral testimony piecing togetherthe facts of the Iran-Contra affair, the voices atyesterday's session were pointed and personal. Rarely havethe inner workings of intelligence analysis been so exposed,and the atmospherics combined the cattiness of a collegefaculty spat and the sporting competition of stepping into aring.   Mr. Fuller expressed dismay that the &quot;grays&quot; ofintellectual differences had become transformed by Mr.Gates's critics into a &quot;black and white picture of evil.&quot; Inhis own testimony, however, the former analyst said Mr. Gateshad been slow to recognize changes in the Soviet Union in themid-1980s. And he said that pressures and an unhealthy splitwithin the agency appeared to have damaged promising younganalysts.   Jennifer Glaudemans, a 32-year-old former Soviet analyst,has told the committee of Mr. Gates dressing down anembarrassed colleague in front of others because his viewswere inconsistent with Reagan administration policy regardingLibya. And in a series of anecdotes, Mr. Goodman, now aprofessor at the National War College, portrayed the risingyoung deputy as heavy-handed in suppressing dissent over theSoviet role in the Third World.   Mr. Gates, an ardent proponent of aid to the Afghanresistance, overstated the impact of new weaponry given tothe guerrillas, Mr. Goodman said, and quashed analysischallenging the military effectiveness of the disparatefactions opposed to the Soviet-backed government in Kabul. Inthe case of Libya, Mr. Goodman recalled a Gates memo in the1980s that advocated U.S. bombing to &quot;change the map of theregion,&quot; and when analysts wouldn't give Mr. Gates what hewanted, the former deputy shopped around for one who would,the professor said.   &quot;At one point in the coordination process,&quot; Mr. Goodmansaid of a paper related to the Soviet threat in Africa, &quot;BobGates says, `This is the paper that Casey wants, and this isthe paper that Casey is going to get.'&quot;   The late director had an early preoccupation with anyevidence of Soviet involvement in terrorism, and in thiscontext, the assassination attempt on the Pope was a causecelebre -- and source of angry disputes in the agency. The1985 analysis now at issue was structured to make a best casefor Moscow's involvement, and though a cover note firstexplained these conditions, it was later dropped beforepublication. Mr. Gates, then head of the intelligencedivision, circulated the paper under his own note praisingthe paper as &quot;comprehensive,&quot; but a subsequent CIA reviewcriticized the product as &quot;spotty&quot; and suffering from beingrushed through by management without due attention given toconflicting evidence.   &quot;We found no compelling reasons to rush this paper tocompletion without benefit of all expert views,&quot; reads thecritique, which had been classified. &quot;Our interviews have notunearthed any reason except management's desires to finish itquickly. Moreover, everyone we talked to who was involved inthe review and coordination process views the shape and thetone of the key findings, and the deletion of the explanatoryscope note, as having been inspired, if not directed by theseventh floor,&quot; a reference to the top management offices atCIA headquarters.</TEXT></DOC>
