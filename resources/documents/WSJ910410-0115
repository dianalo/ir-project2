Their appetites reflect their view that Europe's andJapan's economies are slowing, and interest rates there areeither falling or are soon expected to. That's bullish forbond prices -- and yields in these markets are generallyhigher than in the U.S. As rates drop stocks should rally,too; many of them already are cheaper than U.S. stocks.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, smaller Pacific Basin economies remain strongand are expected to get an additional export-led boost whenthe U.S. pulls out of recession later this year.   A big caveat for American investors is the strengtheningdollar. It's up more than 15% against European currencies andnearly 6% against the yen in the past eight weeks, andfurther gains are forecast. A climbing dollar eats intoforeign earnings and can even turn overseas investment gainsinto losses.   Several managers like Asia's burgeoning stock markets,partly because of the increasing trade over the past fiveyears between Japan and such Pacific Basin countries asMalaysia, Indonesia, Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore andThailand. &quot;As a group, they are going great guns,&quot; saysNicholas Bratt, managing director and head of overseasinvestments at Scudder, Stevens andamp; Clark Inc. &quot;In anenvironment of rapid economic growth, you're going to getrapid corporate profit growth.&quot;   But &quot;in the immediate future,&quot; Mr. Bratt cautions, thesestock markets in general will &quot;tread water&quot; around currentlevels because &quot;markets don't go up in straight lines, andwe've had a good first quarter.&quot; He also warns that &quot;peopleare going to have to be selective. It's going to be a year ofstock picking rather than market picking.&quot;   Far Eastern stocks that Edinburgh Fund Managers PLC likeinclude P.T. Gudang Garam, a big Indonesian cigarette maker,and P.T. Goodyear Indonesia. P.T. Goodyear, 85% owned byGoodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co., sells tires throughout Asia andshould show per-share earnings increases of 30% annually forthe next three years, according to the Scottish moneymanager.   Indonesia's stock market has fallen 7.6% in the past sixmonths. But with 26% interest rates about to decline alongwith inflation, Iain Watt, investment director at Edinburgh,sees Indonesian shares rebounding handsomely.   In Hong Kong, the firm is buying Luks Industrial Co., aTV-set maker, and Henderson Land Development Co., a builderof low-to-medium priced apartments.   Japanese stocks, long derided as overvalued by Westernportfolio managers, now have some fans. Francis A. Scotland,a partner at Bank Credit Analyst Group, a Montreal-basedeconomic and financial research firm, predicts that fallinginterest rates will make the Tokyo market one of the world'sbest performers over the next nine months. With growthslowing, the Bank of Japan &quot;is starting to put juice into theeconomy, and that's the kind of news stock markets like,&quot; hesays.   Europe is a mixed bag. Growth is slowing, and the profitoutlook is dismal. But in several countries, inflation islower than normal and interest rates are falling. &quot;Marketstend to react more to falling interest rates than economicgrowth,&quot; observes Jeffrey M. Weingarten, director ofinternational equity research for Goldman Sachs InternationalLtd. in London. Moreover, he says, &quot;virtually all markets inEurope are undervalued relative to the U.S.&quot;   Mr. Weingarten thinks British, Swedish, Spanish, Italianand, to a lesser extent, French stocks offer Europe's bestopportunities. Goldman Sachs's picks include food, drink andhotel conglomerate Grand Metropolitan PLC; food retailer ASDAGroup PLC; Glaxo Holdings PLC, a big pharmaceutical firm; andtwo big insurers, Legal andamp; General Group PLC and PrudentialCorp. PLC.   In Sweden, it's AB Astra in drugs and Asea AB inelectrical equipment. Mr. Weingarten's Spanish choicesinclude two utilities that would benefit from lower interestrates: Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A. (Endesa) andIberduero S.A. An Italian favorite is Societa FinanziariaTelefonica P.A., (STET) in telecommunications.   However, political and economic disorder in the SovietUnion is casting a shadow over the mark and German markets, ashroud that can extend to the rest of continental Europe.What makes global investing &quot;such a lethal cocktail right nowis the negative sentiment about Germany and the U.S.S.R.,&quot;says Geoffrey Dennis, an international strategist at JamesCapel Inc.   Even without Soviet turmoil, investors are wary ofGermany. The skyrocketing costs of bailing out the formerEast Germany and rising wage demands are putting upwardpressure on interest rates. Nevertheless, Magnus vonSchlieffen, head of research at BV Capital Markets Inc., aU.S. unit of Germany's Bayerische Vereinsbank AG, argues thatGerman interest rates will begin to fall in the fourthquarter. Mr. von Schlieffen asserts &quot;the Bundesbank won'tkeep monetary policy so tight that Germany will slip intorecession.&quot;   He recommends stocks of companies that will benefit fromthe flow of government cash to the east: electrical giantSiemens AG; telecommunications equipment maker StandardElektrik Lorenz AG; Linde AG and Mannesmann AG in the machineand engineering sector, and Viag AG, a big utility. Anotherfavorite is retailer Karstadt AG.   Bond investments stand to benefit from the combination ofslowing economies, poor profits and falling interest rates,contends Thomas J. Berger, director of fixed income atLombard Odier International Portfolio Management Ltd. inLondon. Lombard Odier likes &quot;the non-dollar, medium-yieldingEuropean markets,&quot; Mr. Berger says, particularly France,Belgium, Denmark and bonds denominated in the EuropeanCurrency Unit, a weighted average of 12 currencies. His firmis also buying Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian governmentbonds.   Mr. Berger contends bonds will benefit from investorsdiverting part of their portfolios to higher-yielding,long-term securities from short-term instruments, where ratesare falling. And, he says, with real estate markets underpressure, insurance companies will allocate more cash tobonds. Meanwhile, many corporations are selling assets toretire debt, thus tightening the supply of bonds.   Even so, &quot;Equity market returns will exceed bond marketreturns this year,&quot; predicts S. Dewey Keesler, a generalpartner at Oechsle International Advisors in Boston. He saysstocks in many countries &quot;are very cheap. The clear exceptionis the U.S.,&quot; which &quot;doesn't stack up well on a global basisright now.&quot;   Mr. Keesler predicts world-wide corporate profits willbounce back strongly in 1992 and 1993. Meanwhile, stocks helikes include Varity Corp., a Canadian auto parts and farmmachinery company; Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., a Hong Kongconglomerate that's big in the local residential propertymarket, and Hongkong Telecommunications Ltd. In Japan, heowns Kyocera Corp. in ceramics, semiconductors and (through aholding in another company) cellular telephones; Nikon Corp.for its semiconductor equipment manufacturing, and SharpCorp. for its liquid crystal display business.   In Britain, Mr. Keesler is buying shares of Shanks andamp;McEwan Group PLC in waste management services; Beazer PLC inbuilding materials; Grand Metropolitan, and HuntingdonInternational Holdings PLC, a biological safety andenvironmental testing company. The latter three earn a lot oftheir profits in the U.S., so their stocks offer an indirecthedge against a rising dollar, he says.   ---           What Global Money Managers Are Buying                                                                                                                                                                                                                 HONG KONG                                                                                                        -- Luks Industrial Co. -- Hongkong Telecom Ltd.
