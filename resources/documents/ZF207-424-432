upgrade to the Mac operating system, at its SystemSoftware Press Seminar.System 7.0 will remove a number of limitations, suchas the 8-megabyte memory limit, while adding powerful features such as moreflexible printing, improved font management, and the ability to customize theSystem through user-defined scripts.andP;  Apple did not announce a ship date forSystem 7.0, characterizing the presentation as a disclosure of upcomingtechnology (underscored by the fact that all speakers wore informal attire).andM;Virtual memory, using hard-disk space as an extension of RAM, will enableusers to run large applications or simultaneous multiple applications with aslittle as 2 megabytes of real RAM.andP;  Only the Mac SE/30, II, IIcx, and IIx,which have, or can accommodate, paged-memory capability, will be able to usevirtual memory.andM;Full 32-bit addressing will enable a total contiguous reach of 4 gigabytes ofvirtual memory or 128 megabytes of RAM.andM;Outline-font technology will scale printed or displayed fonts to any sizewith much less jaggedness than current font-scaling techniques.andP;  Existingapplications will use these new fonts without modification, and many majorfont publishers have already announced production of their fonts in this newformat (refer to this month's DTP section).andM;A new Finder will be able to really find a file by opening its folder as thefront window, with the file highlighted and ready for action.andP;  Document views(by Icon, by Name, and so on) will be customizable.andP;  You'll be able to assignseveral names to one file and use those aliases in multiple folders, allowingredundant organizational schemes without requiring redundant copies of files.andO;(This will even work for files on a remote server.)andP;  Applications will joinDAs on the Apple menu.andM;Installation of fonts, DAs, sounds, and other System resources will beaccomplished by simply placing them in the System folder.andP;  They can beremoved just as easily by dragging them out.andM;InterApplication Communications (IAC) lets programs share data, locally orover a network, in real time or on demand.andP;  For example, one application canprocess data from another program and return the results in a standardformat.andP;  Live Links between documents will enable a section of a documentcreated in one application to be &quot;published,&quot; so that one or more documentscreated in other applications can &quot;subscribe&quot; to it -- similar to filesharing, but extending the concept to parts of documents, including text,graphics, and numeric data.andP;  When a published document is saved, the changeis reflected in other documents that subscribe to it (e.g., that have pastedit in).andP;  Applications will communicate with each other using a standardprotocol driven by Apple Events, and these intra-application messages can behandled immediately, if the addressee is active, or they can be stored andforwarded later.andP;  User-written scripts will automatically drive a complexseries of multiapplication functions.andM;Database access will be facilitated through a common language, CL/1, allowingMacs to query and modify data residing at remote sites, including mainframes.andO;The connection and update mechanism can be totally transparent; the user neednot know where the published data resides.andM;Communications will be simplified for file transfer and terminal emulation.andO;User will be able to add new terminals or features simply by dropping filesinto the System folder.andM;Printing will be far more flexible.andP;  A single document will be able to have amix of portrait- and landscape-oriented pages.andP;  Background printing will bepossible with all printer types.andP;  You'll be able to redirect queued printjobs to any accessible printer -- overriding the original Chooser selection.andM;Developing and upgrading applications will be simplified because Apple willprovide &quot;toolboxes&quot; containing much of the underlying logic that softwaredevelopers must now each reinvent for themselves.andP;  This should yield shorterdevelopment times and smaller, more powerful, and more stable applicationswith more consistent interfaces.andP;  System 7.0 will include toolboxes forcommunications, database access, and printing.andM;Any Mac from the Plus on up will be able to run System 7.0, but it will needat least 2 megabytes of RAM.andP;  Apple intends to move its entire product lineto System 7, but it will continue to ship System 6 with 1-megabyte Macs andwill provide technical support for both versions.andP;  (And networked printerswill operate on networks that include a mix of Macs running the two Systems.)andM;All existing applications that follow published Macintosh programmingstandards will run under System 7.0 and will immediately take advantage of afew of its features.andP;  Most System capabilities, however, will be availableonly through application-software upgrades (which may simply need to tap intothe System-level routines).andP;  Developers will receive early releases of System7.0 and its tools this fall.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
