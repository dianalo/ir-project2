Consob, the Italian stock-exchange regulatory body, said BNL's shares could be readmitted to the Bourse once &quot;the market has been given all the information necessary to make an informed decision.&quot;    The shares were suspended last month after the disclosure of unauthorized lending commitments to Iraq made by the bank's Atlanta branch. Their disclosure led to the resignation of BNL's chairman and its director general.    Even before the Iraqi lending was disclosed, state-owned BNL, Italy's biggest bank, was ordered by the Bank of Italy to boost its capital. BNL's new chairman, Giampiero Cantoni, and its new director general, Paolo Savona, will outline the planned recapitalization Wednesday.    BNL will receive a cash infusion from two of its shareholders -- the state insurance fund INA and the state pension fund INPS. In addition, INA will issue a subordinated loan.    The remainder of the new cash should come in part from the Italian Treasury, which is BNL's largest shareholder, and in part from net income during the current year. </TEXT></DOC>
