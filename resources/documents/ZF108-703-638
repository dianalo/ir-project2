 Improved productivitygenerally translates into more products for less money.andP;  Productivityimprovement usually is an important management goal.andM;Information systems managers tell me they believe productivity is improvingin information systems.andP;  Most say they have done more this year than they didlast year with no more, and sometimes fewer, resources.andP;  Ask around foryourself.andP;  I think IS executives will tell you to productivity of theirorganizations is increasing.andM;Yet we read in the information systems press that IS productivity is barelyincreasing.andP;  Many industry gurus report productivity gains of no more than 3percent to 4 percent during the past decade.andM;On the other hand, the computer-aided software engineering vendors talk aboutdramatic productivity improvements.andP;  Their literature and their salespeopleclaim productivity gains of 50 percent or more are achievable with CASEtechnology.andP;  Unfortunately, studies by organizations such as WashingtonUniversity in St. Louis dispute these claims.andM;LEt's explore productivity concepts, the challenges of measuringproductivity, and some actions organizations can take to improve in thisimportant area.andM;One of our problems with productivity relates to defining the term.andP;  Does itmean producing more things per unit of work?andP;  This is a common definition.andO;In information systems, managers talk about lines of code, and if they canproduce more lines of code per person per month, productivity must be goingup.andM;Unfortunately, lines of code is not a good measure of productivity.andP;  Here'swhy.andP;  Let's assume an organization needs a job done that we will call X.andO;Let's assume we write X in assembly language and it takes one person-year ofeffort that produces 1,000 lines of code.andP;  At the end of the job, X has beendelivered to the end user and it works right.andM;Let's replay that situation, this time coding X in Cobol.andP;  Coding in Coboltakes one person-year of effort and is done in 500 lines of code.andP;  Both jobsproduce the same capability for the end user, which is X.andP;  Both take oneperson-year of effort to accomplish, but one has twice as many lines of codeas the other.andM;Can we assume from this that writing in assembly language is twice asproductive as writing in Cobol?andP;  I don't think anyone would answer yest tothat question.andP;  Clearly, one cannot equate a line of one language with a lineof another.andM;Our big problem, then, in productivity, is defining the thing we produce.andO;Until we can get a common definition of what we make, productivity is asomewhat abstract concept for most IS organizations.andM;What we produce is being redefined as functionality delivered to ourcustomer.andP;  Alan Albrecht of JBM Corp. developed a process, called functionpoints, to measure output.andP;  A function point is a customer's view of whatinformation systems deliver.andM;However, some industry gurus believe function points are not the correct wayto measure many of our processes.andP;  Individuals like Capers Jones havedeveloped feature points and the Norton Nolan group has introduced Mark IIfunction points as alternatives to Albrecht's function points.andM;Gauging ProductivityandM;The bottom line is that we have to agree on the thing we produce before wecan measure productivity.andP;  Lines of code doesn't work; programs produceddoesn't work; information systems produced doesn't work; and what theinformation manager thinks is not a good way to measure productivity changes.andM;Being busy, working overtime and working harder are not the correct bases formeasuring productivity.andM;The second way is the algorithm for assessing productivity.andP;  The most commonone is things produced per resource.andP;  If we define the thing produced and theresources used to produce it, a simple division provides a gauge ofproductivity.andM;A second, and better, measurement of productivity is value added.andP;  Thevalue-added method requires you to calculate how much the product has beenchanged or improved and then divide that value improvement by the resourcesused.andM;The significant difference between the two methods is quality.andP;  In the firstmethod, we were concerned about producing things; in the second method,value.andM;Let's look at a simple example.andP;  If we produce the same functionality Xdiscussed above and if it takes a person-year to produce it, our productivityformula would tell us that we could produce X in one person-year.andP;  However, Xmight have defects in it.andM;In the products-produced approach to productivity measurement, defects orerrors would not matter.andP;  However, in our value-added formula we have toreduce the productivity by correcting defects, because they add no value tothe product.andM;What does all this mean to an information systems group?andP;  The answer is thatwhat gets measured happens.andP;  If you don't measure productivity, you'reprobably not significantly improving productivity.andP;  If you measure it andtake steps to increase it, you probably will achieve an increase.andM;Our Quality Assurance Institute surveys show that less than 5 percent of theinformation systems groups measure productivity.andP;  One could conclude that atleast 95 out of every 100 information systems groups do not know if theirproductivity is increasing or decreasing.andM;I think information systems organizations need to take four actions toimprove productivity improvement:andM;* Establish an information systems vision of improving productivity.andM;* Define the product or item that your information systems group produces.andO;Our QAI recommendation is function points.andM;* Get a productivity formula.andP;  QAI recommends the value-added approach.andM;* Do it.andP;  Begin a productivity measurement program.andP;  Set goals and instituteprograms to achieve those goals.andM;William E.
