(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When L. Douglas Wilder takes the oath ofoffice in Virginia on Saturday, he faces the pressures of a budgetcrunch and of history: He will be the nation's first elected blackgovernor.   ``I feel that, but ... it's not a weight,'' says Wilder, alawyer who became the state's first black lieutenant governor fouryears ago.   Wilder, who turns 59 in a week, said he recognizes he is a modelfor other blacks seeking high political office.   ``I am aware that any mistakes I make will hamper or curtail themomentum,'' he said in an interview. ``I will be working very muchso to see that that doesn't happen.''   Wilder's inauguration comes as the state's economic boom of the1980s is slowing. Gov. Gerald L. Baliles has ordered cuts to closean $181 million revenue shortfall in the fiscal year ending June30. He has proposed further cuts in the 1990-92 budget.   Wilder has taken plenty of ribbing that he picked a bad time tobecome governor, but he disagrees.   ``The true test of leadership sometimes doesn't come when thingsare good,'' he said. ``It requires innovation. I welcome thatchallenge.''   Wilder may even benefit from the economic hard times if he showshe can hold down state spending, observers say.   ``He knows that. He's not terribly upset by all this,'' saidLarry Sabato, a political analyst at the University of Virginia.``If he can assure that western civilization doesn't collapse,he'll be hailed as having accomplished a great deal.''   Wilder's 20 years of experience in public office and hismagnetic personality bode him well, legislators and analysts say.   ``Doug Wilder knows the system. He's a product of it,'' saidstate Delegate Clifton A. ``Chip'' Woodrum, a Democrat. ``DougWilder can charm the bark off a tree.''   But Wilder also has a reputation for ruthlessly punishing hispolitical enemies.   ``He's a very complex person. He can be enormously charming. Hecan also be extremely vindictive. We have to see what side of thepersonality predominates during the term,'' Sabato said.   Former Republican state Sen. Ray L. Garland, who served withWilder in the Senate, said the Democratic governor-elect gets alongwith most of the state's 140 legislators, and has managed to remainindependent of the state's powerful business lobby.   ``I think he ... will take a very independent line,'' Garlandsaid. ``The one negative is he's never had any experience runningany sizable enterprise.''   Analysts said Wilder's portrayal of himself as a fiscalconservative, which began with his run for lieutenant governor in1985, should help him if he seeks a U.S. Senate seat or nationalpolitical office after his four-year terms ends. Virginia governorscannot succeed themselves under state law.   Wilder has said the state's financial crunch may keep him fromfilling a campaign pledge to cut sales taxes on food andnon-presciption drugs.   His administration may be haunted by another tax break approvedlast year for retirees. To satisfy a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, thelegislature approved pension tax relief that will cost $235 millionduring the next two years. The state could have to pay $400 millionmore to retirees if the courts rule the tax break must be maderetroactive for three years.   Wilder also faces challenges in the areas of health andcorrections, where demand and costs are rising.   To curb the costs of health care, Wilder said he would considerlimiting Medicare benefits for the elderly who can afford theirhealth costs.   In corrections, Wilder said he would support more alternativesto incarceration such as electronic monitoring of offenders intheir homes and greater use of prison labor on state projects.   Wilder said he wants to build on previous transportation, tradeand education initiatives, but also wants to distinguish hisadministration as one devoted to youth and family.   With such an ambitious agenda, ``I'm going to have more on myplate than I can say prayers over,'' Wilder said.</TEXT></DOC>
