(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A candidate for Sonoma Countysupervisor whose handsome, square-jawed face appears smiling oncampaign posters has angered some women who claim he is using hislooks to win election.   Tim Smith, 37, was the object of a demonstration Tuesday byplacard-carrying women protesting the ``glitzification'' of countypolitics.   ``He'd look better standing next to Vanna White than he doesrunning for office,'' said Bebek McGee, leader of the demonstrationdowntown.   She claims Smith spends too much money and time wooing femalevoters between 18 and 35 with his glossy, lavishly illustratedbrochures showing the blond, blue-eyed candidate.   ``You don't vote for someone because you think he's a hunk,''McGee said.   Smith, who was an aide to U.S. Rep. Doug Bosco, said he isamused by the criticism. ``Whose picture was I supposed to put onmy signs?'' he asked.   Neither of Smith's rivals in the non-partisan race is picturedon campaign posters in the county, where issues such as sewagetreatment plans and building permits typically stir politicalpassions.   The most recent polls show Smith running a close third in hisdistrict behind Eric Anderson and Jack Healy, candidates shorter onlooks and money.   Men tend to back Healy, 62, a Santa Rosa councilman moredevelopment-oriented than his two rivals, according to the polls.</TEXT></DOC>
