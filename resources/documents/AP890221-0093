The Ohio River spilled over its banks from Louisville, Ky., toCairo, Ill., and was expected to continue rising all week, theNational Weather Service said. The high water and stiff current shutdown a ferry and hindered barge loading.   Smaller rivers were also on the rise from Kentucky to Louisianaafter a weekend respite from storms that had dumped up to 11 inchesof rain over the area last week.   The weather service issued a flash flood watch for all ofTennessee, for eastern and southeastern Kentucky and West Virginiaand parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Virginia and Ohio.   Flooding closed roads and damaged homes in Florence, Ala., earlytoday, and roads were reported under water in central Tennesseeafter more than 2{ inches of rain fell Monday evening.   In western Kentucky, a 19-year-old woman died Monday when shelost control of her car on a wet highway and hit a truck.   In the central part of the state, which received up to 3 inchesof rain in 24 hours, searchers on Monday discovered the body of oneof two men missing since their van got stuck in high water in HardinCounty last Thursday. The search for the other man resumed thismorning.   About 50 miles west, in Stanley, Ky., a school bus tilted on itsside in flood waters up to its midsection. The children and driverwere inside the bus for at least 30 minutes before they were rescuedand loaded into two small boats, according to firefighter RickFulkerson of the Stanley Volunteer Fire Department.   None of the children was injured. Richard Coy, a Daviess Countysheriff's deputy who discovered the bus, said there were some tensemoments before the boats arrived because the bus was slowly sinkingin the ditch.   ``The boat ride was fun, but getting stuck wasn't fun,'' saidfifth-grader Marshall Coleman. ``It was kind of scary. A whole bunchof people were crying.''   The Ohio River ferry between Cave In Rock, Ill., and Marion, Ky.,shut down Monday and its operator, Bill Patton, predicted it wouldbe out for at least a week.   The river covered the road on the Kentucky side, Patton said.``It's swift and full of trees and logs and everything else.''   Northbound river traffic was having a hard time fighting thecurrent, Patton said. While 10 mph is the average speed goingupriver, towboats were fighting to reach speeds of 2 mph.   The Ohio's high level has interfered with operations at theOwensboro Riverport Authority. Grain can't be loaded onto bargesagain until water levels fall enough for the barges to move under afixed loading spout, said port director Janet Douglas.   Of Kentucky's major rivers, those in the western half of thestate posed the greatest problems with the new rainfall because ofbackwater flooding from the Ohio, the weather service said.   The Rolling Fork and Green rivers, in central and southwesternKentucky, respectively, were above flood stage today.   At West Point, Ky., which lies just south of the Ohio, Mayor GeneSmith said water had receded a few inches Monday, but 42 houses thathad to be evacuated the day before remained flooded.   The flood knocked out pumps at a waste treatment plant, causingraw sewage to be discharged into the river, Smith said. But he saidthe worst appeared to be over.   ``Based on our old-timers, and based on the forecast, we're notanticipating any additional flooding,'' he said.   Despite the new rain, Tennessee officials said only a fewfamilies in the Portland area, northeast of Nashville, had to beevacuated due to flooding.   ``At 1 o'clock this morning things looked really dim,'' saidCecil Whaley, an operations officer for the Tennessee EmergencyManagement Agency. ``We had that front with all that rain coming infrom Arkansas that was supposed to hit us but it turned off andheaded toward northern Mississippi and Alabama instead.''   In Obion County in northwestern Tennessee, about 130 peopleremained away from their homes after being flooded out last week.   Tennessee officials also found at least one bright spot. The townof Lebanon, which was hard hit by last week's floods, appeared to beescaping the newest round of flooding.   ``I don't understand these things,'' said said Bob Cayler,operations officer with the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency,``I just report them.''   In Alabama, officials said parts of Lauderdale, Morgan, Colbert,Lawrence and Limestone counties experienced minor flash flooding asa wave of heavy thunderstorms passed over the area.</TEXT></DOC>
