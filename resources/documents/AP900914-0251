The latest inflation rate is 0.3 percentage points higher thanthe financial markets had expected, and is at its highest levelsince February 1982, when it stood at 11 percent.   The figure is also higher than the rate Prime Minister MargaretThatcher inherited in 1979 from a Labor Party government she hadchastised for loosing control of the economy.   ``After 11 years in power the government that promised us stableprices has delivered us an inflation rate of 10.6 percent,'' saidlawmaker John Smith, the Labor Party's spokesman on Treasurymatters.   But Norman Lamont, the Treasury's chief secretary, said onBritish television: ``We will be content at the election to bejudged on our record. Our record over the lifetime of thisgovernment is very much better than what we inherited, and you mustnot forget that.''   The government blamed the surging inflation on higher oil pricescaused by the Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, as well as a jumpin food prices caused by drought.   Britain has by far the highest inflation rate among the majorindustrialized nations. Italy's 6.2 percent rate is second.   The government's forecast that high interest rates wouldmoderate inflation by the end of the year now looks doubtful, andtime is running out for Mrs. Thatcher's government to find asolution before an election is required in mid-1992.   Inflation has risen steadily even though economic growth hasdeclined since Mrs. Thatcher won her third consecutive five-yearterm in June 1987.   The government's chosen cure has become as painful as inflation.With interest rates at 15 percent for a year, the number of houserepossessions has doubled since the second half of 1989.   The problems started when the government lowered interest ratesin 1988 to prevent a recession after the October 1987 stock marketcrash.   This year's inflation outlook will remain clouded by the Mideastcrisis, although economists say the world's economies are betterprepared to handle oil shocks than they were in the 1970s.   The current problems contrast with the mid-1980s, when Britainwas enjoying a sustained economic boom and Mrs. Thatcher wascredited with curing Britain's economic disease.   Inflation, which had crested at 21.9 percent during a recessionin May 1980, had dropped to a 20-year low of 2.4 percent in July1986.   Now the socialist Labor Party considers itself justified incriticizing the government's economic policies. Labor had beenwidely blamed for soaring inflation, high interest rates andmilitant unionism in the 1970s.   In August 1975, under a Labor government, inflation peaked at26.9 percent.   On Friday, Labor spokesman Smith blamed the current rise ininflation on the goernment's ``massively incompetent economicmismanagement.''   Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major conceded in radiointerviews that Britain's inflation was a ``good deal higher thanwe would wish to see it'' but maintained that inflation was not``out of control.''   Although some economists and businessmen fear continued highinterest rates will tip Britain into a recession, Major reiteratedhis commitment to holding interest rates high until he feelsinflation is defeated.   Major declined to say when inflation might peak and wheninterest rates might come down.</TEXT></DOC>
