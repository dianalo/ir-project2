An American official and an Iranian official at the Iran-UnitedStates Claims Tribunal in The Hague told The Associated Press thesettlement will speed resolution of the big cases.   Settlement of the major cases could help re-establish economicrelations between the two nations, the American official said.   The Iranian official denied, however, that better U.S.-Iraneconomic ties would result.   ``The economic relationship depends on the politicalrelationship,'' he said. ``If you don't have a good relationship inthe political sector, how can you have a good relationship in theeconomic sector?''   Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity.   Government-to-government talks are expected to begin soon onsettlement of the Foreign Military Sales, or FMS, claim by Iran,which the Tehran government has put at about $11 billion.   The largest case before the tribunal, it deals with militarysupplies ordered by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi before his overthrowin the 1979 Islamic revolution.   Washington disputes Tehran's figure as exaggerated, claimingthat while some of the materiel is under U.S. embargo, much of itwas never paid for and is being held by U.S. contractors.   The American official said once small claims are settled, thetribunal will have more time for military equipment and oil claims.   The nine-judge arbitration panel was established as part of the1980 Algiers Accords, which gained freedom for the 52 Americansheld hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by Iranian militants.   The tribunal has presided over the settlement of more than $2.2billion in financial disputes stemming from the Iranian revolution,resulting expropriations and broken contracts.   The oil expropriation claims, filed by the American oil giantsAmoco, Arco and Sun, and by consortiums of smaller firms, totalabout $5 billion.   ``A key to their (Iran's) economic recovery is settling all ofthem,'' the American official said.   ``Settlement of these cases, particularly if they entailed asoftening of U.S. import restrictions on Iranian oil, would reflectand accelerate a thawing.''   A reopening of the U.S. oil market to Iran is considered vitalto the Iranians, who depend on oil exports for about 90 percent oftheir foreign exchange earnings.   ``They're desperate for hard currency,'' said the Americanofficial.   The small claims talks have been held almost monthly between theState Department's chief legal adviser, Judge Abraham Sofaer, andIran's Jaromi Eftekhar.   Sofaer is due to resign from his State Department position nextmonth and the American tribunal official said Sofaer is expected tobegin settlement talks before then with Iran on the FMS claim,known as B1.   ``Without the small claims, the tribunal will have moreresources to devote to B1 and the oil claims,'' said the American.   A more speculative question is whether resolution of themilitary equipment and oil cases could provide the goodwill gesturesought by Tehran in response to the recent release of Americanhostages Robert Polhill and Frank Reed, who were held bypro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants in Lebanon.   The American official and Iran have denied any link betweenagreement on small claims and the release.   Resolution of the FMS and oil cases would allow the Tribunal toshut down after almost a decade as the only official forum betweenIran and the United States, which broke off diplomatic relationsfollowing the 1979 hostage-taking.   ``If we do all the things necessary to close it down, doors willhave been opened in the process,'' said the American tribunalofficial.   ``It would result in improved good will.''</TEXT></DOC>
