Col. Oliver North participated in the scheme.    Mr. Channell is the first figure in the Iran-Contra scandal to have criminal charges brought against him. But his courtroom allegation concerning Col. North, combined with comments by criminal investigators, indicate that independent counsel Lawrence Walsh is attempting to build a broader conspiracy case -- partly by relying on cooperation from Mr. Channell and three employees of the fund-raiser who weren't identified.    Mr. Channell met regularly with Col. North and once received a letter from President Reagan praising his efforts to solicit private money to help Nicaraguan rebels known as the Contras. When U.S. District Judge Stanley Harris yesterday asked him in court to identify other participants in the conspiracy, Mr. Channell replied, &quot;Col. North, an official of the National Security Council.&quot; He also named conservative publicist Richard Miller.    Col. North has declined to respond to questions, and his attorney couldn't be reached for comment. The Associated Press quoted Mr. Miller as saying, &quot;I categorically deny that I have conspired with Mr. Channell or anyone else&quot; for any illegal purpose. &quot;I am confident that when the entire story has been revealed, in or out of court, my conduct will be vindicated.&quot;    In a one-count felony information filed in federal district court here, Mr. Walsh charged Mr. Channell with &quot;subverting and corrupting&quot; the tax-exempt status of his organization, the National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty. Starting in April 1985, prosecutors said, Mr. Channell solicited contributions for military aid to the Contras, telling potential donors the money was earmarked for weapons and would be tax-deductible although he &quot;knew that it was improper&quot; to claim that tax status.    The court documents list a series of meetings around the country in 1985 and 1986 at which Mr. Channel visited with potential or actual contributors -- four times in the company of a government official who wasn't identified. But law enforcement officials later said Col. North was the official mentioned in the court documents.    Jared Cameron, a spokesman for Mr. Channell said, &quot;This has been a difficult time for Mr. Channell and his staff.&quot; In a prepared statement, Mr. Cameron said the fund-raiser is &quot;cooperating fully&quot; with the independent counsel, and &quot;hopes his cooperation will relieve the burdens that have been placed on him and others who, like himself, were drawn into these issues by the belief in the need for freedom and Democracy in Central America.&quot;    Mr. Channell faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He was released without bail, but Judge Harris ordered him to surrender his passport.    Mr. Walsh has been criticized by some lawmakers for moving too slowly and for demanding that Congress delay granting Col. North and other major witnesses immunity from prosecution. He called Mr. Channell's guilty plea &quot;a significant step forward&quot; in his inquiry.    Yesterday was the first time Col. North was accused in courtroom testimony of participating in illegal activities. Mr. Walsh and his aides, however, declined to comment on whether they intend to file charges against the former aide.    Mr. Channell named Col. North in open court as part of his plea agreement with the special prosecutor, individuals familiar with Mr. Walsh's investigation said. The prosecutor's strategy was to show that he is making progress with his inquiry, and to encourage other potential targets of the probe to cooperate, the sources said.    The fact that Mr. Channell identified only two participants in the scheme -- Col. North and the publicist, Mr. Miller -- &quot;of course doesn't preclude that there may have been others,&quot; David Zornow, one of Mr. Walsh's prosecutors, told reporters after the hearing.    Law enforcement officials said Mr. Walsh also has been investigating whether Mr. Channell, or leaders of other pro-Contra groups, may have violated federal laws barring U.S. citizens from participating in foreign military conflicts. Although the terms of their plea agreements weren't disclosed, Mr. Channell and his three employees now presumably can't be prosecuted under such laws. But the guilty plea doesn't resolve the issue for other potential defendants, according to law enforcement officials.    Established only three years ago, Mr. Channell's National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty raised $4.2 million in 1985 and an estimated $7.1 million in 1986, according to a recent audit released by the fund-raiser. Mr. Miller's firm, International Business Communications, was a major conduit for the distribution of these funds -- including more than $1.7 million funneled in 1985 and 1986 to a Swiss account linked to Col. North. Intel Co-Operation, a Caymans Islands corporation believed to be controlled by Mr. Miller, frequently assisted in making these transfers to Geneva.    While no details were given yesterday as to the nature of the military aid that was provided as a result of the endowment's donations, the flow of the funds to Switzerland in late 1985 and 1986 coincided with Col. North's successful efforts to begin a private airlift to carry supplies and arms to guerrillas inside Nicaragua.    For example, records show that $450,000 was moved to Panama from Switzerland in mid-November 1985 for the purpose of buying planes used in the airlift. The payment was arranged by Cie. des Services Fiduciares, a Geneva financial services firm used by Col. North's private netowrk, and it followed deposits from Mr. Channell's organization into the Swiss account linked to the fired aide. </TEXT></DOC>
