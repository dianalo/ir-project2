This proposal is based on EPA's conclusion that these additionalmeasures will strengthen the maintenance demonstration of the CO standardconsistent with the ten-year maintenance period described in EPA's November24, 1987 (52 FR 45044) proposal on post-1987 ozone/CO planning.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be submitted to EPA at the address below bySeptember 9, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments on this proposal should be sent to: RegionalAdministrator, Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, 215 Fremont Street,San Francisco, CA 94105, Attn: State Liaison Section, A-2-2, Air ManagementDivision.Copies of the submitted plan and EPA's technical support document (TSD)are available for public inspection during normal working hours at thefollowing addresses:<ITAG tagnum="15">Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, 215 Fremont Street, SanFrancisco, CA 94105, State Liaison Section (A-2-2), Air Management Division</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Air Quality,2005 North Central Avenue, 6th Floor, Phoenix, AZ 85004</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Pima Association of Governments, 177 North Church Street, 4th Floor,Tucson, AZ 85701</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Wallace Woo, Chief, State LiaisonSection, (A-2-2), Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, 215 FremontStreet, San Francisco, CA 94105, (415) 974-7634, FTS: 454-7634</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background  </ITAG>In a separate section of today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, EPA is taking final action to approve SIP revisionsthat provide for attainment of the carbon monoxide standard in Pima Countyin 1990 and maintenance of that standard through 1998. EPA is proposingin this notice to approve the recently passed State oxygenated fuels programand the locally-adopted travel reduction ordinances as additional measuresin the Pima CO SIP. Although these new measures will not by themselvesbe sufficient to advance the 1990 attainment date, they will provide extraassurances that Pima County will attain the CO standard in 1990 and maintainit thereafter. The demonstration of maintenance is consistent with theten-year period described in EPA's November 24, 1987 proposal on post-1987ozone/CO planning. Projections of maintenance beyond ten years would betoo speculative to be reliable.  The measures that EPA is proposing to approve today will also serve thefunction of a contingency provision EPA might otherwise require to insurethat additional reductions would be forthcoming in the event of unanticipatedshortfalls in planned emission reductions. In its original guidance onpreparation of SIPS for areas receiving attainment date extensions to 1987,EPA called for such contingency provisions as a component of an approvableattainment demonstration. See 46 FR 7182 (January 22, 1981). EPA subsequentlyindicated that areas such as Pima County that had not obtained an attainmentdate extension but failed to attain by 1982 would generally have to meetall of the requirements for extension areas in order to demonstrate timelyattainment. See Guidance Document for Correction of Part D SIPs for NonattainmentAreas, January 27, 1984. The measures in today's proposal have alreadybeen adopted and will provide significant additional emission reductionsbeyond in the CO SIP that EPA is approving elsewhere in this <T4>Federal Register</T4>. These additional reductions will be availableto compensate for any unanticipated shortfalls in planned emission reductionsand will thus serve the purpose of the contingency provisions EPA contemplatedin 1981.  <ITAG tagnum="84">II. EPA Evaluation  </ITAG>Travel Reduction Ordinances  In March and April 1988, all five jurisdictions in the Pima County nonattainmentarea (Pima County, Tucson, South Tucson, Marana, and Oro Valley) individuallyadopted the travel reduction ordinance (TRO) developed by the Pima Associationof Governments (PAG). Authority for local jurisdictions to adopt and enforceTROs was provided in S.B. 1360 and reconfirmed in H.B. 2206. In additionto adopting the TRO, each of the five jurisdictions signed an intergovernmentalagreement (IGA) to jointly implement the individual ordinances throughPAG. The State submitted the adopted TRO and IGA to EPA as a revision tothe Pima County portion of the Arizona Carbon Monoxide SIP on May 26, 1988. The model TRO requires all employers of 100 or more fulltime equivalentemployees at a worksite to distribute information on alternative transportationmodes to their employees, participate in surveys of the alternative-modesusage of their employees, and develop a travel reduction plan. The travelreduction goals in the ordinance are a 15 percent employee participationrate in the first year of the regional program, 20 percent in the second,25 percent in the third, and additional 1 percent increases in the participationrate in each of subsequent years until a 40 percent participation rateis achieved. Alternatively, after a 25 percent employees participationrate is achieved, an employer can demonstrate an annual reduction of 1.5percent in the average annual vehicle miles traveled per employee.  Under the IGA, the TRO will be implemented by the Pima Assocation of Governments.While a committee within PAG will recommend enforcement actions, actualenforcement powers are retained by the individual jurisdictions. All partiesto the IGA have agreed to fund the travel reduction program at PAG andhave already allocated funds for the program's first six months. In addition,the 1988 Air Quality Legislation (H.B. 2206) passed by the Arizona Legislationin June 1988, requires the Director of the Department of EnvironmentalQuality to grant funds from the Air Quality Fund to local jurisdictionsor regional planning agencies to implement TROs.  Additional details on the TRO and IGA can be found in the technical supportdocument (TSD) for this notice.  Oxygenated Fuels Program  H.B. 2206 establishes an oxygenated fuels program for the CO nonattainmentarea of Pima County. The program is composed of three basic parts. First,a new section 41-2125 A of the Arizona Revised Statutes sets the requiredoxygen content of leaded or unleaded gasoline at 1.8 to 3.7 percent byweight. This requirement applies from and after September 30 through March31, beginning in the Fall of 1990. Second, a new section 41-2125 B of theArizona Revised Statutes advances the effective date of the Pima Countyrequirement by one year (to start in the Fall of 1989), if a CO exceedanceoccurs between October 1988 and March 1989, or if the Pima County Boardof Supervisors and Tucson City Council join in adopting the earlier effectivedate by March 31, 1989. Third, and finally, new sections 28-2701 through28-2708 of the Arizona Revised Statutes enable the Governor to implementa State set-aside program that effectively insures the availability ofgasoline suitable for blending with alcohol, if the Department of Transportationdetermines a shortage of such unblended gasoline exists for compliancewith the mandatory oxygenated fuels period.  Of the above three elements, EPA can grant CO emission reduction creditsonly to the requirements of the new section 41-2125 A. The possibilityof advancing the effective date of the program is not a maintenance relatedissue, and is not pertinent to this proposal. The set-aside authority ofsections 28-2701 through 28-2708 would, if exercised, make it possiblefor more fuel to be blended to higher oxygen levels associated with alcohol-basedblends than might otherwise be the case with other gasoline blends, butthe Governor has discretion to declare a shortage and order the set-asideprogram into operation. Even if ordered, EPA has received no informationwith which to estimate the degree of ethanol blending during the entirecompliance period, as discussed further below.  Before presenting EPA's analysis of the Pima County program, it shouldbe noted that a detailed description of oxygenated fuels and their effecton motor vehicle emissions is contained in EPA's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(NPRM) on the Maricopa Federal Implementation Plan (FIP), of May 16, 1988(53 FR 17378). Also, the methodology and assumptions for evaluating theCO effects of the oxygen content limits specified in section 41-2125 Awere prososed at 17410 of that same <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice and clarified by a memo from Phil Lorang,Office of Mobile Sources, EPA, to Wallace Woo, EPA Region 9 (June 22, 1988).The details of this methodology are contained in the draft technical supportdocument for this action, and will not be repeated here. The interestedreader is instead referred to that document. However, the basic elementsof EPA's evaluation are briefly described below.The EPA report, ``Guidance on Estimating Motor Vehicle Emission ReductionsFrom the Use of Alternative Fuels and Fuel Blends,'' January 29, 1988,EPA-AS-TSS-PA-87-4, is the basis for the calculation of CO emission reductions.The guidance in this report is supplemented with the following informationand assumptions. For any grade of gasoline for which the minimum oxygencontent is 1.8 percent by weight, EPA will assume that all fuel sold ofthat grade is on average 1.9 percent oxygen (or 10.45 percent MTBE by volume).This assumption is based on the plan for implementation of H.R. 2206 containedin the addendum to the Maricopa County CO plan which indicates an intentby the Department of Weights and Measures to allow no enforcement tolerancefor oxygen content, so that refiners must blend to a slightly higher oxygenlevel to allow for measurement variability. Additionally, no ethanol blendsare currently marketed in Pima County and no major oil company, other sizablegasoline marketer, or other investor indicated in comments on EPA's NPRMfor Maricopa that it will definitely purchase and import via pipeline ortruck transport oxygen-free gasoline for resale to distributors for usein ethanol blending. Therefore, EPA is assuming that no ethanol blendswill be sold in Pima County. Further, the workplan referred to above alsocontains a commitment by the Arizona Department of Weights and Measuresto enforce the oxygenated fuels requirements and H.B. 2206 appropriatesresources to the Department for this purpose.   Given the information and assumptions delineated above, EPA is assumingthat all fuel sold in the Pima County nonattainment area will contain alevel of MTBE which produces 1.9 percent oxygen by weight, i.e., about10.45 percent MTBE by volume depending on the density of individual batchesof gasoline used in blending. These assumptions result in a fleet CO emissionreduction on December 31, 1991, of 12.83 percent.   The actual CO reduction in Pima County may be higher, but not assuredlyso. If ethanol blends are marketed in the area, the 3.4 to 3.7 percentoxygen by weight that is normally associated with the gasoline would providegreater benefits than the 1.9 percent oxygen by weight assumed by EPA forMTBE blends. Also, some or all of the leaded fuel supplied to Tucson throughthe pipeline from Texas refineries may be blended with MTBE to comply withthe higher oxygen levels applicable to the Phoenix area under the provisionsof H.B. 2206. However, EPA has no assurance that either of these eventswill occur and thus can not assign emission reduction credit to eithermeasure.   EPA believes that Arizona is authorized under the Clean Air Act to prescribeand enforce the oxygenated fuels program proposed for approval today. Asfully explained in the May 16, 1988 NPRM at 17412-3, EPA interprets section211(c)(4)(A) to allow state regulation of motor vehicle fuels or fuel additivesunless there has been federal pre-emption. Under section 211(c)(4)(A) pre-emptionof state regulation of a fuel occurs (i) if EPA has found that no fuelrelated control or prohibition is necessary for that fuel or additive andhas published such finding in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>or (ii) if EPA has prescribed by regulationunder section 211(c)(1) a control or prohibition applicable to the fuelor fuel-additive regulated by the state that is different from the statecontrol or prohibition. The Agency wants to stress that it does not believethat either form of pre-emption has occurred in this case.   First, EPA has not made the finding that no fuel-related control or prohibitionis necessary; and clearly has not published any such finding in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.   Second, EPA does not believe that it has prescribed the type of fuel controlcontemplated in section 211(c)(4)(A)(ii). EPA believes the reference inthat section to ``a control or prohibition applicable to such fuel or fueladditive'' prescribed by the Administrator was intended to include onlythe same type of fuel control that the regulation in question is attemptingto prescribe. Under this approach, section 211(c)(4)(A)'s prohibition ofthe adoption of a particular type of fuel control would be triggered onlyif EPA had already prescribed, by regulation under section 211(c)(1), thesame type of fuel control as at issue in the case at hand_in this casecontrols on the oxygen content of fuels. Since EPA has not prescribed anycontrol on the oxygen content of any fuel by section 211(c) rule making,\1\<NOTE/>the Agency believes that the pre-emption described in section211(c)(4)(A)(ii) has not occurred and that Arizona is free to adopt isown oxygen content controls and EPA is free to approve a SIP which includessuch controls. Under these circumstances, EPA may approve such controlswithout making the special finding described in section 211(c)(4)(C) ofthe Act. Section 211(c)(4)(C) allows, where pre-emption has occurred, statefuel-related controls to be approved into a SIP if EPA finds such controlsare ``necessary'' to achieve the standard the SIP implements. In this casea finding under section 211(c)(4)(C) is not required because pre-emptionhas not occurred.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\EPA has established limits on oxygen content for certainnew fuels that have been granted waivers under section 211(f) of the Actfor introduction into commerce, but has taken no such action under section211(c).   <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Summary of Proposed Action   </ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve the oxygenated fuels program provision of ArizonaHouse Bill 2206 as a revision to the Pima County portion of the ArizonaCarbon Monoxide SIP. EPA is also proposing to approve as revisions to theSIP the travel reduction ordinances adopted by five local jurisdictionsin Pima County as well as the intergovernmental agreement signed by thesejurisdictions to implement the ordinances. Although these measures arenot essential for the State to demonstrate attainment and maintenance ofthe CO standard in Pima County, EPA is making this proposal because thesemeasures both strengthen the SIP and serve as contingency measures.   <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Process   </ITAG>The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.   Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.Final approval of these SIP revisions would merely approve requirementsthat the State has already adopted (See 46 FR 8706).   <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52   </ITAG>Air pollution control, Carbon monoxide, Intergovernmental relations. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 7401-7642. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: August 3, 1988.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Daniel W.
