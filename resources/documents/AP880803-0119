But volcanoes pose far less threat to ozone than man-madechemicals called chlorofluorocarbons do, said researcher WilliamRose.   The ozone layer in the stratosphere blocks ultraviolet radiationfrom the sun that can cause skin cancer. Destruction of ozone bychlorofluorocarbons has caused worldwide concern, leading to atreaty signed recently by two dozen countries to curtail emissions.   The new study is presented in Thursday's issue of the Britishjournal Nature by Rose and Robert Symonds of Michigan TechnologicalUniversity in Houghton, with Mark Reed at the University of Oregonin Eugene.   They estimated concentrations of various gases from pastvolcanic eruptions and used the results to project annual worldwidetotals.   On average, volcanoes release a total of up to 15.4 million tonsof hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride to the atmosphere ayear, but less than a tenth reaches the stratosphere, theycalculated.   Gases from cataclysmic volcanic eruptions can rise more than 15miles high, so they should encounter the maximum concentration ofozone at about 15 miles, they wrote. But more work is needed totell just what such eruptions actually do to the ozone, they said.</TEXT></DOC>
