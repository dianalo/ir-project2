(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The extra 400 cars a day being produced bya second shift at Toyota Motor Corp.'s main assembly plant maydouble annual production and still not meet customer requests,company officials said.   ``We've had a problem meeting the market's demand for Camrys,''said Alex Warren, senior vice president of administration for Toyota.   The Camry is one of the top-selling cars in the United States.Last year, more than 200,000 were sold here. This year, Toyotaexpects sales of 250,000 to 260,000, Warren said.   As of June, Toyota had only enough cars in inventory to sell for23 days, said Debra Sanchez Fair, a spokeswoman for Toyota MotorSales U.S.A. in Torrence, Calif. The industry standard for normalinventory is 60 days.   ``The Camry is our No. 1 volume vehicle,'' she said. And June wasa record month, despite a slowdown in the auto industry.   By year end, Toyota management expects the Georgetown plant tomake 800 cars a day _ 200,000 a year. This past week, the firstshift was producing 400 a day while the second shift was making 275.   Warren said there is no specific timetable for the acceleration.   ``We're not as worried about the numbers as we are the quality,''he said.   Hiring at the plant is complete, and the new employees trainedwith the first shift through May and early June. Slowly, the hoursfor the second shift were changed so the workers could spend sometime working on their own each day. In mid-June, the two shifts werecompletely split.   The first shift works from 6:15 a.m. to 3:15 p.m. The secondshift works from 5:15 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. Hiring for the second shiftbegan in January and ended two weeks ago.   The plant now employs between 2,800 and 2,900, with about 1,250workers on the line for each shift, Warren said.   Hiring for the power-train plant _ where engines, axles andsteering components will be assembled _ will continue through theend of 1990. By then, the two plants could employ as many as 3,500,Warren said. The power-train plant is scheduled to be completed bynext summer.</TEXT></DOC>
