(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A blind man had his guide dog onhand while his wife gave birth after hospital officials agreed to acompromise between the needs of the dog and the baby.   Brad Schuler, 23, and his Seeing Eye dog, Theo, were in acritical stage of the dog's training Aug. 14 when Schuler's wife,Teresa, went into labor. Schuler had told officials at TraverseCity Osteopathic Hospital that he couldn't be separated from the70-pound Labrador retriever and asked to bring him into thedelivery room.   Schuler said that because he and the dog had been together forjust a month, a separation could have made the dog distraught andundone 18 months of training.   But federal law prohibits dogs, even Seeing Eye dogs, fromdelivery rooms.   After consulting with state and federal health officials andcolleagues at more than 20 other hospitals, officials decided tolet Theo watch the couple from the bathroom while Mrs. Schuler layin labor for six hours until giving birth to a baby girl, Stephanie.   The dog ``handled it real well,'' Schuler said. ``He was aprofessional.''   ``I had my reservations,'' said Julie Dixon, who delivered theinfant. ``But it went very smoothly. I don't know if Brad couldhave been there (otherwise) because he needed to be with his dog.That is a heck of a choice to have to make.''</TEXT></DOC>
