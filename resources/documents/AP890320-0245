Penguins calmly perch atop the overturned vessel, unaware of thedanger in thin oily sheen in the water around them. Most of the tensof thousands of gallons of diesel fuel that spilled out in theshipwreck Jan. 28 has since evaporated, but more is slowly leaking.   Times are changing at Earth's last frontier.   Countries eager to stake or reinforce their claims to a slice ofthe Frozen Continent are dispatching ships and aircraft, bulldozersand amphibious trucks. With nationalistic fanfare, they are buildingnew bases and launching new research projects.   During the austral summer, well-heeled tourists arrive by thehundreds each week on cruise ships, supply vessels or militarytransport planes contracted by specilized travel agencies. Evenprivate yachts and polar skiing expeditions are venturing into thelast place on Earth where no passport is needed.   Accidents are happening, and in the case of the Bahia ParaisoAntarctic wildlife paid the price. A host of legal, environmentaland highly political questions are surging up like the hazardousicebergs in Antarctica's poorly charted seas.   ``You're confronted daily with an ever-hastening chain ofevents,'' Peter Wilkniss, polar programs chief for theWashington-based National Science Foundation, told a visitingAssociated Press correspondent at Palmer Station. The foundationdirects all U.S. research in Antarctica.   Wilkniss advocates increased international regulation.   ``There's nothing that prevents anyone from doing anything theywant,'' he said. ``I don't think we can live with that situation.''   He described the continent's 5.1 million square miles as ``ajudicial no-man's land.''   No laws apply to Antarctica because no one owns it, according tothe terms of the Antarctic Treaty. The pact was signed in 1961 by 12countries who agreed to put all territorial claims on hold for atleast 30 years and reserve Antarctica for peaceful research.   Eight other nations since have joined the treaty with full votingpowers, while an additional 18 have agreed to abide by itsprovisions and hold observer status. The treaty nations meet aboutevery two years.   The organization recently drafted a plan to permit strictlyregulated exploration and exploitation of the continent's mineralresources after 1991, when the treaty itself is up for review.   But it is only beginning to grapple with such issues as theproliferation of bases, marine and air safety, indemnification, andmedical and rescue facilities.   The wreck of the Bahia Paraiso exemplifies the region'spredicament.   The 435-foot supply and research vessel, operated by theArgentine navy, called on Palmer Station in glacier-rimmed ArthurBay on Jan. 28 so the 81 tourists on board could take a look around.It also carried a crew of 235.   On its way out of the bay, it ran aground in a passage marked onsea charts as containing ``danger ledges and pinnacles.'' Crew andpassengers got off safely in lifeboats and found shelter at thestation.   The ship, over a period of four days, gradually rolled over andsank. About 180,000 gallons of diesel oil from its storage tanksspilled into the water.   During the austral summer season, more than 30 cruises werescheduled to call on Palmer, bringing an average 100 tourists oneach occasion.   Tourism is uncontrolled and, to some, out of control.   ``In 1982, we got three cruise ships all season,'' said BruceCarter of ITT-Antarctic Services, which is contracted to supply andmaintain Palmer Station. ``This year we got as many as five a week.We'd sometimes get two in one day.''   The Science Foundation briefly tried to ban tourist visits lastyear, arguing that it interfered with research. But the ban waslifted when influential Americans complained, claiming a right tosee how their tax dollars are being spent. The Bahia Paraiso'stourists included 46 Americans who paid from $3,000 to nearly $7,000for the cruise.   The station's staff includes a medical corpsman with a smallone-room clinic for treating the two to four dozen people at thebase. It is not designed for handling a maritime disaster.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
