<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-28-1084 </DOCNO><TEXT>The stereochemical course of the phospho group transfer catalyzed by mutant(S102C) alkaline phosphatase from Escherichia coli was investigated byusing {sup 31}P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Transphosphorylationfrom 4-nitrophenyl (R/sub P/)-{sup 17}O, {sup 16}O, {sup 18}O]phosphateto (S)-propane-1,2-diol occurs with overall retention of configurationat phosphorus. This result is consistent with the view that the hydrolysisof substrates by this mutant enzyme proceeds by way of a covalent phosphoenzymeintermediate in the same manner as the wild-type alkaline phosphatase.</TEXT></DOC>
