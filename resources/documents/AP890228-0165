In a report released Tuesday, the leaders said Britain isencouraging South Africa to believe change is not urgent.   ``Apartheid will simply reform, adapt and survive,'' it said toBritain's policy of ``mild diplomatic pressure and waiting foreconomic growth.''   The report was drawn up by the British Council of Churches, themain representative body of Christian churches in Britain, and avoluntary organization, Christian Aid.   British exports to South Africa, official figures show, rose bynearly 20 percent to $1.4 billion in the first nine months of lastyear, compared with the same period in 1987.   Britain is South Africa's third-largest trading partner, behindJapan and West Germany.   The report said Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's governmentlargely stuck to the letter of 15 relatively mild sanctions _ranging from a longtime ban on arms sales to a ``voluntary ban'' onpromoting tourism, but not the spirit.   ``The message brought home to the South African government is notthat change is urgently needed, but that Britain regards thesemeasures lightly,'' said the report.   Mrs. Thatcher argues her policy increased British influence forchange in South Africa. She says sanctions would hurt South Africanblacks most, harden white resistance to change, be circumvented andcost jobs in Britain.   The church report said the British government encouraged tradewith South Africa.   ``There have been computer and radar sales which could be of useto the military,'' it said.   ``The voluntary ban on the promotion of tourism (agreed inmid-1986) appears to have been carried out only through the dispatchof two letters to tourist federations, and is not monitored by thegovernment.   ``British Airways heavily advertises its South African flights,including a link to the United States of America which replaces thedirect flights banned by the U.S. Congress.''</TEXT></DOC>
