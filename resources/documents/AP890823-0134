Rebuffed by a U.S. District Court judge on Tuesday, thefederation asked the U.S. Court of Appeals to reinstate a law thatrequires shrimpers to use devices that let turtles escape from theirnets.   The federation sought an emergency injunction to ``ensure thecontinued survival of the severely endangered Kemp's ridley seaturtle and four other sea turtle species listed as threatened orendangered.''   The federation is challenging Commerce Secretary RobertMosbacher's decision allowing shrimpers to limit trawling time to105 minutes in lieu of turtle excluder devices, or TEDs.   Under the 105-minute limit, shrimpers can have their nets in thewater for 90 minutes, the length of time some officials claim a seaturtle can survive while submerged. The regulations give shrimpersanother 7{ minutes to get their nets in the water and 7{ minutes toremove them.   Mosbacher suspended enforcement of the TEDs regulations July 24,after a weekend of protests by shrimpers who claim the devicesreduce their catch and threaten their livelihood.   ``According to the biological opinion of the secretary's ownscientists, the substitution of a limited tow time for required TEDuse in the midst of the shrimping season will result in the deathsof thousands of threatened and endangered sea turtles in the Gulfand the Atlantic,'' the federation said in its appeal.   The temporary regulations, drafted under a court order by U.S.District Judge Thomas Hogan, are in effect through Sept. 8, whenMosbacher must issue final rules.   Mosbacher issued the temporary regulations after the wildlifefederation filed suit and Hogan ruled the turtles were being lefttotally unprotected.   But federation claims that National Marine Fisheries Servicescientists have concluded the 105-minute plan ``will jeopardize thecontinued existence of five threatened and endangered species of seaturtles.''   Commerce spokesman Brian Gorman said the final rules due outSept. 8 are still under consideration.</TEXT></DOC>
