It took Frank A. Olson, the company's new chairman and chief executive officer, less than a minute to scrap it.    One of Mr. Olson's first recommendations Tuesday night was to erase the controversial six-week-old corporate logo. In its place he said he will ask shareholders to approve a new name, one that sat at the top of the company's stationery for 43 years -- United Airlines Inc.    Mr. Olson thereby joins a host of Allegis critics -- critics of the name, not necessarily the company. New York City developer and sometime Allegis shareholder Donald Trump likened the logo to &quot;the next world-class disease.&quot; Others were equally disparaging. The company's stock slid nearly 9% after it announced it was dropping UAL Inc., the corporate logo since 1969, for Allegis.    An Allegis spokesman declined to speculate yesterday on Mr. Olson's motives. But he noted that even the company's pilots took potshots at the name. &quot;You can draw your own assumptions,&quot; he said.    But Clive Chajet, head of Lippincott andamp; Margulies, the New York City consultant that came up with Allegis, says his firm's &quot;identity concept&quot; worked. &quot;We were asked to develop a communications strategy to emphasize the company's value,&quot; Mr. Chajet said. &quot;We did it. The stock went from 47 to 90.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
