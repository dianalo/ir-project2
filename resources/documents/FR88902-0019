This section was added to the Codeby section 1241 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-514, 100 Stat.2085, 2576). <ITAG tagnum="84">Need for Temporary Regulations </ITAG>The proper application of section 884 is dependent upon the Internal RevenueService's detailed specifications of the manner in which the requirementsof the statute will be administered. These regulations are necessary toprovide taxpayers with immediate guidance in the application of section884, as added to the Code by section 1241 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986(Pub. L. 99-514, 100 Stat. 2085, 2576). <ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Provisions </ITAG>Branch Profits Tax Section 1.884-1T(b) provides rules for computing the dividend equivalentamount, the base on which the branch profits tax is imposed. The dividendequivalent amount is a foreign corporation's effectively connected earningsand profits for the taxable year reduced by any increase in U.S. net equityduring the taxable year or increased by any decrease in U.S. net equityduring the taxable year. An increase in U.S. net equity is treated as areinvestment of effectively connected earnings and profits in a U.S. tradeor business and a decrease in U.S. net equity is generally treated as adisinvestment of effectively connected earnings and profits accumulatedin prior years. However, an increase in the dividend equivalent amountis limited to post-1986 effectively connected earnings and profits of aforeign corporation that have not been previously subject to the branchprofits tax (non-previously taxed accumulated effectively connected earningsand profits). Section 1.884-1T(c) defines the term ``U.S. net equity'' as a foreign corporation'sU.S. assets reduced by its U.S. liabilities. Under andSection; 1.884-1T(d), property is a U.S. asset if all of the incomefrom its use and all the gain from its disposition on the date on whicha determination is made (if used or sold at a gain on that determinationdate), would be income that is effectively connected with the conduct ofa U.S. trade or business. Rules are given for specific types of property,such as depreciable property, inventory, U.S. real property interests,and partnership interests. The amount taken into account as a U.S. assetwith respect to property is the adjusted basis of the property for purposesof computing earnings and profits. Section 1.884-1T(d)(11) provides that a foreign corporation may elect totreat a limited amount of marketable securities as U.S. assets. The purposeof this election is to provide relief from the requirement that effectivelyconnected earnings and profits be reinvested as of the close of the year.Income from the securities is treated as effectively connected with theconduct of a U.S. trade or business. Section 1.884-1T(d)(13) enumerates certain types of property that are nottreated as U.S. assets even though the property would otherwise qualifyas U.S. assets under andSection; 1.884-1T(d). Such property includes propertythat produces income that is effectively connected with the conduct ofa U.S. trade or business but does not produce effectively connected earningsand profits, and property that is acquired or used to artificially increaseU.S. net equity. Under andSection; 1.884-1T(e), ``U.S. liabilities'' are determined on thebasis of fungibility, <T3>i.e., </T3>as the product of a foreign corporation's U.S. assets atthe close of the taxable year and either the ratio of the foreign corporation'sworldwide liabilities at the close of the taxable year to its worldwideassets at the close of the taxable year or, if the foreign corporationcomputes its interest deduction using a fixed ratio of liabilities to assetsunder andSection; 1.882-5(b)(2)(i), the fixed ratio. A special rule is providedfor computing the liabilities of a foreign corporation that is a partnerin a partnership. Under an anti-abuse rule, an artificial decrease in theU.S. liabilities of the foreign corporation is disregarded. As an alternative to fungibility, a booking method was considered for determiningU.S. liabilities. However, the regulations adopt the fungibility approachfor several reasons. First, section 884(c)(2)(C) provides that the regulationsdefining U.S. liabilities shall be consistent with the allocation of deductionsunder section 882(c)(1). Second, fungibility is, in general, more consistentwith the principles of the branch profits tax. Because U.S. assets aregenerally defined as assets that produce effectively connected earningsand profits, which is the base for the branch profits tax, the regulationsdefine U.S. liabilities as liabilities that produce deductions that reduceeffectively connected earnings and profits.Under the regulations, a foreign corporation's U.S. liabilities may shiftas a function of the amount of profits generated by its U.S. assets relativeto the profits generated by its foreign assets. Thus, if the U.S. assetshave a higher profit rate than the foreign assets, the U.S. assets willattract more liabilities than the foreign assets. In such a case, U.S.net equity may not increase sufficiently to reduce the divided equivalentamount to zero even though all the current earnings remain invested inthe U.S. trade or business. On the other hand, if the foreign assets havea higher profit rate than the U.S. assets, a corporation may not have adividend equivalent amount even though it repatriates some of its currentearnings. These results occur because the regulations view liabilitiesas fungible, <T3>i.e., </T3>as supporting all the assets of the foreign corporation.If U.S. assets increase relative to foreign assets, the U.S. trade or businesswould  be treated as assuming a larger share of the foreign corporation'sworldwide liabilities. If the U.S. trade or business were conducted ina separate domestic subsidiary, such assumption would be treated as a dividenddistribution by the subsidiary to its foreign parent to the extent of theliabilities assumed. If the U.S. trade or business is conducted in a branch,the assumption of additional liabilities by the branch will reduce U.S.net equity and give rise to a dividend equivalent amount. Similarly, ifforeign assets increase relative to U.S. assets, the foreign operationscan be viewed as assuming a larger share of the corporation's worldwideliabilities. In that case the assumption is equivalent to a capital contributionto the U.S. trade or business, and results in an increase in U.S. net equity.Section 1.884-1T(f)(1) defines the term ``effectively connected earningsand profits'' to mean earnings and profits attributable to income thatis effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business.The regulations do not reflect the amendment in H.R. 4333, S. 2238, 100thCong., 2d Sess. (hereinafter the ``technical corrections bill'') dealingwith certain unearned premium reserves. Section 1.884-1T(f)(2) enumerates certain types of effectively connectedincome that do not produce effectively connected earnings and profits.This income includes certain income derived from the operation of shipsor aircraft that is excluded from gross income under section 883(a)(1)or 883(a)(2), gain on the disposition of stock of a domestic corporationthat is treated as a U.S. real property interest, and income that is exemptfrom tax under section 892. Section 1.884-1T(f)(3) requires that, in determining a foreign corporation'seffectively connected earnings and profits, deductions and other adjustmentsbe allocated and apportioned under the principles of andSection; 1.861-8between income that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or businessand produces effectively connected earnings and profits and income thatis effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business but does not produceeffectively connected earnings and profits. Section 1.884-1T(g) provides special rules for the calculation of effectivelyconnected earnings and profits and U.S. assets of foreign corporationscarrying on an insurance business in the United States. Consistent with Notice 87-56, 1987-2 C.B. 367, andSection; 1.884-1T(h) providesrules for the application of the branch profits tax to a foreign corporationthat is a qualified resident (as defined in andSection; 1.884-5T) of a countrywith which the United States has an income tax treaty. Section 1.884-1T(h)(1)provides that a foreign corporation that is a resident of a country withwhich the United States has an income tax treaty may claim an exemptionor rate reduction with respect to a dividend equivalent amount for thetaxable year only if either (1) the foreign corporation is a qualifiedresident of the treaty country because its stock is primarily and regularlytraded on an established securities market in its country of residenceor in the United States (within the meaning of andSection; 1.884-5T(d)),or it is engaged in an active trade or business in its country of residence(within the meaning of andSection; 1.884-5T(e)), or it has obtained a rulingdescribed in andSection; 1.884-5T(f), or (2) it meets, with respect to thedividend equivalent amount, the requirements of a limitation on benefitsarticle in an income tax treaty and the article entered into force afterDecember 31, 1986. A foreign corporation that is a qualified resident ofits country of residence because it meets the stock ownership and baseerosion requirements of andSection; 1.884-5T (b) and (c) is required to establishits qualified residence status for a 36-month period which includes theyear in which the dividend equivalent amount arises. A foreign corporationthat fails that requirement and is not otherwise a qualified resident onother grounds may claim treaty benefits only with respect to the portionsof its dividend equivalent amount that are attributable; on a last-in-first-outbasis, to taxable years in which it was a qualified resident.Section 1.884-1T(h)(3) provides that the branch profits tax will not beimposed on the portion of the dividend equivalent amount with respect towhich a foreign corporation satisfies the qualified residence requirements(including the 36-month test where applicable) for a country listed inthat section, so long as the income tax treaty between the United Statesand the country, as in effect on January 1, 1987, remains in effect andis not modified by subsequent agreement to expressly provide for the impositionof the branch profits tax. The effect on the branch profits tax of non-discriminationprovisions in income tax treaties is currently under consideration in connectionwith the forthcoming Treasury Department study of the tax treaty program.Section 1.884-1T(h)(4) provides that a foreign corporation that is a qualifiedresident of a country with which the United States has an income tax treatybut that is not entitled to exemption from the branch profits tax underandSection; 1.884-1T(h)(3) may claim treaty benefits such as a reductionin the rate of the branch profits tax. The section lists the rate of taxon qualified residents under existing income tax treaties and providesrules for corporations that are qualified residents of Canada. Section 1.884-1T(h)(5) reserves with respect to benefits under treatiesother than income tax treaties (such as Friendship, Commerce and Navigationtreaties) in view of provisions in the technical corrections bill. Section 1.884-1T(i) provides that, if a foreign corporation and a domesticcorporation are stapled entities within the meaning of section 269B(c)(2),the foreign corporation shall nonetheless be treated as a foreign corporationfor all purposes of the branch tax. Special Rules for the Termination or Incorporation of a U.S. Trade or Businessor the Liquidation or Reorganization of a Foreign Corporation or its DomesticSubsidiary Section 1.884-2T contains rules announced in Notice 86-17, 1986-2 C.B.379. It provides special exemption rules for a foreign corporation thatcompletely terminates all of its U.S. trade or business as well as rulesfor the application of the branch profits tax in the case of the tax-freereorganization or liquidation of a foreign corporation with a U.S. tradeor business, the tax-free incorporation of a U.S. trade or business ofa foreign corporation, and certain transactions with respect to a domesticsubsidiary of a foreign parent corporation. Under andSection; 1.884-2T(a)(1), a foreign corporation's effectively connectedearnings and profits and non-previously taxed accumulated effectively connectedearnings and profits are extinguished as a result of a complete terminationof all of the U.S. trade and business of a foreign corporation.Section 1.884-2T(a)(2) states the four conditions for a foreign corporationto completely terminate all of its U.S. trade and business with respectto a particular taxable year: (1) At the end of that year, it must haveno U.S. assets; (2) for the following three taxable years, it must haveno income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. tradeor business (other than by reason of section 864 (c)(6) or (c)(7)); (3)for the following three taxable years, neither itself nor a related corporationmay use, directly or indirectly, any of the U.S. assets of the terminatedU.S. trades or businesses, or property attributable to such property orto the foreign corporation's effectively connected earnings and profitsearned in the year of complete termination of a U.S. trade or business;and (4) the foreign corporation must waive the period of limitations forthe year of complete termination. Under andSection; 1.884-2T(b), a foreign corporation may elect, for a maximumtwo-year period, to treat marketable securities as U.S. assets. This electionis a special relief measure designed for foreign corporations that mayhave liquidated all of their U.S. assets or retired them from use in aU.S. trade or business but continue to hold cash or property with the expectationof continuing a U.S. trade or business in the near future. The proceduresapplying to this election, including transitional rules, and its effects,are similar to the election for expansion capital in andSection; 1.884-1T(d)(11).Section 1.884-2T(c) recognizes that the branch profits tax generally shouldnot be imposed with respect to the transfer of U.S. assets by a foreigncorporation merely as a result of a non-divisive tax-free reorganization(into a domestic or foreign corporation) or liquidation described in section381(a). On the other hand, andSection; 1.884-2T(c) reflects the fact thata foreign corporation that reorganizes does not completely terminate itsU.S. trade and business and, therefore, cannot escape branch profits taxliability under the complete termination rules. That section provides rulesfor computing the dividend equivalent amount of the foreign corporationand its transferee in the year of the transaction and subsequent taxableyears. Consistent with Notice 86-17, 1986-2 C.B. 379, andSection; 1.884-2T(d) providesthat a foreign corporation may transfer part or all of its U.S. assetsto a domestic corporation in a section 351(a) transfer without branch profitstax consequences provided that the foreign corporation owns, after thetransaction, and without regard to other transferors, at least 80 percentof the voting stock and value of the transferee, the transferee agreesto be allocated an amount of the foreign corporation's effectively connectedearnings and profits and non-previously taxed accumulated effectively connectedearnings and profits in proportion to the U.S. assets transferred, andthe foreign corporation agrees to an increase in its dividend equivalentamount in the event of its disposition of the stock or securities of thetransferee received in the exchange. Section 1.884-2T(e) provides special rules for certain transactions withrespect to a domestic subsidiary of a foreign corporation. Interaction of the Branch Profits Tax and Second-Tier Withholding Section 1.884-3T reserves with respect to the interaction of the branchprofits tax and second-tier withholding in view of the technical correctionsbill. Branch-Level Interest Tax Section 1.884-4T(a) provides that, for purposes of sections 871, 881, 1441and 1442, interest paid by a U.S. trade or business (within the meaningof andSection; 1.884-4T(b)) of a foreign corporation that is engaged in tradeor business in the United States is treated as paid by a domestic corporation.The technical corrections bill would make andSection; 1.884-4T(a) effectivefor all purposes of Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code but this provisionhas not been incorporated in the regulations. Such interest is subjectto withholding under section 1441 or 1442 unless exempt under the Codeor an income tax treaty. A foreign corporation is treated as engaged intrade or business in the United States if, during the taxable year, ithas U.S. assets (as defined in andSection; 1.884-1T(d)) or gross income thatis effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business.The regulations do not incorporate the technical corrections bill's provisionthat would exempt interest paid by an international organization from thebranch tax on interest. Section 1.884-4T(a)(2) provides generally that, if the interest allowableas a deduction under andSection; 1.882-5 in computing a foreign corporation'seffectively connected taxable income exceeds certain interest paid by aU.S. trade or business of the foreign corporation, the excess shall betreated as interest paid to the foreign corporation by a wholly-owned domesticcorporation and shall be subject to tax under section 881(a). Section 1.884-4T(a)(3) provides that the term ``interest'' includes originalissue discount, as defined in section 1273(a)(1). Section 1.884-4T(b)(1) defines the term ``interest paid by a U.S. tradeor business'' as interest that is paid with respect to one of four classesof liabilities. The first class consists of liabilities identified as liabilitiesof a U.S. trade or business on the foreign corporation's books. The remainingclasses generally consist of liabilities that are treated as liabilitiesof a U.S. trade or business for regulatory or income tax purposes, thatare predominantly secured by U.S. assets, or that give rise to certainnondeductible interest, such as capitalized interest, that is related toU.S. assets. Section 1.884-4T(b)(2) generally requires that interest with respect tothe class of liabilities that is booked to the U.S. trade or business mustbe treated as interest paid by a U.S. trade or business in all subsequentyears. Section 1.884-4T(b)(3) provides generally that liabilities in the classof liabilities booked to the U.S. trade or business will not give riseto interest paid by a U.S. trade or business of a foreign corporation ifthe foreign corporation receives a tax benefit from a foreign country withrespect to the interest that is inconsistent with the treatment of theinterest as paid by a U.S. trade or business, the liability is incurredin the ordinary course of a trade or business conducted by the foreigncorporation outside the United States (subject to a special rule for bankdeposits over $100,000), or the liability is predominantly secured by assetsthat are not U.S. assets. Section 1.884-4T(b)(4) provides that interbranch liabilities are not treatedas interest paid by a U.S. trade or business.Section 1.884-4T(b)(5) generally requires that if 80 percent or more ofa foreign corporation's assets are U.S. assets, the amount of interestpaid by a U.S. trade or business will be increased, if necessary, to equalthe foreign corporation's interest deduction under andSection; 1.882-5 andits nondeductible interest. Where a foreign corporation conducts its businessprimarily in the United States, it comports more closely with economicreality to treat the foreign corporation's interest payments as being madefrom a domestic corporation to the actual recipients of the interest payments(<T3>i.e., </T3>as interest paid by a U.S. trade or business) rather thanto the foreign corporation (<T3>i.e., </T3>as excess interest). Section 1.884-4T(b)(6) generally provides for a reduction in interest paidby a U.S. trade or business of a foreign corporation where such interestexceeds the amount of the interest deduction allowed to the foreign corporationunder andSection; 1.882-5 and the amount of any nondeductible interest paidby a U.S. trade or business during the taxable year. Ordering rules aregiven for the reduction. Section 1.884-4T(b)(7) permits a foreign corporation to elect to reduceits excess interest by the amount of interest paid by a U.S. trade or businessthat accrues in a different taxable year than the year in which the interestis paid. Under this election, the interest is treated as interest paidby a U.S. trade or business in the earlier of the year it is paid or accrues.This election prevents the same interest payment from being included asboth interest paid by a U.S. trade or business and excess interest. Section 1.884-4T(b)(8) describes the effect of treaties on interest paidby a U.S. trade or business. Section 1.884-4T(b)(8)(i) generally providesthat relief is available under the payor foreign corporation's income taxtreaty only if the foreign corporation is a qualified resident (as definedin andSection; 1.884-5T(a)) of the treaty country for the taxable year inwhich the interest is paid or for the prior year and the protion of thecurrent year that ends with the date of payment, or meets the requirementsof the treaty's limitation on benefits article and the article enteredinto force after December 31, 1986. Section 1.884-4T(b)(8)(ii) generallyprovides that relief is available under a recipient foreign corporation'sincome tax treaty under the tests described in the preceding sentence appliedwith respect to the recipient. Section 1.884-4T(b)(8)(iii) reserves withrespect to the effect of treaties other than income tax treaties (suchas Friendship, Commerce and Navigation treaties) on interest paid by aU.S. trade or business in view of the pending technical corrections bill.Section 1.884-4T(c) provides rules for the computation of the tax on excessinterest. Section 1.884-4T(c)(2) provides generally that a foreign corporation'sdistributive share of partnership interest will reduce the foreign corporation'sexcess interest. Under this rule, interest paid by the partnership is treatedas if it were paid directly by the foreign corporation for purposes ofdetermining the amount of the foreign corporation's excess interest, andinterest paid by the partnership is not subject to taxation both undersection 871(a) or 881 and as excess interest. Section 1.884-4T(c)(3) provides that excess interest of a foreign corporationthat is a qualified resident of a treaty country is taxed at a rate notexceeding the reduced rate of tax or exemption provided under such treatyfor interest paid by a domestic corporation to a resident of the treatycountry. However, exemptions or reduced rates of tax under treaty provisionsdealing with interest paid by a resident of the treaty country do not applyto excess interest. The regulations reserve with respect to treaties otherthan income tax treaties. Section 1.884-4T(c)(3) does not address the effect,if any, of non-discrimination provisions in income tax treaties. This issueis presently under consideration in connection with the forthcoming TreasuryDepartment study of the tax treaty program. Qualified Resident Section 1.884-5T(a) provides that a foreign corporation that is a residentof a foreign country for purposes of an income tax treaty if a qualifiedresident of that country if either (1) it meets a stock ownership and baseerosion test; (2) it is publicly-traded in its country of residence orin the United States; (3) it is engaged in the active conduct of a tradeor business in its country of residence; or (4) it obtains a ruling thatits establishment or maintenance in its country of residence is not forthe purpose of obtaining treaty benefits. Section 1.884-5T(b)(1) provides generally that a foreign corporation meetsthe ownership test if at least 50 percent (by value) of its stock is ownedby individual residents of the foreign corporation's country of residence,or by U.S. citizens or residents, during at least half of the number ofdays in the foreign corporation's taxable year and it obtains the documentationrequired under andSection; 1.884-5T(b)(3) to show that the ownership testhas been met. The technical corrections bill would require more than 50percent qualified ownership. Section 1.884-5T(b)(2) sets forth constructive ownership rules under whichstock owned by entities is treated as owned by individuals. Section 1.884-5T(b)(2)(i)provides rules for determining the extent to which stock owned indirectlyby an individual through a corporation, partnership, trust or estate istreated as being owned by the individual. Section 1.884-5T(b)(2)(ii) treatsstock owned by the government of a country as if it were owned by individualresidents of that country. Section 1.884-5T(b)(2)(iii) generally treats stock owned by a corporationthat is publicly traded in its country of residence as if it were ownedby individual residents of that country. Section 1.884-5T(b)(2)(iv) generallytreats a class of stock of a corporation that is publicly traded in thecorporation's country of residence as if it were owned by individual residentsof that country. Section 1.884-5T(b)(3) indicates the documentation a foreign corporationis required to obtain in order to establish that it satisfies the ownershiptest. This documentation may take one of two forms: Individual documentation(certification of the individual's direct or indirect stock ownership andresidency) or an intermediary verification statement (certification byan intermediary that owns (directly or indirectly) stock of the foreigncorporation that it holds individual documentation from an indirect individualshareholder of the foreign corporation). The purpose of the intermediaryverification statement is to permit an individual who owns stock in a foreigncorporation through a nominee, holding company, or other entity to preserveanonymity vis-a-vis the foreign corporation. Where stock of a foreign corporationis held indirectly by an individual, any intermediaries standing in thechain of the individual's ownership of stock in a foreign corporation mustfurnish an intermediary ownership statement declaring its direct ownershipof another intermediary in the chain of ownership or its direct ownershipof the stock of the foreign corporation. Section 1.884-5T(c) describes the base erosion test, which generally requiresthat not more than 50 percent of a foreign corporation's income for thetaxable year be used to meet liabilities to persons who are not residents(or, in the case of foreign corporations, qualified residents) of the foreigncorporation's country of residence and who are not U.S. citizens or residents(or, in the case of corporations, qualified residents). Section 1.884-5T(d) prescribes rules under which a foreign corporationwhose stock is primarily and regularly traded on one or more establishedsecurities markets in the foreign corporation's country of residence orthe United States is treated as a qualified resident of its country ofresidence. In addition, a foreign corporation is treated as a qualifiedresident of its country of residence if 90 percent of its stock (by valueand voting power) is owned by another corporation that is a resident ofthe same foreign country and whose stock is primarily and regularly tradedon one or more established securities markets in that country or in theUnited States.Section 1.884-5T(d)(2)(i) defines the term ``established securities market''to include a foreign securities exchange that is officially recognizedor supervised by a governmental authority in the country in which the exchangeis located, is the principal exchange in that country, and has an annualshare turnover exceeding $1 billion. A domestic exchange that is a nationalsecurities exchange registered under the Securities Act of 1934 and a domesticover-the-counter market are also treated as established securities markets.Section 1.884-5T(d)(2)(v) gives the Commissioner authority to treat a foreignsecurities exchange that does not come within the definition of an establishedsecurities market but has the attributes of such a market as an establishedsecurities market. Similarly, andSection; 1.884-5T(d)(2)(vi) gives the Commissionerauthority to disqualify a foreign securities exchange that meets the definitionof an established securities exchange but does not have adequate listing,financial disclosure or trading requirements, or does not enforce suchrequirements. Section 1.884-5T(d)(3) provides that stock of a foreign corporation isprimarily traded on an established securities market in its country ofresidence if more than 80 percent of the voting power and value of thestock of the foreign corporation is listed and regularly traded on oneor more established securities markets and the volume of trading (on aclass-by-class basis) on one or more established securities markets inthe country of residence and in the United States exceeds the volume oftrading on established securities markets in any other foreign country.Section 1.884-5T(d)(4)(i) states that a class of stock is regularly tradedon an established securities market if stock in that class is traded, otherthan in <T3>de minimis</T3> quantities, on at least 60 days during the taxableyear and there is a turnover during the taxable year equal to at least30 percent of the shares in the class. In the case of a foreign corporationwith 2,500 or more shareholders of record, the turnover requirement isreduced to 10 percent. Under andSection; 1.884-5T(d)(4)(ii), a class of stock that would otherwisebe treated as regularly traded will not be treated as regularly tradedif 100 or fewer persons own 50 percent or more of the outstanding sharesof such class. Section 1.884-5T(d)(4)(iii) contains an anti-abuse rule that disregardstrades between related persons and trades conducted so that the class willmeet the regularly traded requirement. Section 1.884-5T(e) generally provides that a foreign corporation is treatedas a qualified resident of its country of residence if it has a substantialpresence in that country and conducts a U.S. trade or business that isan integral part of a trade or business that is actively conducted in thatcountry. Section 1.884-5T(e)(2) states that a foreign corporation is engaged inthe active conduct of a trade or business if it meets the requirementsof the regulations under section 367(a)(3). Special rules are providedfor banks and insurance companies. Under andSection; 1.884-5T(e)(3), whether a foreign corporation has a substantialpresence in its country of residence is determined by comparing the ratioof the assets, gross income and payroll expense of its active trades orbusinesses in its country of residence to its worldwide assets, gross incomeand payroll expenses. If each ratio is at least equal to 20 percent andthe average of the ratios exceeds 25 percent, the foreign corporation hasa substantial presence in its country of residence. Section 1.884-5T(e)(4)(i) provides that a U.S. trade or business of a foreigncorporation is an integral part of a trade or business that is activelyconducted by the foreign corporation in its country of residence if thebusinesses are complementary and mutually interdependent steps in the productionand sale or lease of goods, or the performance of services. If the U.S.trade or business sells goods that are not manufactured, grown or extractedby the foreign corporation in its country of residence, the business inno event shall be treated as an integral part of a trade or business activelyconducted in the foreign corporation's country of residence if the foreigncorporation does not take physical possession of the goods in its countryof residence. Section 1.884-5T(e)(4)(ii) treats a U.S. trade or business as an integralpart of a trade or business that is actively conducted by a foreign corporationin its country of residence if the type of goods sold or services performedby the trade or business are substantially sold for consumption or disposition(or performed) in the foreign corporation's country of residence. Section 1.884-5T(f) generally gives the Commissioner authority to rulethat a foreign corporation will be treated as a qualified resident of itscountry of residence if the Commissioner determines that the establishmentor maintenance of the foreign corporation in its country of residence doesnot have as one of its principal purposes obtaining benefits under theincome tax treaty between the United States and that country. <ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses </ITAG>It has been determined that this temporary regulation is not a major ruleas defined in Executive Order 12291 and that a Regulatory Impact Analysisis therefore not required.

(temporary) </ITAG>(a) <T3>Introduction. </T3>Section 884 consists of three main parts: A branchprofits tax on certain earnings of a foreign corporation's U.S. trade orbusiness; a branch-level interest tax on interest paid, or deemed paid,by a foreign corporation's U.S. trade or business; and an anti-treaty shoppingrule. For purposes of the regulations under section 884, the term ``a U.S.trade or business'' includes all the U.S. trades or businesses of a foreigncorporation. (1) <T3>The branch profits tax. </T3>Section 1.884-1T provides rules for computingthe branch profits tax and defines various terms that affect the computationof the tax. In general, section 884(a) imposes a 30-percent branch profitstax on the after-tax earnings of a foreign corporation's U.S. trade orbusiness that are not reinvested in a U.S. trade or business by the closeof the taxable year, or are disinvested in a later taxable year. Changesin the value of the equity of the foreign corporation's U.S. trade or businessare used as the measure of whether earnings have been reinvested in, ordisinvested from, a U.S. trade or business. An increase in the equity duringthe taxable year is generally treated as a reinvestment of the earningsfor the current taxable year; a decrease in the equity during the taxableyear is generally treated as a disinvestment of prior year's earnings thathave not previously been subject to the branch profits tax. The amountsubject to the branch profits tax for the taxable year is the dividendequivalent amount. Section 1.884-2T contains special rules relating tothe effect on the branch profits tax of the termination or incorporationof a U.S. trade or business or the liquidation or reorganization of a foreigncorporation or its domestic subsidiary. (2) <T3>The branch-level interest tax. </T3>Section 1.884-4T provides rulesfor computing the branch-level interest tax. In general, interest paidby a U.S. trade or business (as defined in andSection; 1.884-4T(b)) of aforeign corporation is treated as if it were paid by a domestic corporationand may be subject to tax under section 871(a) or 881, and to withholdingunder section 1441 or 1442. In addition, if the interest allowable as adeduction under andSection; 1.882-5 in computing a foreign corporation'seffectively connected taxable income exceeds certain interest paid by aU.S. trade or business of the foreign corporation, the excess is treatedas interest paid to the foreign corporation by a wholly-owned domesticcorporation and is subject to tax under section 881(a). (3) <T3>Qualified residents. </T3>Section 1.884-5T provides rules for determiningwhether a foreign corporation is a qualified resident of a foreign country.In general, a foreign corporation must be a qualified resident of a foreigncountry with which the United States has an income tax treaty in orderto claim an exemption or rate reduction with respect to the branch profitstax, the branch-level interest tax, and the tax on dividends paid by theforeign corporation.

The branch profits taxshall be in addition to the tax imposed by section 882 and shall be reportedon a foreign corporation's income tax return for the taxable year. Thetax shall be due and payable as provided in section 6151 and such otherprovisions of Subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code as apply to the incometax liability of corporations. However, no estimated tax payments shallbe due with respect to a foreign corporation's liability for the branchprofits tax. See paragraph (h) of this section for the application of thebranch profits tax to corporations that are residents of countries withwhich the United States has an income tax treaty, and andSection; 1.884-2Tfor the effect on the branch profits tax of the termination or incorporationof a U.S. trade or business, or the liquidation or reorganization of aforeign corporation or its domestic subsidiary. (b) <T3>Dividend equivalent amount_</T3>(1) <T3>Definition. </T3>The term ``dividend equivalent amount'' means a foreigncorporation's effectively connected earnings and profits (as defined inparagraph (f)(1) of this section) for the taxable year subject to the adjustmentsin paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section. The dividend equivalentamount cannot be less than zero. (2) <T3>Adjustment for increase in U.S. net equity. </T3>If a foreign corporation'sU.S. net equity (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) as of theclose of the taxable year exceeds the foreign corporation's U.S. net equityas of the close of the preceding taxable year, then, for purposes of computingthe foreign corporation's dividend equivalent amount for the taxable year,the foreign corporation's effectively connected earnings and profits forthe taxable year shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount ofsuch excess. (3) <T3>Adjustment for decrease in U.S. net equity_</T3>(i) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of thissection and in andSection; 1.884-2T, if a foreign corporation's U.S. netequity as of the close of the taxable year is less than the foreign corporation'sU.S. net equity as of the close of the preceding taxable year, then, forpurposes of computing the foreign corporation's dividend equivalent amountfor the taxable year, the foreign corporation's effectively connected earningsand profits for the taxable year shall be increased by the amount of suchdifference. (ii) <T3>Limitation based on non-previously taxed accumulated effectively connectedearnings and profits. </T3>The increase of a foreign corporation's effectivelyconnected earnings and profits under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this sectionshall not exceed the non-previously taxed accumulated effectively connectedearnings and profits of the foreign corporation as of the close of thepreceding taxable year. The term ``non-previously taxed accumulated effectivelyconnected earnings and profits'' means the excess of the aggregate amountof effectively connected earnings and profits of a foreign corporationfor preceding taxable years over the aggregate dividend equivalent amountsfor such preceding taxable years. The aggregate amount of effectively connectedearnings and profits for preceding taxable years shall not include effectivelyconnected earnings and profits for taxable years beginning before January1, 1987. (4) <T3>Examples. </T3>The principles of paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of thissection are illustrated by the following examples.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>Foreign corporation A, a calendar year taxpayer,had $1,000 U.S. net equity as of the close of 1986 and $100 of effectivelyconnected earnings and profits for 1987. A acquires $100 of additionalU.S. assets during 1987 and its U.S. net equity as of the close of 1987is $1,100. In computing A's dividend equivalent amount; for 1987, A's effectivelyconnected earnings and profits of $100 are reduced under paragraph (b)(2)of this section by the $100 increase in U.S. net equity between the closeof 1986 and the close of 1987. A has no dividend equivalent amount for1987. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume the same facts as in <T3>Example (1) </T3>for 1987. A has no effectively connected earningsand profits for 1988. A's U.S. net equity decreases by $40 during 1988and its U.S. net equity is $1,060 as of the close of 1988. A has a dividendequivalent amount of $40 for 1988, even though it has no effectively connectedearnings and profits for 1988. A's effectively connected earnings and profitsof $0 for 1988 are increased under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this sectionby the $40 reduction in U.S. net equity (subject to the limitation in paragraph(b)(3)(ii) of this section of $100 of non-previously taxed accumulatedeffectively connected earnings and profits). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>Assume the same facts as in <T3>Example (1)</T3> except that A acquires $40 of U.S. assets during 1987and its U.S. net equity as of the close of 1987 is $1,040. In computingA's dividend equivalent amount for 1987, A's effectively connected earningsand profits of $100 are reduced under paragraph (b)(2) of this sectionby the $40 increase in U.S. net equity between the close of 1986 and theclose of 1987. A has a dividend equivalent amount of $60 for 1987. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4). </T3>Assume the same facts as in <T3>Example (3)</T3> for 1987. For 1988, A has $125 of effectively connectedearnings and profits and its U.S. net equity decreases by $50. A.'s U.S.net equity as of the close of 1988 is $990 ($1,040-$50). In computing A'sdividend equivalent amount, the $125 of effectively connected earningsand profits for 1988 is not increased under paragraph (b)(3)(i) by thefull amount of the $50 decrease in U.S. net equity during 1988, becausethe increase in effectively connected earnings and profits resulting froma decrease in U.S. net equity is limited to A's non-previously taxed accumulatedeffectively connected earnings and profits as of the close of 1987. A had$100 of effectively connected earnings and profits for 1987 and a dividendequivalent amount of $60 for that year, so A has $40 of non-previouslytaxed accumulated effectively connected earnings and profits as of theclose of 1987. The increase in effectively connected earnings and profitsresulting from a decrease in U.S. net equity is thus limited to $40, andthe dividend equivalent amount for 1988 is $165 ($125 effectively connectedearnings and profits + $40 decrease in U.S. net equity).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (5). </T3>(i) Foreign corporation A, a calendar year taxpayer,has $150 of non-previously taxed accumulated effectively connected earningsand profits as of the close of 1990, and has a $90 deficit in effectivelyconnected earnings and profits for 1991.

A portion of the reduction in U.S.net equity in 1991 is attributable to A's deficit in effectively connectedearnings and profits for that year and triggers a dividend equivalent amountonly to the extent the reduction in U.S. net equity exceeds the currentyear deficit in effectively connected earnings and profits for 1991. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) For 1992, A has no effectively connected earnings and profitsand its U.S. net equity decreases by $150 (to $200) during the year.

A has $50 of non-previously taxed accumulatedeffectively connected earnings and profits as of the close of 1991 (<T3>i.e., </T3>its non-previously taxed accumulated effectively connectedearnings and profits of $150 as of the close of 1990 less its $90 deficitin earnings and profits for 1991 less its dividend equivalent amount of$10 for 1991) and therefore has a dividend equivalent amount of $50 for1992. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (6). </T3>Foreign corporation A, a calendar year taxpayer,had a deficit in effectively connected earnings and profits of $100 for1987 and $100 for 1988, and has $90 of effectively connected earnings andprofits for 1989.

Whether a partnership interestis acquired, or partnership property is acquired or owned, for such purposewill depend upon all the facts and circumstances of each case. Factorsto be considered include whether the partnership conducts unrelated businessesor whether the partnership accumulates investment property unrelated toits trade or business or liquid assets in excess of the reasonable needsof its business. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(9)(iv), to be one ofthe principal purposes, a purpose must be important, but it is not necessarythat it be the primary purpose.(v) <T3>Example. </T3>The application of paragraph (d)(9)(iv) of this sectionis illustrated by the following example.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example. </T3>Foreign corporation A is a partner in partnership X andis entitled to 50 percent of the income of X and 50 percent of the valueof all property of X upon X's liquidation. X is engaged in an active U.S.real estate business which, during the taxable year, produces $100 of grossincome that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or businessin the United States. In the same taxable year, X acquires securities (fromfunds that are either generated by its business, borrowed or contributed)that produce $50 of gross income not effectively connected with the conductof a trade or business in the United States. The securities are unrelatedto the real estate business and substantially exceed the reasonable needsof the business. The real estate and the securities each have an adjustedbasis of $1,000. Under paragraph (d)(9)(i) of this section, two-thirds(50/75) of A's distributive share of partnership gross income is effectivelyconnected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States,and two-thirds of A's basis in its partnership interest (as determinedunder paragraph (d)(9)(ii) of this section) would therefore be treatedas a U.S. asset. However, because the securities acquired by X are unrelatedto X's real estate business and exceed the reasonable needs of the business,the district director may determine that a principal purpose of X's acquisitionof the securities is to increase artificially the U.S. assets of A. Thedistrict director may, therefore, compute the portion of A's interest inX that is treated as a U.S. asset by, for example, using the ratio of A'spro rata share of the adjusted basis of the property of X that producesincome that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or businessin the United States ($500) to A's pro rata share of all property of X($1,000). As a result, A would be treated as having a U.S. asset in anamount equal to half of A's basis in X (as determined under paragraph (d)(9)(ii)of this section).</ITAG>(10) <T3>Trusts and Estates. </T3>[Reserved] (11) <T3>Election to treat expansion capital as a U.S. asset_</T3>(i) <T3>General rule. </T3>A foreign corporation may elect, for any taxableyear, to treat as U.S. assets marketable securities (as defined in paragraph(d)(8) of this section) that are not otherwise U.S. assets provided thatthe fair market value of each such security on the date the security isidentified as a U.S. asset under paragraph (d)(11)(iii) of this sectionis not less than its adjusted basis on such date. The adjusted basis ofmarketable securities that may be treated as U.S. assets for any taxableyear shall not exceed 25 percent of the sum of the foreign corporation'seffectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year and thenon-previously taxed accumulated effectively connected earnings and profitsattributable to the two preceding taxable years. The securities must beheld for the entire taxable year following the year for which the electionis made or, if disposed of during that taxable year, must be replaced onthe date of disposition by other marketable securities that are purchasedon or before such date, or are received in exchange for the securitiesthat have been disposed of, and the fair market value of which as of thedate of substitution is not less than their adjusted basis. (ii) <T3>Treatment of income from deemed U.S. assets. </T3>The income or gainfrom marketable securities subject to an election under this paragraph(d)(11) that arises in the taxable year following the taxable year forwhich the election is made shall be treated as effectively connected withthe conduct of a trade or business in the United States (other than forpurposes of section 864(c)(7)), and losses from the disposition of suchmarketable securities shall be allocated entirely to income that is effectivelyconnected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.The marketable securities that are held on the last business day of thefollowing taxable year shall be treated as sold for their fair market valueon that day, and any gain (but not loss) and accrued interest shall betaken into account in such following taxable year as income that is effectivelyconnected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.The adjusted basis of such property shall be increased by the amount ofany gain recognized by reason of this paragraph (d)(11). (iii) <T3>Method of election. </T3>An election under this paragraph (d)(11) totreat marketable securities as U.S. assets may be made only with respectto securities identified on the books and records of the U.S. trade orbusiness within 30 days after the close of the taxable year for which theelection is made. The election shall be made by the foreign corporationfor any taxable year by attaching to its income tax return for the taxableyear a statement_ (A) Identifying the marketable securities that it elects to treat as U.S.assets under this paragraph (d)(11), (B) Setting forth the adjusted bases of such securities, and(C) Agreeing to treat any income, gain or loss from such securities (orreplacement securities) as provided in paragraph (d)(11)(ii) of this section.Such statement must be filed on or before the due date (including extensions)of the foreign corporation's income tax return for the taxable year. Fortaxable years ending on or before December 1, 1988, the election may bemade, and securities identified on the books and records of the foreigncorporation, on the later of the date on which the return is due (includingextensions) or 120 days after September 2, 1988. (iv) <T3>Ruling to permit an increase in expansion capital in cases of involuntaryconversion. </T3>If property that is a U.S. asset of a foreign corporationis compulsorily or involuntarily converted into property not similar orrelated in service or use to the converted property, the foreign corporationmay apply to the Commissioner for a ruling to increase the amount of marketablesecurities that may be treated as U.S. assets. The Commissioner may prescribeterms and conditions for the treatment of marketable securities as U.S.assets under this paragraph (d)(11)(iv). (12) <T3>Losses involving U.S. assets. </T3>If a foreign corporation sustainsa loss with respect to property that is a U.S. asset and is not alloweda deduction under section 165 for the entire amount of the loss becausethere exists a reasonable prospect of recovering compensation for the loss,the property shall be treated as a U.S. asset from the date of the lossin an amount equal to its adjusted basis immediately before the loss reduced(but not below zero) by_ (i) The amount of any deduction claimed under section 165 by the foreigncorporation with respect to the loss and  (ii) Any compensation received with respect to the loss. (13) <T3>Property that is not a U.S. asset_</T3>(i) <T3>Property that does not give rise to effectively connected earningsand profits. </T3>U.S. assets shall not include property of a foreign corporationif, on the determination date, income from the use of the property, orgain or loss from the disposition of the property, would be described inparagraph (f)(2) of this section (relating to certain income that doesnot produce effectively connected earnings and profits).

(iii) <T3>Assets acquired to increase U.S. net equity artificially. </T3>U.S.assets shall not include money or property acquired or used by a foreigncorporation if one of the principal purposes of such acquisition or useis to increase artificially the U.S. assets of a foreign corporation onthe determination date. Whether money or property is acquired or used forsuch purpose will depend upon all the facts and circumstances of each case.Factors to be considered in determining whether one of the principal purposesin acquiring or using such property is to increase artificially the U.S.assets of a foreign corporation include the length of time during whichthe asset was used in a U.S. trade or business, whether the asset was acquiredfrom, or disposed of to, a related person, and whether the aggregate valueof the U.S. assets of the foreign corporation increased temporarily onthe determination date. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(13)(iii), tobe one of the principal purposes, a purpose must be important, but it isnot necessary that it be the primary purpose. (14) <T3>Examples. </T3>The principles of this paragraph (d) are illustratedby the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>Foreign corporation A, a calendar year taxpayer,is engaged in a trade or business in the United States. A owns equipmentthat is used in its manufacturing business in country X and in the UnitedStates. The equipment has an adjusted basis (for purposes of computingearnings and profits) of $100 at the beginning of 1987. Under andSection;1.861-8, A's depreciation deduction is allocated to sales income and isapportioned 70 percent to income that is effectively connected with theconduct of a trade or business in the United States and 30 percent to incomethat is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or businessin the United States. A's depreciation deduction (for purposes of computingearnings and profits) with respect to the equipment is $10. As of the closeof 1987, the machine is treated as a U.S. asset with an adjusted basisof $63 (<T3>i.e., </T3>70 percent of $100 reduced by $7 of depreciation in 1987).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>(i) For 1987, foreign corporation A, a calendar yeartaxpayer, has $100 of effectively connected earnings and profits and hasno non-previously taxed accumulated effectively connected earnings andprofits. A elects under paragraph (d)(11) of this section to treat marketablesecurities with an adjusted basis of $25 as U.S. assets (<T3>i.e., </T3>25 percent of its effectively connected earnings and profitsfor 1987), the maximum amount permitted. A also reinvests $75 in 1987 inother U.S. assets. As a result of the reinvestment and election, A hasno dividend equivalent amount for 1987. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) For 1988, A has $100 of effectively connected earnings and profitsand $100 of non-previously taxed accumulated effectively connected earningsand profits attributable to its preceding taxable year. A elects to treatas U.S. assets marketable securities with an adjusted basis of $50 (<T3>i.e., </T3>25 percent of $200), the maximum amount permitted. A's U.S.net equity decreases by $20 during 1988 after taking into account the marketablesecurities which A elects to treat as U.S. assets. A's dividend equivalentamount for 1988 is $120 ($100 effectively connected earnings and profitsincreased by the $20 decrease in U.S. assets). The dividend equivalentamount in the current year does not affect the calculation of the amountof marketable securities that A may elect to treat as U.S. assets underparagraph (d)(11) of this section.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) For 1989, A has $56 of effectively connected earnings and profits.Its non-previously taxed accumulated effectively connected earnings andprofits attributable to the two preceding taxable years are $80 (<T3>i.e., </T3>$200 of effectively connected earnings and profits for thetwo preceding taxable years, reduced by the dividend equivalent amountof $120 for its 1988 taxable year). Thus, the maximum amount of marketablesecurities that A may elect under paragraph (d)(12) of this section totreat as U.S. assets for 1989 is $34 (<T3>i.e., </T3>25 percent of the sum of $56 and $80). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>Foreign corporation A owns a condominium apartmentin the United States.

Theasset valuation method used for purposes of this paragraph (e) must bethe same asset valuation method used for determining the amount of theforeign corporation's interest deduction that is apportioned to effectivelyconnected income under andSection; 1.882-5. (2) <T3>Liabilities of a partnership. </T3>If a foreign corporation is a partnerin a partnership, the worldwide liabilities of the foreign corporationshall include, for purposes of this section, the foreign corporation'sshare of the liabilities of the partnership (as determined under paragraph(d)(9)(iii) of this section). (3) <T3>Artificial decrease in U.S. liabilities. </T3>If a foreign corporationrepays or otherwise decreases its U.S. liabilities and one of the principalpurposes of such decrease is to decrease artificially its U.S. liabilitieson the determination date, then such decrease shall not be taken into accountfor purposes of computing the foreign corporation's U.S. net equity. Whetherthe U.S. liabilities of a foreign corporation are artificially decreasedwill depend on all the facts and circumstances of each case. Factors tobe considered in determining whether one of the principal purposes forthe repayment or decrease of the liabilities is to decrease artificiallythe U.S. liabilities of a foreign corporation shall include whether theaggregate liabilities are temporarily decreased as of the close of thetaxable year by, for example, the repayment of liabilities or the acquisitionwith contributed funds of passive-type assets that are not U.S. assets.For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), to be one of the principal purposes,a purpose must be important, but it is not necessary that it be the primarypurpose. (f) <T3>Effectively connected earnings and profits</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this sectionand as modified by andSection; 1.884-2T (relating to the incorporation orcomplete termination of a U.S. trade or business or the reorganizationor liquidation of a foreign corporation or its domestic subsidiary), theterm ``effectively connected earnings and profits'' means the earningsand profits (or deficits therein) determined under section 312 and thisparagraph (f) that are attributable to income that is effectively connected(or treated as effectively connected) with the conduct of a trade or businessin the United States. Effectively connected earnings and profits shallnot be reduced by distributions made by the foreign corporation duringany taxable year or by the amount of branch profits tax or tax on excessinterest (as defined in andSection; 1.884-4T(a)(2)) paid by the foreign corporation.Earnings and profits are attributable to income that is effectively connected(or treated as effectively connected) with the conduct of a trade or businessin the United States regardless of whether the earnings and profits aretaken into account under section 312 in an earlier or later taxable yearthan the taxable year in which the income is taken into account.

For this purpose,the provisions in andSection; 1.381(c)(2)-1 shall generally apply with properadjustments to reflect the fact that effectively connected earnings andprofits and non-previously taxed accumulated effectively connected earningsand profits are not affected by distributions to shareholders but, rather,by dividend equivalent amounts. Therefore, the amounts of effectively connectedearnings and profits and non-previously taxed accumulated effectively connectedearnings and profits that carry over to the transferee pursuant to thoseprovisions are reduced by the transferor's dividend equivalent amount forthe taxable year in which the section 381(a) transaction occurs. Such amountsare also reduced to the extent of any dividend equivalent amount determinedfor any succeeding taxable year solely as a result of the provisions ofparagraph (c)(3) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(4)(i),if the transferor accumulates non-previously taxed effectively connectedearnings and profits, or incurs a deficit in effectively connected earningsand profits, attributable to a period that is after the close of the taxableyear in which the section 381(a) transaction occurs and before the liquidationof the transferor, then such effectively connected earnings and profits,or deficits therein, shall be deemed to have been accumulated or incurredon or before the close of the taxable year in which the section 381(a)transaction occurs.(ii) <T3>Retention of character. </T3>All of the transferor's effectively connectedearnings and profits and non-previously taxed accumulated effectively connectedearnings and profits that carry over to the transferee shall constitutenon-previously taxed accumulated effectively connected earnings and profitsof the transferee. In the case of a domestic transferee, such non-previouslytaxed accumulated effectively connected earnings and profits shall alsoconstitute accumulated earnings and profits of the transferee for purposesof section 316(a)(2). (iii) <T3>Treatment of distributions by a domestic transferee out of non-previouslytaxed accumulated effectively connected earnings and profits. </T3>In theevent the transferee is a domestic corporation, distributions out of thetransferee's non-previously taxed accumulated effectively connected earningsand profits that are received by a foreign distributee shall qualify forbenefits under an applicable income tax treaty only (A) if the distributeequalifies for the benefits under such treaty and (B) to the extent thatthe transferor foreign corporation would have qualified under the principlesof andSection; 1.884-1T(h) (1) and (2)(i) for an exemption or reduction inrate with respect to the branch profits tax if the non-previously taxedaccumulated effectively connected earnings and profits had been reflectedin a dividend equivalent amount for the taxable year in which the section381(a) transaction occurs. (The tax rate on dividends specified in thetreaty between the distributee's country of residence and the United Statesshall apply to any dividends received by a distributee who qualifies fora treaty benefit under the preceding sentence.) In addition, distributionsout of such non-previously taxed accumulated effectively connected earningsand profits shall retain their character in the hands of any domestic distributeeup a chain of corporate shareholders for purposes of applying this paragraph(c)(4)(iii) to distributions made by any such person to a foreign distributee.If a domestic transferee has non-previously taxed accumulated effectivelyconnected earnings and profits carried over from the transferor as wellas accumulated earnings and profits, then each category of earnings andprofits shall be accounted for in two separate pools, and any distributionof earnings and profits shall be treated as a distribution out of eachpool in proportion to the respective amount of undistributed earnings andprofits in each pool. Section 871(i) (relating, in part, to dividends paidby a domestic corporation meeting the 80-percent foreign business requirementsof section 861(c)(1)) shall not apply to any dividends paid by a domestictransferee out of its non-previously taxed accumulated effectively connectedearnings and profits. (5) <T3>Determination of U.S. net equity of a transferee that is a foreigncorporation. </T3>In the event the transferee is a foreign corporation,then for purposes of determining the transferee's increase or decreasein U.S. net equity under andSection; 1.884-1T for its taxable year duringwhich the section 381(a) transaction occurs, its U.S. net equity as ofthe close of its immediately preceding taxable year shall be increasedby the amount of U.S. net equity acquired by the transferee from the transferorpursuant to the section 381(a) transaction, taking into account the adjustmentsto the basis (for earnings and profits purposes) of U.S. assets under theprinciples of section 362(b).

A does not make an election under paragraph (b)(6)(ii)of this section to specify liabilities that do not give rise to interestpaid by a U.S. trade or business. The amount of interest paid by a U.S.trade or business of A in 1990 is limited under paragraph (b)(6)(i) ofthis section to $230, the sum of the interest allowable to A as a deductionfor 1990 ($200) and the amount of interest paid during 1990 to F that increasesthe basis in a U.S. asset of A ($30). The amount of interest paid by aU.S. trade or business of A must thus be reduced by $110 ($340-$230) underparagraph (b)(6)(i) of this section. The reduction is first made with respectto interest attributable to liabilities described only in paragraph (b)(1)(i)of this section (</ITAG><T3>i.e., </T3>liabilities not on regulatory books or connected with U.S.assets) and, within the group of liabilities described only in paragraph(b)(1)(i) of this section, is first made with respect to the latest incurredliability.

The interest paid to D is no longer subjectto tax under section 871(a), and A may claim a refund of amounts withheldwith respect to the interest payments. There is no change in the tax consequencesto E because the interest received by E was portfolio interest and wasnot subject to tax when it was interest paid by a U.S. trade or business.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume the same facts as in <T3>Example (1) </T3>except that A makes an election under paragraph (b)(6)(ii)of this section to specify which liabilities are not to be treated as givingrise to interest paid by a U.S. trade or business. Also assume that theliability to C was identified in 1989 as a liability that gives rise tointerest paid by a U.S. trade or business. A may not specify, as liabilitiesthat do not give rise to interest paid by a U.S. trade or business, theliabilities to B or F, which are described in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and(iv) of this section, respectively, or the liability to C, which was identifiedin a preceding taxable year as a liability that gives rise to interestpaid by a U.S. trade or business. A specifies the liability to D, who wouldbe taxable at a rate of 15 percent on interest paid with respect to theliability, as a liability that does not give rise to interest paid by aU.S. trade or business, and D is therefore not subject to tax under section871(a) and is entitled to a refund of amounts withheld with respect tothe interest payments. A also specifies the liability to E as a liabilitythat gives rise to interest paid by a U.S. trade or business only in part.As a result, $30 of the $70 of interest paid to E is not treated as interestpaid by a U.S. trade or business of A, but this does not change the taxconsequences to E because the interest is portfolio interest that is notsubject to tax.</ITAG>(7) <T3>Election to reduce excess interest where interest is paid and accruedin different years_</T3>(i) <T3>Accrual before year of payment. </T3>A foreign corporation that accruesan interest expense that would be interest paid by a U.S. trade or businessof the foreign corporation in one or more later taxable years (before applicationof this paragraph (b)(7)(i)) may elect under this paragraph (b)(7) to reduceits excess interest for the taxable year in which the interest accruesby the amount of such interest expense.

The shareholdingsof individuals V and X are ignored in determining whether foreign corporationA meets the stock ownership of this paragraph (b) since neither of themis a U.S. citizen or a resident of the United States or of a country withwhich the United States has an income tax treaty. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume the same facts as in <T3>Example (1) </T3>and assume that foreign corporation A chooses to obtaindocumentation with respect to individuals T and U. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) With respect to T, foreign corporation A must obtain the individualdocumentation regarding T's shareholding in foreign corporation A which,pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) and (b)(4) of this section, consists ofan individual statement by T, as described in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of thissection. No certificate of residency need be furnished since T is a U.S.resident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) As to U's shareholding in foreign corporation A, U must providethe foreign trust FT with the individual documentation described in paragraph(b)(4) of this section; the trustees of FT must provide the depositorybank holding foreign corporation B's bearer shares with an intermediaryownership statement concerning its indirect beneficial ownership of foreigncorporation A's shares and must attach to it the individual documentationprovided by U. The depository bank has the choice of providing foreigncorporation B with either (A) an intermediary ownership statement regardingits direct ownership of shares in foreign corporation B on behalf of FT,to which must then be attached the individual documentation issued by Uand the intermediary ownership statement issued by FT, or (B) an intermediaryverification statement as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section,in which case foreign corporation B would not be provided with U's individualdocumentation or FT's intermediary ownership statement, both of which areretained by the depository bank. In either case, foreign corporation Bmust then provide foreign corporation A with an intermediary ownershipstatement regarding its direct beneficial ownership of shares in foreigncorporation A and, as the case may be, either (A) U's individual documentationand the intermediary ownership statements by FT and the depository bank,or (B) the depository bank's intermediary verification statement. Thus,with respect to U, foreign corporation A must obtain under paragraph (b)(3)(i)of this section the individual documentation regarding U and an intermediaryownership statement from each intermediary standing in the chain of U'sindirect beneficial ownership of shares in foreign corporation A, <T3>i.e., </T3>from FT, the depository bank and foreign corporation B.In the alternative, foreign corporation A must obtain under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)of this section an intermediary verification statement issued by the depositorybank and an intermediary ownership statement from foreign corporation B,which, in this example, is the only intermediary standing in the chainof ownership of the verifying intermediary (<T3>i.e., </T3>the depository bank). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>Assume the same facts as in <T3>Example (1). </T3>In addition, assume that foreign corporation A choosesto obtain documentation with respect to individuals U and W. With respectto U, foreign corporation A must obtain the same documentation that isdescribed in <T3>Example (2). </T3>With respect to W, foreign corporation A must obtain,under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, individual documentation regardingW and an intermediary ownership statement from each intermediary standingin the chain of W's indirect beneficial ownership of shares in foreigncorporation A, <T3>i.e., </T3>from individual Z, foreign corporation C, the depositorybank in the foreign treaty country, and foreign corporation D. In the alternative,foreign corporation A must obtain, under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section,either (i) an intermediary verification statement by the depository bankin the foreign treaty country and an intermediary ownership statement fromforeign corporation D or (ii) an intermediary verification statement fromindividual Z and an intermediary ownership statement from each intermediarystanding in the chain of ownership of shares in foreign corporation A,<T3>i.e., </T3>from foreign corporation C, the depository bank in the foreigntreaty country and foreign corporation D. Corporation C may not issue anintermediary verification statement because it is not a resident of a countrywith which the United States has an income tax treaty. </ITAG>(c) <T3>Base erosion. </T3>A foreign corporation satisfies the requirementrelating to base erosion for a taxable year (or for a portion of a taxableyear) if it establishes that less than 50 percent of its income for thetaxable year (or for the portion of the taxable year) is used (directlyor indirectly) to meet liabilities (such as liabilities to pay interest,rents, royalties, or reinsurance premiums) to persons who are not residents(or, in the case of foreign corporations, qualified residents) of the foreigncountry of which the foreign corporation is a resident and who are notcitizens or residents (or, in the case of domestic corporations, qualifiedresidents) of the United States. Whether a domestic corporation is a qualifiedresident of the United States shall be determined under the principlesof this section. The meeting of a liability does not include a repaymentof the principal amount of an obligation. For purposes of this paragraph(c), a liability is met in the taxable year (or portion of the taxableyear) in which the satisfaction, in whole or in part, of such liabilitygives rise (or would give rise if the portion of the taxable year werea short taxable year) to a tax benefit (including a deduction, an increasein the basis of an asset, or a tax credit) under U.S. tax principles.

Such a determination will be made only ifit is established that_ (A) The exchange, in substance, has the attributes of an established securitiesmarket (including adequate trading volume, and comparable listing and financialdisclosure requirements); (B) The rules of the exchange ensure active trading of listed stocks; and(C) The exchange is a member of the International Federation of Stock Exchanges.(vi) <T3>Discretion to determine that market does not qualify as establishedsecurities market. </T3>The Commissioner may, in his sole discretion, determinein a published document that a securities market that meets the requirementsof paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section does not qualify as an establishedsecurities market. Such determination shall be made if, in the view ofthe Commissioner_ (A) The market does not have adequate listing, financial disclosure, ortrading requirements (or does not adequately enforce such requirements)or (B) There is not clear and convincing evidence that the exchange ensuresthe active trading of listed stocks.

(ii) <T3>Closely-held companies not treated as regularly traded. </T3>If, atany time during the taxable year, 100 or fewer persons own 50 percent ormore of the outstanding shares of a class of stock, then such class ofstock shall not be treated as regularly traded for that year. Persons relatedwithin the meaning of section 267(b) shall be treated as one person forpurposes of this paragraph (d)(4)(ii).
