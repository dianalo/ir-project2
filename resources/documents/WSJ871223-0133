Three months ago, his investments in those accounts totaled about $20,000 -- the product of three years of savings. Mr. Fichtel, an internal auditor for CBS Inc., figured the diversity would buffer any setbacks in the market. But since October, the value of his holdings has plunged to about $15,000. Notable among the losers is his account at Lieber andamp; Co.'s Evergreen Fund, which is off 30% since he opened it in September.    So Mr. Fichtel is cutting his monthly mutual-fund deposits to $300, less than half his old level. And he has no plans to invest in any new funds. &quot;Even though I did my homework, I've been burned,&quot; Mr. Fichtel says. &quot;It's made me a little gun-shy.&quot;    For millions of investors, and hundreds of brokers and mutual-fund companies, the stock market crash signals the end of the five-year mutual-fund boom. In October, investors pulled a record $15.8 billion out of stock, bond and income funds. And industry watchers say more redemptions are likely.    &quot;It's like someone closed the door,&quot; says Edward Gundersen, mutual-fund manager for Dominick andamp; Dominick Inc., a New York broker. &quot;The money is just not coming in.&quot;    The industry is far from collapsing. Money-market and bond mutual funds are far more prevalent now than they were during the 1973-74 bear market. That means investors who want to dump their ailing stock funds may switch into a different mutual fund instead of abandoning funds altogether. And deposits in retirement-related mutual funds -- which hardly existed a decade ago -- remain fairly steady. Although assets in all funds have declined about 10% since August, they still remain 8% ahead of a year ago.    But October's jolt has clearly shaken the industry and its clients.    &quot;So far, many stock-fund investors have been gritting their teeth and holding on,&quot; says Charles Allmon, a longtime market bear and newsletter writer. But if stocks slump further, he contends, &quot;they'll get scared and sell.&quot;    Until recently, mutual funds were booming. Between 1982 and last August, assets of stock, bond and income funds tripled to nearly $850 billion.    But signs of a slowdown had already appeared months before stocks crumbled. Fixed-income funds, which had been responsible for most of the industry's sales growth during the past several years, were hammered in the spring when interest rates surged. Many novice investors were unaware that a bond fund's returns can evaporate if interest rates rise, because bond prices and rates move inversely.    Now, some brokers say, funds of any stripe just aren't selling. Mutual-fund sales at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York plummeted 60% in October and November from first-half figures. Asked which funds are hot, George Davies, mutual-fund manager for Smith Barney, replies: &quot;I wouldn't call anything hot at this point.&quot;    At Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., fund sales have fallen steadily since the spring. So far in 1987, fund purchases are down 20% compared with a year ago. But officials say the drop would be even steeper if not for a strong first quarter. Michael Remington, vice president for mutual-funds marketing, adds: &quot;There doesn't seem to be any clear-cut evidence suggesting a quick turnaround.&quot;    Some investors who pulled their money out of battered fixed-income funds won't be back anytime soon. Among them is William Zabowski, a Minneapolis advertising executive who invested in the Minnesota Tax-Free Municipal Bond Fund. He compares his bond-fund debacle -- in which a profit of $1,000 that took 12 months to earn was wiped out in three months -- to flying a plane. &quot;When you hit gut-wrenching turbulence, you have white knuckles for the rest of the flight,&quot; he says.    Even new services, such as the ability to redeem shares by phone, that had reassured many investors before October proved less than valuable when the crash occurred. &quot;With all the options I had, I froze at the switch,&quot; Mr. Zabowski says. He rode out declines in both his bond and stock funds without even trying to call and move his money.    Other investors have scaled back their mutual-fund holdings and are ready to get out at a moment's notice. William Baggerman, a retired executive in St. Charles, Mo., had accumulated about $300,000 in 15 equity funds during the past several years. But he now holds just three funds totaling about $15,000. Instead, he is investing largely in bank certificates of deposit.    &quot;I thought with so many smart people out there that by diversifying with all these funds, I'd come out OK,&quot; Mr. Baggerman says. &quot;But I wasn't buffered as much as I wanted on the downside.&quot;    Mr. Baggerman says he is nervous about his remaining mutual-fund holdings, and will immediately redeem shares if any of his investments drop 10%. &quot;I have my Federal Express envelope ready,&quot; he says with an uneasy laugh.    For the first time since 1982, many fund investors are flocking to the safe haven of short-term money-market accounts. These currently yield less than 7%, compared with as much as 15% in the early 1980s. But because the accounts' underlying short-term debt securities don't fluctuate as much as stocks and bonds, they provide virtual certainty against loss.    In October, investors moved a record $9.1 billion out of equity and bond funds into money markets, says Alfred Johnson, vice president and chief economist for Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade group. That money stayed within the fund industry, heartening some mutual-fund executives. But money markets generate smaller management fees for the fund companies.    One bright spot for the mutual-fund business is the $92.6 billion of retirement-plan assets that Americans hold in mutual funds. Industry executives predict that individuals probably won't move out of those funds because they are invested for the long run and will wait for the markets to bounce back.    Consider George Hewitt, a retired engineer in Erie, Pa. In August he invested $100,000 of his retirement money in four equity mutual funds -- and the paper value of those funds promptly fell $25,000. &quot;I'm not one of those who is back down to year-ago levels,&quot; Mr. Hewitt says.    Still, he has no plans to withdraw the cash from his funds, and most likely will invest more of his retirement cache next year. &quot;I'm just going to roll with the punches,&quot; he says.    Slumping sales are now prompting many fund companies to try to roll with the punches as well. Plans for new funds, for example, are being reconsidered. In the boom of the past few years, the industry started about one fund a day. Since 1980, the number of funds has grown fourfold to more than 2,300, according to the Investment Company Institute.    In November, however, just 18 new funds registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, less than one-half the number that filed in August, according to Charles E. Simon andamp; Co., a Washington research company. New stock funds are expected to dwindle, though one likely growth area is international funds, which capitalize on a weaker U.S. dollar.    There has been a switch in fund companies' marketing strategies. Instead of pushing hot new funds through performance rankings, companies are now emphasizing diversification. And with many investors unable to get through clogged telephone lines during the crash, companies are stressing service.    During the bull market, Fidelity Investments in Boston was perhaps best known for featuring performance numbers in its ads, often touting its Magellan fund as the top-performing fund during the past 10 years. Now the company is trying to sell long-term investing with its whole fund family -- not just one fund.    &quot;Diversify with Fidelity,&quot; a recent ad intones. &quot;It may not sound as exciting as taking the one-fund approach, but taking the long-term view is the best thing for most people to do,&quot; explains Michael Hines, vice president for marketing.    Many investors seem willing to sign on for the long-term, but with much less enthusiasm than before. Mr. Fichtel, the New Jersey auditor, says he thinks of himself as &quot;Mr. Long Term&quot; when it comes to fund investing. &quot;But I have to tell you,&quot; he says, turning off his home-computer screen, &quot;when the market was going up, I used to look at these numbers a whole lot more than I do now.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
