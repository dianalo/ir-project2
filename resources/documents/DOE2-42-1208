As a consequenceof magnetization it will receive magnetic body force and disturb magneticfield configuration suitably designed for plasma confinement. Then weare interested in a magnitude of the induced magnetic stress and therange of disturbed magnetic field. Here we analysed induced magneticinduction and magnetic stress for a beam-plate considering nonlineartyof B-H relation. In addition, we studied the magnetomechanical behaviorwith both the experimental and the computational analysis. We found thatthe magnetic torque due to magnetization is small and the extent of thedisturbed magnetic field due to a ferromagnetic body is limited.</TEXT></DOC>
