Both sides are trying to negotiate a new three-year contract, but the union has remained opposed to a company proposal for shifting a greater portion of health-care costs to employees.    The CWA represents about 40,000 Nynex workers. Also on strike are 20,000 employees represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.    No progress was reported in other strikes against San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group; Ameritech Corp., based in Chicago; or Bell Atlantic Corp., based in Philadelphia. In all, about 160,000 workers are striking the four regional phone companies. </TEXT></DOC>
