Inside a church of bamboo and palm leaves, she and otherrefugees paid respect at an altar with a traditional Cambodiangreeting: hands folded before their faces. Besides the altardrooped a Christmas tree with a cellophane star and plasticflowers. No Mass was offered since there are no priests among therefugees, and the foreign priests were away.   Sau Rany's father and her brother were killed by the KhmerRouge, and she fled to the U.N.-aided guerrilla camp in 1984because of food shortages and other hardships. She said God allowsher suffering ``probably to test my endurance.''   Vietnamese divisions invaded Cambodia on Dec. 25, 1978, endingnearly four years of Khmer Rouge rule and installing anothercommunist government. The U.N. border camps hold more than 300,000refugees from the conflict.   The war between the Phnom Penh government and a three-partyguerrilla coalition dominated by the Khmer Rouge has intensifiedsince Vietnam's troop pullout in late September.   Almost all those at the church were women and their children.``Usually we have more men here but today they are carrying weaponsand food at the border,'' Sau Rany explained.   One soldier, Bith Phonn, 42, made it to church after takingleave to look after his wife, eight months pregnant with theirninth child.   Bith Phonn displayed the scars from bullet wounds in both thighsand the back of his head. He said he has killed about 10 enemysoldiers in six years of fighting.   ``I know it is a sin, but if I don't kill him, he will killme,'' he said.   Relief officials and diplomats say that Prince NorodomSihanouk's group, which controls Site B, has stepped upconscription because the United States and other countries aresupplying aid to the guerrilla armies depending on their size.   The U.N. Border Relief Operation and the Internationalcommuittee of the Red Cross have told Sihanouk officials theyoppose what appear to be efforts to conscript minors.   One aid officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said alarge group of students, some as young as 14, were taken out of thecamp in August and earlier this month for military help.   The deputy Sihanouk administrator at Site B, Kun Kim Teng,claimed Sunday that all those involved were 18 or older. He saidthe students went for political, not military, training in August,and those who left this month were carrying food to civilians innewly liberated areas near the Thai border.   All were volunteers, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
