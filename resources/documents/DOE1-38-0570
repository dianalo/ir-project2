<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-38-0570 </DOCNO><TEXT>The metabolism of /sup 239/Pu and /sup 241/Am in 3 site-specific industrialdusts has been studied after their deposition in the rat lung. A comparativeexperiment has also been carried out with a mixture of these actinidesinhaled as their nitrates. The aim of this study was to provide an experimentalbasis for assessing limits on intake and to establish whether the /sup239/Pu content in the lungs could be interpolated from measurements of/sup 241/Am. The results demonstrate the wide differences in the lungretention kinetics of the actinides and in the absolute and relativeamounts translocated to the blood that can occur for industrially producedmaterials. The annual limits on intake (ALIs) for the different materialsvary between those postulated for class W and Y compounds by the InternationalCommission on Radiological Protection. Acute intakes of /sup 239/Pu equivalentto the ALI can, depending on the nature of the dust, be estimated from/sup 241/Am chest monitoring data at times from a few days up to about3 years after exposure.</TEXT></DOC>
