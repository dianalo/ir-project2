But a spokesman for the U.S. Tennis Association said the teammembers already have been selected and it is unlikely a playerwould be bumped to make room for Lendl even if the Czech nativereceives U.S. citizenship and clears another series of proceduralhurdles to become eligible.   ``This would put us in a very difficult situation,'' said EdFabricius, director of communications for the association. ``Idon't see it happening. We've already selected the team.''   The committee's voice vote came one week after a Houseimmigration subcommittee, which traditionally opposes Olympic-tiedexemptions, agreed to the measure.   The bill would waive for Lendl the five-year period permanentresidents are required to wait before receiving citizenship.   Lendl, 28, the world's No. 1-ranked tennis player, is a nativeof Czechoslovakia, but has lived in Greenwich, Conn., since 1981and has adopted the United States as his home.   Two other potential Olympic athletes also won committee approvalfor fast-track citizenship. Jens-Peter Burntd is an East Germanswimmer who defected in 1985 and is living in Alabama. GagikBarseghian is an Armenian wrestler who moved to California in 1986.   If the citizenship bill is enacted, Lendl would have torepresent the United States in the Davis Cup in July to be eligiblefor the Olympics. And since he has previously representedCzechoslovakia in Davis Cup competition, he would have to secure awaiver from the International Tennis Federation.   After that, the Czech Olympic Committee would have to give Lendla waiver to play in the Olympics.</TEXT></DOC>
