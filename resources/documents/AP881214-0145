Union leaders called Spain's first general strike in 54 years a``complete success.'' Police reported sporadic violence and made atleast 30 arrests.   ``The government has to bow to the evidence and accept withelegance the fact that this strike has been a total success,'' saidAnton Saracibar, second in command of the socialist General WorkersUnion.   Jose Manuel de la Parra, spokesman for the Communist-dominatedWorkers Commissions, said the strike succeeded ``beyond our greatestexpectations.''   Parra and Saracibar estimated 7.8 million of 11.8 millionemployed Spaniards stayed away from work to protest governmentausterity measures.   Government spokesman Miguel Gil said the strike call had beenheeded by ``a large sector of the population and has caused asignificant impact on labor activity, although in varying degrees indifferent sectors.''   The three major business associations accused union picketers of``strong-armed tactics'' to force small businesses and offices toclose after they opened Wednesday.   Socialist leader Jose Maria Benegas said people stayed away outof fear and intimidation. Madrid's Socialist Mayor Juan Barrancosaid people had to admit the strike succeeded in keeping most of thecity's 4 million people at home.   General Motors spokesman Rafael Casas said only 250administrative employees showed up at their Opel plant, whichemploys 9,100 in Zaragoza.   Spanish national railways spokeswoman Alicia Acebes said 7percent of the company's 54,000 employees showed up in accordancewith minimum service agreements.   In an unusual action binding them for the first time since Spainreturned to democracy 11 years ago, the General Workers' Union andthe Workers Commissions called the strike to force Prime MinisterFelipe Gonzalez' 6-year-old government to change its economicpolicies and meet demands for wage increases, unemployment benefitsand pensions.   The unions claim large groups among Spain's 38 million peoplehave not benefited from an economic boom that reversed once stagnantgrowth rate to 5 percent a year and dropped inflation nine points to5.1 percent.   But this has not dented Spain's 18.7 percent unemployment rate,the highest in Europe.   In Barcelona, the country's second largest city, police said some55,000 strikes marched in festive mood Wednesday evening.   Thousands of demonstrators also marched peacefully in Vigo,Gijon, Bilbao, Oviedo, Vitoria and Valencia.   Unions called a similar march for Friday in Madrid.   Gonzalez told a news conference Wednesday that he would not callearly elections because of the strike. General elections are due in1990.   Recent polls indicate if elections were held now, the Socialistswould win another majority. Polls also indicate 45 percent ofSpaniards felt the call for a general strike was justified.</TEXT></DOC>
