Sometime this summer, commission officials say, the SECwill seek public comment on a proposal that would forceinvestors to disclose when they have a short position of 5%or more of any company's stock. The plan would work like theSEC's 13D filings, in which investors must disclose when theyown 5% or more of a company's stock.</LP><TEXT>   Short-sellers, who bet that a stock will decline, borrowshares and immediately sell them. They eventually have topurchase the stock to return to the lender, but they profitif the company's stock price has fallen in the meantime.   Because short-sellers don't own a company's shares, theyhaven't had to make 13D filings and disclose big positions.Many companies, particularly smaller ones traded on theover-the-counter market, complain bitterly that short-sellersgang up on their stocks to force their prices down.   A group representing those companies, the Association ofPublicly Traded Companies, asked the SEC in 1989 to forceshort-sellers to disclose their positions. When that effortfell on deaf ears, the group sought legislative relief, but abill introduced in Congress last year went nowhere.   Now the SEC appears ready to reopen the issue. &quot;It'slogical,&quot; said SEC Chairman Richard Breeden in an interviewin Miami. &quot;Is it relevant to investors to know large shortpositions? It may be relevant.&quot;   It is far from clear whether the SEC is interested ingoing further than issuing a request for comment. SECofficials have been studying the issue for more than a year,and few seem to be convinced that the plan would offer muchprotection for shareholders.   That's because 13D filings typically tell investors that ashareholder or group has a big enough stake to considerforcing a change of control over a company. Any short-saledisclosure rule wouldn't provide the same information toinvestors because short-sellers can't control a company withborrowed stock. But it would tell investors and concernedcompanies which short-sellers have built up large shortpositions in their stock.   Short-sellers decried the proposal. &quot;This rule doesn'thave any other purpose than invading the privacy of a fewprofessional investors,&quot; said Joseph Feshbach, generalpartner of Feshbach Brothers, one of the nation's largestshort-sellers. &quot;It is simply a misdirected effort to cure astill {unproven} `abuse.'&quot;   Michael Steinhardt, a major New York money manager whooften shorts stocks, worries that any disclosure rule couldintroduce more abuses. He notes that traders who sell stocksshort are much more vulnerable than those investors whosimply buy stocks and put them away. The reason is that theshorts can often easily get hemmed in by a &quot;squeeze,&quot; inwhich a stock shoots up and they have trouble buying backshares to replace those they have borrowed. &quot;The {so-called}short-busters club is really a sad reflection on howdistorted some people can become in this business,&quot; Mr.Steinhardt said.   John Guion, president of the Association of PubliclyTraded Companies, said he is &quot;pleased the SEC is movingforward. I've long felt this issue needs a lot of lookingat.&quot; But he noted that the legislation unveiled last year byRep. Doug Barnard (D., Ga.) went further than just adding a5% short-sale disclosure rule. The bill, which may bereintroduced this year, included measures to protect holdersof manipulated stock, and to allow corporations to sueshort-sellers. &quot;The SEC may be a bit behind the times,&quot; hesaid.   SEC officials are busily studying the pros and cons of a5% disclosure rule for short-sellers. Proponents in andoutside the agency contend that such a rule would spotlightany short-seller who might be trying to force down acompany's stock. They note that disclosure is the basis ofU.S. securities laws, and that the SEC generally favorsrequiring disclosure of information that could be valuable toinvestors trying to make investment decisions.   But detractors counter that any such new rule could hurtlegitimate short-selling, which many SEC officials see asplaying a critical role in the markets. They say thatshort-selling provides a way for investors to bet onoverinflated stock prices, and provides an incentive for someinvestors to dig out bad news that companies haven'tdisclosed.   Some also fear the contemplated rule could provokeunnecessary short squeezes because companies that have alarge percentage of their stock shorted could take steps tohurt the shorts. For example, a company could contactshareholders and ask them to take possession of their stockcertificates from their brokers. Since only shares held atbrokerage houses can be shorted, that would make it difficultfor the shorts to replace their borrowed shares, resulting ina squeeze and driving the price of the stock higher.   Some SEC officials also argue that disclosure could hurtcompanies. That's because if high-profile short-selling firmsdisclosed their large short positions, it could lead copycatinvestors to follow suit.   Some SEC officials prefer other ways to resolve abuses inshort sales. &quot;If people are putting out false information tomake their short sales work better, we should be takingenforcement efforts against them,&quot; said Commissioner RichardRoberts.   Still, he and Mr. Breeden back the idea of hearing fromthe public about the disclosure proposal. &quot;You really neverknow until you get a reaction from the outside world,&quot; Mr.Roberts said. And Mr. Breeden said, &quot;We haven't given enoughattention to short-selling and the impact it has had. It'sworth considering that something like a 13D {filing} in along position in a stock should be considered in a shortposition.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
