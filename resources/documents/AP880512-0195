If the estimates are not revised during public review, thedepartment would show 37 percent less undiscovered oil and gas bothonshore and offshore compared with currently used figures.   Part of the lowered estimates result from the decline in crudeoil prices, which means small, high-cost reservoirs are droppedfrom the list of prospects because it doesn't pay to recover theoil and gas there.   Oil today costs about $18 a barrel, and the new estimates arebased on that price. In 1981, the price was almost double that.   Part of the decline, however, represents dry holes, notably inAlaska.   By coincidence, the new offshore estimates came the same day theEnergy Department released what it meant to be a cheery estimate ofthe nation's total natural gas reserves, discovered andundiscovered.   The Energy Department said these amount to a 35-year supply, 583trillion cubic feet, at current usage rates and a wellhead price of$3 per thousand cubic feet. The current price is $1.83.   In asking for industry and scientific comment on the newoffshore oil and gas estimates, the Interior Department declined tomake comparisons with existing figures. Officials said they wantedto emphasize by their reticence the tentative, subject-to-revisionnature of the estimates.   But simple arithmetic showed the offshore oil estimate off 27percent from the figure in current use and the gas estimate down 18percent: 8.9 billion barrels of oil compaired with 12.2 billionbarrels and 74 trillion cubic feet of gas compared with 90.5trillion cubic feet.   In March, preliminary new onshore estimates showed unrecoveredoil down 39 percent and gas down 41 percent: oil, 33.4 billionbarrels compared with 54.6 billion; gas, 254 trillion cubic feetcompared with 427 trillion cubic feet.   Combined, that means estimated oil remaining to be found droppedfrom 66.8 billion barrels to 42.3 billion and gas fell from 518trillion cubic feet to 328 trillion.   The current onshore figures were compiled in 1984 and themselvesrepresented reductions from 1981 estimates of 55 percent for oiland 44 percent for gas. Current onshore estimates were made in 1981.   Some offshore areas showed little change, but Alaska's federalwaters were almost wiped out as a promising place to look. The newestimates showed no gas at all there, compared with almost 14trillion cubic feet in 1984, and 900 million barrels of oilcompared with 3.3 billion.   Gas estimates for the Gulf of Mexico were raised, largelybecause of the extension of drilling to deeper water in recentyears: 64.3 trillion cubic feet compared with 59.6 trillion cubicfeet. The oil estimate was down slightly to 5.6 billion barrelsfrom 6.0 billion.   Pacific Coast oil estimates were about the same as before at 2.1billion barrels. Gas of 4.7 trillion cubic feet was down from 5.2trillion. The Atlantic Coast oil estimate was lowered from 680million barrels to 250 million and the gas estimate slashed from12.3 trillion cubic feet to 4.5 trillion.   A gas price of $5 would draw into the market only an additional10-year supply, 174 trillion cubic feet, the study said. This fiureand other estimates would be ``substantially larger'' if theanalysts had incorporated forseeable new technologies, but theystuck strictly with known technologies in the interest of beingconservative, said the study director, William L. Fisher.   The study made no price forecasts. The department's EnergyInformation Administration projects that gas will rise to only$2.85 in 1995 and $4.02 in 2000.   Nicholas Bush, president of the Natural Gas Supply Association,a producer group, said the Energy Department's findings were ``verypositive ones for producers and consumers alike.''   ``I think the study is deceptive,'' said Ed Rothschild,assistant director of the Citizen-Labor Energy Coalition, aconsumer advocacy group.   ``It doesn't look at gas at $2, which is a much more realisticprice, and when you do, there isn't as much gas there.''</TEXT></DOC>
