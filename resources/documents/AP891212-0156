(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Secretary of State Gentry Crowell, whoseoffice has been near the center of a federal probe into illegalbingo gambling and public corruption, was shot in the head Tuesdayin an apparent suicide attempt.   Doctors removed damaged brain tissue and the bullet lodged inhis skull during more than four hours of emergency surgery Tuesdayat Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Crowell was listed in verycritical condition.   ``The path that the bullet took is not one that would killone,'' said Dr. Joseph C. Ross, vice chancellor for health affairsat Vanderbilt University Medical Center.   Crowell was found by a son, Brooks, about 6:45 a.m. on the porchof his home in Lebanon, about 30 miles east of Nashville. Policesaid Crowell apparently shot himself once in the mouth with a.38-caliber revolver found next to his hand. He did not leave anote and police declined to speculate on any reason.   ``He had a gunshot wound with the bullet actually going up intothe brain. There was a lot of bleeding and it destroyed a lot oftissue,'' Ross said. ``It's impossible to know at this time whatresidual damage there might be.''   He said doctors are trying to reduce swelling around Crowell'sbrain and prevent infection.   Several Democratic legislators were waiting outside thehospital's neurological intensive care unit, where Crowell wastaken after surgery.   The reaction to Tuesday's shooting was one of shock on CapitolHill.   ``It's just terrible, a tragedy like this,'' Gov. Ned McWhertersaid. ``It's just unbelievable to me.''   McWherter, a former House speaker, and Crowell were closepolitically when Crowell's partisan chairing of the House CalendarCommittee earned him the name, ``The Godfather.''   Lt. Gov. John S. Wilder, near tears, declined to comment.   Sen. Robert Rochelle, a Democrat from Crowell's home town ofLebanon, called Crowell ``a private person who does not talk aboutthings. He doesn't talk about his problems.''   ``Depression is a terrible thing. I didn't realize that Gentryhad anything bothering him to that extent,'' said House Speaker EdMurray.   Crowell's wife, Terrijean, and son Brooks were the only familymembers at home when the shooting happened, police said. BrooksCrowell heard a shot and found his father outside. The couple alsohave two other children.   Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agents are probing theshooting to make sure foul play was not involved, said TBI DeputyDirector John Carney.   Crowell, 57, was elected secretary of state by the Legislaturein 1977 after serving four terms in the state House.   Crowell has testified twice before grand juries investigatingillegal bingo gambling and public corruption, including last monthin Memphis. He said then he had been assured by federalinvestigators they were not seeking an indictment against him.   Crowell has not been implicated in the probe, but one of hisformer employees is serving a prison term in connection with it.Another was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in connectionwith the operation of a Memphis bingo hall.   Twenty-two people have been indicted or pleaded guilty this yearin the investigation.   Bingo had been legal for charity purposes but reports showedthat fake charities often were set up to run the games and moneywas siphoned off illegally.   All permits for the game were revoked this year after theTennessee Supreme Court ruled that it was a lottery, in violationof the state constitution.   Under Tennessee law, the governor can appoint an interimreplacement for Crowell or wait for the Legislature to do so whenit convenes next month.   David Welles, McWherter's legal counsel, said the governor wouldprobably wait for the Legislature to act. The office will be run inthe meantime by Crowell's executive assistant.</TEXT></DOC>
