The non-militaryand non-communications satellites launched by the US, USSR, and the EuropeanCommunity produce digital images of the Earth's surface and its atmosphere.These images are used to search for undiscovered mineral resources, toconduct population, land use and resource censuses, to control pestsand pollution, to illustrate weather movements on television and muchmore. This introductory book examines the physical basis of remote sensing-thesensors and satellites used to collect data, and the methods used toprocess these data as well as the application of satellite remote sensingin the study of vegetation, land use, geology, soils, the atmosphereand the hydrosphere. The last chapter looks at the future: space stations,international coordination, etc.</TEXT></DOC>
