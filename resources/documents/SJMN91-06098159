Can you write of its beginnings?;    A: The band wasformed as The Big Thin in 1968, then changed its moniker to Chicago TransitAuthority. Later, the group dropped the last part of its name becauseofficials got touchy about a pop band going under the title of the city's masstransportation system, and Mayor Richard Daley initiated legal action to forcethe change.;    Q: I heard Marlo Thomas has a brother in acting.
