David Chon, research analyst at theConference Board, said he is expecting economic performancegrowth rates to continue to decline, given the readings fromthe leading index and the trend in North America. Bothindexes, which are based on information gathered fromNovember, are part of the International Economic Scoreboardat the Conference Board, a nonprofit industry-supportedgroup.   &quot;While the threat of world-wide recession is mounting, theinflation threat is easing, largely because most of lastsummer's bulge in oil prices has passed through the system,&quot;said Edgar R. Fiedler, vice president and economic counselorat the board. But he noted that inflation accelerated overthe past three months in Canada and Australia, two nationsthat are in recession.   The survey found the index of leading indicators in theU.S., which is clearly in recession, down 5% from theprevious three months.   Two nations bucking the trend are Germany, whose leadingindex is growing at an annual rate of 7%, and South Korea,where the leading index is growing at a 6% rate. South Koreawas a &quot;notable exception to the economic buffeting otherPacific nations are experiencing,&quot; the board said. Taiwan'sleading index is declining at a 1% pace, while Japan's isfalling by 2%. The index is declining by 5% in Australia and6% in New Zealand.   The board said Europe's cyclical pattern is healthy incomparison with the rest of the world. France's leading indexis rising at a 1% pace.
