The nation's largest securities firm said it is seeking more stable rates than those pegged to the &quot;broker call rate,&quot; a base rate that banks use in lending money to securities firms for short-term loans backed by securities. The new rate may be slightly higher or lower than the broker call rate, Merrill officials said. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., another major securities firm, has for some time taken steps to ease margin-rate fluctuation.    For years, Merrill Lynch and other major brokerages have pegged their lending rates to the broker call rate. Brokerage firms generally charge their best customers three-quarters of a percentage point more than the broker call rate -- currently 7.75% annually -- on loans for anything from buying stock to financing a vacation. Customers with small or inactive margin accounts generally pay as high as 2 1/2 points over the broker call rate.    Merrill Lynch officials said that for competitive reasons they won't disclose their formula for calculating the rate. The company said the new rate would be available to investors through their Merrill brokers at any time, and the previous month's rates would also be disclosed on customers' monthly statements, as is industry practice.    Regarding the question of rate stability, Merrill Lynch officials said the broker call rate has fluctuated dramatically in recent years. Charles A. Humm, a vice president in the firm's credit management group, said that from April 25 to May 5 the broker call rate, which is quoted by six major New York banks, fluctuated between 7.5% and 8.75%.    An executive at another major securities firm, who asked not to be identified, said his firm also intends to change its margin lending policy this fall because of the volatility of the broker call rate. But unlike Merrill Lynch, the firm will charge customers an interest rate based on a monthly average of the daily broker call rate.    Shearson Lehman already uses such a monthly average rate.    The new rate's advantage to investors, Merrill Lynch officials said, is that it will fluctuate less often than the broker call rate. Merrill Lynch added that the new rate would change no more than once a week. If the new formula had been used during the April 25-May 5 volatile period, Merrill Lynch's base rate would have remained at 7.75% throughout, according to Mr. Humm.    But because Merrill Lynch's formula is secret, competitors privately wondered how customers could be sure that brokers would be quoting them the correct rate. &quot;The broker call rate is published every day,&quot; said a rival executive. &quot;If you start developing a new rate, how can investors tell if they're getting charged the proper rate?&quot;    Merrill Lynch's Mr. Humm countered that an investor could run into the same problem at another firm if a broker quoted a rate of three-quarters of a percentage point above the broker call rate, when the actual rate was 2 1/4 points over the broker rate.    Merrill Lynch's move to stabilize interest rates on broker loans is part of a broader industry effort to get more customers to borrow. Margin lending &quot;is extremely profitable&quot; to brokerage houses, because there are few costs other than the cost of funds, said Perrin Long, an analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.    Merrill Lynch attributed 5.6% of its revenue last year, or $533.4 million, to interest from margin lending.    The amount of margin lending is rising as firms put more emphasis on these loans. PaineWebber Group Inc. has made about $200 million in margin loans for nonsecurities purchases since it began offering such loans in April 1985. The New York Stock Exchange said customer margin debt at member firms totaled $40.2 billion at the end of July, compared with $32.5 billion a year earlier.    Still, securities officials say that less than 10% of all securities customers use margin debt. Some are deterred by the use of the broker call rate, which isn't familiar to investors, in contrast to banks' prime rate, for example.    Investors &quot;don't know what a broker call rate is,&quot; said the president of one major retail firm. &quot;It would be nice if we could come up with a replacement, but we haven't.&quot;    The term &quot;margin&quot; also reminds many investors of the great crash of 1929, when unregulated margin buying left many investors unable to cover their debts when the market turned down. To counter this reluctance, Merrill Lynch is planning to introduce a new name for margin borrowing, sources at the firm say. The company said there are &quot;more enhancements&quot; scheduled for its margin lending program, but declined to elaborate.    Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, which govern margin lending, customers currently can borrow as much as 50% of the value of the stock they put up as collateral. </TEXT></DOC>
