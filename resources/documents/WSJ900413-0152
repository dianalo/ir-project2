In &quot;A Law Unto Itself: Power, Politics and the IRS&quot;(Random House, 419 pages, $22.50), author David Burnhamprovides copious details on how the IRS, with its 123,000employees, keeps tabs on the nation's 152 million taxpayerswho fork up $1 trillion a year to pay ever-increasinggovernment bills. And almost four million IRS notices assessan added $1.8 billion a year on underreported income.</LP><TEXT>   Some stories about IRS assessments are terrifying. Takethe Husbys of San Francisco, who were asked for added taxesin 1986. The couple took the case to Tax Court, but acomputerized IRS service center in Ogdon, Utah, stilldemanded payment.   The Husbys' attorney complained, saying the petition tothe Tax Court made the second IRS demand illegal. But a thirdarrived, then two more.   A year later, an IRS notice of levy was sent to the creditunion of the police department from which Mr. Husby hadretired, seizing almost $3,800. Another notice was served onthe couple's stockbroker. Even after a federal judge enjoinedthe IRS from further notices, a tax lien wound up in publicfiles. Credit for the couple dried up.   The IRS contended that it wasn't liable for its computers'mistakes since such errors rarely occur. But Mr. Burnham sayssuch IRS computer errors &quot;continue to affect an unknownnumber of other taxpayers.&quot;   Bureaucratic gaffes apparently are more common than theIRS would like the public to believe. For example, thisreviewer recently wrote in this newspaper about an accountantwho was enrolled by an overzealous IRS agent to inform on hisclient for five years -- to the outrage of other accountantswho fear this disclosure may lose them tax clients. Theaccountant had failed to pay his own taxes but was neverprosecuted.   The IRS sometimes ends up wasting its efforts and funds onseemingly nonproductive targets, according to Mr. Burnham, aformer investigative reporter for the New York Times.Consider that the service had to take a Billings, Mont.,taxpayer to an appeals court before it could collect an extra$500 assessment. The taxpayer apparently had violated anobscure section of the tax law prohibiting &quot;frivolous&quot;comment on the return. The scribbled comment: &quot;Signedinvoluntarily under the penalty of statutory punishment.&quot;   Mr. Burnham is at his best relating anecdotes aboutgovernment ineptitude, incompetence or pigheadedness. But hisbook bogs down when it strings out barely related facts. Forexample, most readers may find it hard to resist yawning whenMr. Burnham tells how the IRS and state organizationsexchange tax data.   Even in some of its most gripping sections, the book tendsto be skimpy on certain key details. For example, it relateshow the IRS began investigating the National Council ofChurches in the late 1960s because of its civil-rights andanti-Vietnam War activities.   The investigation ended in 1972 but not until thecouncil's business records for at least three years werescrutinized by the IRS. The church group told Mr. Burnhamthat &quot;a particular conservative senator,&quot; disturbed at thecouncil's political stands, had gotten the IRS to harass thecouncil. The senator isn't identified nor does the readerlearn how he got the IRS to do his handiwork. As it turnsout, the IRS concluded that only 8% of the council's fundshad been used for allegedly non-tax-exempt activities. Andthis didn't justify raising the council's tax bill.   IRS attempts to enforce evenhanded treatment of tax-exemptand religious organizations have been less than fruitful,according to Mr. Burnham. For example, pro-choice groups havelong contended that the Catholic Church has avoided IRS taxpenalties despite its spending funds to oppose abortion -- apolitical activity that the groups say shouldn't betax-exempt under the law. But Mr. Burnham says that &quot;giventhe power of the Roman Catholic Church, it is inconceivablethat the IRS would revoke its tax-exempt status, no matterwhat it did.&quot;   Individual taxpayers, on the other hand, often fall intothe trap of thinking the IRS loves them too, because theymistakenly see their tax refunds as a gift instead of abyproduct of overwithholding. Mr. Burnham notes, for example,that in a recent year, the IRS paid out an average of $800 tofour out of five individual taxpayers. Adds Mr. Burnham:&quot;Because the withholding process is almost invisible, and therefund check so visible . . . a substantial number oftaxpayers gradually have abandoned the essentially correctpicture of the agency as a hard-nosed tax collector and haveadopted the false view that the IRS is a benevolentbureaucracy that gives away money to the needy middle class.&quot;   Although Mr. Burnham doesn't flesh out some sections ofhis book enough, the reader will still find it hard to putdown once he's begun. As tax day approaches next week, we allwant to know more about the agency that pinches ourpocketbook.   ---   Mr. Berton covers accounting in the Journal's New Yorkbureau.</TEXT></DOC>
