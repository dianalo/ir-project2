Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the mediator in previous talksand an observer to the Monday discussions, expressed a hint ofpessimism about their outcome.   ``I see the situation as quite complicated,'' he said during hisSunday homily. ``It is very difficult to reconcile two things thatare completely opposite.''   The negotiations were scheduled for the southern border post ofSapoa, 90 miles south of the capital near the Costa Rican border.   The Honduran bombings Thursday and Saturday along the isolatednorthern border were aimed at retaliating for an alleged Sandinistatroop incursion last week into Honduras to chase Contra rebels.There were no reported casualties in the air attacks.   ``The Nicaraguan troops are now in Nicaraguan territory in theborder area,'' Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco said at anews conference Sunday, suggesting that the army had crossed theborder. ``We can't retreat from the border area, because we can'tabandon our right to defend our national territory.''   He denied reports that the Sandinista troops remained insideHonduran territory, calling them a lie by the Reagan administration``to obtain more money for the Contras.''   The rebels have been fighting the government since Nov. 1981 ina conflict that has killed more than 40,000 people. The cease-firetalks are included in a regional peace plan signed in August by thepresidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and CostaRica. The pact calls for amnesty, democratic reforms and an end tosupport for insurgencies.   Tinoco said Monday's talks will center on finding a way for therebels to lay down their arms. The government delegation will beheaded by the nation's top military leader, Gen. Humberto Ortega,brother of President Daniel Ortega.   The Contras say the talks should include political issues. Theirtop delegate will be the rebels' leading political leader, AdolfoCalero.   The Sandinista newspaper Barricada repeated its call Sunday forNicaraguans to maintain a state of alert in the face of Honduranbombs and American troops.   ``The way the Honduran government borrows Yankee planes toprovoke an incident could serve as a pretext for a directinvasion,'' the paper said in an editorial.</TEXT></DOC>
