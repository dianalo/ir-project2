SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Clouds could prove to be a built-in thermostatfor the Earth, cooling things down to counter the threatenedgreenhouse warming, a group of scientists report.   But while researchers attending a meeting of the AmericanGeophysical Union agreed Thursday that such a balancing ispossible, they refused to predict that it will actually take place.   ``Lets be very careful about that. We don't know that, as theclimate warms up with the greenhouse effect, these clouds are goingto increase and compensate for it...don't jump to anyconclusions,'' cautioned Bruce A. Albrecht of Penn State University.   The threat of rising temperatures has attracted considerableattention recently. Many climatologists worry that increasinglevels of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere willraise the planet's average temperature by trapping excess heat fromthe sun that would ordinarily be radiated back into space.   The panel of scientists reporting early results from aninternational cloud research project said they found that someclouds add to the greenhouse warming while others reduce it. Even asmall change in the amount of cloud cover can have a major impact,they said.   The apparently helpful clouds are the stratocumulus, large decksof white clouds that form at relatively low levels in theatmosphere and are widely seen, especially over the oceans.   ``The way these clouds work, they are highly reflective in theshort wave but they have very little effect on the long-waveradiation,'' Albrecht explained. Thus, short-wave radiationarriving from the sun that would ordinarily warm the surface of theplanet gets reflected back out into space, while long-waveradiation cooling the earth isn't blocked from leaving.   The clouds' effectiveness increases if they contain more wateror if they consist of smaller droplets, the researchers said.   ``If the climate warms and the amount of liquid water in thecloud increases, that can lead to more reflecting clouds. Morereflecting clouds means that the total amount of energy availableto the Earth's energy system is reduced,'' explained Tony Slingo ofthe National Center for Atmospheric Research.   ``That acts as a thermostat, bringing the climate back intoequilibrium,'' he said.   ``The sensitivity of climate to clouds is so enormous that youreally need only very modest changes in particle size and you canwipe out the (carbon dioxide) warming. Now, whether those processreally are operating and they really are wiping out the ...warming'' remains a question, he added.   While he, too, was cautious about predicting what will happen,Penn State's Albrecht agreed that the stratocumulus clouds can havea major effect on cooling the atmosphere.   ``The number that we toss around ... if you increase the amountof stratocumulus by 4 percent'' that would be enough to compensatefor a doubling of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,'' he said.   On the other hand, cirrus clouds, those high wispy ones that arehard to see, actually add warmth to the Earth by trapping heat fromthe sun in much the same way that carbon dioxide and otherso-called Greenhouse gases do, explained David Starr of theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration.   These clouds are the most common type, covering 25 percent to 40percent of the Earth's surface, Starr said.   ``The importance of cirrus clouds to climate is similar to thatof the greenhouse gases,'' added Howard Hanson of the University ofColorado at Boulder.   Recent cloud studies have convinced researchers that the effectsof clouds are much more complex than they had previously thought,Hanson said.   Cirrus clouds are not well understood and are difficult tostudy, Starr said, although scientists are trying to learn more.   Government and scientific attention to the theory of greenhousewarming has been widespread. Some researchers warn that risingtemperatures could severely disrupt climate and weather, changecrop yields and even cause coastal flooding by melting the polarice caps.   Some reports have indicated a slight rise in averagetemperatures over the last century, a time when industrializationhas added large amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.</TEXT></DOC>
