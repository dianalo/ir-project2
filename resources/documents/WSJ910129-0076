Mr. Pasche said the companies in question were especiallyactive in the field of nuclear, biological, and chemicalweapons, as well as missile technology. He said Swissofficials have limited authority to act against the export ofarmament technology, adding that the executive branch hasnevertheless intervened in some cases.   Most companies that have coordinated or financed armamentdeals have gone unpunished, Mr. Pasche said.   Martin Erb, a spokesman for the Swiss Association ofMachinery Manufacturers, said the association was unware ofany Swiss companies that are alleged to have exported weaponstechnology to Iraq. He acknowledged, however, that Swissmachine-tool companies have seen their sales drop sharplysince the United Nations imposed a trade embargo against Iraqand occupied Kuwait.                                                                                                          ONLY MILLIONAIRES NEED APPLY                                                                                                          Five companies bid an average of 243.8 million baht ($9.7million) each to secure seats on the Securities Exchange ofThailand. &quot;Not only were the prices paid astronomical, butnone of the winners were names I immediately recognized asbeing prominent&quot; in the brokerage community, one Thai analystsaid. The winning bids were about five times what was paidtwo years ago when the exchange last auctioned seats.                                                                                                          AMOCO, CHINA SIGN AGREEMENT                                                                                                          The U.S.'s Amoco Corp. signed an agreement with China todevelop an oil field at the mouth of the Pearl River. TheXinhua news agency said Amoco and state-owned China NationalOffshore Oil Corp. would form a joint venture to extract theoil. Total investment of $500 million is planned, and thefield is expected to become fully operational in 1995,producing about 50,000 barrels a day, Xinhua said.                                                                                                          GERMANY'S BEER BOOM                                                                                                          Western Germany's brewers increased their beer deliveriesby 12.1% in 1990 to a record high 104.3 million hectoliters,buoyed by consumption in eastern Germany, the FederalStatistics Office reported. Figures for eastern Germanbrewers weren't reported. Last year's demand was said to befueled in part by the very warm summer in Germany.                                                                                                          BILLIONS FOR TECHNOLOGY                                                                                                          South Korea will provide $2.1 billion in grants and loansover five years to help industries develop manufacturingtechnology, the Trade and Industry Ministry reported. Thegovernment will give priority to helping manufacturersrestore lost competitiveness in the area of exports. SouthKorea lags particularly in high technology for electronics,new materials, bioengineering and aerospace.                                                                                                          ITALY'S CAPITAL-GAINS DECREE                                                                                                          The Italian cabinet approved a long-awaited decree settingout how a new capital-gains tax on stock-market transactionswill operate. The tax takes effect immediately. Investors canchoose either an automatic deduction of the tax by brokers atthe time of a transaction or a system under which theydeclare share sales on their own income-tax forms at yearend. The tax rate under the former method is 20%; it is 25%if payment is delayed until income-tax declaration.                                                                                                          BEIJING'S LATEST FIVE-YEAR PLAN                                                                                                          China will likely pursue a muddled economic policy in thenear term to placate both conservatives and liberals as ittries to uphold a fragile political stability.   That is the picture that emerges from the guidelines onChina's eighth Five-Year Plan. The guidelines were approvedby the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee on Dec. 30but weren't made public until yesterday.   The blueprint is marked by compromise, contradictions andlack of clear objectives. Although the overall tone isconciliatory to conservatives who favor a return to centralplanning, the document actually endorses most of the existingfeatures of reforms. &quot;It's a supermarket of policy choices,&quot;says a Western diplomat in Hong Kong who tracks China.   The biggest contradiction perhaps comes in calls forpolitical reform. The document says efforts will be made to&quot;uphold and improve the system of people's congresses and thesystem of multiparty cooperation and political consultationunder the leadership of the Communist Party.&quot; But as onepolitical analyst notes, &quot;How can democracy function if onehas to resolutely uphold the Communist Party?&quot;                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          South Korea exported 10,064 cars, trucks and buses toEastern Europe, China and Vietnam last year, up 183% from1989, the auto industry reported. Korean motor companiesfirst began to market their vehicles in communist countriesin 1989, under a government policy encouraging trade with theEast bloc. . . . Kikkoman Corp., Japan's largest soy-saucemaker, said it would buy a 20% equity share of a Frenchwinegrower and begin participating in its management from theend of this month. The purchase of the shares of Amann VinsS.A., located in the Beaujolais area, cost a little less thanone billion yen ($7.5 million), Kikkoman officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
