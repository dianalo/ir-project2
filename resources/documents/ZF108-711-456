(products).andO;Product:   Shiva Telebridge with Dial-In Network Access 3.5 (Turnkey system).andO;Topic:     EvaluationCommunications SoftwareTurnkey SystemsBridges (Connector)Modems.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Shiva Corp.andM;TELEBRIDGE WITH DIAL-IN NETWORK ACCESSandM;Shiva makes many products that use its Dial-In Network Access software tooffer remote access to a Macintosh network.andP;  The TeleBridge with Dial-InNetwork Access approach differs greatly from Farallon's and Microcom'sremote-access products, because it ties two LocalTalk networks together.andO;Shiva's software works only with its networking hardware.andM;The TeleBridge bridge allows any modem attached to it to be shared by anyoneon the Apple network, while also providing Dial-In Network Access capability.andO;The TeleBridge, therefore, becomes a network resource.andM;Since the TeleBridge only provides a network connection, the Mac user mustalso purchase networking software such as TOPS or Apple's AppleShare forfile-transfer capabilities, and remote-control software to control anotherMac on the network.andM;If both file-transfer and remote-control features are required, buyers shouldgo with Timbuktu/Remote, which is cheaper, or Carbon Copy Mac, which ischeaper and provides the fastest file transfers of the three tested products.andO;However, if the Mac user needs only LAN access for an E-mail server, orremote LAN access, then Dial-In Network Access works well.andM;Installing the TeleBridge requires a significant amount of LAN expertise tomake correct decisions about network addresses, especially on largeinternets.andM;Although TeleBridge shows how flexible a LAN product can be, thedocumentation is difficult to navigate, because the bridge can be used in somany different ways.andP;  Many users will have to skip around to find all theinformation they need.andM;Dial-In Network Access provided the second fastest TOPS file transfer amongthese products (see the file-transfer results listed above).andP;  To accomplish afile transfer, users select the Dial-In Network Access product from theChooser under the Apple menu.andP;  Dial-In Network Access then turns off thelocal network connection and pushes AppleTalk over the communicationsconnection.andM;One drawback to this approach is that local printing is suspended during theremote session.andM;Shiva's products were rated higher in the Scoreboard for reliability becausethey handle line problems more adeptly.andP;  When Dial-In Network Accessdisconnects because of a line problem, it displays a message indicating thatit shut down, then automatically reconnects when the Mac is &quot;restarted.&quot;andO;Timbuktu/Remote and Carbon Copy Mac merely inform users that a communicationserror has occurred.andM;Shiva Corp., in Cambridge, Mass., can be contacted at (617) 864-8500 or (800)458-3550.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;&quot;It was a three-hoop job to keep the thing running,&quot; said Steven Passman,support engineer for new products at Mac reseller Alliance Computer Inc. inHighland Park, Ill.andP;  &quot;You have to remember to install and activate AppleShareon the remote system and, before you call up, you have to call onAppleShare.&quot;andM;Also, he said, &quot;When you set it up, they give you an option of 10 modemtypes.andP;  If you have a modem that falls outside [of that list of modems], youhave to dial manually instead of relying on the automatic dialing.&quot;andM;Passman found that Dial-In Network Access has an easy-to-use interface.andP;  &quot;Ithas the complete Apple look and feel,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Once you dial in,everything is automatic.andP;  When you go to the Chooser, you can bring theAppleShare server up remotely, but it is the same metaphor -- point, clickand drag methodology.&quot;andM;Brad Bernosky, director of MIS at the headquarters of Environmental ResourceManagement Inc., in Exton, Pa., uses Dial-In Network Access to transferinformation among the company's 47 branches located across the country.andM;Bernosky praised the product's ease of use.andP;  &quot;We can teach our users how touse it, and we don't have to go back and keep helping them,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It isself-explanatory.&quot;andM;However, he added, &quot;I would like to have a utility to speed up thefile-transfer process -- it is very slow.&quot;andM;Tim Brown, computer services analyst at the Business School of EmoryUniversity in Atlanta, said he is pleased with the product.andP;  &quot;It has beenvery reliable,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;In particular, I like the feedback on the modemoperation that you get when you are dialing out.andP;  You get a picture of themodem on the screen, so you can track its progress.&quot;andM;It can be intriguing when a function one expects to find in a product is notincluded.andM;After using PC-based remote-access software, for example, users might expectto find a similar set of functions provided by Macintosh remote-accesssoftware developers.andP;  However, no remote-printing functions are available inany of the three Macintosh products tested.andM;PC Week asked representatives from Farallon Computing Inc., Microcom Inc. andShiva Corp. to ponder this apparent weakness in their products and to suggestthe reasoning behind this exclusion.andP;  They responded with several answers.andM;One company's spokesperson said that, because many users operate at 2,400bps, adding a print stream to this load would further reduce the usability ofits product.andM;According to another company's spokesperson, the print stream from aMacintosh to a LaserWriter contained so much information (PostScript bepraised?) that users would not want to wait for the page to appear.andM;Several of the company representatives contacted suggested that the host filebe copied or moved to the guest machine and printed there.andP;  This is probablya workable solution for small graphics files, but for larger files, thetransfer time would be nearly as great as the time required to print throughthe remote link.andM;Until a Macintosh contains a file too large to be transferred and printed,however, it is easier to simply move the file that needs to be printed.andM;Many reports from databases, such as a bill of materials for a PC, print onjust a few pages.andP;  In this application, only two pages of text are sent tothe guest from the host.andM;Perhaps too few large, shared databases reside on Macintoshes to requireremote printing in remote-access products.andP;  In any case, software developerscan be sure that if they include remote-printing capabilities in a Macintoshremote-access product, the program will stand out from the others currentlyavailable.andP;
