(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>FROM IMS OR NON-IBM, THE MOVE IS ON TO DB2andM;Along with the move to relational database management systems in commercialdata processing has come the need to convert from older DBMS and filestructures.andM;The move to a relational database in many cases may drive an operating systemconversion, such as from IBM's DOS/VSE to MVS.andP;  That has been the case formany such conversions recently, according to a spokesman for the ComputerTask Group, Orchard Park, New York, which specializes in systems integrationwork.andM;Terry Warren, manager of the Cortex operating system conversion tool at CTG,said, &quot;DOS/VSE people migrating to MVS are establishing a foundation fordatabase conversion.andP;  They're looking at relational futures.andP;  Basically,we're positioning clients for database conversions.&quot;andM;Users contemplating database conversions generally find themselves in one oftwo situations.andP;  Some try to get from sequential or flat file systems to adatabase manager of some type.andP;  Most, however, are moving from an existingdatabase manager, especially older hierarchical or network systems, to aRDBMS.andM;Most conversions in the latter category can be further subdivided into twogroups: users moving from non-IBM systems to DB2, IBM's relational database;and users moving from IMS, IBM's hierarchical database, to DB2.andM;Business needs are driving the trend to convert to relational systems.andO;Partly, the notion results from a belief that an enterprise-wide view of acorporation's data, considered essential today, may sit on a relationaldatabase foundation.andM;&quot;People have to get their arms around the data,&quot; says Dean Mohlstrom,president and CEO of Information Engineering Systems Corp., a Dallas-basedconsultant.andP;  &quot;They need to get a handle on the company's informationresources.andP;  They need to structure their data so they can obtain theinformation they need to run the business.&quot;andM;Taking a five-year view, businesses should convert now to be in good shapefor the future, Mohlstrom says.andM;Increasingly, users are embracing relational database technology, with itsextensibility, ease of use and ease of maintenance, as the means to achievethat goal.andM;&quot;Users are looking to take advantage of new technooogy, like SQL (StructuredQuery Language),&quot; says Dick Manasseri, DB2 product manager at BachmanInformation Systems, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.andP;  &quot;The only way they'll be able totake advantage of that technology is on top of a relational system.&quot;andM;For example, as many corporations try to distribute their businesses to getcloser to their customers, they'll also need to distribute their databases.andO;&quot;They won't be able to do that without moving to a relational system first,&quot;Manasseri maintains.andM;For IBM shops, another concern pushing conversions to relational systems,specifically DB2, is the ability to participate in IBM's Systems ApplicationArchitecture.andP;  &quot;To take advantage of SAA--running the same applications onmultiple platforms, from mainframes down to PCs, and participating incooperative processing--the underlying assumption is that you're on arelational system,&quot; Manasseri says.andM;But database conversions of any type, especially conversions to a relationalsystem, are far from easy.andM;&quot;Conversion can be very tough, depending on the structure of the database,&quot;says Matt Dombrowski, marketing manager, Interactive Systems, Inc., Lowell,Mass., maker of Clone, a syntax translator.andM;Moving a heavily networked, hierarchical system to a relational system isdifficult because hierarchical systems tie &quot;child&quot; records to &quot;parent&quot;records, whereas relational systems' tabular structure relates records byvalues in fields, Dombroski explained.andM;&quot;The difficulty in database conversion is that it revolves around thedatabase design and existing technology,&quot; says Mike Niemann, specialty groupmanager for DB2 support services at Computer Task Group.andP;  &quot;The existingdatabase design may be inelegant, having evolved over 10 or 12 yearsMigration represents an opportunity to start over and do it right.&quot;andP;  Mostconversions he sees are from non-IBM databases to IBM's DB2.andM;There are generally two extremes to database migration, Niemann says.andO;&quot;Either customers say, 'Take what we've got and reproduce it exactly in thenew environment,' or 'Here's our current .andP;  .  .  portfolio and databasedesign.andP;  Help us decide what it should be to support our needs for the nextfive years.&quot;andM;APPROACHES TO CONVERSIONSandM;There are several approaches to database conversions.andP;  These includerewriting, re-engineering, reverse engineering and the use of bridgingtechnologies.andP;  Rewriting applications to the new database, the mosttime-consuming approach, is generally chosen only when no other alternativeis feasible, or when business needs demand it.andM;Re-engineering refers to work done to an existing system to improve itsstructure, such as eliminating redundancies and standardizing datadefinitions.andP;  Reverse engineering refers to the extraction of designspecifications from an existing application.andM;&quot;If we're going to do a database conversion from a flat file to IMS, or moretypically today, go from a hierarchical to a relational system, such as IMSto DB2, we apply logical data modeling techniques to get a normalized datamodel--how the data should be implemented and accessed,&quot; says William Ulrich.andM;Ulrich is director of re-engineering products at Peat Marwick AdvancedTechnology, Chicago, whose software division was acquired by XA Systems ofLos Gatos, Calif., in June.andM;&quot;We also glean data definitions from the current system.andP;  These definitionscontain information about how the data is used and accessed as well asdefined.andP;  We call this a 'bottom-up' approach.andP;  If the data definitions arewrong, they must be adjusted, but if they're right, we save a lot of time,&quot;Ulrich said.andM;Peat Marwick offers several automated tools to aid in conversion efforts.andO;DataTEC-EA (Environmental Analyzer) is used to caputer a picture of theexisting database's source code and file relationships.andP;  The next step is tocapture Cobol code.andP;  DataTEC-DS (Data Definition Standardization) capturesall record or file layouts and arranges them into logical groupings.andM;As a next step, PMAT offers Silverrun, which creates entity-relationship datamodels.andP;  Silverrun takes those Cobol record definitions as input into theentity relationship model and bring them down to the data model.andP;  &quot;Then you'dgo through the process of normalizing the date model,&quot; Ulrich said.andM;Peat Marwick is also developing a reverse engineering repository.andP;  Therepository will be a logical representation of an existing database.andP;  Bothdata definitions and process rules would be fed into the representation, andthen ported into forward engineering tools like Case products.andP;  Therepository is about a year away from availability.andM;The Personal Financial Security Division of Aetna Life andamp; Casualty inHartford, Conn., is using DataTEC-DS to help it convert from a 20-year-oldtape sequential database system to a relational system.andP;  The database, calledClaim Data File (CDF), runs on an  Amdahl 5890 mainframe and comprises 100million records of automobile, homeowner and personal claims.andP;  The systemprocesses 750,000 to 1 million transactions per month.andM;&quot;It's a very good, functional system, but we need to take that system intothe next century,&quot; says Bruce Skivington, director of home office claimprocessing systems.andP;  &quot;And when it comes to defining data sources in differentways for different uses, relational is the future.&quot;andM;Aetna began using DataTEC-DS in August 1988 to go through CDF's source codeand identify key record structures.andP;  &quot;DataTEC-DS assembles different localviews of a given record to form a composite view,&quot; says Thomas Wheeler,senior systems engineer.andP;  &quot;It allows you to standardize data names throughall different key records.andP;  This would be a mammoth undertaking if we had todo it manually.&quot;andM;Skivington says, &quot;Using DataTEC-DS to normalize our data, we've cut thenumber of data elements from 15,000 to 4,000.andP;  It allows us to do the datamodeling necessary to move toward relational.&quot;andM;Aetna plans to use DataTEC-EA to create its data dictionaries and isevaluating relational databases.andM;&quot;We could have rebuilt the system the traditional way--writing newspecifications, redesigning and then rebuilding--but we couldn't afford it interms of people, time or money,&quot; Skiving said.andP;  &quot;This approach allows us tointegrate systems and data at a price we can afford.&quot;andM;Bachman Information Systems, Inc., Cambridge, Mass., offers severalre-engineering and reverse engineering products that do database and datamodeling design, which can also be used in database conversions.andP;  Theflagship product is Bachman/Database Administrator (DB2), a database designtool geared to DB2.andP;  A version is also available for IDMS.andM;Using the Database Administrator, existing physical files or designs can bereverse-engineered for use within Bachman's Data Analyst product.andP;  Thatproduct is used to create a data model, which can then be used to&quot;forward-engineer&quot; the data model into a DB2 design.andM;The vendor also offers DA Capture (Files) for migrating Vsam and sequentialfiles to IDMS or DB2, and DA Capture (IMS), which performs the same functionfor IMS.andM;Another conversion option is to bridge technologies, to create what some call&quot;transparencies.&quot;andP;  These allow users to run existing applications againsttheir old database system, while migrating data into the new databasestructure.andM;Essentially, the bridges translate the old system's calls to those of the newsystem.andP;  The old applications run unchanged under the new system, withoutrewriting.andM;Software AG of North America, Inc., Reston, Va., maker of Adabas, offersthree bridges to its database: DL1/IMS, Vsam and Total.andM;Bridges can be either permanent or interim solutions, says Doug Henrich,product manager for the Natural 4GL, also a Software AG product, and bridgingtechnologies.andP;  &quot;Half of our customers use them as long-term,production-oriented tools, and never rewrite their applications.andP;  The otherhalf rewrite their applications for a relational system, especially thosemoving away from IMS.&quot;andM;Why use a bridge?andP;  &quot;For static applications that are just fine the way theyare, why rewrite?&quot;andP;  asks Henrich.andM;Bridge products allow users to maintain their investments in existingtechnology.andP;  However, strategic applications warrant the time and trouble toredesign and rewrite, Henrich notes.andM;The use of transparencies may result in a performance trade-off, but this isfrequently offset by the advantages of moving to the new database, saidHenrich.andM;Leroy Jones, director of data processing for Tulsa County, Okla., usesSoftware AG's Vsam Bridge to link three county offices--the treasurer,assessor and county clerk.andP;  The county runs two IBM 4341s and one 4381, alltied together under DOS/VSE.andM;Three years ago, Jones brought in Adabas.andP;  &quot;Each office wanted access to theother's data,&quot; Jones explains, &quot;but it would have taken five man-years toconvert our Vsam files.&quot;andM;The solution is still workable today, Jones says.andP;  &quot;Access time isn'tdegraded at all, even though we added overhead.&quot;andM;Cost is also a factor.andP;  Vsam Bridge costs about $40,000, Jones says, but atotal conversion project would cost $750,000, he estimates.andM;Computer Associates International, Inc., Garden City, N.Y., offers threeproducts--Vsam Transparency, DL1 Transparency and Total Transparency--for itsDatacom/DB database.andP;  &quot;Transparencies lay a foundation for using data moreintelligently,&quot; says Orrin Stevens, product analyst for CA-Datacom.andM;&quot;Earlier data access methods were marked by a high level of difficulty.andP;  Bymoving it into a table-oriented relational environment, data becomes part ofthe corporate information resource,&quot; Stevens said.andM;Bruce Conforto, director of information services at American Olean Tile Co.,andO;a wholly owned subsidiary of Armstrong Industries in Lansdale, Pa., uses bothDL1 Transparency and Vsam Transparency.andP;  The company runs an IBM 3090 120 Eunder VM and DOS/VSE SP 3.2.andM;&quot;When it comes to databases, it's clear that relational technology issuperior to any other,&quot; Conforto says.andP;  &quot;It's far easier to add a new columnor field.andP;  In the old days, to describe a larger field in a flat file or Vsamfile, we'd have to recompile all the programs using that file.andP;  With arelational system, we can have different views of different tables withoutwriting new programs.andM;&quot;Rewriting applications is a good thing to do, but we can't necessarilyafford to do that,&quot; Conforto continues.andP;  &quot;We have to spend our time workingon things that add value to the business.andP;  Recreating a database doesn't dothat.&quot;andM;The transparencies allow Conforto to convert the system to native Datacom/DBover time.andP;  &quot;We can redesign the system and replace existing applications atour leisure,&quot; he says.andP;  Without the license fees of the old system, the newsolution can be cost-effective as well, he added.andM;For many users, the big question is not just how to get to a relationalsystem, but how to get to a specific relational system: IBM's DB2.andP;  To helpthem, IBM has recently introduced three conversion guides, for convertingfrom IDMS, Adabas, and Datacom/DB to BD2.andM;USER INTEREST IN DB2andM;IBM has received thousands of requests for the guides, according to RussellDonovan, database market support manager at IBM's application enablingmarketing center in San Jose, Calif.andM;User acceptance of relational database technology and SQL, as well asimproved relational productivity, are sparking this newfound interest in DB2,Donovan says.andP;  &quot;People aren't going to buy non-relational systems they knowthey'll have trouble maintaining and will have to rewrite into relational injust a few years.andP;  They want to protect their investments by investing inrelational systems and SQL now.&quot;andM;SAA, too, has been a &quot;real boost&quot; for relational technology, Donovan says.andO;&quot;SAA is based on a relational database.andP;  Customers want to be able to moveapplications across hardware platforms and access data transparently.andP;  Theacceptance of SAA has accelerated the acceptance of SQL and relationaltechnology.&quot;andM;Despite his conviction that users no longer want to invest in nonrelationaltechnology, Donovan does not recommend wholesale conversion efforts.andP;  &quot;Whenmajor changes have to be made, that's a good time to think about moving over.andO;But if there's no reason to change, don't convert,&quot; he advises.andM;Donovan recommended the following steps for converting to DB2: First,optimize the existing database for a relational system, to gain fullperformance advantages.andM;Second, minimize code changes.andP;  &quot;Call-to-call conversions won't performwell,&quot; Donovan says.andP;  For instance, five or six IDMS calls can be replaced byone call to DB2.andM;Then, automate testing--one of the most time-consuming aspects of anydatabase conversion; and finally, hold end-user requests for changes untilafter the conversion is completed.andM;IBM recommends several tools to aid in the DB2 conversion effort.andP;  &quot;Bachman'stools do a nice job of analyzing the existing data dictionary and coming upwith an optimized design,&quot; Donovan said.andM;Another product, DBLink/IDMS from San Francisco-based Forecross, actuallyruns through application code and converts it to DB2, Donovan says.andP;  Theproduct creates DB2 tables from IDMS records, migrates the data over toDB2--generating a series of Cobol programs for each record that isconverted--and finally converts the source code to DB2 calls.andM;In addition to the Cross System Product (CSP) fourth-generation language andQuery Management Facility, IBM offers several other tools to aid inconversions to DB2.andM;DBMaui is a migration aid that allows users to move tables from one system toanother.andP;  DXT accesses data from IMS, Vsam or other relational systems andmoves it to DB2.andP;  Additional tools are DBEdit, a screen editor; DB2PM, aperformance monitor; and DBRad, a dictionary product.andM;As for IMS conversions to DB2, IBM is promoting co-existence as the bestsolution--for now.andP;  IBM is looking at putting SQL interfaces to IMS, Donovansays.andP;  But eventually, a conversion guide for IMS will come, because IMS isnot--and never will be--part of SAA.andM;Consultants are also available to help in DB2 conversions.andM;Carl Fitch, corporate director of database consulting at New York-based CapGemini America, said sources at the IBM Application Enabling Marketing Centerin Cary, N.CC., told him that of all companies that installed DB2 last year,42% used a consultant or vendor to help them get started.andM;GOOD DESIGN IS IMPORTANTandM;Cap gemini has developed a series of Prolog-based expert systems programsthat it uses as part of its services to aid the conversion effort.andP;  Theexpert system &quot;pulls apart&quot; calls in the source database, analyzes them, andbreaks down the Cobol syntax.andM;Conv erting from other relational systems to DB2 is a straightforwardprocess, says Fitch, if--and it's a big if--both databases use Ansi standardSQL calls.andP;  But converting hierarchical or network databases, such as IMS orIDMS, to DB2 is &quot;at the other end of the spectrum,&quot; Fitch says.andM;&quot;In a hierarchical system, you have to write all your programs around thedatabase's structure.andP;  You have to write navigational code that tells thesystem how to go get what you want.andM;&quot;That means squat to a relational system.andP;  You just tell it what you want,not how to go get it, and you get a set of data back, rather than record byrecord,&quot; Fitch says.andM;The job of Cap Gemini's expert system tool is to follow the old database'sprogramming logic, analyze what the process is doing, and determine whichcalls are really necessary in designing the new database.andM;&quot;The most important piece of a DB2 conversion is doing a good job ofdesigning the DB2 tables,&quot; Fitch says.andP;  &quot;After you do your logical datamodeling and normalize the data, then you can do physical database design andlook at your processes.andP;  The idea is to set up a quality platform for DB2 andfigure out the best way to get there from where you are now, whether thatmeans re-engineering, rewriting or converting source code.&quot;andM;Niemann of Computer Task Group, another DB2 conversion consultant, sees theshift to DB2 and other relational systems as preparation for the future ofinformation systems.andP;  &quot;Migration to DB2 is going to be more common,&quot; he says.andM;&quot;As SAA matures, we'll see another revolution in terms of processdistribution between workstations and the mainframe, and distributeddatabases working together,&quot; Niemann continued.andM;&quot;Lots of companies are rethinki ng the way they do applications, and suchissues as managing networks of workstations and distributing software.andP;  Thechanges will be even more radical than database conversion.andP;  It's a fun areato watch,&quot; he said.andM;Francett is a freelance writer based in Bloomfield, N.J.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
