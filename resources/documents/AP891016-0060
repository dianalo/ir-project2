The justices agreed last February to decide the issue in anappeal by a New York lawyer who acted as executor and attorney fora $450,000 estate.   In a brief announcement today, the court said without furtherexplanation that the appeal had been ``improvidently granted.''   The court voted, 8-1, to dismiss the case. Justice Byron R.White dissented.   The justices' action has the effect of permitting an IRSsubpoena of the files of James M. White, a Rochester attorney whohandled the will of Helen P. Smith after she died in November 1982.   A state judge who presided over enforcement of the will, aprocedure known as probate, ruled in 1984 that White should be paid$16,800 for his legal services and $17,548 as an executor'scommission.   White deducted those amounts when calculating the federal taxowed by the estate.   The IRS said White must provide records to justify thedeductions. The lawyer refused to comply, contending the amount oftime he spent handling the settling of the will and the hourlyrates he charged did not bear on whether the fees were reasonableunder New York law.   A federal judge ruled that the IRS failed to show itsinvestigation of the case is reasonable. The judge said the IRS didnot demonstrate any reason to suspect ``fraud, overreaching orexcessiveness'' by White to justify inspecting his records.   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the federaljudge's decision and said White must provide the documents eventhough there is no claim he acted improperly.   The IRS has the authority to require the information in itsinvestigation of the tax liability of the Smith estate, the appealscourt said.   In appealing to the Supreme Court, White said, ``No federalinterest is served by permitting the Internal Revenue Service orthe federal court to redetermine the reasonableness of anattorney's fee that has already been considered and approved by astate probate court.''   The case is White vs. U.S., 88-928.</TEXT></DOC>
