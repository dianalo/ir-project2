If the fines proposed Tuesday are approved, they would be thehighest ever imposed by the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration against a telecommunications company.   The accusations stem from 26 unannounced visits to New YorkTelephone work sites throughout the state in July, when theCommunications Workers union lodged complaints with OSHA.   OSHA found 62 willful violations, 16 serious violations and two``other-than-serious'' violations.   ``It's a very widespread case,'' said Edward Jerome, an officialat OSHA's Albany regional office. ``It's unusual in that extent,that we had so many facilities not in compliance.''   Anthony DeSiervi, OSHA assistant regional administrator in NewYork City, noted that most of the citations involved paperwork.``We are not alleging employees were overexposed to thesematerials,'' he said.   New York Telephone spokesman Tony Pappas denied the allegations.   ``This company has always been interested in safety,'' he said.``A willful violation is not something the company would do. We aregoing to contest that.''   The company has until Dec. 12 to contest the citations.   The agency claimed that the company willfully violated OSHAstandards by failing to inform employees about hazardous materialsand train workers in handling such substances.   Other alleged violations involved failure to properly storecompressed gas cylinders and test employees for exposure to lead.   The mentioned substances, which included compressed gases,leaded solder and solvents, can cause reproductive system problems,nerve disorders, dizziness, skin and eye irritation, breathingproblems, headaches and nausea.   Marsha Love, a health and safety director for the CWA, said thecompany had eight years to implement safety measures under statelaw, which was superseded by federal law in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
