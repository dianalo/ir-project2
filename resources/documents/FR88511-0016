The Commission's Complaint against Occidental is stillpending and is currently in adjudication in an administrative proceeding.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ PVC resin is a ``thermoplastic'' material, i.e., a typeof plastic that becomes soft and malleable when heated.The proposed consent order with Tenneco has been placed on the public recordfor sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Commentsreceived during this period will become part of the public record. Aftersixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and thecomments received, and will decide whether it should withdraw from theagreement or make final the agreement's proposed order.The Complaint, which was issued on April 11, 1986, challenges the acquisitionand the acquisition agreement between Occidental and Tenneco as violationsof section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, and section5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45. The Complaintalleges that, at the time of the acquisition, Occidental and Tenneco weresubstantial, direct competitors in three concentrated, United States markets:mass and suspension PVC resin, suspension PVC copolymer resin, and dispersionPVC resin. The Complaint also alleges that entry into each of the relevantmarkets is difficult. The Complaint further alleges that the acquisitionand acquisition agreement have the effect of eliminating actual competitionbetween Occidental and Tenneco in each of the relevant markets; eliminatingTenneco as a significant competitor in each of the relevant markets; significantlyincreasing the levels of concentration in each of the relevant markets;significantly enhancing the likelihood of collusion or interdependent coordinationamong the remaining firms in each of the relevant markets; and significantlyenhancing the likelihood of dominant firm behavior to increase price inthe suspension PVC copolymer resin market.The proposed consent order with Tenneco, accepted subject to final approval,preserves the Commission's remedial options with respect to the ongoingadministrative proceeding. The proposed consent order provides that, inthe event a divestiture order is entered by the Commission against Occidentalin this proceeding, Tenneco shall consent to the assignment by Occidental,to the acquirer(s) of any PVC assets or business divested by Occidentalpursuant to that order, in a manner that has received the prior approvalof the Federal Trade Commission, of all benefits, rights, and privilegesextended to Occidental under the terms of the sale agreement, with certainexclusions; that Tenneco will cooperate in the transfer of any PVC assetsor business divested by Occidental to a third party pursuant to Commissionorder, and will take no action that interferes with any Commission-orderedrelief; that the final order of the Commission against Occidental may prohibitOccidental from exercising an option granted under the acquisition agreementto compel Tenneco to repurchase Tenneco's former Burlington, New Jersey,PVC facility, or may require that any reacquisition by Tenneco of the Burlington,New Jersey, PVC facility be made only in a manner that has received theCommission's prior approval; and that any reacquisition by Tenneco of theBurlington, New Jersey, PVC plant shall only be made in a manner that isconsistent with the purposes of the Commission's final order against Occidental.The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposedconsent order. It is not intended to constitute an official interpretationof the Complaint or the agreement containing the proposed consent order,or to modify their terms in any way.<ITAG tagnum="6">Emily H.
