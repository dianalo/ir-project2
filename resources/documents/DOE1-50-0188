These result from the growth of hadron-nucleon cross sectionsand an expected increase of the average transverse momenta of secondaries.The model of quark-gluon strings is used to calculate the inclusive spectraof secondaries. Interactions with a fixed number of nucleons are calculated,taking account of the growth of the slope parameter in elastic hN scattering.Violation of Feynman scaling at superhigh energies turns out to be strongerthan the additive quark model predicts it to be.</TEXT></DOC>
