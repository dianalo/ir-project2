Six people were killedand 26 wounded, police said.   The whooshing sound of outgoing rockets and the thuds ofexploding shells rocked the city. Smoke and dust billowed fromseveral targeted areas.   By police count, 380 people have been killed and 1,497 woundedsince March 8, when the current round of violence broke out pittingChristian Army Cmdr. Gen. Michel Aoun's troops against Syrian andallied militia forces.   A police spokesman said today's fatalities included two civilianskilled in Moslem west Beirut when a shell crashed on their car. Thetwo were driving on a seaside boulevard where the Syrians haveseveral artillery batteries firing on Christian districts.   A civilian also was killed at west Beirut's Barbir hospital, nearthe capital's dividing Green Line, when the facility took severaldirect rounds from Christian gunners, said the spokesman who couldnot be named in line with standing regulations.   He said the three other civilians were killed in Christian eastBeirut.   A hospital official, speaking on condition he not be named, saidthe man killed at the hospital had taken refuge there after shellingstarted while he was in the street.   Syrian artillery batteries also shelled the Christian coastlinenorth of the city to maintain a blockade of the enclave, home toabout 1 million Christians.   Christian radio stations interrupted their programs to flashreports of the renewed Syrian shelling and urge the population totake the needed precautions.   ``This is the way the Syrians responded to the cease-fire calledby the tripartite Arab committee,'' the Voice of Lebanon radio said.   The truce was requested Tuesday by King Hassan II of Morocco,King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria.   The three leaders, concluding talks in Oran, Algeria, also calledfor lifting the siege of the Christian enclave. It invited Lebanon'sParliament to meet outside the country to forge a settlement to the14-year-old civil war.   An Arab League leaders' summit in Morocco last month asked thethree heads of state to find a settlement to the civil war byNovember.   Christian and Moslem leaders have welcomed the call by the threeArab leaders for an end to ``violence in all its forms,'' butdiffered on whether Lebanon's Parliament should meet overseas.   Christian parliament members in general have opposed meetingoutside Lebanon, saying if the siege were lifted and crossinggateways re-opened there would be no need to travel.   Shafiq Badr was the only Christian deputy who expressed readinessWednesday to ``go anywhere to discuss an end to the war.''   The independent daily paper An-Nahar said Aoun, a Maronite,expressed reservations over parliament's meeting abroad because it``contradicts Lebanon's sovereignty.''   ``However, it is up to the deputies to decide,'' the paper quotedthe 54-year-old general as saying.   Syria's 40,000 troops in Lebanon besieged the Christian enclaveearly in March to retaliate for a blockade imposed by Aoun againstillegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of Beirut.   Aoun and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of failing toachieve a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 22-nation Arab Leagueby siding with the Moslems against the Christians in the Lebanesecivil war.   Pro-Syrian Moslem and leftist factions say Syrian troops shouldremain in Lebanon until the Christians agree to reform the 45-yearpolitical system in a way that guarantees equal shares to thevarious sects in running the nation's affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
