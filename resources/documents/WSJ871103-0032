The mediator has imposed a news blackout on the two sides, so a Big Board spokesman couldn't comment on the talks. The spokesman did say that the exchange would be able to function normally in the event of a walkout.    The workers, members of the Office and Professional Employees International Union Local 153, work for the exchange; for Securities Industry Automation Corp., which operates the exchange's computers and of which the Big Board owns two-thirds; and for the New York Futures Exchange, a unit of the Big Board.    Officials at the union and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service couldn't be reached for comment.    When the union's previous contract expired in October 1984, the union kept working for eight months without a contract until an agreement was reached in June 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
