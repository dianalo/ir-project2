For UV and pulsed double-frequencyNd:YAG lasers ablation rates were constant in time and depended linearlyon average laser power, but for cw and chopped argon lasers ablationrates varied with irradiation time and were nonlinearly dependent onlaser power. In human aortas, atherosclerosis without gross calcificationhad no influence on ablation rates. Charring and tissue disruption wereobserved with cw and chopped argon ion, whereas excimer and pulsed Nd:YAGlasers produced only minimal injury to surrounding tissue. We concludethat the determination of ablation rates is useful for the selectionof laser wavelengths and power densities applicable to angioplasty andthat UV and pulsed visible laser permit a better control of ablationcompared to continuous wave lasers.</TEXT></DOC>
