President-elect Bush, acting in his role as vice president,gaveled the Senate into session and then immediately administeredthe oath of office to the new and re-elected senators in groups offour.   The Senate chamber was outfitted with new gold curtains behindthe presiding officer's chair and new carpet throughout. There werenew benches upholstered in bright scarlet for staff members. ``It'sall for television,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., showing off theaccommodations to constituents.   The galleries were packed with spectators, including Lady ByrdJohnson, widow of the late president and mother-in-law of Virginia'snew Democratic Sen. Chuck Robb.   In the House, the chamber was packed by members, their familiesand friends as Texas Democrat Jim Wright was re-elected speaker in aparty-line vote of 253-170 with two members voting ``present,'' overRepublican leader Bob Michel of Illinois.   The speaker entered the chamber to a standing ovation beforeleading the mass swearing-in ceremony.   Democrats hold strong majorities in both chambers, 55-45 in theSenate and 259-174 in the House. Today, there was talk ofcooperation with Bush from leaders of both parties.   ``By working together, we can help our new president fulfill hispromise of `a kinder, gentler America','' Wright said in hisstatement accepting re-election.   ``We're very optimistic that we're going to be able to work withPresident-elect) Bush and we can solve some of the problems,'' saidRep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., House majority whip. ``We need to havethat cooperation. ... We'd like to resolve some problems and get ridof some of this confrontation.''   ``I think at least at the outset ... the appropriate tone is oneof cooperation and a spirit of bipartisanship, and let's see how farwe can go with that,'' said Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., House minoritywhip.   Moving to get a jump on other lawmakers, Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa,announced a bill to force roll-call votes before Congress acceptsany pay increase, and delay any approved raise two years _ untilafter the next election. Under current law, Congress automaticallygets a boost proposed by the president unless it votes it down.   ``Congressional pay adjustments have become a perpetual source ofdebate, controversy and embarrassment,'' Tauke said.   President Reagan is expected to call for a substantial pay raisenext week for members of Congress to take effect March 1 unlessrejected before then by both houses. An advisory commission hasrecommended a 50 percent boost for lawmakers, federal judges, andtop executive branch officials, with members of Congress giving uplucrative honorariums in exchange.   Current congressional pay is $89,500 a year, and the commission'sproposal would raise it to $135,000.   ``If the president goes ahead and proposes a pay raise we'reprepared to go ahead and eliminate the honorariums,'' Coelho said.   While the Democratic-controlled Congress awaits Reagan's proposalon the pay issue, on most of the nation's biggest issues it'swaiting for the new president-elect to make his positions known.   Lawmakers from both parties reaffirmed today their hope thatrelations with the Bush White House will be good.   But Cheney and Coelho, interviewed on ``CBS This Morning'', haddiffering views on possible tax increases.   ``None of us would like to increase taxes but we're willing tolisten and watch and we hope that as we get into this, and we haveto get to the crunch, that if he (Bush) can't reach the magic numberwithout raising revenue, that he would say so and we would go aheadand do it,'' Coelho said.   ``I think the American people voted overwhelmingly in oppositionto a tax increase and I don't believe that he should be giving awayor making a concession on that point before we even sit down at thetable to negotiate,'' said Cheney.   New and re-elected members of the House and Senate were beingsworn in today, and then the two chambers scheduled organizationalchores for two days. Among them: a joint session on Wednesday tocount the electoral votes for president.   After completing its organizational chores, Congress will adjournuntil Jan. 20, although hearings could start before then on some ofBush's legislative proposals.   President Reagan sends his final budget to Congress Jan. 9, andBush is expected to submit his own ideas after taking office. Beforefiscal 1990 begins Oct. 1, Congress and the new president must agreeon how to cut more than $25 billion in spending, or to raise taxes,in order to meet the goals of the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law.   Awaiting Bush's proposals before offering their own are HouseSpeaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and the Senate's new majority leader,George Mitchell of Maine. Mitchell succeeds Sen. Robert C. Byrd,D-W.Va., who will also play a key fiscal role as he moves over tothe chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee.   Bush pledged repeatedly during the campaign he would not supportany new taxes, but many Democrats are openly skeptical he can keepthat promise.   Among the doubters are the chairmen of the House and SenateBudget committees _ both new to those posts _ Rep. Leon Panetta,D-Calif., and Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn. Sasser has publicly predictedthat Bush would be coming to Congress within two years asking for atax increase.   Bob Michel, R-Ill., who returns as the House minority leader,said he suspects some new taxes might have to be combined withspending cuts for the deficit goals to be achieved.   ``I suspect down the road a piece that may be part of theanswer,'' Michel said in a television interview last weekend.   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, re-elected Senate Republican leader,said he hasn't seen any indications that Bush is softening hisanti-tax position. But he warned demands on the federal till areincreasing, including tens of billions of dollars needed to bail outfailing savings institutions and to reopen the nation's nuclearweapons plants, which have been plagued by safety problems.</TEXT></DOC>
