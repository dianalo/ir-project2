No thyroid imaging test should be routinely obtained.Radionuclide scanning is most beneficial in evaluating the functionalstatus of thyroid nodules when fine-needle aspiration is inadequate,the findings are benign, or when there is no discrete nodule that ispalpated in an enlarged gland. When fine-needle aspiration is unavailableor unreliable, radionuclide scanning becomes a first-line diagnostictool. Ultrasonography should be used primarily for identifying a solidcomponent of a cystic nodule, determining the size of nodules on thyroxinesuppression that are not easily palpable, or for performing guided fine-needleaspiration. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging bothhave a definite role in the evaluation of thyroid tumors. Magnetic resonanceimaging is superior to computerized tomography for the evaluation ofmetastatic, retrotracheal, or mediastinal involvement of large thyroidtumors or goiters. Careful selection of the diagnostic techniques willensure more accurate diagnosis and reduce unnecessary patient costs inthe treatment of thyroid cancer.</TEXT></DOC>
