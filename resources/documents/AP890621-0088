President Bush repeatedly had made it clear that he would notsign legislation increasing the minimum wage beyond $4.25 per hour.He also insisted that the increase be accompanied by a subminimumtraining wage that employers could pay to all newly employed workersfor as long as six months.   The president maintained that to go any higher on the minimumwage would cause an unacceptable loss of jobs and add toinflationary pressure.   Unless Congress and Bush can come to some agreement, the endresult will be that there will be no increase of any kind in theminimum wage this year. ``The working poor will be denied anyincrease at all because some people want to score a politicalpoint,'' noted Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas.   No doubt his political opponents will portray the president asbeing insensitive to the needs of the working poor because of theveto. We don't think the American people will buy such propaganda,however.   The president had no choice but to disapprove the minimum wagebill. He had made his position clear and had to stick with it.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 14   The Times Record, Brunswick, Maine, on Bush's clean air plan:   As long as President Reagan sided with industrial polluters,congressional debate centered upon whether clean air laws should beenacted.   But with George Bush supporting clean air legislation,congressional debate will now center on finding the middle groundbetween the administration's program and other, even more stringentlegislative proposals.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 19   The Sentinel, Keene, N.H., on abuse of the franking privilege:   Members of Congress have used $1 billion worth of free mailingprivileges in the past 18 years.   There's nothing improper about members of Congres using the frankto communicate.   But last year members of Congress sent out an average of fivepieces of mail for each one received. Clearly, Americans are hearingfrom these people a good deal more than is necessary or requested.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 18   The Providence (R.I.) Sunday Journal on the U.S. miliary spaceprogram:   With little fanfare, another competitor in the space payloadbusiness entered _ or rather, re-entered _ the list against NASAthis past week. ...   It was the Department of Defense, and its new Titan 4 rocketprovides the military with a payload capacity even larger than thatof the famous shuttle.   The morning liftoff of this 204-foot workhorse was an encouragingsuccess. It not only lifted a substantial payload (thought to be anew early warning satellite) off Cape Canaveral, but removed a hugeworry from the Pentagon's shoulders.   The explosion of the Challenger three years ago threw themilitary space program into disarray; this Titan launch representsthe Pentagon's desire to reduce its dependency on a single type ofcraft.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 15   Spartanburg (S.C.) Herald-Journal on firearms and children:   The lesson is abundantly obvious: Any adult who keeps a firearmof any kind handy in a home where there are children, even ifthey're just frequent visitors, should be sure to keep the weaponsafely away from the reach of little ones.   Everybody in the family should be carefully taught about handlingpistols or rifles and about proper use of them.   Young people see so much gunplay on television nowadays that itbecomes rather routine and mundane in their minds. When weapons arearound, children should be taught about the dangers guns pose incareless or untrained hands. Adults also stand constant remindingthemselves.   A state legislator from Sarasota (Fla.) re-introduced a bill thatwas killed in 1988 and died in committee this year to make the ownerof a gun liable when the weapon is left within the reach of a childwho shoots someone. ...   Any rational person can imagine the horror facing parents whosechildren become cold statistics because of a combination ofyouthfulness, guns and adult irresponsibility. Owners of weaponsthat kill should bear some of the burden.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
