It alsoclarified situations causing diversions, defined other assets acquiredby license fees, and identified sources of license revenues affected bythe proposed rule. This action would require States to use interest earnedon hunting and fishing license revenues for fish and wildlife resourcemanagement as a condition to remain eligible to receive Federal Aid (Pittman-Robertsonor Dingell-Johnson) funds. Twenty-four States and the District of Columbia provided comments on theproposal; nine supported the rule as proposed, one opposed it, and 15 suggestedmodifications. Seven comments were received from private parties; threesupported the rule as proposed, one opposed it, and three suggested modifications.Because of the high number of comments suggesting modification, the rulewas not adopted. This amended proposed rule is being proposed to accommodatethe concerns expressed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be received by September 19, 1988. A three-yearphase-in period for those States that will require legislative action toimplement these requirements is intended when and if this proposal is adopted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Any comments on the proposed requirements should bemailed to the Assistant Director_Fish and Wildlife Enhancement, U.S. Fishand Wildlife Service, Room 3024, Interior Building, Washington, DC 20240.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Conley Moffett, Chief, Divisionof Federal Aid, U.S. fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC 20240, telephone(703) 235-1526.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Both the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration(16 U.S.C. 669, <T3>et seq.</T3>) and Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration (16 U.S.C.777 <T3>et seq.</T3>) Acts contain provisions requiring that no money may beappropriated to a State until that State has passed laws assenting to theprovisions of the Act and has passed laws for the conservation of wildlifeand fish. Such laws must contain a prohibition against diversion of licensefees paid by hunters and fishermen for any other purpose than the administrationof the State fish and wildlife agency. The proposed rule will clarify previouslyundefined Department of the Interior rules in accord with the generally-acceptedprinciple that interest should accrue to principal from which it was generated.Thirty-eight percent of the comments received as a result of the previousproposed rule pointed out that many States would be required to enact Statelaws to adopt the rules and that it could take several years. It was requestedthat a phase-in period be allowed so that States would not lose money duringthe period it took to make the required changes. To accommodate those concerns,this proposal allows a three-year period for those States that are notin compliance to conform their laws. Twenty-three percent of the comments asked that commercial fishing licensesnot be included and stated a variety of reasons why they should not. Becauseof those comments, this proposal does not include commercial licenses forthe taking of fish or wildlife. Thirteen percent of the comments stated the interest earned on licensemoney has been used to pay for administrative services to support the fishand wildlife agency. If this source of funds were taken away, the fishand wildlife agency may still be charged directly for these services. Nochanges to the proposed rule were deemed necessary. The remaining comments related to definitions, speculation on how programswould be affected, and statements of opinion. These comments were consideredand incorporated as appropriate. The existing Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act and Federal Aid inSport Fish Restoration Act require that as a prerequisite to receivingfederal funds, States must prevent diversions of license fees derived fromfishermen and hunters to any purpose other than ``the administration ofsaid State game and fish department.'' The existing rule promulgated underauthority of the Acts (50 CFR 80.4) states that ``[a] diversion of licensefees occurs when a State fish and wildlife agency, through legislationor otherwise: (1) Loses control of the expenditure of any portion of itslicense revenues, or (2) loses control of capital assets (or income therefrom)derived from license revenues * * * *'' Because of the increased complexityof State government and the variety of responsibilities assigned to fishand wildlife agencies, the requirements relating to control of assets andexpenditures involve an increased number of controls at higher levels inthe State. Accordingly, this proposed rule does not require that fish andwildlife agencies have complete contol over license funds, but, instead,that license revenues must be used by State fish and wildlife agenciesonly to manage fish and wildlife resources over which they have managementauthority by the State law. The Department has determined that this proposed rule is not a major Federalaction significantly affecting the quality of the human environment underthe National Environmental Policy Act and, therefore, the preparation ofan Environmental Impact Statement is not required.This proposed rule is not a major rule under Executive Order 12291 andwill not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number ofsmall entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). Theannual effect on the economy will be less than the threshold required fora major rule, no major increase in costs or prices will occur, and no significanteffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovationare expected. This proposed rule does not contain any recordkeeping orinfromation collection requirements requiring Office of Management andBudget approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.The principal author of this proposal is Thomas W. Taylor, Division ofFederal Aid, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subject in 50 CFR Part 80</ITAG>Fish grant programs, Natural resources, Grant administration, and Wildlife.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 80_[AMENDED]</ITAG>Accordingly, it is proposed to amend 50 CFR 80 as follows:1.
