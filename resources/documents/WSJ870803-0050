The institutions are OK Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, El Reno, Okla., which has assets of $54.5 million, and Valley Bank of Belgrade, in Belgrade, Mont., which has assets of $18.6 million.    The Federal Home Loan Bank Board agreed to make a cash contribution to help Phoenix Capital Group Inc., Wichita, Kan., acquire OK Federal, which will be named Globe Savings Bank after the transaction.    Phoenix has agreed to make a $3 million capital contribution to the thrift in exchange for all of its common stock. The Bank Board also agreed to indemnify Phoenix against any possible litigation resulting from the transaction. The cost of the Bank Board's aid is estimated to be $41.2 million.    The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. agreed to facilitate the acquisition of Valley Bank by Mountain Bank Systems Inc., a Whitefish, Mont.-based bank holding company. Valley Bank holds deposits of $16.9 million. The FDIC will provide Valley Bank with a cash infusion of $3 million and Mountain Bank will contribute an additional $1 million.    The FDIC acted after state banking regulators told the agency that Valley Bank was in danger of failing. The FDIC generally limits its assistance to helping the buyer of a failed bank, but it will approve a transaction involving a bank that hasn't closed if officials believe doing so would be less expensive.    The FDIC also announced resolutions in the cases of two banks that closed Thursday. Farmers State Bank, Kanawha, Iowa, which had assets of $15.4 million, reopened Friday as a branch of First National Bank of Clarion, in Clarion, Iowa. Farmers State, which held $14.3 million in 2,900 accounts, was the fifth Iowa bank to fail this year.    The FDIC began paying the insured deposits of Empire National Bank, Los Angeles, which had assets of $9.2 million, because it didn't receive any bids for the failed bank's purchase.    Empire held $7.8 million in 700 deposit accounts, including $60,000 in 17 accounts that exceeded the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor. Owners of uninsured deposits will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds from the sale of the failed bank's assets.    Empire was the fifth California bank to fail this year. A total of 106 banks have been closed this year nationwide. </TEXT></DOC>
