The companies that build cars in the U.S. expect toassemble 1,502,013 cars in the second quarter, according toindustry sources and Ward's Automotive Reports, a tradepublication. That would make it the worst second quartersince 1956.</LP><TEXT>   The gloomy production plans reflect the nation'srecession, but they may help prolong it as well. That'sbecause car production is such an important chunk of thenation's gross national product. &quot;In lowering productionschedules in the quarter ahead, {auto makers} will becontributing to at least one further quarter of prolongedeconomic slump,&quot; said David Littmann, senior economist atManufacturers National Bank of Detroit.   Just the same, many auto analysts praised the autoindustry for keeping its inventory level relatively leanduring a steep sales downturn. The industry had a 72-daysupply of cars at the end of February, not too far above anideal level, said analyst John Qualls of Hill andamp; Knowlton Inc.That means car makers are positioned to benefit quickly ifsales pick up.   And while second-quarter production plans are downbeat,analysts note that they're still an improvement from thecurrent quarter. According to the latest productionschedules, the industry will assemble only 1,311,930 cars inthe first three months of 1991. That's a 10.8% drop from aweak year-ago performance, and 283,000 fewer cars than theindustry planned to build just two months ago.   General Motors Corp. now plans to assemble only 594,900cars, its lowest first-quarter output since at least 1955.Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have slashed theirfirst-quarter production schedules 26.1% and 34.2% from ayear ago, respectively.   And the pain isn't limited to the Big Three. Honda MotorCo. expects its first-quarter car production to drop 2.5%from 1990. Mazda Motor Corp.'s first-quarter production isslated to fall 15.9% from a year ago.   Other Japanese plants continue to increase production,however. The new Subaru-Isuzu joint venture in Indiana isscheduled to produce 14,691 cars in the first quarter, morethan tripling its year-ago production -- albeit on a tinybase. Overall, plants owned or operated by the Japanese arescheduled to build 26.5% of the cars made in the U.S. thisquarter, up from 22.9% in the first quarter of 1990.   Auto makers scheduled even bigger cuts in truck productionin the first quarter. The industry plans to build 640,257pickup trucks, off-road vehicles and vans in the firstquarter, a 27.9% decrease from a year ago. Trucks, becausethey tend to get poorer fuel economy, were hit harder thancars by last fall's rising gasoline prices. However, gasprices have been dropping lately and truck sales fell lessthan car sales in late February.   Beginning last Friday, Isuzu Motors Ltd. said it wascutting its U.S. production by 1,000 vehicles a month forseveral months because of the recession. Subaru of America,which shares a plant in Indiana with Isuzu, is cutting output20 cars a day.   Beginning Monday, the Big Three car makers plan to idletemporarily or extend shutdowns at 17 additional plants inthe U.S. and Canada for at least one week. General Motorsexpects to idle seven plants: Ford expects to closetemporarily five plants; and Chrysler is idling five plants.   Overall, the industry expects to produce 99,567 vehiclesthis week, down from 136,380 vehicles a year ago and 104,785vehicles last week. For all of February, auto makers produced622,388 vehicles, down from 788,129 vehicles a year ago.   ---                 FIRST QUARTER PRODUCTION                                                                                                                                  CARS                                                                                                                                        1991      1990     %Chg.
