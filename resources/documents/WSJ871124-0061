The meeting had been scheduled for today. TCA-IV L.P., a New Haven, Conn. partnership led by Yale University Professor William P. Lyons, recently launched a $14-a-share, or $66 million, tender offer for the 92% of Duro-Test it doesn't already own.    The North Bergen, N.J., light bulb maker said the postponement will allow it &quot;to cure certain alleged&quot; violations of its bylaws and &quot;alleged inadequate disclosure&quot; in its Oct. 23 proxy statement.    Separately, in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, TCA-IV demanded that it be furnished with information on Duro-Test &quot;that is being given or has already been given to third parties&quot; interested in acquiring the company. Previously, Los Angeles-based American Magnetics Corp., which controls 6% of DuroTest, said that it had met with the company to study a possible combination. </TEXT></DOC>
