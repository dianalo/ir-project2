Also, the turmoil in the stock markets has made more uncertain the possibility of Hunt entities raising money in debt or equity markets to help pay off at least some of the more than $1.5 billion owed the banks by the Hunts' big energy companies, Placid Oil Co. and Penrod Drilling Co. &quot;We are further away from a settlement than we were around Labor Day,&quot; said one official involved in the discussions.    Rumors that the secretive Hunt brothers had dumped First Boston Corp. had been circulating ever since the New York investment bankers, who were charging Hunt entities $200,000 a month plus expenses, had literally taken a back seat at private settlement meetings between the Hunts and the banks in recent weeks. Finally, in a federal bankruptcy court here on Friday, Donald E. Dietz III, a First Boston managing director, confirmed that his firm &quot;had received a notice of termination,&quot; effective last week, without explanation by the Hunts, Nelson Bunker, William Herbert and Lamar.    To add insult to First Boston's injury, Judge Harold C. Abramson, presiding in the Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings of Placid Oil and another Hunt entity, scolded First Boston for its free-spending ways. First Boston's expense accounts, which exceeded $100,000 for a five-month span, included first-class air fares for any flight exceeding two hours, rooms at Dallas's finest hotels -- owned by a Hunt sister -- and questionable meal costs.    Judge Abramson refused to approve full payment of the expenses by the Hunt entities. In all likelihood, though, other Hunt entities, which aren't in Chapter 11, will make up the difference to First Boston.    The falling out between the Hunts and their investment bankers apparently came to a climax six weeks ago, after First Boston came up with the previously reported idea of selling major parts of Placid and Penrod to raise cash and settle the dispute. The multibillion-dollar legal battle between the Hunts and 22 U.S. and foreign banks has been running since mid-1986. First Boston asked the lenders to attend a meeting here in early September to hear the plan.    But the Hunts apparently hadn't given First Boston approval to make such a proposal to the banks, and the meeting was canceled. For one thing, it would have stripped the brothers of major parts of the empire bequeathed to them by their late father, H.L. Hunt. In court, Mr. Dietz conceded that the settlement plan &quot;had no final approval or acquiescence by any other parties.&quot; At a later meeting, the Hunts presented an alternative idea and First Boston officials sat quietly in the back of a room crowded with bankers and their attorneys.    At the mid-September meeting, W. Herbert Hunt sketched new settlement alternatives, and presented Richard E. Rainwater, a well-known Texas financier who has been an adviser to the wealthy Bass family of Fort Worth.    Now on his own, Mr. Rainwater and his family have become the largest shareholders of Houston-based Energy Service Co., which is understood to be holding talks with the Hunts about buying Penrod Drilling for a combination of cash and stock. As previously reported, Energy Service has agreed to buy two of Penrod's large offshore drilling rigs and is considering the purchase of three more big rigs by year end.    It is uncertain what effect the topsy-turvy stock market of late would have on Energy Service's acquisition ability, or whether the Hunts and the banks would settle for cash and stock in Energy Service. The Hunts earlier had proposed a public offering of Penrod shares as a means to pay off their debt, but the market for such low-rated securities now is considered weak.    Meanwhile, Placid's banks are expected to submit an outline to the bankruptcy court Thursday calling for the sale of the big independent energy producer for about $1.2 billion. But there isn't any hopeful sign of an immediate buyer. The $1.2 billion figure is based on asset valuation studies done for the Hunts by First Boston, and reflects a higher value for the troubled company since last July. Still, the company owes considerable debts and back taxes. </TEXT></DOC>
