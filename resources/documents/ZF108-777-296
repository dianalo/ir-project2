 They are what DEC terms&quot;midleware,&quot; system software that lies between the operating system andend-user applications.andP;  DEC is the first vendor to actively develop andprmote network-wide publishing services that work across applications.andM;All of the new products are part of Digital's Network Application Support(NAS), in which applications are joined at the network level through commonprogramming interfaces.andP;  Digital is providing a range of network servicesthat third-party developers--and, ultimately, end users of a variety ofapplications--may make use of, rather than building such services themselves.andO;The term middleware reflects the position of software designed to fulfull thenetwork services role.andP;  essentially, DEC's middleware is system software, butbecause it lies outside the realm of the traditional operating environment,DEC is distinguishing it from the underlying system software, which is Ultrixor VMS.andM;In addition to being part of NAS, all of these products also reflect thegrowing support for DEC's Compound Document Architecture (CDA), its frameworkfor data and document interchange in a heterogeneous environment.andM;Content-based retrievers.andP;  The announcement included agreements with foursuppliers of network-wide document retrieval packages that work inconjunction with other next processing applications.andM;First, Information Dimension announced NAS, DDIF and SGML support for itsBasis Plus full-text retrieval engine.andP;  The company now offers thesaurus and&quot;soundex&quot; (homonym) look-ups, as well as the traditional Boolean logicsearches.andM;Basis is the leading text retrieval package for Vax computers.andP;  IDI offersBasis with VMs and Ultrix servers; users may choose among DECwindows, PCswith Microsoft Windows and ASCII terminal clients.andM;Second, DEC announced distribution agreements with Excalibur and GEScan(pronounced G-E-scan).andP;  DEC will offer Excalibur's PixTex, a new programbased on Savvy Neural Network Technology that uses pattern recognition tobuild a search and retrieval index from OCR-scanned documents.andP;  Excalibur hasalso developed pattern-recognition software for ASCII files called Savvy/TRS.andM;Digital will also distribute GEScan's product (which has the creative name&quot;the GEScan system&quot;).andP;  GEScan just released Version 4.0 of its real-timefull-text retrieval engine.andP;  The engine, based on a GE-developed piece ofhardware called the Text Array Processor, searches a database for matches towords, numbers or phrases without building an index.andP;  The TAP is actually acollection of a dozen query processors that collectively process up to 240million character comparisons per second--a speed sufficient to search evenlarge databases in a reasonable amount of time.andM;The database may include images and graphics associated with text, and it maybe configured with other applications, such as Interleaf, Lexis/Nexis orHyperCard.andP;  Often, the engine is installed in conjunction with user profilesand wire services or other online services so that users are automaticallynotified when incoming stories relate to the topics they've set up in theirprofits.andM;Lastly, DEC announced that it has entered into a development agreement withVerity.andP;  Out understanding is that Digital intends to offer a Verity-basedretrieval engine as part of its DECwindows system software.andP;  The engine wouldbe accessible from any application through one programming interface, so thatall applications would initiate searching and retrieval in a similar fashion,and third-party vendors would not have tow write the retrieval themselves.andM;If successful, the agreement with Verity will eventually lead to a variety ofDigital and third-party products that provide Topic-like retrievalcapabilities across a network.andP;  Users would finally have an alternative tosearching on file names!andM;Four-pronged attack.andP;  Content retrievers are just the latest type of networkservice in DEC's overall network product strategy.andP;  It had previouslyannounced printing and SQL services.andP;  The other three new prongs of DEC'smiddleware belt are workflow managers, knowledge linking and structureddocument libraries.andM;The Odesta Document Management System is the first workflow manager forDigital; the two companies announced a cooperative marketing agreement inMarch (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  13, p. 53).andP;  Knowledge Linking refers to the use ofhypertext links in electronic documents.andP;  It is not yet represented in aDigital product, but DEC promised to deliver NAS-based services, such asthose previewed at Seybold Seminars (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  17, pp.andP;  30-31).andO;Structured document libraries, such as those maintained with a product likeDEC's Engineering Document Control System (EDCS) II, might be used with anyof the above technologies.andM;Update to DECwrite.andP;  Seperately, Digital released the first upgrade toDECwrite, its compound document processor for Ultrix and VMS work-stations.andO;Although it is primarily a maintenance release, DECwrite 1.1 does add somenew features.andM;The added functions include the ability to add gray-scale images todocuments; a horizontal scroll bar; support for additional fonts; WordPerfectand Microsoft Word keyboard emulations; and the ability to export documentsin Digital's Bookreader format for archiving, distributing and viewingdocuments electronically.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
