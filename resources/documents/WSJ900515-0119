The industrial average rose 19.95 to close at 2821.53 inheavy trading, eclipsing the Jan. 2 high of 2810.15. But thegain represented a sharp decline from the intraday advance of50.44 at about 1 p.m. EDT.</LP><TEXT>   Bond prices posted solid gains, pushing long-term interestrates lower, but their advance also weakened in late trading.The dollar continued to lose ground against most currencies,albeit at a slower pace than in Friday's sharp retreat.   The stock market's performance Friday and Monday raisedquestions about the extent to which prices can keep rising.&quot;When it happens so suddenly, I've got to be suspicious aboutit,&quot; said Laszlo Birinyi, a stock market strategist.&quot;Suddenly Friday everybody saw the light. It was a suddenright turn and I don't think those are the situations thatlead to continued long, long gains.&quot;   Mr. Birinyi and others were also concerned that thebiggest price gains yesterday continued to come in a smallgroup of big, well-known stocks. The broader market, whichhas lagged the industrial average badly in recent months,remains far short of old records. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stockindex, for instance, closed at 354.75, nearly 1.5% below itsOct. 9, 1989, record high of 359.80.   The rally was triggered Friday by plunging interest ratesas bond investors bid up prices of Treasury issues. The bondmarket was responding not only to evidence that inflation iswaning and economic growth is moderate, but also to thepositive mood created by the apparent willingness of the Bushadministration and Congress to work together to trim thenation's huge budget deficit.   The perception that interest rates had peaked a weekearlier when the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond yielded morethan 9% inspired money managers to shift money into the stockmarket from their bulging hoards of cash. The euphoric buyingdrove the industrial average up 63.07 points Friday.   Yesterday morning saw money managers continuing theirbuying spree, with big blue-chip technology, energy andchemical stocks their primary targets. Their buying waspunctuated by several waves of stock-index arbitrage buyprograms that pushed the industrial average up more than 50points at 1 p.m. EDT.   But the buying enthusiasm was tempered when news servicescarried comments from White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwaterthat he expects deficit-cutting negotiations betweenPresident Bush and Congress to &quot;last weeks, if not months.&quot;   &quot;As soon as that headline came up on the newswires, themarket went from about plus 51 to plus 30,&quot; said ArthurCashin Jr., director of floor operations for PaineWebber Inc.&quot;The bulk of the rationale for the rally has been a change ininterest rates,&quot; Mr. Cashin said, but the budget news setback expectations that interest rates could continue to slidemuch lower. Mr. Birinyi, the stock market strategist, said hestill expects the stock market to do better than it has inthe past few months, with the Dow Jones industrialsapproaching the 3000 mark in coming weeks. &quot;But I'd besurprised if we go above that level and then you're going togo back to more of the same thing we've had all year --dramatic trading and a lot of volatility within a pricerange.&quot;   Skeptical money managers suggested that the rapid priceaction is more a symptom of the volatility in the market thanof any underlying change in the economy or the outlook forsuch fundamental measures of stock values as corporateprofits.   &quot;I continue to be amazed at the rapidity with whichemotions change over the course of a few hours or a fewdays,&quot; said Ellen Harris, manager of the PaineWebber ClassicGrowth Fund. &quot;Concerns that were expressed 11 days ago havenow been forgotten. Economists who would have thrown in thetowel are now focusing on the numbers that are going theirway.&quot;   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices climbed sharply in heavy trading. Volumetotaled 225.4 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange,where advancing issues swamped losers 1,062 to 555.   Bond prices rose. The Treasury's new benchmark 30-yearbond gained 5/8 point, or about $6.25 for each $1,000 of faceamount. The yield on the issue slipped to 8.58%.   The dollar fell modestly. In late New York trading theU.S. currency was quoted at 1.6425 marks and 152.47 yen,compared with 1.6478 marks and 152.65 yen Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
