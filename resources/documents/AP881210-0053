Eight other guerrillas and an Israeli officer were killed Fridayin nine hours of air, sea and ground combat in hills overlooking thecoastal town of Naameh, nine miles south of Beirut.   Three Israeli soldiers were injured and 16 guerrillas werewounded, including one who police said died during the night in ahospital.   Lebanon requested an urgent meeting of the U.N. Security Councilto debate the attack, which drew sharp condemnation from the UnitedStates and Britain.   The Israeli raid coincided with the first anniversary of thePalestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and GazaStrip, in which at least 320 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have beenkilled.   The target of the raid was a major base of the Popular Front forthe Liberation of Palestine-General Command in the Naameh bluffs, 50miles north of the Israeli border.   It was the first time the Israeli army had come so close to theLebanese capital, Beirut, since it evacuated the Chouf mountainssoutheast of the city in 1983, ending a yearlong occupation.   Israeli paratroopers were dropped from helicopters in to a ravinebelow an abandoned Maronite Catholic monastery and attacked theliving quarters and training center of the guerrillas, Lebanesepolice said.   The Israelis used dogs strapped with tear-gas canisters andexplosives to flush out guerrillas from an underground network oftunnels, Popular Front commander Ahmed Jibril told reporters.   One of his aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidPalestinian fighters shot and killed five dogs.   Several previous Israeli air attacks this year have failed toeliminate the Popular Front's Naameh base.   The radical Popular Front, which opposes Palestine LiberationOrganization chairman Yasser Arafat, is armed by Syria andbankrolled by Libya.   During the fighting Friday, four Israelis were cut off from themain landing force, prompting the Israeli command to mount a massiverescue operation.   Waves of Israeli fighter-bombers thundered in on rocketing andstrafing runs and naval gunboats shelled Naameh's highlands untilthe four Israelis were ferried out of Lebanon at mid-morning,clinging to the struts of two helicopter gunships, an Israeli armyofficer said.   The Israeli raid was the second biggest in terms of casualitiesthis year. At least 40 Palestinian and pro-Iranian Shiite Moslemguerrillas were killed when the Israeli army mounted a three-daysweep in southeast Lebanon in May.   In both attacks, Syrian troops stationed close to guerrilla basesdid not intervene in the confrontations.   The Syrians maintain about 40,000 troops in north and eastLebanon as well as Beirut's Moslem sector under a 1976 Arab Leaguemandate to control Lebanon's civil war, now in its 14th year.</TEXT></DOC>
