That proposal hadtwo main components. First, the Board proposed to extend the current equity-riskinvestment rule beyond its sunset date of April 16, 1989. <T3>See</T3> 12 CFR 563.9-8(h) (1988). That portion of the proposal iscovered in a final rule published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register,</T4> which extends the equity-risk investment regulationuntil October 13, 1989.Second, the Board proposed to remove the exclusion from the definitionof ``equity security'' in 12 CFR 563.9-8(b)(2) for stock issued by FannieMae and Freddie Mac, purchased by insured institutions on or after December14, 1988. Furthermore, under the proposal, stock issued by those instrumentalities,as well as by other, similar, United States government-sponsored corporationswould be expressly authorized as investments for purposes of the equity-riskinvestment rule, pursuant to 12 CFR 563.9-8(d)(1). Such express authorizationwould allow an insured institution to invest in those securities withouthaving to acquire the approval of its Principal Supervisory Agent (``PSA''),assuming independent authorization to make such an unapproved purchase.The Board received six comments in response to its proposal. Three of thecomments were from insured institutions, two were from trade associations,and one was from a U.S. government-sponsored corporation.On the issue of whether the Board should remove the exclusion from FannieMae and Freddie Mac stock from the definition of ``equity security,'' twocomment letters supported the proposal as drafted. Each stated that thepublicly traded stock at issue would properly be classified as equity securities.One of those commenters stated that there was no basic distinction betweenthe risk inherent in publicly traded Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock and``the stock of other reputable companies traded on public exchanges.''The remaining four comment letters opposed this aspect of the Board proposal.Each suggested that the Board should continue its exclusion because ofthe housing-oriented mission of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. One commentersuggested that the Board's proposal to make the stock of these entitiesequity-risk investments would run contrary to the Board's ``Qualified ThriftLender'' (``QTL'') test. Two other commenters stated that the inclusionof the stock as equity-risk investments would require insured institutionsto carry a relatively high percentage of capital against their investmentin the stock, pursuant to the Board's recent regulatory capital proposal,\1\<NOTE/> and would, therefore, unwisely discourage institutions frominvesting in the stock.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Board Res. No. 88-1342 (Dec. 15, 1988), 53 FR 51800 (Dec.23, 1988).Two comments addressed the continued exclusion of all purchases of FannieMae and Freddie Mac stock made on or before December 14, 1988, from thedefinition of ``equity security'' and, thus, the scope of the equity-riskinvestment regulation. Both commenters supported the basic plan to includesome sort of savings clause; one commenter supported the Board's December14, 1988, date, and the other commenter suggested that the applicable datebe moved until the effective date of the Board's final regulation. TheBoard received no comments on the portion of the proposal that would expresslyauthorize investment, for equity-risk purposes, in equity securities ofall United States government sponsored corporations.For the reasons set forth below, the Board maintains its support for itsproposal to remove the exclusion from the definition of ``equity security''for investments in Fannie Mae common and Freddie Mac preferred stock. Itbelieves that the publicly traded securities at issue represent similarrisks as that found in investments in equity securities of other U.S. government-sponsoredcorporations, such as the Student Loan Marketing Association (``SallieMae''). As the Board stated in the preamble to its last amendment to theequity-risk investment regulation, ``The Board has a statutory responsibilityto protect the FSLIC insurance fund from undue risk. This is a particularlyheavy burden today because the fund is laboring under the severest pressuresin its history.'' 52 FR 23787, 23788 (June 25, 1987). Those words are evenmore true today, as is the Board's statutory responsibility to promotesafe and sound operations in the thrift industry as a whole.Furthermore, upon reconsideration, the Board is today proposing to treatinvestments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock made on or before December14, 1988, in a manner consistent with the savings clause of the currentequity-risk investment regulation. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 563.9-8(f). Under this treatment, described more fullybelow, all investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock_regardless ofwhen purchased_would be considered equity-risk investments, but the Boardwould ``grandfather''_rather than exclude_those investments in Fannie Maeand Freddie Mac stock made on or before December 14, 1988. The Board isof the view that this grandfathering treatment is necessary because itbelieves that the risks inherent in investment in such stock are equallyconcrete for stock purchased on or before December 14, 1988, as for stockpurchased afterward.In its original proposal, the Board discussed in detail the reasons supportingthe proposed inclusion of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock within the definitionof ``equity security'' and the scope of the equity-risk investment regulation.<T3>See </T3>54 FR at 156-57. The board continues to believe such treatmentis warranted by the risks presented by these stocks, risks equivalent tothose inherent in any equity security.As stated above, several commenters opposed the Board's proposal to removethe exclusion for Fannie Mae and Feddie Mac stock on the ground that the``low-risk'' nature of the underlying residential mortgages in which theentities deal would somehow insulate those entities' stock from marketfluctuations. Market realities provide no support for such assertions.In fact, for the 52 week period ending March 7, 1989, Fannie Mae commonstock has traded in a fairly wide range, trading as high as $65.375 a shareand as low as $31.875 a share. The newly issued Freddie Mac preferred stock,publicly traded since January 2, 1989, has traded as high as $55.875 ashare and as low as $45.50 a share.Another commenter stated that the Board's proposal to make Fannie Mae andFreddie Mac stock equity-risk investments was inconsistent with the Board'sprevious ruling that such investments satisfied an insured institution'sQualified Thrift Lender (``QTL'') requirements. The key component of theQTL test, enacted in the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 (``CEBA''),Pub. L. No. 100-86, 101 Stat. at 571-73, andSection; 104(c)(1) (1987), wasthat insured institutions were required to hold at least 60 percent oftheir tangible assets in certain ``qualified thrift investments'' in orderto qualify for favorable QTL treatment. <T3>See </T3>53 FR 312 (Jan. 6, 1988). Generally, these investments arerelated to domestic real estate or manufactured housing, as well as otherassets that are incidental to the thrift's housing-related investments.<T3>Id. </T3>Stock issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were among theinvestments approved by the Board as QTL investments. <T3>Id. </T3>at 313, 322 (codifid at 12 CFR 563.27(c)(6) (1988)).By stating that an approved QTL investment may not be limited by the equity-riskinvestment regulation, the commenter misconstrues the correlation betweenthe QTL test and the equity-risk rule. Quite simply, the two rules servedifferent purposes and are not mutually exclusive. In devising the QTLtest, Congress' objective was one of ``committing insured institutionsto the unique, congressionally defined role of providing housing-relatedfinance.'' H.R. Rep. No. 261, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 137 (1987). Therewas no mention, however, that the Board should refrain from placing otherregulatory constraints or limitations on any of the investments that qualifyas QTL investments, regardless of the risk involved in that investment.\2\<NOTE/> Merely because an investment is ``housing-related'' doesnot make it risk-free.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ It is important to remember that the equity-risk regulationis only a limitation on investment, without prior PSA approval, not a prohibition.49 FR 48743, 48746 (Dec. 14, 1984).In fact, supervisory and regulatory constraints already exist on an insuredinstitution's investment in several approved QTL assets; these constraintsare either from Board regulation or from supervisory memoranda publishedby the Board's Office of Regulatory Activities (``ORA''). For example,the ability of insured institutions to invest in derivative secondary housingproducts, such as residuals or stripped securities, is currently limitedby ORA Thrift Bullentin TB 12 (issued on Dec. 13, 1988). Furthermore, underthe Board's final QTL rule, certain acquisition, development and constructionloans (``ADC loans''), could qualify both as equity-risk and QTL investments,assuming that the investing institution could properly document the residentialnature of the loan, but financing for the residential housing had not yetbeen obtained. 53 FR at 315;\3\<NOTE/> <T3>see also</T3> ORA Memorandum T-87 (Jan. 13, 1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>Cf</T3>. 52 FR at 23800 (preamble to equity-risk amendment). The Board is reproposing that investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Macstock be pre-authorized investments for equity-risk purposes, pursuantto 12 CFR 563.9-8(d)(1).\4\<NOTE/> The Board notes that such investments are expressly authorizedinvestments for Federal associations pursuant to section 5(c)(1)(F) ofthe Home Owner's Loan Act of 1933 (``HOLA''), 12 U.S.C. 1464(c)(1)(F) (1982),and that investment in such securities appears no more or less risky thanthe other investments currently authorized as equity-risk investments in12 CFR 563.9-8(d). Moreover, the Board is reporposing the express authorization,for equity-risk purposes, of investments in equity securities issued byall United States government-sponsored corporations, including Class Acommon stock recently issued by the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation(``Farmer Mac''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ By expressly listing such investments in subparagraph(d)(1), the Board would be signifying that an insured institution couldinvest in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock up to otherwise authorized thresholds,without having to acquire the approval of the institution's Principal SupervisoryAgent. <ITAG tagnum="84">Issues Pertinent to Reproposal </ITAG>Upon reexamination of the inherent riskiness of Fannie Mae and FreddieMac stock and for the reasons stated above and in the original proposal,the Board now believes that because all current investments in FreddieMac Preferred stock and Fannie Mae common stock_whether originally madebefore or after December 14, 1988_carry equal amounts of risk, all suchinvestments should be counted toward the equity-risk thresholds. Such treatmentappears to be required in order to satisfy the safety and soundness purposesof the equity-risk investment regulation. Nevertheless, the Board recognizesthat a number of thrift institutions may have invested in Fannie Mae andFreddie Mac stock in reliance on the existing provision exempting thatstock from the equity-risk investment thresholds. To that end, today's reproposal provides that an institution whose aggregateequity-risk investments on December 14, 1988, including that institution'sinvestment in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock, exceeds the applicableequity-risk threshold would not be required solely for that reason to divestitself of such Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac stock purchased as of December14, 1988.\5\<NOTE/> The institution could not, however, make additional unsupervisedequity-risk investments until it was in compliance with the applicablethreshold. This treatment would be the same ``grandfathering'' affordedpevious additions to the list of direct or equity-risk investments. <T3>Cf.</T3> 52 FR at 23802; 49 FR at 48754. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Shares of the ``when-issued'' class of Freddie Mac preferredstock held by an institution on December 14, 1988, would be considered``held'' on that date for purposes of this reproposal, even though thoseshares were not issued until January 2, 1989. As stated in the Board's December proposal and in the accompanying finalrule issued today, the Board anticipates publishing an additional noticeof proposed rulemaking to address broader equity-risk investment issueswithin the next few months. <ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>Pursuant to section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603,the Board is providing the following regulatory flexibility analysis. 1. <T3>Reasons, objections and legal basis underlying the proposed rule.</T3>These elements are incorporated above in the <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2> regarding the reproposal. 2. <T3>Small entities to which the proposed rule would apply.</T3> The reproposalwould apply to all insured institutions. 3. <T3>Impact of the proposed rule on small entities.</T3> The Small BusinessAdministration defines a small financial institution as ``a commercialbank or savings and loan association, the assets of which, for the precedingfiscal year, do not exceed $100 million.'' 13 CFR 121.13(a).
