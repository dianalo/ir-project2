Only a handful of such initial approaches by overseas firmsbecame public or amounted to a bid, the survey found.   The study _ a survey of the chief executive officers of 95corporations with annual sales of at least $1 billion _ also foundthat while 60 percent of the respondents felt foreign ownershiptends to maximize shareholder value, just over half said they wouldprefer a U.S. firm as a new owner if they were taken over.   Slightly less than 23 percent of the CEOs reported beingapproached by a prospective domestic buyer last year.   Two-thirds of the chief executives responding to the survey saidthey were more interested in joint ventures and similar linkups withforeign companies than they were in selling.   Northwestern University Professor Edward Zajac, project directorfor the survey, said he was surprised by the number of firms thatreported overtures by foreign companies.   Zajac said the survey showed ``the world is getting smaller'' andU.S. firms are finding that to survive in an increasingly complexworld, they must turn to international alliances.</TEXT></DOC>
