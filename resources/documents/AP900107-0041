The more democratic governments that have taken over from thehard-line communists in Eastern Europe are still liable for thedebts incurred primarily during the 1970s when Western bankersthought the Soviet bloc was a good credit risk.   But there is waning hope among Western financial dealers thatthe loans will ever be paid in full, even as Western governmentsare seeking ways to support the democracy movement so that Westernbankers and businesses will invest in Eastern Europe.   Western bankers fear the new Eastern European governments willset their sights more on internal development programs and less onpaying off old debts.   The old debts of Poland and some other Eastern Europeancountries are bought on the so-called secondary market byspeculators who want to collect the interest still paid on them bythe borrowers.   Speculators also hope that they can sell the debt at a higherprice or that some day the debtor government will pay in full.   Last July Polish debt was selling for as much as 41 cents on thedollar of the debt's original value. But Friday Polish debt wasselling at just 17.5 cents on the dollar, and the debts of Hungaryand Bulgaria have started to show signs of weakness.   The debt of Yugoslavia, a communist-ruled country outside theSoviet bloc, has been sharply devalued.   Keith Fogarty, managing director of Dillon, Read InternationalFinance, estimated that Poland owes $6 billion to $7 billion toprivate creditors in other countries. For the past few years thesedebts have been trading on the secondary market at 35 cents to 45cents on the dollar.   ``Then last fall the Poles sent out a telex saying they couldnot pay the full interest anymore _ only about 15 percent of it,''Fogarty said in an interview. The Poles said they pay the remainderof the interest later, but financial markets are dubious.   Fogarty said Poland has many other pressing needs for the hardforeign currency _ yen, dollars or West German marks _ in which theinterest must be paid. But it has few ways to earn that money.   It needs foreign currency, for example, to buy equipment forfarms that have been much neglected. Partly as a result of thatneglect, it has little food to sell. The United States and WesternEurope are sending relief shipments.   Other experts point out that the new Polish government, thefirst non-communist authority in Eastern Europe in 40 years, is ledby people who were active in the Solidarity trade union. They wouldnot want to be seen paying out large sums to financiers at a timewhen workers are being thrown out of jobs and paying high pricesfor necessities.   For their parts, the new governments in Poland and othercountries are eagerly freeing the prices of goods from traditionalcommunist controls and letting them find their own level on themarket.   The new governments hope the inevitable price rises will bringmore supplies. That would ease the equally traditional communistscarcity of food and other basic products.   The price of a loaf of bread in Poland, which has taken the leadin opening up to the market, has just gone up from the equivalentof 9 cents to 14 cents.   Most of the Polish and other East European debt being traded wasmoney lent by private banks in West Germany, France and Japan, witha small share from American bankers. Many of those bankers believedthe Soviet Union ultimately would be responsible for Polish debt,but in the early 1980s Moscow made it plain that it would not.   The Central Intelligence Agency estimated that the Soviet Unionowed $42.3 billion in the West at the end of 1988, about as much asPoland. But Soviet debts are not much traded.   Unlike Poland, Yugoslavia and many Third World countries theSoviet Union has always kept up with its payments _ it has vastresources of gold and petroleum that produce hard currency.   Yugoslav debt was selling Friday at 52.5 cents on the dollar,according to Dillon, Read.   Paul Masco, a trader at Salomon Brothers, said that Yugoslavdebt had sold for as little as 40 cents on the dollar. It rose to57 cents last fall, after the Yugoslav government started a programof buying some of it back in Yugoslav currency at pricesadvantageous to creditors. Now Yugoslavia is in trouble and theprice has fallen again.   Masco said Hungarian debt had been trading at par, but recentlyit fell to 98 cents or 99 cents on the dollar because of theexpectation that Hungary will want to borrow a lot more money.There is some doubt about the country's ability to handle a lot ofnew debt, he added.   According to the World Bank, Hungary already owed privatecreditors more than $13 billion at the end of 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
