DeLorean, OliverNorth, Roseanne Barr, and Jim Bakker and the PTL Gang&quot;)   Therefore, I was surprised to see that in your May 24editorial on this subject you stated that Justice Scalia's&quot;life is a fountain&quot; analogy was made &quot;the last time theSupreme Court heard a RICO case.&quot; That statement was made inH.J. Inc., et al., v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, etal., decided June 26, 1989.</LP><TEXT>   In fact, the Supreme Court has considered at least onesubsequent RICO case: Tafflin et al. v. Levitt et al, on Jan.22, 1990. In this amazing case -- it seems all RICO casedecisions are amazing -- the Supreme Court held that afederal civil RICO case can be brought in a state court]Thus, it no longer matters whether a state has its own &quot;baby&quot;RICO law.   Chief Justice Rehnquist, in remarks to the BrookingsInstitution and carried by your paper on May 19, 1989,stated: &quot;I do think that the imposition of some limitationson civil RICO actions is required so that federal courts arenot required to duplicate the efforts of state courts.&quot;Presumably such limitations would reduce the heavy workloadof the federal courts. However, this seems inconsistent withthe decision in Tafflin, that the plaintiff in a civil RICOaction may commence his action in state court (the Tafflindecision was 9-0, so Chief Justice Rehnquist concurred).   Perhaps the apparent inconsistency can be explained by thefact that both principles would reduce the number of RICOcases in federal courts.   Robert D. Hoagland   Charlotte, N.C.</TEXT></DOC>
