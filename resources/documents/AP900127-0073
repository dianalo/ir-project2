DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   ``Soft money,'' the kind that seeps throughthe limits in federal election campaign laws, flourished as neverbefore in the 1988 presidential race, a new survey shows.   And the results support claims by critics that many wealthydonors contributed the money with an eye to helping thepresidential candidates of their choice, thus getting aroundrestrictions imposed by federal law.   Federal law limits the size of individual contributions made tocandidates but puts no restriction on the size of ``soft''donations designed to help state party organizations registervoters and similar activities.   The Center for Responsive Politics sent its questionnaires todonors of soft money identified by the parties. Only 19 responded,a small fraction.   Eleven said their primary aim was support of presidentialcandidates.   Contributors were promised confidentiality in the survey lastyear and its results have not previously been released.   The center, a private bipartisan group that wants soft moneycontributions brought under federal control, made copies of thequestionnaires available to The Associated Press after deleting thedonors' names.   Soft money may not legally be used in campaigns for federaloffice. Critics, however, say it was widely used by both parties in1988 to evade the contribution limits and pump large amounts intokey presidential states.   Figures on exactly how much soft money was contributed are notavailable. The center, basing its figures on public disclosures bythe two national parties, has used a total of $45 million.   But that was brought into question by its own survey of reportsfiled under state disclosure laws in nine presidential battlegroundstates, which counted money received by state parties through theirnational committees and in direct donations. That survey showed$28.5 million in those states alone.   The Democratic National Committee said it received $11.6 millionin soft money in the three months before the election and disbursed$15.7 million.   One donor, who gave $100,000 to the Democratic NationalCommittee, told the center he was asked to contribute by Dukakis orhis fundraisers and intended his money to be used to support thenational Democratic ticket.   He said he had no intention of contributing to other activities,such as voter registration or get-out-the-vote drives. Others,donors of between $35,000 and $100,000 excluded from federallimits, gave similar answers.   Eight of those responding said they did want their contributionsto be used for such activities.   Thirteen of the donors said public disclosure of softcontributions should be required by law. Several also said theyshould be prohibited or restricted.   Fifteen gave to the Democratic party and four to the Republicanparty.   Fund-raisers for both parties defend their role in solicitingsoft money during the presidential campaign season.   ``I refuse to apologize for trying to create a level playingfield in 1988 for the first time with the Republicans,'' saidRobert Farmer, treasurer of the Democratic National Committee. Hesaid Republicans outspent Democrats heavily in the 1984 campaignthrough use of soft money.   ``I do not kid myself,'' Farmer said in an interview. ``Thereason such a flood of money comes in is because of thehigh-profile nature of a presidential campaign. But I think the useof the money is very clear. The fact of the matter is the money isused for party building activities.''   Farmer said party fundraisers working for Dukakis told him inthe heat of the campaign that ``we really need help in a key stateor two and if you are talking to anybody important and canencourage them to give directly to that state, that would behelpful.''   ``I know that some people were encouraged to give directly tostate parties at the end,'' Farmer said.   Former Republican National Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf said, ``TheDemocrats never had done it before 1988. The reason they did it waspretty clearly that they wanted to impact the presidential race. Wehad done it every year. It has an incidental benefit to thepresidential campaign, even though it is not designed that way.''   ``Anyone who followed what I did knows that my entire focus wasto build the local parties,'' Fahrenkopf said. ``But you are nevergoing to convince the people who believe it that every nickel ofsoft money isn't just a circuitous way to aid the presidentialcampaign.''   Congress is considering campaign reform legislation as part ofthe agenda for its forthcoming session.   ``I think the House and Senate are going to pass campaignfinance bills and I think as part of them we are going to deal withsoft money,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, theself-styled citizens lobby that advocates federal controls.   Ellen S. Miller, director of the Center for Responsive Politics,said she did not ``think the political signs are as optimistic asCommon Cause thinks. Members are so relucant to change a systemthat benefits them in so many ways.''   The Federal Election Commission will meet Jan. 24 to considernew rules for allocating funds between state and national partycommittees in presidential election years. Common Cause seeks tohave the FEC tighten its regulations, and the agency was ordered bya federal judge last year to speed up action on the matter.   A group of grass roots political activists, many of themveterans of the nuclear freeze movement, are also getting into theact. The Study Group on Electoral Democracy, based in Deerfield,Mass., will hold a conference Feb. 2-4 in Waveland, Miss., toexplore ways of generating public interest in campaign reform.   Randy Kehler, former national coordinator for the nuclear freezeproponents, said, ``The question is: can this issue, which tends tobe complex, boring, removed from everyday life, for most people, bemade into an issue that a significant number of the American peoplecan care about?''</TEXT></DOC>
