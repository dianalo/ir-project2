In fact, this distortion could beso severe that even a week's shut-in period may not allow a semilog analysis.A longer shut-in period becomes economically discouraging because oflost production. Low energy and low transmissivity in the reservoir,coupled with increased fluid compressibility, contribute to this long-durationstorage phenomenon. One way of reducing the storage effect clearly liesin the simultaneous analysis of downhole pressure and flow rate, estimatedfrom casinghead pressure and rising annular liquid-level measurementmade by acoustic well sounding (AWS). Ascertaining the quality of theindirectly measured pressure and rate data constitutes one of the objectivesof this study. Several methods exist to translate the AWS measurementto downhole pressure and rate data for the subsequent transient analysis.The authors show that even an empirical hydrodynamic correlation providessatisfactory transient-pressure/flow-rate data for convolution and deconvolutionanalyses for moderate pumping-liquid columns. When long annular liquidcolumns are encountered, translating the AWS measurement with a mechanisticallybased hydrodynamic model appears to be a prudent approach. Interpretationof several transient tests show that automated convolved-type-curve orhistory matching of field data is a powerful tool for reservoir-parameter(total mobility, skin, fracture half-length, and storage coefficient)estimation. A simple algorithm for computing the Laplace transform ofthe wellbore pressure for an infinite-conductivity vertically fracturedwell in an infinite reservoir is developed in this work for a rapid,iterative-type computation used in automated convolved-type-curve analysis.</TEXT></DOC>
