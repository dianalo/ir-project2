Albert Gore Jr., seeking to come on strong in his nativeSouth, renewed his attacks Sunday on Democratic presidential rivalsRichard Gephardt and Michael Dukakis. And Republican Bob Doleridiculed the vice president for pulling his campaign out of SouthDakota, demanding: ``Where's George Bush?''   South Dakota and Minnesota _ with campaign contests set Tuesday_ drew a cluster of GOP and Democratic contenders over the weekend.   GOP presidential hopeful Pat Robertson combined politicking andpreaching Sunday at a church dedication in Spartanburg, S.C.. Hetold 4,000 cheering supporters that the country must return to thereligious foundation ``upon which this country is laid.''   ``The government does not give freedom. That comes from God,''the former television evangelist said. ``We give the governmentwhat freedom we want to, not the other way around.''   Gephardt, who has made trade issues a campaign cornerstone, saidhe was undaunted by word that his House colleagues were planning toscuttle his trade amendment, which calls for sanctions againstcountries that maintain large trade surpluses with the UnitedStates.   ``We're going to dump it because it's bad policy,'' Rep. SamGibbons, D-Fla., a member of the House-Senate conference committeeworking on a compromise trade bill. But the Missouri congressman,in Watertown, S.D., vowed: ``I'm going to fight for my amendment.''   Gore, who sat out the Iowa caucuses that Gephardt won and stagedonly a limited effort in New Hampshire where Dukakis triumphed,blasted the two in a television interview, continuing a round ofattacks he kicked off at a Dallas debate on Thursday.   The Tennessee senator, appearing on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,''defended his aggressive tactics by paraphrasing Harry Truman.   ``I'm not giving them hell _ I'm just telling the truth and theythink it's hell,'' Gore said.   Gore, who has been attacking Gephardt for reversing positions onsome issues, picked up the theme again Sunday.   ``It's not a case of just having one or two or three issueswhere he has changed 180 degrees. There is a long, long list ofissues. You can't tell whether the views he is enunciating todayare the ones he will have tomorrow,'' Gore said of the Missouricongressman.   He said Dukakis, as governor of Massachusetts, has not had ``asingle day's experience in foreign policy, which shows in some ofthe statements he's made.''   That drew a swift reaction from the Dukakis campaign. ``AlGore's never had a day of experience balancing a budget or buildingan economy,'' said Leslie Dach, Dukakis' communications director.   Dukakis, who hopes to make the White House his home, attended ablack-tie dinner there Sunday night and was also to pay a visitMonday, when he and other members of the National Governors'Association meet with President Reagan.   On his way into the White House, Dukakis quipped to reporters,``I'm just looking the place over, that's all.'' Asked where hehoped to be next year, Dukakis replied, ``I hope right here.'   Gephardt, in South Dakota, was also anticipating taking upresidence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. ``When I'm president, you'regoing to have someone who understands the problems of SouthDakota,'' he said at a train depot in Aberdeen.   Democrat Paul Simon, stung by a second-place finish in Iowa anda third-place showing in New Hampshire, courted labor backing inLead, S.D. Later, at Mount Rushmore, he posed with the carvedvisages of four presidents as a backdrop.   ``There's one visible defect,'' he joked. ``Abraham Lincoln worebow ties all the time.'' Simon's bow ties are his trademark.   South Dakota, which has a primary on Tuesday, and Minnesota,which holds caucuses the same day, were fertile campaign ground onSunday.   Hart, who garnered almost no support in Iowa and New Hampshire,visited South Dakota's Pine Ridge Indian reservation, where he andhis wife, Lee, joined in a friendship dance with Oglala Siouxchildren. Hart told a crowd at a tribal building the United Statesshould honor treaty commitments to Indian tribes.   A poll in Sunday's editions of the Minneapolis Star Tribunesuggested Dole was the favorite among Minnesota Republicans andDukakis among Democrats. But the newspaper said the poll was notdesigned to be an indicator of the candidates' likely performance,because it was not confined to likely caucus-goers.   Dole campaigned Sunday in Wyoming, which holds caucuses March 5_ three days before Super Tuesday, when 20 states, most of them inthe South, have primaries and caucuses.   Bush, in the face of a strong Dole effort in South Dakota,decided last week to withdraw from the state _ a fact the Kansassenator made much of in a string of appearances on Sunday.   ``George Bush's decision to turn his back on America's heartlandis the mark of a regional candidacy that cannot win,'' Dole said inCasper, Wyo. ``Where is George Bush? He may run from the West andthe Midwest, but he can't hide in the South.''   In other developments:   _ A poll published in the Houston Chronicle and The DallasMorning News suggested the state's March 8 primary could prove tobe a tight race among Democrats. Dukakis drew the support of 27percent; 21 percent were unsure; 16 percent favored Jesse Jackson,15 percent backed Gephardt, 11 percent supported Gore, with sevenpercent choosing Hart and 2 percent favoring Simon.   Among Republicans, 66 percent favored Bush, while 12 percentsupported Dole; 11 percent favored Pat Robertson, and 10 percentwere unsure. In the poll, 736 voters were interviewed Feb. 17-18,and the margin of error was 4 percentage points.   _ Robertson, asked for comment on evangelist Jimmy Swaggartstepping down pending an investigation of allegations of sexualmisconduct, said he was ``running so hard for president I reallyhaven't had a chance to think much about it.''   _ Jackson, in Philadelphia, picked up the endorsement of MayorWilson Goode and Rep. William Gray III and appealed for donationsto buy air time in the Super Tuesday states. ``We have a message,but we need money to tell our story,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
