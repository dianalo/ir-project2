John Galvin, NATO's suprememilitary commander in Europe, said Tuesday the modernization ofshort-range nuclear missiles would permit a major cut in nuclearartillery.   ``I would like to see our alliance rely primarily on missilecapability for the nuclear side of it in the future,'' he toldreporters at his headquarters south of Brussels.   Galvin said he recently gave officials of the North AtlanticTreaty Organization a confidential report on the alliance's futurenuclear needs. It calls for ``a strong cut in artillery which wouldbe replaced by a dependence on missiles,'' he said.   ``In order to do that,'' he said, ``I have to have some missilesand that is the Lance, and the Lance today is very old.''   He declined to say how many artillery rounds might be reducedwith the upgrading of the Lance. NATO has more than 4,000 nuclearweapons based in its European arsenal. No breakdown is provided forartillery.   The upgrading of the Lance surface-to-surface missile has becomeone of the most controversial issues in the 16-nation Westernalliance.   Military analysts say the missile, introduced in 1972 with arange of about 75 miles, will become obsolete in 1995. Most of the700 missiles are deployed in West Germany and the remainder are inItaly. A proposed replacement for them would have a range of 320miles.   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker discussed the sensitive issuethis week with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has said hewants to delay a final decision on deployment of the new generationLance until 1991 or 1992.   The United States wants a firm commitment from the allies, onwhose soil the weapon would be deployed, before it presses Congressfor money to produce the missile. It has hoped for a strong signalthis spring.   Galvin said Congress needs to consider this year whether toprovide money to develop a model of the new Lance for test purposes.   ``If this has to be complete in the middle of the 1990s, then itneeds to start now ... 4{ years is not very much time,'' he said.   Galvin said the failure to upgrade the weapon would force thealliance ``to restudy our ability to carry out the currentstrategy.''   The issue of upgrading short-range nuclear arms has gainedprominence since former President Reagan and Soviet PresidentMikhail Gorbachev signed in December 1987 the Intermediate-rangeNuclear Forces treaty. It provides for eliminating all U.S. andSoviet land-based missiles with ranges of about 300 to 3,400 miles.   Strong anti-nuclear movements in Germany, the Netherlands andBelgium have opposed plans to modernize and extend the range of theLance missile.   Galvin said he would prefer that East-West negotiations onreducing conventional forces in Europe be finished beforediscussions begin on short-range nuclear arms. NATO and the sevenWarsaw Pact nations are to begin conventional force talks in earlyMarch in Vienna.   The NATO allies contend they need their nuclear arsenal as adeterrent, countering the huge superiority the Warsaw Pact maintainsin conventional, or non-nuclear, arms.   Kohl said Monday that Germany wants a disarmament mandate builtinto NATO strategy so that deployment plans would be stopped ifprogress is made on cutting the East's conventional arms.</TEXT></DOC>
