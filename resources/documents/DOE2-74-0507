And also a prototype of flexible light guidesfor solar light collection utilizing the PCS fibers were developed andits properties were compared with those utilizing conventional siliconresin clad PCS fibers. Higher numerical aperture (0.46-0.57) and lowerpower loss of transmitted light were obtained for the PCS fiber by usingfluoro resin with lower refractive index (1.340 - 1.385). The bundleof 5mm in outside diameter was fabricated with fluoro resin clad PCSfibers of 200{mu}m in core diameter and 7.5{mu}m of clad thickness, andshowed 66% core packing fraction which was increased by 1.38 times incomparison with conventional silicon clad PCS. Also, multi componentglass optical fibers for short distance light energy transmission anda rigid type light guide for dental use utilizing optical fibers weredeveloped.
