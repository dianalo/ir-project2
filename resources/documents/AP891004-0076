Jerry Falwell said evangelist Jim Bakkershouldn't blame him for the collapse of PTL because the damage tothe bankrupt ministry took place before he assumed control, anewspaper reported.   In an interview in today's editions of The Dallas Morning News,Falwell said he met Bakker for the first time when the PTL foundercalled him to Palm Springs, Calif., to turn over the ministry.Bakker resigned in a sex-and-money scandal in 1987.   ``I don't know a thing about the gentleman,'' Falwell said. ``Ithought he was a joke.''   Falwell made the comments in response to Bakker's testimony athis fraud trial in Charlotte, N.C., on Monday in which he accusedFalwell of cheating PTL followers.   Bakker also said Falwell and his attorney, Norman Roy Grutman,``threatened'' board members by telling them they ``might be liableto a civil suit.''   Falwell said that after he and his associates arrived at PTL andrealized the situation, Grutman told the PTL's board of directors``they had best get directly involved because they had personalcivil responsibilities.''   Falwell said he never met any of the PTL directors. But he saidhe called in Arthur Andersen andamp; Co., the accounting and managementconsulting firm, brought in attorneys and appointed ``a blue-ribbonpanel'' of directors from across the country.   ``I told them to conceal nothing, to tell the truth, to releaseall financial papers to the press and to immediately expose anyinequities or illegal activity,'' Falwell said. ``And they did it.''   Bakker is accused of plotting to swindle followers out of $158million and of using at least $3.7 million to support a lavishlifestyle. The ministry has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcyprotection from creditors.   Falwell, an evangelist from Lynchburg, Va., was in Dallas for aspeaking engagement Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
