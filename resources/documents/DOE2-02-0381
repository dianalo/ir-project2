An all-active scintillator detectorwas exposed to a muon-neutrino beam produced by five Coulombs of 800MeV protons on target. Oscillation events would have appeared as high-energyelectrons from the reaction {nu}/sub e/+C -andgt; e/sup -/+X. We also measuredcharged-current muon events in the detector to normalize our results.Our data show no evidence for neutrino oscillations and we place 90%CL upper limits on sin/sup 2/(2{theta} andless; 0.008 at {Delta}/sup 2/ = 11eV/sup 2/, and {Delta}/sup 2/ andless; 0.67 eV/sup 2/ for complete mixing.</TEXT></DOC>
