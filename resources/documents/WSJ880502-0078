Officials said further talks will be held in June and August.    Taiwan refused to reduce tariffs on about 60 agricultural products or to lift import bans on peanuts, poultry and animal organs. It denied a U.S. request that a five-year bilateral agreement to limit Taiwan's rice exports be renewed next year.    Representatives of the Asian nation also called for the scrapping of a 1986 agreement that allows local magazines to advertise U.S. cigarettes, asserting the accord promotes smoking and hurts local tobacco growers. U.S. officials rejected the request.    Taiwan did, however, promise to review a U.S. proposal that tariffs be cut on about 110 industrial products.    Although Taiwan agreed to take measures to curb the rampant infringement of U.S. intellectual property rights, it differed with the U.S. on major details. Taiwan agreed in principle that translations require permission from the U.S. authors but opposed making the agreement retroactive. </TEXT></DOC>
