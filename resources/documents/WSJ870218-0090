As reported previously, Viacom, a cable-television and broadcasting concern, last week rejected a $3.1 billion proposal by Arsenal Holdings, a National Amusements unit, saying it &quot;was not more favorable&quot; than a Viacom management-led leveraged buyout that directors approved earlier.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arsenal said Viacom agreed to provide it with certain confidential company information. National Amusements declined further comment, but one Wall Street executive said the company asked for the information from Viacom &quot;to evaluate whether they can make a better offer.&quot;    National Amusements, a closely held Dedham, Mass., theater chain, has also raised objections with the Federal Communications Commission over Viacom's handling of filings with that agency, which are required by law when a broadcasting and cable-television concern changes hands.    Viacom has argued that the management offer is more likely to succeed than National Amusements' because it is close to receiving FCC and other approvals, which the company maintains would take National Amusements six months or more to get. But National Amusements claims that Viacom's filings with the agency should be invalidated because the company has changed a number of items in its own leveraged buyout proposal since its initial filing. National Amusements argued that the FCC should force Viacom to restart the filing process as a result.    The FCC hasn't yet responded to National Amusements' request. Viacom declined to comment.    Arsenal also said in its filing with the SEC that it agreed, as part of the arrangement with Viacom, that it wouldn't buy any more Viacom stock, except through a tender offer for at least 50% of the shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. The agreement would only stand, however, if the management-led group made a similar pledge by 5 p.m. yesterday, the filing said.    National Amusements currently is Viacom's largest shareholder with a 19.6% stake.    It isn't known why Viacom directors rejected National Amusements' bid last week. But sources close to the company said Viacom questioned National Amusements' ability to raise financing and disagreed with Wall Street estimates of the value of the National Amusements offer. The National Amusements proposal consisted of $37.50 a share in cash, a partial share of a new issue of preferred valued at $7.25 and an equity stake in a new company that arbitragers valued at $4.50 a share, giving the bid a total value of $49.25 a share.    The National Amusements offer provided 50 cents more in cash and 25 cents more in preferred than the Viacom management offer. The management-led proposal also includes an equity stake in a new company, which artitragers had valued at $3 a share, giving that bid a total value of $47 a share.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Viacom stock closed at $44.125, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
