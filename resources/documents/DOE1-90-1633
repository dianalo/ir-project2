It is marked that conditions, when IDFs differing fromMaxswell ones are formed due to drift motions or additional plasma heating,often occur. It affects considerably ion heat transfer in the tokamak.The problem on studying directly IDFs in tokamaks, and not only characteristicsaveraged for the whole distribution such as the ion temperature arises.From this point of view possibilities of ion diagnosis methods in thetokamak are considered. They are: recharging atom flow analysis; neutronflow measurements; neutron energy spectrum analysis, measurements ofthe Doppler expansion of ion and atom spectrum lines. Some experimentalresults illustrating possibilities of IDF investigation in space, energyand velocity space are given.</TEXT></DOC>
