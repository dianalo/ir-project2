(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sugar cane harvesters have filed alawsuit claiming they have been underpaid by more than $30 millionduring the past six seasons by south Florida growers.   The lawsuit, filed Monday as an amended class-action to includemore than 10,000 workers who have worked for six companies since1982, alleges that sugar cane harvesters were not given propercredit for the amount of cane cut.   The original lawsuit was filed in Palm Beach County CircuitCourt in August on behalf of four Jamaican farmworkers. In aseparate action Monday, the growers filed a motion to dismiss theoriginal lawsuit.   Defendants named in the suit are the Sugar Cane GrowersCooperative, Atlantic Sugar Association, United States Sugar Corp.,Okeelanta Corp., Osceola Farms and Cane Contractors.   Under the federal government's guest-worker program, growers canhire foreign cane cutters if the companies can show there are notenough U.S. citizens willing to work for the minimum task rate of$5.30 for each ton cut. Growers then submit to several stateemployment centers ``clearance orders'' that explain the work, therate of pay and how much work is expected each day.   The clearance orders cited in the suit stated that workers wereto average one ton per hour for eight hours a day, according to JimGreen, a lawyer for the cane-cutters.   For that work, according to the clearance orders, harvesterswere to be paid at a rate of $5.30 a ton, the attorney said. Thelawsuit claims the workers received $3.50 per ton and $4.25 per ton.   But Charles Caulkins, an attorney for the growers, said the sixcompanies contend the clearance order calls for payment per hour,not per ton.</TEXT></DOC>
