A 40-year-old man suffering a severe liver disease had suddenly developed a life-threatening skin condition.    &quot;His skin was sloughing off all over his body,&quot; recalls Marshall M. Kaplan, the Tufts University gastroenterologist who had been tending the patient's liver problems.    Cortisone wasn't helping, &quot;so the question came up whether methotrexate would help,&quot; Dr. Kaplan says. Methotrexate is an old anti-cancer drug that had been found to aid certain other skin conditions, but it also has a dangerous side effect -- liver damage. The idea of using this drug in a man with a diseased liver was &quot;frightening,&quot; Dr. Kaplan says. &quot;But if we didn't use it, there was a good chance he would die from the skin condition.&quot;    Balancing the risks, doctors began giving the man methotrexate. &quot;We watched his blood tests (for signs of liver damage), fully expecting them to get worse,&quot; Dr. Kaplan says. Instead, not only did his skin condition clear up, but to the doctors' astonishment, his liver began to improve. Now, eight years later, he takes maintenance doses of methotrexate, and both his skin and liver are normal.    THIS EPISODE, recently published in Annals of Internal Medicine, marks another serendipitous incident in the strange history of methotrexate. In these days when genetic engineering and molecular manipulation turn up new wonder drugs almost weekly, methotrexate stands out as a baffling technological anomaly. In the 40 years since the drug was first synthesized, it has been alternately lauded as a treatment for a variety of human scourges and castigated as a poison whose risks are greater than the diseases it's being used to treat. Yet no one is quite sure how or why it does what it does.    The methotrexate story begins in the mid-1940s when the late Sidney Farber and his colleagues at Children's Hospital in Boston were attempting the first use of chemicals in the treatment of acute childhood leukemia, then an invariably fatal blood cancer.    The cancer researchers, according to an oft-told story, had noticed a similarity between the leukemia and a certain anemia which was due to a deficiency of the vitamin folic acid. This led them to treat the leukemia with folic acid. To their horror, the folic acid accelerated the leukemia instead of retarding it. This near-disaster, however, led them to try a second chemical, called aminopterin, that blocked the cancer cells' use of folic acid. In 1948, in an historic research paper, the Boston researchers reported the first remissions of acute leukemia through chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the remissions lasted only a few weeks or months.    The Boston discovery led chemists at Lederle Laboratories, the pharmaceutical subsidiary of American Cyanamid Co., to synthesize an improved version of aminopterin they called a-methopterin, to which Lederle's marketing people affixed the brand name, Methotrexate (the brand name has since slid into generic use).    METHOTREXATE PROVED even better at bringing about remissions of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and today it is one of the drugs achieving cures of leukemia in about 50% of afflicted children. By 1956, cancer researchers reported another first: Women developing an unusual cancer of the placenta during pregnancy had been permanently cured by methotrexate, the first cancer ever cured by chemotherapy.    In the early 1960s, serendipity struck again. A New York dermatologist reported instances of some patients being relieved of psoriasis, a chronic and severely disturbing skin disease, when treated with methotrexate. This led William O'Brien and Roger Black at the National Institutes of Health to run a controlled trial on 21 psoriasis patients. Not only did the skin disorder clear up in several patients but so did a type of arthritis that often accompanies psoriasis. The scientists then reported a second trial showing that methotrexate produced remissions in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the most common form of the crippling disorder.    But, in treating psoriasis patients, the dangers of methotrexate became apparent. In high doses and daily use, the drug can cause severe liver damage and sometimes a lung disorder.    IN SOME CANCER PATIENTS, doctors have worked out a unique &quot;rescue&quot; concept, giving a patient dangerously high doses of methotrexate to kill cancer cells and then shortly afterward administering an antidote to save normal tissues from its poisonous effects.    Methotrexate's use in arthritis, at least for patients whose disease isn't helped by any other drug, is now being revived. Researchers have treated several hundred arthritis patients with low doses of methotrexate given only once a week. Anywhere from half to two-thirds of these patients improve; some have remissions of their arthritis. But while many arthritis specialists are using methotrexate in &quot;refractory&quot; patients, others shun it. One is Dr. O'Brien, who did the first trial of methotrexate in arthritis and who is now a professor at the University of Virginia. Because of its toxicity, he says, &quot;we don't use it anymore here in Charlottesville.&quot;    Meanwhile, in Boston, Dr. Kaplan and his colleagues say they had a second patient with the same severe liver disease as the first but without the skin problem. &quot;He was at his wits' end,&quot; Dr. Kaplan says. &quot;I thought of that first patient and said, 'If you're a gambler and you want to try methotrexate, we'll do it.'&quot; The patient's liver is now normal. A clinical trial of methotrexate in the liver disease, called primary sclerosis cholangitis, is now under way. </TEXT></DOC>
