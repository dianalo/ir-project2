But it also closed saloons for two days and put the military on &quot;double red alert.&quot;    The seemingly contradictory preparations are a measure of the fiesta atmosphere and the deadly seriousness that surround any election in the Philippines, and this one perhaps more than most.    The new constitution isn't likely to bring a quick fix to the Philippines' myriad economic and political problems. Indeed, Filipinos predict another politically tumultuous year ahead. Peace talks have broken down with the Communist insurgents, and a face-off between President Corazon Aquino and her fractious military seems certain in the wake of another failed coup attempt last week.    But the constitution's passage will show that Mrs. Aquino still has overwhelming popular support that she can call upon if her authority is challenged. It will show that her moderate followers still control the revolution they staged a year ago. And if it doesn't dry up her left-wing and right-wing opposition, at least it will rob both sides of many of the issues they have used to undermine her rule.    The draft constitution has provisions on abortion, the death penalty, the U.S. military bases, nuclear weapons and hundreds of other matters. The only real issue, though, is Mrs. Aquino. She has turned the vote into a test of her own popularity by heartily campaigning for the new law, which gives her another six years in office.    Passage hasn't ever been in doubt. For one thing, politics rivals basketball as the national sport here, and elections can't be called or a National Assembly seated until a constitution is passed. But just as important, the Philippines has a strong constitutional tradition -- in 1898 it became the first country in Asia to pass a constitution -- and nothing has rankled Filipinos more since Mrs. Aquino took power than her decision to abolish the old basic law, declare a revolutionary government and rule by decree.    The constitutional cause got an added boost, however, when renegade military men attempted to seize several army bases and television stations last week in an apparent bid by former President Ferdinand Marcos to return from exile.    The widely televised rebellion portrayed the plotters as crazy and manipulated, and the Aquino government as reasonable, firm and in control. &quot;The more likely it became that the constitution would pass, the more likely it became that something like this would occur,&quot; says Fred Whiting, former president of the American Chamber of Commerce here.    &quot;The expected happened and she handled it.&quot;    Moreover, the attempt rallied political moderates to the constitution. Some of Mrs. Aquino's advisers, who were predicting last week that the constitution would win 55% of the vote, now are expecting 70% when the count is finished, probably on Wednesday or Thursday. Anything less than 60% would probably be regarded as a political setback for the president.    In theory, at least, such a huge majority would made it easier for Mrs. Aquino to deal with her critics.    On the right, it would undercut the charges of Marcos loyalists and such other opponents as former Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile that Mrs. Aquino's government is &quot;illegitimate&quot; and undemocratic. Those charges have helped fuel at least five attempted coups against the president, and have given the military &quot;justification for their intransigence&quot; toward her, says Blas Ople, a former Marcos cabinet member.    For the left, a huge turnout for the constitution would weaken charges that Mrs. Aquino, who comes from the landed Philippine nobility, doesn't represent the popular will. The left, which broke off peace talks with the government last week, would itself be shown as out of touch with the masses.    Moreover, the Communist insurgency that has raged here for 17 years has been fueled in part by the left's charges that local political leaders -- often Marcos yes-men who never left Manila -- didn't represent the people. The constitution, by providing for new local elections, should &quot;restore credible local government&quot; and in that way undermine the insurgency, says U.S. Ambassador Stephen Bosworth.    But even Mrs. Aquino's admirers concede that the constitution isn't likely to end the turmoil here. &quot;Politicians will always come up with new political issues,&quot; says Christian Monsod, a member of the commission that drafted the new constitution.    The constitution's passage won't presage a flood of new business here either, despite Mrs. Aquino's reasoning that it sets out investment guidelines, and a moribund economy is further grist for the insurgents' cause.    &quot;I don't think an investor will zero in on the constitution as the big green light,&quot; says Mr. Whiting. Adds Eduardo Angara, president of the University of the Philippines: &quot;Investors want stability, and that's like a moving milestone.&quot;    By setting the scene for National Assembly elections in May and for municipal elections in August, moreover, the constitution assures another year of political turmoil. Philippine election campaigns are long, noisy, expensive and bloody.    Mrs. Aquino's most immediate problem is a brewing confrontation with the military, and until that is settled, adds Mr. Angara, &quot;even the constitution won't matter&quot; in attempting to restore stability.    The president, who was conciliatory and forgiving after previous coup attempts, has demanded the court-martial of the latest plotters. Her chief of staff, General Fidel Ramos, began a weekend roundup of officers and enlisted men implicated in the coup attempt, but political observers predict he'll face a split in the ranks if he attempts to mete out punishment.    The military &quot;feels orphaned in the policy councils&quot; of the Aquino government, which widely mistrusts the army for its role in enforcing Mr. Marcos's rule by martial law, says Mr. Ople, the former cabinet minister. The new constitution, even though it asserts civilian control of the army, isn't likely to change that attitude.    But a huge vote for the constitution would show that Mrs. Aquino still commands enormous popular support that she can mobilize in the event of a crisis. And if a constitution won't immediately ease the Philippines's jitters, a show of strength by Mrs. Aquino possibly will. </TEXT></DOC>
