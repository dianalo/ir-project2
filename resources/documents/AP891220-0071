For the next 4{ hours, the men held us hostage, told us abouttheir comrades who had already fallen in the battle and threatenedto kill us.   ``A lot of Panamanians have died, and we can kill you,'' one ofthem told New York Times correspondent Lindsey Gruson. ``Don'tthink we won't.''   I had just checked into the hotel and come down to the sunkenterrace when I saw armed men running in a crouched position by theswimming pool. Right about the same time I heard gunfire.   It was about midnight, and the U.S. assault had started.   I made for the hotel's main building with several otherreporters when a man with an assault rifle appeared and said, `Hitthe floor.'   He herded us over into the lobby, which was full of people.   The gunmen took peoples' passports, they searched my bag.   About a dozen of the men took charge of me and 11 otherforeigners, including two other correspondents.   I never saw more than 20 armed men in the hotel.   They told us they had surrounded the building. `We're beinginvaded, so we're taking hostages,' the man who appeared to betheir leader said.   They did not threaten me personally, but they made it clear thatthey could kill us all. There were about eight Americans in ourgroup.   Gruson and I tried to persuade the men to let us call ouroffices to tell the story of the invasion.   We saw them herding the guests and staff into the grandballroom. A man in a silk bathrobe kept saying to the captors,``I'm Chilean! I'm Chilean!''   The armed men eventually let me retrieve my bag and notebook _my money had been taken _ and they let me remain in the lobby.   Gruson went upstairs where he said he was threatened by one ofthe gunmen, who kept pointing his assault rifle at him. At onepoint, the gunman put the muzzle of his weapon against Gruson'smouth, he told me later.   About 1:45 a.m., a few other hostages and I were herded into ared van at gunpoint and driven to a private home in the wealthyneighborhood where the Panmanian leader, Gen. Manuel AntonioNoriega, lives. We were ordered into the service area off thekitchen and made to sit on the floor.   Our captors let us have water and smoke cigarettes.   We were there until 4 a.m. I kept hearing aircraft passing lowoverhead, sporadic gunfire from automatic weapons. Things weretapering off.   Between 3:30 a.m. and 4 a.m., the phone rang three times.   More hostage-takers showed up. Then a man who appeared to betheir leader said, ``We're going to let you go. We don't want tokill you. Tell the truth about Panama. We're not killers.''   ``There are hundreds of dead in the Central Barracks.''   The men seemed very sad. One was crying.   They put us back into a van and let us out in the street. Iraced to a private home and called the AP office.</TEXT></DOC>
