Following the commission's meeting Friday, Mr. Trump'slawyers said they doubted the delay would cause any of about90 banks participating in Mr. Trump's restructuring towithdraw approval.</LP><TEXT>   Should the commission reject the bailout tomorrow, it willcome as a major surprise and a setback to Mr. Trump who,documents prepared by his accounting firm show, needs the $65million to continue day-to-day operations.   If the bank deal is completed, Mr. Trump is expected nextto tackle a restructuring of $1.3 billion in casino bonds heissued to finance his Atlantic City empire. &quot;I expect warwith the bondholders,&quot; Mr. Trump said Friday. &quot;But I thinkthings will work out well for both sides.&quot;   For Mr. Griffin, the commission's action marks a possibleturning point in his ill-fated foray into the casinobusiness. Mr. Griffin purchased Resorts in 1988 after atakeover battle with Mr. Trump. Within less than a year, thecompany failed to make interest payments on about $925million in junk bond debt and was forced to seekbankruptcy-law protection. Adding to Mr. Griffin's troubles,Mr. Trump was quoted frequently saying he had bested Mr.Griffin in their negotiations.   Included in the Resorts plan is a $5 million litigationtrust fund to pursue possible lawsuits against Mr. Trumpstemming from the Resorts sale.   Mr. Griffin said he harbored no animosity toward Mr. Trumpand wished him well through his current troubles. &quot;The ironyof the whole thing is that it boiled down to today, in thesame room,&quot; Mr. Griffin said. &quot;How did he end up in suchtrouble in the morning and me in such great shape in theafternoon?&quot;   Mr. Griffin will pay a significant price for getting outof bankruptcy-law protection. Under the restructuring planput together by Salomon Brothers Inc., Mr. Griffin will cedeabout 78% of the equity in the company to bondholders and putup an additional $28.5 million. As part of its plan, thecompany intends to sell its Paradise Island property in theBahamas.   In addition to the new equity, some bondholders willreceive deferred interest notes that will alleviate thecompany's debt burden and allow it to accumulate cash.   &quot;They're not out of the woods yet, but the deal will helpstabilize the company,&quot; said Kaye Handley, an analyst withSass Lamle andamp; Rubin who specializes in distressed securities.</TEXT></DOC>
