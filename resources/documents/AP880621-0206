KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Twenty senators have told the Reaganadministration they are concerned that a proposed sale ofsophisticated U.S. fighters, missiles and munitions to Kuwait maypose a threat to Israel and would further fuel the Middle East armsrace.   In a letter to Secretary of State George P. Shultz, the senatorsquestioned the reasoning behind the sale decision, asking whetherKuwait has agreed to give more active protection to its ownshipping in the Persian Gulf.   The letter was sent to Shultz on Friday and was made publicTuesday.   The arms sale package includes 40 F@A-18 Hornet fighteraircraft, 40 Harpoon missiles, 120 Sidewinder missiles, 300Maverick missiles, 200 Sparrow missiles, 400 laser-guided bombs and200 cluster bombs.   The senators said they are concerned that the combat-range ofthe Hornet could be extended to permit attacks on Israel by basingit in Saudi Arabia, Jordan or Iraq or by adding larger fuel tanks.   ``Accordingly, we conclude that it is critically important tohave the assurances of Kuwait that these aircraft will never bebased or deployed closer to Israel than they would be at their basein Kuwait and that they never will be based in or based to a statebordering Israel,'' the senators said.   They asked for assurances that Kuwait will not seek and the U.S.government will not sell equipment to extend the range of theplanes.   Additionally, they said they are concerned that the highlyaccurate and reliable Maverick missile might ``fall into unfriendlyhands.''   ``The Maverick has destructive capabilities that far exceed thelegitimate security requirements of Kuwait,'' the senators said andadded: ``We cannot afford to have our most sophisticated, sensitiveand efficient weapons sold without predictable and desirableconsequences.''   The letter was signed by Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairmanof the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and these other senators:   Sens. Dennis De Concini, D-Ariz; Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J.;Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.; Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii; Paul Sarbanes,D-Md.; Bob Packwood, R-Ore.; Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.;Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.; Pete Wilson, R-Calif.; John Kerry,D-Mass.   Also, Sens Paul Simon, D-Ill.; Brock Adams, D-Wash.; Howard W.Metzenbaum, D-Ohio; Terry Sanford, D-N.C.; Alfonse M. D'Amato,R-N.Y.; Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich.; Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.; QuentinN.
