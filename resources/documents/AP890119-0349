(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state treasury has canceled a $110million commitment to the company acquiring RJR Nabisco Inc. becauseof Michigan's new law banning investments in business with ties toSouth Africa.   Foes of South Africa's race-segregation system said Thursday theywelcomed the decision a day earlier by State Treasurer Robert Bowmanto scrap the investment in a fund run by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp;Co., the firm buying RJR in a takeover valued at a record $24.53billion.   ``I think it's a courageous decision in line with the spirit ofthe legislation,'' said state Rep. Perry Bullard, one of thesponsors of the measure banning South African-related investments.   RJR, a food-and-tobacco giant with products ranging from Oreocookies to Salem cigarettes, agreed to sell itself to Kohlberg latelast year.   Based in Atlanta, RJR is one of 95 U.S. companies with SouthAfrican involvement, according to a list Bowman compiled incompliance with the law which took effect Jan. 1.   The measure bans new investments of state pension funds incompanies involved in South Africa until that white-ruled nationdrops its policy of racial segregation known as apartheid or untilthe companies sever their ties with the country.   It also requires the $16 billion pension fund to sell off overthe next five years the $5 billion in investments it holds in SouthAfrican-involved companies.   Bullard and state Sen. Virgil Smith, D-Detroit, another sponsorof the divestiture measure, said they had talked privately to Bowmanand argued against the Kohlberg investment.   ``My reaction is a positive one,'' Smith said. ``He did what Iwanted him to do.''   Bowman's decision makes Michigan the second state to back out ofparticipating in Kohlberg's fund for the acquisition of RJR.Massachusetts withdrew earlier.   Kohlberg officials referred inquiries to its public relationscompany, Kekst and Co., in New York, but officials there didn'treturn three telephone calls seeking reaction to the Michigandecision.   The apartheid foes' praise of Bowman was in contrast to thecriticism they heaped on the treasurer when he decided to invest$335 million in South African-involved companies shortly before thedivestiture law took effect Jan. 1.   Treasury spokesman Robert Kolt said the two situations weredifferent because the state had completed those purchases before theinvestment ban took effect.   ``We haven't actually released the money yet (to Kohlberg), whichwould take place after the law took effect so that's the problem,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
