Health and Human Services Secretary Otis Bowen testified yesterday before the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment that the provisions against discrimination &quot;would create a burdensome new federal administrative enforcement bureaucracy (that would not be) used to protect the rights of persons with any other disease or handicap.&quot;    Dr. Bowen also objected to provisions of the bill that would increase funding for AIDS counseling and testing and establish federal rules for confidentiality.    But his testimony didn't include an administration threat to veto the bill if it gains House and Senate approval. Subcommittee Chairman Henry Waxman, a Los Angeles Democrat, said Dr. Bowen's statement didn't &quot;close the door&quot; on administration cooperation with Congress on the legislation. The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee is considering a similar bill.    The secretary conceded that employment, education and housing discrimination against those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome has occurred, but he said, &quot;if a state concludes that such additional protections are or are not in the interest of its people . . . then it should be free to act accordingly,&quot; he said.    The legislation is designed to encourage widespread testing and counseling of those in high risk groups such as homosexuals and intravenous drug users. It would provide $400 million for increased testing and counseling in each of three fiscal years beginning Oct. 1.    The confidentiality rules would prohibit release of test information on individuals, except in certain limited cases. The rules would apply to all AIDS tests, whether or not financed with federal funds. The anti-discrimination portion of the measure wouldn't apply to those who pose a risk to public health or those too ill to work.    Rep. Waxman and the secretary agreed on the need for increased testing, confidentiality and anti-discrimination tools. But Rep. Waxman said waiting for some states to act could take years, during which time thousands wouldn't be tested.    Confidentiality and protection from discrimination are necessary, Mr. Waxman said, because without it people fear that AIDS testing can lead to actions against them. Despite administration opposition to the bill, he expects congressional approval. &quot;We clearly have widespread bipartisan support,&quot; he added.    However, in an interview, Rep. William Dannemeyer (R., Calif.) also opposed the anti-discrimination portion of the bill, which he said &quot;isn't going anywhere.&quot; He said it presents a conflict between the rights of those infected and those who don't have the illness. It's a &quot;more rational decision to protect the public health than to protect the civil rights of those who have the virus,&quot; he said.    Rep. Ronald Wyden (D., Ore.) said the $90 million HHS will spend in the next fiscal year for counseling and testing would serve just a small fraction of the 17 million people the subcommittee estimates are at high risk for AIDS. </TEXT></DOC>
