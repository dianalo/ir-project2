Meanwhile, United Telecommunications Inc.'s profit plunged22%, as the margin at its US Sprint long-distance unit failedto improve for the third straight quarter. Southwestern BellCorp.'s profit dropped 9.6%, while Ameritech's slid 6.8%.Only Pacific Telesis Group managed to eke out an increase,1.5%.</LP><TEXT>   The results &quot;are fairly indicative&quot; of the entire group ofregional Bell telephone companies, says analyst Jack Grubmanof PaineWebber Inc., who sees the weakness in access-linegrowth keeping a lid on earnings for much of the year. Hesays, however, that the companies' cellular businesses showedfairly robust growth.                                                                                                          United Telecommunications                                                                                                          United Telecom, based in Kansas City, Mo., continued to beplagued by the weak performance of its US Sprint unit. Thesubsidiary, in which United Telecom holds an 80.1% stake,continues to have trouble expanding margins, says EdGreenberg of Morgan Stanley. In the first quarter, operatingprofit plunged 39% from the previous year to $52 millionalthough revenue at the unit rose 8.3%. Operating expensesrose 14% to $1.29 billion.   However, Sprint reported strong traffic volume growth of4.7% from the fourth quarter. The rate is slower than the5.8% registered in the fourth quarter from the third quarter,but much better than the two previous consecutive-quartermoves.   Operating profit at its local telecommunications divisionalso declined, to $167 million from $169 million in the 1990first quarter. Its revenue edged up 4% to $688 million from$662 million.   Its complementary businesses, including thetelecommunications equipment and yellow pages operations,registered a 27% profit increase to $14 million from $11million. Revenue fell 2.5% to $196 million.   Overall, revenue rose 6.8% to $2.16 billion from $2.02billion.

Southwestern Bell                                                                                                          The St. Louis-based company was hurt by a 15% earningsdecline at Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., its largestsubsidiary. Edward E. Whiteacre Jr., chairman and chiefexecutive officer, also cited a $26 million one-time gain ininterstate access earnings in the 1990 first quarter.   Mr. Whiteacre said 1991 first-quarter earnings were hurtby a Texas regulatory plan that took effect late last yearand resulted in significant reductions in the rate charged tocustomers. He also said the Federal Communications Commissionrequired the company to reduce interstate access charges.These factors contributed to a $37.5 million drop in thesubsidiary's first-quarter profit.   In the quarter, Southwestern Bell Telephone added morethan 90,000 access lines. While that represents a significantrecovery from the fourth quarter, when the company added only15,000 lines, it's below the 115,000-line gain in the 1990first quarter.   Southwestern Bell said its non-regulated operations alsoshowed strong growth, with Southwestern Bell Mobile Systemsadding 64,000 new customers, up from 59,000 in the 1990 firstquarter. It now serves 731,000 cellular customers in 28markets.

Pacific Telesis                                                                                                          Pacific Telesis, based in San Francisco, said its PacificBell unit had a 1.2% profit increase to $245 million from$242 million. Pacific Bell's revenue rose 1.9% to $2.16billion; overall, revenue rose 1.7% to $2.41 billion.Operating expenses, meanwhile, edged up 2.2%.   Access line growth for both Pacific Bell and the muchsmaller Nevada Bell unit remained slow. The number of accesslines inched up 0.7% to 14.2 million from 14.1 million in thefourth quarter of 1990. That compares with access line growthin the fourth quarter of 3.3% and 1% in the first quarter of1990.   The outlook at its Pactel Cellular subsidiary wasbrighter, with profit climbing 21% to $20.5 million from$16.9 million. Revenue jumped 16% to $156 million, as Pactelincreased its customer base to 543,000 subscribers, up 31.5%from the year before. However, because of the weaker economy,average revenue per customer dropped 12.5% to $91 from $104.
