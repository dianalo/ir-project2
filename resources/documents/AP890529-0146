Gorbachev on Monday to agree to deep American and Soviettroop withdrawals from Europe, and NATO ministers later worked outa compromise on missile negotiations that had threatened to dividethe Western alliance.   NATO leaders welcomed Bush's plan for across-the-boardreductions in conventional forces, which would limit the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union to 275,000 troops each in Europe. Bushsaid he wants the proposal put on the fast track for treaty talksin Vienna.   The NATO ministers worked past midnight to forge theircompromise on the short-range missile question.   A senior U.S. official said it provides for U.S.-Sovietnegotiations to reduce, but not eliminate, the battlefield nuclearweapons in both the NATO and Warsaw alliances. The short-rangenuclear cutbacks would be linked to the East-West talks in Viennato reduce troops, tanks, artillery and other conventional weapons.   The official stressed the negotiations on missiles could notbegin, however, until an accord was reached to reduce thoseconventional forces and the two alliances had actually started tocarry out those cutbacks.   And the nuclear cutbacks could not start until the conventionalcuts were finished, said the official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   This represented a partial victory both for West German and theUnited States, whose division over the missile issue threatened theunity of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the two-day40th anniversary summit itself.   The United States won a major concession from Bonn in that thecommunique is to call for partial reductions in the short-rangemissiles _ but not their total elimination. Bush said earlier hewould never agree to eliminate all battlefield nuclear missilesfrom Europe.   Bush said he hoped NATO and the Warsaw Pact could work out atreaty in six months to a year and implement it by 1992 or 1993.   If that blueprint is followed in Vienna, the missiles, with arange of up to 310 miles, would not be reduced for three or fouryears.   ``It worked out very well from our point of view,'' the officialtold the Associated Press.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign MinistersHans-Dietrich Genscher, for their part, won U.S. acceptance of theproposition that there be negotiations with the Soviets to reducethe weapons.   The draft, which still requires the approval of Bush, Kohl andthe 14 other Allied leaders, straddles another contentious issue bycalling for keeping the missiles up to date, but not specificallysaying when they should be modernized.   The United States and Britain wanted to more than triple therange of 88 U.S.-built Lance launchers to just under 300 miles,while the West Germans opposed making the weapons more powerful.The official said the British, the most ardent supporters of amissile deterrent to Soviet attack, still had some ``reservations''about the tentative accord, but he gave no details.   A British foreign ministry spokesman called it ``a text close toan agreement.'' Genscher told reporters early Tuesday, ``It has tobe confirmed by the prime ministers, but it includes thecomprehensive concept and short-range forces negotiations.''   Jurgen Chrobog, a West German spokesman, called it an agreement``with a reservation'' by the British. The British spokesman, whoasked not to be identified, refused to comment on that.   The ministers cancelled a formal dinner and met until 1 a.m.Brussels time (7 p.m. EDT) before producing language Chrobog saidthe Germans were ``very satisfied'' with.   Earlier, Bush called his own proposals ``bold'' and said hewanted to put Gorbachev's initiatives ``to the test.''   Having dismissed some of the Soviet leader's measures as showybut insubstantial, Bush said to Moscow: ``We're out there now witha proposal that the United States puts forward, and that haswidespread alliance support. Now test it. How serious are you? Doyou really want to reduce the imbalances that exist in all thesecategories, or do we want rhetoric?''   Bush sent a letter to Gorbachev on Sunday outlining the proposaland he told reporters he would make Secretary of State James A.Baker III available for talks with the Soviet leader or ForeignMinister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to be held ``the sooner thebetter.''   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Bush'sconventional weapons plan ``transformed the summit.'' Kohlcongratulated Bush for a ``far-sighted'' proposal on non-nuclearforces.   At the end of the afternoon working session, officials fromvarious countries said the leaders had adopted the Bush initiativein principle and would endorse it in their final statement onTuesday.   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's proposal, accepted bythe leaders, calls for NATO experts to consider the Bush offer for60 to 90 days and work out a detailed negotiating position beforeputting it before the Warsaw Pact in negotiations in Vienna.   There was no formal response from the Soviet government but theSoviet news agency Tass issued a brief dispatch saying ``the newproposals were made by Washington after the Bush administrationcame under serious criticism from the public for the lack of anydisarmament initiatives at a time when the Soviet Union haslaunched a `peace offensive.'''   With his proposal, Bush deflected attention from the differenceswithin the alliance.   He said his plan involves a 20 percent cutback in U.S. combattroops. It would reduce overall U.S. troop strength in Europe byabout 10 percent. There are about 150,000 U.S. combat troops inEurope and more than 150,000 support forces.   The Soviets have an estimated 625,000 troops in Eastern andCentral Europe. Gorbachev has already offered to cut down to350,000 and proposed equal ceilings of NATO and Warsaw Pact forcesof 1.35 million.   To reach 275,000, the Soviets would have to cut 350,000, orabout 57 percent.   Bush also challenged the Soviets to negotiate cutbacks in combataircraft as well as assault and attack helicopters so that the twoalliances have ceilings 15 percent below NATO's current level, orabout 5,440 for each side. This could result in a wrangle over thedefinition of Soviet planes, some of which Moscow describes asdefensive.   He also urged the Soviets to formalize a proposal by Gorbachevearlier this month for ceilings of 20,000 on tanks, 28,000 onarmored troop carries, and 16,500 to 24,000 for artillery pieces,depending on how the weapons are defined.   NATO and the Warsaw Pact opened negotiations in Vienna in Marchto reduce tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear arsenals acrossthe expanse of Europe -- from the Atlantic Ocean in the West to theUral Mountains in the Soviet Union in the East.   Gorbachev had set a target date of 1997. Bush, doing the Sovietleader one better, said the reductions should be implemented by1992 or 1993.   By contrast, 14 years of Vienna-based negotiations overreductions in Central Europe alone were abandoned last year with noresults.   On the economic front, Bush said the United States is nowwilling to cancel a blanket ban on transfers of high technology tothe Soviet Union. The sanction was imposed after the Red Armyinvaded Afghanistan in December 1979. The last Soviet troops werewithdrawn in February.</TEXT></DOC>
