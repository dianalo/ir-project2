 But I hope it will stimulate debate and get the Government totake up the concept in its own legislation.&quot;andM;Six months later, hacking still isn't top of the Government's prioritieslist.andP;  But despite such interia, a further Private Member's Bill on ComputerMisuse, piloted by MP Michael Colvin, has made it through its second readingin the Commons with all-party support.andM;Colvin's Bill, based on recommendations by the Law Commission, outlines threecategories of computer abuse offences: basic hacking -- defined asunauthorized access to computer systems -- punishable in magistrates court bya fine of up to 2,000 pounds or six months in jail; hacking with a view tocommitting crimes such as fraud or blackmail; and hacking to modify data ordamage a system, including erasing material and planting viruses, TrojanHorses and logic bombs.andM;The second and third categories are drafted to carry up to five years' jailand an unlimited fine.andM;Unlike Nicholson's Bill, Colvin's basic hacking law would not give police thepowers of search, arrest and seizure.andP;  Neither does the bill include finesfor electronic eavesdropping.andM;But Colvin claims it fills a big hole -- the UK is one of the few westernindustrial countries which has no computer crime laws to deal with thehacking menace, he says.andM;&quot;Computer misuse is costing UK industry an estimated 400 million pounds to 1billion pounds every year,&quot; Colvin said.andP;  If nothing is done the UK couldbecome some sort of international hackers' haven.&quot;andM;Colvin -- who believes it is imperative that society doesn't view the hackeras &quot;some sort of Raffles of the microchip&quot; -- fully recognises that his Billonly forms a framework in which to combat computer misuse.andM;&quot;It will not remove the need for companies to make sure that their owncomputer systems are adequately protected,&quot; he said.andM;Introducing his Bill, Colvin said he found that the paranoia hackers arecreating within industry is already blocking the free flow of datainformation.andM;&quot;Open systems need trust and hackers destroy trust,&quot; he said.andM;He also sees hacking as a legal timebomb.andP;  So far, out of 270 reportedhacking cases identified by the Department of Trade and Industry, only threehave been brought to trial.andP;  &quot;The problem is significant and growing, andlegislation to counter computer use is needed immediately,&quot; Colvin said.andM;In pledging government support for the bill, Douglas Hogg, Minister of Statefor Trade and Industry, echoed Colvin's fears.andP;  &quot;Those who have access, ortry to achieve access to air traffic control systems could well be puttinglives at risk,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;Those who achieve access to computer records in hospital which provide forthe delivery of drug dosages could have the same effect.&quot;andM;Hogg said that hacking legislation would close gaps in the law, especiallywithin the Malicious Damage Act which only covers damage to physicalproperty, not data stored in a computer.andM;Yet while Colvin's Bill is supported by a number of major computer companies,corporate customers and industry organizations -- including IBM, ICL, Bull,DEC, Ernst andamp; Young, Price Waterhouse, the National Computing Centre (NCC) andthe Computer Services Association -- there are some who believe it doesn't gofar enough.andP;  The bill runs the risk of being seen more as a public statementthan enforceable legislation.andM;Bob Hay, operations director of FAST (Federation Against Software Theft),said: &quot;Sections two and three on more serious offences are in principle fine,but clause one is unenforceable as it is virtually impossible to proveunauthorized trespass through guilty knowledge without the powers to searchand seize.&quot;andM;Hay, however, said he welcomed the idea of computer misuse legislation.andO;&quot;Certain aspects of current laws could be applied, but it would meanbastardizing them to legislate something they were not intended to do,especially in the light of the growing complexity of computer crime.&quot;andM;Speaking for the industry, David Carew-Jones, UK marketing manager of MetierManagement Systems, said he was very  disappointed with the Bill's drafting.andO;&quot;At the moment it has about as much bite as a toothless Rottweiler.&quot;andO;Carew-Jones said he hoped, &quot;more meaningful deterrents would be added atcommittee stage&quot;.andM;Hogg, however, warned against extending the Bill's powers at this stage.andO;Private members' legislation is a &quot;fragile vessel&quot;, he explained.andP;  He saidthat increasing police powers on basic hacking could arouse antagonism to thelaw.andM;Emma Nicholson, however, said that during the Bill's committee stage shewould be putting forward amendments to strengthen police powers oneavesdropping and the admissibility of computer evidence in court.andM;She cited anarchist magazine Insurrection's running of a step-by-step guideon how to access government, military and private computer systems, and theflooding of bulletin boards with pornography as proof of the need for morestringent legislation.andM;Loopholes there may be, but a large proportion of the industry is adamantthat the Bill is a step in the right direction.andM;&quot;It is undoubtedly a move forward,&quot; commented DEC's director of legalservices, John Boyd.andP;  &quot;Hacking is thought of as a sport in this country.andO;Even the introduction of a low level offence will help change publicopinion.&quot;andM;Barry Mason, a consultant for Ernst andamp; Young shared Boyd's commitment.andP;  &quot;It'snot perfect, but it gets us off the starting blocks and something on thestatute book.&quot;andM;If colvin's Bill doesn't get hacked to death at committee stage, it couldwell be on the statute books by the end of this summer.andM;But that is only the first hurdle.andP;  With the spread of wide area networks,and electronic data interchange in financial transactions, many expertsbelieve that international hacking legislation will be necessary.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
