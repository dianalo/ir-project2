An opposition leader said threepeople were killed.   Sheik Hasina, leader of the opposition Awami League, blamed theblasts on ``government intruders'' and said that ``police took awaythe three bodies.'' There was no immediate confirmation from thepolice.   After the explosions, helmeted riot police broke up crowds withtear gas shells and charged with bamboo staves.   At least 10 people were injured, three critically, includinglocal reporters and photographers, witnesses said.   The violence began shortly after Hasina and opposition leaderKhaleda Zia addressed separate rallies at the city's main square.   The women have led a series of strikes and demonstrations sinceNov. 10 to try to oust President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, theformer army general who took power in a bloodless coup in 1982.   Both women have pledged to boycott Thursday's parliamentaryelection and have called for a nationwide strike Wednesday andThursday to discourage voting. They contend that fair electionscannot be held while Ershad remains in power.   Ershad's Jatiya Party and several minor opposition parties haveput up candidates for the 300 elected seats of Parliament.   Ershad, who has vowed not to resign, has ordered army troopsdeployed to allow balloting to be held. Officials say 300,000soldiers and police will be on duty election day.   But a big turnout is not expected.   ``Honestly speaking, I do not even know the names of thecandidates for the Parliament from my constituency,'' said RafiqulIslam, a 45-year-old farmer in the village of Konnapara, 15 mileswest of Dhaka.   ``There is no campaigning by the candidates this time,'' hesaid. ``Even the people are not talking about it.''   More than 80 percent of Bangladesh's 105 million people live inrural areas. During recent visits to villages in the Savar districtand neighboring Manikganj, the only signs of politicking were strayposters showing the plow symbol of Ershad's Jatiya Party and thetorch used by a grouping of small opposition parties.   But a lack of interest doesn't mean the campaign has beenuneventful.   Three candidates have been shot to death. In cities like Dhaka,the capital, and Chittagong in the south, homemade bombs have beenthrown and other strong-arm tactics used to disrupt campaigning.   In addition, the anti-Ershad campaign has led to at least 25deaths and seriously damaged the already downtrodden economy ofBangladesh, among the world's poorest nations.   ``This election is not going to resolve the political andeconomic crisis confronting Bangladesh,'' said a senior Asiandiplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The election willonly accelerate the process of bloody confrontation.''   On Sunday, about 5,000 people attended the opposition rallies,which ended peacefully.   But then some protesters split away in groups of about 20 or 25and rampaged through the downtown area, hurling bricks at shops andpassing cars, witnesses said.   The protesters set fire to at least 12 vehicles, some of themcars and jeeps belonging to the government, they added.   Demonstrators also damaged and burned some makeshift camps setup by candidates for their campaign workers.   A number of homemade bombs were thrown near the city square, andblasts were also heard around the Dhaka University campus, a hotbedof anti-government protests.   The rioters were dispersed by about 300 policemen, who werestoned near the campus.   Hasina repeated her appeal to the military and civilianadministration to try to block ``the farcical polls'' called byErshad.   The military has been the driving force in Bangladesh'spolitics. In the country's 17-year history, every change ingovernment has been by coup. After he seized power in 1982, Ershad,58, was elected president in a 1986 vote that the oppositionboycotted and contends was rigged.</TEXT></DOC>
