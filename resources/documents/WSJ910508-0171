It was the first time since 1980 that consumer creditdropped for four consecutive months; the last four-monthdecline prior to that was during the 1958 recession.</LP><TEXT>   The continued decline is putting a damper on predictionsthat signs of increased consumer confidence following thePersian Gulf war would translate into increased consumerspending.   &quot;We already know they didn't start spending, and now weknow they are not borrowing, as well,&quot; said Robert Chandross,chief economist at Lloyds Bank PLC. &quot;This is one more reasonnot to have too much faith in consumer-confidence indexes.&quot;   February's decline was revised to a 0.3% annual rate, fromthe originally reported 3.7%.   Some economists targeted weak income levels, hesitantborrowing, a poor job market and unemployment as primaryreasons for continued decreases. Economists said the numbersalso suggest consumers are holding back on paying debts.   At least one analyst said the numbers represented tightlending practices by banks and other lenders, although otheranalysts said there was no clear indication of that.   Auto loans, not unlike auto sales figures, acceleratedtheir decline to a 9.7% annual rate, more than doubling therevised 4.7% rate in February.   Revolving credit, which includes credit cards, was theonly category to rise. It increased at a 17.6% annual rate,after climbing at a 10.8% rate in February.   At the end of March, consumer credit outstanding totaled$731.83 billion. All numbers are seasonally adjusted, and theFederal Reserve said they also reflect annual benchmarkrevisions.</TEXT></DOC>
