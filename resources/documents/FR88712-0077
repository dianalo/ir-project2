We have provided backgroundinformation about the proposed system in the ``Supplementary Information''section below. Although the Privacy Act requires only that the ``routineuses'' portion of the system be published for comment, HCFA invites commentson all portions of this notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>HCFA filed a new system report with the Speaker of theHouse, the President of the Senate and the Administrator, Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Executive Office of Management and Budget (EOMB),on July 1, 1988. The new system of records, including routine uses, willbecome effective September 12, 1988, unless HCFA receives comments whichwould warrant modification of the notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>The public should address comments to Richard A. DeMeo,HCFA Privacy Act Officer, Office of Management and Budget, Health CareFinancing Administration, Room G-M-1, East Low Rise, 6325 Security Boulevard,Baltimore, Maryland 21207.

This will allow HCFAto properly and expeditiously pay Medicare benefits to or on behalf ofthe beneficiary in question. Claims would be processed to this file priorto payment. This concept, at the least, provides work simplification forMedicare contractors. In addition, it is expected that several other benefitswill accrue, such as, enhancing the ability to apply uniform program safeguardsand providing for a quicker and more uniform response to changes in Medicarepolicy. This system also has a high potential for saving benefit dollars.The Privacy Act permits us to disclose information without consent of theindividual for ``routine uses''_that is, disclosure for purposes that arecompatible with the purpose for which we collect the information. We anticipatethat disclosure under the routine uses will not result in any unwarrantedadverse effects on personal privacy.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 30, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William L.
