GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prime Minister Herbert Blaize, whohailed the 1983 U.S.-led invasion of Grenada as a ``rescuemission'' that restored democracy and who won the election thatfollowed, died Tuesday after a long illness. He was 71.   Sir Paul Scoon, the British governor-general, named Deputy PrimeMinister Ben Jones to succeed Blaize until general elections areheld.   Scoon appealed for calm and asked the nation to lend the newprime minister their support. He noted that elections for a newgovernment will be held shortly, but set no date.   Grenada, the most southerly of the Windward Islands in theCaribbean, was due to hold general elections by March 1990, but thevote could be advanced.   Blaize suffered for years from prostate cancer and cripplingarthritis. He died at his official Mount Royal residence, Scoonannounced. No cause of death was stated.   Blaize walked with the aid of a cane and received regular cancertreatment at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington. He had becomeincreasingly frail and was unable to raise his voice above awhisper at a political luncheon this month.   He was elected prime minister on Dec. 3, 1984, in the firstelection after U.S. troops, supported by a small Caribbean force,invaded Grenada on Oct. 24-28, 1983, and ousted a Marxist militaryjunta that had seized power and assassinated Prime Minister MauriceBishop.   The invasion was widely criticized abroad as a breach ofGrenada's sovereignty, but Blaize said it saved Grenada from abrutal clique that placed the 100,000 residents under a 24-hourcurfew.   ``It was God who sent the Americans and Caribbean forces todeliver them (Grenadians),'' he said in an interview with TheAssociated Press in October 1988.   Scoon, Queen Elizabeth II's representative in the former Britishcolony, called the main opposition members of Parliament in fortalks Tuesday on forming a successor government.   Blaize had clung to power despite failing health, politicalbickering that cost him the party leadership, and a growing publicclamor over what many called his authoritarian style of leadership.   Herbert Augustus Blaize, born on Feb. 26, 1918, the son of alaborer, on the Grenadian offshore island of Carriacou, becameleader of the Grenada National Party in 1959, and headed thegovernment from 1962 to 1967.   Grenada became independent from Britain in 1974.   After the 1983 invasion, a coalition of centrist parties wascobbled together under the banner of the New National Party toprevent a possible election victory by Sir Eric Gairy, a populistwho was ousted as prime minister in a 1979 leftist coup.   Gairy's former administration had been riven by charges ofcorruption and repression.   Blaize, a Reagan administration favorite, was chosen to head thecoalition because of his previous government experience.   His popularity declined with the government's inability toimprove the economy and put a dent in Grenada's 20-percentunemployment rate.   Since the invasion, the United States has pumped more than $100million into Grenada, but a widely expected foreign investment boomnever materialized and U.S. aid dropped off.   Blaize is survived by his wife, Venetia, and their three sonsand three daughters.   A memorial service will be held Friday at St. George's AnglicanChurch, with funeral and burial Sunday in Carriacou.</TEXT></DOC>
