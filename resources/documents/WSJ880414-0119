The profit was partly due to higher sales of $2.35 billion, up 42% from $1.65 billion. Sales of the construction-equipment producer were boosted by the demand experienced by the whole industry as well as dealers who built up inventories, the company said. The company also cited more favorable pricing and foreign-currency translations as well as the absence of nonrecurring charges included in last year's results.    Industry analysts, while viewing the first quarter's $1.16-a-share profit positively, said they had expected net income to be somewhat higher. &quot;The quarter was good but not great,&quot; said Richard Rossi, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, New York. He had projected per-share net of $1.20 to $1.30 while some other analysts' estimates had run even higher. Heavy-equipment sector analysts, who often compare one quarter's results to the preceding quarter's, noted that although first-quarter sales were about 5% higher than the 1987 fourth quarter's, gross profit margins for both quarters were about the same.    &quot;That's exactly the problem,&quot; said Mitchell I. Quain, an analyst for Wertheim Schroder, New York. He blamed the flat margins on heavy overtime expenses, higher steel prices and the costs related to modernizing plant and equipment. And by building up dealer inventories in expectation of later retail sales, Caterpillar &quot;borrowed (sales) from the future without making the money they should've,&quot; he said. But pricing for Caterpillar products should continue to improve as the year progresses, further helping profitability, he added.    Caterpillar's stock closed at $65.25, down $1.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
