Even before the stock-market crash, analysts generally had been expecting a profit slowdown in the current quarter and in 1988, and the crash has reinforced their forecasts.    In the quarter ended Sept. 30, after-tax earnings on continuing operations of 526 major corporations rose 34% from a year earlier, a Wall Street Journal survey finds. Net income rose 33%, in contrast to a 21% drop in the second quarter and a 13% gain in the first quarter. The decline in the second period resulted mainly from big banks' huge additions to foreign-debt reserves.    The 33% rise in the latest quarter is the biggest gain for any three-month period since a 58% surge in the 1984 first quarter. It was spurred by a sharp speedup in economic activity, as inflation-adjusted gross national product rose at a rate of 3.8% a year after gaining at a 2.5% rate in the second quarter. The chief factors in that speedup were increases in consumer spending and business investment.    Before the 22.6% crash in stock prices Oct. 19, many analysts were expecting a recession to start in late 1988 or early 1989 and were looking for reduced profit growth as the economy slowed. The 51 economists interviewed early last month by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, forecast an average 8.3% gain in pretax profits next year, compared with a 10% rise they expected for 1987.    The group has yet to issue a post-crash report, but many analysts have scaled down their 1988 predictions. Robert J. Barbera of E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., New York, slashed his forecast of next year's gain to a range of 2% to 8% from 21%.    Most of the post-crash adjustments have been less drastic, however. Larry A. Kudlow of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., who had expected after-tax profits to rise 23% between the fourth quarter of this year and the 1988 fourth period, still expects a 10% gain. Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. says in an analysis, &quot;Profits of financial services firms, consumer products companies and retailers are likely to be most heavily hit.&quot;    Among industry groups showing strong earnings gains in the third quarter were auto makers, oil companies, building materials producers, chemical makers, forest products concerns and nonferrous metals companies. In addition, steelmakers, industrial and farm equipment makers and oil-field service companies swung into the black.    But the thrift and heavy construction groups posted third-quarter deficits, and profits were down for airlines, home builders, media and entertainment companies and railroads.    Here are third-quarter profits for various industry groups and comparisons with the year-earlier quarter. When individual companies report for three-month periods other than calendar quarters, the nearest comparable periods are used. In all the tables, 000s have been omitted.    AEROSPACE   Third-quarter profits continued depressed by write-downs to cover the costs of repairing faulty weapons systems and Pentagon reforms increasing contractors' shares of weapons costs. McDonnell Douglas says its military aircraft earnings were hurt by development costs of the Air Force's advanced tactical fighter prototype. In addition, its commercial-aircraft sector had a $7.7 million loss due to development costs on the MD-11 jumbo jetliner and problems with its medium-range MD-80. However, McDonnell Douglas's net income was helped by a pension-accounting change. At Northrop, analysts say, the secret Stealth bomber project was responsible for increasing sales 16%, but operating margins were depressed by problems in the project's development and with the MX missile project and the F-14 and F-16 jet fighters. Northrop also says its earnings were held down by investments in the advanced tactical fighter project. Boeing attributed its profit drop partly to &quot;cost and technical problems on several military-aircraft programs,&quot; which it wouldn't name. Lockheed took a $9 million charge to cover anticipated losses from discontinuance of its shipbuilding operations. &quot;The prospects for further painful adjustments is still pretty high,&quot; says Wolfgang Demisch, a First Boston Corp. analyst. He expects &quot;negative adjustments&quot; soon at McDonnell Douglas on the Apache helicopter, at Northrop on the air-launched cruise missile and at General Dynamics on the advanced cruise missile.                              3rd Qtr      3rd Qtr        %    14 Firms                   1987         1986        Chg    Boeing Co                104,000      157,000      - 34    Fairchild Inds               463        7,674      - 94    GenCorp                   17,000       38,000      - 55    General Dynamics         111,500      100,000      + 11    Grumman Corp               7,127       15,893      - 55    Lockheed Corp            101,000      115,000      - 12    Martin Marietta           55,625       53,218      +  5    McDonnell Doug            80,300       42,600      + 88    Northrop Corp             34,100     - 30,500       ...

Airlines that did better than in the 1986 thirdquarter benefited from recent mergers. Allegis, the parent ofUnited Airlines, says net dropped 25% from a year earlier,when it had a gain from the sale of two hotels. However,earnings more than doubled from continuing operations, whichincludes the airline operations being retained under arestructuring plan. AMR Corp., American's parent, was hurt bya 33% rise in fuel prices, start-up costs for three new hubsand a $19.5 million pretax charge for an early-retirementprogram. Delta was aided by its acquisition of Western AirLines last December. USAir's net, up 76% from a year earlier,included $14.7 million from its 55.5% equity share inPiedmont Aviation's earnings. Trans World's net declineddespite a $5.9 million tax credit; the carrier blamed lowerinvestment income, higher fuel prices and other increasedoperating expenses. However, operating income, whichincreased nearly 20% because of sharply improved passengertraffic, was the best of any quarter in TWA history. Eastern,reporting separately from its parent, Texas Air Corp., blamesa $67.4 million net loss on high fuel and labor costs, a workslowdown by pilots and increased competition from AmericanAirlines on the East Coast. NWA Inc., parent of NorthwestAirlines, says net was aided by gains from disposition ofassets, including gates and landing slots.                              3rd Qtr      3rd Qtr       %    11 Firms                   1987         1986        Chg    Allegis Corp              82,332      109,830     -  25    AMR Corp                  87,130      120,756     -  28    Delta Air Lines           59,106       53,021     +  11    NWA Inc                   87,336       59,729     +  46    Pan Am Corp               63,364        5,508     +1050    Piedmont Aviation         33,933       25,102     +  35    PS Group Inc               1,166        9,384     -  88    Southwest Airlines        20,432       21,181     -   4    Texas Air                -72,820      128,357       ...

GM lengthened the estimatedlives of its plants, equipment and special tools, slowing itsdepreciation and amortization charges. Without the changes,GM would have posted its third consecutive third-quarteroperating loss. Ford Motor's net income rose a scant 1%,partly because a pension-accounting change added $27 millionin the latest period. The July-September results were in facta sizable improvement, however, because earnings in the 1986third period included a one-time gain of $102 million fromasset sales. Vehicle sales fell at each of the Big Three froma year before, and analysts expect a further decline in thefourth quarter as the industry enters a cyclical downturnfollowing four years of strong sales. The big unknown iswhether the stock-market crash will smother consumerconfidence and exacerbate the already-expected slump.Nevertheless, analysts expect October-December profits to topthe year-earlier $1.49 billion, largely because of Ford'searnings strength and because GM took a big special chargefor restructurings and plant closings a year ago.                              3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr        %    14 Firms                   1987         1986        Chg    Champion Spk Plg           4,700     - 14,800       ...

Most of the earnings gains, however, stemmedfrom sources other than improved net interest income. Heavyreserving for Brazilian loans in the second quarter enabledbanks to shrink the sums that they set aside for loan lossesin the third quarter. In the third period, moreover, bankscould take advantage of the tax benefits associated with thesecond-quarter additions. Several banks, including Citicorp,Manufacturers Hanover and Chase Manhattan, realized gains onoverfunded pension plans. Others sold assets to liftearnings. Tighter control of non-interest expenses helpedprofits at BankAmerica, Chase and Manufacturers Hanover.However, banks' spreads between the interest rates they payand those they receive continued to shrink. Trading profits,which had buoyed earnings in previous quarters, weregenerally lower. And some banks, such as Citicorp and BankersTrust New York, continued to experience spiraling costs,caused partly by the weaker dollar's effect on expenses ofoverseas operations. Several banks, including FirstInterstate Bancorp. and Chemical New York, reported lossesdue to restructuring charges. Chemical announced a 10%reduction in its work force, and First Interstate said itwould sell several businesses.                              3rd Qtr      3rd Qtr       %    28 Firms                   1987         1986        Chg    Bank of Boston            74,000       62,300      + 19    Bank of New England       62,100       57,300      +  8    Bank of New York          45,201       37,893      + 19    BankAmerica               54,000      -23,000       ...

Marion Labs, for instance, gained mostly on theexplosive sales of its costlier heart drug, Cardizem. Net atMerck and Squibb rose because of several new drugs. All told,unit drug sales were flat compared with the year-earlierperiod, but prices increased about 9%, PrudentialBacheanalyst Neil Sweig says. He expects profit gains to moderatein the fourth quarter and next year but says a weakeningdollar would produce higher-than-expected growth. Syntexposted a sharp gain because of sales of its blockbusterarthritis drug, Naprosyn, and because of a year-earlier lossfrom discontiunued operations.

McCoy Jr., a KidderPeabody analyst. &quot;The outlook for the fourth quartercontinues to be quite strong.&quot; Many of the companies arehighly diversified, of course -- a factor making them lessvulnerable to a downturn in one particular segment. GeneralElectric says &quot;particularly good&quot; earnings growth came fromfinancial services, aircraft engines, plastics and medicalsystems. Zenith Electronics, an exception to the generaltrend, is highly dependent on consumer electronics. It blamedoperating losses on, among other things, volume and pricedeclines on video products. Its net loss was magnified by aprovision for severance pay for laid-off workers.

Many companiesreported record earnings, and some have issued optimisticprojections for the fourth quarter and 1988. But if the stockmarket's plunge sparks a recession, prices and profit marginscould tumble. And if interest rates should rise, lumberproducts, in which high volume has been helping offsetrecently softening prices, could be hurt. Westvaco's latestquarter included a $12.6 million gain from annuitization ofcertain liabilities, partially offset by higher expenses fornew-product development, a higher tax rate and a charge forclosing a facility. Mead posted a $42.8 million after-taxgain from sale of certain facilities; the year-earlierquarter was dented by a $15.7 million loss from discontinuedoperations. Earnings in the 1986 period at Scott Paper, BoiseCascade and Weyerhaeuser were damped by strikes.                              3rd Qtr      3rd Qtr       %    17 Firms                   1987         1986        Chg    Boise Cascade             50,390       13,240      +281    Champion Int'l            88,694       63,834      + 39    Federal Paper Board       21,124        9,920      +113    Fort Howard               45,421       42,506      +  7    Georgia-Pacific          118,000       97,000      + 22    Great Northern Nekoosa    55,700       34,600      + 61    Int'l Paper              102,000       91,000      + 12    James River Cp            47,312       46,237      +  2    Kimberly-Clark            84,100       63,000      + 33    Louisiana Pacific         42,600       22,200      + 92    Mead Corp                 97,400       25,300      +285    Potlatch Corp             22,604       16,737      + 35    Scott Paper               58,500       38,200      + 53    Union Camp                56,537       36,427      + 55    Westvaco Corp             43,162       25,938      + 66    Weyerhaeuser Co          126,123       62,247      +103    Willamette Inds           31,954       21,338      + 50    TOTAL                  1,091,621      709,724      + 54   GROCERY CHAINS   Earnings were mixed. Many companies enjoyed a lower taxrate, but soft markets and heavy price competition cut intoearnings in some regions. Circle K blamed its earnings dropon depressed economies in the energy states, pricing pressurein some areas and new convenience-store competition.Supermarkets General incurred $37 million in pretax expensesassociated with its plans to go private through a leveragedbuyout. Lucky had $4.3 million in income from discontinuedoperations; income from continuing operations surged 64% fromlast year. Southland posted $8.2 million in income fromdiscontinued operations; a year earlier, it had $6 million inincome from discontinued operations and an $84.2 million gainfrom sale of a half interest in Citgo. Kroger last year had$45.3 million in income from continuing operations before an$11.8 million loss from discontinued operations and an $82.3million special restructuring charge put it in the red.

Hospital operators also benefited froma slowing in the downward spiral of occupancy rates, butanalysts warn that occcupancy is still low. &quot;The environmentremains hostile and will continue to remain hostile as longas there's so much excess capacity,&quot; says Kenneth Abramowitz,of Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. Hospital Corp. of America had a$154 million after-tax gain from the sale of 104 hospitals,offset by a $73 million pretax increase in allowances fordoubtful accounts and a $126 million pretax write-down ofinvestments and properties. Humana posted a profit, against ayear-earlier net loss that reflected charges of $130.6million for expected losses on insurance contracts andplanned asset sales. American Medical International alsoposted a profit; its year-earlier net loss included a $65million pretax charge from closing its unprofitablegroup-health-insurance operation, $27 million in assetwrite-downs and $33 million in reserves for anticipatedMedicare cost disallowances. National Medical Enterprisesbenefited from the strong performance of its psychiatric andphysical-rehabilitation hospitals. A labor shortage andhigher labor costs have hurt some companies, particularlynursing-home operators. Profit of Beverly Enterprises, anursing-home concern, fell 82%. Baxter Travenol posted adecline, primarily because year-earlier net was bolstered byan $11 million profit from discontinued operations and a $285million gain on the sale of a drug unit, partly offset by a$58 million charge.                             3rd Qtr      3rd Qtr        %    7 Firms                    1987         1986        Chg    Amer Medical Intl         17,176      -65,320       ...

Fluor's results included a $5 millionloss from discontinued operations; last year's third quarterincluded a $27 million after-tax gain from the sale of itsIrvine, Calif., complex. Morrison-Knudsen had a plethora ofone-time items amounting to a net charge of $76 million. Thecompany says its restructuring will allow it to concentrateon a near-record contract backlog of $3.8 billion at Sept.30. Blount's earnings fell largely because of a $4.3 millioncharge for construction-related expenses. Dravo reported a$15 million write-off on engineering and constructioncontracts; its year-earlier profits included a $27.5 milliongain from a contract-default award. Analysts say theindustry's restructuring, while recently hurting profits,would provide a lift in the future. Leone Young, of DrexelBurnham Lambert, says she expects many of the companies tomove into the black during the fourth quarter or early 1988.But Wayne Johnson, of H.G.

HOME BUILDERS   Rising mortgage-interest rates began to take a toll onhome builders, but demand remained strong in some regions,particularly California and Florida. An increase in move-upbuyers and average prices 15% higher than last year liftedearnings at Los Angeles-based Kaufman andamp; Broad Home despite aslight decline in sales. Ryland Group's acquisition late lastyear of M.J. Brock, a California home builder, helped theColumbia, Md., builder overcome a sales slump in itsMid-Atlantic and West regions. Houston's U.S. Home says itshome-building revenues stayed about even with a year earlieras higher prices offset weaker sales. But rising interestrates, delinquencies and foreclosures led to a loss in itsmortgage unit. In addition, the builder set aside another $2million for possible foreclosure expenses and $2.5 millionfor possible losses from its discontinued manufactured-homesbusiness. It also had $2.1 million in legal expenses insettling lawsuits and a $3.6 million charge from the reversalof tax-loss carry-forwards. Sales of Pulte Home fell 19%,largely because of soft markets in Texas and Colorado.                             3rd Qtr      3rd Qtr        %    5 Firms                    1987         1986        Chg    Centex                     7,676       14,080      - 45    Kaufmanandamp;BroadHm            8,775        5,521      + 59    Pulte Home                 3,794        7,911      - 52    Ryland Group              11,550       11,068      +  4    U S Home                 - 3,587        5,519       ...

Caterpillar's return to black ink resultedmostly from a 23% surge in volume. In addition, a strike inthe 1986 quarter at its Joliet, Ill., plant and a one-timepayment to employees hurt year-earlier results. AMInternational's fiscal fourth quarter included an $8.5million gain from a tax-loss carry-forward, compared with ayear-earlier $4.1 million gain from a tax-loss carry-forwardand a credit related to the company's reorganizationproceedings. Colt's profit rise was partly due to a $25.7million gain from the sale of its British affiliate; however,because of a recapitalization last year, Colt's interestexpense jumped to $41.9 million from $5.4 million a yearearlier. The industry's &quot;fourth-quarter outlook is dynamite,&quot;says Mitchell Quain, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co.&quot;The good news for industrial America is that the twonegatives that prevented these companies from seeing anyupturn in the past four years -- the strong dollar and thedecline in energy markets -- are both reversing.&quot; He addsthat the companies are in a good position to weather anydownturn in the economy because they have already slashedcosts.                             3rd Qtr       3rd Qtr       %    12 Firms                   1987         1986        Chg    AM International           9,834      -11,985       ...

Commercial-insurance rates aredeclining from cyclical peaks, but the lagging reflection onthe bottom line means earnings are likely to continue stronginto next year. Meanwhile, companies such as Travelers andLincoln National posted losses in group health insurancebecause of higher-than-expected claims and costs of offeringhealth-maintenance organizations. Myron Picoult, an analystat Oppenheimer andamp; Co., says insurers' revenues and earningswere slightly below expectations. The health-insuranceresults and some catastrophe losses hurt earnings, he says,adding that disappointing revenues could be a positive signthat insurers aren't slashing commercial-insurance prices toattract new business. At Aetna, Cigna and Continental,operating income rose, but smaller capital gains and taxbenefits depressed net.

Lower tax rates should continue toaid media earnings, but analysts say the fourth quarter couldbe affected by any economic slowdown resulting from the stockmarket's plunge.                             3rd Qtr      3rd Qtr        %    19 Firms                   1987         1986        Chg    Cap Cities-ABC            38,436       18,370      +109    CBS Inc                   59,900       28,600      +109    Chris-Craft Inds             747        4,198      - 82    Dow Jones andamp; Co            36,839       33,098      + 11    Dun andamp; Bradstreet         104,309       89,113      + 17    Gannett Co                70,519       65,530      +  8    Grolier Inc                3,440        1,895      + 82    Harcourt Brace J          75,506       58,147      + 30    Knight-Ridder             33,449       31,480      +  6    MacMillan Inc             43,315       32,925      + 32    MCA Inc                   46,847       74,508      - 37    McGraw-Hill               52,400       47,104      + 11    Meredith Corp             11,132        9,423      + 18    N Y Times Co              32,597       26,674      + 22    Time Inc                  74,000      252,000      - 71    Times Mirror Co           70,600       73,975      -  5    Tribune Co                33,085      123,450      - 73    Warner Commun             66,212       41,752      + 59    Washington Post Co        61,313       21,131      +190    TOTAL                    914,646    1,033,373      - 11   NONFERROUS METALS   Aluminum earnings were strong. A furious climb in ingotprices, which began earlier this year, pulled up prices forfabricated products. In addition, KaiserTech's profitincluded a $16.1 million net gain from the sale of afood-service foil and foil-container business, partiallyoffset by a $13 million charge to reflect the restructuringof corporate staff. The outlook for aluminum through thefourth quarter and 1988 first half remains strong, thoughsome observers worry that an oversupply of ingot -- which haddragged down earnings before this year's rebound -- couldbecome a problem again. At most mining companies,third-quarter earnings were lifted by sharply higher metalsprices, several years of deep cost cutting and cutbacks insupply while demand has remained constant. Moreover, assetsales helped Asarco and Amax. Asarco says nonrecurring gainsfrom selling investments accounted for $222.2 million of itspretax earnings, and Amax reported one-time gains of $132million during the third quarter.                             3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr         %    11 Firms                   1987        1986         Chg    Aluminum Co Am           109,100      34,100      + 220    AMAX                     176,200       2,600      +6677    ASARCO Inc               227,480      17,634      +1190    Callahan Mining              558         990      -  44    Eagle-Picher Inds          9,033       9,363      -   4    Hanna M A Co              10,025       2,732      + 267    Hecla Mining               9,612     - 1,991        ...

Apple Computer's profit morethan doubled on the strength of its popular Macintosh PCline, and Compaq Computer's net more than quadrupled. NCRChairman Charles E. Exley Jr. said PC orders nearly doubledin the period, the first quarter in which the company earneda profit on PCs. However, some companies, though postingstrong earnings gains, didn't meet Wall Street'sexpectations. International Business Machines reported strongsales of its new PC line, but Big Blue's 12% earnings gainfell short of forecasts. IBM's profit included an undisclosedone-time charge related to a retirement plan in West Germanyas well as benefiting by $80 million from the sale of a stakein Intel, a lower tax rate and currency translations.Hewlett-Packard, which posted a 20% earnings gain,disappointed Wall Street by reporting flat quarter-to-quarterrevenue. Aided by a $45.4 million gain on the sale ofstockholdings, Control Data reported a profit, against ayear-earlier loss. Industry analysts are watching to see howthe stock-market slump will affect computer makers. Becausemost users have already made purchase decisions, high-techcompanies should escape problems in the fourth quarter. Ifcustomers do cut back capital spending, the first signs oftrouble could occur early next year.                              3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr       %    19 Firms                   1987        1986        Chg    Amdahl Corp               36,784       7,111      +417    Apple Computer            71,678      32,893      +118    Compaq Computer           36,438       8,705      +319    Control Data               6,800    -  9,300       ...

Continued improvement is expected throughoutthe industry in the fourth quarter and in 1988 as companiesbenefit from cost-cutting programs. Schlumberger's oil-fieldservices business boosted income from continuing operationsto $83 million from break-even levels a year earlier. Its netincome included a $220 million loss on the sale of itsFairchild Semiconductor unit and $139 million in gains.Halliburton's sales and operating income from its oil-fieldservices and products units increased from depressedyear-earlier levels.

PETROLEUM   Oil prices were higher than in the 1986 third quarter,boosting earnings for many oil companies focused on thenow-profitable exploration and production sectors. Alsoturning in sterling performances were most companies'chemical operations. However, sharply lower profits fromrefining and marketing eroded those gains, especially for themajor integrated concerns. One notable exception was Amoco,where relatively large exploration and production operationshelped it chalk up a huge gain. Without a $150 million losson the sale of the Container Corp. business during lastyear's third quarter, Mobil's third-quarter earnings thisyear would have slipped 4% rather than rising 75%. Thecombination of higher crude costs and more competitiveproduct prices will last through year end, and suchintegrated giants as Exxon, Mobil and Chevron could reportlower full-year earnings, says Barry Good, a Morgan Stanley andamp;Co. analyst.                              3rd Qtr    3rd Qtr        %    22 Firms                   1987        1986        Chg    Amerada Hess              38,570      41,853     -   8    American Petrofina        21,167       5,663     + 274    Amoco Corp               412,000      13,000     +3069    Ashland Oil Inc           65,530      34,317     +  91    Atlantic Richfield       315,000     102,000     + 209    Chevron Corp             245,000     208,000     +  18    Crown Central P       -    3,088       1,757       ...

RobertBuchanan of L.F. Rothschild predicts an average gain of 10%to 12% in third-quarter net from continuing operations, downfrom a 26% average first-half increase for the 17 retailershe follows. Moreover, much of the third-quarter increase willresult from lower tax rates. &quot;Without tax reductions, somecompanies would not have any gains at all,&quot; says MonroeGreenstein of Bear Stearns. Results are likely to be mixed.Dayton Hudson says it expects to report earnings&quot;substantially below&quot; last year's because of heavy markdownsat its ailing Mervyn's chain and its Dayton Hudsondepartment-store unit. But sharp gains are likely at J.C.Penney, which has changed its merchandise mix to include morehigher-margin goods such as apparel, Wal-Mart Stores and Toys&quot;R&quot; Us.

But a few othersfound a &quot;difficult operating climate,&quot; as Merrill LynchChairman William A. Schreyer described the quarter. Without a$100.3 million after-tax gain from a real-estate transaction,Merrill's net would have been flat. Earnings at AmericanExpress dropped, mainly because it booked a $33 million lossfrom its Fireman's Fund unit. Morgan Stanley Group'sinvestment-banking revenue increased 62%, and E.F. Hutton'srevenue for continuing operations rose 47%, with gains inasset management fees, investment banking and interestincome. But earnings plunged at Salomon Inc., one of a numberof securities firms closing or shrinking municipal-bondoperations. PaineWebber's investment-banking business andmutual-fund sales declined, and its net fell 30%. Thestock-market crash makes predicting the firms' fourth quartertough, says James P.

Higher prices, spurred byinventory-building and production problems, kept theindustry's yearlong rebound alive, but one-time gainscontinued to prop up some big companies. Bethlehem earnedonly $900,000 after deducting unusual items, including a biginvestment tax rebate. Inland was hurt by productionconstraints and fixed contracts at lower prices, and its netincome included $3.2 million in tax-loss carry-forwards. LTVand Wheeling-Pittsburgh continued to reap major pension andinterest savings from their bankruptcy-court reorganizations,and both companies' profits were boosted by tax-losscarry-forwards. Without the credits, Wheeling-Pittsburghearned $15.2 million, and LTV $72.7 million. Armco earned $15million before extraordinary items, against a year-earlierloss that included $27 million in charges. In the thirdquarter, nevertheless, the industry had sharply improvedconditions. USX, the nation's No. 1 steelmaker, recorded anoperating profit of $32 for each ton shipped, minus one-timeitems, compared with $6 in the strike-marred second quarter.Analysts continue to scale back fourth-quarter earningsestimates. The companies &quot;are failing to take advantage ofbetter conditions, and pretty soon we will be moving into anuncertain 1988,&quot; Robert A. Hageman of Kidder Peabody says.But steelmakers expect black ink through the fourth quarter,even if customers start cutting inventories in anticipationof an economic downturn.                             3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr        %    10 Firms                   1987        1986        Chg    Armco Inc                 25,800  -   59,000       ...

Some companies say they expect bothfactors to weaken fourth-quarter profits, too. High cottonprices put margins under pressure at some textile concerns,such as West Point-Pepperell. The company says strong profitgains in apparel fabrics and finished apparel contributed toits 17% profit gain in the Sept. 30 quarter.Fieldcrest-Cannon says its net, down 82%, was hurt by highstart-up costs for stain-resistant carpeting and by a $10million charge related to higher materials costs. However, arecent downturn in cotton prices, if sustained, should lift1988 profit, Chairman Joseph B. Ely II says. Analysts say thecostly manufacturing problems with the new carpeting aretemporary and should be cleared up by the first quarter.Springs Industries says improved earnings in home furnishingand finished fabrics sparked its 134% profit increase.

Meritortook charges totaling $377 million to write down good willresulting from a 1982 acquisition, boost loan-loss reservesand restructure its balance sheet. Gibraltar had $239 millionof charges to cover expected losses on real estate and raiseloan-loss reserves. Financial Corp. added $70.4 million toits loan-loss reserves and couldn't repeat the big gains fromsales of mortgage-backed securities that increasedyear-earlier profit. Other thrifts were hurt by thinnerspreads between loan yields and deposit costs, as yields rosemore slowly. Also reducing net at several thrifts were highertax rates under the new tax law and lower gains from sales ofloans and mortgage-backed securities. The outlook for thefourth quarter isn't any brighter. &quot;I expect earnings to bedown from the third quarter and down from a year ago,&quot; AllanG. Bortel, a Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst says. &quot;The costof funds has risen, and the yield on loans has fallenslightly.

Firestone Tire andamp;Rubber was helped by a $10 million tax credit in the latestquarter; in the 1986 third period, it had a $6 millionafter-tax gain from partial liquidation of inventories. Thecompanies expect improved results in the current quarter as aresult of strong sales of replacement tires, especiallyhigh-performance tires. They also will be aided byrestructuring and cost-reduction programs and a lower dollar,which makes imports more expensive.                              3rd Qtr     3rd Qtr        %   3 Firms                     1987       1986         Chg    Firestone Tire andamp; R        46,000      27,000      + 70    Goodyear Tire andamp; R        178,700     182,300      -  2    Rubbermaid Inc            24,300      19,600      + 24    TOTAL                    249,000     228,900      +  9   TOBACCO   &quot;Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco live in a financialfairyland,&quot; says Emmanuel Goldman, a Montgomery Securitiesanalyst.
