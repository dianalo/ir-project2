As the computation is essentially thesame as the one leading to the index of the Dirac-Ramond operator, theyare determined by the gauge and gravitational anomaly structure of thetheory. Specifically, we calculate the four-point effective action inten dimensions, the corrections to the kinetic terms in d=6 (includingauxiliary fields) and the Fayet-Iliopoulos D-term in d=4. We also computethe {beta}-function of four-dimensional N=2 theories from the ellipticgenus in d=6. Furthermore, we derive supersymmetry Ward type identitiesin terms of Kac-Moody characters, relating parity conserving with parityviolating amplitudes.</TEXT></DOC>
