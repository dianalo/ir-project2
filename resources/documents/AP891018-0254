PRASSO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Los Angeles financier Marvin Davis has withdrawnhis backup $300-a-share, all-cash bid for United Airlines' parentbut indicated he might make another offer.   ``We remain very interested in acquiring UAL Corp.,'' Davis saidin a statement late Tuesday.   A proposed $300-a-share offer by a pilot-management group, alongwith British Airways PLC, fell short Friday when banks refused tofinance the deal. News of the financing problems helped trigger thelargest drop in the Dow Jones industrials average since the crashof 1987, but the group and its lenders are attempting to work out arevised proposal.   At the time, Davis said his offer would apply if thepilot-management deal fell through. It was Davis who had triggeredthe UAL buyout battle when he first submitted a bid for the companyin August.   But Davis said that when the bank financing fell through for thepilot-management group, his agent bank informed him that it wasexploring the level of financing available for his proposedacquisition of UAL.   Davis said he intended to continue working with his financingsources ``in order to determine at what price a bid can befinanced.''   On Tuesday, UAL stock plunged as investors continued to expressskepticism over efforts by the pilot-management group to puttogether a new buyout proposal. Shares fell $24.87{ to close at$198 in New York Stock Exchange trading, after plummeting nearly$57 a share on Monday.   ``There's still a significant group on Wall Street that simplydoes not believe a deal is going to get done for UAL,'' saidStephen Dexter, an airline industry analyst with Kemper FinancialServices Inc.   Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank were working to line upJapanese lenders to finance the deal.   Terms of the revised UAL proposal would lower the bid to $250 ashare or $5.62 billion, raise the interest rate on the loan andgive banks bigger fees for participating, said Akira Yokoo, aCiticorp spokesman in Tokyo.   The Evening Standard in London reported that Dai-ichi KangyoBank had agreed to participate in the deal, partly because theJapanese government wanted to boost the country's reputation as anaggressive lender.   At Mitsubishi Trust Bank in Tokyo, a spokesman said the bankwould ``probably'' finance part of the deal.   Meanwhile, John Peterpaul, the vice president of theInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,reiterated the union's vehement opposition to the takeover andcalled for the resignation of UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf.   ``Your role in the recent effort to take over United Airlines... can only be characterized as greedy and irresponsible,''Peterpaul said in a letter to Wolf.   Wolf would have reaped $76.7 million and chief financial officerJohn C. Pope, $37.7 million under the original buyout proposal.   Wolf said any resignations were not in the best interest of thecompany. He defended his actions and those of the board ofdirectors, saying it was ``regrettable'' and ``totally unfair''that the Machinists have ``chosen to make such a divisive anduncalled-for statement.''   Kemper analyst Dexter said the demand for Wolf's resignationreinforces bankers' concerns that without the support of theMachinists, the nation's second-largest air carrier is likely to bemore financially unstable after a buyout.   ``The Machinists are trying to get a 5 percent raise and thepresident is reaping $70 million,'' he said. ``You can understandwhy they're hostile.''</TEXT></DOC>
