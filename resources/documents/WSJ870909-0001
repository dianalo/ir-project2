Officials involved in the negotiations said a public announcement of the transaction is likely to be made this week, and possibly as early as today. A billion-dollar rescue of the troubled Houston-based bank holding company would be the second-largest government bailout of a bank after the 1984 rescue of Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co. of Chicago.    The large scale of the assistance package reflects the continuing deterioration of what was once Houston's leading banking firm, but which has suffered for years from growing losses from its aggressive energy and real estate lending operations. First City, with 62 Texas banks and $12.2 billion in assets at June 30, has been casting about for outside help since it announced earlier this year that it wasn't likely to work out its problems by itself.    The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the comptroller of the currency have been involved in intensive negotiations over the past several weeks with First City bidders, all of whom believed that the bank's substantial problems merited sizable FDIC assistance.    Among the bidders, as previously reported, are A. Robert Abboud, former chairman of First Chicago Corp.; MCorp, a Dallas bank holding company that itself is deeply troubled; and a Chicago businessman. At various times, Citicorp and the Bank of Scotland, which has several lending offices in the U.S., each separately considered a federally assisted purchase of First City, but their deliberations with the FDIC didn't advance to the final stages.    According to bidders competing with Mr. Abboud, it appears that the former Chicago banking executive may win the FDIC's nod to take over First City. Last night, Mr. Abboud was in Houston but he couldn't be reached.    A First City spokesman also wasn't available for comment last night. In the past, First City has declined to comment on the FDIC's negotiations with potential bidders.    An FDIC official said major elements of the First City rescue package wouldn't differ much from bank rescue measures of the past. Those measures have involved an injection of FDIC funds together with capital raised by private investors. Also, the FDIC usually takes over all or a portion of the bank's worst loans, or guarantees a maximum loss investors might sustain from the sour loans. And existing common stockholders of the banking company are likely to suffer substantial losses in the value of their shares. Existing top management is usually required to step down. </TEXT></DOC>
