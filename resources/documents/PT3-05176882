A first fiber optic sensor cell is used for      measuring any combination of ionic species and a second fiber optic sensor      cell is used for measuring all gaseous species. In one embodiment, a doped      polymer is formed utilizing a hydrophilic polymer which immobilizes a pH      sensitive dye and a potassium sensitive fluorescence dye, allowing pH to      be measured by detecting the color change of the pH sensitive dye, and the      potassium ion concentration to be measured by the change in fluorescence      intensity of the potassium sensitive dye. In an alternative embodiment, a      doped polymer is formed utilizing a hydrophilic polymer which immobilizes      a calcium or sodium ion sensitive fluorescence dye in order to form either      a combined pH/calcium sensor or a combined pH/sodium sensor, respectively.      Any desired fluorescence dye can be utilized in order to provide detection      of a desired analyte or any combination of analytes in conjunction with a      pH measurement. A gas sensor is provided utilizing a doped polymer which      immobilizes a fluorescence dye sensitive to the gas of interest. In one      embodiment, an oxygen sensitive fluorescent dye allows measurement of the      partial pressure of oxygen utilizing fluorescence quenching of the oxygen      sensitive dye. The concentration of other gases such as nitrous oxide,      carbon dioxide, and halogenated anesthetic gases, are measured utilizing      infrared absorption within the doped polymer. Each such gas is      individually detected utilizing its associated characteristic absorption      wavelength. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention pertains to in vivo physiological sensors, and more      particularly in vivo physiological sensors utilizing optical fibers and      capable of measuring a plurality of serum analytes. </PAR><PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART </PAC><PAR>  It is well known in the prior art to measure certain parameters in a blood      stream, such as pH and concentrations of O.sub.2, CO.sub.2, Naandplus;, and Kandplus;.      When monitoring a patient, it is necessary to make frequent determinations      of these analytes, and thus determinations of these analytes is often made      in vivo. </PAR><PAR>  It is known in the prior art to utilize a plurality of sensors, one for      each analyte such that the sensor is placed in a patient's blood stream      and electrical signals detected which are indicative of the relative      concentration of the analyte being measured. However, if it is desired to      measure a plurality of analytes, the use of a plurality of sensors is      required, with the attendant discomfort to the patient and complexity of      the electronic monitoring apparatus. </PAR><PAR>  European patent application 0 253 559 A1 describes an apparatus and method      for making in vivo measurements of CO.sub.2 concentration in a patient's      blood stream. This structure utilizes an optical fiber which transmits an      infrared signal to the distal end of the optical fiber, whereupon it is      reflected. The optical fiber is permeable to CO.sub.2, and thus the      intensity of the return signal is diminished in proportion to the      concentration of the CO.sub.2 in the optical fiber. Thus, the change in      intensity of the infrared light is indicative of the CO.sub.2      concentration in the patient's blood. </PAR><PAR>  &quot;Optical Fluorescence and Its Application to an Intravascular Blood Gas      Monitoring System,&quot; Gehrich et al., IEEE Transactions on Biomedical      Engineering, Volume BME-33, NO. 2, February 1986, pages 117-132, describes      the use of optical fluorescence to measure pH, PCO.sub.2, and PO.sub.2      utilizing appropriate dyes. A single intravascular blood gas probe      includes three optical fibers terminating in a pH, PCO.sub.2, and PO.sub.2      sensor, respectively. Each fluorescent dye emits energy at a wavelength      different from that at which it absorbs the excitation energy, allowing a      single optical fiber to both deliver excitation energy to the dye and      receive energy emitted by the dye. By detecting the amount of emitted      energy, the absorbed energy is determined, which in turn is related to the      analyte being measured. </PAR><PAR>  The greatest difficulty in designing in vivo physiological sensors,      including those utilizing optical fibers, is the limitation on physical      dimension. On the one hand, the diameter of the individual optical fibers      must be sufficiently large to allow the transmission of sufficient optical      signal to permit accurate measurements to be made. On the other hand, the      total diameter of the physiological sensor must be sufficiently small to      minimize the opening in the patient at the measurement site in order to      avoid adding risk to the patient being monitored, as well as to minimize      the discomfort of the patient. Due to these limitations, there is a limit      to the number of analytes which can be monitored simultaneously by a      single physiological sensor since, as taught by the prior art, a      physiological sensor must include one optical fiber for each analyte to be      measured. </PAR><PAR>  There remains the need, therefore, to provide a physiological sensor      capable of measuring a plurality of analytes substantially simultaneously      and yet which is small in size. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In accordance with the teachings of this invention, a physiological sensor      is provided in which an optical fiber is used in conjunction with a sensor      capable of sensing more than one analyte. In one embodiment to this      invention, a first fiber optic sensor cell is used for measuring any      combination of ionic species and a second fiber optic sensor cell is used      for measuring all gaseous species. In this manner, the number of analytes      which may be monitored utilizing a single sensor is increased as compared      with the prior art. </PAR><PAR>  In one embodiment of this invention, a doped polymer is formed utilizing a      hydrophilic polymer which immobilizes a pH sensitive dye and a potassium      sensitive fluorescence dye, allowing pH to be measured by detecting the      color change of the pH sensitive dye, and the potassium ion concentration      to be measured by the change in fluorescence intensity of the potassium      sensitive dye. </PAR><PAR>  In an alternative embodiment, a doped polymer is formed utilizing a      hydrophilic polymer which immobilizes a calcium or sodium ion sensitive      fluorescence dye in order to form either a combined pH/calcium sensor or a      combined pH/sodium sensor, respectively.

As shown in FIG. 1, physiological sensor 100 includes a first fiber optic      sensor cell 101a for measuring any combination of ionic species and a      second fiber optic sensor cell 101b for measuring all gaseous species. By      utilizing one sensor to measure ionic species, and another fiber optic      sensor for measuring gaseous species, the number of analytes which may be      monitored utilizing a single sensor is greatly increased as compared with      the prior art, while providing a physiological sensor of small diameter      since only two optical fibers are necessary. </PAR><PAR>  Ionic sensor cell 101a includes optical fiber 102a whose proximal end (not      shown) is connected to a suitable source of excitation energy and suitable      detection apparatus, as is described in more detail later. An ion      permeable membrane 113 serves to house optical fiber 102a, reflector 105a,      and polymer 114. Energy transmitted from the source (not shown) is      communicated via optical fiber 102a through doped polymer 114, to the face      of reflector 105a. The energy is then reflected by reflector 105a back      through doped polymer 114 to optical fiber 102a for the return trip to the      optical sensor mechanism. Reflector 105a may conveniently be formed      utilizing stainless steel or the like. Doped polymer 114 comprises a      hydrophilic polymer which immobilizes a pH sensitive dye and a potassium      sensitive dye. In one embodiment, for example, the hydrophilic polymer      comprises polyacrylamide or polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate, the pH      sensitive dye comprises phenol red. pH is measured by detecting the color      change of the pH sensitive dye, in a well known manner. Potassium ion      concentration is measured by the change in fluorescence intensity of the      potassium sensitive dye due to its interaction with the chelating reagent      (such as crown ether, valinomycin, or the like) attached to the dye. </PAR><PAR>  Of importance, measurement of both pH and potassium concentration are made      utilizing a single optical fiber 102a since each such measurement requires      the detection of a different part of the visible light spectrum Thus,      optical fiber 102a receives two different excitation wavelengths by      alternating the selection of light sources coupled to optical fiber 102a,      and detector means serves to detect two different corresponding emission      wavelengths. </PAR><PAR>  In an alternative embodiment, doped polymer 114 includes calcium or sodium      ion sensitive fluorescence dye which is used in a similar manner to form      fiber optic sensor 101a as either a combined pH/calcium sensor or a      combined pH/sodium sensor, respectively. In a similar fashion, doped      polymer 114 can include any desired fluorescence dye in order to enable      fiber optic sensor 101a to measure any desired serum electrolyte in      combination with pH measurement. For example, the following table      specifies possible fluorescent chromophores for sensing various types of      ions. </PAR><TBL>  ______________________________________                                         FLUORESCENT CHROMOPHORES FOR ION SENSING                                                            Excitation Emission                                                            Wavelength Wavelength                                     Ion   Chromophore    (nm)       (nm)                                           ______________________________________                                         K.sup.andplus;                                                                              N-(9,Anthryl-  366-370    412-416                                              methyl)Monoaza-                                                                18-crown-6                                                               K.sup.andplus;                                                                              Coumaro Cryptand                                                                              330        340-500                                              of Kryptofix 222                                                         Na.sup.andplus;                                                                             Coumaro Cryptand                                                                              330        340-500                                              of Kryptofix 221                                                         Li.sup.andplus;                                                                             Coumaro Cryptand                                                                              330        340-500                                              of Kryptofix 211                                                               in the presence                                                                of Kryptofix 221                                                         H.sup.andplus;                                                                              Hydroxipyrene  460        520                                                  trisulfonic acid                                                         ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAR>  Ion permeable membrane 113 comprises, for example, cuprophan and serves to      allow the ions of interest to travel between the fluid being measured and      doped polymer 114. </PAR><PAR>  Also shown in FIG. 1 as part of physiological sensor 100 is gas sensor      101b.

Of importance, each such gas is individually detected      since each gas has associated therewith its own characteristic absorption      wavelength which can be individually measured. If desired, multiple      absorption wavelengths may be utilized to determine the concentration of a      single or multiple gases using multi variant analysis, such as singular      value decomposition (SVD) or similar techniques.

System 200 includes      physiological sensor 100 and optical fibers 102a and 102b of FIG. 1. In      the embodiment of FIG. 2, the ion sensor uses a potassium specific      fluorescent dye which absorbs at 330 nm and emits at 410 nm. The pH is      measured by the absorption of phenol red at 547 nm. The ion sensor is      referenced utilizing a red LED emitting at 650 nm in order to provide a      reference measurement to determine losses due to optical fiber bending,      connectors, etc. </PAR><PAR>  In this embodiment, LED 202-1 is a red/green LED which is coupled to an      optical fiber. Red/green light in the fiber is then mode scrambled by mode      scrambler 241 to reduce differences in the reference and signal arms. The      output signal from mode scrambler 241 is then coupled by Y-piece      multiplexor 208, and in turn is input to wavelength division multiplexor      203. Laser 202-2 comprises an N.sub.2 laser providing uv energy at      approximately 337 nm to wavelength division multiplexor 203. Wavelength      division multiplexor 203 thus provides red/green/uv light to optical fiber      102a which travels to the ion sensor portion of physiological sensor 100.      There, the uv light excites fluorescence in the potassium specific dye, a      portion of the green light is absorbed by the phenol red, and the red      light is merely reflected. </PAR><PAR>  The fluorescence light and the reflected green and red light travel back      through optical fiber 102a to wavelength division multiplexor 203, where      they are split into short and long wavelength components, with a split      occurring at approximately 500 nm. The short wavelength blue light which      was produced by fluorescence from the potassium specific dye is coupled to      silicon photodiode 204-2 for detection, from which the potassium      concentration is derived. The long wavelength light is coupled back      through Y-piece multiplexor 208 into silicon photodiode 204-1. The red and      green portions of red/green LED 202-1 are time division multiplexed in      order to alternately provide red and green reflected light to silicon      photodiode 204-1 so that red and green light are detected individually.      The reflected red light is used for calibration purposes to account for      losses in the system due to connectors, bends, and the like. The detection      of the green light provides an indication of the potassium content of the      fluid being measured by physiological sensor 100. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment of FIG. 2, the gas sensor portion of physiological      detector 100 utilizes an oxygen sensitive fluorescent dye which absorbs at      470 nm and emits at 620 nm. The carbon dioxide concentration of the fluid      being measured by physiological sensor 100 is determined by absorption at      2 microns. In one embodiment, the fluorescent sensor uses a phase      dependent technique as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,716,363 on an      invention entitled &quot;Exponential Decay of Time Constant Measurement Using      Frequency of Offset Phase-locked Loop: System and Method&quot; which is      assigned to Hewlett-Packard Company, the assignee of this application.      This technique precludes the need for the use of a reference wavelength      such as the red light used in the ion sensor portion of this embodiment.      The carbon dioxide measurement is referenced from the zero absorption      level located adjacent to the CO.sub.2 peak at 2 microns. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 2, LED 212-1 provides light at 470 nm and LED 212-2      provides light at 2 microns. This light from LEDs 212-1 and 212-2 are      combined in fused taper coupler 218 and then applied to wavelength      division multiplexor 213. This light is coupled by wavelength division      multiplexor 213 to optical fiber 102b. A portion of the 2 micron light is      absorbed by the CO.sub.2 within physiological sensor 100, and the      remainder is reflected. The light from the LEDs outside the CO.sub.2      absorption bands is reflected and acts as a reference. The 470 nm light      energy excites fluorescence in the oxygen sensitive fluorescent dye      contained within physiological sensor 100. The red fluorescence light is      coupled back into optical fiber 102b. The light returning from      physiological sensor 100 via optical fiber 102b is split by wavelength      division multiplexor 213, with the red 620 nm light being directed to      silicon avalanche photodiode 214-3 for detection in order to provide an      indication of the oxygen concentration detected by physiological sensor.      100. The returning light within the region of approximately 2 micron is      split by fused taper coupler 219 and directed through background filter      215-1 (passing 2110 nm) to infrared detector 214-1, and signal filter      215-2 (passing 2019 nm) to IR signal detector 214-2. Signal detector 214-2      serves to provide an indication of the carbon dioxide concentration      measured by physiological sensor 100, as adjusted by the amount of      background light which is detected by background detector 214-1. The pass      bands of the background and signal filters are dependent on the polymer      used (silicone rubber in the above example). </PAR><PAR>  The following parts list is indicative of the type of components which may      be used to construct the embodiment depicted in FIG. 2. </PAR><TBL>  ______________________________________                                         Component from FIG. 2                                                                            Component                                                    ______________________________________                                         red/green LED 202-1                                                                              Hewlett-Packard                                                                HPMP-4000                                                    N.sub.2 laser 202-2                                                                              Laser Science, Inc.
