(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Erica SchroederandM;To manage large numbers of CAD drawings, buyers find electronicdocument-management systems (EDMSs) indispensable.andP;  According to some,however, Database Applications Inc.'s CADEXnet and ACS Telecom Corp.'sAutoEDMS could use some improvement.andM;David Lewis, a CADEXnet user and senior draftsman for an electronics firm inGlenview, Ill., wanted a product that would help him keep track of AutodeskInc.andP;  AutoCAD files and let him attach 16-character file names to thesedrawings (AutoCAD adheres to DOS' limit of eight-character file names).andM;&quot;The most important thing is quick access to your files, and you can't reallyput a cost on that because it'll start costing on you for not having thedata,&quot; he said.andM;Lewis, who uses CADEXnet in conjunction with AutoCAD, Ventura Publisher andWordStar, manages 14 stations using CADEXnet and plans to move to 28.andM;Although Lewis is generally pleased with CADEXnet, he said the VAX version ofthe program would fill his needs more fully.andM;&quot;[Database Applications'] initial product was OK, but the VAX product wasmore what we were looking for,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;But we're on a PC network.&quot;andM;Craig Campbell, vice president of Campbell Industries Inc., a manufacturingfirm in Des Moines, Iowa, looked at several expensive AutoCAD managerprograms, but decided CADEXnet was the best value.andM;Campbell, who uses CADEXnet on a Novell-based network with IBM PS/2 Model70's ran into some problems with CADEXnet when it was installed.andM;For example, &quot;It [operates as] a fairly large TSR,&quot; said Campbell.andP;  &quot;When yourun dBASE IV plus CADEXnet, you can run out of [memory] space.&quot; He added,however, that Database Applications' technical staff helped solve theproblem.andM;Because Campbell uses removable disks, he also faces problems with keepingtrack of files.andM;&quot;You have to have all your drawings on one disk, because if they're not onthe computer, [CADEXnet] won't know where they are,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I can'tspread my projects over more than one disk.andP;  We generate so much data, it'shard to keep it all in one spot.andP;  And we're not project-oriented -- we usethe same data we used 20 years ago.&quot;andM;Some of CADEXnet's strengths include a strong, easy-to-use interface andrevision control, according to Lewis.andM;Revision control &quot;is a very nice feature,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;In a corporation, there are many revisions, and [the program] keeps track ofthem automatically,&quot; said Campbell.andP;  &quot;The user interface is very easy.andO;People here find it's a simple relation between an index card and an [AutoCADfile].&quot;andM;&quot;It ties the system of modified drawings,&quot; Lewis added.andP;  &quot;If you scan in apaper drawing, it'll keep track of the file through AutoCAD, all the waythrough to the printing of the file.&quot;andM;Campbell said his favorite feature of CADEXnet is its ability to search forany field or drawing.andM;He added that he would like to see the ability to assign a number to a fileadded to CADEXnet.andM;&quot;It randomly picks a number, and I wish I could keep the old numbers on thefile [to smooth record-keeping],&quot; he added.andM;In addition, Campbell said he would like to see the ability to do an audittrail.andM;Doug Medley, systems manager for Degussa Corp., an international chemicalcompany in Theodore, Ala., runs a beta version of AutoEDMS on a NovellNetWare network.andM;AutoEDMS allows Medley to manage four plotters off one server and more than2,000 drawings every month.andM;&quot;I need to be able to control where and how users file drawings,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;We hire a lot of contractors, and we need to be able to keep track of theirwork after they leave.andP;  It really means I can manage the system as oneperson, instead of having two or three people not knowing what's going on.&quot;andM;For Medley, the main advantage of AutoEDMS is that it eliminates the need toload and unload AutoCAD each time a user changes drawings.andM;&quot;It's a big time-saver, especially for our users who edit four to fivedrawings an hour,&quot; he said.andM;Another plus for Medley is AutoEDMS' ability to plot a drawing directly,without having to run AutoCAD.andM;&quot;The plot engine technology they've come up with is almost error-free.andP;  To beable to run four plotters off one server is amazing,&quot; he said.andM;Steve Stone, civil engineer/systems analyst for consulting firm HansonEngineers Inc., in Springfield, Ill., is planning to upgrade from ACSTelecom's earlier release, called EDMS, to AutoEDMS.andM;He chose the upgrade for its plotter-sharing capabilities anddocument-management features.andM;&quot;When they added the [database-management system] capabilities, we went to itfor drawing-management needs,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Plus, it was easy to use andunderstand.&quot;andM;The only problem with AutoEDMS, according to Medley, is that it requires alarge amount of memory, which he said could be a problem for potentialbuyers.andM;&quot;It takes about 542K to run, so you have to do a lot of juggling,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;It takes up a little more memory than a lot of people have.&quot;andM;Stone said he is facing extra costs with the upgrade to AutoEDMS.andM;&quot;We are having to do a few modifications to our system,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We rundual-screen systems and have only monochrome monitors.andP;  We have to replacesome monitors, because AutoEDMS only supports VGA.andP;  I think the capabilitiesof AutoEDMS are enough to offset the cost, but it's just kind of a pain.andO;Other than that, we shouldn't have any problems with it.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
