Upto now, for applications resulting in production in large numbers, theonly solution was to construct each unit according to individual requirements.This carried several major disadvantages: design costs were high, andit was impossible to modify the specifications or to adapt the productto a new, but similar application. A survey of the gas industry requirementsfor small data acquisition units enabled the Process Control and ElectronicsSection to define and develop equipment well adapted to the majorityof situations. ALPAGA (small scale data acquisition for gas applications)is a low cost unit which nevertheless provides the functions normallyrequired in industrial micro-computing (various forms of date acquisition,control possibilities, clock, display, transmission, considerable operatingautonomy with battery). In addition, it may e programmed on site in BASICby a non-specialist, to solve a multitude of problems. Examples of utilizationin fluid metering, flow rate correction, data acquisition, on site recordingand processing of measurements, remote operation, etc., ... are describedin the paper. The programs are represented by a few lines of instructionsand may be adapted to all specific needs by the operator himself.</TEXT></DOC>
