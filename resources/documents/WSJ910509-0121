According to documents filed with a commission that ismonitoring the treaty in Vienna, the Czech government, whichhad previously asked for U.S. help to get out of the armsbusiness, is trying to avoid destroying at least half of itsweapons that fall under the terms of the treaty.</LP><TEXT>   The Czech move, U.S. officials say, could open the secondmajor loophole in the treaty, which calls for drasticreductions in the amount of weapons in Europe. Earlier, theSoviet Union announced it was shifting some 3,500 of itstanks and other army weaponry to coastal defense forces thatcome under the Soviet navy. Naval forces are exempt from thetreaty, which was signed by 22 nations in November.   One U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, saidthat the U.S. already has protested arms deals the Czechs areclose to signing with Syria and Iran, which are eager to buyCzech-made, Soviet-designed T-72 tanks.   Any Czech sales to the Middle East fly in the face of theefforts of the U.S. and its allies to curb the flow of armsinto the region. U.S. officials fear that weakening of theresolve behind the conventional arms treaty could result in a&quot;cascade&quot; of tanks, planes and other weapons pouring intodeveloping nations.   Czechoslovakia has urged the other treaty signers toconsider its cash-strapped position. Early in its tenure, thegovernment of President Vaclav Havel said it wanted tocurtail overseas arms sales, but that intention has beenthwarted by economic pressures and the fact that Czech tankand other arms factories tend to be in Slovakia, which hasfew other sources of employment and is threatening to secede.This summer, at the request of the Czech government, the U.S.Defense Department is sending a team to help Czech officialsfigure out ways to convert the arms factories to productionof commercial goods.   Rita Klimova, the Czech ambassador to the U.S., said shewasn't aware of her government's plans to exempt 5,500weapons from the treaty, but she asserted in an interviewthat its ultimate goal is to earn enough hard currency from&quot;final arms sales&quot; to convert its defense industry to theproduction of civilian goods.   &quot;I would assume that these sales would not go totroublemaking countries,&quot; she said, adding that her countryis faced with mounting oil bills.   That problem began when the Soviet Union sharply cut itssubsidized oil exports to Czechoslovakia. It worsened at thestart of the Persian Gulf war, when Czechoslovakia stoppedselling arms to Iraq, which had been paying for them withcrude oil.</TEXT></DOC>
