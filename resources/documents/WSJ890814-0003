Meanwhile, negotiators for Southwestern Bell Corp. and the Communications Workers of America reached a tentative agreement covering nearly 40,700 employees after negotiations continued into the evening yesterday. Wages and health care issues were the final items resolved.    In Denver, U S West Inc. and union negotiators representing 40,000 employees met yesterday to iron out details of a verbal agreement reached early in the morning. Neither company experienced work stoppages.    Little progress was reported in the weeklong strikes against Nynex Corp., Pacific Telesis Group, San Francisco, and Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic Corp. Negotiators for Pacific Telesis's and Bell Atlantic's telephone companies have held informal talks with their union counterparts in the past week, but formal talks haven't resumed. At New York-based Nynex, neither the company nor the union has picked up the phone to initiate discussions, union and company spokesmen said.    In the four strikes, the sides appeared far apart over wages and health care benefits. Union officials contend that workers haven't received a fair share of the Baby Bells' healthy profits. At Bell Atlantic, for instance, the union said that from the Bell System divestiture in 1984 until last year, profit climbed 20%, executive compensation jumped 43%, the cost of living rose 13.3%, and workers' compensation rose 11.9%.    The health care issue is particularly contentious, especially at Nynex. Generally, the companies want workers to pick up a greater portion of their health care costs, and the unions contend the proposals represent significant wage cuts. Moreover, union leaders fear that cost-shifting will harm workers and ultimately will raise health care costs because employees will delay seeking treatment.    The Bell companies, on the other hand, have been under pressure from Wall Street to control their costs, and the companies have been pushing for so-called incentive regulation that would allow them to earn higher profits if they cut expenses. Although the local phone companies are essentially monopolies, their parent companies also cite the need to rein in costs as their markets become increasingly competitive.    The strike against Chicago-based Ameritech began immediately after the three-year contracts expired at midnight Saturday. The contracts covered nearly 40,000 employees of the five local phone companies in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin, as well as Ameritech Services, where 600 union members are engaged in purchasing and materials management. The union and the company conducted separate talks for the six units.    The strike follows a settlement reached a month ago between Ameritech's Illinois Bell unit and its biggest union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents nearly 13,000 employees. The company also reached agreements with IBEW locals representing a total of 570 employees at Indiana Bell and Ameritech Services. Communications Workers of America and company officials were waiting to see whether IBEW members would cross CWA picket lines today.    Of the seven regional Baby Bell companies formed by the Bell System divestiture, only Atlanta-based BellSouth Corp. reached a tentative agreement with the CWA before its contract expired a week ago. The union accepted major changes in the health care package three years ago, and although the wage increase was a modest 4% in the first year and firm increases of 1% in each of the next two years, the company retained a cost-of-living adjustment that would cover about 80% of the effects of inflation. </TEXT></DOC>
