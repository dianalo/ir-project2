The pilots union also said its 41,000 members would not flyplanes or routes sold to other airlines by Eastern, which declaredbankruptcy last week, unless a comparable number of Eastern pilotswere also hired, and at full seniority. An industry group said suchan action would be illegal.   John Bavis, head of the Eastern pilots group, said the strikebenefit _ $2,400 a month _ was designed to remove the company's``last enticement'' to pilots who have refused to work until theMachinists settle. Only 2 percent of unionized Eastern pilots havecrossed picket lines, he said.   ``Despite management's claim, we haven't cracked, we haven'tgiven in,'' he said, estimating that the company was operating withfewer than 200 pilots, many of whom he said have already worked themaximum 100 hours a month allowed by the Federal AviationAdministration.   ``This is a critical time for all airline pilots,'' said HenryDuffy, the president of the pilots union. ``All 41,000 pilots willreach deep into their pockets,'' kicking in an average of $300 amonth, ``to help the Eastern pilots who are reaching deep withinthemselves to cope with the personal and professional risks of theiraction.''   Duffy said the union would also draw on its $37 million strikefund to begin paying the strike benefit, which will give membersless than half their regular salaries.   The pilots will also get interest-free loans of up to $2,000 tocover paychecks for work performed before the strike but whichEastern refused to issue after filing for bankruptcy.   John Mazor, a union spokesman, said the union has given financialsupport to pilots in previous walkouts but has never put togethersuch an extensive package of payments, loans and other action.   Late next week, if the strike that began March 4 is still on, the8,500 striking machinists will get upwards of $100 in benefits fromtheir union, the International Association of Machinists, said unionspokesman Bob Kalaski.   The pilots union, in a meeting Monday of members representing 47airlines, unanimously agreed to refuse to fly Eastern routes orplanes that might be sold to other airlines unless Eastern pilotswere hired to go along with the assets.   Duffy said the pilots agreed to make their position known toairlines that might negotiate with Eastern to buy its assets. Theunion accuses Frank Lorenzo, head of Texas Air Corp., which ownsEastern, of planning to dismantle Eastern and cash in on its assets.   Mazor said a refusal by pilots to fly planes or routes purchasedfrom Eastern would not violate the union contracts with the carriers.   But the Air Transport Association, which represents airlines,said such a refusal would be an illegal ``contained strike'' underthe Railway Labor Act which governs airline disputes. SpokeswomanLeslie Rowland said if pilots object to flying planes from Eastern,they should file a grievance and continue to work until it issettled.   Eastern is running only a small fraction of its more than 1,000daily flights. Officials have said they plan to scale down theairline, possibly selling off such assets as planes and routes toother carriers.   A $365 million sale of the airline's profitable Northeast shuttleoperations to New York developer Donald Trump is awaiting approvalfrom the FAA and the federal bankruptcy court in New York. TheTransportation Department gave its approval earlier.   An $85 million sale of eight Eastern airport gates atPhiladelphia and two Philadelphia-Canada routes to USAir is alsopending. USAir spokesman David Shipley said he would not speculateon what effect the pilots' position might have on the sale, whichalso would not take effect until several levels of governmentapproval are secured, including that of the bankruptcy court.   Mazor acknowledged that a union directive last week to allairlines' member pilots telling them to follow the mosttime-consuming safe-flying procedures did not result in significantairport delays.   He said about 60 percent of pilots were following the procedures.   The Air Transport Association had urged the pilots not to followthe directive, which it characterized as a ``slowdown order.''</TEXT></DOC>
