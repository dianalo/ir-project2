L. 100-233, 101 Stat. 1662 et seq.I find that these regulations comply with that statute and that FmHA hasthe authority to propose such regulations pursuant to that Act and to section399 of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1989).<ITAG tagnum="6">Christopher Hicks,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">General Counsel.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of IRIA</ITAG>The USDA has developed a Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis (PRIA)due to the effect the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 will have on theeconomy. There are a number of requirements in the Act, however the mostsignificant requirements are the loan restructuring with debt write-downprovisions and the provisions for a secondary market. The secondary marketprovisions will be covered in a separate document. The PRIA for this documentwas summarized in the proposed rule published on May 23, 1988 [53 FR 18392].The analysis showed that of about 118,000 borrowers delinquent in early1988, about 37,000 borrowers were considered able to resolve delinquencythrough normal servicing actions, including subordination, reschedulingand deferral.Of the remaining 81,000 borrowers eligible for consideration of restructuringwith write-down of debt, about 16,000 were estimated to be able to showrepayment on remaining debt and qualify for the write-down. An estimated54,000 were estimated to be unable to show repayment ability and wouldbe rejected for write-down. The remaining 11,000 delinquent borrowers wereestimated ineligible for write-downs since their debt was less than therecovery value from liquidation.The study estimated losses for FmHA to total $2.7 billion for borrowersable to cashflow and qualify for the write-down and $6.7 billion for borrowersunable to show repayment ability and rejected for restructuring with write-down.These losses could be reduced by an estimated $1 billion through recaptureprovisions.FmHA has already incurred significant loan losses due to deteriorationin collateral and lien position that have already been incurred. Lossesdue to liquidation costs will be included in the write-down for borrowerswho qualify for restructuring or add to loan losses on foreclosures. Thestudy concluded that to a large extent the estimated losses associatedwith debt restructuring are unavoidable.These estimates are subject to a wide range of variables affecting thenumber of delinquent borrowers who qualify for write-down and the extentof the write-down. For example, liquidation costs included in the write-downwill vary with the average time property is held in inventory. For stateswith slow-moving inventory the estimated liquidation costs, and the amountof write-down, will be greater than states with short turn around for inventoryproperty. The extent of the drought will also impact the number of delinquentborrowers, future prices, and repayment prospects.Despite these uncertainties, the estimates contained in the PreliminaryImpact Analysis are considered to be substantially indicative of the numberof borrowers qualifying for the write-down and associated costs of debtrestructuring under the preliminary regulations are revised for interimfinal publication. Changes in the interim final regulations are likelyto affect servicing and property management procedures more than the extentof debt adjustment under the restructuring provisions. For example, theinterim final regulations have been revised to facilitate assistance toborrowers rejected for restructuring. Greater use of lease-back and buy-backprovisions are expected through simultaneous credit sales of both realestate and chattel. These and other impacts are considered in an addendumto the revised impact analysis.Since these provisions are required by the Act, other alternatives werenot considered.<ITAG tagnum="84">Programs Affected</ITAG>These changes affect the following FmHA programs as listed in the catalogof Federal Domestic Assistance:<ITAG tagnum="15">10.404_Emergency Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">10.406_Farm Operating Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">10.407_Farm Ownership Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">10.410_Low Income Housing Loans (Section 502 Rural Housing Loans)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">10.416_Soil and Water Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Consultation</ITAG>1. For the reasons set forth in the final rule related to Notice 7 CFR3015, Subpart V (48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983) and FmHA Instruction 1940-J,``Intergovernmental Review of Farmers Home Administration Programs andActivities'' (December 23, 1983), Emergency Loans, Farm Operating Loans,and Farm Ownership Loans are excluded with the exception of nonfarm enterpriseactivity from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmentalconsultation with State and local officials.2. The Soil and Water Loans Programs is subject to the provisions of ExecutiveOrder 12372 and FmHA Instruction 1940-J.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact Statement</ITAG>This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR Part 1940, SubpartG, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the determination of FmHA that thisaction does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affectingthe quality of the human environment, and in accordance with the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969, (Pub. L. 91-190), an Environmental ImpactStatement is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-233) requires a numberof changes in the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) regulations and howwe will continue to do business with our Farm borrowers. Due to the greatnumber of changes and to expedite the implementation of the ``Act,'' weare publishing the revisions in FmHA regulations in several separate issuances.They are as follows:1. Section 607_County CommitteesAllows one member of the County Committee to be an FmHA Farmer Programborrower and removes the requirement that a member must derive the principalpart of income from farming.This was implemented March 24, 1988.2. Section 608_Administrative AppealsRequires FmHA to set up a separate independent nationwide appeals systemfor all FmHA borrowers. This was implemented July 12, 1988.3. A Portion of Section 611_Income ReleaseProvides for the release of up to $18,000 of normal income security forfamily living and Farm operating expenses to borrowers that have been acceleratedbut not foreclosed.The FmHA field offices were notified on February 2, 1988, to implementthis provision immediately.4. Section 613_Interest Rate Reduction Program; Demonstration Project forPurchase of System LandProvides for an FmHA guarantee of up to 95 percent of the loan if thereis an interest rate reduction for the loan for Farm Credit Administration(FCA) inventory property when the Farm Credit Administration District hasreceived financial assistance from the Farm Credit System Assistance Board.FmHA and FCA signed a Memorandum of Understanding for this on March 3,1988.5. Section 619_Payment of Losses on Guaranteed LoansProvides for FmHA to pay a lender estimated losses either through debtwrite-down or reorganization through bankruptcy for FmHA guaranteed loans.6. Section 711_Improvement of Secondary Market Operations for Loans Guaranteedby the Farmers Home AdministrationProvides the pooling of notes for issuing pooling certificates for saleon the secondary market.Section 803_Sale of Rural Development NotesAllows the borrower who signed a note the opportunity to purchase the notebefore the note is offered for sale. This is for community programs. Itwas implemented on March 14, 1988.7. Title V_State Mediation Programs<ITAG tagnum="81">Subtitle A_Matching Grants for State Mediation Programs</ITAG><T3>Section 501_Qualifications. </T3>Establishes the procedures and requirementsfor FmHA to certify a State for a State mediation program.<T3>Section 502_Matching Grants to States. </T3>Establishes the proceduresfor receiving grants from FmHA for State mediation programs.There are a number of sections of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 (``Act'')that are very important to FmHA Farm borrowers. The Act requires theirimplementation. It will allow many Farm borrowers to continue to Farm andwill, at the same time, assist in minimizing losses to the Government.Since most of these sections of the Act are interrelated, they are combinedinto one separate issuance of regulations. Some of the sections requireonly minor changes in the regulations while others are major changes. Thedebt write-down provisions involve major additions to the regulations.8. These Interim RulesProposed rules were published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> [53 FR 18392] on May 23, 1988, with a 30 daycomment period. In view of the short statutory requirement for implementingthese sections of Pub. L. 100-233, only a 30 day comment period was allowed.We believe that the short implementation period required by the Act showsthat Congress intended for the claimants to benefit from them quickly afterconsidering public comments. Any further delay in implementing these regulationswould be thwarting Congressional intent. Therefore, we are publishing themas an interim rule with a further comment period.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of the Revisions and the Comments Received</ITAG>In response to the proposed rule, 247 respondents commented in writingby the close of business on June 24, 1988. The deadline for receiving writtencomments was June 22, 1988. Many of the respondents' letters containedcomments on a number of the sections of the proposed rule. Comments werereceived from individuals, FmHA employees, interest groups, United StatesCongressmen, and State government officials. Many of the comments werecopies of very similar letters. A number of the respondents indicated thatthey endorsed or concurred with the 116 pages of comments with attachmentsfrom the Farmers Legal Action Group, St. Paul, Minnesota.Several of the respondents requested that some of the provisions of theregulations be published again as a proposed rule with a comment period.However, since most of the sections of the Act are interrelated, it wouldbe very difficult and time-consuming to separate the regulations to publishpart of them as a final rule. Also, many areas of the country are sufferingfrom a severe drought. Many farmers are in immediate need of the benefitsof this Act. Several Congressmen have recommended that FmHA publish theseregulations as an interim rule with a comment period to expedite the implementationof the Act.It is our opinion that, due to the drought, many farmers are in urgentneed immediately of the benefits of this Act and that after considerationof all the constructive comments received for the proposed rule, the revisionsto the proposed rule provide workable regulations that will be of immediateassistance to many farmers and will help in minimizing losses to the Government.Major changes in regulations such as these almost always have to be fine-tunedby additional revisions after they are implemented. Therefore, the proposedrule with revisions is issued as an interim rule with a 60 day commentperiod.Comments are discussed as ``A. Summary of General Comments,'' and ``B.Specific Comments and Regulation Revisions.''A. Summary of General CommentsA very great number of individuals did not specifically address any particularsection of the proposed rule, but made general statements such as:1. The regulations are unfair to those who have to pay their debts in fullat higher interest rates.2. The regulations are discriminatory.3. The regulations are a terrible burden and a waste of taxpayer's money.4. Respondent is going to suspend payments to FmHA until the respondentreceives a satisfactory explanation.5. Keeping these farmers in business adds to the surplus on one hand, whileon the other hand, the Government buys up the surplus and supports prices.6. Credit is too easy. The Government should foreclose.7. There is no incentive to do a good job.8. Many FmHA borrowers are poor managers; they spend money they do nothave.9. This is another shove to make a proud, hardworking person into a freeloader.10. Such regulations dampen and corrupt successful attitudes.11. This regulation will not help the hardworking farmers who pay theirbills.12. Some people succeed and some fail. Let the good survive and the badget out.13. Some Farm the land, some Farm the Government.14. I am mad as hell and tired, you should write down all farmers debts.15. I am happy to see that small farmers can have their debts written downto where they can handle it and stay in business.16. This program will assure there is food on the shelves in the grocerystores. We would have asked the Grange to support this program.17. Selling the Farm back to the borrower will not solve the problem.B. Specific Comments and Regulation RevisionsThe comments and regulations revisions will be addressed in the order thatthe regulations appear in the CFR.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1809_APPRAISALS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_Appraisal of Farms and Leasehold Interest</ITAG>Section 1809.1 is amended to correct a reference and to remove Recreation(RL) loans from the paragraph as this program is removed from FmHA regulations.No comments were received on this amendment. The proposed rule is adoptedas proposed.<T3>Section 1809.4_The three-way approach to market value. </T3>Respondentscommented on other regulations that the price of suitable farmland shouldreflect the annual production value. FmHA uses the capitalization valueto determine this. Therefore, we have revised this section to clarify theprocedure for this.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1902_SUPERVISED BANK ACCOUNTS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_Loan and Grant Disbursements</ITAG>The agency is revising Subpart A of Part 1902 of the regulations to deletethe requirement that the original cancelled check must be returned by thebank when countersigned checks are used and keep the regulations in linewith evolving technology in the commercial banking industry.<T3>Section 1902.1_General. </T3>The amendments to this section providedfor the deletion of Exhibits C and D, changing the word ``bank'' to ``financialinstitutions'' and allowing the placement of payments in a supervised bankaccount when a borrower is in liquidation and State law requires a reversalof the acceleration if payment is accepted. No unfavorable comments werereceived regarding the deletion of Exhibits C and D and the word changefrom ``bank'' to ``financial institutions.'' Thus, the Agency adopts theproposed amendment for these two items. Several comments were receivedon the placement of payments received in a supervised bank account whenan account is in liquidation. The respondents concerns were that interestwould continue to accrue upon the account as the payment would not be applieddirectly to a loan account. The Agency has amended andSection; 1955.15(d)(3)of Subpart A of Part 1955 of this chapter, deleting this requirement andhas deleted the reference to andSection; 1955.15(d)(3) of Subpart A of Part1955 of this chapter.<T3>Section 1902.2_Policies concerning disbursement of funds. </T3>Theamendments to this section provided for the deletion of Exhibits C andD, the submitting of Forms FmHA 440-57 or 1944-57 to the State Office ratherthan the Finance Office, change ``bank'' to ``financial institution,''and allowing financial institutions using a truncation process to provideFmHA with a microfilm copy or other reasonable facsimile of the originalcancelled check when requested by FmHA at no charge either to FmHA or tothe borrower, and the original check will not have to be provided to FmHAand/or the borrower with the bank statement. One FmHA respondent commentedon the submitting of Forms FmHA 440-57 or 1944-57 to the State Office insteadof the Finance Office and the subsequent ordering of checks by the Countyor District Offices. All field offices now have the capability of orderingsubsequent checks by the Automated Data Processing System (ADPS) and theAgency has revised this section to clarify when the County or DistrictOffices will submit Form FmHA 440-57 or 1944-57 and how to order subsequentchecks. The Agency chooses to adopt the proposed rule as amended.One respondent commented that the regulation did not adequately explainwhen it was ``necessary'' to place funds in a supervised bank account.The Agency adopts a change to paragraph (a)(6) of andSection; 1902.2, inwhich the County Supervisor and the borrower will agree that special supervisionis needed in the management of the borrower's financial affairs. This supervisorytechnique will be temporary in nature and cannot exceed one year unlessthe District Director agrees to an extension of time. The Agency adoptsthe proposed amendment.<T3>Section 1902.3_Procedures to follow in fund disbursement.</T3> Onerespondent commented that advances are now requested by the ADPS system.This change was made.Exhibit B was revised to change ``bank'' to ``financial institutions,''and to modernize certain legal expressions. Since no unfavorable commentswere received, the Agency adopts the proposed amendment.Exhibits C and D were deleted and since no unfavorable comments were received,the Agency has deleted these two Exhibits.The rest of the proposed rule is adopted as proposed. No other commentswere received.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1910_GENERAL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_Receiving and Processing Applications</ITAG>This subpart provides the procedures for receiving and processing FmHAapplications for services. This subpart was revised in part to incorporatesection 623, ``Farm Ownership Outreach Program to Socially DisadvantagedIndividuals'' of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. This section providesfor a farm ownership outreach program for persons who are members of anygroup with respect to which an individual may be identified as a sociallydisadvantaged individual to encourage the acquisition of inventory farmlandof FmHA. Several comments were received regarding the method of outreach,the targeting of funds and the identification of the socially disadvantaged.These comments are addressed in the appropriate sections of the regulations.<T3>Section 1910.1_General.</T3> The Agency proposed to delete referenceto recreation (RL) loans and to refer to <T3>insured</T3> section 502 and 504 Rural Housing (RH) for clarification.No negative responses were received. The Agency adopts the proposed amendments.Several respondents commented that the phrase ``other written statements''concerning information the County Supervisor would provide to an applicant/borrowerwas too vague and that the Agency should clearly state the content of theinformation provided. The Agency adopts a change which deletes the wording``other written statements'' and provides for the distribution of the appropriateFmHA program regulations.One respondent was concerned that while historic preservation concernsare addressed in various ways by subsequent sections, in andSection;1910.1there is no clear and simple methods which will assure historic preservationissues will ever be addressed in the granting of FmHA assistance. The Agencybelieves its present process as outlined in Subpart G of Part 1940 of thischapter covers the respondent's concerns. The Agency also plans to updatethe environmental regulations in the near future to conform with the AdvisoryCouncil on Historic Preservation recommendations. These changes will beaddressed in a separate regulation.<T3>Section 1910.2_Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and Regulation B.</T3>One respondent commented that additional language should be included thatwould not deny any applicant assistance or services if the applicant, ingood faith, exercised any right under State or Federal law. The Agencybelieves that it is not necessary to adopt this recommendation, as applicantsare already protected if a State or Federal law takes precedence over FmHA'sregulations.<T3>Section 1910.3_Receiving applications.</T3> Several comments were receivedregarding the filing of a written application and that applicants willbe encouraged to file a written application even though funds may not becurrently available. It was reported this is a standard practice in someFmHA field offices to discourage the filing of written applications whenfunds are not currently available. It was suggested that a statement beplaced on Form FmHA 410-1, ``Application for FmHA Services,'' that stated``you should file a written application even if FmHA funds are not available.''It was also suggested that FmHA either post notices or provide writtennotices that an application is required for debt restructuring. The Agencyagrees with the comment and has amended this section to stress that allapplicants will be encouraged to file a written application, that no oralor written statements will be made to applicants that would discouragethem from applying, and that completed applications must be consideredin the date order received. The proposed amendment is adopted as changed.One respondent was concerned that Form FmHA 410-1 was not included in theproposed rule. FmHA normal policy is not to publish forms in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Most FmHA forms are readily available in anyFmHA office. The statute does not require the publication of forms in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>.FmHA added a provision that provides for County Office employees to beresponsible for receiving loan applications and giving a preliminary explanationof the services available. This will provide for a greater utilizationof FmHA's workforce in meeting the needs of applicants. The proposed amendmentis adopted.One provision added to this section was to differentiate between jointapplications for Single Family Housing loans and for Farmer Program loans,and that husbands and wives who jointly request a Farmer Program loan willbe considered a joint operation. One respondent indicated the regulationswere not clear as to those applicants who are married and request a farmerprogram loan if they are considered a joint operation and what the loanlimits would be. The Agency agrees and has clarified the regulations tostress that if both parties want to file together, they will be considereda joint operation and both must meet the eligibility requirements. It willbe the responsibility of the County Office employees to explain to theapplicants that if they insist on filing together, they will be considereda joint operation. If each party has a separate and feasible operation,they can file as individuals and each receive the maximum loan limits.If they file as a joint operation, they are only entitled to one maximumloan limit. The Agency adopts these changes to the proposed rule.Several parties responded regarding the new emphasis the Agency was placingon the requirements for a cosigner. Their concerns were that the Agencywas requiring a cosigner in certain instances. They felt that the onlytime a cosigner was required was when the applicant had to rely upon thecosigner for repayemnt or that the security provided by the applicant wasnot adequate to secure the loan request. The Agency agrees and has adoptedthe change that for Farmer Program loans, a cosigner will be requestedonly when the applicant cannot meet the repayment or security requirementsof the loan request.<T3>Section 1910.4_Processing applications. </T3>Several parties respondedregarding the information which an applicant must submit to the Agencyto have a complete application on which to take action. They were concernedthat a number of the items listed were the responsibility of the Agencyto provide for a completed application, thus out of the control of theapplicant. Other concerns were that an applicant should not have to provideincome tax records when the applicant had a set of financial records tosupport the request; up to five-years production history should also includeexpense history; and an applicant who is applying to purchase a farm musthave an option for the application to be complete. The Agency has amendedthis section and has adopted these changes.Several respondents commented that there was no means to identify an applicantas a socially disadvantaged individual on the application. Form FmHA 410-1has a section which indicates race that the applicant may complete if theapplicant so desires. This section will allow those applicants who aremembers of socially disadvantaged groups and who wish to be consideredunder the socially disadvantaged program that they may do so. One respondentindicated that they needed a better definition of socially disadvantagedindividuals in this section. The definition of socially disadvantaged hasbeen clarified in andSection; 1943.4 of Subpart A of Part 1943 of this chapter.The Agency believes the issue of identification is properly addressed inthe application and no changes will be made to the application.Several respondents commented that the notice of the programs for ``sociallydisadvantaged individuals'' would not be provided to an applicant untilafter a completed loan application was received. The Agency agrees withthe comments and has revised its regulations to provide Exhibit B, ``Letterto Notify Socially Disadvantaged Applicants/Borrowers About the Availabilityof Insured Farm Ownership (FO) Loans and the Acquisition/Leasing of FmHAInventory Farmland,'' to all socially disadvantaged individuals at thetime they make initial contact with FmHA and/or when an application forFO assistance is received. The proposed amendment is adopted as changed.One respondent commented that the Agency had not implemented the 1985 FoodSecurity Act which provided that all adverse actions are appealable. TheAgency has clarified its appeal procedure and has amended this sectionto refer to Subpart B of Part 1900 of this chapter for guidance in providingan applicant with appeal rights referring to appealable decisions becauseSubpart B of Part 1900 controls this aspect of the notification process.The Agency adopts this change to the proposed rule.One respondent commented that the amendment did not spell out what constitutes``a specific reason'' for an unfavorable decision. The respondent wenton to indicate that many times an unfavorable decision by a County Committeewould be so vague the applicant would not be able to tell for what specificreason the application was rejected. Both andSection;andSection; 1910.4(j)and 1910.6(b) have been amended to require that the decision maker willclearly state the specific reason(s) for the rejection in the letter tothe applicant and the factual justification for this action must be setforth. The Agency adopts this change to the proposed rule.Several comments were received regarding the time an application remainsactive and the Agency's determination as to when to withdraw an activeapplication when the applicant has expressed a lack of interest in pursuingthe application. This change allowed FmHA the ability to update its applicationfiles in a timely and orderly manner. It provided the means for FmHA tomaintain files with current financial and operational information so thatat a later date, if the applicant wants to proceed with the application,the burden of updating the application will be minimal. There was someconfusion on the part of some of the respondents, as they felt the applicationsreceived for FO loans would only remain active for 12 months, while theapplications for other Farmer Program loans would remain active for 25months. All applications will remain active for 12 months from the datea completed application is received. If the applicant has indicated thatthe applicant is no longer interested in pursuing the application and theapplication has been withdrawn, disapproved or closed, the applicationswill then be handled in accordance with andSection; 2033.7 of FmHA Instruction2033-A (available in any FmHA office), which provides for the retainingof these files for 25 months before they can be disposed. For additionalclarification, FmHA has amended this section to allow the County Supervisorto notify those applicants whose requests were not funded during the eleventhmonth following receipt of a completed application, that in order for theapplication to remain active, the applicant must provide a written noticerequesting that the application remain active. The Agency adopts thesechanges to the proposed rule.<T3>Section 1910.5_Evaluating applications. </T3>Several respondents voicedconcern that delinquencies that have been resolved through debt restructuringor other forms of primary loan servicing should not be used as an indicationof lack of creditworthiness, in addition to foreclosures, judgments, delinquentpayments, etc., not being considered as an indicator of unacceptable creditworthinessunder certain circumstances, the Agency has adopted an amendment that willinclude those debts resolved in accordance with andSection; 1951.906 of SubpartS of Part 1951 of this chapter in the list of items which will not indicatean unacceptable credit history. The Agency has also clarified that whennon-payment of a debt was due to circumstances beyond the applicant/borrower'scontrol, this will not constitute an unacceptable credit history. The proposedamendment is adopted as changed.There were also a few respondents who felt that applicants who had theirdebts settled without payment or had declared bankruptcy were not goodcredit risks and those items should be deleted from the amendment. TheAgency believes that to change the regulation regarding the debt settlementprovision would unfairly penalize those applicants who attempted to resolvetheir FmHA debts within the normal framework and FmHA has agreed to thisapproach. As far as bankruptcies are concerned, to hold a bankruptcy againstan applicant would be contrary to the basic intent of the Bankruptcy Codeto provide a debtor with a ``fresh start'' or ``clean slate.'' Therefore,the Agency does not adopt this suggestion.<T3>Section 1910.6_Notification of applicant. </T3>There was one respondentwhose major concern with this section was that many times the County Committeewill deny eligibility and the County Supervisor would also advise the applicantof the reasons why the loan would have been denied even if the County Committeehad determined the application eligible. This practice has an adverse impacton the applicant as the applicant must address all of the feasible reasonsin addition to the County Committee's reasons at the appeal hearing. TheAgency agrees and has amended this section to include separate eligibilityand feasibility sections. The Agency has also amended this section to requirethat the specific reasons for the adverse action must have a factual basis.Another respondent was concerned about the notification to applicants whenfunds become available. The suggestion was to provide the notificationby certified mail, return receipt requested. This respondent was also concernedabout the fact that, when a County Supervisor requested updated information,if more than 90 days had passed since Form FmHA 1940-1, ``Request for Obligationof Funds,'' was signed, there was no time limit for how long the CountySupervisory has to review the information. There was also the concern thatadditional clarification was needed as to what the phrase ``significantchanges'' meant and how much additional information was needed for theCounty Supervisor to make the decision. The Agency agrees and the proposedamendment is adopted as changed.<T3>Section 1910.7_Counseling. </T3>One respondent commented that manytimes County Supervisors do not tell farmers about alternative FmHA programsthat might be of benefit to them. The Agency has amended this section torequire that the County Supervisor will discuss all FmHA programs thatmight assist the applicant in achieving the applicant's goals. The proposedamendment is adopted as changed.<T3>Section 1910.8_Reaching an understanding. </T3>One respondent feltthat the Outreach Program and the Targeted Farm Ownership Program shouldbe listed as one of the items to be discussed with the applicant, thata check list should be developed to indicate that each item was discussed,and FmHA should provide written explanatory material to each applicantwho may be members of a socially disadvantaged group during this interviewprocess. Sections 1910.4 of this subpart and 1943.13 of Subpart A of Part1943 of this chapter have been amended to provide information to membersof socially disadvantaged groups at initial contacts and also at the timean application is filed. The Agency believes this issue is properly addressedin the appropriate sections and those amendments will be adopted in therespective sections.<T3>Exhibit A to Subpart A of Part 1910. </T3>One respondent commentedthat Exhibit A, ``Letter for Information Needed for a Complete Farmer ProgramApplication,'' needed clarification and rewriting to make it readable forborrowers. The Agency agrees. Examples which the Agency felt needed tobe clarified included types of financial information requested, what ismeant by up to five years of production history, and a list of all locallenders from whom the applicant is required to obtain written evidenceof the applicant's inability to obtain other credit. The Exhibit was rewrittenfor clarification. The comment regarding ``up to five years'' should beself-explanatory in that if the applicant has 5 years or more of productionhistory, it would mean the past 5 years, and if the applicant is fairlynew in farming, production history would only be required for those yearsfor which it was available. The Agency is concerned that requiring theCounty Supervisor to provide a list of all local lenders whom the applicantis required to contact regarding other credit could result in the appearanceof a conflict of interest if the County Supervisor happens to overlooka couple of lenders in preparing the list and so is not adopting this suggestion.The proposed amendment is adopted as changed.<T3>Exhibit B to Subpart A of Part 1910. </T3>One respondent commentedthat the title to Exhibit B, ``Letter to Notify Applicants About LimitedResource Loans and Socially Disadvantaged Individuals in Obtaining DirectFO Loans and the Acquisition/Leasing of Inventory Farmland,'' did not makesense and that the readability was beyond the limits of some of the individualswho would receive the Exhibit. The Agency agrees with the comment and hasamended the Exhibit so that it addresses only socially disadvantaged individualsand has amended the proposed rule so that it refers back to the originalregulation regarding notification to applicants/borrower about the limitedresources program.Clarifying changes were made to andSection; 1910.3(i) to delete out-of-datereferences to loan programs which are not covered by this regulation. <ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart B_Credit Reports (Individuals)</ITAG><T3>Section 1910.52_General. </T3>This revision was added to the interimrule to update a reference.<ITAG tagnum="81">PART 1924_CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR</ITAG>Subpart A_Planning and Performing Construction and Other Developments.This subpart provides guidance in the planning and performing of constructionand other development when construction or repairs are needed. Section1924.1 was amended to add Softwood Timber (ST) loans and remove Recreation(RL) loans. No negative comments were received. The Agency adopts the proposedamendment.Subpart B_Management Advice to Individual Borrowers and Applicants. Thissubpart provides guidance to FmHA regarding the providing of managementadvice to farmer program loan individual applicants and borrowers. Thissubpart was revised in part to incorporate Section 606 ``Planting and ProductionHistory Guidelines'' of the Agriculture Credit Act of 1987. This sectionprovided for the use of State and county averages when an accurate projectioncannot be made because the applicant's past production history has beenaffected by natural disasters declared under the Disaster Relief Act of1974. A number of comments were received and the Agency has addressed thissection in the appropriate subpart of this section. This section was alsorevised to incorporate provisions of Section 611 ``Income Release,'' whichrequires FmHA to release income under certain circumstances. Several commentswere received regarding the need for clarification regarding income releases.These comments are addressed in this subpart and also in the appropriatesections of the proposed regulations and the proposed rule has been amendedwhere appropriate.<T3>Section 1924.51_General. </T3>The amendment to this section providesfor the deletion of Recreation (RL) loan program and the deletion of theExhibit A ``New Full-Time Family Farmer and Rancher Development Committee.''No negative comments were received. The Agency adopts the proposed amendment.<T3>Section 1924.56_Credit Counseling.</T3> One respondent commented thatit appears that subsection (b)(2) of this section was misplaced becauseit directed a County Supervisor to advise applicants and borrowers of FmHA'scredit elsewhere requirements. The respondent felt this was not properas eligible applicants should have already proven that they could not getcredit elsewhere. This section provides guidance to the County Supervisorof his/her responsibility to provide credit counseling to applicants andborrowers. Credit counseling is more than advising applicants and borrowersof FmHA's credit elsewhere requirement. It is a means of providing theapplicant/borrower with information about other credit sources that areavailable and how these credit sources can be utilized, along with FmHA'sfunds, to best meet the objectives of both the applicant and/or borrowerand FmHA. Many times the borrower is able to obtain credit from other sourceswith the assistance of FmHA's credit counseling which helps the borrowerto increase his/her financial knowledge, thus resulting in an informedapplicant/borrower who can take advantage of other credit that is available.The Agency has amended subsection (b)(2) of this section by deleting theterm borrower as all persons who are eligible applicants can be a borroweror a new applicant. The Agency adopts the proposed rule as amended.<T3>Section 1924.57_Planning. </T3>One respondent requested that FmHA includea statement in this section that FmHA may not use the Coordinated FinancialStatement (CFS) form without first obtaining the farmer's written permission.The Agency is prohibited by section 1325 of the Food Security Act of 1985(Pub. L. 99-198) from using the CFS and so does not need this change tothe proposed rule. However, we did add a statement prohibiting its use.One respondent felt that the statement ``These two forms will cover the12-month period (or crop year) which most accurately reflects the annualproduction cycle of the operation'' was not flexible enough to allow anyflexibility for those operators which might require a plan for a shorteror longer period of time. The Agency agrees and has revised the proposedrule to allow the plan to cover the production cycle.One respondent suggested that if a livestock borrower is current with his/herpayments and in good standing with FmHA that Form FmHA 431-2, ``Farm andHome Plan,'' not be filled out as it would reduce the workload in the CountyOffice. This section relates to the completion of an annual plan of operationand Form FmHA 1962-1, ``Agreement for the Use of Proceeds/Release of ChattelSecurity,'' which we believe the respondent is referring to instead ofForm FmHA 431-2. Form FmHA 1962-1 is required for all borrowers with FmHAloans secured by chattels. The completion of Form FmHA 1962-1 is essential,especially for livestock operators, as it is the means that allows FmHAand the borrower to reach an understanding as to the use and release ofchattel security.Several respondents were concerned that County Supervisors were not providedwith proper guidance on how to develop ``Key Management Practices'' andthat once these practices were developed that a list should be providedthe borrower and those practices which the borrower has not incorporatedinto the operation will be incorporated in Schedule D of the borrower'sFarm and Home Plan. The Agency agrees and has amended this section to provideguidance to the County Supervisor in developing ``Key Management Practices.''The guidance provides an example of whom the County Supervisor should consultin developing these practices. Those key practices upon which the borrowerand the County Supervisor agree, will be documented in Schedule D of theFarm and Home Plan. The proposed amendment is adopted as changed. Several respondents commented that the wording regarding plans developedby agencies and organizations outside of FmHA was vague and the final ruleshould be more specific as to clearly detail the weight given and the effectthe various plans might have on the operation. The Agency agrees and hasclarified this section to specify those outside agencies from which anapplicant can request assistance and that any outside plans developed,which are applicable to the applicant's operation, will be used. If theplan is not feasible then the County Supervisor will document the reasonswhy in the borrower's case file. The proposed rule is adopted as amended.There were several respondents who took issue with the proposed definitionof a feasible plan. Their major concerns were that not all farming operationshave an equal degree of risk and it was not proper to impose an equal reservefor risk for all types of operations and that it was arbitrary and capriciousto require that all borrowers live at an ``average'' standard of living.The Agency agrees and has amended this section to define a feasible planas a plan based upon actual production and expense records which will payall operating expenses, meet necessary payments on all debts and providea living expense which is in accordance with the family's essential need.The proposed rule is adopted as amended.Several respondents were concerned about the requirement in this sectionwhich stated ``when an accurate projection cannot be made because the applicant'sproduction history has been affected by a disaster(s) declared by the Presidentor designated by the Secretary of Agriculture, County average yields willbe used for the disaster year(s).'' Their concern was that for those borrowerswho were not in a declared disaster area but had a disaster that wouldhave qualified them if the area had been declared as a disaster area.The Agency agrees and has revised the proposed amendment to allow thosefarmers who have had a qualifying loss and were not located in a designated/declaredarea to use county average yields for the disaster year(s). The proposedrule is adopted as amended.There were several respondents who took exception to the establishmentof unit prices by basing the prices exclusively on the past 12 month'sprices. If a disaster has occurred during the 12-month period this periodwould not be a good prediction of future prices as it would reflect theincrease in prices due to a shortage of supply. The Agency has revisedthis section to allow the State Director to consult with State Directorsadjoining the State and other knowledgeable agricultural representativesand lenders in establishing commodity prices. These borrowers who haveproven accurate records to support a premium price or contracts with wellestablished markets will be allowed to use these prices. The proposed ruleis adopted as changed.One respondent was concerned that while an appeal is pending and the borrower'srequest for releases were in excess of what would be average for the areathat even if the borrower documented the reasons for the release, the regulationsdo not clarify if FmHA will allow the additional release or how FmHA makesthe decision. To clarify this section FmHA has amended this section toprovide for additional releases when the borrower has documented and justifiedthe need for them. The documentation, by the borrower, will be the meanswhere by FmHA will be able to make the decision as to the justificationof the release. The Agency adopts the proposed amendment as changed.Section 1924.58_<T3>Recordkeeping. </T3>Several comments were received regarding the keepingand maintaining of records, and the responsibilities of the County Supervisorin assisting the borrower in recordkeeping. It was also requested thatthe word adequate be defined. The Agency has amended the proposed amendmentto require the borrower to maintain a recordkeeping system which will providea monthly cash flow, a change in financial position, beginning and endof year balance sheets, and an income statement. It will be the responsibilityof the County Supervisor to determine that the borrower's recordkeepingsystem meets the above conditions. It is also the County Supervisor's responsibilityto assist those borrowers who are unable to maintain a recordkeeping system.The proposed amendment is adopted as changed.<T3>Section 1924.60_Analysis. </T3>One respondent commented that this sectionon analysis should be clarified as to the conducting of an annual analysisfor borrowers who have had their debts restructured. The Agency agreesand has amended this section to clarify for what purposes and when an analysiswill be conducted, and how the information that the analysis develops willbe utilized. The proposed amendment is adopted as changed.<T3>Section 1924.71_Delinquent borrower. </T3>This section has been amendedto clarify that ``Status Report of Farmer Programs Accounts, 540'' willbe sent monthly to each FmHA County Office. No negative comments were receivedregarding the servicing of these delinquent accounts as proposed in SubpartS of Part 1951 of this chapter. The Agency adopts the proposed amendmentas changed.<T3>Exhibit A to Subpart B. </T3>Several respondents commented regardingthe need for clarification as to release of essential family and operationexpenses and the need for a chart to assist the borrower in knowing whatitems would require prior approval regarding Form FmHA 1962-1 ``Agreementfor the Use of Proceeds/Release of Chattel Security.'' The Agency agreesand has amended Exhibit A to clarify the reasons for the form and how itis to be utilized by both the borrower and FmHA. A chart has also beendeveloped which will provide guidance to both the borrower and FmHA asto those items which will need prior consent before the borrower can proceedwith the action. The Agency adopts the proposed rule as amended.There were other respondents who requested minor changes as to the furtherdefinition of records and clarification of phases which the Agency hasadopted and has amended this section to reflect these changes. Otherwise,the proposed rule is adopted as proposed.<ITAG tagnum="81">PART 1941_OPERATING LOANS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart A_Operating Loan Policies, Procedures, and Authorizations</ITAG>This subpart provides procedures for receiving and processing insured operatingloans, and was revised to incorporate section 602 ``definitions'' of theAgricultural Credit Act of 1987. This section provided for a classificationof the term borrower. No negative comments were received and the proposedrule was adopted. Section 603, ``Security for FmHA Real Estate Loans,''of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 permits a borrower to use the samereal estate collateral to secure two or more loans made, insured or guaranteedunder this subtitle. The outstanding amount of such loans may not exceedthe total value of the collateral. No negative comments were received andthe proposed rule was adopted with other minor additions, in the interimrule.<T3>Section 1941.2_Objectives. </T3>One respondent commented that thissection should be clarified regarding the making of youth loans. The concernwas that the present regulation implies that loans to youth can be madeto assist them to be family-sized farm operators. The Agency agrees thatCONACT section 311(b)(1) provides that loans may be made to youths whoare rural residents to enable them to operate enterprises in connectionwith their participation in 4-H Clubs, Future Farmers of America and similarorganizations. The Agency believes that the CONACT specifically statesthat the youth loan program is to assist rural youth in establishing income-producingprojects under the guidance of a 4-H Club. The Agency agrees and adoptsthe proposed rule as changed.<T3>Section 1941.4_Definitions. </T3>Several respondents commented on thefeasibility definition. The Agency has incorporated clarification changes,along with other minor changes in language, and additions, in the interimrule.One respondent stated the definition of ``Limited Resource Applicant''refers to Exhibit B which has expired. The Agency agrees with this commentand has deleted the reference to Exhibit B and adopts the proposed ruleas amended.<T3>Section 1941.6_Credit elsewhere. </T3>Several respondents stated thatthe credit elsewhere decision should be a County Committee decision nota County Supervisor's decision, and that the proposed rule was not consistentwith Subpart A of Part 1910 of this chapter. Subpart A of Part 1910 ofthis chapter requires that the County Supervisor verify and document thatadequate credit is not available before a loan is approved.While the County Committee is responsible for the determination of eligibility,it is the County Supervisor's responsibility to verify the credit needsand the availability of other credit to the applicant. The County Committeemakes the decision regarding the borrower's ability to obtain other creditassistance. The Agency has amended this section to require the County Supervisorto document the availability of adequate credit along with other minorchanges and additions in the interim rule.One respondent commented that borrowers should not be asked to obtain highercost guaranteed loans. FmHA borrowers are encouraged to supplement operatingloans with credit from other credit sources to the extent economicallyfeasible and in accordance with sound financial management procedures.The guaranteed interest rate reduction program allows the lenders to reducethe interest rate to borrowers in order to develop a feasible plan. TheAgency has determined that borrowers are not eligible for an insured loanas long as the guaranteed loan is feasible.<T3>Section 1941.12 Eligibility requirements. </T3>Several respondentscommented that the eligibility requirement for training or farming experiencewithin one of the past five years is unreasonable. The Agency has amendedthe proposed rule to provide that educational or on-the-job training, withinone of the past five years, may be considered adequate experience. TheAgency adopts the proposed rule as amended.Several respondents commented that if a person has a history of delinquencyfor reasons beyond his/her control but had made an honest effort to meethis/her obligations that this factor should be considered as a favorablecharacter trait. The Agency agrees and has incorporated the change in theinterim rule.<T3>Section 1941.16_Loan purposes. </T3>One respondent commented that theOL limitations of $7,500 that could be loaned in a fiscal year for realestate improvements or repairs was not realistic. The Agency agrees andhas amended this section to increase the loan limit to $15,000. The Agencyadopts the proposed rule as amended.<T3>Section 1941.17_Loan limitations. </T3>Several respondents commentedthat this section should be clarified by stating that the applicant's principalloan balance may not exceed the loan limit for the program. The Agencyagrees and has amended this section to state that the total outstandingprincipal loan balance, including the new loan owed by the applicant, maynot exceed the loan limit.One respondent stated that the reference regarding the Memorandum of Understandingbetween FmHA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service should be includedin this section to insure that all parties involved would know of the assistancethat the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service could provide. The Agency agreesand has incorporated this comment in the interim final rule.<T3>Section 1941.18_Rates and terms. </T3>Several respondents commentedthat the regulations should be changed to state that, ``The interest ratefor the loan will be the interest rate in effect at the time of the loanapproval or loan closing, whichever is lower.'' The statutory languageof the CONACT permits only the lower rate to be used where the applicantrequest that the lower rate be used. The Agency adopts the proposed rule,along with other minor changes in the interim final rule.<T3>Section 1941.19_Security. </T3>This section provides that a borroweris not required to use separate and identifiable collateral to secure twoor more loans made, insured or guaranteed, provided the outstanding amountof such loans does not exceed the total value of the collateral used. Section603, Security for FmHA Real Estate Loans of the 1987 Farm Bill, statesthat a borrower may use the same collateral to secure two or more loansmade, insured or guaranteed. This subtitle deals only with real estate.One commentor stated that applying this requirement to chattel loan securitywould complicate loan servicing and liquidation if the borrower had bothreal estate and chattel loans secured by the same chattel security, andshould be prohibited. The Agency agrees and incorporates the change alongwith minor changes in language and addition in the interim final rule.One respondent commented that FmHA does not allow borrowers to obtain asubordination for amounts advanced for annual operating and living expensesfor the crop year. The Agency has clarified this section to allow subordinations.One respondent expressed concern that FmHA was making unsecured loans andthat this practice should be prohibited. FmHA agrees and has amended thissection to provide that the security pledged for loans must be adequateto assure repayment of the loan and other minor changes in language andadditions, in the interim final rule.<T3>Section 1941.25_Appraisals. </T3>Several respondents commented thatFmHA should complete an appraisal for all loans regardless of the loansize and establish qualifications for FmHA appraisers. Currently appraisalsare not required when a chattel debt is being refinanced for under $5,000and for real estate when the security needed is less than $10,000. TheAgency agrees and has amended this section to require an appraisal wheneveran initial loan is made and has established qualifications for contractappraisers in the interim final rule.<T3>Section 1941.29_Relationship between FmHA loans, insured and guaranteed.</T3>Several respondents commented that the relationship between FmHA loans,insured and guaranteed, should be clarified. The Agency agrees and hasclarified this section by including an example which will explain or demonstratethe relationship between the two programs in the interim final rule.<T3>Section 1941.33_Loan approval or disapproval. </T3>One respondent commentedthat the loan principal balance could not exceed the guaranteed OL limitof $400,000. This section deals directly with insured operating loans onlyand the limitation of guaranteed OL is found in andSection; 1941.29. TheAgency adopts the proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_Closing Loans Secured by Chattels</ITAG>This subpart provides the procedures for closing operating loans securedby chattels. It was revised in part to incorporate comments received onthe proposed rule.<T3>Section 1941.54_Promissory note. </T3>One respondent commented thatFmHA should provide explicit guidance regarding when cosigners are required.The Agency agrees and has clarified this in the interim final rule.<T3>Section 1941.88_Insurance. </T3>Several respondents commented thatcrop insurance should be a loan requirement for crop loans and one commentorstated that it was not necessary for the County Office to maintain a recordon Form FmHA 1905-12, ``Monthly Expirations,'' of the date on which a borrower'scrop insurance premium is due. The Agency believes that the decision topurchase crop insurance is a key management decision that should be leftup to the County Supervisor and the borrower and not an absolute requirementfor loan assistance. The Agency has deleted the requirement that the CountyOffice maintain the monthly expiration card for crop insurance premiumsonly. The Agency adopts the proposed rule as amended.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1943_FARM OWNERSHIP, SOIL AND WATER AND RECREATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_Insured Farm Ownership Loan Policies, Procedures and Authorizations</ITAG>This subpart provides the procedures for receiving and processing of insuredfarm ownership loans. This subpart was revised in part to incorporate section603, ``Security for FmHA Real Estate Loans,'' which provides for the borrowerto use the same real estate collateral to secure two or more loans made,insured, or guaranteed under this subtitle, except that the outstandingamount of such loans may not exceed the total value of the collateral.No negative comments were received and the proposed rule was adopted. Thissubpart was also revised to incorporate section 617, ``Target ParticipationRates,'' and section 623, ``Farm Ownership Outreach Program to SociallyDisadvantaged Individuals.'' These sections provide for a farm ownershipoutreach program for persons who are members of any group with respectto which an individual may be identified as a socially disadvantaged individualto encourage the acquisition of inventory farmland of FmHA and to establishtarget participation rates, on a county-wide basis, to insure that sociallydisadvantaged groups will receive farm ownership loans and the opportunityto purchase or lease FmHA's inventory farmland. Several comments were receivedregarding these sections. These comments are addressed in the appropriatesections of the regulations.<T3>Section 1943.4_Definitions. </T3>Several respondents, primarily specialinterest groups, commented that the definition for a socially disadvantagedapplicant should be changed to meet the requirements of section 617 ofthe Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. The Agency adopts this suggestionin the interim rule.One respondent suggested that ``undivided interest'' be included in thissection. The Agency adopts this suggestion in the interim rule.There were several respondents who took issue with the proposed definitionof ``Feasible plan.'' Their major concerns were that not all farming operationshave equal degrees of risk and it was not proper to impose an equal reservefor risk for all types of operations, and that it was arbitrary and capriciousto require that all borrowers live at an ``average'' standard of living.The Agency agrees and has amended this section to define a feasible planas a plan based upon actual production and expense records which will payall operating expenses, meet necessary payments on all debts, and provideliving expenses which are in accordance with the family essential needs.The proposed rule is adopted as amended.<T3>Section 1943.6_Credit elsewhere. </T3>One respondent suggested thatcredit elsewhere is a County Committee, rather than a County Supervisor,determination.While it is the county committee's responsibility to determine eligibilityof the availability of other credit, it is the County Supervisor's responsibilityto verify the credit needs and the availability of other credit to theapplicant. This information must be presented to the County Committee sothey can make a factual decision regarding credit availability. The Agencyhas amended this section to require the County Supervisor to document theavailability of adequate credit and has deleted paragraphs (a) and (b)of this section as they are adequately addressed in this section.<T3>Section 1943.10_Preference. </T3>Several respondents suggested thatfarm ownership loans funds be designated for applicants who are membersof socially disadvantaged groups to be used exlusively to assist them inachieving FO loan purposes, as outlined in andSection; 1943.16 of this subpart.This requirement does not prohibit states from using their regular FO allocationto assist socially disadvantaged applicants. The Agency adopts this suggestion.<T3>Section 1943.12_Eligibility requirement. </T3>Several respondents wereconcerned about the requirement that training or farm experience withinone of the last five years is unrealistic. The Agency argues that a personwho has been away from farming for a long period of time has lost all conceptof the financial and production management requirements that are requiredin today's farming to insure a reasonable chance of success. The Agencyhas amended the proposed rule to provide that educational or on-the-jobtraining within one of the past five years will suffice for experience.The Agency adopts the proposed rule as amended.One respondent suggested that andSection; 1943.12 (a)(4) and (b)(4)(iii)clarify <T3>character, </T3>regarding debt repayment, and whether the applicanthas tried to pay his or her loans. The Agency has adopted the suggestion.One respondent suggested that a person who has substantial farm trainingor experience, but who did not farm for the past five years, could havethe farming ability to assure reasonable prospect of success. As mentionedabove the management of a farm has changed considerably in the past fewyears and recent experience is necessary if one wants to have a reasonablechance of success. The Agency has amended this section to clarify thateducation or on-the-job training within one of the past five years willsuffice for experience, which will assure those that have been out of farmingfor a long period of time at least has a basic knowledge of current agriculturaltrends. The Agency adopts this rule as amended.<T3>Section 1943.13_Outreach program for members of socially disadvantagedgroups. </T3>Several comments were received which suggested that StateDirectors establish an advisory committee with individuals of organizationsworking directly with farmers on the local level in order to ensure thesuccessful implementation of the socially disadvantaged program. The Agency has charged Farmer Program Chiefs, who are familiar with thefarm ownership (FO) program, to initiate this program. The National Officewill provide each State with the county target participation rates. TheCounty Committee will continue to be responsible for establishing eligibilityand County Supervisors will have loan approval authority. The Agency doesnot feel that the formulation of advisory committees would be beneficialin carrying out the intent of the law. Thus, the Agency does not adoptthis suggestion. <T3>Section 1943.16_Loan purposes._Paragraph (b)(1). </T3>One respondentsuggested that technical assistance be defined. The Agency finds no needto define technical assistance and deletes the term from the referencedsection. <T3>Paragraph (b)(6)(ii). </T3>One respondent suggested that ``patronized''was a typographical error. The Agency decided that ``used'' was a betterword. <T3>Paragraph (c)(1). </T3>One respondent suggested that undivided interestbe defined. The Agency adopted the suggestion by adding a definition toandSection; 1943.4 of this subpart. <T3>Section 1943.17_Loan limitations. </T3>One respondent suggested thatandSection; 1943.17(a)(1) be rewritten to make it clear that the applicant'sprincipal balance cannot exceed $200,000 and, if there is a cosigner, thecosigner's principal balance may not exceed $200,000. It should be madeclear that the applicant and the cosigner are not limited to a combinedprincipal balance of $200,000. The Agency has revised this paragraph to accommodate the suggested change.<T3>Section 1943.18_Rates and terms. </T3>One respondent suggested thatandSection; 1943.18(c) should be changed to reflect that any borrower whois given a choice between two interest rates will obviously choose thelower rate. 7 U.S.C. 1927a, Loan Programs, stipulates that effective November 12, 1983,and thereafter, upon request of the borrower, the interest rate chargedby the Farmers Home Administration to housing, farm, water and waste disposal,and community facility borrowers shall be the lower of the rates in effectat either the time of loan approval or loan closing. Thus, the Agency cannotchange this language of the proposed rule. <T3>Section 1943.23_General provisions. </T3>One respondent suggested thatreference to the Memorandum of Understanding between FmHA and the U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service andSection; 1943.23(c) be referenced here and alsobe updated to reflect the latest changes. The Agency will be updating theEnvironmental Regulation in the very near future to incorporate this requirement.The Agency has adopted the suggestion of the reference and has incorporatedthis change to the proposed rule. <T3>Section 1943.24_Special requirements. </T3>One respondent suggestedthat andSection; 1943.24(b)(1)(i) should be changed to read: ``A real estatelien will be taken on such dwelling, if necessary, to adequately securethe loan. The Agency does not adopt this suggestion. There may be equity in suchproperty to further secure the interest of the Government. <T3>Section 1943.25_Options, planning and appraisals. </T3>Several respondentscommented on the need for an appraisal, no matter how small the loan requestis, and the need to establish guidance as to the qualifications of theappraiser. Currently, real estate appraisals are not required when theamount of the loan is less than $10,000. The Agency agrees and has amendedthis section to require an appraisal whenever real estate is taken as security.The Agency has also clarified this section by including contractors whohave been authorized to make farm appraisals and established criteria bywhich the County Supervisor will determine the qualifications of thesecontractors. The Agency adopted these changes to the proposed rule. <T3>Section 1943.29_Relationship with other FmHA loans, insured and guaranteed.</T3>One respondent suggested that this andSection; 1943.29(b)(1) be rewrittento make it clear that the applicant's principal balance cannot exceed $300,000and, if there is a cosigner, the cosigner's principal balance may not exceed$300,000. It should be made clear that the applicant and the cosigner arenot limited to a combined principal balance of $300,000. The Agency has rewritten this section to make it clear that the total insuredand guaranteed FO, SW and RL principal balance, including the new loan,owed by the applicant does not exceed $300,000 at loan closing. All referencesto cosigner have been removed from this paragraph. The Agency adopts theproposed amendment as changed. <T3>Section 1943.38_Loan closing actions. </T3>One respondent suggestedthat andSection; 1943.38(h) be eliminated regarding supplementary paymentagreements. The Agency feels that supplementary payment agreements are an essentialcollection tool for farm ownership loans when borrowers depend primarilyupon off-farm income to make farm payments. The Agency does not adopt thissuggestion. <T3>Section 1943.43_Subsequent FO loans. </T3>Several respondents commentedthat an appraisal should be considered whenever real estate is taken assecurity. The present regulations state that a real estate appraisal wouldonly be required when real estate is taken as security and certain conditionsexisted. The Agency agrees and has amended this section to require an appraisalwhenever real estate is taken as security. This change will be in linewith the requirement in andSection; 1943.25 of this subpart. The Agency adoptsthe proposed amendment as changed. <T3>Exhibit B to Subpart A_Target Participation Rates for Farmers HomeAdministration Loans for Socially Disadvantaged Applicants. </T3>Two respondentscommented that the Target Participation Rates are calculated incorrectly.The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 mandates that direct FO loan fundsfor members of socially disadvantaged groups be targeted on a county basis.However, the existing allocation formula precludes such a distributionof funds. There is insufficient allocation to ensure that at least oneloan could be made in each county with members of socially disadvantagedgroups. Funds will be allocated to States based on the rural minority population,with available funds targeted to counties with the largest rural sociallydisadvantaged population. Since no comments were received on other areas of the proposed rule ofthis subpart, the proposed rule is adopted as published, except for minornecessary clarification and editorial changes. <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1943</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B </ITAG>This subpart provides guidance for the making of Insured Soil and WaterLoans. <T3>Section 1943.54_Definitions. </T3>There were several respondents whocommented on the proposed feasibility definition. The comments were thesame as those addressed in Part 1943, Subpart A, andSection; 1943.4. Pleaserefer to this section in the Agency's response. <T3>Section 1943.62_Soil and water loan eligibility requirements.</T3>Several respondents commented that the regulations should be clarifiedthat character regarding debt repayment should focus on whether or notthe applicant has tried to pay his/her loans. They suggested that if aperson has a history of delinquency for reasons beyond his/her controland had made a honest effort to meet the obligations that this factor shouldstill meet the good character requirements. The Agency agrees and has adoptedthe proposed rule as amended.<T3>Section 1943.68_Rates and terms.</T3> Several of the respondents commentedthat the regulations should be changed to state that ``The interest ratefor the loan will be the interest rate in effect at the time of the loanapproval or loan closing, whichever is lower.'' This requirement is setforth in the CONACT in (7 U.S.C. 1927a) Loan Programs. Thus, the Agencycannot change this language of the proposed rule.<T3>Section 1943.75_Options, planning and appraisals.</T3> Several respondentscommented on the need for an appraisal no matter how small the loan requestis and the need to establish guidance as to the qualifications of the appraiser.Currently, real estate appraisals are not required when the amount of theloan is less than $10,000. The Agency agrees and has amended this sectionto require an appraisal whenever real estate is taken as security. TheAgency has also clarified this section by including contractors, who havebeen authorized, to make farm appraisals and established criteria by whichthe County Supervisor will determine the qualifications of these contractors.<T3>Section 1943.77_Relationship with other FmHA loans, insured and guaranteed.</T3>Several respondents commented that the relationship between FmHA loans,insured and guaranteed should be clarified.

The Agency adopted these changes to the proposedrule.<T3>Section 1943.93_Subsequent SW loans.</T3> Several respondents commentedthat an appraisal should be considered whenever real estate is taken assecurity. The present regulations state that a real estate appraisal wouldonly be required when real estate is taken as security and certain conditionsexisted.

However, in view of comments made on other regulations,these paragraphs were revised to follow the procedures Subpart A of Part1955 of this chapter without exception. <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart S_Farmers Program Account Servicing Policies</ITAG>The proposed rule added this regulation. Previously, the major FmHA FPloan servicing programs were dispersed throughout various regulations.The recodified regulations combines the existing loan servicing programsas modified and include the significant loan servicing requirements ofthe Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 (ACT). This will make it easier forthe FmHA field staff and borrowers to read and interpret the Farmer ProgramServicing regulations.This subpart was the major area of discussion of many of the comments.The following appear to be the most significant points addressed by therespondents: Procedures for timely consideration of Preservation Loan Service Programs;shared appreciation agreements and the request for additional collateralin Primary Loan Servicing Program considerations; debt restructuring noticesto accelerated borrowers who did not respond to the ``Notice of Right toRequest Income Release;'' proposed regulatory provisions that were interpretedto prohibit reconsideration of Primary Loan Service Programs if a borrowerbecomes delinquent on a previously serviced loan; the definition of ``circumstancesbeyond the borrower's control;'' the definition of ``good faith;'' recoveryvalue calculations; readability of FmHA notices; contents of DALR$ computerprogram and printout; and what constitutes a feasible plan. These points are discussed in accordance with the applicable Section ofthe Subpart. <T3>Section 1951.901_Purpose.</T3> This section describes the policiesand procedures that Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) will follow in servicingmost Farmer Program loans. Examples of loan servicing actions that FmHAmay take are: consolidation, rescheduling and/or reamortization, deferralof principal and interest payments, (including Softwood Timber (ST) loans)and reduced interest rates, write down of debt (including ConservationEasements), or any combination of these actions. These actions are referredto as Primary Loan Service Programs. This Subpart also includes PreservationLoan Service Programs, stated as Homestead Protection and Leaseback/Buybackand are set forth in specific Sections in this Subpart. Several respondents were not in favor of the debt restructuring with writedown. These respondents stated various reasons why FmHA should not writedown FmHA Farmer Program borrowers' delinquent loans and continue withthem under the regular loan programs. Generally, these respondents feltthat the legislation was not fair to the many FmHA borrowers who have madesacrificies to keep their loans current. Several of the respondents referredto the write down as ``bail out legislation'' for poor farm operators.One respondent stated that ``our troubled farmers have caused their ownproblems that they are in today.'' One respondent stated ``it seems thatour Government is confused as to just what it wants to do. On one hand,they are spending billions of dollars trying to reduce the agriculturalsurplus and on the other hand, they are spending billions trying to keepfarmers in business and producing that shouldn't be there anyway.'' One FmHA farmer program borrower wrote ``I feel this is most unfair andfeel that I also, because I am a good farmer and did not live beyond mymeans, should be given the same rights and privileges. So, at this time,I am suspending payments to FmHA until it is explained to my satisfactionwhy I should not be given these same privileges.'' Several respondents wrote in favor of the proposed restructuring of FmHAfarmer program loans with write down and preservation loan service programs.One respondent wrote ``loan assistance from FmHA in the form of a writedown of existing debt, making it possible to modernize the plant and equipmentto state-of-the-art would assure the long term existence of (name of respondent)and payout of the FmHA-backed bank loan.'' Another respondent writes, ``Ihave advocated the implementation of a forgiveness clause for several yearsto assist those deserving farmers who, by no fault of their own, have losteverything they owned farming.'' Many form letter type responses were receivedfrom the public supporting the restructuring with write down of FmHA farmdebt stating, ``Congress passed the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 tohelp family farmers save their farms. It is now up to FmHA to make surethat the debt restructuring and other programs that Congress gave FmHAthe authority to use will help farmers save their farms.'' The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 (ACT) provides for substantial revisionin FmHA farmer program loan servicing. The loan restructuring provisionsof the Act provide for a write down of delinquent debt to the net recoveryvalue of collateral when the return to the Government under the restructureddebt is at least as great as the return from involuntary liquidation. One respondent noted that andSection;1951.901 should be amended to clarifythat just because the Farmers Home Administration may have made an improperdecision in granting a farmer a loan, it should not be considered unauthorizedor a nonprogram loan for purpose of loan servicing. The Agency agrees that if FmHA was at fault in issuing a loan, the farmerborrower should be provided with the same rights to loan servicing, appeals,and release of production income as any other farmer program borrower.Section 1951.901 is amended by revising to state that if FmHA or a courtof law determines that FmHA was at fault in issuing a loan, the farmerborrower's FmHA loan account will not be considered unauthorized or a nonprogramloan, for purposes of Primary and Preservation Loan Service Programs. WhenFmHA makes every effort to correct unauthorized assistance, such loansare serviced as authorized loans and therefore may be considered for allservicing options.One respondent stated that in andSection; 1951.901, examples of loan servicingactions that FmHA may take should specifically state ``Conservation Set-Aside.''The ``Conservation Easement Program'' is a form of write down of a distressedFmHA farmer program loan just as the softwood timber loan program is aform of deferral. This has been clarified in andSection; 1951.901.<T3>Section 1951.902._Policy. </T3>Any FmHA farmer program borrower mayrequest Primary or Preservation Loan Service Programs in this subpart atany time. The borrowers must be unable to pay their debt as scheduled beforeFmHA will use Primary or Preservation Loan Service Programs. The borrower'saccount must be managed with an overall objective of keeping the farmerin business while at the same time minimizing loses to the Government.One respondent stated that the time required to thoroughly analyze eachwrite down candidate was unrealistic. The timeframe should be 6 monthsor more.The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 requires FmHA to make the determinationand notify the borrower in writing, of the results, within 60 days afterreceipt of a written request for restructuring.Several respondents stated that since FmHA has the authority to enter intoPreservation Loan Service Program agreements prior to actual liquidationand foreclosure, that all borrowers who respond to the ``Notice of theAvailability of Loan Service Programs'' should be automatically consideredfor Homestead Protection and Leaseback/Buyback. The Agency agrees thatall borrowers who respond to the ``Notice of Availability of Loan ServicePrograms'' should be considered for Preservation Loan Service Programsif the borrower's debts cannot be restructured. This section is clarifiedto state that FmHA may enter into Homestead Protection and Leaseback/BuybackAgreements prior to any acceleration of liquidation actions.Several respondents stated that, in the Phase I referred to in this section,it was not clear whether the tools of rescheduling and reamortization wouldbe available to all borrowers who are already delinquent on their loansand who will be provided notice of the availability of loan servicing underthe Primary Loan Service Programs. This section is amended to state thatrescheduling and/or reamortization must be used before an account getsbehind schedule as well as used for accounts that are behind schedule.The County Office employees will review farmer program loans annually,prior to the date the annual payment is due, in order to determine whatservicing actions are needed to properly service a borrower's accounts.One respondent suggested that the specific calculation formula containedin the regulation be stated in the discussion of Phase III of this sectionand, the section requiring an appraisal of all collateral, should requirethat the appraisals be in compliance with the standard appraisal provisionsoutlined in the regulation. The Agency agrees with these suggestions andhas amended the rule to incorporate this comment.Phase III of this paragraph stated that when the borrower's debts couldnot be restructured, the borrower is placed in Phase IV and liquidationwill be required.Several respondents pointed out that all delinquent borrowers who are sentthe notice of loan service programs are entitled to apply for HomesteadProtection and Leaseback/Buyback Programs prior to FmHA actually acceleratingthe loans and taking the property into inventory, and that these borrowersmust be advised of and considered for these programs prior to actual accelerationor liquidation. The Agency agrees with this comment and has incorporatedthe change, along with other minor changes in language.Section 1951.902 of the proposed rule indicated that FmHA will use an approvedcomputer program to assist in finding and documenting the loan servicingprogram that will provide the best net recovery to the Government and keepthe farmer on the farm.Several respondents commented that since the ultimate decisions on servicingFmHA loans will be made through the use of this computer program, it isimportant that the computer program be made available to the general public.The respondents pointed out that complete instructions should be made availableto the public for comment as if it were a proposed rule.The Agency has considered this view and has added a separate Exhibit Jto fully explain and provide instructions on how the ``Debt and Loan RestucturingSystem (DALRS)'' is used to assist in finding the loan servicing programsbest suited for a borrower's farming operation. Since this rule will bepublished as an interim rule, the public will have an opportunity to reviewand comment on these new exhibits. However, because of conditions in thefarming community and FmHA's statutory mandate requiring rapid implemetationof these rules, they will take effect as interim rules. This requires thatfinal rules be published after the comment period.<T3>Section 1951.903_Authorities and Responsibilities. </T3>Section 1951.903,paragraph (b), provides that only State Directors are authorized to writedown a borrower's debt.The comments on this section indicated that it would be very difficultand time consuming for one person to be making ultimate decisions on writedown of debt. They suggested the regulations should be outlined in sufficientdetail to ensure that County Office employees are capable of making decisionson write down of debt.The Agency agrees that the regulations should be written in sufficientdetail to ensure that County Office employees can recommend decisions onwrite down of debt. However, the Agency does not agree that the write downbe approved at any level below the State Director. The Agency currentlyhas placed the debt settlement authority at the State Director level andbelieves that write down approval must remain at the State Director's levelfor internal control of the write down process.This section also includes a provision that allows County Supervisors toreschedule debt or reamortize borrowers' debts only once. If further reschedulingor reamortization is necessary, then it must go to the next higher levelof FmHA's supervision. Also, if any further action was needed, it wouldhave to be based on whether the borrower was reducing the principal andmaking all payments on the interest.The comments on this section indicated that these restrictions seemed tobe contrary to the intent of the Agricultural Credit Act. They pointedout that denying these delinquent borrowers an opportunity to rescheduleor reamortize their loans a second time and requiring them to immediatelygo into principal and interest write down or other types of primary loanservicing would simply require the Government to loans more money on theseborrowers' accounts.The Agency agrees with these comments and has incorporated this suggestion.<T3>Section 1951.906_Definitions. </T3>Several respondents, including FmHAfield offices and special interest groups, commented on several of thedefinitions in this section.One respondent stated that the definition of ``delinquent borrower'' shouldbe amended to read ``a borrower who has failed to make all or part of thepayment which is due for 30 or more calendar days after the due date.''This would ensure that borrowers who have attempted to make partial paymentsbut are unable to make their whole payment will be provided the opportunityto use the Primary Loan Service Programs when they first begin to get intotrouble on their loan payments. The Agency agrees and adopts this suggestion.One respondent suggested that the definition of ``farm plan'' should prohibitthe required use of Coordinated Financial Statements without consent ofthe borrower. The Agency agrees and the definition has been amended tostate that FmHA will not require the use Coordinated Financial Statements.A number of respondents commented on the definition of ``feasible plan.''Paragraph (b) of the proposed definition states ``to meet scheduled paymentson all open accounts and on all other debts, some of which may includedelinquent taxes.'' One respondent recommended the definition be amendedto state that if there are outstanding debts to suppliers which would notbe ordinarily placed on a scheduled repayment plan, FmHA and the borrowershould attempt to contact the supplier and work out a reasonable scheduleof payments. This problem should be dealt with in the mediation or voluntarymeeting of creditors process. See andSection; 1951.912 of this subpart.Several respondents objected to a 5 percent reserve requirement in thedefinition of a feasible plan that would allow for ``risk and uncertainties.''The Agency agrees that if a borrower is able to show a feasible plan withoutthis 5 percent reserve, the borrower should not be denied FmHA's services.The 5 percent reserve requirement has been removed.One respondent objected to the requirement that the plan must include anaverage standard of living for the family members, stating that many farmersfor years have been living at a standard below poverty level. The respondentstated that the average family standard of living should not be strictlybased on the average of actual living expenses for farmers over that timeperiod. The Agency agrees and has removed the reference to ``average''standard of living and substituted the wording ``which is in accordancewith the essential family needs,'' along with other minor changes.One respondent recommended that the definition of ``liquidation'' be amendedto clarify that simply the filing of a claim in a bankruptcy action isnot a complete liquidation of the borrower's account. The Agency agreesand adopts this recommendation.One respondent recommended that the definition of ``Primary Loan ServicePrograms'' should be amended to refer to the eligibility criteria for eachof the individual types of primary loan servicing.The Agency has recodified the loan servicing regulations. They were revisedand incorporated in this subpart as indicated above. The proposed ruledid remove obsolete and unfunded loan program regulations. Minor changesin language and additions in the interim rule have been made to clarifythe internal effect of recodification of the regulations. The proposedrule definition of ``Primary Loan Service Programs'' is adopted and isconsistent with the eligibility requirements of the Act.<T3>Section 1951.907_Notice of Loan Service Programs. </T3>This sectionallows FmHA to notify borrowers whose accounts are at least 180 days delinquentof Primary Loan Service and Preservation Loan Service Programs. Paragraph(b) requires FmHA to notify borrowers whose accounts were accelerated betweenNovember 1, 1985, and May 7, 1987. This includes borrowers who did notapply for debt restructuring within 45 days after receiving the FmHA's``Notice of Right to Request Income Release.''Several respondents commented that the notice appeared to deny borrowerswhose accounts have been accelerated, an opportunity to apply for any kindof Primary Loan Servicing or debt restructuring. The rule has been amendedto clarify that all farmer program borrowers whose accounts were acceleratedbut have not been foreclosed or liquidated will be sent Exhibit A withAttachments 1 and 2. Those borrowers who do not respond within 45 daysafter receiving the FmHA notice will then be sent Attachment 7, ``Notificationof Continued Acceleration of Loans, Notice of Borrower's Rights,'' andAttachment 8, ``Response to Notice Informing Me of FmHA's Intent to Continueto Accelerate My Loan.''Several respondents commented that paragraphs (b) and (c) of this sectionshould be clarified to state that the 30-day period for the borrower topay the entire payment, or request voluntary conveyance be amended to state30 days after receipt of the farmer's response to Attachment 7. Otherwise,it is not clear whether the 30 days runs at the same time as the 45 daysin the same section. The Agency agrees and adopts this recommendation,along with minor changes in language. Several respondents recommended that paragraph (e) of this section be clarifiedby stating that the fact that a prior lienholder or a junior lienholderis foreclosing, does not take away the borrower's rights to receive the``Notice of the Availability of Loan Service Programs.'' The Agency agreesand has amended this paragraph to incorporate the change, along with otherminor changes in language. Several respondents suggested that paragraph (f) of this section be amendedto clarify that, after any final FmHA decision that does not result ina resolution of the loan defaults, the account will be accelerated in accordancewith Subpart A of Part 1955 of this chapter. Also, paragraph (g) of thissection and paragraphs (a) and (b) of andSection; 1951.908 were identifiedby the respondents as needing clarification regarding which attachmentsare to be sent and what information is needed to fill out a complete financialstatement and to prepare a Farm and Home Plan. The Agency agrees and hasmade minor changes in language for clarification purposes. Several respondents stated that the proposed regulation be clarified tomake it clear that borrowers notified of Primary Loan Service and PreservationLoan Service Programs be considered for both of these programs prior toacceleration or liquidation. The respondents recommended that FmHA firstconsider the borrower for the Primary Loan Service Program and if not eligibleor the debt cannot be restructured, automatically consider the PreservationLoan Program. If the borrower is found ineligible for either program, appealrights should be given separately for each adverse decision. The Agencyagrees with this comment and has incorporated the change in andSection;andSection;1951.909(i)(2) and 1951.911(a)(1)(i). Two paragraphs designated (c) and (d) have been added. Section (c) coversbankruptcies pending on January 6, 1988, the effective date of the AgriculturalCredit Act of 1987. The Agency has added this paragraph in response toa comment concerning the proposed rule at andSection; 1962.47. The respondentstated that the proposed rule would exclude borrowers who filed bankruptciesaround the effective date of the Act. In accordance with paragraph (c)FmHA will send notices to the attorneys of borrowers whose bankruptcieswere pending on January 6, 1988, whose accounts have not been foreclosedor liquidated. However, as provided in paragraph (d) Chapter 7 borrowers discharged priorto January 6, 1988, but who have not reaffirmed their debt to FmHA, willnot be sent the notices. This paragraph has been added in response to acomment which stated that Chapter 7 discharged borrowers should not besent the notices because they do not have a personal obligation to paytheir debt to FmHA. The Agency agrees with this comment except for borrowerswho have reaffirmed their debt to FmHA. This policy is required by section343 of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act as added by section605 of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 which defines borrowers as,``* * * any farm borrower who has outstanding obligations to the Secretary* * *'' This definition continues FmHA's policy in effect on the date ofthe 1987 Act which provided servicing relief to Chapter 7 discharged borrowersonly if they reaffirms their debt. FmHA informed the attorneys of theseborrowers of this policy when they filed for bankruptcy by sending ExhibitD of Subpart A of Part 1962 of this Chapter (available in any FmHA office).Regarding Chapters 11, 12, or 13 borrowers with confirmed plans on January6, 1988, paragraph (d) states the attorney of these borrowers will be sentthe notices if the borrowers are 180 days delinquent. These borrowers haveobligations to FmHA under their bankruptcy plans. The agency believes section605 of the Act requires that these borrowers be sent the notices. <T3>Section 1951.909_Eligibility. </T3>This section has been re-titledand is set forth in the interim rule as subsection (c) of ``ProcessingPrimary Loan Servicing Requests.'' This section in the proposed rule statesthat a borrower who has applied for the Primary or Preservation Loan ServiceProgram must meet all of the requirements listed. This section as publishedin the proposed rule, sets forth eligibility criteria for PreservationLoan Service Programs and some of the Primary Loan Service Programs. Several respondents commented that there is no justification for requiringthat the delinquency on the FmHA loan accounts be ``due to circumstancesbeyond the borrower's control'', and ``that the borrower must have actedin good faith'' in order to be eligible for the Homestead Protection orLeaseback/Buyback Programs. The statutory provision that sets out the circumstances``beyond the borrower's control'' and ``good faith'' eligibility requirements,relate only to the debt restructuring provisions of the Act. The Agencyagrees with this comment and has incorporated this change by removing thereference to the Preservation Loan Service Programs from the section thatsets forth eligibility for the Primary Servicing Programs. Several respondents commented on the ``circumstances beyond the borrower'scontrol.'' The respondents stated that there is no justification for narrowingthe previous acceptable definition contained in the old deferral regulationsin 7 CFR Part 1951, andSection; 1951.44(b)(1). The Agency agrees with thecomment that the failure to pay real estate taxes and property insurancepremiums when due is not necessarily the fault of the borrower and, therefore,should not be included in the definition of ``good faith.'' The Agencyhas incorporated the change, along with other minor changes in languageand additions. Several respondents objected to FmHA requiring borrowers to give additionalreal estate collateral in order to restructure their loans. The respondentsargue that if FmHA were to go through a forced liquidation, the only collateralthat it would acquire and then liquidate to recover on the loan would bethe collateral that it had at the time of liquidation. The respondentsstate that requiring additional security for the restructuring is in violationof the Congressional intent of the statute. FmHA has reexamined this requirementand believes that the additional collateral may be contrary to Congressionalintent. Accordingly, FmHA has removed this requirement from the interimrule. <T3>Section 1951.910._Primary loan service programs_additional requirements.</T3>This section of the proposed rule has been moved to andSection; 1951.909and andSection; 1951.910 entitled [Reserve]. This section lists all of thetypes of property that can be used to secure a reamortized or rescheduledloan. Several respondents commenting on this section stated that while this sectiondoes not specifically state that FmHA is going to require that the borrowerplace all of his/her property as security when the loan is reschedulingor reamortized, the section implies that FmHA will be asking for additionalsecurity in order for the borrower to obtain rescheduling and reamortization.The respondents state that Congress in no way intended that as a conditionfor any type of servicing or debt restructure, FmHA require that the borrowerprovide additional collateral for the restructured loan. Under FmHA's otherregulations, it is described as an exceptional circumstance under whichchattel will be taken to secure a real estate-type loan and real estatewill be taken to secure a chattel-type loan. The respondents state thatthis should remain the practice. The Agency agrees that FmHA farmer programborrowers should not be required to further secure their loans as a conditionfor restructuring. Paragraph (c)(7)(i) now designated andSection; 1951.909(e)(3)(vii)(A) providesthat recoverable cost items will be added to principal as of the date thenew note is signed. This paragraph also states that ``the County Supervisorwill determine the amount of interest and principal owed on the date thenew note will be signed.'' Several of the respondents commented that ``recoverable cost items'' havenot been defined in the regulation and also, that the section should clarifywhether FmHA intends for the borrower to make a payment of some principaland interest on the date that the loan is deferred. ``Recoverable cost charges,'' as defined in 7 CFR Part 1951, Subpart A,are those which the loan agreement documents say the borrower is primarilyresponsible for paying and, which the Government can charge to the borrower'saccount. The wording has been clarified. The statute does not permit thecapitalization of accrued interest that is not more than 90 days past due.This section is clarified to state that accrued interest not more than90 days past due will be repaid in equal amortized installments duringthe term of the loan consolidated, rescheduled or reamortized, as applicable.Also, revisions have been made to clarify that FmHA does not require apayment of principal and/or interest on the date a loan(s) is deferredunless the borrower is able to make such a payment. Several respondents commented on paragraph (c)(8) of this section whichprovides that a supplemental payment agreement be entered into when theborrower has a substantial increase in income and repayment ability duringthe deferral period. The respondent suggested that this section specifythat when doing the analysis to determine whether there is a substantialincrease in income and repayment ability, that FmHA determine whether thisincrease actually exists by comparing it to the original plan developedin the course of the deferral application and, also to plans developedfor the current operating year to determine that the excess income is notneeded for essential living and operating expenses or scheduled debt repayment.The Agency agrees and has incorporated this suggestion with minor revisionsfor clarification. Also, this paragraph has been revised to state thata borrower may appeal an adverse action regarding the signing of a supplementalpayment agreement. The borrower will be notified of any Primary and PreservationLoan Service Programs and given an opportunity to apply for them, eitherbefore or after an appeal related to a payment agreement. Several respondents commented that the requirements of the highly erodibleand conservation provision of the Food Security Act of 1985 should notbe required of borrowers in order for the borrower to be eligible for debtrestructuring. The Sodbuster/Swampbuster requirements apply to loan making(insured and guaranteed), transfers and assumptions, subordinations andleases and credit sales of inventory property. See Exhibit M of 7 CFR SubpartG of Part 1940. Therefore, the Agency has clarified the proposed rule torequire compliance with the sodbuster/swampbuster rules only when theserequirements apply. One respondent suggested that paragraph (e)(4) be clarified to state thatthe borrower should only have to participate in negotiation with creditorswho do not have sufficient security for their debt and who represent asubstantial portion of the borrowers debt. The Agency adopted this suggestion.Also, paragraph (e)(5) of this section has been clarified as suggestedby this respondent by stating that the remaining debt after restructuringwith the Primary Loan Service Programs can be rescheduled/reamortized ordeferred in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section.<T3>Section 1951.911_Processing write-down requests. </T3>This sectionis now entitled ``Processing Preservation Loan Service Program Request.''This section as published in the proposed rule was entitled ProcessingWrite Down Requests and has been redesignated to andSection; 1951.909. Onerespondent pointed out that paragraph (a)(1)(ii) should be amended to reflectthat all expenses should be based on the average holding period when calculatingthe recovery value of liquidated loan collateral. The Agency adopts thissuggestion in the section redesignated as andSection; 1951.909(f)(1)(ii).Several respondents commented that paragraph (d)(3) of this section shouldbe clarified to indicate that the borrower does not have to exclusivelyappeal the current market appraisal in order to be entitled to the independentappraisal. Also, the respondent suggested that the review officer as wellas the hearing officer review the independent appraisal at each stage ofthe appeal process. The Agency agrees with these comments and has incorporatedthe changes in andSection; 1951.909(i)(3), along with other minor changesto clarify the qualifications of an independent appraiser. Several respondents objected to paragraph (e)(7) of this section that requiresFmHA to take a lien on all real estate owned by the borrower if it is goingto write down debt, even if the borrower had not previously pledged thereal estate as security on the loan. The respondent stated that such actionwill put the borrower in very significant disadvantage in that the borrowerwill have no security in order to obtain operating credit in the future.Also, the respondent stated that Congress did not intend for FmHA to collecton restructured loans by requiring real estate security for write downof chattel loans. The Agency agrees and has removed this paragraph. The Agency has redesignated and clarified the requirements contained inparagraph (f) regarding the processing of net recovery buyout recaptureagreements. These requirements are not contained in andSection; 1951.913of the interim rule. In the proposed rule, Exhibit J set forth the provisions of the Leaseback/BuybackProgram. The Program has been moved from Exhibit J to andSection; 1951.911(a)of this subpart to combine Leaseback/Buyback and Homestead Protection inthe same section of the regulations under the title of ``Preservation LoanService Programs.'' This improves readability, the logical flow and theconformity of the regulations. Several respondents commented that once a borrower responds to the ``Noticeof the Availability of Loan Service Programs,'' that if the applicant isnot determined eligible for Primary Loan Service Programs the applicantshould automatically be considered for Leaseback/Buyback. The Agency agreesand has revised the regulations to require that applicants for PrimaryLoan Service Programs are also considered for Preservation Loan ServicePrograms. These changes have been incorporated in the interim rule. Section I.B states that the Leaseback/Buyback Program will be availableto people whose property was in inventory prior to January 6, 1988, onlyif the former owner/previous operator was not advised of his/her Leaseback/Buybackrights under the previous regulations. Several respondents commented that people whose property was in inventoryprior to January 6, 1988, should have the right to priority considerationfor Leaseback/Buyback. The statutory language specifically requires these individuals whose propertywas in inventory and such property contained a dwelling that they be notifiedof their rights to Homestead Protection regardless of when it was takeninto inventory. The Congress, however, did not specify that those formerowners whose farm property was in inventory prior to January 6, 1988, benotified more than once of their Leaseback/Buyback rights. Those formerowners whose properties were acquired prior to January 6, 1988, were advisedof their rights to lease or purchase the property in accordance with theprovisions established by the Food Security Act of 1985. If they were notadvised of these rights (for example, property acquired shortly beforeJanuary 6, 1988) then they will be accorded rights under this regulation.Therefore, the Agency is not adopting this comment.Section I.C.9 of Exhibit J of Subpart S of the proposed rule states thatthe previous operator is the operator who was leasing the farm at the timethe property was taken into inventory.Several respondents recommended that priority consideration should be givento an operator who has been leasing the land from FmHA and who was notthe operator at the time FmHA took the land into inventory.The statutory language for Leaseback/Buyback does not permit priority considerationbe given to operators who leased the property from FmHA. Section 335(e)(1)(c)(iii),as added by Section 611 of the Agricultural Credit Act, requires that priorityconsideration be given to the ``immediate previous family-size farm operatorof such acquired property.'' Those operators that lease property from FmHAwill have equal opportunity to lease or purchase the property when it becomesavailable to lease a sale to all eligible operators. The Agency did notadopt this comment.Section I.C.II through II.B.2. of Exhibit J of Subpart S defines suitableinventory property for which FmHA can make a loan and sets forth the appropriatenotice to be sent to borrowers prior to FmHA taking property into inventory;and circumstances under which FmHA may be able to finance the purchaseof the property through a credit sale.Several respondents suggested these sections should be clarified to statethat all property that is in inventory would fall within the types of propertyfor which FmHA could make a loan and would be classified as suitable. TheAgency has revised the definition of suitable property to include all farmlandproperties that can be used for general farming purposes irregardless ofsize and, also, to state that an owner will be notified of the Leaseback/BuybackPrograms prior to FmHA's acquiring title.Section II.A.2. of Exhibit J, now andSection; 1951.911(a) of Subpart S, requiresFmHA to insert specific provisions into a conditional credit sale contractwith the buyer. These provisions state that FmHA's obligations are contingenton the owners meeting FmHA's credit sale criteria for creditworthinessand repayment ability at the time the credit sale is ready to close.Several respondents commented that this section should be amended to permitclosing of the credit sale at the same time as the borrower signs overthe title to the property to FmHA when the owner is agreeing to voluntarilyconvey property in exchange for the buyback. The Agency agrees with thiscomment and has incorporated the change in the interim rule. Because ofthe possibility that FmHA could acquire the property by being a successfulbidder at a prior lienholder's foreclosure sale, the provisions for a non-simultaneousconveyance and leaseback/buyback have been retained. Section II.B.3 of Exhibit J, now andSection; 1951(a) of Subpart S, statesthat when the borrower is agreeing to pay in cash, the County Supervisorwill enter into the ``Standard Sales Contract,'' with contingences.One respondent recommended that the contingencies of the sale contractbe published in proposed form in order to obtain public comment beforefinal rules are issued. The contingency was inadvertently not publishedin the proposed rule and the Agency has incorporated the contingency inthe interim rule. The contingency is that FmHA must acquire title within2 years. Comments will be received for a 60-day period during the interimperiod and will be considered before final rules are issued.Section III.A. of Exhibit J, now andSection; 1951.911(a) of Subpart S, providesfor a notice to be sent to borrowers whose property has been acquired byFmHA advising them of the availability of the Leaseback/Buyback Program.One respondent commented that borrowers should be given a specific dateby which they must respond to the notice advising them of the availabilityof the Leaseback/Buyback Programs. The Agency has revised its rules toprovide that the former owner has 180 days to make application to enterinto a lease or purchase agreement. These changes have been incorporatedinto the interim rule.Section III.B. of Exhibit J, now andSection; 1951.911(a) of Subpart S, statesthat the spouse, child, or entity members exercising his/her priority rightto Leaseback/Buyback must notify FmHA of their intent to request Leaseback/Buybackwithin 190 days of FmHA acquiring the property.Several respondents commented that FmHA should notify the borrower of thedate upon which the application should be submitted in order to give FmHAsufficient time to consider the application and to enter into a lease orpurchase agreement with them. The Agency agrees and has revised the regulationby requiring that an application for the spouse, children or entity membermust be filed within the 190 day timeframe and has removed the 190 daytimeframe for entering into a lease purchase agreement. These changes havebeen incorporated into the rule.Section III.C. Exhibit J, now andSection; 1951.911(a) of Subpart S, givesthe previous operator 30 days from the date he/she is notified about Leaseback/Buybackto enter into a lease or standard sales contract.One respondent suggested that the 30-day period be extended to 60 days.This 30-day period is extremely short, considering the time that FmHA mustspend to review the previous operator's application and close the transaction.The Agency agrees and has removed the 30 day requirement to enter intoa lease or purchase agreement. The operator must, however, make applicationwithin 30 days. These changes have been incorporated in the rule.Section III.D. of Exhibit J, andSection; 1951.911(a) of Subpart S, providesfor free and knowing waiver of a person's or entity's right to Leaseback/Buyback.One respondent suggested that FmHA provide a waiver form that will be usedby borrowers waiving their rights to Leaseback/Buyback Programs. The Agencyhas adopted this comment by adding Exhibit Q, ``Waiver of Leaseback/BuybackRights,'' to the subpart in the interim rule.Section V. Exhibit J, now andSection; 1951.911(a) of Subpart S, deals withleaseback eligibility. The County Supervisor is required to determine whetherthe applicant for Leaseback/Buyback has financial management skills andfinancial resources to assure a reasonable prospect of success in the farmingoperation. Several respondents commented that ``Circumstances beyond theapplicant's control'' is relevant only if it reflects on the applicant'smanagement skill. The Agency agrees that management skills and financialresources are not eligibility criteria for Leaseback/Buyback and has revisedandSection; 1951.911(a) of this subpart. The County Supervisor, however,is still responsible for determining if the applicant has sufficient managementskill and financial resources to meet the terms and conditions of the lease.The change has been incorporated in the rule.Section VI.A. Exhibit J, now andSection; 1951.911(a) of Subpart S, requiresthe applicant to notify FmHA of his/her intention to use a cash or creditsale if the applicant is applying for buyback.One respondent commented that this section should be clarified to reflectthat the borrower is obligated to advise FmHA of whether or not they wanta cash or credit sale. The Agency has revised its notice to previous ownersto advise the previous owner that the purchase may be for cash or creditsale. The revision has been adopted into the rule.<T3>Attachment 1_``Agreement'' of this paragraph sets forth conditionalAgreement for leaseback. </T3>One respondent commented that this agreementshould specify the estimated rental payments and advise in the conditionalagreement that this rental payment may change if there is a lengthy periodof time between the signing of the agreement and the final signing of thelease. The Agency did not adopt this comment because it has determinedthat the market rent values will not fluctuate sufficiently during thetwo year period and the actual rent amount must be known for the borrowerto develop a plan of operation.<T3>Attachment 3_Notice of the Availability of Leaseback/Buyback </T3>ofthis paragraph is used to notify the previous operator to advise him/herthat he/she may have the opportunity to lease or buyback the property.Several respondents commented that since the previous operator's priorityconsideration for Leaseback/Buyback is not time limited in any fashion,the previous operator's application should always take priority over acomparable application up until the time the property is leased or sold.The Agency believes that it has administrative discretion to limit theprevious operator to 30 days in which to make application for leaseback/buyback.In addition, the previous operator will have an equal oppportunity to leaseor purchase the property when it becomes available for lease or sale toall eligible family farm size operators. The proposed rule is adopted.In the proposed rule, Exhibit I, now andSection; 1951.911(b) of Subpart S,``Farmer Programs Dwelling Retention'', is changed in the final rule from``Farmer Programs Dwelling Retention'' to ``Homestead Protection'' to conformwith the title of section 614 of the Act. The program was moved from ExhibitI of this subpart to andSection; 1951.911(b) of this subpart to combine HomesteadProtection and Farmland Leaseback/Buyback in the same section of the regulationunder the title of ``Preservation Loan Service Programs.'' This improvesthe readability, the logical flow and the conformity of the regulations.This is a result of comments received on the readability of the regulations.FmHA first implemented the dwelling Retention program on March 18, 1986(51 FR 9174), 7 CFR Part 1955, Subpart B as a result of the Food SecurityAct of 1985. The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 revised provisions ofthe 1985 bill. The major revisions are:1. A borrower may apply and enter into an agreement to lease with an optionto purchase before FmHA acquires title to farm property. 2. A borrower may apply regardless of how FmHA acquires the property. Thisis a change from the 1985 Act. 3. Maximum homestead acreage is increased from 5 acres to 10 acres. 4. The requirement of gross annual farm/land sales of at least $40,000has been deleted. 5. The purchase price is the market value when an applicant exercises theoption. 6. The borrower may request debt settlement for the existing balance ofthe FmHA debt. 7. This program applies when the primary loan service programs cannot helpthe borrower and FmHA has acquired the property or is about to acquireit from the borrower. Several comments were received on the proposed rule for this program. Thecomments are addressed to various sections of Exhibit I of this subpartof the proposed rule. <T3>Section III. B. Homestead Protection. </T3>One respondent commentedthat the requirement regarding the size of the property which the borrowercould retain may conflict with existing local land use requirements. Therequirement that the property will also include not more than 10 acresof adjoining land is set forth in Pub. L. 100-233, Agricultural CreditAct of 1987. Thus, the Agency cannot change this language of the proposedrule. If the minimum lot size permitted under local law is in excess of10 acres, FmHA may not be able to lease or sell the homestead protectionproperty to the borrower. <T3>Section III. D. Market Value. </T3>One respondent commented that thedefinition of market value should be clarified to indicate that the marketvalue will be established by an independent appraisal. This would insurethat FmHA will comply with the statutory provision that establishes themarket value will be the purchase price of the dwelling if the borrowerwishes to purchase the property. Sections IX and XI of this Exhibit clearlyidentify that all appraisals will be conducted by an independent appraiser.The Agency adopts the proposed rule as amended. <T3>Section IV. A. Determining Homestead Protection Property. </T3>Onerespondent commented that when a borrower informs the County Supervisorof his/her intention to participate in Homestead Protection, he/she mustalso inform the County Supervisor of the building and property the borrowerintends to include in the Homestead Protection property. However, thereare no notices that are given to the borrower which would indicate theborrower's responsibility for identifying the property which would be includedin the Homestead Protection property. It was suggested that the borrowerbe provided a notice of this responsibility. The Agency agrees and hasrevised Attachment 1 to Exhibit K to Subpart S and Exhibit M to SubpartS to request the borrower to submit to FmHA, a map or other descriptionof the buildings and property to be included in the Homestead Protectionproperty. The agency adopts this amendment as changed. <T3>Section IV. B. Processing Dwelling Retention Before FmHA Acquires Title.</T3>Several respondents commented that it should be made clear that anyonewho applies for Primary Loan Service and Preservation Loan Service Programsby responding to the ``Notice of the Availability of Loan Service Programs''should automatically be considered for Homestead Protection unless theborrower indicates that he/she does not have an interest in the program.They also felt that FmHA should consider Homestead Protection before takingaction to accelerate, liquidate, accept a voluntary conveyance or forecloseon a borrower's property if the Primary Loan Service Programs would notcorrect the financial problems of the borrower. The Agency agrees and thisparagraph has been revised to clarify that a borrower may be consideredfor Homestead Protection before acceleration and liquidation when it hasbeen determined that the primary servicing options will not work. Thisaction will depend upon receipt of the borrowers written request on Attachment2 to Exhibit A of this subpart. The Agency adopts the amendment. <T3>Section V. Eligibility. </T3>One respondent commented that the criteriathat the gross farm income which the applicant and any spouse must havereceived from the farming or ranching operation be reasonably commensuratewith the size and location of the farm and with local agricultural conditions.The suggestion made was that FmHA must define how the reasonably commensuratecriteria will be calculated. The Agency agrees and has revised this paragraphfor clarification by defining ``reasonably commensurate'' as relating tospecific individual borrower's past gross farm income compared to farmsof similar size and location. This comparison will take into account suchfactors as the size and location of the farm as well as well as the naturaland economic conditions at the time the comparison was performed. The Agencyadopts this proposed rule amendment.  One respondent commented that in this section there are references to ``circumstancesbeyond the borrower's control.'' They felt that the reference here wasdifferent than the definition of ``circumstances beyond the borrower'scontrol'' contained in the eligibility criteria for Primary Loan Servicing.They suggested if this was the case it should be made clear in this regulation.The Agency does agree with the comment and has revised this paragraph ofSubpart S to give examples of conditions beyond the borrower's controlsuch as illness, employment or conditions that make the dwelling uninhabitable.The Agency adopts the proposed rule as changed.  One respondent commented that the eligibility criteria that requires thatthe borrower must have continuously occupied the homestead property duringthe 6-year period preceding the calendar year in which the applicationis made for Homestead Protection is arbitrary. This requirement is fromPub. L. 100-233, Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. Thus, the Agency cannotchange this language of the proposed rule. One respondent commented that borrowers who applied for Homestead Protectionshould have to meet the same requirements as all other applicants who desireto purchase FmHA acquired property. These people have to be creditworthy,acted in good faith, and have sufficient income to repay the loan. Thoseborrowers who are eligible for homestead protection must have sufficientincome to make the rental payments for the term of the lease. The statutedoes not require that the borrower acted in good faith during the termof the previous loan; thus, the Agency cannot change this language of theproposed rule.<T3>Section VI. Transfer of Dwelling Retention Rights. </T3>One respondentfelt that this paragraph should allow for the transfer or assignment ofHomestead Protection rights to other dependent members of the applicantsfamily, besides the spouse. The reason was that there may be other dependentfamily members who are old enough to be able to maintain the property.The Agency does not agree as Pub. L. 100-233, Agricultural Credit Act of1987, provides that in the case of death or incompetency of such borrowers,such rights and agreements shall be transferable only to the spouse ofthe borrower if the spouse agrees to comply with the terms and conditionsthereof. Thus, the Agency cannot change this language of the proposed rule.<T3>Section VIII. Property Requirements. </T3>One respondent commentedthat if a borrower was interested in the cancellation of the debt, thatthe borrower should be responsible for paying any cost relating to HomesteadProtection, such as surveys, appraisals, etc. The respondent offered asuggestion that the first appraisal be paid by the FmHA as it is the seller.The Agency has determined that the costs associated with the sale of theHomestead Protection property, such as surveys, appraisals and legal descriptionsnecessary to define or describe the property will be paid by the Agency.The cost to the lessee, if he/she exercises the option to purchase willbe the same cost that an ordinary purchaser would be required to pay. TheAgency chooses to adopt the comment. <T3>Section X. Term of the Lease and Exercising the Option. </T3>One respondentcommented that it should be made clear that, if a borrower appeals FmHA'sdecision to terminate the lease, the termination of the lease will nottake place until after all of the appeals are completed. The Agency agrees,has amended the proposed rule accordingly. One respondent commented that this section should be clarified to indicatethat borrowers who exercise their rights to priority consideration forlease or sale of the rest of the farmland under the farmland Leaseback-BuybackProgram, will not be considered as interfering with the Government's effortsto lease or sell the property. The Agency agrees and has amended the proposedrule to clarify that an applicant exercising his/her rights under the Leaseback-BuybackProgram will not be considered as interfering with the Government's effortsto lease or sell the property. The Agency adopts comment and has revisedthe rule accordingly. One respondent commented that the term of the lease ``not less than threeyears'' was too restrictive. The respondent stated the statutory provisionsays that the lease term will be up to five years upon the borrower's request.Thus, the borrower should be able to enter into a lease agreement for oneor two years. The Agency agrees and has revised the regulations to providefor a lease up to 5 years to be consistent with the provisions of the AgriculturalCredit Act of 1987 and the terms provided for leaseback-buyback. The Agencyadopts the change as proposed. Several respondents commented that the requirements in section XI for asecond appraisal is unnecessary as the Food Security Act of 1985 indicatedFmHA would sell the Homestead Protection property if the price was determinedby a independent appraiser done within six months of the application forHomestead Protection. The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 provides thatthe borrower has the first right of refusal to reacquire the Homesteadproperty on such terms and conditions as FmHA determines, but FmHA maynot demand a payment for the property in excess of the current market valueestablished by an independent appraiser. The Agency in the proposed ruleestablished the concept of two appraisal to accommodate the 1987 Act asto the current market value requirement. The Agency has amended the proposedrule to require a second appraisal only if the first appraisal is morethan one-year old as it will insure that the lessee will obtain the dwellingat the current market value. One respondent commented that the lease agreement should clearly statethat a borrower must notify FmHA in writing that he/she intends to exercisethe option to purchase, and that he/she would like to be considered fora credit sale through FmHA. The proposed lease agreement in paragraph 9(1)sets forth the requirement that the lessee may exercise the option to purchaseat any time prior to the expiration of the lease by delivering to the FmHACounty Supervisor a signed written statement notifying FmHA that the lesseeis exercising the option to purchase the property. The Agency adopts theproposed rule. <T3>Attachment 2_Dwelling Retention Program Agreement. </T3>One respondentcommented that ``FmHA has commenced action to foreclose'' indicates thenext step is foreclosure. It was further stated that in many instancesFmHA may not have actually initiated a foreclosure action when a borroweris asked to sign this agreement and this reference to foreclosure couldcause a misunderstanding. The Agency agrees and has modified this paragraphto state ``Borrower's FmHA loan is in default which could result in theloss of the borrower's property.''One respondent stated that where FmHA must acquire fee title to the HomesteadProtection property seems to indicate that if the borrower is not liquidatingall of the real estate property securing the loan but, rather, is simplyconveying the part of this property which includes Homestead Protectionproperty, they may not be eligible to obtain the Homestead Protection.It was suggested that FmHA should consider a partial liquidation whichwould allow the borrower to convey a portion of his/her real estate inexchange for Homestead Protection lease and service the remainder of thedebt through the Primary Loan Service Programs. The Agency has amendedthis section by not referencing the liquidation of the farm property. Theborrower may apply for Leaseback/Buyback which, if approved, would notrequire liquidation of the farm. The Agency will not authorize the combinationof Primary and Preservation Programs. By keeping the Primary and PreservationPrograms separate, it will ensure that the borrower has received the maximumwrite-down of the debt and also insure that if the primary programs willnot assist the borrower he/she has the option of retaining the dwelling.The Agency adopts the proposed rule as revised. One respondent commented on the rental price for the Homestead Protectionproperty and that for a borrower who is considering voluntary conveyance,it is very important that he/she be informed up front of the lease termsas this information will have a bearing on the borrower's decision if itis to his/her advantage to enter into the voluntary conveyance in exchangefor the Homestead Protection Agreement. It was suggested that FmHA determinethe rental price when negotiating with the borrower prior to signing theHomestead Protection Program Agreement. The Agency agrees and has amendedthe agreement to provide that the rental will be determined before theagreement is executed. It was also pointed out by the respondent that in some instances a lengthyperiod of time between the signing of the Homestead Protection Agreementand the actual leasing of the property may occur and that it should bemade clear that if the lease does not begin because of FmHA's inabilityor failure to comply with the local laws, the borrower's eligibility forHomestead Protection will not be affected. However, if under local lawit is impossible to create a Homestead Protection lot with a maximum of10 acres (i.e., local law requires a larger parcel), it will be impossibleto provide the borrower with a Homestead Protection property. The Agencyagrees with the comment and has amended this paragraph to provide the rightfor an appeal. One respondent commented that the Homestead Protection Program is confiscatoryand self-servicing on the part of the Government and that a borrower shouldnot be required to sign away or waiver any rights that they may have infee title and homestead exemption rights. The Agency does not agree asthe Homestead Protection Program provides borrowers an opportunity to reacquirethe homestead they originally pledged as security for loans. The eligibilityrequirements for the Homestead Protection Program are all required by lawand are designed to provide borrowers with a second chance to save theirhomesteads if they are faced with the prospect of losing their entire farm.In addition, any State law(s) granting greater homestead rights than Federallaw, will prevail. The Agency adopts the proposed rule. <T3>Section 1951.912_Mediation. </T3>This section discusses FmHA's participationin the Mediation Program. It states that where State programs of mediationmake participation voluntary on the part of creditors, FmHA's participationwill also be voluntary. Several respondents stated that this section implies that if the Stateprogram is voluntary, FmHA may, in that State determine that it simplywill not participate in that State's program. The Agency did not intendto imply this interpretation and therefore has rewritten this section toclarify that FmHA will participate in mediation programs where a Statehas a USDA certified mediation program. However, where a State's mediationprogram makes participation in mediations voluntary on the part of creditorsin that State, FmHA's participation will also be voluntary. Since FmHAfavors the use of mediation, of course, it ordinarily will decide to participatein mediations conducted under such a program. The Agency has also incorporatedother minor changes in the language to clarify how FmHA shall participatein a certified State Mediation Program. Several respondents commented that paragraph (b), which relates to FmHA'sorganization of voluntary meetings between the borrower and creditors,be clarified to show that FmHA is willing to make some adjustments in itspayment schedule and is not simply expecting the other creditors to makesuch concessions. The Agency agrees with this comment and has incorporatedchanges for clarification, along with other additions and minor changesin language, in the interim rule. Paragraph (b)(3) states that the State Director will appoint an FmHA employeenot previously involved in servicing of the borrower's account to participatein the meeting with creditors. One respondent commented that the notice sent to the borrower advisingthem of the date of the meeting should state that the borrower has an opportunityto request someone other than the County Supervisor to represent FmHA atthe meeting. The Agency agrees and has incorporated this in the rule. Several respondents commented that FmHA should make it clear in paragraph(b)(4) that whenever the net recovery to FmHA will be greater using thewrite down than to go through foreclosure, that FmHA will continue to usethe write down regardless of the actions of the other creditors. The Agencyhas incorporated this, along with other minor additions. Paragraph (b)(5) relates to agreements reached at the ``meeting of creditors.''One respondent commented that it is important to obtain the borrower'swritten signature on the agreement as well as the other creditors, demonstratingthat all parties are in actual agreement. The Agency agrees and has incorporatedthis comment.One respondent recommended that a paragraph be developed in this sectionrequiring State Directors to develop a State supplement that describeshow FmHA will participate in its State Mediation Program. The respondentstated that all of the various State Mediation Programs are substantiallydifferent. This suggestion has been incorporated and also, a paragraphhas been added to clarify the duties of the representative at the meetingof creditors when there is no certified State Agricultural Mediation Program.The rule has also been revised to suggest that State Directors use a mediatorin the meeting of creditors when qualified mediations are available.<T3>Section 1951.914_Servicing approved primary loan service program. </T3>Thissection states the terms and conditions with which FmHA loan notes maybe consolidated, rescheduled or reamortized during the Shared AppreciationAgreement period.One respondent commented that FmHA will be in violation of statutory intentif it does not make consolidation, rescheduling and reamortization availableto the borrower again before it takes action on a delinquency that developsduring the shared appreciation period. The proposed rule states that FmHAwill not consolidate, reschedule or reamortize loans during the sharedappreciation period. The Agency agrees with the respondent and has incorporatedthe comment with other minor changes to permit such actions during theshared appreciation agreement period and has entitled this section ``ServicingPrimary Loan Service Programs.''Paragraph (d)(1) provides for the borrower to pick an appraiser from thelist of three provided by FmHA to do the appraisal at the time the recapturewill take place.One respondent commented that since the borrower and FmHA will share inthe cost of the appraisal at the end of the recapture period, it is importantthat the appraisal be done only if it is absolutely necessary. If the recapturewill take place as a result of conveyance by the borrower and an appraisalis done along with the sale or conveyance, that appraisal should sufficefor purposes of determining the amount of recapture.The Agency believes that it is necessary that the appraiser who conductsan appraisal of the real estate security involving a Recapture Agreementbe both qualified and independent. Since FmHA is responsible for collectingthe amount due under the agreement, the appraisal must be accurate. Incases where the borrower voluntarily conveys the property to FmHA, thenFmHA would complete the appraisal and the borrower would have no appraisalcosts unless he/she chose to have an approved independent appraiser completean appraisal at the borrower's expense. The proposed rule is adopted withno change.Paragraph (d)(2) relates to notifying the borrower of the amount due tobe recaptured. This paragraph requires that the borrower pay the recaptureamount within 90 days or the notice of the borrower's account will be treatedas delinquent and FmHA will proceed with collection efforts, which mayinclude foreclosure.Several respondents commented that the recapture calculations should beappealable, and that the borrower should receive the ``Notice of the Availabilityof Loan Service Programs'' prior to acceleration, liquidation or foreclosure.Also, the respondents commented that FmHA should make an attempt to ensurethat the shared appreciation agreements alone do not force farmers offtheir land. FmHA should give the borrower the choice to amortize the recaptureportion over the remaining life of the loan. The Agency agrees with thesecomments and has incorporated the changes, along with other minor changesin language.<T3>Section 1951.916_Exception authority. </T3>This section sets forththe Administrator's authority to make an exception, on an individual casebasis, to any requirement or provision of this subpart which is not consistentwith the statute or other applicable law if the requirement or provisionwould adversely affect the Government's interest.Two respondents commented that the exception authority leaves open thepossibility of some people to receive special treatment and recommendedthat there be no exceptions to the rule. The Agency believes that it isnecessary that such authority be available. In a rule of this magnitude,all situations are seldom covered. An exception authority is necessaryto effectively administer the program. The Agency adopts the proposed ruleas modified to clarify that the exception authority may also cover omissionsin the regulations and address situations such as where the immediate healthand/or safety of tenants or the community are endangered.<T3>Section 1951.917 FmHA Debt Restructuring Support Teams (DRST). </T3>Thissection has been added to provide State debt restructuring support teamsto be deployed in States when unusually large number of Primary and/orPreservation Loan Service Program applications are received. State DebtRestructuring Support Teams (DRST) will consist of a team leader and teammembers, selected by the State Director. This section has also incorporatedprovisions for National Office DRST team leaders to assist State Directorsin training of personnel and organizing the processing of debt restructuringactivities. The Agency has added this section to assure that when unusuallylarge numbers of Primary and Preservation Loan Service Program applicationsare received that adequate personnel are assigned to assist in renderingprompt service to farmers in serious financial difficulty.<T3>Section 1951.918 FmHA Debt Restructuring Assessment Teams (DRAT). </T3>Thissection has been added providing for State Debt Restructuring AssessmentTeams (DRAT) in order to monitor Primary and Preservation Loan ServiceProgram processing. State Directors are required to deploy DRATs on a continuingbasis to areas having unusually large numbers of Primary and PreservationLoan Service Program activity. The teams will monitor debt restructuringprocessing activities in order to minimize loan servicing errors, especiallyin determining eligibility and calculating net recovery value and debtwrite-down. The Agency has added this section to assure that problems arefound and appropriate corrective action is promptly taken. State Directorteam leader reports will be monitored by the Assistant Administrator forFarmers Programs.<T3>Exhibits and Attachments. </T3>The proposed rule has numerous Exhibitsand Attachments for communicating with borrowers. These are identifiedas Exhibit A with Attachments 1 through 10, include detailed informationon the availability of Primary and Preservation Loan Service Programs.They also provide detailed explanations of the forms used and deadlineand procedures involved in applying for assistance under the debt restructuringprovisions of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987.As required by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 (Act) some of thesenotices will be sent to borrowers who received the notices involved in<T3>Coleman</T3> v. <T3>Lyng,</T3> 663 F. Supp. 1315 (D.N.D. 1987). Both the Government and<T3>Coleman</T3> Plaintiffs have appealed <T3>Coleman</T3> to the Eighth Circuit. The Government sought an expeditedhearing in <T3>Coleman</T3> because it believes that the Agricultural Credit Act of1987 (Act) moots the June 2 injunction and certain elements of the May7 decision. Recently, the Eighth Circuit denied an expedited hearing andset a hearing date of September 19, 1988. However, section 624 of the Actrequires that final rules be implemented within 150 days after January6, 1988, the effective date of the Act. Several provisions of the Act require that borrowers who received the noticesinvolved in <T3>Coleman</T3> also receive the new notices. The Agency has attemptedto resolve these complexities within the rulemaking process. The <T3>Coleman</T3> decision found that FmHA must give a separate electionof options for each loan accelerated and for each reason for the proposedadverse action. However, the Court based this requirement on its analysisthat FmHA's previously used Form FmHA 1924-26 (Borrower Acknowledgementof Notice of Intent to Take Adverse Action) required borrowers to makea binding election of one type of option on Form FmHA 1924-26, the responseform to Form FmHA 1924-25 (Notice of Intent to Take Adverse Action). However,because such a binding election of options is now prohibited by section331D(b)(2) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, as amendedby section 605(b)(2) of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, these rulesdo not require borrowers to select among the options offered. The process used by these interim rules is a sequential one. All borrowerswho are 180 days delinquent or who have been accelerated (but not thereafterforeclosed or liquidated) will receive Exhibit A with Attachments 1 and2 of this subpart. These notices inform borrowers that their payments toFmHA are seriously behind schedule. As required by section 605 of the Act,the notices also provide a summary of all primary loan service programsand preservation loan service programs, copies of the forms needed to apply,advice on how to get copies of the FmHA regulations, and a descriptionof the FmHA appeal process. The May 7 <T3>Coleman</T3> decision ordered FmHA to prepare a similar, but less comprehensive,summary of servicing options which would be available to borrowers upontheir request. The <T3>Coleman</T3> summary was intended to supplement the notice forms andprovide enough information for borrowers to make a choice between the optionsoffered. As mentioned above, these interim rules do not require or permita binding choice between the options. Attachment 1 of Exhibit A of thissubpart contains the summary required by the Act. In these interim rules,FmHA has considered and substantially adopted the summary prepared by the<T3>Coleman</T3> Plaintiffs. However, the Act also requires that the summary contained in the new noticesoffered additional options which were not in existence at the time of <T3>Coleman</T3> (e.g., debt write-down). The preservation loan serviceoptions which were expanded by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 werenot part of the <T3>Coleman</T3> case. Borrowers who receive Exhibit A and Attachments1 and 2 will be considered for all the primary and preservation loan serviceoptions if they return Attachment 2 of Exhibit A of this subpart within45 days of their receipt of these notices. Certain other <T3>Coleman</T3> borrowers and borrowers with new defaults will be sentdifferent notices. Borrowers who converted FmHA security, borrowers whoare 180 days delinquent and also converted FmHA security, or borrowerswho have violated their nonmonetary agreements with FmHA will receive Attachments1, 3 and 4 of Exhibit A of this subpart. These notices describe the borrower'sdefaults with FmHA. However, they also offer the borrower the opportunityfor a meeting with FmHA, a hearing and the opportunity to apply for servicing.To comply with the <T3>Coleman</T3> orders and section 605 of the Act, these borrowers alsodo not have a choose among the options offered. As noted by the <T3>Coleman</T3> Court, there may be more than one loan involved and/ormore than one reason for default. The <T3>Coleman</T3> Court concluded that the notices in this situation requireda choice by borrowers between servicing or appeals. In the Court's view,while borrowers who chose servicing would also get appeals, borrowers whochose appeals would not get servicing. Under these interim rules all borrowerswill clearly have the option of remedying or appealing an alleged conversionof security property by requesting a meeting or a hearing, at the sametime as they have the option of requesting servicing to correct their delinquency.To pursue these options, these borrowers must simply return Attachment4 after checking the appropriate item or items. All <T3>Coleman</T3> borrowers and other borrowers who apply for servicingbut are rejected will receive Attachments 5 and 6. These notices informthem of FmHA's servicing calculations and the reasons why FmHA is rejectingtheir servicing request. These notices inform borrowers that FmHA intendsto foreclose their accounts because it believes they cannot develop a feasibleplan or do not qualify for servicing options. Unlike Form FmHA 1924-26,Attachment 6 does not require borrowers to make a binding choice betweenthe options. Rather, Attachment 6 offers these borrowers the opportunityfor a meeting <T3>and</T3> a hearing, and the opportunity to pursue preservation loanservice options. Certain of these borrowers may also purchase the propertyat a reduced value. However, borrowers are permitted to choose <T3>one or more of these options.</T3> Like the other notices of the subpart,the notice does not require a binding election of options. Of equal importancethe notices are clear and readable. In Attachments 5 and 6, FmHA has adoptedthe format and a substantial amount of the language suggested by the <T3>Coleman</T3> Plaintiffs. Attachments 7, 8, 9, and 10 may also be issued to <T3>Coleman</T3> borrowers and other borrowers who do not respond to theservicing notices within the required time. Attachments 7 and 8 continuethe accelerations of borrowers who have not applied for servicing. Attachments9 and 10 are notices which propose to accelerate or continue the accelerationof borrowers who reject FmHA's offer to restructure their debts. Attachments9 and 10 provide hearing rights in this situation. These notices are alsoissued to nonaccelerated borrowers who have not applied for servicing,and offers them the opportunity to appeal the alleged defaults. These notices (Attachments 1-10 of Exhibit A of this subpart) are publishedwith these interim rules. They comply with the <T3>Coleman</T3> decisions to the extent allowed by the Agricultural CreditAct of 1987 and are required by law to be issued. FmHA will eliminate FormsFmHA 1924-14, 1924-25 and 1924-26 involved in the <T3>Coleman</T3> case. Instead the Agency will use Exhibit A and Attachments1-10 for each instance of default. The borrower will receive one, or atthe most three, sets of notices with Exhibit A. The number of notices isdetermined by whether the borrower applies for servicing and qualifiesfor servicing and accepts FmHA's restructuring offer. In implementing theseinterim rules, the Agency is complying with the intent of Congress whichstated it would be resolving the <T3>Coleman</T3> litigation by enacting the Agricultural Credit Act of1987. Several respondents commented on the number and readability of the notices.One respondent did an in-depth, highly detailed analysis of the languageand organization of the various notices. This respondent also hired a readabilityexpert who found the proposed notices short on clarity and general design.The respondent redesigned and rewrote the notices in a form that the Agencywill use with certain modifications so they can apply to more borrowers.These comments were also supported by several other farm groups and Stateofficials throughout the Midwest farm belt. Specifically, the revised formsinclude Exhibit A and Attachments 1, 2, 5 and 6. Exhibit A_Attachments 1 and 2 have been written so that they are readableand understandable to the FmHA borrower. Exhibit A_Attachments 3 and 3A have been deleted. These notifications wereto be used in cases where borrowers' FmHA loan accounts were acceleratedbetween November 1, 1985, and May 7, 1987, who did not request debt restructuringand release of normal farm income. Several respondents commented that there should be no need for this Noticeprovision since the statutory language requires all borrowers at lease180-days delinquent to receive ``Notice of the Availability of Loan ServicePrograms.'' It was not the intent to exclude these borrowers as they wouldhave received the Notice because they are at least 180 days delinquent.The Agency agrees and has deleted these exhibits. Exhibit A_Attachments 3 and 4 in the interim rule are notices sent to borrowerswith non-monetary defaults, non-monetary defaults with monetary defaultsand when a prior lienholder or junior lienholder is foreclosing. This Noticeadvises the borrower that FmHA intends to accelerate their FmHA loan accountsbecause of unapproved disposition of security property; they have stoppedfarming; or have violated other provisions of their loan agreements withFmHA. These borrowers also will receive Attachment 1 of Exhibt A, ``Primaryand Preservation Loan Service Programs,'' and are told they can apply forthem by returning Attachment 4 within 45 days of their receipt of the notices.Several respondents commented that certain paragraphs need to be clarifiedto make it easier for the borrower to understand what allegations may be<T3>contested</T3> and/or appealed if the situation is not resolved duringa meeting with FmHA officials. The Agency agrees and has incorporated theclarification. Also, Exhibit A_Attachment 6, ``Response to Notice of Intentto Accelerate or Continue Acceleration and Notice of Borrower's Rights,''has been changed to clarify that the borrower is requesting considerationfor all Primary and Preservation Loan Service Programs, including LoanDeferral and Debt Write-Down when the borrower responds to Exhibit A_Attachments5. Exhibit A_Attachments 5 and 6 have been redesignated Exhibit A_Attachments3 and 4 respectively. Exhibit A_Attachment 5, ``Notice of Intent to Accelerate or Continue Accelerationand Notice of your Rights'' is used to notify borrowers of their rightto meet with FmHA officials; to pay FmHA the net recovery value of thecollateral; to request voluntary conveyance of the collateral to FmHA and/oradvise the borrower of their Preservation Loan Service Program rights andappeal rights, when a feasible plan cannot be developed or the borroweris ineligible for primary loan servicing for other reasons. Attachment6 of Exhibit A is used by the borrower to respond to Attachment 5 of ExhibitA. Several respondents' comments provided some clarification language to reflectwhen FmHA has determined that a feasible plan of operation cannot be developedusing all combination of Primary Loan Service Programs, including the SoftwoodTimber Program, and Conservation Easement Program. Also, the Attachmenthas been retitled and restructured to provide a dual notification for bothborrowers with accelerated and non-accelerated FmHA farmer program accounts.Attachments 7 and 8 of Exhibit A have been designated as Attachments 5and 6 of Exhibit A along with changes in language style for clarity andreadability. Attachment 7 of Exhibit A has been retitled and changed to be used to notifyborrowers of their rights, whose FmHA loan accounts have been accelerated,fail to respond to Attachment 1 of Exhibit A. Attachment 8 of Exhibit Ais used by the borrower to respond to Attachment 7 of Exhibit A. Exhibit A_Attachment 9, is being modified to notify borrowers who do notapply for or reject FmHA's offer for Primary Loan Service Programs. Attachment10, ``Response to Notice of Intent to Accelerate and Notice of BorrowerRights,'' will be used by the borrower to respond to Attachment 9 of ExhibitA. Exhibit B, ``Noncash Credit for Farmer Program Loans When EstablishingRecapture,'' has been changed for administrative purposes for capturingand reporting information on loans written-down with other changes in language.Exhibit C, ``Equity Recapture Agreement,'' has been retitled as ``Net RecoveryBuy Out Agreement,'' to clarify its use for recapturing the differencebetween the net recovery value and market value of the collateral whensold by the borrower within 2 years of purchase by the borrower at netrecovery value. The language of the Exhibit has been clarified to statethat the new mortgage or deed of trust will be released 2 years from thedate of the recapture agreement if the borrower does not sell or conveythe property. This change was made after considering a comment that theAgency is required to release the security instrument after the 2 yearperiod. Exhibit D, ``Shared Appreciation Agreement,'' has been adopted along withother minor changes in language. Exhibit E, ``Notification of Request for Mediation or Meeting of Creditors,''has been amended to state why the borrower is unable to develop a feasibleFarm and Home Plan and why other creditors may need to adjust the borrower'sdebt in order for the borrower to qualify for Primary Loan Service Programs.Other minor changes in language have been made. Exhibit F, ``Notification of Offer to Restructure Debt,'' has been amendedto clarify that the borrower may accept the FmHA restructuring offer notlater than 45-days from receipt of the Notice. Also, Attachment 1, ``Acceptanceof Offer to Restructure My Debt,'' has been added to provide a responseform for borrowers who are accepting an offer to restructure debt. Exhibit G, ``Deferral, Reamortization, and Reclassification of DistressedFarmer Program Loans for Softwood Timber Production Loans,'' that provideseligibility guidelines and processing procedures has been amended to statethat accurately accounting for sale of security means that the borrowerhas complied with the reporting and accounting requirements. This changealong with other minor changes in language and additions has been made.Exhibit H, Primary Loan Service Programs Farm Debt Restructuring ConservationSet-Aside Easement), sets forth the process for determining the amountof loan that is to be written off in exchange for the conservation easement.The major points are as follows: <T3>Major Points</T3>I. The land must be suitable for conservation, recreationand/or wildlife habitat purposes and secures an FmHA loan that was closedbefore December 23, 1985.II. The land must be wetland, wildlife habitat, highly erodible or environmentallyimportant upland that, except for wetland and wildlife habitat, was rowcropped for the three years prior to December 23, 1985.III. FmHA may reduce the debt in exchange for an easement on a portionof the farm.IV. An easement review term will review each site and make a report toFmHA.V. The term of the easement must be for a minimum of 50 years.VI. An enforcement authority will assure that the purpose of the easementis accomplished.VII. The easement land cannot be used for agricultural purposes duringthe term of the easement. However, if the land is in the Conservation ReserveProgram (CRP) prior to being used for easement purposes, the CRP contractwill continue but the farmer will not collect the CRP payments.The title of the program is shortened for clarity and ease of use by eliminatingthe word, ``Set-Aside''.<T3>Paragraph I. General.</T3> One respondent suggested that ``wildlifehabitat'' be added as a purpose for a conservation easement. The Agencyadopts this suggestion. Several comments were received suggesting thatConservation Easement be considered before write-down, as a Primary ServiceProgram and that they not be considered in the net recovery determination.The Agency adopts the suggestion that Conservation Easements not be consideredin the net recovery determination. A Conservation Easement will be consideredbefore write down, it the borrower submits the appropriate form and theconservation easement enables the borrower to develop a feasible plan.FmHA's ``Primary and Preservation Loan Service Programs,'' which is Attachment1 of Exhibit A of this subpart, tells borrowers how to apply for a conservationeasement. Attachment 1 explains that borrowers wanting to apply for a conservationeasement must submit an Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Serviceor Soil Conservation Service photo of the farm showing the approximatenumber of acres for the conservation easement and return it with Attachment2 of Exhibit A of this subpart within 45 days of receiving Attachment 1.If the borrower does not apply for a conservation easement at this time,the borrower will be considered for conservation easement if debt write-downdoes not produce a feasible plan to determine whether a conservation easementwhen combined with debt write-down will produce a feasible plan.This method of processing is consistent with FmHA's general servicing policywhich is to keep borrowers on the farm and avoid losses to the Govrnment.The mandate requires FmHA to use the least costly servicing options shortof write-down (which now is defined to include conservation easements)<T3>if</T3> these options allow the borrower to develop a feasible planof operation. The policy is explained in the andSection; 1951.902 of theprosposed and interim rules. See also 53 FR 18395 (May 23, 1988) in thepreamble of the proposed rules for additional discussion of the policy.The policy received no adverse comments except as to the order of processingfor conservation easements. The Agency has attempted to clarify the processingof conservation easements as explained above. Borrowers have the opportunityto be considered for a conservation easement both before and after debt-writedown. If FmHA rejects a borrower's request for a conservation easement(or any other primary loan servicing option), the borrower will have theopportunity to appeal the adverse decision.<T3>Paragraph I (d).</T3> A respondent suggested that the definition ofwildlife habitat be expanded to include wetlands and waters which adjoina borrower's farm.The agency does not adopt this suggestion because there is no statutoryauthority to take easements on properties other than from FmHA borrowers.One respondent suggested that the definition of ``upland'' in paragraph(1)(c) be expanded to areas that are contributing to nonpoint source pollutionof surface or ground water.The Agency believes this suggestion goes beyond the intent of the statute,therefore, it will not be adopted.<T3>Paragraph III. Establishing Easement Review Team.</T3> One respondentrequested that Conservation Districts be authorized to serve on the EasementReview Team to help insure local community input.The Agency adopts the suggestion.<T3>Paragraph IV. Responsibilities of the Easement Review Team.</T3> Onerespondent recommended that the rights and restrictions that accrue tothe holder of the easement, such as the right to permit public access tohunt and fish on easement land, be clarified. All rights and restrictionsrelating to the easement are set forth in the easement forms, Form FmHA1951-39 and FmHA 1951-39A, in accordance with the Easement Review Teamrecommendations on an individual case basis. These Forms are availablein any FmHA office. Public access to hunt and fish on easement land orother rights would have to be determined on an individual case basis bythe easement review team; therefore, the recommendation is not adopted.<T3>Paragraph VI. Terms of Easements.</T3> Several respondents suggestedthat farming be authorized on easement land while one large conservationorganization recommended that the borrower not crop easement land.The Agency believes that the intent of the statute is to remove land fromfarming by placing it into conservation, recreation and wildlife uses.Except for wetland and wildlife habitats, the statute requires that suchland had to have been row cropped for 3 years prior to December 23, 1985;therefore, we are not adopting this suggestion.One respondent stated that the term of the easement should be in perpetuityrather than a minimum of 50 years.The existing regulation provides for perpetual easements under certainconditions. The Agency believes the elimination of the 50-year minimumeasement term would be contrary to the intent of the statute.<T3>Paragraph VII. Determining the Amount of Farmer Program Debt That canbe Cancelled.</T3> One respondent suggested that the amount of debt forgivenessnot be limited to the value of the land held as collateral.Section 349(e) of the CONACT limits the amount of debt foregiveness tonot more than the value of the easement land or the difference betweenthe debt and value of the easement land, whichever is greater. Therefore,the Agency does not adopt the suggestion.Several respondents stated that the proposed method used to calculate theamount of debt to be cancelled is incorrect.The Agency believes its method for calculating the amount of debt to becancelled is correct. The respondents do not consider the statutory requirmentlimiting the value of the easement land and the easement debt to an amountthat is not in excess to the value of the easement land. Also, the respondentsincorrectly interpreted the difference between the debt and value of theland to mean the total farm debt and total land value rather than the differencebetween the debt against the easement land and value of the easement land.Therefore, the request for a change is not adopted.A respondent stated that the reference to paragraph (VI) found in paragraphVII B should be changed to paragraph (VII).The Agency agrees and adopts this suggestion.Two respondents suggested that the borrower should pay the cost of titlesearches, surveys, recording fees, etc.The Agency elects to pay such costs to encourage the use of conservationeasements and to assist borrowers who are unable to repay their FmHA loanswithout the easement to remain in farming. This suggested change is notadopted.<T3>Paragraph VIII. Violation of Terms and Conditions.</T3> Two respondentssuggested that the FmHA borrower be responsible for all costs incurredby the enforcement authority. The suggestion is adopted.<T3>Paragraph IX. Responsibilities of the Enforcement Authority.</T3> Tworespondents recommended that FmHA assign its rights and interests as theholder of the easement to the Enforcement Authority. The Agency will not adopt these recommendations because the statute doesnot provide authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to assign its interestas the holder of the easement.Exhibit I, ``Farmer Program Homestead Protection,'' and Exhibit J, ``FarmerProgram Leaseback/Buyback,'' explained the eligibility and processing procedurein the proposed rule. Section 1951.911 of Subpart S of Part 1951 of thischapter now contains the regulations relative to the Preservation ServicingPrograms.Exhibit I, ``Guidelines for Determining Adjustments for Net Recovery Valueof Collateral,'' is to be used for determining the value of net recoveryfrom involuntary liquidation. Exhibit J has been redesignated and titled,``Debt Loan Restructuring System (DALR$),'' to be used to find the LoanServicing Programs best suited for the borrower's farming operation, andThe Agency agrees with several respondents that commented that it is imperativethat these programs and/or the instructions describing exactly how theprogram for making the calculations for restructuring farm loan debt bemade available to the public. The new exhibits explain in detail how thesoftware for DALR$ works and how the recovery cost will be calculated bythe computer. The computer printout will indicate if the Government willgain more by continuing with borrower by providing Primary Loan Servicingor by obtaining the net recovery value through liquidation as requiredby the Act. The interim rule is amended to incorporate these additions.Exhibit K, ``Notice of Consideration for Preservation Loan Service Programs''and Attachment 1, ``Response to Notification of Consideration for PreservationLoan Service Programs,'' has been added.Several respondents commented that when borrowers respond to the ``Noticeof the Availability of Loan Service Programs,'' they should automaticallybe considered for all Primary Loan Servicing Programs. If they are unableto qualify for any of the Primary Loan Servicing Programs, FmHA shouldautomatically consider them for Homestead Protection and Leaseback/Buyback.The Agency agrees, unless the borrower responds to ``Notice of the Availabilityof Loan Service Programs,'' the borrower will be considered for PreservationLoan Service Programs. Exhibit K will be used to notify borrowers thattheir application for Preservation Loan Service Programs will be automaticallyconsidered if they are determined not eligible for Primary Loan Service.The borrower can withdraw the application by completing Attachment 1 ofExhibit K. The rule is amended to incorporate these additions, along withminor changes in language to ensure that the Preservation Loan Servicingconsideration will occur before voluntary conveyance, acceleration, liquidation,or foreclosure.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1955_PROPERTY MANAGEMENT</ITAG>Subpart A_Liquidation for Loans Secured by Real Estate and AcquisitionThis subpart delegates authority and prescribes procedures for the liquidationof FmHA loans and acquisition of property by voluntary conveyance to theGovernment, by foreclosure of security instruments, by exercise of theGovernment's redemption rights, and certain other actions which resultin acquisition of the property by the Government.<T3>Section 1955.3_Definitions.</T3> The Agency proposed to add to thissection the definition of Dwelling Retention. No comments were receivedon this section. The Agency, however, will replace the term ``DwellingRetention'' with the term ``Homestead Protection'' in order to be consistentwith the term used in the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. The definitionis adopted as proposed except the term ``Homestead Protection'' replaces``Dwelling Retention.''<T3>Section 1955.10_Voluntary conveyance of real property by the borrowerto the Government.</T3> The Agency proposed to delete reference to FormsFmHA 1924-25 and 1924-26 and substitute reference to Attachments 1 and2 of Exhibit A of Subparts S of Part 1951 of this chapter. The Agency alsoproposed to set forth specific guidelines for voluntary conveyance andpayment of liens in accordance with andSection; 1955.67 of Subpart B of thispart.While no comments were received specific to the proposed revision, severalcomments were received related to this section. One respondent commentedthat this section pertained only to Farmer Program loans made to an individualand should include Farmer Programs loans made to cooperative, partnership,joint operations and cooperatives. No revisions were made related to thecomment because this matter is covered in the definition of ``Loans toIndividuals.'' The definition states that it includes those Farmer Programloans made to individuals or entities. One comment was received suggestingthat Farmer Programs borrowers who received unauthorized assistance asdetermined under Subpart L of Part 1951 of this chapter should be consideredfor Primary and Preservation Loan Service Programs. This comment was adoptedand the regulations amended to provide that when it is determined thatall conditions of Subpart L of Part 1951 of this chapter have been met,loans for unauthorized assistance will be treated as authorized loans andExhibit A with Attachments 1 and 2 of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapterwill be sent prior to acceptance of a voluntary conveyance.One comment was received suggesting that reference in andSection; 1955.10(d)(8)to proposed Exhibits 3, 3A and 4 of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chaptershould be deleted because of legal reasons. Subpart S of Part 1951 of thischapter has been revised deleting the proposed Exhibits 3, 3A and 4. ProposedExhibits 5 and 6 of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapter have been redesignatedas Exhibits 3 and 4, respectively.One comment was received suggesting that FmHA, rather than the Office ofthe General Counsel, be authorized to accept less than full payments onaccelerated Rural Housing (RH) Loans. This comment was not adopted becauseit was determined that the Office of General Counsel should recommend thenecessary action on those cases referred to their office for legal action.The proposed rule is adopted in the interim final.The Agency had administratively adopted Exhibit G, ``Worksheet for Determiningthe Recovery Value of Farmer Program Real Estate Value,'' (available inany FmHA office) referred to in this section in the interim rule noticethat will provide guidance to the County Supervisor in determining if itis in the Government's financial interest to accept a voluntary conveyanceof real estate. This worksheet is also to be completed when determiningthe Government's bid at any real property foreclosure sale, and in determiningif the Government will exercise its redemption rights on foreclosed property.<T3>Section 1955.15_Foreclosure by the Government of loans secured by realestate.</T3> The Agency proposed to delete references to Forms FmHA 1924-14,1924-25 and 1924-26, and to substitute reference to Attachments 1 and 2of Exhibit A of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapter. Section 1955.15was also revised to clarify the handling of SFH loans, and to provide guidancefor handling offers made by a borrower after acceleration. A comment wasreceived suggesting that this section be revised to clearly indicate thata borrower who is indebted for both Single Family Housing and Farmer Programloans, would retain all rights to servicing procedures under both programs.No changes were made to this section because it was determined that thismatter was adequately covered under the respective loan servicing regulations.One respondent commented that Exhibit D, ``Notice of Acceleration-FarmerPrograms Loan Accounts Secured by Real Estate and/or Chattels,'' referredto in this section, be revised to advise the borrower that the remainingdebt may be satisfied by debt settlement in conjunction with a voluntaryconveyance, transfer and assumption or cash sale. This comment has beenadopted and Exhibit D has been revised to advise the borrower that satisfactionof the remaining debt may be debt settled in conjunction with a cash saleof the security property, voluntary conveyance of property to FmHA and/ortransfer and assumption.One respondent commented on the provision that provided that if the borrowerbrings the account current after acceleration and later becomes delinquentagain, the borrower will not have an opportunity to correct the defaultexcept by satisfying the debt in full. The respondent suggested that theconcept of acceleration means the entire debt is due within the 30 daysafter the acceleration notice and if the borrower pays this amount, thereis no longer any debt owed to FmHA on which the borrower could later becomedelinquent. The Agency agrees with the respondent that this provision ismisleading and has determined that the borrower will have ample noticeof FmHA's intended actions to accelerate and adequate opportunity to resolvethe delinquency prior to the acceleration notice. The Agency, however,is aware that individual States may have specific State laws that requirethe acceleration to be terminated if the borrower cures the default. TheAgency has reconsidered its proposed rule and has deleted the provisionallowing the borrower to bring the account current after acceleration inthe interim rule. The interim rule, however, does provide an exceptionfor those States that have laws that specify how the debtor may receivethe delinquency after acceleration by payment of less than the debt infull.One respondent commented that after an account is accelerated, loan servicingceases and that it was incumbent on the Agency to do everything possibleto assist the borrower to continue to operate. This comment was not adoptedbecause the Agency has determined, once an account has been accelerated,that Primary Loan Servicing Programs will not assist in the orderly collectionof debt and that acceleration of the account is necessary to protect theGovernment's interest. The Agency has, however, implemented that provisionof the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 which provides an opportunity forborrowers whose accounts were accelerated between November 1, 1985, andMay 7, 1987, to apply for the release of income from the sale of chattelsecurity and debt servicing relief. A few borrowers have requested releaseof income from the sale of chattel security and Loan Servicing Programs.Several comments were received objecting to the provision that the denialof an offer to stop foreclosure is not appealable because it violated provisionsof the Food Security Act of 1985, which requires that decisions that directlyand adversely affect a borrower be appealable. No change has been madein this provision because the Agency has determined that the borrower hasbeen given an opportunity to appeal FmHA's foreclosure action when theborrower was advised of FmHA's intent to accelerate the loan indebtedness.The Agency adopts the proposed rule. Several respondents commented on the proposed regulation addressing theuse of Supervised Bank Accounts to hold payments made on loan accountsthat have been accelerated, and that Supervised Bank Accounts should beinterest bearing. The Agency has considered those comments and has electednot to adopt this comment because of the differences in State Laws whichmay, in some cases, require the acceleration to be reversed. We have however,revised this section to clarify that payments will be accepted after accelerationand applied on the loan account unless State Laws would require the accelerationto be reversed. In those States where acceptance of payments after accelerationwould cause the acceleration to be reversed, the payments will not be accepted.In addition, each State is required to address in a State supplement theprovisions of State laws regarding the acceptance of payments after acceleration.In those States where accepting the payment after acceleration does notcause the acceleration to be reversed, FmHA will accept payments and applyit on the loan indebtedness.<T3>Section 1955.18_Action required after acquisition of property. </T3>TheAgency proposed changes in the section to address how and when the CountySupervisor is to notify previous owners and operators of Homestead Protectionrights. A respondent commented that this section should clearly state thatthe Homestead Protection Notice be sent certified mail. This comment hasbeen adopted. One respondent also commented that the decision to leaseor buy the property is the former owner's option, and that any decisionby FmHA regarding the availability of the property for sale should notdelay sending the notices, thus prohibiting a lease or purchase agreementto be entered into by the former owner within the 180-day period afterFmHA acquires the property. We have revised this section to clarify thatthe leaseback/buyback notices will be sent after FmHA acquires the propertyand that the County Supervisor will initially attempt to dispose of propertyin accordance with the leaseback/buyback program. Appropriate changes andrevisions have also been made to andSection; 1951.911(a) of Subpart S ofPart 1951 of this chapter, ``Leaseback/Buyback.'' Section 1951.911(a) allowsthe former owner the option to lease or purchase the property. This sectionalso advises the County Supervisor to notify the former owner of leaseback/buybackrights within 30 days of FmHA acquisition of the property.It also provides for 180 days or a longer period of applicable State Redemptionlaws provide for a longer timeframe to make application in writing. The180 day timeframe in which the former owner must enter into a lease orpurchase agreement has been removed. There were other respondents who requestedminor changes to Subpart A of Part 1955 as to grammar and clarificationof phrases which the Agency has adopted and has amended this subpart toreflect these changes, otherwise the proposed rule is adopted as proposed.<ITAG tagnum="81">PART 1955_PROPERTY MANAGEMENT </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart B_Management of Property </ITAG>This subpart prescribes the policy and procedures for the management ofreal and chattel property which is in FmHA inventory. This subpart alongwith Subpart C of Part 1955 contained the policy and procedures for FmHA'sLeaseback/Buyback and Homestead Protection Programs as mandated by theFood Security Act of 1985. The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 revisedthese programs and they became a part of Preservation Loan Service Programsas outlined in Exhibit I, ``Dwelling Retention,'' and Exhibit J, ``Leaseback/Buyback,''of proposed rule of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapter. In the interimrule of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapter, the Agency has deletedproposed Exhibits I and J and has incorporated the policy and proceduresfor Leaseback/Buyback in andSection; 1951.911(a) of Subpart S of Part 1951of this chapter and Homestead Protection (formerly referred to as DwellingRetention) in andSection; 1951.911(b) of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapter.In addition to the proposed rule published May 23, 1988 (53 FR 18392),as it relates to Farmer Programs loans in this subpart, the Agency publisheda proposed rule on April 2, 1988 (52 FR 10577), as it relates to FmHA'sHousing Programs. The April 2, 1988, proposed rule was adopted as a finalrule on July 25, 1988 (53 FR 27819). A number of proposed revisions asit relates to form numbers, reference changes, titled and/or clarity werepublished in both proposed rules. The Agency has adopted those proposedrevisions that were duplicated in the April 2, 1988, and May 23, 1988,proposed rules, in the final dated July 25, 1988 (53 FR 27819). No adversecomment were received on the May 23, 1988, proposed rule related to theserevisions. Since no adverse comments were received and the revisions havealready been published in final rule, no specific mention will be maderelated to those revisions in this interim rule, and they are not publishedhere. The comments on this Subpart are discussed as they apply to the specificsection.<T3>Section 1955.53_Definitions. </T3>The Agency proposed to revise thissection by adding or revising the definition of Indian Reservation, sociallydisadvantaged individual, and suitable property. Several respondents commentedthat the revised definition of suitable property for farm property is toorestrictive and that the suitability classification of property shouldnot be determined on whether or not FmHA could make a loan on the property.The Agency agrees with the suggestion and has revised its definition ofsuitable property for farm property to specifically state it is those farmlandproperties that can be used for general farming purposes. If the CountyCommittee determines that the farmland can be used for farming purposes,it will be classified suitable. Several respondents also commented on the definition of surplus propertyas it relates to suitable CONACT property which is not sold within 3 yearsafter acquisition and the concern that such property may not be availablefor sale as suitable property because it was withheld from market due toan adverse impact on farm real estate values or other administrative reasons.The Agency agrees with these comments and has revised this definition toallow for a period of time greater than 3 years if the property was withheldfrom the market because its sale may have had an adverse impact on farmreal estate values or other reasons such as statute changes and regulationrevisions.<T3>Section 1955.55_Taking abandoned real or chattel property into inventoryand related actions.</T3> The Agency proposed to revise this section todelete reference to Forms FmHA 1924-14, 1924-25 and 1924-26 and substitutereference to Attachments 1 and 2 of Exhibit A of Subpart S of Part 1951of this chapter. One respondent suggested that this section be revisedto clarify that Attachments 1 and 2 of Exhibit A be provided to the borrowerbefore any adverse action which includes requests for voluntary conveyance.The Agency believes this issue is properly addressed in Subpart S of Part1951 and Subpart A of Part 1955 of this chapter and no change will be madeto this section.<T3>Section 1955.63_Suitability Determination. </T3>The Agency proposedin this section to require the County Committee to determine the suitabilityof farmland and remove this authority from the County Supervisor. Also,this section was revised to establish guidelines for subdividing propertieslarger than family farm size. Other proposed revisions were made to thissection to correct a reference to FmHA Instruction 2024-A (available inany FmHA office) and to delete the reference to Multiple Family Housing(MFH). One respondent suggested that guidance be provided in reclassifyingproperty as surplus because of physical damage that occurs or changes ineconomic conditions that affect the suitability for program purposes. TheAgency agrees with this recommendation and has revised this section providingseveral examples of physical damage and changes in economic conditionswhich will affect the suitability of the property. One respondent commentedthat this section provides no guidance to the County Committee on reclassifyingproperty presently in FmHA's inventory. No change is being made in thissection to address this issue because it is the intention of the agencyto implement the reclassification of property presently in inventory byAdministrative Notice (AN) (available in any FmHA office). Guidance willbe provided by the AN instructing the County Committee to reclassify propertypresently in inventory in accordance with the suitability definition ofthis subpart.One respondent suggested that when FmHA is subdiving farm property whichhas been determined to be larger than a family farm size, that the Agencydivide the property into units for which the value does not exceed $200,000,the insured farm ownership loan limit. The Agency had proposed that thevalue of the subdivided parcel not to exceed $300,000, the guarantee farmownership loan limit. We agree with the recommendation and have adoptedthe $200,000 value for subdividing property.One respondent commented that the Agency clarify when FmHA acquires farmproperty and it is determined to be larger than family farm size, the previousowner has priority to purchase the entire farm. No changes have been madeto adopt this revision because this matter is addressed in andSection; 1951.911(a)of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapter which provides that it is FmHApolicy not to subdivide property larger than family farm size until theprevious owner, spouse and children of the previous owner entity members(if the previous owner was an entity) and the previous operator's rightshave expired.<T3>Section 1955.64_Securing, maintaining, and repairing inventory property.</T3>The Agency proposed to revise this section to provide for repairsto nonessential farm buildings or facilities if they are historic or ifa health or safety problem exists, to clarify what the County Supervisor'sresponsibilities are and what FmHA will request of the Soil ConservationService when dealing with highly erodible soil on farm property. An additionalproposed revision was to change the reference from FmHA Instruction 1955-Dto FmHA Instruction 2024-A (available in any FmHA office).No comments were received regarding these revisions and the Agency adoptsthe proposed rule as amended.<T3>Section 1955.66_Lease of real property. </T3>The Agency proposed inthis section to clarify the leasing of real property, address HomesteadProtection and Leaseback/Buyback programs, establish guidance for racialand ethnic considerations, clarify leasing priority, establish proceduresfor Leaseback/Buyback of property within an Indian Reservation and thatthe purchase price of inventory property will be the lower of its marketvalue or the capitalization value.Several respondents commented that the failure to meet all scheduled loanpayments in the past should not be a reflection of management skills whichmay make a prospective lessee ineligible to lease with an option to purchasethe farm. The Agency agrees that failure to meet all scheduled loan paymentsis not an eligibility criteria for Leaseback/Buyback. Management skillsis not eligibility criteria, but the County Supervisor must take into considerationthe prospective managment skills of the applicant to determine feasibilityof the plan and if the terms and conditions of the lease can be fulfilled.Section 1951.911 of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapter sets forth theeligibility criteria for applicants that have Leaseback/Buyback rights.Several comments were received that recommended FmHA enhance its effortto encourage minority participation in FmHA programs as it relates to leasingand purchasing FmHA inventory property. This issue is discussed in partin Subpart A of Part 1943 of this chapter. We have also revised SubpartC of Part 1955 of this chapter to address this issue by targeting suitableproperty for members of socially disadvantaged groups. Such property willbe advertised for sale by publishing, as a minimum, three consecutive weeklyannouncements at least twice annually, in at least one newspaper that iswidely circulated in the county in which the farm is located.Several respondents commented that the proposed rule suggested that FmHAwould transfer property to the Department of Interior only after the Agencydetermines that the tribe did not have financial resources to purchasethe property. We agree with the respondents and have deleted from thissection reference to the tribe's financial resources as a condition totransferring property to the Department of Interior.One respondent commented that entity members of an entity that formerlyowned land within the boundaries of an Indian Reservation were excludedin this section from having Leaseback/Buyback rights. The Leaseback/Buybackprovisions of andSection; 1951.911(a) of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapterprovide priority rights to the entity and entity members regardless ofwhether the property is located within the boundaries of an Indian Reservation.No revisions have been made to this section since this matter is addressedin andSection; 1951.911(a) of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapter.One respondent commented that lands owned by an Indian Tribe and financedby FmHA under the Indian Land Acquisition Loan Program are entitled toLeaseback/Buyback rights and may also be transferred to the Departmentof Interior if acquired by FmHA. The Agency has determined that the debtwrite-down authority and Leaseback/Buyback rights provision of the AgriculturalCredit Act of 1987 do not pertain to organization type loan borrowers,such as Indian Land Acquisition Loans and Grazing Association Loans; therefore,there is no authority to transfer property which may be acquired as a resultof an Indian Land Acquisition loan to the Department of Interior.This comment was not adopted and no revisions were made as a result ofthe comment.Several respondents commented that FmHA must offer property for sale atthe value that reflects the annual production of the land as provided inthe Food Security Act of 1985. The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 providesthe property be offered for sale for not less than market value. We agreewith the respondent that FmHA must consider the provisions of the FoodSecurity Act in determining the value of farm property. The value thatreflects the annual production of the land is determined by FmHA by completingan appraisal based on the prospective capitalization value. FmHA has adoptedthis recommendation by revising the regulation to reflect that the propertywill be officially for sale at the lower of the capitalization value ormarket value.Several comments were received suggesting that the lease term for Leaseback/Buybackshould be longer than one year. We agree with the comments and have revisedthis section to provide for individuals and entities that have Leaseback/Buybackrights in accordance with andSection; 1951.911 of Subpart S of Part 1951of this chapter to lease the property for terms from one to five years.The prospective lessee will determine the term of the lease.Several respondents commented that FmHA should maintain insurance on allinventory property to assure the previous owner will acquire the propertyin the same condition as when FmHA took it into inventory. FmHA, like therest of the Federal Government, is a self insurer and it would violatelong-standing Federal policy for FmHA to purchase insurance on inventoryproperties. The FmHA lease, Form FmHA 1955-20, contains a provision acknowledgingthat FmHA (lessor) does not have insurance on the property.This comment was not adopted and no revisions were made to this sectionrelated to this comment.<ITAG tagnum="81">PART 1955_PROPERTY MANAGEMENT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart C_Disposal of Inventory</ITAG>This subpart delegates authority and prescribes policies and proceduresfor sale of inventory property including real estate, related real estaterights, and chattels. It also covers the granting of easements and right-of-wayson inventory property.<T3>Section 1955.102_Policy. </T3>The Agency proposed no revisions to thissection, but did receive a comment that this section be clarified to insurethat an eligible applicant has an opportunity to purchase suitable inventoryproperty. The Agency has determined that there is sufficient guidance inother sections of this subpart that clarifies that eligible applicantsdo have an opportunity to purchase suitable inventory property. The Agencyadopts the proposed rule in the interim final rule.<T3>Section 1955.103_Definitions</T3>. The Agency proposed to revise thissection to define CONACT and CONACT property, Homestead Protection, FarmerProgram Loans, Leaseback/Buyback owner, previous operator and sociallydisadvantaged applicant and to redefine suitable property.One respondent commented on the need for additional clarification for thedefinitions of ``owner,'' by stating that in cases where the farmer isin a Chapter 11 bankruptcy and the farmer is also the trustee, that theLeaseback/Buyback and Homestead Protection rights are not rights that goto the bankruptcy estate. The Agency does not believe this definition needsclarification and adopts the proposed rule.One respondent commented that the definition of ``previous operator'' shouldinclude operators who were operating the farm while it was in FmHA's inventory,even though they may have not been the same operator at the time the farmwas taken into inventory. The statute requires that the Agency gives specialconsideration to only those operators that were the immediate previousfamily-size farm operators of such acquired property. All other operators,even those that might have leased the farm since it came into FmHA inventory,will have an equal opportunity to buy or lease with all other eligibleapplicants if the farm is not acquired under the leaseback/buyback provisions.The Agency adopts the proposed rule, along with minor changes in languageand additions in the interim rule.One respondent commented that in andSection; 1955.106(a) that a referenceshould be made to the appropriate FmHA regulations for the definition of``Indian Reservation.'' The Agency agrees that the change is necessaryand has amended this section to include the definition for ``Indian Reservation.''The Agency adopts this comment in this interim rule.Several respondents commented on the definition of suitable and surplusproperty. The Agency's response to these comments is addressed in SubpartB of Part 1955 of this chapter. The Agency agreed with the comments andhas adopted the change, along with minor changes in language and additionsin the interim rule.<T3>Section 1955.105_Real property affected (CONACT). </T3>The Agency proposedto revise this section to reference Leaseback/Buyback and Homestead Protection.No comments were received on this section, but in the interim final ruleFmHA has deleted Exhibits I and J of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapterand moved them to andSection; 1951.911 of Subpart S of Part 1951 of thischapter.<T3>Section 1955.105_Real property affected (CONACT). </T3>No commentswere received on this section, but in the final rule FmHA has deleted ExhibitsI and J of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapter.<T3>Section 1955.106_Disposition of farm property. </T3>The Agency revisedthis section to provide guidance on the rights of previous owner and notificationprovided for racial and ethnic considerations and address non-program loans.A comment was received regarding the need for a definition of Indian Reservation,and this has been added to andSection; 1955.103 of this subpart.<T3>Section 1955.107_Sale of suitable property (CONACT). </T3>The Agencyrevised this section to provide for advertising of inventory property,address the responsibility of the Indian Tribe council to notify partieseligible for Leaseback/Buyback, establishing the price for inventory propertyat the market value, delete reference to the capitalization value, clarifypreference criteria when two or more eligible applicants wish to purchasethe farm and other clarity changes.Several respondents commented that a reference to Indian Reservation isdefined in andSection; 1955.55 of Subpart B of Part 1955 of this chapterwhich is in error as the definition for Indian Reservation is found inandSection; 1955.53 of that subpart. These respondents suggested that clarificationis needed for the nontraditional Indian Reservation definition as theseare areas where there are not Indian Reservations but, under the Statelaw, the Indians have the same rights as if there was a reservation. Thisis particularly true in Oklahoma. The Agency agrees and has adopted thecomment in the interim rule for classification.Several respondents commented that the definition of ``price'' in andSection;1955.107(c) should be amended to clarify that for suitable land the pricefor purchase by family farm operators can be no more than a price thatreflects the annual production value of the property as a farming operation.The respondent went on to indicate that the Food Security Act of 1985 containeda prohibition against selling land at not more than actual production valueand this provision was not deleted. Thus, to be in compliance with boththe Food Security Act of 1985 and the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987,which allows the offering of suitable land at market value, FmHA must offerthe land at the lower of the two values. The Agency agrees and has amendedthis section to provide for the price of inventory farmland will be eitherthe market or the capitalization value whichever is less.One respondent commented that andSection; 1955.107(d)(3) should be clarifiedto insure that an applicant be properly notified if the interest rate changesbetween the time the loan is approved and the time it is closed. Section307 (7 U.S.C. 1927a), Loan programs, of the CONACT sets forth the requirementsthat the applicant must request the lower of the interest rates if theinterest rates change between loan approval and loan closing. The Agencyadopts this suggestion in the proposed interim rule.One respondent commented that andSection; 1955.107(d)(5)(i) only allows theuse of a quit claim or other forms of nonwarranty deeds. The commentorsuggested there is no justification for FmHA not using a warranty deedin credit sale situations. The Agency does not agree. The Anti-DeficiencyAct, 31 U.S.C. 1342, prohibits a Government official from entering intoa contract or obligation for the payment of money in excess of the amountavailable in an appropriation. A warranty deed contains covenants which,if breached, could subject the Government to contractual liability manyyears in the future, i.e., beyond any current appropriation. Due to theAnti-Deficiency Act, the Agency cannot adopt this suggestion.One respondent commented that andSection; 1955.107(e)(2) states that theCounty Committee will determine whether the purchaser of farmland inventorywill be, as of the time after the contract or lease is entered into, anoperator of not larger than a family-size farm. The respondent states thatFmHA should define the definition of family-size farms. The Agency believesthat the criteria set forth in the regulation provides the necessary guidanceto the County Committee for determining if the inventory property is afamily-size farm. Therefore, the Agency does not adopt the suggestion.A respondent commented that the regulations should be revised to remindthe County Committee that they must also comply with the priority considerationswhen there are two or more eligible operators. The respondent also feltthat once the 190-day period has passed the previous operator of the farmhad continual priority consideration over other family-size operators.The Agency does not agree that after the 190-day period that the previousoperator will continue indefinitely to have priority consideration overother family-size operators. The Agency believes that the statute allowsadministratively that once this period of time has expired then the otherfactors regarding priority come into play allowing the County Committeeto give priority and make a selection based on those items set forth inandSection; 1955.107(e)(2)(i), (ii) and (iii). The Agency does not acceptthe suggestion and adopts the proposed rule as published.One respondent commented that andSection;andSection; 1955.107(e)(2)(iii) and1955.108(b)(3) (i) through (iv) which would require the County Committeeto take into consideration, when selecting an eligible applicant for suitablefarmland property, an evaluation of the operator's past farm records. Thiswould include liquidity, solvency, profitability and efficiency ratios.The respondent felt that this requirement would be in violation of section621 of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 which would require the Agencyto conduct a study to show that the use of ratios and standards as partof a loan application would not result in a portfolio of borrowers thatis inconsistent with the purposes of the Consolidated Farm and Rural DevelopmentAct. The Agency agrees with this comment and has deleted the referenceto liquidity, solvency, profitability, and efficiency in the interim finalrule.<T3>Section 1955.108_Sale of surplus property (CONACT). </T3>The Agencyrevised this section to refer to Exhibit I and J of Subpart S of Part 1951of this chapter concerning Leaseback/Buyback and Homestead Protection andalso addresses that the suitable property will be classified as surplusafter 3 years. Exhibits I and J of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapteras proposed has been changed from exhibits and the policy and proceduresfor Leaseback/Buyback can now be found at andSection;1951.911(a) and HomesteadProtection (formerly referred to as Dwelling Retention) of andSection;1951.911(b)of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapter. One respondent commented that andSection;1955.108 should be amended to providefor a reference to the type of public advertising that must be done forpublic sale or auction sale. The respondent suggested there should be adescription of the time and period for publishing advertisements in newspapersas well as for posting advertisements. The Agency agrees and has incorporatedthis comment in the interim rule to provide for the advertising of surplusproperties twice a year for three consecutive weeks. <T3>Section 1955.122_Method of sale (Chattel). </T3>One respondent commentedthat this section should clarify that in certain States the original ownerof chattel property will be notified of the sale date and method of saleprior to the sales. The Agency agrees and has incorporated this commentin the interim final rule. <T3>Section 1955.123_Sale procedures (chattel). </T3>This section providesguidance on who is authorized to approve or disapprove credit sales. Nocomments were received on this section. The proposed rule is adopted. <T3>Section 1955.128_Appraisers. </T3>One respondent commented that thefee appraisers must include the market value of the property and the valuedetermined by the annual production value. The Agency agrees and has clarifiedthis section in the interim rule to insure that the appraisal reflectsboth market and capitalization values. <T3>Section 1955.129_Business brokers. </T3>This section provides guidanceon the authority to contract and use business brokers for the sale of businesses,as a whole, including goodwill and chattels. The Agency proposed no revisionsto this section and no comments were received. The proposed rule is adopted.<T3>Section 1955.130_Real estate broker. </T3>This section provides guidanceon the authority to contract and use real estate brokers to sell inventoryproperty. The Agency proposed no revisions to this section and no commentswere received. The proposed rule is adopted. <T3>Section 1955.131_Auctioneers. </T3>One respondent suggested that thecommission charged by an auctioneer should be considered when calculatingthe recovery costs for purposes of Primary Loan Service Programs. The methodof calculating recovery value is addressed in Exhibit I of Subpart S ofPart 1951 of this chapter. The Agency believes this is the proper placefor guidance to the field for those items which will be used in calculatingrecovery value. The Agency adopts the proposed rule. <T3>Section 1955.134_Loss, damage, or existing defects in inventory realestate property. </T3>One respondent commented that andSection;1955.134 shouldbe clarified to state that FmHA will maintain sufficient property insuranceto insure it against damage to farmland inventory. The Agency believesthe present regulations are sufficient as they provide for the reappraisalof the property, if the property is damaged as a result of fire, vandalism,or an Act of God. The reappraised value of the property will be the amountFmHA accepts from the purchaser. Because of long standing Federal policyapplicable to the entire Federal Government, FmHA does not carry propertyinsurance on inventory property. The Agency adopts the proposed rule. <T3>Section 1955.135_Taxes on inventory real property. </T3>One respondentcommented that andSection;1955.135 should be amended to clarify that duringthe time FmHA has the land in inventory, it will pay real estate taxeswhen due. The respondent went on to say that it was very important thattaxes be paid because of the need in rural communities for taxes to bepaid to cover the expense of the public services provided by property taxdollars. The Agency believes the regulations are sufficient since theyrequire FmHA to pay its proportionate share when the property is sold orwhen the tax is due. The Agency adopts the proposed rule. <T3>Section 1955.137_Real property located in special areas or having specialcharacteristics. </T3>The Agency revised this section to correct a referencebut received numerous comments on the Agency's policy and procedures regardingfloodplains, wetlands, conservation easements, highly erodible farmlandand historical preservation. Several respondents commented that deed restrictionsthe Agency is required to place on inventory properties that have floodplains,wetlands and highly erodible farmland should not be placed on propertyif it is being purchased by an applicant with leaseback/buyback rights.Property subject to leaseback/buyback is inventory property and as suchmust be covered by these deed restrictions. The Agency has no legal authorityto adopt this comment. One respondent commented that andSection;1955.137(c)(3) should be clarifiedwhen the sale of inventory property will be delayed when it is necessaryto have Soil Conservation Service (SCS) prepare conservation plans on theproperty prior to meeting the 180 or 190-day time period. The Agency agreeswith the comment and the timeframe has been revised to refer only to theperiod of time the previous borrower/owner must make application. No revisionshave been made to this section regarding this comment; however, andSection;1951.911of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapter has been revised to delete thereference to timeframe as to when a lease or purchase agreement must beentered into. The Agency adopts the rule and has incorporated the changes,along with other minor revisions in interim final rule. <T3>Section 1955.138_Property subject to redemption rights. </T3>The Agencyproposed no changes to this section but one respondent commented that thissection provided for FmHA's resale of inventory property subject to redemptionrights if state law permits this. The commentor suggested that this sectionbe amended to clarify that farmland inventory cannot be sold during theredemption period and that Leaseback/buyback rights ran consecutively.The Agency does not adopt this suggestion. The Agency has determined thatit was the intent of Congress that the redemption period and Leaseback/Buybackperiod run concurrently. The Agency adopts the rule as proposed. <T3>Section 1955.139_Disposition of real property rights. </T3>The Agencyreceived numerous comments on easements, rights-of-way, development rights,restrictions or equivalent thereof on FmHA inventory property. One respondentcommented that the Agency should clarify FmHA's affirmative responsibilityon the placement of conservation easements. Additional guidance and clarificationis added to this section as to the placement of conservation easementsupon a farm when FmHA has an affirmative responsibility to do so. No othercomments were adopted because the Agency has determined adequate guidanceis provided. The Agency adopts the proposed rule as changed. <T3>Section 1955.140_Scales in parcels. </T3>The Agency proposed no revisionsto this section but did receive comments regarding the subdividing of farminventory property larger than family size which are addressed in SubpartS of Part 1951 and Subpart B of Part 1955 of this chapter. To assure consistencebetween provisions in Subpart S of Part 1951 and Subpart B of Part 1955of this chapter and this section, the Agency has revised this section toprovide for the County Supervisor, based on recommendations of the CountyCommittee, to subdivide farm properties determined to be larger than family-size.This section has also been revised to provide for the County Supervisor,based on the recommendations of the County Committee, to group two or moreindividual farm properties into one suitable farm property, along withother minor changes in language and additions in the interim rule. <ITAG tagnum="87">PART 1962_PERSONAL PROPERTY </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart A_Servicing and Liquidation of Chattel Security </ITAG>This subpart delegates authorities and gives procedures for servicing,care, and liquidation of FmHA chattel security, Economic Opportunity (EO)loan property, and note-only loans. <T3>Section 1962.4_Definitions. </T3>This section has been revised to addthe definitions of normal income security and basic security as set forthin section 611 of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. <T3>Section 1962.17_Disposal of chattel security, use of proceeds and releaseof liens. </T3>This section states the conditions which the borrower mustaccount for all security and provides instructions by which the CountySupervisor will release FmHA's liens.   Respondents commented on the proposed regulation that in compliance withthe Act, FmHA must release proceeds from the sale of crops, livestock,and livestock products so that the borrower can pay essential family livingand farm operating expenses. Essential expenses are defined in andSection;1962.17. With regard to farm operating expenses there is a provision formachinery repair, farm building, and fence repair, etc. However, respondentsstated that the proposed rule contained provisions for capital expenditures.While capital expenditures are not always essential operating expenses,they sometimes are. If a farmer has a critical piece of machinery whichbreaks beyond repair, it is obviously an essential expense to replace thatpiece of machinery. To exclude replacement of essential machinery as anessential operating expense is to ignore reality. We agree and are revisingandSection; 1962.17 (b)(2)(ii). The State Director will be authorized toapprove the replacement of a piece of essential farm machinery which breaksbeyond repair.  T3Section 1962.17 (b)(2)(i). One respondent requested that the existingauthority to release basic security for essential family living and farmoperating expenses not be deleted. Section 611 of the Agricultural CreditAct of 1987 specifically delineates the meaning of both normal income securityand basic security and clearly requires that only normal income securityshall be released for essential household and farm operating expenses.Therefore, we believe that Congress did not intend that basic securitywould be released for such purposes. The Agency does not adopt this request. <T3>Section 1962.17 (b)(2)(ii).</T3> A respondent suggested that ExhibitE to Subpart A of FmHA Instruction 1962-A, titled ``Releasing SecuritySales Proceeds and Determining `Essential' Family Living and Farm OperatingExpenses,'' be published. The Agency agrees and will publish Exhibit E. <T3>Section 1962.27_Termination or satisfactory chattel security instrument.</T3>One respondent recommended the following addition to the languageof andSection; 1962.27(a)(3)(ii) as it relates to FmHA reaffirmation of aChapter 7 bankruptcy. The following modification to the last sentence shouldbe considered.<ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) If a Chapter 7 debtor wants to reaffirm the FmHA debt, FmHA mustaccept the reaffirmation; however, FmHA may refuse to allow the reaffirmationif the borrower has not acted in good faith pursuant to the provision ofandSection; 1951.909(a)(2).</ITAG>The Agency does not agree with this comment. Congress intended the Secretaryto take adverse action only in cases of proven fraud, proven waste, orproven conversion. Also, Congress did not intend to limit their intentjust to bankruptcy cases.  <T3>Section 1962.34(a)(2).</T3> A respondent suggested that the interestrate charged for the transfer of a loan to an eligible borrower be thelower of the two interest rates at the time of approval or closing. TheAgency cannot adopt this suggestion because section 307 (a) of the ConsolidatedFarm and Rural Development Act requires the borrower to choose the lowerinterest rate.  <T3>Section 1962.41_Sale of chattel security or EO property by borrowers.</T3>This section sets forth the procedures for voluntary liquidation of securityproperty through public or private sale.  One respondent commented on andSection; 1962.41(f) that this section doesnot include instructions on how borrowers will be notified of the releaseof liability. The commentor recommended the use of Form FmHA 1965-8, ``ReleaseFrom Personal Liability,'' to release the borrower of liability on a salefor less than the FmHA debt. The Agency agrees and has incorporated thechange, along with minor changes in language in the interim rule.  <T3>Section 1962.47_Bankruptcy and insolvency. </T3>This section sets forththe conditions which borrowers may apply and enter into agreements fordebt servicing before and after a bankruptcy dismissal.  Several respondents commented that FmHA should refuse to allow the reaffirmationof debt of borrowers dismissed in Chapter 7 bankruptcy who have not actedin good faith. The Agency believes that this is not necessary and prefersthat the State Director follow the advice of the Office of General Counselon how to handle such cases.  Interested parties should also see the Agency's response to comments concerningandSection; 1951.907 of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this Chapter. Paragraphs(c) and (d) have been added to andSection; 1951.907. The additions describethe servicing notices (if any) sent to the attorneys of borrowers who hadbankruptcy cases pending on January 6, 1988, the effective date of theAgricultural Credit Act of 1987 and before that date. As provided in theproposed rule at andSection; 1962.47(a)(3) and the same section of this interimrule, for bankruptcies filed after the effective date of the interim rule,FmHA will notify the attorney of these borrowers of the servicing options.The borrower will have the opportunity to apply for servicing if the requirementsof this rule are met. One respondent commented that FmHA should begin processingrequests for servicing so long as the borrower in bankruptcy has soughtrelief from the stay, but before the bankruptcy court has signed the order.Based on the comment and advice from regional legal counsel, FmHA has modifiedandSection;andSection; 1962.47(a)(3)(i) and 1962.47(a)(3)(ii) to state thatservicing negotiations can begin if the borrower provides FmHA with a filedcopy of a motion requesting relief from the stay in those jurisdictionswhere the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) has advised FmHA that thelocal jurisdiction does not sign orders granting limited relief from theautomatic stay. Conforming changes were also made to Exhibit D of thissubpart which informs the attorneys of borrowers filing bankruptcy howto apply for servicing.  The Agency has also added changes to andSection;andSection; 1962.47(c)(3) and1962.47(c)(4)(i). The change to andSection; 1962.47(c)(3) assures that servicingnotices will be sent prior to liquidation as required by the AgriculturalCredit Act of 1987. This change is the result of the advice of the Agency'slegal counsel.  The change to andSection; 1962.47(c)(4)(i) is also the result of advice fromthe Agency's legal counsel. Counsel advised that the Agency's previousrule concerning liquidations of Chapter 7 was inefficient. Bankruptcy Lawpermits a creditor to proceed prior to the discharge if the Governmentcan obtain an agreed order from the borrower and trustee abandoning theproperty and relief from the stay.<ITAG tagnum="81">PART 1965_REAL PROPERTY</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart A_Servicing of Real Estate Security for Farmer Program Loansand Certain Note-Only Cases  </ITAG>This Subpart delegates authority and prescribes policies and proceduresfor servicing real estate, leasehold interests and certain note only casesfor Farmer Program loans and nonprogram loans.  <T3>Section 1965.11_Preservation of security and protection of liens.</T3>Several respondents commented that the regulations should be revised toclarify that outstanding credit advances also include protective advances.We are revising andSection; 1965.11(c) to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Loans may be reamortized without regard to loan limits to includeprotective advance.

One respondent commented that andSection; 1965.12(a)(8) be changed to allowfor a subordination where the prior lien plus the FmHA debt exceeds thecurrent market value under certain conditions. The Agency believes thatthe proposed rule is adequate. When the FmHA indebtedness is not fullysecured by the market value of the security before the transaction a subordinationmay be granted if the market value of the total security will be increasedthrough improvement or acquisition by an amount at least equal to the additionaladvance.  Another respondent commented that the proposed rule should be revised toclarify that outstanding credit advances also include protective advances.The Agency has clarified the interim rule to state that the payment ofa prior lien is not a protective advance.

This value, generallyknown as capitalization value, is the amount that a prudent investor likelywould pay for the property based on its future earnings and advantages.The capitalization rate to be used in evaluation is most important. TheCounty Supervisor will calculate the capitalization rate from the comparablesales used to complete the appraisal. The formula for calculating the capitalizationrate is: Cap rate_Net Income/Selling Price. The following techniques canbe used to find the capitalization rate:(1) <T3>Rental income method.</T3> Capitalization of net rental income willtranslate farm rental earnings for use of land and buildings into a capitalizationrate. This method will reflect one that a typical operator would adoptfor the farm considering the development planned on Form FmHA 424-1. Therental income approach must be based on equitable rental terms. Studiesof lease terms in each area are important to establish a fairly definitepattern of prevailing rental terms. When farm tenancy in a community istoo low to determine typical rentals terms, the appraiser can use rentalterms for other comparable areas with similar properties in estimatingreturns for ownership of land and buildings. The rental income method ispreferred because rental income is not affected by the operator's managementability.(2) <T3>Earnings method.</T3> The earnings method is a detailed cash flow analysisof the comparables to determine their net incomes. The net income therebyobtained will reflect the rate of return to the investment in the farm.If the exact annual income can be ascertained from the owner/operator,a more precise capitalization rate can be determined. Several determinationsin this manner can provide a good indication of a reliable capitalizationrate. The appraiser must use caution that capitalization rates derivedin this manner reflect the typical operator and are not influenced by differencesin management abilities of the operators.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1902_SUPERVISED BANK ACCOUNTS</ITAG>4.

A feasible planis necessary if a loan is being made or a servicing action is being taken.A feasible plan is not necessary if the only reason for developing theplan is to complete a Form FmHA 1962-1 in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(iv)of this section. A feasible plan must indicate that all of the anticipatedcash farm and non-farm income equals or exceeds all the anticipated cashoutflows for the planned period. A feasible plan must show that a borrowerwill at least be able to:(i) Pay all operating expenses and all taxes which are due during the projectedfarm budget period.(ii) Meet necessary payments on all debts, except as provided in andSection;1941.14 of Subpart A of Part 1941 of this chapter, for annual productionloans made to delinquent borrowers.(iii) Provide living expenses for the family members of an individual borroweror a wage for the farm operator in the case of a cooperative, corporation,partnership, or joint operation borrower which is in accordance with theessential family needs.

A new Farm and Home Plan, or othersimilar plans of operation acceptable to FmHA, and a new Form FmHA 1962-1will be developed and completed for the upcoming year of operation priorto the expiration of the existing Form FmHA 1962-1. A list will be maintainedin the Management Systems Box in the Miscellaneous division in accordancewith andSection; 1905.5(d) of Subpart A of Part 1905 of this chapter (availablein any FmHA office). The list will include the borrower's name, the expirationdate of the form, and the date for the follow-up by the County Supervisor.(7) Verify that the plan is consistent with the applicable highly erodibleland and wetland conservation requirements of Exhibit M of Subpart G ofPart 1940 of this chapter.(d) <T3>Documentation and revision of plans. </T3>(1) Plans will be documentedin sufficient detail to adequately reflect the overall condition of theoperation, including the borrower's current financial condition. The borrower'sprojected income and expenses must be based on the borrower's proven recordof production and financial management. For existing farmers, actual productionand financial history for the past 5 years will be utilized. For thosewith less than a 5-year operating history, the applicant's available productionhistory will be used. This will be determined by the actual yields takenfrom the applicant's reliable records or the Agricultural Stabilizationand Conservation Service (ASCS) ``actual yields.'' When an accurate projectioncannot be made because the applicant's production history has been affectedby a disaster(s) declared by the President or designated by the Secretaryof Agriculture, and for those farmers who would have had a qualifying loss,as defined in andSection; 1945.154(a)(29) of Subpart D of Part 1945 of thischapter, but were not located in a designated/declared disaster area, Countyaverage yields will be used for the disaster year(s). If the applicant'sdisaster year's(s') yields are less than the County average yield, Countyaverage yields will be used for that year(s). If County average yieldsare not available, State average yields will be used. For beginning farmers,the County Supervisor will consider ASCS records, for that particular farm,Extension Service (ES) data, County averages, State averages, or otherreliable sources of data to develop the projections.(2) Unit prices for all agriculture commodities produced commercially ineach State will be established on a statewide basis by all FmHA State Directorseach year, and published in a State supplement to be issued annually tocomply with the farm planning season. State Directors may establish regionalunit prices for different regions of a State when there are transportationcosts and other factors that establish a regional pattern for unit priceswithin the State. In development of unit prices, the State Director willconsult with other agricultural agency representatives and agriculturallenders for the State and local areas before establishing commodity prices.State Directors in adjoining states will consult each other and will resolveany differences before releasing their established commodity price lists.Farmers who have proven accurate records to support a premium price fora commodity and/or contracts with well established markets will be allowedto use these prices. In addition, the supplement required in this sectionfor commodity prices will also contain the 5-year history of disaster declarations/designationsfor all counties in the State, indicating the type of disaster(s) and incidenceperiod(s). This information will be used to determine whether any particularyear(s) should be considered as a disaster year for the applicant.(3) Form FmHA 1962-1 will be revised whenever changes in the borrower'soperation occur during the year. It is the borrower's responsibility tonotify FmHA of any changes which occur. The Form FmHA 1962-1 will be marked``Revision'' and changes noted by crossing out any original estimates andinserting new estimates immediately above. The borrower and the CountySupervisor will initial and date revisions to the Form FmHA 1962-1. Also,if the changes would result in a major change in the operation, a new farmplan must be developed. If the borrower and the County Supervisor cannotagree on a revision, the borrower will be given the opportunity to appealin accordance with Subpart B of Part 1900 and andSection; 1962.17(a)(2) ofSubpart A of Part 1962 of this chapter. The notice to the borrower mustidentify the items on which the County Supervisor and the borrower cannotagree and must explain why the County Supervisor does not agree with theborrower's planned use of proceeds. While any appeal is pending, FmHA <T3>must </T3>make releases which would be average for the borrower foressential family living and farm operating expenses. Those borrowers whoserequests are in excess of their average essential family living and/orfarm operating expenses must provide justification in writing which willbe documented in the case file and if justified FmHA will approve the release.In addition, FmHA <T3>must </T3>make releases for other items on which the borrower and theCounty Supervisor agree. After the appeal is concluded, the County Supervisorand borrower will sign a Form FmHA 1962-1 which complies with the hearing(or any review) officer's decision. If the borrower refuses, the CountySupervisor will give the borrower a copy of the form and will explain thatit is considered binding by FmHA. Borrowers who do not abide by the formwill be handled under andSection; 1962.18 of Subpart A of Part 1962 of thischapter. If the borrower does not appeal, the County Supervisor will mailthe borrower a copy of the completed form along with a cover letter explainingthat FmHA considers the planned releases documented in Form FmHA 1962-1binding.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1924.58</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Recordkeeping.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Purpose. </T3>All borrowers engaged in farming must maintain and usefarm records which after the loan is made will enable:(1) Borrowers to make management decisions and to analyze their farmingoperations.(2) FmHA to determine eligibility for loan assistance, to analyze borrowers'farming operations, and to determine whether borrowers have made prudentmanagement decisions.(b) <T3>Responsibilities. </T3>(1) Borrowers must select and are required tomaintain a recordkeeping system which provides, as a minimum, a recordof cash receipts and expenditures, end of year balance sheets, and an incomestatement. Borrowers receiving EM loans of $100,000 or more will be requiredto use a recordkeeping system or accounting service which provides, asa minimum, a monthly cash flow statement, a change in financial positionstatement, beginning and end of year balance sheets, and an income statement.Such borrowers will be encouraged to use a computer recordkeeping systemwhen available.(2) County Supervisors will determine and document in the running recordwhether borrowers have selected, established, and are maintaining the requiredrecordkeeping systems. For those borrowers who are unable to maintain arecordkeeping system, the County Supervisor will assist and provide guidancein helping these borrowers to develop, understand and utilize records.Such systems may include the farm record book available through FmHA (FormFmHA 432-1, ``Farm Family Record Book''), other record books, or a suitablesystem offered by a farm management service, State Extension Service, orcommercial recordkeeping or accounting service, which is acceptable toFmHA.(3) Failure of a borrower to maintain the required records will be causefor FmHA to reject a borrower for further financial assistance. Borrowerscan also be denied loan servicing programs if the borrower has been previouslyadvised in writing by the County Supervisor that the borrower is not keepingadequate records.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1924.59</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Supervision.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Purpose. </T3>Supervision will be given by the County Supervisor toprotect the government's interest and to accomplish the purpose of theloan.(b) <T3>Responsibility of County Supervisor. </T3>The County Supervisor willdetermine and select the appropriate method of supervision to be used foreach borrower.(c) <T3>Supervisory Methods. </T3>Supervision may be given through farm visits,review of farm records, collateral inspections, meetings with borrowerson an individual or group basis, letters, telephone, etc. A complete recordof each visit, meeting, or other contact will be made in the case filerunning record, underscoring those items which require follow-up action.The record must state the advice that was given and any problems noted.(d) <T3>Farm visits. </T3>A minimum of one visit a year will be made by theCounty Supervisor or designee to borrowers who have been indebted for lessthan one full crop year, who have a limited resource loan, who have beensent Exhibit A of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapter or who have hadtheir loans reamortized, rescheduled, consolidated, written down and/ordeferred.

Specifically, analyses areused to:(1) Show the operator the cost or profit of a management decision. Thesefigures can then be used to make other management decisions that will increasethe efficiency and/or profitability of the operation.(2) Assist the operator in determining whether the type and scope of theoperation are practical and profitable.(3) Determine success in key management practices resulting in an improvedreturn; or revealing a decision that reduces net dollar return.(4) Monitor progress of borrowers in achieving long-range goals and ingraduating to other credit.(5) Help the County Supervisor determine how much individual supervisionwill be required for each borrower. The analysis will also help the CountySupervisor determine feasibility of continuing with a borrower. (6) Help the borrower and the County Supervisor prepare an annual planof operation for the next crop year and help them make sound managementdecisions.(7) Determine what servicing actions are needed to develop a feasible plan(b) <T3>Items considered for making an analysis. </T3>The following are someof the items that should be considered during an analysis:(1) Resources available to the borrower. (2) Options for types of enterprises available for the operation such ascorn vs. soybeans, selling the crop vs. feeding it to livestock, etc.(3) Comparison of the production of livestock, livestock products or cropsto past production.(4) The production of this farming operation as compared to similar farmingoperations in the area.

You will also need to list thosebuyers who you plan to sell your farm products to. This plan will giveyou and FmHA a clear idea of what income you expect from your operationand how those proceeds will be used. The plan will set forth the amountof money required for paying essential family living and farm operatingexpenses. You and FmHA must agree on how much money will be released fromyour crop proceeds.

If an applicant does not indicate a choice,the loan will be closed at the interest rate in effect at the time of loanapproval. Interest rates are specified in Exhibit B of FmHA Instruction440.1 (available in any FmHA office) for the type of assistance involved.A lower rate may be established for a limited resource applicant subjectto the following: (1) An applicant will receive the lower rate provided: (i) The applicant meets the conditions of the definition for a limitedresource applicant set forth in andSection; 1941.4 of this subpart. (ii) The Farm and Home Plan and/or Nonagricultural Enterprise Analysis,when appropriate, indicates that installments at the higher rate, alongwith other debts, cannot be paid during the period of the plan. (2) A borrower with Limited Resource interest rates will be reviewed eachyear at the time the analysis is conducted (see andSection; 1924.60 of SubpartB of Part 1924 of this chapter) and at any time a servicing action suchas consolidation, rescheduling or deferral is taken to determine what interestrate should be charged. The rate may be increased in increments of wholenumbers until it reaches the current regular interest rate for the loanat the time of the rate increase. (See andSection; 1951.25 of Subpart A ofPart 1951 of this chapter.) (b) <T3>Terms. </T3>(1) The final maturity date for each loan cannot exceed7 years from the date of the promissory note. (2) Loan funds used to pay annual operating expenses or bills incurredfor such purposes for the crop year being financed will normally be scheduledfor payment within 12 months from the date the loan is closed or when theincome from the operation is expected. Individual circumstances may warrantrepayment schedules which are longer than 12 months. Such factors as establishinga new enterprise, developing a farm, purchasing feed while feed crops arebeing established, marketing plans, or during recovery from a disasteror economic reverses, can be considered as reasons for a longer repaymentperiod on loans for annual operating purposes. When longer than normalrepayment terms are used for annual operating purposes, crops and/or livestockproduced for sale will not be considered sufficient security. The CountySupervisor may use Form FmHA 440-9, ``Supplementary Payment Agreement,''for borrowers who receive substantial income from which payment is to bemade before their installment due date. (3) Advances for purposes other than annual operating expenses will berescheduled for payment over the minimum period necessary considering theapplicant's ability to pay and the useful life of the security, but notin excess of 7 years. (4) When conditions warrant, installment scheduled in accordance with paragraph(b)(2) of this section may include equal, unequal, or balloon installments.In each case warranting balloon installments, there must be adequate collateralfor the loan at the time the balloon payment is due. Circumstances whichwarrant balloon installments are factors such as establishing a new enterprise,developing a farm, purchasing feed while crops are being established orduring recovery from a disaster, or economic reverses. In <T3>no case </T3>will annual crops be used as the sole collateral securinga balloon installment. A loan with a balloon installment must be adequatelysecured by hard security, which may include foundation stock, farm equipmentand/or real estate. The amount of the balloon installment should not exceedthat which the borrower could reasonably expect to pay during a maximumadditional 7-year period. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1941.19 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Security. </ITAG>Security must be adequate to assure repayment of the loan. The loan mustbe secured by a first lien on all property or products acquired, produced,or refinanced with loan funds and by any additional security needed. Suchadditional security may consist of the best lien obtainable on chattels,real estate or other property. In unusual cases, the loan approval officialmay require a cosigner as defined in andSection; 1910.3(d) of Subpart A ofPart 1910 of this chapter or a pledge of security from someone other thanthe borrower(s). Generally, a pledge of security is preferable to a cosigner.Loans may be subordinated to another lender in accordance with andSection;1962.30 of Subpart A of Part 1962 of this chapter when the subordinationwill help the borrower to accomplish the objectives of the loan. (a) <T3>Exceptions. </T3>(1) A lien will not be taken on property that cannotbe made subject to a valid lien. (2) A lien will not be taken on subsistence livestock, household goods,and small tools and small equipment, such as hand tools, power lawn mowers,and other items of like type not needed for security purposes. (3) When title to a livestock or crop enterprise is held by a contractorunder a written contract or the enterprise is to be managed by the applicantunder a share lease or share agreement, an assignment of all or part ofthe applicant's share of the income will be taken. A form approved by OGCwill be used to obtain the assignment. (4) A lien will not be taken on timber or the marginal land for a loanfor planting softwood timber trees on marginal land in conjunction witha softwood timber (ST) loan. (b) <T3>Real estate. </T3>The loan approval official may require a lien onall or part of the applicant's real estate as security. When the amountof the loan exceeds the equity in chattel security by more than $10,000,the best lien obtainable will be taken on real estate having sufficientcollateral equity to fully secure the loan(s) being made. Different lienpositions on real estate are considered separate and identifiable collateral.Real estate security may be taken for a portion of a loan when a separateadvance and promissory note evidences such portion. Form FmHA 427-1 (State),``Real Estate Mortgage for <T2>XXX</T2>,'' will be used to obtain such a lien, unless a State supplementrequires a different form. (c) <T3>Assignment on income in Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) States. </T3>TheCounty Supervisor will determine whether or not such an assignment willbe taken. In UCC States, an assignment of livestock or crop income constitutesa security agreement on income. The share lease, share agreement, or contractwill be described specifically as ``Contract Rights'' or ``Contract Rightsin Livestock or Crops,'' (or as ``Accounts'' or ``Accounts in Livestockor Crops,'' if required by a State supplement), and so forth, in paragraph1(b) of the financing statement. (d) <T3>Insurance. </T3>See andSection; 1941.88 of Subpart B of this part forinsurance requirements. (e) <T3>Special security requirements. </T3>When OL loans are made to eligibleentities that consist of members, stockholders, partners or joint operatorswho are presently indebted for an OL loan(s) as individual(s), or whenOL loans are made to eligible individuals who are members, stockholders,partners, or joint operators of an entity which is presently indebted foran OL loan(s), security must consist of: (1) Chattel and/or real estate security that is separate and identifiablefrom the security pledged to FmHA for any other farmer programs insuredor guaranteed loan(s). (2) Different lien positions on real estate are considered separate andidentifiable collateral. (3) The outstanding amount of loans made may not exceed the value of thecollateral used. (f) <T3>Income from products and program payments. </T3>Assignments, consentsand security interests relating to income from products and program paymentswill be used when necessary to protect FmHA's interest as follows: (1) Form FmHA 441-8, ``Assignment of Proceeds from the Sale of AgriculturalProducts,'' for products or income in which FmHA does not have a securityinterest under UCC. Other forms approved by OGC may be used when this formis not adequate. (2) Form FmHA 441-8, ``Consent to Payment of Proceeds from Sale of FarmProducts,'' for products or income, except dairy products in which FmHAhas a security interest under UCC. (3) Form FmHA 441-25, ``Assignment of Proceeds from the Sale of Dairy Productsand Release of Security Interest,'' for dairy products in which FmHA hasa security interest under UCC. (4) Forms provided by ASCS will be used for assignment of incentive andother agricultural program payments. (5) A security interest on income from products and ASCS incentive andother agricultural program payments. (g) <T3>Fixtures. </T3>A security interest may be taken in fixtures. An itemis generally considered a fixture if it is attached to a building or otherstructure or to land in such a way that it cannot be removed without defacingor dismantling the structure, or substantially damaging the item itself.When determined necessary by OGC, a State supplement will be issued tofurther explain the taking of a security interest in fixtures. (1) A security interest taken in goods <T3>before </T3>they become fixtures has priority over real estate interestholders.  (2) A security interest taken in goods <T3>after </T3>they become fixtures is valid against all persons subsequentlyacquiring an interest in the real estate. However, it is not valid againstpersons who had an interest in the real estate when the goods became fixtures,unless they execute Form FmHA 440-26, ``Consent and Subordination Agreement,''or Form FmHA 440-65, ``Severance Agreement.''(h) <T3>Milkbase and grazing permits. </T3>The advice of OGC will be obtainedas to how to perfect a security interest when these items are financedor taken as security.(i) <T3>Stock in cooperative associations. </T3>Loans only for the acquisitionof memberships or the purchase of stock in cooperative associations maybe made on the basis of the borrower's promissory note without taking securityexcept as follows: (1) An assignment, pledge, or other security interest in stock or otherevidence of membership will be obtained, provided the security interesthas value to FmHA. A security interest also may be taken in dividends tobe paid on stock, memberships, or patronage, or in undivided profits andother retainages. The security interest will be in the form of an assignment,pledge, or other instrument and will be taken on forms and in the mannerapproved by the OGC. Stock certificates and similar collateral will bekept in the County Office. A notation will be made on Form FmHA 1905-1,``Management System Card_Individual,'' showing that such security has beenretained.(2) In individual cases, loan approval officials may require a lien oncrops or chattels as security for a loan made for the acquisition of amembership or stock if they determine that such action is necessary toprotect the FmHA interest.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;andSection; 1941.20-1941.22 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1941.23 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General provisions.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Compliance requirements. </T3>The following will apply as appropriate:(1) Environmental assessments and statements.

The necessarybuildings will be located on the applicant's farm. Exceptions of this requirementare when:(i) The applicant already owns an adequate, decent, safe, and sanitarydwelling, suitable for the family's needs, and located close enough tothe farm so the farm may be operated successfully, it will not be necessaryto provide a dwelling on the farm. A real estate lien will be taken onsuch a dwelling.(ii) The applicant has a long-term lease on acceptable rented buildingsthat are adjacent to or near the farm, or the applicant occupies suitablebuildings which the applicant will eventually inherit or be permitted topurchase from a relative.(iii) The farm does not have an adequate dwelling and the applicant ownsa suitable mobile home which will be used as the applicant's home, theapplicant will not be required to build a dwelling. A mobile home willnot be considered to add value to the farm but FO funds may be used tofinance anchoring the home.(iv) A nonfarm enterprise facility does not have to be physically locatedon the farm.(2) When loan funds are needed for a dwelling and an applicant is eligiblefor a Rural Housing (RH) loan, it will be processed simultaneously withthe FO loan. However, in such cases if a small amount is needed for dwellingimprovements, FO funds may be used. Dwellings financed with RH funds willmeet the requirements for such loans as provided in Subpart A of Part 1944of this chapter.(c) <T3>Land and facility development.</T3> Development needed to make thefarm and any nonfarm enterprise ready for a successful operation will beplanned during loan processing. The plans should provide for completingthe development at the earliest practicable date. Recommendations of representativesof the Forest Service, Soil Conservation Service, State Agricultural ExtensionService, and State Planning and Development Agency or local planning groupsshould be included in the development plan and the Farm and Home Plan.In planning such development with the applicant, the County Supervisorwill encourage the applicant to use any cost-sharing assistance that maybe available through any source such as the Agricultural Stabilizationand Conservation Service (ASCS) programs.(d) <T3>Insurance.</T3> (1) Insurance will be obtained on buildings and otherproperty as provided in Subpart A of Part 1806 of this chapter (FmHA Instruction426.1).(2) See andSection; 1943.23(a) of this subpart for information about mudslideand flood insurance.(3) Applicants receiving loans for nonfarm enterprises will be advisedof the possibility of incurring liability and will be encouraged to obtainpublic liability and property damage insurance.(4) Personal property insurance will be obtained to insure against chattelsecurity losses caused by hazards customarily insured against in the areaif the loss of such security would jeopardize the interests of the Government.(e) <T3>Income from other than owned acreage.</T3> When loan soundness dependson income from other sources in addition to income from owned land, itwill be necessary to determine that:(1) There is reasonable assurance that any rented land which the applicantdepends on will be available; and/or(2) Any off-farm employment the applicant depends on is likely to continue.(f) <T3>Income from nonfarm enterprises.</T3> Nonfarm enterprises will be analyzedto determine soundness.(1) Form FmHA 431-4, ``Business Analysis_Nonagricultural Enterprise,''will be used to document nonfarm enterprises unless the applicant usesanother suitable form.(2) The net cash income from the nonfarm enterprise will be entered asnonfarm income in the Farm and Home Plan.(g) <T3>Other real estate and assets.</T3> Other assets not used directly inthe farming operation will be handled as follows:(1) FO loans may be made when essential real estate is owned, either inwhole or as an undivided interest, that will not be part of the farm provided:(i) The real estate or interests therein furnish employment or income whichis essential to the applicant's success.(ii) Sale of the property will not eliminate the need for FmHA credit.(iii) Retention of the real estate will not cause the operation to be largerthan a family farm. (2) An applicant will dispose of nonessential real estate or an undividedinterest in real estate no later than loan closing. If this is not feasible,the applicant must agree by signing Form FmHA 443-17, ``Agreement to SellNonessential Real Estate,'' to dispose of the property as soon after closingas possible. Under no circumstances may the property be held for more thanthree years after closing. (3) The applicant must agree to use the proceeds from the sale of otherreal estate to: (i) Pay costs and taxes connected with the sale; (ii) Reduce the FmHA debt or any prior lien; (iii) Make essential capital purchases; or (iv) Pay essential farm and home expense.

However, if the borrower's residence is not situatedon the farm, the FO loan will be serviced by the County Office servingthe county in which the farm or a major portion of the farm is locatedunless otherwise approved by the State Director. (j) <T3>Subdivision of large tracts of farmland, other than FmHA inventoryfarms, into family farm units. </T3>County Supervisors should investigateany large tract that is offered for sale to determine the feasibility ofmaking FO loans to enable several applicants to acquire the tract. In consideringthe feasibility of a tract for subdivision into family farms, the followingare some of the factors that must be considered: (1) Productivity of the land and its suitability for operation as a familyfarm; (2) Cost of the land and improvements; (3) Accessibility to roads, markets, schools, right-of-way, easements,and other services. (4) Disposition or omisson of any part of the tract that is not suitable;and (5) The number of eligible applicants in the area.

(1) <T3>Graduation of FO borrowers.</T3> If, at any time, it appears that theborrower may be able to obtain a refinancing loan from a cooperative orprivate credit source at reasonable rates and terms, comparable to thosefor loans for similar purposes and periods of time prevailing in the area,the borrower will, upon request, apply for and accept such financing. Aborrower paying a rate of interest less than the market rate wil be expectedto pay the current rate when able to do so. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1943.25 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Options, planning and appraisals</ITAG>. (a) <T3>Optioning land. </T3>an applicant is responsible for obtaining optionson real property bought. Form FmHA 440-34, ``Option to Purchase Real Property,''should be used if possible.

When another lender willnot make a loan for the total needs of the applicant but is willing toparticipate with an FO loan, consideration will be given to a participationloan. FmHA employees may not guarantee, personally or for FmHA, repaymentof advances made from other credit sources. However, lenders may be assuredthat lien priorities will be recognized. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1943.28 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">FmHA loans simultaneous with other lenders. </ITAG>(a) Subpart R of Part 2000 of this chapter, ``Memorandum of UnderstandingFHA-FCA,'' (available in any FmHA office) will serve as a guide in processingFO loans to be made simultaneously with loans by FLB to a common applicant.State Directors may work out agreements for simultaneous loans with long-termlenders other than FLBs for eligible loan purposes. Such an agreement shouldprohibit future advances by the first mortgage holder except for taxes,property insurance, reasonable maintenance expenditures, and reasonableforeclosure costs, but should not prohibit subsequent FmHA loans. It shouldalso cover items such as appraisal methods, title clearances, loan closing,the disbursement of funds and, when appropriate, advance notice of foreclosure.It may also cover other items considered necessary or advisable for a soundFmHA junior lien loan. (b) The County Supervisor and the other lender's representative shouldmaintain a close working relationship in processing loans to a mutual applicantor borrower. When an FO loan is made at the same time as a loan from anotherlender, that lender's lien will have priority over the FmHA lien unlessotherwise agreed upon. The lender's lien priority can cover the followingin addition to principal and interest: advances for payment of taxes, propertyinsurance, reasonable maintenance to protect the security, and reasonableforeclosure costs including attorney's fees. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1943.29 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Relationship with other FmHA loans, insured and guaranteed. </ITAG>(a) Insured FO loans may be made simultaneously with other FmHA loans,and to borrowers presently indebted to FmHA, when the loan limits will<T3>not</T3> be exceeded and all requirements of the loans involved willbe met. (b) An insured FO loan may be made to a borrower with an outstanding guaranteedFO, SW, or RL loan when: (1) The total insured and guaranteed FO, SW and RL principal balance, includingthe new loan, owed by the loan applicant does not exceed $300,000 at loanclosing. (2) For entity applicants who qualify as per andSection; 1943.12(b)(4) ofthis subpart and have outstanding FO, SW, and RL loans as individuals,the total insured and/or guaranteed FO, SW, and RL principal balance, includingthe new loan request by the entity applicant, can never exceed the differencebetween what the total combination the individual members are entitledto and the total combination of the outstanding principal balance the individualmembers owe at loan closing. Example: Three brothers each have individualFO, SW, and RL loans totaling $750,000. The maximum amount the brothers,as individuals, are entitled to is $900,000. The maximum loan availableto the entity is $150,000, which is the difference between the $900,000and the $750,000. (3) Different lien positions on real estate are considered separate andidentifiable collateral. (4) All other requirements of the loan are met. (c) New applicants and borrowers indebted to FmHA and/or and FmHA guaranteedlender(s) for an EE loan may be considered for an FO loan(s) provided theirtotal outstanding principal indebtness to FmHA and/or the FmHA guaranteedlender(s) for the EE and any SW, RL OL and FO loans will not exceed $650,000.(d) A borrower may use the same collateral to secure two or more loans,insured or guaranteed, under this subpart except that the outstanding amountof such loans may not exceed the total value of the collateral so used.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1943.30 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">County Committee certification.</ITAG>The County Committee will certify that an applicant is eligible on FormFmHA 440-2, ``County Committee Certification or Recommendation,'' beforea loan is approved.

(b) <T3>Real estate security. </T3>(1) A mortgage will be taken on the entirefarm to be improved which is owned by the applicant, including land inwhich the applicant owns an undivided interest, except a portion of thefarm will be excluded when:  (i) The applicant's title to that part of the farm is defective, and cannotbe cured at a reasonable cost, provided:  (A) The Office of the General Counsel (OGC) determines that the applicant'sinterest is of such nature that it is not mortgageable; and  (B) To include the land would complicate loan servicing or liquidation;and  (C) Any land on which title is defective will not be included in the appraisalof the farm whether or not it is described on the mortgage.  (D) State law prohibits taking a lien on homestead property, except forthe purchase money of that property and financing improvements and theState Director has issued a State supplement exempting taking a lien onhomestead property where purchase money or improvements are not involved. (ii) The present lienholder on that part of the farm will not permit ajunior lien or State law will not recognize or permit a lien provided: (A) The part excluded from the security is not included in the apraisalreport; and  (B) OGC advice is obtained before excluding any real estate from the securityor the conditions under which real estate can be excluded are outlinedby a State supplement.  (iii) Soundness of the loan will not be affected if there is defectivetitle or part of the farm is not included as security.  (iv) An SW loan is made just to finance construction of an alcohol or methanegas facility, a lien will be taken on the facility and sufficient otherproperty to adequately secure the loan, even though a majority of the productsare used on the farm. In these situations, a lien need not be taken onthe entire farm when it is not needed to secure the loan. When the securityis so located that legal right-of-way to the property is not available,an easement or agreement will be obtained providing for right of ingressand egress.  (2) When the farm alone will not provide enough security, other real estateowned by the applicant may also be taken as security.  (3) Loans may be secured by a junior lien on real estate provided:  (i) Prior lien instruments do not contain provisions for future advances(except for taxes, insurance, other costs needed to protect the security,or reasonable foreclosure costs), cancellation, summary forfeiture, orother clauses that may jeopardize the Government's interest or the applicant'sability to pay the SW loan unless any such undesirable provisions are limited,modified, waived or subordinated insofar as the Government is concerned. (ii) Agreements are obtained from prior lienholders to give notice of foreclosureto FmHA whenever State law or other arrangements do not require such anotice. Any agreements needed will be obtained as provided in Part 1807of this chapter (FmHA Instruction 427.1). (4) The designated attorney, title insurance company, or OGC will furnishadvice on obtaining security when a life estate is involved.  (5) Any loan of $10,000 or less may be secured by the best lien obtainablewithout title clearance or legal services as required in Part 1807 of thischapter (FmHA Instruction 427.1), provided the County Supervisor believesfrom a search of the county records that the applicant can give mortgageon the farm. This exception to title clearance will not apply when: (i) The loan is made simultaneously with that of another lender.  (ii) This provision conflicts with program regulations of any other FmHAloan being made simultaneously with the SW loan.  (6) The Departments of Agriculture and Interior have agreed that FmHA loansmay be made to Indians and secured by real estate when title is held intrust or restricted status. When security is taken on real estate heldin trust or restricted status:  (i) The applicant will request the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to furnishTitle Status Reports to the County Supervisor.  (ii) BIA approval will be obtained on the mortgage after it has been signedby the applicant and any other party whose signature is required.  (c) <T3>Chattel security. </T3>Loans may be secured by chattels subject tothe following conditions:  (1) Real estate security is inadequate to secure the loan or is not availableat all. (2) Taking a lien on chattels will not prevent the borrower from obtainingoperating credit from other sources or the FmHA. (3) Junior liens on chattels may be taken when there is enough equity inthe property. However, when practical, a first lien on selected chattelitems should be obtained. (4) A first lien will be taken on equipment or fixtures bought with loanfunds whenever such property cannot be included in the real estate lienand this additional security is needed to secure the loan. (5) When a loan is made only for the purchase of shares of water stock,such stock will be pledged or assigned as security for the loan. No othersecurity need by required if the stock represents the right to receivewater and is transferrable separately from the land, provided: (i) There is a market for the stock. (ii) The purchase price is no greater than the price at which stock inthe water company is normally sold. (6) If secured by chattels only, the loan cannot be over $100,000 and mustbe scheduled for repayment within 20 years or the useful life of the security,whichever is less. (7) Chattel security will be obtained and kept effective as notice to thirdparties as provided in Subpart A of Part 1962 and Subpart B of Part 1941of this chapter. (d) <T3>Other security. </T3>(1) Items such as land, buildings, fixtures, fences,water, water stock and facilities, other improvements, easements, rightsof way, and other appurtenances that are considered part of the farm andusually pass with the farm in a change of ownership may be taken as additionalsecurity when needed. If any of these do not pass with a change of ownership,the County Supervisor will obtain advice from the designated attorney,title insurance company or OGC to properly identify such items and includethem in an appropriate security instrument or assignment. (2) Other property that cannot be converted to cash without jeopardizingthe borrower's farm operation may be taken as additional security whenneeded. Examples of such security may include cash value of insurance policies,stock, memberships or stock in associations or water stocks. Any propertytaken as additional security must have security value and be transferable.Advice will be obtained from the designated attorney, title insurance companyor the OGC on obtaining this security or assignment. (e) <T3>Loans secured by leaseholds. </T3>A loan may be secured by a mortgageon the leasehold if it has negotiable value and is able to be mortgaged,subject to the following: (1) The unexpired term of the lease should extend beyond the repaymentperiod of the loan for a period sufficient to ensure the objectives ofthe loan will be achieved. If the loan repayment period is equal to orgreater than the period covered by the lease, the borrower must provideother security to secure the loan or the lessor must agree in writing tocompensate the borrower for any unexhausted value of the improvements whenthe lease expires or is terminated. (2) The lessor must have good and marketable title to the real estate,which may be subject to a prior lien, or the lessor must have signed acontract to purchase the real estate. The contract to sell and the lieninstruments must not contain covenants, such as short redemption periodsor rights to cancel, which may jeopardize the Government's security. Anyprovisions which may jeopardize the Government's security must be limited,modified, waived or subordinated in favor of the Government. (3) With respect to achieving the purpose of the loan, obtaining adequatesecurity and being able to service the loan and enforce its rights, theGovernment, as holder of a mortgage upon a lease or leasehold interest,must be in a position substantially as good as if it held a second mortgageon the real estate. Besides the lessor's consent to the SW mortgage onthe leasehold interest, FmHA should consider whether or not: (i) There is reasonable security of tenure. The borrower's interest shouldnot be subject to summary forfeiture or cancellation. (ii) The right to foreclose the SW mortgage and sell without restrictionswould adversely affect the salability or market value of the security.(iii) FmHA has a right to bid at a foreclosure sale or to accept voluntaryconveyance in lieu of foreclosure. (iv) FmHA has the right, after acquiring the leasehold through foreclosureor voluntary conveyance in lieu of foreclosure, or in event of abandonmentby the borrower, to occupy the property or sublet it, and to sell it forcash or credit. In case of a credit sale, the FmHA should take a vendor'smortgage with rights similar to those under the original SW mortgage. (v) The borrower has the right, in the event of default or inability tocontinue with the lease and the SW loan, to transfer the leasehold, subjectto the SW mortgage, to an eligible transferees who will assume the SW debt.(vi) Advance notice will be given to FmHA of the lessor's intention tocancel, terminate or foreclose upon the lease. Such advance notice shouldbe long enough to permit FmHA to ascertain the amount of delinquencies,the total amount of the lessor's and any other prior interest, the marketvalue of the leasehold interest and, if ligation is involved, to referthe case with a report of the facts to the United States Attorney for appropriateaction. (vii) There are express provisions covering the question of FmHA's obligationto pay unpaid rental or other charges accrued at the time it acquires possessionof the property or title to the leasehold, and those which become due duringFmHA's occupancy or ownership, pending further servicing or liquidation.(viii) There are any necessary provisions to assure fair compensation tothe lessee for any part of the premises taken by condemnation. (ix) Any other provisions are necessary to obtain an interest which canbe mortgaged. (4) A State supplement will be issued in any State in which real estateor chattel liens may be taken on leasehold interests in farmland and recordedso as to protect the mortgagee. (5) The following language or similar language which, in the opinion ofOGC or the designated attorney, is legally adequate, will be inserted onthe lien instrument: <ITAG tagnum="21">``All Borrower's right, title, and interest in and to the leaseholdestate for a term of <T2>XX</T2> years beginning on <T2>XX</T2>, 19<T2>X</T2>, created and established by a certain Lease dated <T2>XXXXX</T2>, 19<T2>X</T2>, executed by <T2>XXXXXX</T2> as lessor(s), recorded on <T2>XX</T2>, 19<T2>X</T2>, in Book <T2>XX</T2>, page <T2>XX</T2> of the <T2>XX</T2> Records of said County and State, and any renewals and extensionsthereof, and all Borrower's right, title, and interest in and to said Lease,covering the following real estate:'' (To be inserted just before the legaldescription.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">This additional covenant will be inserted in the mortgage: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Borrower will pay when due all rents and any and all other chargesrequired by said Lease, will comply with all other requirements of saidLease, and will not surrender or relinquish without the Government's writtenconsent, any of the Borrower's right, title or interest in or to said leaseholdestate or under said Lease while this instrument remains in effect. </ITAG>(f) <T3>State supplements. </T3>Each State will supplement this section toprovide instructions on forms to be completed and other requirements tobe met in order to obtain the required security. In each State where loanswill be made to Indians holding title to land in trust or restricted status,FmHA and BIA will decide on a way to exchange necessary information, andthe procedure to be followed will be set out in a State supplement. (g) <T3>Special security requirements. </T3>When SW loans are made to eligibleentities that consist of members, stockholders, partners or joint operatorswho are presently indebted for an SW loan(s) as individual(s) or when SWloans are made to eligible individuals, who are members, stockholders,partners or joint operators of an entity which is presently indebted foran SW loan(s), security must consist of: (1) Chattel and/or real estate security that is separate and identifiablefrom the security pledged to FmHA for any other farmer program insuredor guaranteed loans. (2) Different lien positions on real estate are considered separate andidentifiable collateral. (3) The outstanding amount of loans made may not exceed the value of thecollateral used. (h) <T3>Same security. </T3> Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section,when an SW loan (insured or guaranteed) is made to a borrower who has otherFmHA loans, the same real estate collateral may secure more than one loanso long as the outstanding loan amount does not exceed the total valueof the security. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1943.70_1943.72 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1943.73 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General provisions.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Flood and mudslide hazard areas.</T3> Flood and mudslide hazards willbe evaluated whenever the farm to be financed is located in special floodor mudslide prone areas as designated by the Federal Emergency ManagementAdministration (FEMA).

Any Farmer Programborrower may request Primary or Preservation Loan Service Programs. However,borrowers must be unable to pay their debt as scheduled before FmHA willuse Primary or Preservation Loan Service Programs. The County Supervisorwill use an FmHA computer program (DALR$) to assist in identifying, combining,and documenting the loan service programs that will keep the farmer onthe farm and provide the best net recovery to the Government. Servicingis a continuing process, not a single event. It begins the day a farmercomes into the FmHA supervised credit program. Servicing has two objectives:(1) To help the farmers manage credit so they can return to private sectorcredit sources, and(2) To minimize costs to the Government of providing this opportunity tofarmers in financial difficulty. Borrowers' accounts must be managed withan overall objective of keeping the farmer in business and at the sametime, minimizing loan costs and losses. The tools are rescheduling and/orreamortization, lower interest rates, deferments, and write-down of debt.FmHA can also use Conservation Easement and Softwood Timber Programs whereand when applicable. To establish an effective servicing policy, it isnecessary to include the borrower whose loan payments with FmHA are current.This can be called Phase I. FmHA's servicing objective is to keep the borrowerin business, paying at regular rates and on regular terms with graduationbeing the primary objective. The servicing tools available to keep a borrowerin Phase I are rescheduling and/or reamortization. These tools must beused before an account gets behind schedule and must be considered beforelower interest rates and deferrals. In order for servicing to be effective,all farmer program loans, must be reviewed annually, prior to the datethe annual payments are due. This is necessary in order to determine what,if any, servicing action needs to be taken to keep an account from becomingdelinquent. However, indiscriminate and careless use of the servicing toolsultimately increases borrower failures and program losses. When it becomesevident that FmHA cannot keep a borrower in business, paying regular ratesand after having extended terms to the maximum extent allowable, the borroweris considered to be in Phase II where FmHA has more debt management toolsavailable. These additional tools are lower interest rates and deferrals.The objective is still the same, keep the borrower farming and minimizeloan costs and losses to the Government. Depending upon the reasons theborrower entered Phase II, it is reasonable to expect, with proper servicing,along with normal production and marketing conditions, recovery and returnto Phase I. However, some borrowers may stay in Phase II as long as theyare indebted to FmHA. Here again, servicing should be used to prudentlyavoid delinquency rather than try to remove it. When it becomes impossibleto keep an account from being delinquent and such delinquency exists for180 days, the borrower is considered in Phase III. The borrower receivesthe Notice of Availability of Primary and Preservation Loan Service Programsfor Delinquent Farmer Program borrowers. This phase begins the complicatedprocess of determining if keeping the farmer on the farm will provide thebest net recovery to the Government or whether liquidation offers the bestnet recovery. FmHA also will automatically considered the PreservationLoan Service Programs in this phase when it is determined that the PrimaryLoan Service Programs will not keep the farmer on the farm. FmHA's primaryservicing tools in this phase include consolidation, rescheduling, reamortization,deferral, softwood timber loans, conservation easements, and write-downof a borrower's debt. The procedure, at this point, requires an appraisalof all collateral and a sound and accurate determination as to whetheror not the best net recovery to the Government exists in write-down ofdebt and continuation of the farming operation, or in liquidation of thecollateral securing the FmHA debt. The debt must be written down to a levelat which a feasible plan can be developed. The write-down can go down toan amount that will provide a return to the Government equal to net recoveryfrom an involuntary liquidation. FmHA will continue with the borrower ifnet recovery from loan payments on the debt after debt write-down equalsor exceeds net recovery from liquidation. Once it has been determined thata borrower is not eligible for the Primary Loan Service Programs, everyeffort must be made to keep the farmer in business, using mediation ifnecessary and available, in an attempt to get other creditors to restructuretheir debt if that is what is needed to develop a feasible plan. If itis determined that FmHA cannot restructure the borrower's debt, a Noticeof Intent to Accelerate will be sent to the borrower. This Notice willadvise the borrower of the right to a meeting with FmHA, an appeal, requestan independent appraisal and buy out the FmHA debt at net recovery value.If none of the rights offered in the Notice of Intent to Accelerate providea favorable solution to the determination that the account cannot be restructuredand the borrower does not buy out at net recovery value, FmHA will automaticallyconsider the borrower/owner for the Preservation Loan Service Programs.If the borrower/owner is eligible for the Preservation Loan Service Program,FmHA expects to enter into a contract with the borrower wherein FmHA determinesthe borrower will receive a leaseback/buyback and/or homestead protectionupon conveyance of the real estate and chattels securing the debt. It isexpected that the transaction of conveyance from the borrower(s) and reconveyanceby FmHA to the borrower(s) take place at one sitting, similar to a loanclosing. This means that all documents necessary to complete this transactionmust be prepared in advance and be ready for appropriate signature, etc.(b) When making an adverse decision on the borrower's loan servicing requestor before accelerating the loan account, the borrower must be notifiedof the adverse decision and of the opportunity to appeal. When a borrower'sdebts cannot be restructured or Preservation Loan Service Programs cannotbe used by the borrower/owner, liquidation is required. FmHA will considerthe borrower in Phase IV at this point. Both before and after accelerationthe borrower can sell the property for market value or voluntary convey,to FmHA. If FmHA takes the property into inventory, the farmer is now inPhase V and has the opportunity, along with spouse and children to onceagain be considered for the Preservation Loan Service Programs. The farmeralso may elect to use the Homestead Protection Program rather than leaseback/buybackwhich also can provide a base for farming operations. Leaseback/buybackrights are available in Phase V to spouse and children and family-sizeoperators. Homestead rights are available to only the former owner. Insummary, the loan servicing policy is this:(1) Use rescheduling and/or reamortization at regular interest rates tokeep a borrower in Phase I if at all possible. If that is not possible,go to Phase II.(2) In Phase II, use rescheduling and/or reamortization at limited resourceinterest rates and consider deferral, including softwood timber loans,if necessary, to keep a borrower from becoming delinquent. When a borrower'sloans cannot be restructured using any or all combinations of consolidation,rescheduling, reamortization, deferral, and softwood timber programs whereapplicable, and with limited resource rates, begin Phase III. The borrowercan apply for debt write down and conservation easements before the borroweris 180 days delinquent. Remember that when a loan is 180 days delinquent,FmHA must send Exhibit A with Attachments 1 and 2 of this subpart.(3) In Phase III, FmHA calculates whether or not the best net recoveryto the Government is by keeping the farmer on the farm by using the Primaryand Preservation Loan Service Programs or through liquidation. At thispoint, the borrower is considered for a debt write-down. The value of therestructured debt will be based on the present value of payments the borrowerwould make to the FmHA using any combination of Primary Loan Service Programsthat will provide a feasible plan. Present value is a calculation conceptwhich assigns a lower current value to dollars received in later yearsthan to dollars received at the present time using a specific discountrate. FmHA will use a discount rate based on the 90-day Treasury bill rate.FmHA will analyze the costs of involuntary liquidation to determine thenet recovery value of the collateral securing the debt as if it was involuntarilyacquired and disposed of under the normal FmHA inventory property disposalprocess. The County Supervisor will determine the current market valueof the collateral in accordance with Subpart A of Part 1809 of this chapter(FmHA Instruction 422.1) for real estate property, and on Form FmHA 440-21,``Appraisal of Chattel Property.'' If the calculations show that the valueof the restructured debt is greater than or equal to the net recovery valueof the collateral, FmHA will restructure the debt if the borrower acceptsthe offer within 45 days after written notice. The Phase III process mayinclude mediation if an approved State Mediation Program is available or,when an approved State Mediation Program is not available, an effort mustbe made by FmHA to get under-secured creditors and the borrower togetherwith a mediator where mediators are available, when the other creditor'sdebt is the reason a feasible plan cannot be developed. FmHA State Directorswill develop a State supplement that outlines how the mediation programfor their geographic jurisdiction will be administered. State Directorswill work with the Administrator of the Certified State Agricultural MediationSystem, farm groups, and the Attorney General's office in those statesin which mediation exists in order to develop a reasonable and comprehensivepolicy on how the federal regulations and the State Mediation Programswill coincide. When an approved State mediation program is not available,FmHA will attempt to get undersecured creditors involved in negotiatinga restructuring plan. If trained mediators are available, State Directorsmay contract with them to facilitate the negotiations of debt adjustmentwith undersecured creditors. If undersecured creditors agree to restructuredebts owed to them, so that the borrower can develop a feasible plan ofoperation, FmHA will restructure the borrowers debt to FmHA. If undersecuredcreditors will not participate in negotiations to restructure debts, FmHAwill make the determination that a feasible plan of operation cannot bedeveloped and will proceed with appropriate action to liquidate the borrower'saccounts after the borrower has the opportunity to appeal the FmHA decision.If a feasible plan cannot be developed, the borrower has the opportunityto retain the security property by paying FmHA the net recovery value.Credit will not be provided by FmHA for this transaction. When all or anycombination of these servicing tools show that the best net recovery tothe Government is keeping the farmer on the farm, the debts will be restructured.The borrower cannot pay off FmHA at net recovery value if a feasible plancan be developed with debt restructuring. (4) When all or any combination of Phase III servicing tools have beenfully and carefully considered and it is determined that the best net recoveryto the Government is in liquidation, the borrower will be considered inPhase IV which is the liquidation process. If write down will not work,FmHA automatically considers the Preservation Servicing Program application.Before acceleration, FmHA will offer Preservation Loan Service Programsto borrowers. Both before and after acceleration, the borrower can applyfor debt settlement when conveying the property, either by sale at marketvalue or voluntary conveyance to FmHA. The normal debt settlement procedureswill be followed.(5) After liquidation, the borrower is considered in Phase V. This lastphase is when the property securing the loans passes into FmHA inventory.In this phase, once again, Preservation Loan Service Programs must be offeredto the borrower. The objective is to try to keep the farmer on the farm.The borrower/owner's spouse and/or children are now considered in the priorityfor leaseback/buyback. This will be done with the Leaseback/Buyback Programfor the farm or through the Homestead Protection Program for the home and10 acres. The borrower/owner's spouse and/or children are not eligiblefor homestead protection. The former borrower/owner or immediate familymust meet the eligibility requirements which are set forth in the regulationsfor leaseback/buyback.(6) The borrower will have the opportunity to appeal all FmHA adverse decisions.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1951.903 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Authorities and responsibilities.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Responsibilities</T3>.

The County Supervisormust use the FmHA computer program, Exhibit J, ``Debt and Loan RestructuringSystem (DALR$),'' to attempt to find the combination of loan service programsthat will result in a feasible plan for the borrower. Borrowers requestsfor loan servicing who have disposed of all FmHA security property willbe processed in accordance with Subpart B of Part 1956 of this chapteror Part 1864 of this chapter (FmHA Instruction 456.1), as appropriate.If the borrower's completed application for Primary Loan Servicing includesa request for the Farm Debt Restructure and Conservation Set-Aside EasementProgram, as indicated by the borrowers submission of the information requiredin andSection; 1951.907(h)(1)(xi) of this subpart; the County Supervisorwill determine if the borrower is eligible based on criteria as set forthin Exhibit H of this subpart. If the borrower is eligible, the County Supervisorwill make an estimate of the inputs needed to permit the DALR$ ComputerProgram to make the calculations of feasibility of the Conservation Set-AsideEasement. The assumptions used to establish the estimates will be documentedin the borrower's case file and will be based on the County Supervior'sknowledge of the borrower's farm, land values, the borrower's repaymentability, and the proposed easement acreage. When the DALR$ calculationsfor restructuring are completed, the borrower will be notified as set forthin paragraph (i) of this section.(b) <T3>Adverse determination. </T3>If the County Supervisor or approval officialdetermines that the borrower is not eligible for any of the Primary LoanService Programs or restructuring is not feasible because of debt heldby other lenders, the borrower will be advised of mediation or meetingof creditors as provided in andSection; 1951.912 of this subpart. If mediationor the meeting of creditors does not result in a feasible plan, the borrowerwill be sent the Notice of Intent to Accelerate or to continue accelerationby using Attachments 5 and 6 of Exhibit A of this subpart. This will listand explain the options available to the borrower. The notice advises theborrower of the right to a meeting, right to appeal, right to an independentappraisal, and opportunity to buy the loans at net recovery value. Theappeal, if any, will be completed before FmHA begins any further processingof the borrowers Preservation Loan Service Programs request. Once the appealis concluded and the adverse decision on restructuring is upheld, and ifthe borrower has been determined eligible for the preservation programs,FmHA will complete the processing of the borrower's application for eitherHomestead Protection, Leaseback/Buyback, or both in accordance with andSection;1951.911 of this subpart. No acceleration or foreclosure will occur untilthe appeal process has been completed for both Primary and PreservationLoan Service Programs.(c) <T3>Eligibility. </T3>The County Supervisor or approval official authorizedby andSection; 1951.903(b) of this subpart must find that the borrower whohas applied for Primary Loan Service Programs meets <T3>all </T3>of the following requirements:(1) The delinquency or financial stress does exist and any delinquencyis due to circumstances beyond the control of the borrower due to a reductionin income which reduces the operator's cash flow to a point where outflowsexceed inflows and which causes the need for Primary Loan Service Programs.A reduction of income does not by itself mean that the borrower is eligible.Acceptable reasons for reductions of income which could make a borrowereligible for Primary Loan Service Programs include:(i) The reduction in essential income from a non-farm job due to unemploymentor underemployment of the borrower-operator or spouse caused by circumstancesbeyond the borrower's control; or(ii) Illness, injury, or death of an individual borrower, stockholder,member or partner who operates the farm; or(iii) Natural disasters, an outbreak of uncontrollable disease, and/oruncontrollable insect damage which caused severe loss of agricultural productionthat reduced the repayment ability of the borrower so that scheduled paymentcannot be made; or(iv) Economic factors that are widespread and not limited to an individualcase, such as high interest rates or loan market prices for agriculturalcommodities as compared to production costs, that reduce the repaymentability of the borrower so that the scheduled payments cannot be made.(2) The borrower has acted in good faith by demonstrating sincerity andhonesty in meeting agreements set forth on Form FmHA 1962-1, ``Agreementfor the Use of Proceeds/Release of Chattel Security,'' and agreements madewith FmHA. Any allegations of fraud, waste, and conversion used in orderto deny borrowers' requests for Primary Loan Service Programs will be substantiatedby FmHA, with a written legal opinion from the Office of General Counsel,before denying the borrower's requests for such programs.(3) All applications received from borrowers who apply for Primary LoanServicing, even though they are not eligible, must be processed to determinewhether or not a feasible plan of operation can be developed. <T3>Borrowers who do not meet </T3>the eligibility criteria as set forthin paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section, must be processed in thesame manner as a <T3>borrower who does not meet </T3>the feasibility requirements. See andSection;1951.909(h)(3)(ii) of this subpart.(d) <T3>FmHA's feasibility determinations. </T3>The County Supervisor mustdetermine that the borrower will be able to:(1) Meet the necessary family living and farm operating expense; and(2) Service all debts, including those of the loans restructured; and(3) Except for the establishment of a conservation easement under ExhibitH of this subpart, the loan, if restructured, must result in a net recoveryto the Government, during the term of the loan as restructured, that wouldbe more than or equal to the net recovery to the Government from an involuntaryliquidation or foreclosure on the property securing the loan(s). A comparisonto net recovery to the Government will not be made when using conservationeasements.(e) <T3>Primary Loan Service Programs. </T3>Any Farmer Program borrower mayrequest Primary Loan Service Programs described in this subpart at anytime. However, borrowers must show that they are not able to pay theirdebt as scheduled before FmHA will approve Primary Loan Service Programs.Rescheduling, reamortization, consolidation, or deferral may be utilizedfor any eligible borrower. Debt write-down will <T3>only be </T3>used for delinquent borrowers who cannot develop feasibleplans of operations without debt write-down.(1) <T3>Consolidation and rescheduling of OL, SL, and EO loans, EE operating-typeloans and EM loans made for Subtitle B purposes including EM loss loans.</T3>This subsection explains how to consolidate and/or reschedule <T3>existing </T3>loans, providing the borrower agrees to such actions.When the County Supervisor determines that consolidation and/or reschedulingwill assist in the orderly collection of the loan, the County Supervisorshould take such action provided all of the following conditions exist:(i) The borrower meets the eligibility requirements in andSection; 1951.909(c)of this subpart;(ii) Such action is not taken to circumvent FmHA's graduation requirements;(iii) The borrower's account is not being serviced by the Office of theGeneral Counsel (OGC) or the U.S. Attorney and there are no FmHA plansto have the account serviced by either of these offices in the near future;(iv) Loans may be rescheduled or reamortized, as appropriate, to bringthe account current or to keep the account from becoming delinquent. Asufficient number of notes including all delinquent notes will be rescheduledto permit the development of a feasible plan of operation.(v) The borrower will comply with the highly Erodible Land and WetlandConservation provisions of Exhibit M of Subpart G of Part 1940 of thischapter.(vi) Loans secured by real estate will not be consolidated and/or rescheduled,until the County Supervisor reviews the Government's real estate lien priorityand value of security and decides that such an action will be in the bestinterest of the Government and the borrower. If there are any liens whichwere not in existence at the time the note was signed, the County Supervisorwill ask the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) for an opinion as to whatlien position the Government will have if a new note is taken.(vii) Only loans of the same type and interest rate will be consolidated.(viii) EM actual loss and SL loans will <T3>not </T3>be consolidated.(ix) The County Supervisor will not consolidate a loan serviced under SubpartL of this part with another loan.(x) Loans that have been deferred under this section will not be consolidatedand/or rescheduled during the deferral period.(xi) If loans with a debt set-aside are to be rescheduled, the debt set-asidemust be cancelled at the time the consolidation and/or rescheduling isgranted. The borrower must agree in writing to cancellation of the debtset-aside if the consolidation and/rescheduling is to be approved. If theset-aside portion is not cancelled, then only the non set-aside portionwill be rescheduled.(xii) Terms of consolidated and/or rescheduled loans are as follows:(A) Consolidated and/or rescheduled loans will be repaid according to theborrower's repayment ability, but will not exceed 15 years from the dateof the consolidation and/or rescheduling action, except:(B) Repayment of loans solely for recreation and/or nonfarm enterprisepurposes may not exceed seven years from the date of the consolidationand/or rescheduling action (the date of the new note is signed).(C) Repayment of EE loans may not exceed 20 years from the date of theoriginal note.(xiii) Interest rates of consolidated and/or rescheduled loans will beas follows:(A) The interest rate for consoldiated and/or rescheduled loans will bethe lesser of the current interest rate for that type of loan or the lowest<T3>original </T3>loan note rate on any of the original notes being consolidatedand/or rescheduled. In the case of an OL-limited resource loan, it willbe the lesser of the current limited resource OL loan rate or the originalnote rate. The interest rate for loans rescheduled but not consolidatedwill be the lesser of the current interest rate for that type of loan orthe <T3>original </T3>loan note rate.(B) Limited Resource Rate. At the time of the consolidation and/or reschedulingaction, OL loans may be assigned a limited resource rate if: (<T3>1</T3>) The borrower meets the requirements for the limited resourceinterest rate, and (<T3>2</T3>) a feasible plan cannot be developed at regular interest ratesand maximum terms permitted in this section.(xiv) The original (old) note(s) will be marked ``Rescheduled'' and stapledto the new rescheduled promissory note and will be filed in the operationfile.

RHF loans may not exceed33 years from the date of the original note or assumption agreement.(B) The FmHA's lien priority may be affected if the final due date of theoriginal loan is extended. A State supplement will be issued to provideinstructions on the effect that a change in the final due date has on securityinstruments and the actions necessary to retain the Government's lien priority.The State supplement will also include instructions for releasing the originalsecurity instrument when a new one is obtained.(C) The amount of accured interest more than 90 days overdue and any advancescharged to the borrower's account will be added to the principal at thetime of the reamortization action (the date the new note is signed by theborrower). If there are not deferred installments, the first installmentpayment under the reamortization will be at least equal to the interestamount which will accrue on the new principle between the date the FormFmHA 1940-17 is processed and the next installment due date. See SectionII E of Exhibit J of this subpart for an explanation of how to schedulepayments of interest not more than 90 days overdue.(ix) <T3>Interest.</T3>(A) The interest rate will be the current interest rate in effect on thedate of reamortization (the date the new note is signed by the borrower),or the interest rate on the <T3>original </T3>Promissory Note to be reamortized, whichever is less.In the case of a limited resource loan, it will be limited resource FOloan rate or the original loan note rate; whichever is less.(B) At the time of the reamortization, an FO loan may be changed to a limitedresource interest rate if: (<T3>1</T3>) The borrower meets the requirements for a limited resourceinterest rate, and (<T3>2</T3>) a feasible plan cannot be developed at regular interest ratesand at the maximum terms permitted in this section.(x) The amount of outstanding accrued interest more than 90 days overdueand any outstanding credit advances made on the loan will be added to theprincipal at the time of reamortization (the date the new note is signedby the borrower). See Section II E of Exhibit J of this subpart for anexplanation of how to schedule payment of interest not over 90 days overdue.(xi) The original (old) note(s) will be marked ``Reamortized'' and willbe stapled to the new promissory note and filed in the operational file.Copies for the borrower(s) case file should be marked and stapled the sameand filed in position 2 of the case file. If a transfer is involved, assumptionagreement(s) will be marked and stapled with the note(s) and copies filedas indicated above. If a part of a note is written down, the written downnote will be marked ``Reamortized with Debt write Down'' and will be filedas indicated above in this paragraph.(3) <T3>Deferral of existing OL, FO, SW, RL, EM, EO, SL, RHF, and EE loans.</T3>(i) <T3>Loan deferrals. </T3>Deferrals will be considered by FmHA only afterit has been determined that consolidation, rescheduling, and reamortization,in accordance with this subpart, will not provide a feasible plan.(ii) <T3>Conditions. </T3>In order to be considered for a deferral, the borrowermust meet all of the following conditions:(A) The need for the deferral must be temporary. To be ``temporary'' meansthat the borrower will be able to show to the satisfaction of FmHA thatthey will be able to resume payment on the debt by the end of the deferralperiod, or the new payments, as established by using consolidation, rescheduling,or reamortization can be resumed at the end of the deferral period.(B) Continuation of loan payments as presently scheduled without change,will unduly impair the borrower's standard of living. An unduly impairedstandard of living is a condition whereby the borrower, due to circumstancesbeyond the borrower's control, is unable to pay essential family livingexpenses (partnerships, joint operators, corporations, and cooperativesdo not have family living expenses), pay normal farm operating expenses,including reasonable and customary hired labor and/or salary paid to theoperator(s) of a partnership, a joint operation, a corporation, or a cooperative,maintain essential chattels and real estate, and meet the schedule paymentsof all debts.(iii) <T3>FmHA's determinations. </T3>The FmHA approval official must:(A) Determine that the borrower meets the eligible requirements of andSection;1951.909(c) of the subpart;(B) Determine that a deferral of payments is necessary and appropriatelydocument the conditions causing the need for deferral;(C) If a feasible plan cannot be developed after consideration of a deferral,the County Supervisior will inform the borrower about the Softwood Timber(ST) loan program authorized by Exhibit G of this subpart by sending Attachment1 of Exhibit G of this subpart by certified mail, return receipt requested,within 5 days after the adverse deferral determination. If the borrowerrequests the County Supervison to determine that an ST loan may allow theborrower to continue to farm, within 15 days of the borrower's receiptof Attachment 1, the County, Supervisor will determine if the borroweris eligible, based on criteria as set forth in Exhibit G of this subpart.If the borrower is eligible the County Supervisor will help the borrowerto develop a plan to determine if a feasible operation can be developedutilizing this program. The discussion will be documented in the borrower'scase file.(iv) <T3>FmHA loan deferral considerations.</T3>(A) A sufficient number of loans must be considered for deferral to permitthe borrower to have a feasible plan.(B) A deferral plan may include a reorganization of the farming operation,including the use of new enterprises, to overcome existing financial, economicor other limitations of the operation. If the proposed restructuring requirescapital expenditures, a subordination or additional loan will be considered.Deferral of additional loan installments beyond those needed to allow theborrower to develop a feasible plan will not be used to create additionalcash reserve for capital purchases. Such purchases are not considered operatingexpenses.(C) A typical year during the deferral period is a year which most closelyrepresented the borrower's operation for the entire deferral period. Theremay be no typical year for farming or ranching operations undergoing amajor reorganization. If there is no typical year, then it will be necessaryto develop a plan of operation for each year of the deferral.(D) The deferral of loan installments is not intended to create a highnet cash reserve where revenue substantially exceeds expenses. If the deferralof a complete note would cause a high net cash reserve during the entiredeferral period, a full deferral should not be granted. In such a case,a partial, deferral should be considered to obtain a feasible plan of operation.The same approach should be used for situations in which there is no typicalyear and debt payments must vary throughout the deferral period.(E) The borrower must submit feasible plans of operation to support anydeferral request. Plans of operation in conjunction with loan deferralsmust be realistic and supported by the borrower's actual records.(v) <T3>Additional and subsequent deferrals. </T3>If, during the period ofthe initial deferral, the borrower is unable to make the scheduled payments,the borrower may again request Primary Loan Service actions. It may benecessary to cancel existing deferrals or to defer additional loans todevelop a feasible plan in such cases. If it is necessary to defer additionalloans, such action will be taken if the deferral will result in a greaternet recovery to the Government than debt write-down. Borrowers may obtainsubsequent deferrals after the deferral period provided the conditionsof this subsection are met.(vi) <T3>Special debt set-aside loans. </T3>If a borrower desires a deferralfor a loan that has a portion of the debt set-aside, the set-aside portionwill be cancelled at the time the deferral is granted. The borrower mayretain the set-aside loan and request a deferral on other loans. A borrowerwho desires a deferral of a set-aside loan must first agree in writingto the cancellation of the set-aside if the deferral is approved.(vii) <T3>Term and interest rate. </T3>A deferral period will not exceed five(5) annual installments. Deferral interest rates will be determined asspecified in andSection;andSection; 1951.909(e)(1)(xiii) and 1951.909(e)(2)(ix)of this subpart.(A) All loans being deferred will be consolidated, rescheduled or reamortized,as applicable. The promissory note rescheduled, reamortized or consolidatedfor the deferral will show ``zero'' as the installments due during theperiod of the deferral if the whole note is deferred and will not be changedduring the deferral period unless the conditions of of andSection; 1951.909(e)(3)(v)of this subpart are met. The County Supervisor will determine the amountof interest that will accrue, if any, during the deferred period. Thisinterest will be repaid in equal amortized installment during the termof the loan remaining after the deferral period. The calculated installmentswill be added to the remaining installments for the remaining principalbalance and inserted on the promissory note as a scheduled installmentfor the remaining period of the loan. The Finance Office will apply thepayments made on the note in accordance with this subpart. The amount ofoutstanding accrued interest more than 90 days overdue and any outstandingcredit advances made on the loan will be added to the principal at thetime of the deferral (the date the new note is signed by the borrower).See Section II E of Exhibit J of this subpart for an explanation of howto schedule payment of interest not over 90 days overdue.(B) The Finance Office will be notified of the deferral by the County Officecompleting Form FmHA 1965-22 and 1965-23. The FmHA Finance Office willremove the borrower's name from the delinquency report.(C) If a deferral is approved, the borrower's name and the date of approvalwill be recorded and maintained in accordance with Subpart A of Part 1905of this chapter (available in any FmHA office). The Finance Office willprovide the County Office with a quarterly status report for each borrowerwho has received a deferral.(D) Six months prior to the end of the deferral period the County Supervisorwill notify the borrower in writing of the expiration of the deferral andthe amount and date of the borrower's first upcoming installment of theFmHA debt.(E) The County Supervisor must notify the Finance Office of any cancellationof a deferral by letter.(viii) <T3>Increase in repayment ability. </T3>At the time the County Supervisormakes the analysis required by andSection; 1924.60 of Subpart B of Part 1924of this chapter, the County Supervisor will determine whether the borrowerhas had an increase in income and repayment ability. If an income increaseis substantial enough to enable the borrower to graduate, the case willbe handled in accordance with Subpart F of Part 1951 of this chapter. Ifan increase would enable the borrower to make some payments during thedeferral period, the County Supervisor will, in writing, ask the borrowerto sign a Form FmHA 440-9, ``Supplementary Payment Agreement,'' within30 days of the date of the written request. The letter will provide theborrower with the right to appeal as set forth in subpart B of Part 1900of this chapter. When doing the analysis to determine whether there isa substantial increase in income and repayment ability, the County Supervisorwill determine whether this increase exists by comparing it to the originalplan developed in the deferral application and also to plans developedfor the current operating year to determine that the excess income is notneeded for essential living and operating expenses or scheduled debt payment.If the borrower does not sign a Form FmHA 440-9 or appeal the request fora supplement payment within the required time, and/or does not honor theterms and conditions of the repayment agreement, such actions will be consideredabuse of the program. The borrower's account will be handled as set forthin andSection; 1951.907(g) of this subpart.(4) <T3>Special debt set-aside provision for a portion of the insured loanindebtedness of farmer program borrowers (NOT AVAILABLE AFTER SEPTEMBER30, 1985).</T3>(i) <T3>Period of time available. </T3>The authorities contained in this sectionwere available to financially stressed FmHA farmer program borrowers (OL,FO, EO, SW, EE, EM, RL but not association recreation loans and/or <T3>only </T3>those Rural Housing (RH) loans which were made for farm servicebuildings) until September 30, 1985. The County Supervisor will maintaina record of approval special set-aside amounts, in accordance with FmHAInstruction 1905-A (available in any FmHA office).(ii) <T3>Agency Finance Office Actions are as follows:</T3>(A) The FmHA Finance Office has established the set-aside portion of thedebt as a separate account, in accordance with Form FmHA 1951-6.(B) The Finance Office will provide each county office with a quarterlystatus report for each borrower receiving a set-aside.(C) Six months prior to the end of the set-aside period, the Finance Officewill notify the County Supervisor of the amount of the borrower's upcominginstallment(s) due date.(D) The interest rate on the set-aside portion of the note, after the set-asideperiod has passed, will be the same rate as on the non-set-aside portionof the note.(iii) <T3>Cancellation of special set-aside agreements may take place under thefollowing circumstances:</T3>(A) Borrowers who incur debt or purchase items not planned for in the Farmand Home Plan without the County Supervisor's approval, violate any ofthe covenants contained in any security instruments, loan agreements, orcease farming will have their set-aside cancelled by the County Supervisor.(B) The County Supervisor will send written notice by certified mail, returnreceipt requested, to the borrower of FmHA's intention to cancel the set-aside.This notification will set forth the specific facts requiring cancellationand inform the borrower of appeal rights in accordance with Subpart B ofPart 1900 of this chapter. If the borrower does not appeal or if the FmHAdecision to cancel is upheld in an appeal, the borrower will be notifiedin writing of cancellation date of the set-aside. The actual cancellationaction is not appealable.(C) The County Office will be responsible for notifying the Finance Officeof the cancellation action using a properly executed Form FmHA 1951-6 preparedaccording to the FMI.(iv) <T3>Requirements for servicing set-aside loans are as follows:</T3>(A) Loan notes which are rescheduled and contain set-aside provisions inaccordance with this section will not be consolidated during the set-asideperiod unless the borrower agrees in writing to the cancellation of theset-aside if consolidation is approved.(B) Loan notes which are rescheduled and do not contain set-aside provisionsin accordance with this section may be rescheduled or reamortized in accordancewith this subpart during the set-aside period. The rescheduling or reamortizationaction may be the limited resource rate, if applicable. The set-aside amountwill stay in effect, but will not be increased or intensified beyond theoriginal five-year term. The County Office will forward to the FinanceOffice Form FmHA 1965-22 and Form FmHA 1965-23 any time the interest rateis changed on a note during the set-aside period. The top of the form willbe marked in red ``Interest Change in Set-Aside.''(v) <T3>Deficiency judgements. </T3>Interest will begin to accrue (at the higherof the current interest rate or the judgement interest rate) on the set-asideportion if FmHA receives a deficiency judgement.(5) <T3>Write-down of FmHA loans. </T3>Priority consideration will be givento writing down farmer program loans whenever such write-down will facilitatekeeping the farmer on the farm or ranching operation. The following conditionsshall be met for write-down of FmHA loans:(i) No other Primary Loan Service Program nor any combination thereof willproduce a feasible plan that will allow the borrower to continue the operation;(ii) A feasible plan must be developed that will result in a net recoveryto the Government which is equal to or more than a net recovery from aninvoluntary liquidation or foreclosure; (iii) The borrower must present a preliminary plan that demonstrates thatthe borrower will be able to: (A) Meet the necessary family living and farm operating expenses, and (B) Service all existing and planned debts, and (C) Comply with the Highly Erodible Land and Wetland Conservation requirementsof Exhibit M of Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter, if applicable,and (D) Borrower must agree to a Shared Appreciation Agreement if the loan(s)is secured by real estate. (iv) The borrower should participate in a meeting with creditors if itis necessary that the borrower's creditors make some debt adjustments thatwill permit the development of a feasible plan. This meeting may be ina Certified State Agricultural Mediation Program or a meeting of creditorsarranged by FmHA, the borrower, or other creditor. Failure by the borrowerto participate in meetings with FmHA and other creditors will be notedin the case file. Failure to participate will be listed as a reason forthe intended adverse action on Attachment 5 Exhibit A of this subpart.(v) <T3>Rates and Terms. </T3>Remaining debt after restructuring with the PrimaryLoan Servicing Programs will be rescheduled, reamortized, or deferred inaccordance with paragraph (e) of this section. The borrower must agreein writing to the cancellation of a fully or partially set-aside portionof the loan(s) if a write-down is approved. (f) <T3>Determining value of net recovery from involuntary liquidation. </T3>Within60 days of the County Supervisor's receipt of a complete application whichrequests Primary and Preservation Loan Service Programs, the County Supervisormust make the calculations required in this section. (1) The County Supervisor will determine the net recovery to the FederalGovernment equivalent to involuntary liquidation of the collateral securingthe FmHA debt in accordance with Exhibit J, ``Debt and Loan RestructuringSystem,'' and will follow the guidance provided by State supplements andExhibit I, ``Guidance for Determining Adjustments for Net Recovery Valueof Collateral.'' The County Supervisor will determine the current marketvalue of the collateral including tangible and intangible property in existenceand of record in accordance with Subpart A of Part 1809 of this chapter(FmHA Instruction 422.1) for real estate property, and on Form FmHA 440-21,``Appraisal of Chattel Property (available in any FmHA office).'' Collateralmay include real estate, chattels, and tangible or intangible property.Chattels include machinery, equipment, livestock, growing crops, and cropsin storage. Tangible or intangible property may include accounts receivable,Government Payments. From the current market value of the collateral, thefollowing adjustments will be made: (i) Subtract the amount which would be required to pay prior liens on thecollateral property; (ii) Subtract taxes and assessments, depreciation, management costs, andinterest cost to the Government based on the 90-day Treasury Bills (publishedin Exhibit B of FmHA Instruction 440.1, available in any FmHA office).Taxes and assessments, depreciation, management costs, as well as interestcosts will be calculated on the current market value of the property forthe average inventory holding period. The holding period for suitable inventoryfarm property, will be established by each State as of July 1 each year.(iii) Adjust the current market value for estimated increases or decreasesin value of the property for the holding period specified in paragraph(f)(2) of this section. (iv) Subtract resale expenses, such as repairs, commissions, and advertising;(v) Other administrative and attorney's expenses; and (vi) Add income which will be received after acquisition. (2) <T3>Determining costs of involuntary liquidation of collateral for farmloans. </T3>The State Directors will analyze the costs of involuntary liquidationwithin the geographic areas of their jurisdiction and issue a State supplementof estimated costs and average holding time to be used as guidelines byCounty Supervisors in making calculations of net recovery value under thissubsection. Exhibit I, ``Net Recovery Value Determination,'' will be usedin establishing the guidelines contained in the State supplement. Suchcosts analyses will be carried out in July of each year. State Directorswill consult with State Directors of adjoining States, other lenders, realestate agents, auctioneers, and others in the community to gather and analyzethe information specified in this subpart. (g) <T3>Determining net recovery value resulting from primary servicing. </T3>Thevalue of the restructured debt will be based on the present value of paymentsthe borrower would make to the FmHA using any combination of primary loanservice programs that will provide a feasible plan. Present value is acalculation concept which assigns a lower current value to dollars receivedin later years than to dollars received at the present time. County Supervisorswill use a discount rate based on 90-day Treasury Bills as of the datethe borrower files the application for restructuring. The National Officewill publish the 90-day Treasury Bill rate in Exhibit B of FmHA Instruction440.1 (available in any FmHA office). (h) <T3>Notification requirements. </T3>(1) If the calculations show that thevalue of the restructured debt is greater than or equal to the net recoveryvalue of the collateral securing the debt, the County Supervisor will forwardto the State Director the borrower's Farm and Home Plan and the originalprintout of the DALR$ calculations. The County Supervisor will certifythat the borrower meets all requirements for debt restructuring with thewrite-down amount specified on the printout. The State Director's authorizationto the County Supervisor to proceed with the write-down will be evidencedby the State Director's signature affixed to the original copy of the DALR$printout returned to the County Supervisor. Within 60 days after receivinga complete application the County Supervisor will notify the borrower ofthe results of the calculations by sending Exhibit F of this subpart, certifiedmail, return receipt requested and offer to restructure the debt. A printoutof the DALR$ calculations will be attached to Exhibit F, ``Notificationsof Approval Offer to Debt Restructure.'' Exhibit F will inform the borrower(s)of FmHA's offer to restructure the debt. If the borrower accepts the offer,within 45 days of the borrowers receipt of Exhibit F, the County Supervisorwill restructure the debt within 45 days after receipt of the written noticeof the borrower's acceptance of FmHA's offer to restructure the debt. Ifthe borrower, both accelerated and nonaccelerated, do not respond to ExhibitF within 45 days, or declines FmHA's offer to restructure the debt, theCounty Supervisor will send Attachments 9 and 10 of Exhibit A of this subpart.If Attachment 10 is not returned within 30 days of the borrower's receiptof the attachments, the account will be accelerated or foreclosed in accordancewith andSection; 1955.15 of subpart A of Part 1955 of this chapter. (2) If the borrower previously returned Attachment 2 or 4 to Exhibit Aof this subpart within 45 days, requesting a Farm Debt Restructure andConservation Set-Aside Easement Program, by submitting an ASCS photo ofthe farm showing the portion of the farm and approximate acres to be consideredin their request, the County Supervisor will proceed with processing therequest for debt relief. The request will be processed as set forth inExhibit H of this subpart. (3) If the DALR$ calculations indicate a feasible plan of operation <T3>cannot </T3>be developed considering all Primary Loan Service Programs,Softwood Timber, or Conservation Set-Aside Easement Programs, the CountySupervisor will take the following actions within 15 days from the dateof the determination that the borrower's debt cannot be restructured asrequested. (i) When the borrower has creditors other than FmHA, and a feasible planof operation cannot be developed after consideration of Primary Loan Service,Softwood Timber and Farm Debt Restructure and Conservation Set-Aside EasementPrograms, the borrower will be sent Exhibit E, ``Notification of Requestfor Mediation or Meetings of Creditors,'' of this subpart, certified mail,return receipt requested. A printout of the DALR$ calculations will beattached to Exhibit E. Exhibit E will inform the borrower that FmHA isrequesting mediation or a meeting with the borrower's undersecured creditorsholding a substantial portion of the borrowers debt, in an effort to obtaina debt adjustment agreement with such creditors which may permit the developmentof a feasible plan of operation. If the borrower does not respond to ExhibitE within 30 days (a response is <T3>only</T3> required in States without a certified mediation program),the County Supervisor will send Attachments 5 and 6 of Exhibit A of thissubpart, certified mail, return receipt requested. (ii) If mediation or the voluntary meeting of creditors is not successful,the borrower will be sent Attachments 5 and 6 of Exhibit A of this subpart,certified mail, return receipt requested, within 15 days of the unsuccessfulmediation or meeting. The DALR$ computer printout will be attached to Attachment5 of Exhibit A. Attachment 5 of Exhibit A will inform the borrower of furtherrights. This section also applies to borrowers whose accounts were acceleratedbetween November 1, 1985, and May 7, 1987, and other accelerated borrowerswhose accounts have not been foreclosed or liquidated. (iii) As stated in Attachment 5, the borrower will have 45 days after thereceipt of the notification of ineligibility to purchase the security propertyat net recovery value, provided the value of the restructured loan is lessthan the recovery value. FmHA will not provide credit for this transaction.(iv) Prior to the buy out at net recovery value, the borrower must, asa condition of the sale, enter into written agreement by executing ExhibitC, ``Net Recovery Buyout Recapture Agreement,'' of this subpart. The CountySupervisor will process the net recovery buyout payment and will inputthe information to establish the recapture receivable account via the multi-functionworkstation. A new mortgage or deed of trust will be taken for the bestlien obtainable. The new mortgage or deed of trust will describe ExhibitC and enter the amount due under the net recovery buyout recapture agreement.The new mortgage or deed of trust will secure repayment of the net recoverybuyout recapture agreement. The old mortgage or deed of trust will be releasedin accordance with andSection; 1951.909(k) of this subpart. (i) <T3>Administrative appeals.</T3> (1) If the borrower appeals the decisionto deny Primary Loan Service Programs, the 45 day period for the borrowerto pay FmHA net recovery value of the collateral will start on the daythe borrower receives the final appeal or review upholding the initialdecision. Such decision letter will be sent to the borrower by the HearingOfficer or Review Officer certified mail, return receipt requested. Thereturn receipt is to be sent to the address of the County Office by theHearing and/or Review officers.(2) If the administrative appeal process results in a determination thatthe borrower is eligible for debt write-down, the County Supervisor willwrite-down the loan in accordance with this subpart, taking into considerationthe write-down recommendations, if any, of the Appeal Officer. If the administrativeappeal process results in a determination that the borrower is ineligiblefor debt write-down, the borrower will be sent Exhibit K and Attachment1 of Exhibit K, advising the borrower of FmHA's intent to continue processingthe application for Preservation Loan Service Programs as set forth inandSection;1951.911 of this subpart. If the borrower does not return Attachment1 of Exhibit K within 15 days of the date that Exhibit K is sent, the CountySupervisor will continue to process the borrower preservation loan servicerequest in accordance with andSection;1951.911(a)(5) of this subpart. Theaccount will not be accelerated or forclosure will not continue, untilthe borrower has the opportunity to appeal any denial of the PreservationLoan Service request. If the borrower returns Attachment 1 of Exhibit Kwithin 15 days of the date Exhibit K is sent, the account will be acceleratedor foreclosure will proceed in accordance with andSection;1955.15 of SubpartA of Part 1955 of this chapter. When the account is accelerated the borrowerwill not be considered for further loan assistance under andSection;1941.14of Subpart A of Part 1941 of this chapter.(3) If the borrower appeals the current market appraisal completed by FmHA,the borrower may obtain an appraisal by an independent appraiser selectedfrom a list provided by FmHA in accordance with andSection;1900.57 (1) ofSubpart B of Part 1900 of this chapter. The borrower does not have to exclusivelyappeal the current market appraisal in order to be entitled to the independentappraisal, but simply must appeal the denial of Primary Loan Service Programsin which the appraisal, as part of the net recovery value calculation,is relevant. The cost of the appraisal must be paid by the borrower. Theindependent appraisal will be considered by the appeal officer. The independentappraiser must meet at least one of the following qualifications as determinedby the FmHA County Supervisor:(i) Certification by a National or State Appraisal Society.(ii) If a certified appraiser is not available the appraiser may be onewho meets the criteria for certification in a National or State appraisalsociety.(iii) The appraiser has recent, relevant documented appraisal experienceor training, or other factors clearly establishing the appraisers qualifications.(j) <T3>Processing of write-down.</T3> Borrowers <T3>who are eligible</T3> for Primary Loan Service Programs with write-downwill have their loans rescheduled or reamortized in accordance with thissubpart. All loan servicing actions approved in connection with the write-downmust take place simultaneously. The borrower and County Supervisor willcomplete Exhibit D to this subpart, ``Shared Appreciation Agreement.''Exhibit D provides for recapture as specified in andSection;1951.914 of thissubpart of a portion of any appreciation in the value of the real propertysecuring the debt remaining after the write-down. The FmHA DALR$ computerprogram will be used to determine the notes to be written down.(1) A separate Form FmHA 1940-17, ``Promissory Note,'' will be used foreach note or assumption agreement being reamortized.(2) A Form FmHA 1940-17 will be completed, signed, and distributed as providedin the FMI.(3) The loan servicing action date of approval is also the date that willbe inserted on the rescheduled or reamortized Form FmHA 1940-17 and onExhibit B of this subpart, ``Noncash Credit for Farmer Program Loans WhenEstablishing Recapture Receivable.''(4) A Form FmHA 1940-17 may be processed provided the County Office haspossession of the original note being reamortized. If the County Officedoes not have possession of the original note, the County Supervisor willask the FmHA Finance Office to return the original note so it is in theCounty Office <T3>before</T3> Form FmHA 1040-17 is processed.(5) The County Supervisor will complete Form FmHA 1965-22, ``Informationon Assumption on New Terms or Other Change in Terms,'' Form FmHA 1965-23,``Supplemental Information on Assumption and/or Change of Terms,'' andExhibit D of this subpart in accordance with the provisions of the formsmanual insert.(6) The original (old) note(s) will be marked ``Rescheduled or Reamortizedwith Writedown Debt'' and stapled to the new rescheduled or reamortizedpromissory note(s) and will be filed in the promissory note file in theoperation file. Copies for the borrower(s) case file should be marked andstapled the same and filed in position 2 of the case file. If a transferis involved, assumption agreement(s) will be marked and stapled with thenote(s) and copies will be filed as indicated above.(k) <T3>Real estate liens.</T3> If the write-down of the borrower's real estatedebt results in all debts to FmHA being written down, FmHA real estateliens will be maintained and will not be subordinated to increase the amountof the prior liens during the shared appreciation period. Shared appreciationagreements will be serviced in accordance with andSection;1951.914 of thissubpart. Upon payment by the borrower of net recovery in a buy out, theoriginal mortgage or deed of trust will be released on real estate forthe FmHA loans bought out. The notes will be marked ``satisfied at netrecovery value'' and returned to the debtor or the debtor's legal representative.Net recovery buyout recapture agreements will be serviced in accordancewith andSection;1951.913 of this subpart.(l) <T3>Non real estate liens.</T3> If a borrower <T3>does not own</T3> any real estate there will be no recapture and theborrower will not be required to enter into a recapture agreement. Uponpayment by the borrower of Net Recovery Value in a buy out, the originalsecurity instruments will be released on chattel security for the FmHAloans bought out. The notes will be marked ``satisfied at net recoveryvalue'' and returned to the debtor or the debtor's legal representative.(m) <T3>Notes.</T3> Notes evidencing debts written off as a result of PrimaryServicing debt write-down or buy-out at net recovery value will be returnedto the debtor or to the debtor's legal representative. The notes will bereturned at the end of any recapture period. If there is no recapture period,the notes will be returned when the County Office verifies that the transactionhas been recorded in the Finance Office. For a buyout, the original andcopies of the notes will be marked ``satisfied by approved net recoverybuyout.'' For write-down, the original and copies of the notes will bemarked ``satisfied by approved debt write-down.'' If a note is only partiallywritten-down, the note will be returned to the debtor or debtor's legalrepresentative when the note is paid in full.

If the previousowner is not interested in leasing or purchasing the property, perferencefor leaseback/buyback will be given to the spouse and/or child(ren) ofthe previous owner who are actively engaged in farming (if the previousowner was an individual); entity members (if the previous owner is an entitythat is composed exclusively of members of the same family) who are activelyengaged in farming; and the immediate previous family-size operator (lessee).CONACT property that is acquired on or after January 6, 1988, that securedan FmHA loan will be considered for leaseback/buyback under this Section.CONACT property acquired prior to January 6, 1988, will also be consideredunder this section, but only if the former owner/previous operator wasnot advised of his or her leaseback/buyback rights under FmHA's previousleaseback/buyback regulation. If there is a conflict between leaseback/buybackand FmHA's Homestead program, priority will be given to the applicationfor homestead protection with respect to the lease of the borrower's principaldwelling. The same applicant may be considered for both leaseback/buybackand homestead protection if requested.

This notice tells you: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) How to get more information </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) How to apply </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Your appeal rights if you apply and are turned down </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">How to Get More Information</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Ask at any county FmHA office for copies of the FmHA rules describingthese programs. These rules must be given to you within 10 days. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Who Can Apply? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">All ``farmer program borrowers'' who have one of the following loans:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Operating (OL) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Farm Ownership (FO) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Emergency (EM) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Economic Emergency (EE) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Soil and Water (SW) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Recreation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Special Livestock </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Rural Housing Loans made for farm service buildings </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Economic Opportunity </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">You May Need Help in Applying. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The legal requirements for these programs are very complicated. Youmay need help to understand them. You may want to ask an attorney to helpyou. If you cannot get an attorney, there are organizations that give freeor low-cost advice to farmers. Ask your State Department of Agricultureor the USDA Extension what services are available in your state. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note.</T4>_FmHA County Supervisors cannot recommend a particular attorneyor organization. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">I. Primary Loan Service Programs </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(1) Loan Consolidation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Two or more of the same type of loans can be combined into one largerloan. For example, operating loans can only be joined with operating loansand farm ownership loans with farm ownership loans. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(2) Loan Rescheduling </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The payment schedule can be altered to give you longer to repay loanssecured by equipment, livestock, or crops. For example, the time for repaymentof an operating-type loan can be extended up to 15 years. When a loan isrescheduled, the interest rate may be reduced. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(3) Loan Reamortization </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The payment schedule can be changed to give you longer to repay loanssecured by real estate. For example, a Farm Ownership loan payback periodmay be extended to 40 years from the date the original loan was signed.When a loan is reamortized, the interest rate may be reduced. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(4) Interest Rate Reduction </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Regular Interest Rate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">FmHA has specific interest rates for each type of loan. These interestrates change quite often. They depend on what it costs the government toborrow money. Each type of loan will have a regular rate. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Limited Resource Interest Rate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If you have an operating loan (OL) or a farm ownership (FO) loan,it may be possible for you to get ``limited resource loan interest rate.''For OL loans, the limited resource loan rate is 3 percent below the regularrate. For farm ownership loans, the limited resource loan rate is between5 percent and an amount that depends on what it costs the government toborrow money. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Interest Rate for Loan Servicing </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When loans are consolidated, rescheduled, or reamortized, the interestrate on the new loan will be either the interest rate on the original loanor the current regular rate of interest for the type of loan, whicheveris less. The borrower may be able to get the limited resource interestrate on OL or FO loans. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For information about current interest rates, contact the county FmHAoffice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(5) Loan Deferral </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Payments of principal and interest can be temporarily delayed forup to 5 years. You must show that you cannot pay essential living expensesor maintain your property and pay your debts. You must also show you willbe able to pay at the end of the delay period. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The interest rate on a deferral loan will be either the current rateof interest for loans of the same type or the original rate on the loan,whichever one is lower. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The interest that builds up during the delay period will not be addedto the principal of the loan. You must pay this interest in equal yearlypayments for the rest of the loan term. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>You can only get a loan deferral if the FmHA decides options1-4 will not work for you. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>FmHA Softwood Timber Programs. Marginal land including highlyerodible land and pasture can be planted in softwood timber. If you qualify,a debt of up to $1000 an acre can be deferred up to 45 years. Interestwill be charged during the deferral period. The debt must be paid whenthe timber is sold. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Conservation Easements. Use of highly erodible land, wetlands,or wildlife habitat can be signed over to the Secretary of Agriculture.The Secretary will reduce the debt by the value of the land or by the differencebetween the value of the land and the amount you owe, whichever is larger.The amount of land left after the set aside must be enough to continuethe farming operation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(6) Debt Write-Down </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This means the debt you owe is reduced. FmHA can reduce both the principaland interest of the debt. The debt can be reduced to the recovery valueof the property mortgaged to FmHA to get the loan. This property is calledcollateral. The recovery value is the value of the collateral minus allof the attorney, management, resale, and other expenses FmHA would haveif they foreclosed on and sold the collateral. These expenses include paymentson other loans against the collateral that FmHA would have to pay if itforeclosed and sold the collateral. The value of the collateral must bedecided by a qualified appraiser. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In order to get debt write-down, you must show that you will haveenough money to pay all of your living and farming operating expenses andscheduled debt payments. This includes making payments on the FmHA loanonce part of the loan is written down. This means you must show that youhave a feasible plan of operation. FmHA will never write down more of thedebt than is necessary for you to show a feasible plan. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The write-down is used only when the loan servicing programs listedin programs 1-5 above alone will not be enough for you to show a feasibleplan. If you get loan servicing, some of the principal and interest onyour loan(s) will be written down in addition to changing the payback period,and possibly the interest rate, using programs 1-5 above. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">II. Who Can Qualify for Primary Loan Service Programs </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">To qualify you must prove that: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) You cannot repay your FmHA debt due to circumstances beyond yourcontrol.

The CountySupervisor will decide whether you can pay as much or more on the loanas FmHA would get if they foreclosed and sold the collateral for the loan.To do this, the County Supervisor must decide whether you can pay at leastas much as the ``recovery value'' explained above. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">How Soon Will You Know? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Within 60 days from the day you apply you will get a copy of the CountySupervisor's analysis and decision. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Can You Get Your Debts Written Down? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Only if FmHA will get as much or more by writing down part of yourdebt than it will get if it forecloses and sells the collateral for theloan. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Conditions of the New Agreement if You Qualify </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">You must sign a shared application agreement. The agreement asks youto: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Repay a part of the sum written down. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The amount depends on how much your real estate collateralincreases in value. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The shared appreciation agreement will not last longer than10 years. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">During this 10 years, FmHA will ask you to repay part of the debtit wrote down if you do one of the following things: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Sell or convey the real estate. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Stop farming. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Pay off the entire debt.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If you do not do one of these things during the 10 years, FmHA willask you to repay part of the debt written down at the end of the 10 years.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">FmHA can only ask you to repay if the value of your real estate collateralgoes up. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the first four years of the agreement, FmHA will ask you to pay75 percent of the increase in value of the real estate. In the last 6 years,it will ask you to pay only 50 percent of the increase in value. However,FmHA can never ask you to pay more than the amount of the debt they wrotedown. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Mediation of Other Loans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If you cannot show a feasible farm plan because you owe too much toother creditors and suppliers, FmHA will help you try to get your othercreditors to adjust your debts. This will be done by FmHA asking for mediationif your state has a mediation program approved by the Department of Agriculture.If there is no state mediation program, FmHA will try to set up a meetingwith your other creditors and suppliers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Date to Begin Agreement </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If you are found eligible, you will be informed of the date for anappointment so your debt can be adjusted.

The planwill outline the necessary site preparation, planting practices, environmentalprotection practices, tree varieties, the harvesting projection, the planneduse of the timber, etc. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) The following requirements must also be met:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) If the borrower is otherwise eligible, the County Supervisor mustdetermine that a feasible farm plan as defined by Subpart B of Part 1924of this chapter on the present farm operation is not possible without usingthe provisions of this section. The County Supervisor must calculate theborrower's plan of operation, using the maximum terms for the rescheduling,reamortization and deferral authorities set out in this subpart. If a feasibleprojection can be achieved by using any of these authorities, the borrower'saccount will be rescheduled, reamortized or deferred, as applicable. LimitedResource rates must be considered, if the borrower is eligible, in determiningwhether a feasible plan can be achieved. The County Supervisor must documentthe steps taken to develop these cash flow projections and must place thisdocumentation in the borrower's case file. A copy of this documentationmust also be given to the borrower. If a feasible plan is shown, the borroweris not eligible for a reamortization of a distressed loan(s) as set outin this section. The borrower will be given an opportunity to appeal theFmHA denial, as provided in andSection; 1951.909(i) of this subpart afterthe County Supervisor determines the borrower's eligibility for the otherservicing programs in this subpart.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) If a feasible plan cannot be developed on the present farm operation,the County Supervisor will determine if a feasible plan would be possibleby deferring and reamortizing a portion of one or more distressed FP loansas ST loans. The ST loan is limited to the loan amount (rounded up to thenearest $1,000) sufficient to produce a feasible plan. However, the amountof the loan cannot exceed the $1,000 per acre specified in paragraph I(C)(7) of this exhibit. The borrower, with assistance from the County Supervisor,must be able to develop a feasible farm plan for the first full crop yearof the deferral.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) When a loan is reamortized the accrued interest more than 90 daysoverdue will be capitalized. Payments may be deferred for up to 45 yearsor until the timber crop produces revenue, whichever comes first, exceptas required in paragraph VIII (B) of this section. If income is available,payments will be required as determined in paragraph II (B)(4) of thisexhibit. Repayment of such a reamortized loan shall be made not later than46 years after the date of the reamortization unless the borrower qualifiesfor a further reamortization as authorized in section IX (H) of this exhibit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) If assistance is granted, an annual plan will be developed eachyear to determine if there is any balance available to pay interest and/orprincipal on ST loans before the deferral period ends. If a balance isavailable, the borrower will sign Form FmHA 440-9, ``Supplementary PaymentAgreement.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Applicable requirements of Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chaptermust be met.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) If a borrower has requested an ST loan that has a portion of thedebt set-aside under this subpart, the set-aside will be cancelled at thetime the reamortization is granted. The borrower may retain the set-asideon other loans. A borrower who requests a reamortization of a distressedset-aside loan must agree in writing to the cancellation of the set-aside.The written agreement must be placed in the borrower's case file.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(D) If the total amount of the distressed FP loan(s) exceeds $1,000per acre of the marginal land designated for softwood timber production,the FP loan must be split. The split portion of the loan may not exceed$1,000 per acre for the marginal land. A new mortgage will be requiredto secure this portion of the loan unless the FmHA State supplement allowsotherwise. The mortgage must ensure that FmHA has a security interest inthe timber. The remaining balance of such a split loan will be securedby the remaining portion of the farm and such other security previouslyheld as security prior to the split. Separate promissory notes will beexecuted for each portion of the split loan.

Within thirty days after the site visit,a report will be developed by the review team and provided to the CountySupervisor. The report will cover the items listed in paragraphs (A) through(F) of this paragraph. The report will be prepared by an organization,selected by FmHA, that has indicated its willingness to be the enforcementauthority except in the instance discussed in paragraph (C) below. Wheneverreview team members have differing positions on any items to be addressedin the report, each team member will prepare a separate report and submitthese reports to the organizations responsible for the report. These differingviews will be noted in the report. When no differences exist within thereview team, written summaries of team members' positions need not be submittedto the preparer of the report unless either the preparer requested themor an individual team member desires to submit a report. The items to beaddressed in the review team report are:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) The amount of land, if any, which is wetland, wildlife habitat,upland or highly erodible land and the approximate boundaries of each typeof land. If applicable, easement boundaries may be recommended which gobeyond the wetland, upland, or highly erodible land but are necessary foreither the establishment of identifiable easement boundaries or are requiredfor the efficient management of the easement's terms and conditions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) A finding of whether the land is suitable for conservation, recreationand/or wildlife habitat purposes and a priority ranking of purposes included,if the land can be so classified and ranked. First, priority will be givento land easement opportunities to benefit wildlife species of Federal Trustresponsibility (e.g., migratory birds and endangered species) and theirhabitats (e.g., wetlands). Special consideration will be given to opportunitiesto benefit a combination of conservation, recreation and wildlife habitatpurposes. When there are other land easements already established or underreview within the local area and the intent of these easements has beenestablished, the review team will consider these actions as purpose rankingsare developed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) The name of the qualified enforcement authority which is willingto be assigned enforcement authority for the easement as well as the name(s)of any entity(s), if known, that the enforcement authority may use to managethe easement.

The management plan will outlinethe various management alternatives for the proposed easement. The enforcementauthority's eventual selection of the alternative(s) to be followed willbe based upon future needs, fund availability, and identification withinthe management plan. The management plan will provide guidance as to theconservation practices to be followed and the costs which may occur inthe establishment and maintenance of the easement. This management planwill specifically recommend whether or not public recreational use and/orpublic hunting should be allowed on the easement and provide supportingreasons for the recommendation(s) made. Whenever changes are required inthe management plan, the enforcement authority, with the concurrence ofFmHA, may update the management plan to reflect the changes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(F) The recommended term length of the easement. See paragraph VIof this exhibit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">V. FmHA's review of easement team's report.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Upon receipt, the County Supervisor will review the easement team'sreport. If the report indicates that an easement is not feasible giventhe nature of the land, or the failure of a qualified entity to volunteerto become an enforcement authority, the County Supervisor will inform theborrower of the reason(s) that the easement has been denied and that theborrower may appeal the denial of the easement. If the report is favorableto an easement and more than one qualified entity has indicated its desireto be an enforcement authority, the County Supervisor will select a Federalentity over a non-Federal entity since the easement involves reductionof a Federal debt. If two Federal agencies each want to be the enforcementauthority, the County Supervisor will select the Federal agency that ownsor controls property adjacent to the easement or the Federal agency whosemission or expertise best matches the priority use purpose(s) for whichthe easement would be established.

In no instance will the total debt cancellation exceed themaximum value as calculated in paragraph (VII) Step 6 of this section.If the borrower would not be able to develop a feasible plan, the CountySupervisor will notify the borrower of the reason that the easement hasbeen denied and that the borrower may appeal this adverse decision afterthe County Supervisor has decided whether the borrower qualifies for theadditional servicing programs in this subpart.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) <T3>Updating the title opinion. </T3>Title examination will be the sameprocedure as provided for in andSection; 1807.2 (a) and (b) of Part 1807of this chapter (FmHA Instruction 427.1). A preliminary title opinion willnot be required. The final title opinion will cover the period followingthe recordation of the initial loan mortgage. Title opinion costs willbe considered nonrecoverable costs and will be paid by FmHA by completingand submitting a Standard Form 1034 and plus a Form FmHA 2024-1 for paymentin accordance with andSection; 2024.753(c) of FmHA Instruction 2024-P (Instructionsand forms are available in any FmHA office).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(D) <T3>Consent of other lienholders.</T3> If there are any prior or juniorlienholders, their consent to the terms of the easement must be obtainedin writing by the borrower. The consent will be filed in the borrower'scase file and need not be recorded unless required by State law. No changein the terms can be proposed by the prior or junior lienholders. If itis not possible to obtain the lienholders' consent, the easement will bedenied and the borrower so informed. The borrower will have no appeal rightsfor an FmHA denial on this basis.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(E) <T3>Identifying the boundaries of the easement.</T3> A professional surveyof the easement's boundaries will be required. FmHA will provide this serviceby contracting for the survey in accordance with FmHA Instruction 2024-A,Exhibit J (available in any FmHA office).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(F) <T3>Reaching an agreement with the borrower.</T3> The borrower will beinformed of the easement's value, the impact on the remaining financialobligation, and the terms and conditions of the easement. The borroweralso will be provided a copy of the easement review team's report. If theborrower decides to give the easement, approval will be made by the CountySupervisor, the enforcement authority, and the borrower by signing FormFmHA 1951-39, ``Grant of Easement,'' if the enforcement authority is theU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or Form FmHA 1951-39A, ``Grant of Easement,''if the enforcement authority is other than the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,or a similar form approved by the Office of General Counsel (OGC). (TheseFmHA forms are available in any FmHA office.) A similar form may not containprovisions whose purposes conflict with the purposes of this regulationor with the terms of Forms FmHA 1951-39 or 1951-39A. If the borrower requestsa modification of the proposed easement, such modification cannot conflictwith the purpose or purposes for which the easement would be established.The County Supervisor cannot approve a modification of the proposed easement'sterms and conditions without first obtaining the concurrence of the enforcementauthority. If the modification is substantial, in terms of the easementreview team's recommendations, the members of the easement review teammust be consulted. If an agreement cannot be reached with the borroweron the easement's terms and conditions, the County Supervisor will notifythe borrower in writing that the easement is denied and that the borrowermay appeal this denial after the County Supervisor determines the borrower'seligibility for the other servicing options in this subpart.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(G) <T3>Recording of noncash credit.</T3> Upon approval of the easement, theCounty Supervisor will complete Form FmHA 1951-47, ``Farmer Program NoncashCredit for Purchase of Easement Rights,'' for entry into the FmHA fieldoffice terminal system. The borrower's loans that were closed prior toDecember 23, 1985, that are secured with the real estate on which the easementis obtained, will be credited with an amount not to exceed the establishedvalue of the easement acres. The amount credited will be applied on theFmHA loan(s) in order of priority of lien on the security and then on anyother FmHA debts. The loan may be reamortized if needed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(H) <T3>Recording of the easement.</T3> The County Supervisor will record FormFmHA 1951-39 or Form FmHA 1951-39A (or other acceptable form that has beenapproved by OGC) to comply with State laws. The County Supervisor thenwill retain a copy of the easement in the borrower's file and will providea copy of the easement to the enforcement authority and to the borrower.Cost of recording the easement will be considered a nonrecoverable costand will be paid by FmHA by completing a Standard Form 1034 and submittingForm FmHA 2024-1 for payment in accordance with andSection; 2024.753(c) ofFmHA Instruction 2024-P (Instructions and forms are available in any FmHAoffice).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">VIII. Violation of terms and conditions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If the borrower violates any of the terms or conditions of the easement,the account will be liquidated in accordance with andSection; 1965.26(b)of Subpart A of Part 1965 of this chapter. The borrower will also be responsiblefor all costs incurred by FmHA and the enforcement agency in the courseof enforcing such terms and conditions. Enforcement expenses may includeattorney's fees, costs of any litigation, and the cost of repair or restorationof the easement land to a condition compatible with conservation, recreationaland wildlife purpose(s) for which the easement was established. Shouldthe borrower wish to convey or sell the property subject to the easementduring the term of the easement, the borrower must first notify the enforcementauthority and the purchaser(s) will also be responsible for the same typeof costs should the successor(s) violate the terms and conditions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">IX. Responsibilities of the enforcement authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The enforcement authority will be named in any approved easement andonce named agrees to accept the following responsibilities and duties:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) Upon receipt of an FmHA approved easement, provide FmHA with alegally binding document acknowledging its acceptance of the role as enforcementauthority for that easement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) Monitor compliance with the easement's terms and conditions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) Ensure that the easement property is safely maintained to theextent required by relevant State law and accept all liabilities associatedwith implementing and carrying out its management responsibilities underthe easement's terms and conditions and management plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(D) At its discretion, delegate or contract management functions toone or more management authorities, with all associated cost being theresponsibility of the enforcement authority or the management authority,as agreed in that contract. Monitoring Compliance with the terms and conditionsof the easement cannot be so delegated or contracted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(E) For the first five years of the easement's life, report annuallyto FmHA on the status of compliance with the easement's terms and conditions.Thereafter, this report must be provided every five years. If circumstancesdevelop which would result in substantial compliance problems or claims,or litigation involving the easement property, then the enforcement authorityimmediately must notify FmHA by certified letter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">X. Monitoring compliance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The enforcement authority is responsible for monitoring compliancewith the easement's terms and conditions and management plan. However,when under the circumstances stated in the easement's terms and conditions(Form FmHA 1951-39 and Form FmHA 1951-39A), the grantor needs the Government'swritten authorization to proceed with an action, a written request forsuch authorization must be provided by the grantor to the County Supervisor.In order to provide the requested written authorization, the County Supervisormust determine that the request does not violate the easement's terms andconditions and must receive the written concurrence of the enforcementauthority. In reaching this determination, the County Supervisor shouldconsult with the State Director and OGC, as necessary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">Exhibit I_Guidelines for Determining Adjustments for Net RecoveryValue of Collateral</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This Exhibit provides guidance to State Directors and County Supervisorsfor determination of the factors to be used in adjusting current marketvalue.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">State Director Responsibilities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The State Director's analysis and guidance to County Supervisors willspecify costs which are determined to be consistent state-wide, and providespecific guidance on the determination of costs which are somewhat consistentwithin the state but may vary on a County to County or property to propertybasis. All studies or surveys should be conducted so that all necessaryinformation can be distributed at the same time.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">A. </ITAG><T3>Real Estate Costs</T3><ITAG tagnum="21">The analysis and guidance for liquidation and disposition costs should,as a minimum, address the following items and considerations:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Management Costs. In situations where State or District wide contractsfor management of inventory farms are in effect, the State Director willspecify those rates to be used in management cost calculations. Generally,those costs should be specified on an annual per-acre basis or annual incomepercentage basis. If there are no wide area contract rates for some orall counties, guidance should be given as to how to calculate rates basedupon local costs. Such guidance should include customary management activitiesand their frequency to promote a consistent approach.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Local and Administrative Costs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) The State Director will consult with the appropriate RegionalCounsel in charge to determine the average amount of government attorneytime involved in an involuntary liquidation. This time, in hours, willbe multiplied by $75 per hour to arrive at the legal costs associated withinvoluntary liquidations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The FmHA Resource Management System (RMS) work standards (FmHAInstruction 2006-J, Exhibit A, available in any FmHA office) for liquidationactions should be used to determine the administrative costs associatedwith liquidation for each type of loan, as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(RMS standard divided by 60) andmultiply; hourly rate for GS-11/1 =administrative cost of liquidation. The administrative costs during inventoryshould also be derived from the RMS standards. It will be necessary todetermine the average number of property management actions per month perproperty, and compute the cost as follows: (average actions per propertyper month andmultiply; average holding period andmultiply; (RMS standard forproperty management actions divided by 60) andmultiply; GS-11/1 hourly payrate) + (RMS standard for sale actions divided by 60) andmultiply; GS-11/1hourly pay rate = administrative costs for inventory period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Average holding period for suitable property. Normally, the averageholding period will be determined to be the average months in inventoryfor suitable properties as derived from report code 597, Farmer ProgramInventory. However, in situations where states have no suitable inventory,or have a very limited number of suitable properties for which the holdingtime is not representative, (i.e., one property held 75 months due to locallitigation) the average of the holding periods of surrounding states shouldbe used. National Office guidance may be requested in such cases.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Resale Expenses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Commissions_A study will be conducted, at least annually, to determinethe typical method for disposition of FmHA inventory farms in the state.The findings will be used to determine whether commissions should be includedas resale expenses, or whether FmHA normally disposes of inventory farmswithout the assistance of brokers or auctioneers. However, if a CountyOffice is covered by an exclusive listing agreement or contract for auctioneeringservices, commissions will <T3>always </T3>be included as a resale expense in that office. The percentageof commission will be the rate specified on the listing agreement(s) orcontract(s) in effect for the County Office.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Repairs_Guidance will be issued as to the kinds of repairs whichare considered essential for typical properties in the state. Additionally,County Offices should be advised to obtain specific guidance in unusualcases.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Yearly percentage decrease or increase in value. To provide afair assessment of projected trends in farm land values, each State Directorwill establish a farm land market advisory committee (FLMAC). The committeewill consist of the FmHA State Director, the State Executive Director ofthe Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), the StateConservationist for the Soil Conservation Service (SCS), and an ExtensionSpecialist from a Land Grant University (if available) or other AgricultureExtension Service employee with knowledge of the farm real estate market.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The FLMAC will meet at least each July, and will consider at leastthe following information:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) The actual change in farm land values in the state during theprevious year, as indicated in the most recent ``Agricultural Land Valuesand Markets Situation and Outlook Report'' issued by the USDA EconomicResearch Service.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Current conditions in the state and national agricultural economics.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Availability and cost of credit to purchase farm land.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) The amount of repossessed farm land held by FmHA, the Farm CreditSystem, and other private sector lenders.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) Any special conditions which would effect farm land values inthe state.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(f) Any studies or research conducted by the State Agricultural Universityor similar scholarly source.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The FLMAC should, if possible, determine anticipated value changeson a regional basis within the state, if the state has agricultural regionswith discernable differences.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The committee's meetings and decisions, including the basis for thosedecisions will be documented, retained in the State Office as part of theState supplement and provided to interested parties upon request.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Prior to providing the FLMAC determinations to FmHA field offices,the State Director will contact the FmHA State Directors in surroundingstates to determine if the committee's findings are fairly consistent withthose of surrounding states. If there are significant differences, theState Director may reconvene the committee to reconsider its findings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">B. </ITAG><T3>Chattel Costs</T3><ITAG tagnum="21">FmHA rarely acquires chattel property because it can be sold muchmore quickly and easily than real estate. Therefore, the average holdingperiod for chattel property will be zero, unless significant acquisitionsoccur and the Administration determines that chattels do have a holdingperiod.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Legal and Administrative Costs. The procedures outlined for determiningthese expenses for real estate loans will be followed, except that RMSwork standards and other factors for chattel loans should be used.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Resale Expense.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Commissions_A study will be conducted, at least annually, to determinetypical and reasonable commission rates for sales of chattel property inthe state. The results of the study will be provided as guidance to fieldpersonnel.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Repairs_Guidance should be issued as to the kinds of repairs requiredfor resale.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">County Supervisor Responsibilities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The County Supervisor will use the state-wide costs and give carefulconsideration to the cost and other guidance provided by the State Director.The County Supervisor will determine certain localized liquidation costsbased upon guidance in the supplement at least annually after receipt ofthe State supplement. These figures will be documented and provided toborrowers upon request.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. Management Expense. If the County Office is not covered by Stateor District wide property management contracts, the management expenserates will be based upon local level contract rates, based upon the guidanceprovided in the state supplement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. Advertisements. The County Supervisor will contact at least onelocal newspaper to obtain a cost for advertising inventory farms in accordancewith FmHA Instruction 1955-C.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. Repairs. Approximate costs for typical essential repairs may bedeveloped, considering the guidance in the state supplement. Repair itemsmust be related to physical condition (i.e., roof, windows, doors, etc.)and not to functional or economic obsolescence.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">D. Commissions, A survey of auctioneers will be made to determinethe average commission rate for chattel sales in the area. Real Estatecommissions, if any, will follow the state supplement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">E. Legal Expense. A survey of local closing agents will be performedto determine the cost FmHA will incur for closing transactions (title opinions,recorder's fees and the like).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">F. Miscellaneous. Miscellaneous expenses such as land surveys whichare routinely incurred should be determined by local survey and documented.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Income</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Income will be added to net recovery value only when it is relativelycertain that the income will be realized. Lease income will not be plannedunless a lease is already in effect at the time the calculations are beingmade, and it appears that the lease will continue after FmHA acquires title.The amount of mineral or other lease or royalty income will be based uponthe historical record of such income generated by the property. Chattelswill not generate income unless they have a holding period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Depreciation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The amount of depreciation anticipated for buildings and other improvementswill be based upon the summation value and estimated remaining life ofthe improvement as reflected in the real estate appraisal. For example,a dwelling with a summation value of $40,000 and a remaining life of 20years will depreciate at a rate of $2,000 per year. The depreciation calculationswill be documented in the borrower's case file and provided to the borrowerupon request. Chattels will not be depreciated unless they have a holdingperiod.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">Exhibit J_The Debt and Loan Restructuring System (DALR$)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) primary loan service programs providea large number of alternatives for restructuring an FmHA loan. The numberof loans a borrower has increases the number of combinations of possiblealternatives. It is difficult and extremely time consuming to manuallycalculate all the potential combinations of servicing actions. To assurethat the various combinations of programs are considered, FmHA has developedthe Debt and Loan Restructuring System (DALR$) for operation of the CountyOffice computer system. FmHA personnel will not manually perform the calculationsin this Exhibit. This Exhibit is provided as a benefit to those who maywant to perform manual calculations, or understand the procedures DALR$goes through.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">What is DALR$?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">DALR$ is a computerized decision support tool. This means that thecomputer assists the FmHA loan officer in making a decision. For example,FmHA regulations specify criteria for determining the interest rate whenloans are restructured. DALR$ will select an interest rate using the criteriain the regulations. Judgement decisions are made by the FmHA loan officerin evaluating the Farm and Home Plan and other information entered intothe DALR$ system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">DALR$ Operating System</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">DALR$ operates on the ATandamp;T 3B2 computer system in FmHA field offices.It runs under the UNIX (registered tm, ATandamp;T) computer operating system.DALR$ also utilizes Prelude (registered tm, Venturcom) for data entry andstorage functions. To operate DALR$, UNIX System V, version 2.0.5 and Preludeversion 2.1 are required.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">FmHA developed DALR$ to run under UNIX and Prelude because those systemshave the capabilities necessary to allow for relatively rapid development,and are available in all FmHA offices. DALR$ will not run under DOS onpersonal computers. Due to lack of resources, FmHA does not plan to developduplicate computing capabilities on personal computers. FmHA will providecopies of program diskettes and/or source code to interested parties uponrequest.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Advantages of DALR$</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The DALR$ system provides several benefits to FmHA borrowers:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Speed of calculation. Calculations which would take hours or daysare reduced to minutes. This not only speeds the processing of servicingrequests, but provides the flexibility to consider several alternativeplans of operation within the same time constraints.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Consistency. The use of DALR$ assures that all calculations willbe performed in the same way, and that the feasibility of all requestswill be evaluated on the same calculation methods.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Full consideration. DALR$ considers primary loan service programsand combinations of those programs for every borrower entered into thesystem. Thus, borrowers can be assured that they will be considered foras many of these actions as necessary to develop a feasible plan, if afeasible plan is possible.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Reduction of errors. Use of DALR$ greatly reduces the potentialfor errors and inadvertent denial of assistance due to those errors. DALR$eliminates errors in the calculations. The only potential errors relatedto the calculations are input errors, which are much easier to detect andcorrect than calculation errors. It is important to note, however, thatDALR$ results are only as reliable as the input data.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">What DALR$ Does</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">DALR$ performs a series of mathematical calculations based upon predeterminedcritera. These same calculations and procedures would be followed whencalculations are performed manually. DALR$ also generates a printed summaryof its computations for FmHA and the borrower.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Overview</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In arriving at a debt restructuring plan, DALR$ will take advantageof all primary loan service programs to maximize the borrower's abilityto repay debt and remain on the farm and avoid loss to the government.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Several combinations of primary loan service programs may be necessaryto keep the borrower on the farm and avoid losses to FmHA. DALR$ will examineeach combination until a feasible plan is reached or it is determined afeasible plan is not possible with full utilization of primary serviceprograms.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">DALR$ considers each primary serving option in the order describedbelow until an appropriate solution is found. Each step increases FmHA'slevel of assistance to the Borrower and, when applicable, includes theprimary loan service programs provided by previous steps.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Apply payments, including proceeds from the sale of non-essentialassets, which the borrower plans to apply to outstanding FmHA debt.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Reschedule/reamortize loans at maximum terms with interest ratesat the minimum or original note interest rate or regular loan program rate.Loans may be considered for consolidation in accordance with andSection;1951.909of this subpart prior to being entered into the DALR$ system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Reschedule/reamortize loans at maximum terms with interest ratesat the minimum of original note interest rate or applicable limited resourceloan program rate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Defer loans at the maximum term and minimum interest rate permittedby program regulation until a feasible plan is obtained in the first year.Loans are selected for deferral so as to minimize debt repayments in theyears after the deferral period. If deferral of a loan will result in anexcess cash flow margin in the first year then a partial deferral of theloan is used to eliminate the excess cash flow margin. A partial deferralhas the added benefit of reducing the payment amount in the years afterthe deferral period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Provide Softwood Timber loan deferral, when requested by borrower,to the maximum limits permitted by program regulations. Loan deferralswill be recalculated selecting Softwood Timber loans first so as to:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Minimize any decrease in present value caused by conversion toSoftwood Timber loans, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. If regular deferrals are still needed to facilitate a feasibleplan in the first year, minimize the increase in payments in the year afterthe expiration of deferral period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A Softwood Timber loan deferral has the same effect on existing FmHAdebt repayment as a full write down of the same amount of debt. A SoftwoodTimber loan deferral, however, will always have a greater present value.Therefore, after a loan is selected for Softwood Timber deferral it willnot be considered for write down since this will always reduce presentvalue.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. Write Down_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Write down loans in the order, at the interest rates, and in combinationwith other primary loan service programs to maximize the ability of theborrower to remain on the farm and avoid FmHA loan losses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">a. Conservation Easements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Conservation Easement write-down (when requested by the borrower)will be considered over debt write-down whenever such FmHA Instruction1951-S consideration will not prevent development of a debt restructuringplan which will keep the borrower on the farm.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">b. Security Considerations</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The FmHA County Supervisor will evaluate each loan and determine itswrite-down priority considering the degree of collateralization. Loanswhich are secured but have no collateral value will generally be selectedfor write down before loans which are at least somewhat collateralized.There are three write-down security/collateral categories.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Low: These loans may be secured or unsecured and have no collateralvalue.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Medium: These loans are secured but do not have sufficient collateralvalue to fully protect the Government's interest.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) High: These loans are secured and fully collateralized; the Government'sinterest is fully protected.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">c. Methodology</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Method 1 (See Section VI B of this exhibit) will be used firstto develop an acceptable restructuring plan which will keep the borroweron the farm. If a restructuring plan is not found which will keep the borroweron the farm then Method 2 (See Section VI C of this exhibit for a fulldescription) will be used to develop a restructuring plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) For both Method 1 and Method 2 loan terms will be the maximumpermitted by program regulations. Also, write down amounts will be calculatedso that the ``Balance Available'' to repay debt is equal to or as closeas possible to the ``Debt Repayment''.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Loans selected for regular deferral will remain deferred, butwill be fully or partial written down if needed to obtain positive cashflow margins. Loans converted to Softwood Timber loans (if requested) willremain Softwood Timber loans and will not be written down because writingdown Softwood Timber loans decreases present value.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. If a restructuring plan is not found to keep the borrower on thefarm, the borrower, FmHA County Supervisor, and other Lenders may reevaluate/reworkthe borrower's farm plan to increase income, reduce other debt, sell non-essentialassets, improve security on FmHA debt, and consider Softwood Timber loansand Conservation Easements (if not originally requested by the Borrowerand is permitted by program regulation).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Each of these measures will increase the computed present value. DALR$will use the new/revised information provided by the borrower and the FmHACounty Supervisor to assure that the restructuring of existing FmHA debtwill maximize the potential for the borrower to repay debt and remain onthe farm and avoid FmHA loan losses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Iterative Calculation Process</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">I. Existing Loan Interest Rates</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. Obtain status information on each loan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The status information date (accrual date) must be a date after thelast payment or other transaction on the loan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Principal balance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Accrued interest balance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Non-capitalizable interest balance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. For each loan compute the interest accrual to the proposed effectivedate for servicing actions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Interest Accrual=P andmultiply; Iex andmultiply; N-DAYS.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. ``P'' is the outstanding principal balance on the date on whichloan status information was obtained.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. ``Iex'' is the daily interest accrual (decimal equivalent) basedon the existing interest rate for the loan. Daily interest accrual is equalto the existing annual interest rate divided by 365.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. ``NDAYS'' is the number of days between the effective date andthe status information date. If February 29 occurs between these two daysit is not added to the number of days.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. Determine the amount of Non-capitalizable accrued interest.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Deferred loans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">All accrued interest is non-capitalizable interest.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Other loans:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Interest less than 90 days past due is non-capitalizable interest.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">II. Regular Program Interest Rates</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. Determine balance of funds available for debt repayment in thenext planning year. This is the ``Balance Available in Year 1''. If loandeferrals are anticipated or are needed, also determine the Balance Availablefor debt repayment in the year after the end of the specified deferralperiod.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. Determine total debt repayment in the next planning year. Thisis the ``Debt Repayment in year 1.'' If loan deferrals are anticipatedor are needed, also determine the debt repayment in the year after theend of the specified deferral period. Included in this amount are:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. New loans:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">New loans planned may affect repayment in the first planning yearand/or the year after the end of the specified deferral period, dependingon when the loan will be made and the repayment term. The equal annualpayments on these new loans are included in the debt repayment calculations.Regular program interest rates (not limited resource rates) are used forall new loans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Note: In subsequent steps the regular loan program interest rate ischanged to limited resource rates, if it is determined that it is not possibleto develop a feasible plan at regular program rates.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. FmHA Loan for annual operating expenses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Repayment of FmHA loans for annual operating expenses are based onregular loan program interest rates.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Included in this amount is the annual operating expense loan principalwhich is due in the applicable planning year.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Interest accrual on this loan may be estimated by multiplying theprincipal to be paid in the applicable planning year by the regular loanprogram interest rate (monthly decimal equivalent) and then by the averagenumber of months the principal will be outstanding.

Deferrals Period. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Deferral will only be beneficial if the cash flow margin will improveafter the deferral period. This improvement must begin no later than sixyears after the current planning year, since the maximum deferral periodis 5 years. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. To determine the appropriate deferral period the County Supervisorand borrower will review the farm operation over the next five years. Loansshould be deferred to the year when the improvement from the first planningyear is the greatest and the improvement in the following years are atleast as good. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. It is not necessary that deferrals provide a positive cash flowmargin after the deferral period because it is still possible to obtaina positive cash flow margin with a combination of deferrals, debt writedown and the other primary loan service programs. However, to maximizethe potential for the borrower to remain on the farm and avoid losses onFmHA loans, a new farm plan must be prepared by the FmHA County Supervisorand borrower for the year after the end of the selected deferral period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. If there is no anticipated improvement in cash flow margin, thena deferral year plan need not be prepared since other combinations of primaryservice programs will maximize the potential for the borrower to remainon the farm and avoid losses on FmHA loans. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. Deferrals. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Criteria. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Loans which have been rescheduled/reamortized previously in DALR$will be rescheduled/reamortized at the same interest and term. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Other loans which have not been previously rescheduled/reamortizedin DALR$ will be rescheduled/reamortized as follows: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Loans will be rescheduled/reamortized over the maximum term permittedby program regulation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The interest rate will be the minimum of: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) the original note interest rate. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) the loan program interest rate (limited resource, if applicable)in effect on the date of the servicing action calculations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Interest payments which are 90 days or more past due will be addedto the principal balance to form a new principal balance to be rescheduled/reamortized.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Interest less than 90 days past due will be spread equally overthe new loan term and will be added to the repayment amount of the newrescheduled/reamortized debt.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Loan Selection. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This selection process will assure that after a positive cash flowmargin is achieved in the 1st year, the cash flow margin in the year afterthe deferral period will be the greatest. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Calculate the payment after the deferral period for each loan eligiblefor deferral. This is only a side calculation to determine the best orderof selection. A deferral will decrease the payments in the 1st planningyear and increase the payments in the year after the deferral expires.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. For each loan compute the ratio of the increase in ``after deferralperiod'' payment to the decrease in 1st year payment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The loan with the smallest ratio is deferred first and so on untilthe balance available is greater than or equal to debt repayment in year1.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The Process. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Taking one loan at a time, defer the selected loan, recompute thedebt repayment in year 1. Also compute the debt repayment in the year afterthe end of the deferral period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. If the balance available is equal to debt repayment in year 1 andthe balance available is greater than or equal to debt repayment in theyear after the end of the deferral period then no further servicing actionsare required. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. If the balance available is greater than the debt repayment inyear 1, then this implies that the last loan deferred did not require afull deferral. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Compute amount of deferral of the last loan necessary to achieveequality between balance available and debt repayment in year 1. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Recompute payments for this loan during the deferral period andthe years after the expiration of the deferral period. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) If the balance available in the year after the deferral periodis greater than or equal to the debt repayment then no further servicingactions are required. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Partial Deferrals. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Whenever deferral of a loan results in an excess cash flow marginin the first year, a partial deferral of that loan will result in a higherpresent value and will also decrease future payments on that loan. SeeAttachment 1 to this Exhibit for applicable formulas for partial deferrals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Examples: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Case 1: Partial Deferral without Write Down. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Situation: A full deferral is more than is needed to achieve a positivecash flow margin in year 1. A full payment on the loan will produce a negativecash flow margin in year 1. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Process. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Determine amount of deferral of necessary to achieve a feasibleplan in the first year.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``d'' is the fraction of the loan which must be deferred. This fractionis applied to both the principal (P) and the non-capitalizable interest(N). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``r'' is the amount of cash flow margin in the first year with a fulldeferral. ``R'' is the debt repayment on the loan in the first year withoutdeferral.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d_1_(r/R). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Calculate Portion of debt to be deferred and portion of non-deferreddebt to meet cash flow margin criteria in the first year. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Non-deferred portion. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">P<T2>1</T2>=(1-d) x P=(r/R) x P. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">N<T2>1</T2>=(1-d) x N=(r/R) x N. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Deferred Portion </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">P<T2>2</T2>=P-P<T2>1</T2>. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">N<T2>2</T2>=N-N<T2>1</T2>. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Case 2: Partial Deferral with Write Down. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Write down is required for a feasible plan. In this situation thewrite down and partial deferral must yield a payment which exactly meetsthe borrower's ability to repay debt. This will maximize the ``PresentValue'' and the borrower's ability to remain on the farm. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Situation: The loan is partially deferred to achieve a feasible planin the 1st year. The payments in the year after the end of the deferralperiod exceed the borrower's ability to pay even with a partial deferral.Write down is necessary to achieve a feasible plan. The loan which is partiallydeferred has been selected as the next loan to write down based upon writedown selection criteria. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Write down sequence: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The non-capitalizable interest (of the deferred portion of theloan) will be written down first until a feasible plan is achieved or thenon-capitalized interest (of the deferred portion of the loan) is fullywritten down.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The remaining principal (on the deferred portion of the loan) isthen written down until a feasible plan is achieved or the principal isfully written down.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. At the point the deferred portion of the loan has been fully writtendown, but a feasible plan has not yet been found. The subject loan is nowa non-deferred loan with reduced principal and reduced non-capitalizableinterest. This new loan must now compete for selection for write down withall remaining loans based on the write down selection criteria.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">V. Softwood Timber</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. Criteria.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Loan terms will be the maximum permitted by program regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The interest rate will be the minimum of:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. the original note interest rate, or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. the Softwood Timber program interest rate which will be in effecton the date of the servicing action calculations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Interest payments which are 90 days or more past due will be addedto the principal balance to form a new principal balance upon which interestwill accrue over the Softwood Timber deferral period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Interest less than 90 days past due will not be capitalized andaccrue interest, and will be payable at the end of the Softwood Timberdeferral period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. The rescheduled/reamortized principal amount plus any non-capitalizedinterest of Softwood Timber loans will not exceed the maximum amount permittedby program regulation or the amount needed to develop a feasible plan,whichever is less.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. Loan Selection.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Loans will be selected for the Softwood Timber loan program to maximizethe present value after conversion to Softwood Timber, thus avoiding loanlosses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Cancel all previously calculated deferrals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. For each loan compute the present value before and after conversionto a Softwood Timber loan. Then compute the decrease in present value (note:for loans in which the present value increases this will be negative number).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. For each loan compute the ratio of the decrease in present valueto the decrease in first year repayment after conversion to a SoftwoodTimber loan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Select the loan with the smallest (or most negative) ratio first.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. If loans have equal ratios select the loan having the least securityamong these loans first, Softwood Timber loans will have new security instruments.This will improve the FmHA security and could increase present value ifwrite down is required for other loans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. The Process.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Starting with the first loan in the list of loans ordered to minimizedecrease in present value convert the loan to Softwood Timber.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Continue this process until the maximum limit for Softwood Timberconversion is reached or a feasible plan is possible in the first year.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. If a loan is only partially converted then create a new loan identityfor the partially converted loan. The portion not converted retains thesame interest rate and term prior to the conversion to Softwood Timber.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. If fully utilizing Softwood Timber loan conversion authoritiesdo not result in a feasible plan in the first year rework the loan deferralcalculation described in Section IV of this exhibit (if applicable). Donot include the loans selected for Softwood Timber loans in the reworkingof the deferral calculations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. If conversion to a Softwood Timber loan will permit a feasibleplan to be developed (with or without deferrals) no further servicing actionsare required.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">VI. Write-Down</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Write-down of loans will proceed with Method 1 (contained in VI B)first.

Conservation Easement write-down.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Starting with the first loan selected for conservation easementwrite-down, determine whether a full write-down will permit a feasibleplan in the applicable year. The applicable year is the first planningyear if deferrals have not been considered. If deferrals have been consideredit is the year after the end of the deferral period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) If a full conservation easement write-down will achieve positivecash flow compute the amount of conservation easement write-down so thatthe balance available equals debt repayment. Reschedule/reamortize theloan for the new principal amount.

Starting with the first loan selected for debt write-down, determinewhether a full write-down will result in a positive cash flow margin inthe applicable year. The applicable year is the first planning year ifdeferrals have not been used. If deferrals have been used, it is the yearafter the deferral period. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. If a full debt write-down results in a positive cash flow computethe amount of write-down so that the balance available equals debt repayment.Reschedule/reamortize the loan for the new principal amount and test presentvalue with net recovery value. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">D. Net Recovery Value Test </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Conservation Easements have been requested.

All other loans written down were based on conservation easementauthority. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. If the present value of the repayment on remaining FmHA debt equalsor exceeds the net recovery value of collateral a debt restructuring planhas been found which will keep the borrower on the farm and no furtherserving actions are required. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. If a full write-down of a loan does not achieve a positive cashflow margin in the applicable year continue selecting loans for write-downand repeat this process until a positive cash flow margin is obtained inthe applicable year or there are no other loans left to write-down. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">VII Net Recovery Value </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">DALR$ computes the net recovery value of collateral to obtain a valueto use for the net recovery value test outlined in section VI C3b of thisexhibit, as required in andSection; 1951.909(f) of this subpart. See ExhibitI, ``Guidelines for Determining Adjustments for Net Recovery Value of Collateral,''for guidance in determining the value of specific items in the net recoveryalue calculations outlined have. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Net recovery value is computed for all FmHA Farmer Program loan security.If FmHA's lien position or the amount of prior liens vary from item toitem, separate net recovery values will be computed for each item whichhas a different lien structure. Example: FmHA has a first lien on a borrower'sequipment, except for two tractors. One tractor was financed by non-FmHAcredit, and FmHA has a junior lien subject to the purchase money financing.In the case of the second tractor, FmHA subordinated its lien to anotherlender to finance repairs, thus, FmHA has a junior lien subject to theamount subordinated.

FmHA will not make a demand on a borrowerto voluntarily convey. If there is equity in the property, FmHA shouldadvise the borrower in writing that there is equity in the property beforeaccepting an offer to voluntarily convey. If FmHA receives an offer ofvoluntary conveyance, acceptance should only be considered when the Governmentwill likely receive a recovery on its investment. In cases where thereare outstanding liens, a full assessment should be made of the debts againstthe property compared to the current market value. If the FmHA lien hasneither present nor prospective value or if its enforcement would be unlikelyor uneconomical, FmHA should refuse the voluntary conveyance. Instead,for loans to individuals, FmHA should release its lien as valueless inaccordance with andSection; 1965.25(d) of Subpart A of Part 1965 of thischapter or andSection; 1965.118(c) of Subpart C of this chapter, as appropriate.For non-FP borrowers, a voluntary conveyance should only be consideredafter all available servicing actions outlined in the respective servicingregulations have been used or considered and it is determined that theborrower will not be successful. For FP borrowers, if the borrower hasnot received Exhibit A with Attachments 1 and 2 of Subpart S of Part 1951of this chapter, a voluntary conveyance should be accepted only after theborrower has been sent Exhibit A with Attachments 1 and 2 of Subpart Sof Part 1951 of this chapter; all available servicing actions outlinedin the respective program servicing regulations have been used or considered;and it will be in the Government's best financial interest to accept theFP voluntary conveyance. Exhibit G of this subpart, ``Worksheet for Determiningthe Recovery Value of Farmer Program Real Estate Security,'' will be usedto determine whether or not to accept an FP voluntary conveyance. In determiningif the acceptance of the FP voluntary conveyance is in the best financialinterest of the Government, the County Supervisor will determine if theborrower has exhausted all possibilities of restructuring the loan to wherea feasible plan of operation may be developed, the borrower has acted ingood faith in trying to service the debt and FmHA may recover its costin return for the acceptance of the voluntary conveyance. Those borrowerswho are indebted for nonprogram (NP) loans who wish to voluntarily conveyproperty will not be sent Exhibit A with Attachments 1 and 2 of SubpartS of Part 1951 of this chapter. For Farmer Program borrowers who have receivedExhibit A with Attachments 1 and 2 of Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapter,a voluntary conveyance should only be accepted when it is determined tobe in the Government's best financial interest. Rejection of an offer ofvoluntary conveyance made before or after acceleration from an FP borroweris appealable. For borrowers having both FP and non-FP loans secured bya farm tract, a voluntary conveyance should be handled as outlined abovefor non-FP loans secured by farm tracts, except that the applicable servicingoption for the FP and non-FP loans should be considered separately.

For Farmer Program loans, the CountySupervisor will document the determination on Exhibit G of this subpart.The decision must be made far enough in advance of expiration of the redemptionperiod to permit exercise of the Government's rights. If the property isto be redeemed, complete information documenting the basis for not acquiringthe property at the sale and factors which justify redemption of the propertywill be included in the case file.

Refer to andSection;1955.53 of this subpart for guidance. (a) <T3>Property other than housing. </T3>Property which secured loans or wasacquired under the CONACT will be classified as suitable or surplus. Farmproperty will be classified by the applicable County Committee. Propertyacquired under the CONACT which is originally classified as suitable maybe reclassified as surplus because of physical damage such as fire, flood,sheet erosion or falling water table, which occurs, or change in economicconditions such as rising cost of production inputs, viable market outletsand obsolescence, which affect its suitability for program purposes, or,if not sold within three years after acquisition, it must be declared surplus.The 3-year period will be extended to compensate for any period of timethe property was withheld from the market because its sale may have hada negative impact on farm real estate values or other administrative reasons.Form FmHA 1955-3A must be processed to update a change in the propertysuitability classification.

The County Committee decisionwill be documented on Form FmHA 440-2, ``County Committee Certificationor Recommendation.'' In addition, a map of the property showing the newboundaries will also be attached to Form FmHA 440-2. The County Supervisormay also group two or more individual properties into one or more suitablefarm properties based on recommendations from the County Committee. Theenvironmental effects will also be considered pursuant to Subpart G ofPart 1940 of this chapter. Also refer to andSection; 1955.140 of SubpartC of this part.

(c) <T3>Housing property. </T3>Property which secured housing loans will beclassified as ``program'' or ``nonprogram.'' Location, size, design, possiblehealth and safety risks to occupants, and functional and economic obsolescencemust be considered in determining suitability. It is not intended to classifyan otherwise-program dwelling as nonprogram simply because it containsmore than 1400 square feet of living area or design features which wouldnot be permitted in a new dwelling or an existing dwelling not in the FmHAprogram. Although a property can be made program, repairs necessary torender it so must be economically feasible. Ordinarily, the cost of repairsshould enhance the value so that the return on investment will be as greator greater than it would be if the repairs were not made. SFH propertyoriginally classified as program may be reclassified as nonprogram if physicaldamage occurs which is not economically feasible to repair. Form FmHA 1955-3Amust be processed to update a change in the property suitability classification.Where a SFH property is situated on land in excess of a minimum adequatesite as defined in andSection; 1944.11 of Subpart A of Part 1944 of thischapter, a determination must be made as to whether the excess land canserve as a minimum adequate site for another dwelling. It is not intendedto classify an otherwise-program dwelling as nonprogram solely becauseit is situated on more than a minimum adequate site. Consideration mustbe given to such things as zoning requirements, road or street access,and marketability of portions separately, if subdivided. If the excessland cannot be sold separately as a minimum adequate site for another dwelling,the property may be sold as a single tract to an eligible applicant.

Exceptions to this policy are authorized only when a prospectivebuyer has indicated a willingness to buy ``as is'' and make needed repairswith his/her own resources or with a subsequent loan made simultaneouslywith the credit sale, or when the property is likely to be vandalized beforeit can be sold. Nonprogram property which does not meet the ``decent, safe,and sanitary'' (DSS) standards outlined in andSection; 1955.103 of SubpartC of this part will be repaired to meet those standards when economicallyfeasible; otherwise, the restrictions on occupancy as set forth in andSection;1955.116 of Subpart C of this part will apply. To be economically feasible,repairs should increase the expected ``as is'' sale price by at least thecost of the repairs. (2) <T3>MFH. </T3>MFH property should be evaluated to determine if repairsare necessary or if a prospective buyer may wish to rehabilitate the propertyafter purchasing it in an ``as is'' condition. Property which does notmeet the DSS standards outlined in andSection; 1955.103(f) of Subpart C ofthis part is subject to the occupancy restrictions set forth in andSection;1955.116 of Subpart C of this part. (3) <T3>Farm property.</T3> Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section,only the farm service buildings and facilities typically essential forthe type of farming in the area will be repaired, renovated, and/or improvedas necessary to place the farm in marketable condition. Conservation ofsoil, water and forest resources will be considered and actions will betaken to correct severe problems upon advice of the Soil Conservation Service(SCS), through the development of conservation practices for the farm property.The County Supervisor will request that the SCS identify the location ofany highly erodible land and recommend specific conservation practicesto control erosion. The County Supervisor will carry out those conservationpractices that are essential to preserve and protect the property and toplace it in marketable condition. Any differences between FmHA and SCSregarding the need for a certain practice will be resolved in the mannerindicated in andSection; 1955.137(c)(2) of Subpart C of this part. Recommendationswill also be requested from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regardingfish and wildlife conservation measures. See Exhibit A of FmHA Instruction2000-LL (available in any FmHA office) for further information. (4) <T3>Property other than housing and farms. </T3>Each property will be evaluatedindividually to determine whether repairs should be made or the propertyoffered for sale ``as is.'' The State Director will obtain advice fromthe appropriate division in the National Office as necessary in makingthese determinations. (b) <T3>Authority.</T3> Program and contracting authority is contained in FmHAInstruction 2024-A (available in any FmHA office). <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1955.65 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Management of inventory and/or custodial real property.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Authority._</T3>(1) <T3>County Supervisor.</T3> The County Supervisor, with the assistanceof the District Director and State Office program staff as necessary, willselect the management method(s) used for property which secures (or secured)loans to individuals as defined in this subpart. (2) <T3>State Director.</T3> The State Director will select the managementmethod to be used for property which secures (or secured) loans to organizationsas defined in this subpart. The State Director shall also provide guidanceand assistance to County Supervisors and District Directors as necessaryto insure that property under their jurisdiction is effectively managed.(b) <T3>Management methods. </T3>Management methods and requirements will varydepending on such things as the number of properties involved, their densityof location, and market conditions. Management tools which may be usedeffectively range from contracts to secure individual property, have thegrass cut, or winterize a dwelling; a simple management contract to providemaintenance and other services on a group of properties (including butnot limited to specification writing, inspection of repairs, and yard anddirectional signs and their installation), or manage an MFH project; blanket-purchasearrangement contracts to obtain services for more than one property; toa broad-scope management contract with a real estate broker or managementagent which may include inspection and specification-writing services,making simple repairs, obtaining lessees, collecting rents, coordinationwith listing brokers in marketing the properties and effecting evictionof tenants when necessary. A contractor may handle evictions only whereState laws permit the contractor to do so in his/her own name; a contractormay not pursue eviction in the name of the Government (FmHA). Custodialproperty may be managed in the same manner as inventory property exceptthat it may be leased only if it is habitable without repairs in excessof those authorized in andSection; 1955.55(c) of this subpart. Farm or organizationproperty, such as rental housing and community facilities, may be operatedunder a management contract if the State Director has determined it isapproporiate to have the property in operation. In any case, the primaryconsideration in selecting the method of management to be used is to protectthe Government's interest. If property to be operated or leased under amanagement contract is located in an area identified by the Federal InsuranceAdministration as a special flood or mudslide hazard area, lessees or tenantsmust be notified to that effect in accordance with andSection; 1955.66(e)of this subpart. A management contract which covers property in such ahazard area may provide for the contractor to issue the required notices. (c) <T3>Obtaining services for management and/or operation of properties.</T3>Services for management, repair, and/or operation of properties will beobtained by contract in accordance with FmHA Instruction 2024-A (availablein any FmHA office).(1) <T3>Management contracts.</T3> Management contracts are flexible instrumentswhich may be tailored to meet the specific needs of almost any situationinvolving custodial or inventory property. This type of contract may beused to manage and maintain SFH properties, farms, and any other type offacility for which FmHA is responsible. Organization-type properties willbe secured, maintained, repaired, and operated if authorized, in accordancewith a management plan prepared by the District Director and approved bythe State Director if the amount of total debt does not exceed the StateDirector's loan approval authority, or by the Administrator. For MFH, thisplan should follow the guidance provided by Subpart C of Part 1930 of thischapter. An audit of the borrower's records may be required if recent financialinformation is not available. For MFH projects, tenant occupancy and selectionwill be in accordance with the occupancy standards set forth in SubpartC of Part 1930 of this chapter. Tenants will be required to sign a writtenlease if one does not exist when the property is acquired or taken intocustody. If a contract involves management of an MFH project with 5 ormore units, or 5 or more single-family dwellings located in the same subdivision,the contractor must furnish Form HUD 935.2, ``Affirmative Fair HousingMarketing Plan,'' subject to FmHA's approval. Contracts for managementof farm inventory property will be offered on a competitive bid basis,giving preference to persons who live in, and own and operate qualifiedsmall businesses in the area where the property is located in accordancewith the provisions in Exhibit J, paragraph II C, ``Procurement PreferenceProgram,'' of FmHA Instruction 2024-A (available in any FmHA office). (2) <T3>Authority to enter into management contracts.</T3> (i) The County Supervisormay enter into a management contract for basic services involving farmsor not more than 25 single-family dwellings; however, the aggregate amountpaid under a contract may not exceed the contracting authority limitationfor County Supervisors outlined in FmHA Instruction 2024-A (available inany FmHA office).(ii) A District Director may enter into a management contract for basicmaintenance and management services for an MFH project within the contractingauthority outlined in FmHA Instruction 2024-A (available in any FmHA office).The aggregate amount of any contract may not exceed that contracting authority.(iii) A CO in the State Office may enter into a management contract forbasic services involving more than 25 single-family dwellings, a more complexmanagement contract for SFH property, or an appropriate contract for managementor operation of farm or organization-type property. The aggregate amountpaid under a contract may not exceed the contracting authority limitationfor State Office staff outlined in FmHA Instruction 2024-A (available inany FmHA office).(iv) If a proposed management contract will exceed the contracting authorityfor State Office staff within a short time, a request for contract actionwill be forwarded to the Administrator, to the attention of the appropriateprogram division. (3) <T3>Specification of services. </T3> All management contracts will providefor termination by either the contractor or the Government upon 30 dayswritten notice. Contracts providing for management of multiple propertieswill also provide for properties to be added or removed from the contractor'sassignment whenever necessary, such as when a property is acquired or takeninto custody during the period of a contract or when a property is soldfrom inventory. If a contractor prepares repair specifications, that contractorwill be excluded from the solicitation for making the repairs to avoida conflict of interest. If a management contract calls for specificationwriting services, a clause must be inserted in the contract prohibitingthe preparer of his/her associates from doing the repair work. Examplesof both basic and more complex management contracts are included in ExhibitA to FmHA Instruction 2024-A (available in any FmHA office).(4) <T3>Costs. </T3> Costs incurred with the management of property will bepaid according to FmHA Instruction 2024-P (available in any FmHA office)by completion of Form AD 838 or SF 1034 and processing Forms FmHA 2024-1or FmHA 838B, as appropriate in accordance with the respective FMIs. Formanagement of custodial property, costs will be charged to the borrower'saccount as recoverable; and for management of inventory property as nonrecoverable.Except for management fees, costs of managing MFH inventory property whentenants are still in residence will be paid to the extent possible withrental income. Management fees will be paid to the manager by use of SF1034 or AD 838 and processing Forms FmHA 2024-1 or FmHA 838B, as appropriate,according to the respective FMIs. (d) <T3>Additional management services. </T3> Additional types of managementservices and supplies for which the State Director may authorize acquisitioninclude: Appraisal services (except for MFH), security services, newspapercopy preparation services, market data and comparable list acquisition,and tax data acquisition. If the State Director believes there is a needto acquire other services not listed in this paragraph or authorized elsewherein this subpart, the State Director should make a written request to theAssistant Administrator (appropriate program) for consideration and/orauthorization. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1955.66 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Lease of real property. </ITAG>When inventory real property, other than MFH properties, cannot be soldpromptly, or when costodial property is subject to lengthy liquidationproceedings, leasing may be used as a management tool when it is clearlyin the best interest of the Government. Leasing will not be used as a meansof deferring other actions which should be taken, such as liquidation ofloans in abandonment cases or repair and sale of inventory property. Leaseswill provide for cancellation by the leasee or FmHA on 30-day written noticeunless Special Stipulations in an individual lease for good reason provideotherwise. If extensive repairs are needed to render a costodial propertysuitable for occupancy, this will preclude its being leased since repairsmust be limited to those essential to prevent further deterioration ofthe security in accordance with andSection; 1955.55(c) of this subpart. Therequirements of Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter will also be metfor all leases.(a) <T3>Authority to approve lease of property_</T3>(1) <T3>Custodial property.</T3> Custodial property may be leased pending foreclosurewith the servicing official approving the lease on behalf of FmHA.(2) <T3>Inventory property.</T3>_(i) <T3>SFH.</T3> The County Supervisor may approve the lease of single-familydwellings.(ii) <T3>MFH.</T3> MFH projects will generally not be leased, although individualliving units may be leased under a management agreement. After the propertyis placed under a management contract, the contractor will be responsiblefor leasing the individual units in accordance with Subpart C of Part 1930of this chapter. In cases where an acceptable management contract cannotbe obtained, the District Director may execute individual leases.(iii) <T3>Farm property.</T3> (A) Any property which secures an insured loanmade under the CONACT and which contains a dwelling (whether located onor off the farm) that is possessed and occupied as a principal residenceby a prior owner who was personally liable for a Farmer Program loan mustfirst be considered for Homestead Protection in accordance with SubpartS of Part 1951 of this chapter. In addition, the former owner, spouse andchild(ren) of the former owner and any entity members must first be consideredfor leaseback/buyback in accordance with Subpart S of Part 1951 of thischapter.(B) The County Supervisor may approve the lease of farm property when afeasible plan of operation can be developed in accordance with andSection;1924.57 of Subpart B of Part 1924 of this chapter.(C) When a lease with an option to purchase is signed, the lessee shouldbe told that FmHA cannot make a commitment to finance the purchase of theproperty in the future. Except for leases with an option to purchase, specialstipulations will be made a part of farm leases to provide that the Governmentmay terminate the lease in order to sell the farm, but in that event andthe lessee will retain the right to harvest growing crops and rental paymentwill be prorated between the Govenment and the purchaser of the property.(D) The County Supervisor shall report all leases of farms to the localAgricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) office and allsubsequent changes in leases or sale of the property.(E) Chattel property will not normally be leased unless it is attachedto the real estate as a fixture or would normally pass with the land.(F) The property may not be used for any purpose that will contribute toexcessive erosion of highly erodible land or to the conversion of wetlandsto produce an agricultural commodity, as further explained in Exhibit Mof Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter. All prospective lesses willbe notified in writing of the presence of highly erodible land, convertedwetlands and wetlands on inventory property. This notification will enclosea copy of Form SCS-CPA-26, ``Highly Erodible Land and Wetland ConservationDetermination,'' which identifies whether the property contains wetlandor converted wetland or highly erodible land. The notification will alsostate that the lease will contain a restriction on the use of such propertyand that FmHA's compliance requirements for wetlands, converted wetlands,and highly erodible land are contained in Exhibit M of Subpart G of Part1940 of this chapter. If converted wetlands are present, the notificationwill also state that FmHA will not lease converted wetlands for the purposeof producing an agricultural commodity. Additionally, a copy of Form SCS-CPA-26will be attached to the lease and the lease will contain a special stipulationas provided on the FMI to Form FmHA 1955-20, ``Lease of Real Property,''prohibiting the use of the property as specified above.(iv) <T3>Organization property other than MFH.</T3> Only the State Director,with the advice of appropriate National Office staff, may approve the leaseof organization property other than MFH, such as community facilities,recreation projects, and businesses. Lease of utilities may require approvalby State regulatory agencies. OGC assistance will be requested in preparationof the lease for property in this category.(b) <T3>Selection of lessees for other than farm property.</T3> When the propertyto be leased is residential, a special effort will be made to reach prospectivelessees who might not otherwise apply because of existing community patterns.A lessee will be selected considering the potential as a program applicantfor purchase of the property (if property is suited for program purposes)and ability to preserve the property. The leasing official may requireverification of income and/or a credit report (to be paid for by the prospectivelessee) as he/she deems necessary to assure payment ability and creditworthinessof the prospective lessee.(c) <T3>Selection of lessees for farm property</T3>_(1) <T3>Farm plans.</T3> All prospective lessees will be required to submita farm plan for the upcoming crop year and to submit evidence of theirincome. The County Supervisor must determine that the prospective lesseehas the financial resources and farm management skills and experience thatare sufficient to assure a reasonable prospect that the terms of the leasecan be fulfilled. The County Supervisor may require verification of incomeand/or a credit report (to be paid for by the prospective lessee).(2) <T3>Racial and ethnic consideration.</T3> In accordance with the policiesset forth in Exhibit B of Subpart A of Part 1943 of this chapter, the approvalofficial will make a special effort to insure that those prospective lesseesare reached in the marketing area who traditionally would not be expectedto lease FmHA farm inventory properties or apply for farm ownership loanassistance because of existing racial or ethnic prejudice. Emphasis willbe placed on providing technical assistance to such socially disadvantagedindividuals in accordance with the applicable sections of Subpart A ofPart 1910 of this chapter.(3) <T3>Rights of previous owner and notification.</T3> For leaseback/buybackrights of former borrower/owners, refer to Subpart S of Part 1951 of thischapter. Grazing Association, Indian Land Acquisition, and other organizationtype loans as defined in andSection; 1955.53 of this subpart, are not subjectto the leaseback/buyback and Homestead Protection provisions of SubpartS of 1951 of this chapter.(d) <T3>Property securing Farmer Program loans located within an Indian Reservation.</T3>(1) If real property securing a Farmer Program loan is located within anIndian Reservation and the owner or former owner is a member of such Indiantribe, such member-owner will be offered leaseback/buyback rights pursuantto Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapter. State Directors will contactthe Bureau of Indian Affairs Agency supervisor to determine the boundariesof Indian Reservations and Indian allotments. A State supplement will beissued to identify the boundaries of such Indian Reservations and Indianallotment lands. If the former owner is a member of the tribe and doesnot want to exercise leaseback/buyback rights, the spouse and childrenof the former member-owner will be offered leaseback/buyback rights pursuantto Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapter. The previous operator of propertylocated within an Indian Reservation whose former owner is a member ofthe tribe having jurisdiction of such property is not entitled to leaseback/buybackrights and will not be notified.(2) The tribe of which the former owner is a member will also be notifiedby letter, similar to Exhibit B of this subpart, at the time FmHA acquiresthe property, of the potential of such member-former owner's property beingavailable for leaseback/buyback and advise the tribe of additional leaseback/buybackpriority rights as follows (unless the tribe shall have established a differentpriority order for these additional leaseback/buyback rights): (i) To an Indian member of the Indian tribe that has jurisdiction overthe reservation within which the real property is located; (ii) To an Indian corporate entity; (iii) To the Indian tribe.

(4) If the real property is not leased or purchased by any individual,Indian corporate entity or Indian tribe pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and(d)(2) and all appeals have concluded, the State Director shall transferthe property to the Secretary of the Interior. (5) Properties within a reservation formerly owned by entities and non-tribalmembers will be treated as regular inventory that is not located on anIndian Reservation and disposed of pursuant to this subpart and SubpartC of this part. Leaseback/buyback rights will be given to the former owner,spouse, or children of the former owner, as well as any previous operatorsas outlined in Subpart S of Part 1951 of this chapter. (e) <T3>Lease amount. </T3>Inventory property will be leased for an amountequal to that for which similar properties in the area are being leasedor rented (market rent). In no case will inventory property be leased fora token amount. (1) <T3>Farm property. </T3>The County Supervisor will make a survey of leaseamounts of farms in the immediate area with similar soils, capabilities,and income potential to arrive at a market rent amount. While cash rentis preferred, lease of a farm on a crop-share basis may be approved ifthis is the customary method in the area. If the lease amount is to bea share of the crop, this must be outlined in detail in Special Stipulationsin the lease in accordance with the FMI for Form FmHA 1955-20, ``Leaseof Real Property.''

The new property,together with any proceeds applied to the FmHA indebtedness, will havea value to FmHA at least equal to the value of the lien formerly held byFmHA on the old security.(vi) Proceeds can be used to preserve the security because of a naturaldisaster or other severe catastrophe, when the need for funds cannot bemet by other means or with an FmHA loan or an FmHA loan cannot be madein time to prevent the borrower and FmHA from suffering a substantial loss.(vii) Property can be exchanged for property which is better suited tothe borrower's need if FmHA will acquire a lien on the new property, atleast equal in value to the lien held on the property exchanged. (viii) Property can be consumed by the borrower as follows: (A) Livestock can be used by the borrower's family for subsistence. (B) If crops serve as security and usually would be marketed, the CountySupervisor can allow such crops to be fed to livestock, provided, thisis preferable to direct marketing and also provided that FmHA obtains alien (or assignment) on the livestock and livestock products at least equalto the lien on the crops.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *  </ITAG>(5) If a borrower wants to dispose of chattel security which is not listedon Form FmHA 1962-1 or wants to dispose of chattel security in a way notlisted in the ``How'' section or wants to use proceeds in a way not listedin the ``Use of Proceeds'' section on Form FmHA 1962-1, the borrower mustobtain FmHA's consent before the disposition or before the proceeds areused. FmHA <T3>must</T3> give consent for the release of normal income security ifthe change is necessary for the borrower to meet essential family livingand farm operating expenses. FmHA<T3> must</T3> also give consent if the conditions set out on the formand in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are met. The borrower may obtainprior consent by telephoning the county office, by letter, by visitingthe county office, or by any other method the borrower chooses. When revisionsare agreed to over the telephone, the County Supervisor<T3> must</T3> revise the Form FmHA 1962-1 contained in the borrower'scase file, initial and date the change, and mark the form ``Revised.''The County Supervisor will then either write to the borrower and send acopy of the ``Revised'' form to the borrower asking the borrower to dateand initial the change and return the form to the county office, or theCounty Supervisor will ask the borrower to date and initial the changethe next time the borrower is in the county office. Changes that wouldresult in a major change (examples of major changes are: Feeder pig tosow operation, cow/calf to feeder steer operation, dairy to row crop, etc.)in a borrower's operation will always require a visit to the county officeso that the County Supervisor and the borrower can complete a new farmand home plan and revise Form FmHA 1962-1. The County Supervisor will beresponsible for determining if the requested change is major or not.

Exhibit E to Subpart A is added to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="85">Exhibit E_Releasing Security Proceeds and Determining ``Essential''Family Living and Farm Operating Expenses</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73"> Family Living Expenses</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> Expenses for household operating, food, clothing, medical care, houserepair, transportation, insurance and household appliances. i.e., stove,refrigerator, etc., are essential family living expenses. We do not expectthere will be any disagreements over this. However, when proceeds are lessthan expenses, there might be disagreements about the amounts FmHA shouldrelease to pay for particular items within these broad categories. Forexample, FmHA has to release for transportation expenses, but should FmHArelease so that a borrower can buy a new car? If, at planning time, itappears that there will be sales proceeds available to pay for the borrower'soperating and living expenses, including the expense of a new car, theForm FmHA 1962-1 can be completed to show that FmHA plans to release fora new car. On the other hand, it would also be proper to complete the FormFmHA 1962-1 to release for a used car or for gas and repairs to the borrower'spresent car. If it is necessary for FmHA to release for essential familyliving expenses and because transportation is an essential family livingexpense, some proceeds must be released for that broad purpose. However.nothing requires us to release for a specific expense; usually, there willbe several ways to use proceeds to provide for essential family livingexpenses. We must provide the borrower with a written decision and an opportunityto appeal whenever there is a disagreement over the use of proceeds orwhenever we reject a request for a release.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Farm Operating Expenses</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We would expect farm operating expenses to present more of a problemthan family living expenses. There will probably be a few disagreementsover whether an expense is an operating expense (as opposed to a capitalexpense), but it is more likely that there will be disagreements over theamount FmHA should release for operating expenses and over whether a particularfarm operating expense is ``essential.'' As is the case with family livingexpenses, disagreements will most likely arise when proceeds are less thanexpenses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To resolve disputes over the amount to be released, remember thatwe must be reasonable and release enough to pay for essential farm operatingexpenses. Although a borrower might not always agree that enough moneyis being released, if the borrower's essential farm operating expensesare being paid, we are fulfilling the requirements of the statute. We mustprovide the borrower with an opportunity to appeal when there is a disagreementover the use of proceeds or when we reject a request for a release.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">FmHA Instruction 1962-17 of FmHA Instruction 1962-A states that essentialexpenses are those which are ``basic, crucial or indispensable.'' Whetheran expense is basic, crucial or indispensable depends on the circumstances.For example, feed is a farm operating expense, but it is not always anessential expense. If adequate pasture is available to meet the needs ofthe borrower's animals, feed is not essential. Feed is essential if animalsare confined in lots. Hiring a custom harvester is a farm operating expense,but is not an essential expense if the farmer has the equipment and laborto harvest the crop just as well as a custom harvester. Hired labor isan operating expense which might be essential in a dairy operation butnot in a beef cattle operation. Payments to creditors are essential ifthe creditor is unable is restructure the debt or to carry the debt delinquent.Renting land is not essential if the borrower plans to use it to grow cornwhich can be purchased for less than the cost of production. Paying outstandingbills is essential if a supplier is refusing to provide additional creditbut not if the supplier is willing to carry a balance due. Of course, thelong term goal of any farming operation is to pay all of its expenses butwhen this is not possible, FmHA and the borrower must work together todecide which farm operating expense demand immediate attention and cannotbe neglected and those are the essential expenses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> We absolutely must release to pay for <T3>essential </T3>family living and farm operating expenses; there areno exceptions to this. When deciding whether an expense is essential andwhen deciding how much to release, the choices we make must be rational,reasonable, fair and not extreme. They must be based on sound judgment,supported by facts and explained to the borrower. Following these ruleswill help us avoid disagreements with borrowers.</ITAG>81.

Under such an Agreement, the payment will be duewhen the borrower sells the SFH property, ceases to occupy it or graduatesto another lender. After the borrower executes the Agreement, the remainingFP debt may be settled, as appropriate. An equity receivable account willbe established by the Finance Office in the amount of the Equity RecaptureAgreement, and the county office will remit collection under the Agreement,in the same manner as a SFH subsidy recapture receivable.
