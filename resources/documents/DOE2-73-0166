Terse,low level, assembler-like syntax for the language was rejected in favourof a form more familiar to physicists, namely FORTRAN. The language isknown as TWOTRAN, and is an extended subset of FORTRAN. Users write TWOTRANprograms and compile them into PDP-11 machine code using the TWOTRANcross compiler, executing on the VAX. Compiled programs are down-loadedfor execution into a CES Starburst, installed in a HYTEC System Cratebased CAMAC system. This paper describes the design of the language,from its earliest inception to its present state, and the interfacingof the language processing support system to the remainder of the dataacquisition system.</TEXT></DOC>
