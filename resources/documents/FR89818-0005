In emergentor humanitarian cases as well as those in the national interest, the Serviceand the U.S. consulates abroad may continue to use their discretionaryauthority to accept relative petitions submitted by non-residents.

Senior ImmigrationExaminer, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street NW., Room7223, Washington, DC 20536, (202) 633-5014.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On February 21, 1989, the Immigrationand Naturalization Service, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 7433) a proposed rule to revise and clarifythe process used by overseas INS offices and U.S. consulates in acceptingjurisdiction of Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative. This proposalwas made available for public comment for a thirty (30) day period endingon March 23, 1989. INS published a correction to the proposed rule on March7, 1989 at 54 FR 9459, and also extended the comment period for an additionalthirty (30) days ending on April 6, 1989.This rule has been promulgated to revise and clarify procedures for acceptingjurisdiction for processing certain relative petitions abroad. The authorityto adjudicate Forms I-130 for petitioners and beneficiaries who are physicallypresent in a consular jurisdiction was extended to U.S. consular officersof October 11, 1968. As overseas Service offices were opened abroad, thisauthority was revised to permit processing of Forms I-130 by consular officersonly when an INS office is not located in their jurisdictional area. Thisresulted in the establishment of one set of requirements for acceptanceof these cases by consular officers, and another set of requirements foracceptance by the Service; and finally to confusion by prospective applicants.To standardize procedures, the Service is promulgating this rule whichwill clarify for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Consulatesabroad, and the public, the process for filing and accepting relative petitionsabroad. Like requirements established for acceptance by Service officersabroad, a petitioner will have to reside in the consular jurisdiction beforea consular officer may accept his/her Form I-130 for processing by itsoffice. When there is an INS presence, the Form I-130 will be submittedto INS. If the petitioner is unable to show residence abroad for whichthe INS or consular officer has jurisdiction, the Form I-130 will be forwardedto the Service office which has jurisdiction over the petitioner's placeof residence in the United States. Discretionary authority to accept petitionssubmitted by non-residents in humanitarian or emergent cases and thosein the national interest will remain in effect for both INS and consularoffices.During the comment period, the Service received five comments. Two commentswere received from private law firms, one from a Service employee, onefrom an employee from the State Department, and one from a citizen's group.Most of the comments suggested minor changes and/or clarification in therulemaking which have been incorporated in the final regulation. All ofthe comments were carefully reviewed and given full consideration. A summaryof these comments and the Service response follow:(1) <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commentors requested that the countries listed in8 CFR 204.1(a)(3)(ii) be revised to include the United Kingdom and thatEngland be deleted since the INS office in London, England has jurisdictionover all countries in the United Kingdom.<T3>Response: </T3>Since the Service office in London has jurisdictionfor England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the final regulationis amended to include the United Kingdom rather than England.(2) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commentor requested clarification of the residencecriteria for the beneficiary. It was recommended that if residence wasrequired of both the petitioner and beneficiary, the regulation shouldreflect said requirement. If the beneficiary is not so required, the regulationshould reflect that the beneficiary need not be physically present or residingin the same consular district as the petitioner.<T3>Response: </T3>Although the proposed regulation requires residenceof both the petitioner and beneficiary for the consular officer to acceptjurisdiction, this issue has been reviewed once more by both the Serviceand the Department of State. Both agencies have agreed that, to standardizeprocedures, the residence requirement should be amended to permit a petitionerto file a petition with the INS or consular office having jurisdictionover the petitioner's place of residence, regardless of the beneficiary'sresidence or physical presence. The final rule is amended accordingly.(3) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commentor complained about the changes in the listof countries where consular officers are not authorized to accept jurisdictionfor processing relative petitions without notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<T3>Response: </T3>Although normal procedure is to announce changes suchas openings and closings of Service overseas offices in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the Service took this opportunity to updateits Service Office Listing in an effort to avoid further confusion by petitioners.(4) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commentor complained that the proposed rule was overlyrestrictive and that because processing in the United States may take sixto nine months, the consulate which is able to approve a petition and issuea visa within days or weeks of filing should be allowed, under specialcircumstances, to accept an I-130 relative petition although the petitionerdoes not reside in his/her jurisdiction. The following are examples ofcases cited: (a) Where beneficiary is a very young child or very old parentwho needs petitioner to care for them; (b) so-called ``orphan'' cases,where the beneficiary may not obtain a visa from his/her country of nationalitybut must find a third country to voluntarily accept jurisdiction; and (c)cases in which the qualifying marriage takes place abroad, as it makesno sense to require petitioners who are already abroad to return to theU.S. to file.<T3>Response: </T3>Since the authority to process petitions remains, bystatute, with the Attorney General, adjudication is chiefly done in theUnited States. The authority to process abroad was extended to consularofficers in an effort to assist United States citizens and lawful permanentresidents who were temporarily residing abroad due to employment, and whorequired expeditious processing due to emergent or humanitarian reasons.It was not intended to encourage petitioners to travel abroad to file petitions.With development of numerous automated systems which will cut processingtime of relative petitions and aid in clearing up backlogs at Service officesin the U.S., the final regulations have been written to permit consularofficer processing of Form I-130 only if there is no INS presence and ifthe petitioner resides in the consular jurisdiction, or if humanitarianof emergent circumstances exist.The Service and the State Department have considered various special circumstancesand have agreed to continue the acceptance of Form I-130 processing inspecial humanitarian cases. The decision to accept these cases will continueto be determined on an individual basis. The examples cited by this writermay be considered as special humanitarian cases, except for orphan caseswhich do not involve Form I-130 processing.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigrationand Naturalization Service certifies that this rule does not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities. This is not a major rulewithin the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, nor does this rule havefederalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federal Assessmentin accordance with E.O. 12612.The information collection requirements contained in this rule have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions ofthe Paperwork Reduction Act under control number andplusmin;1115-0054.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 8 CFR Part 204</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Accordingly, part 204 of chapter I of title 8, Code of Federal Regulations,is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 204_PETITION TO CLASSIFY ALIEN AS IMMEDIATE RELATIVE OF A UNITEDSTATES CITIZEN OR AS A PREFERENCE IMMIGRANT</ITAG>1.

The beneficiary need not reside in thesame jurisdiction as the petitioner for Service acceptance of the petitioner'sForm I-130. In addition, the overseas Service officer may accept a FormI-130 filed by a petitioner who does not reside within the office's jurisdictionwhen it is established that an emergent or humanitarian reason for acceptanceexists or when it is in the national interest.(iii) <T3>Jurisdiction assumed by United States consular officers. </T3>UnitedStates consular officers assigned to visa-issuing posts abroad, exceptthose in countries listed in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, areauthorized to approve any relative petition filed on Form I-130 if thepetitioner resides in the area over which the post has jurisdiction, regardlessof the beneficiary's residence or physical presence at the time of filing.In emergent or humanitarian cases as well as those in the national interest,the U.S. consular officers may use discretion in accepting a Form I-130filed by a petitioner who does not reside within the consulate's jurisdiction.While these consular officers are authorized to approve petitions, theymust refer any petition which is not clearly approvable to the appropriateService office for a decision. Consultation with the appropriate Serviceoffice abroad may be sought prior to stateside referral, if applicable.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard E.
