Throughthe authorization as the third improved and standardized plants of LWRsby the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the detailed designphase of the actual project has begun, and the improved technology tobe applied to the plants has been steadily verified and put in practicaluse. In the ABWRs, the operational capability, safety and economicalefficiency as the general characteristics of the plants were furtherheightened by simplifying, heightening the performance and compactifying.Particularly internal pumps brought about the improvement of the operationalcapability and safety of the plants together with improved control roddriving system, besides promoting the simplification and compactificationof the reactor system. Also the reinforced concrete containment vesselsconstructed into one body with the buildings have the compact structureand the solid property sufficiently withstanding hypothetical accidents,and contribute to the improvement of the economical efficiency and safety.These key improvement technologies completed their tests for practicaluse, and it was shown that the expected objectives are realized withthe characteristics of high level, thus the steady steps toward the constructionof the actual plants are promoted.
