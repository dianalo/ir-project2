The predictions NO concentrationscompare favorably with experimental measurements. Simulations were alsocompleted for entrained-flow gasification in a laboratory-scale combustor.Again, reasonable agreement is demonstrated by comparing laboratory NOmaps to predicted NO concentrations. The effects of pressure on NO concentrationswere reliably predicted. Calculations were also completed for air-stagedcombustion in a one-dimensional, laboratory-scale reactor. In general,the trend of decreasing primary zone stoichiometric ratio and variationin staging air location were correctly predicted. The simplified globalmechanism expressions of the NO model appear to sufficiently accountfor the formation and competing destruction of NO in both fuel-lean andfuel-rich environments for different reactor systems and conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
