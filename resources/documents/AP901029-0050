Conservative Prime Minister Jan P. Syse told Parliament that hisgovernment could not agree on the country's position in talksbetween the EEC and the six-nation European Free Trade Association,of which Norway is a member.   The talks are to center on the creation of a joint economicregion.   Syse had worked through the weekend, seeking common ground thatwould allow his coalition of the Conservative, Center and ChristianDemocratic parties to remain in power.   But the anti-trade bloc Center Party, with strong support fromthe country's subsidized farmers, rejected the idea of sweepingchangings in Norwegian laws that protect domestic industry andresources.   During talks on the creation of the joint economic region, theEuropean Community has pressed for changes in the Norwegian laws.The EEC claims the laws discriminate against foreigners.   The Center Party, the governing coalition's smallest member,wants continued border controls and some protection of domesticargriculture, fishing grounds and other resources.   Syse's government will remain in office until a new governmentis formed, which could take several days.   Norway's parliament was divided into nearly equal blocs ofsocialist and non-socialist blocs after Sept. 11, 1989 nationalelections, and news reports have said that the near deadlock hasmade both sides reluctant to govern.   Anders Talleraas, the Conservative's parliamentary leader, saidthe party has enouraged Syse to form a new single party governmentbecause of the small non-socialist majority.   ``I am prepared to form a new government,'' Syse said beforedelivering his government's formal resignation to Crown PrinceHarald. Norway's figurehead monarch, King Olav V, is recoveringfrom a stroke.   Syse would need backing from all four non-socialist parties.   Without it, he will likely ask former Prime Minister Gro HarlemBrundtland to form her third Labor Party government since 1981.   Her left-leaning party is the country's largest. In addition tosocialist allies, it would need backing from the Center Party toform a government.   ``It is still not clear how the new government will be madeup,'' Brundtland said in a television interview. She said Labor is``in a clear observer role, waiting to see what happens.''   When the coalition agreed on a joint platform and toppledBrundtland last year, the sensitive European Economic Communityissue was left vague.   The pro-EEC Conservatives had said they would not allow discordwithin the coalition to hamper talks.   The conflict may have been aggravated last week when neighboringSweden strongly hinted that it would seek EEC membership, promptingcalls in Norway for both countries to join the community.   Anne Enger Lahnstein of the Center Party said the issue was nolonger the joint economic region negotiations, but a battle overEEC membership.   News reports speculate that a purely Conservative governmentwould probably be short-lived. The next government will be theNorway's sixth since 1980.   Leaders have expressed fears the country could suffer frequentgovernment changes, due to the nearly deadlocked Parliament and noprovision for calling new elections.   Public disenchantment has increased due to tough austerityprograms, intended to pull Norway's oil dependent economy out of afour-year slump that has brought record unemployment.   Labor controls 81 seats in the 165-seat Parliament, including 63of its own, 17 from the Socialist Left and one independent.   The Conservatives have 37 seats, the Christian Democrats' 14 andthe Center's 11.   For a majority, the non-socialists would have to depend on thethe right-wing Party of Progress, which soared from two to 22 seatsin the last national election.   The Center Party was reportedly more willing to support a newsocialist government than allow the Progressives, which was viewedas too extremist to be invited into the Conservative-led coalition.</TEXT></DOC>
