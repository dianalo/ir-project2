RobertsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GE JAPAN LABORELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><TEXT>   General Electric Co., vowing to compete in price and quality with foreign consumer electronic giants, said it will resume some domestic production of its own color television sets, instead of buying sets from abroad.    The decision comes about a month after GE, Fairfield, Conn., said it would drop Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Osaka, Japan, as a supplier in a dispute over how the yen's sharply higher value should be reflected in prices.    The company said that later this month, it will move production of some 500,000 large-screen sets this year to the Bloomington, Ind., plant of its RCA Corp. unit from Matsushita, and spend $20 million to modernize the facility.    In 1985, before the RCA acquisition, GE had said it planned to gradually end production of its own sets in Portsmouth, Va., and to buy supplies from Matsushita. The Japanese consumer electronics giant markets sets in the U.S. under the Quasar brand name and also supplies sets for others.    In announcing its decision yesterday, GE said the move back to domestic production was made after reaching &quot;an understanding&quot; with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The understanding calls for &quot;a special joint effort&quot; to make the manufacturing plant the world's most competitive in terms of cost and quality.    GE's top consumer electronic executive, Richard W. Miller, said the company would have to resort to foreign supplies without &quot;anticipated cooperation from the IBEW membership.&quot;    GE executives and national officials of the union met Monday in Washington to hammer out the understanding. Initial talks then began between local union officials and GE plant managers in Bloomington, with more-extensive discussions planned next week. A GE spokesman said the talks will focus less on wage concessions and work rules and more on &quot;how to produce sets more efficiently.&quot;    Whether more workers will be required right away is uncertain, the spokesman said, adding that &quot;the additional volume will mean more jobs in the future.&quot; Currently, the plant employs 2,200, a level that reflects a workforce reduction because of automation at the big plant. The facility previously made sets for the RCA brand.    Mr. Miller said more than the $20 million modernization is needed. &quot;Special efforts to improve the plant's competitive position will be needed with participation by all employees,&quot; he said, &quot;if we are to solidify Bloomington as the primary source of both GE and RCA color TV receivers.&quot;    Jack J. Barry, the IBEW's international president, called cooperation with GE &quot;a good-faith understanding that both sides must work together to establish a cost competitive manufacturing environment in the U.S.&quot;    Industry analysts estimate that shifting production of the GE sets to the plant will increase output there by about 30%, indicating that RCA had been making 1.5 million RCA brand sets annually. &quot;The big thing is what it does for the factory and its competitive position,&quot; said Robert Gerson, editorial director of Twice magazine, an industry trade publication. &quot;Consumer electronics is a high-volume-dependent industry.&quot; RCA and GE are estimated to have a combined market share of about 25%.    &quot;By moving this (production) into the factory, (the two brands) should be able to match anybody in today's climate,&quot; Mr. Gerson said.    He was alluding to the dramatic rise of the yen against the dollar. The effect has been to cause Japanese manufacturing costs in dollars to climb substantially. Rather than raising prices broadly at the risk of losing market share, the Japanese have absorbed the impact of the higher yen through efficiencies and lower profit margins. GE ended its agreement with Matsushita when the Japanese company tried to pass through a price increase to GE.    Despite the move toward more domestic production, GE officials caution that foreign competitors unaffected by the yen's fluctuations &quot;continue to be a threat to U.S.-based products.&quot; Smaller GE and RCA brand television sets still are imported. </TEXT></DOC>
