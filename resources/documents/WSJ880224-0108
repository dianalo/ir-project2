Testifying before Congress, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, called the orders figures &quot;really quite strong.&quot; He suggested that they should allay fears that the recent rise in inventories meant that production was outstripping demand.    He and other economists noted that the decline primarily reflects a 12.4% drop in orders in the volatile transportation-equipment sector, which includes both aircraft and autos; orders in December rose 8.6% in that sector. Without transportation equipment, orders were up 0.7%.    Orders were up in most other industries, and the overall backlog of unfilled orders rose for the 11th consecutive month. Orders for non-defense capital goods, a closely watched barometer of capital spending, were up 1.6% after a 12.5% surge in December, a performance Mr. Greenspan called &quot;very, very impressive.&quot;    &quot;Strength in non-defense capital goods means there is already strength in other sectors,&quot; said Priscilla Trumbull, an industrial economist at WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. &quot;It means that. . . other industries are seeing enough demand to want to increase capacity,&quot; she said. Capital-goods makers also report strong demand from overseas, she added.    Some economists also were encouraged that the overall drop in orders wasn't bigger following the strong 4.1% increase in orders in December.    New orders for non-electrical machinery, a category that includes computers, were up 5.8% following a 6.3% increase in December. Electrical-machinery orders rose 5.5% after falling 2.6% in December. Orders for primary metals were off sharply, dropping 15.5% after rising 10.5% in December.    The department put total new orders in January at $112.23 billion, down from $115.51 billion in December. All the figures are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, but not for inflation.    Manufacturers' backlogs of unfilled orders climbed 0.8% in January to $392.74 billion after rising 0.6% to $389.77 billion the month before. &quot;That's kind of an insurance policy for the next few months,&quot; Ms. Trumbull said.    Shipments of durable goods fell 3.3% to $109.26 billion after rising 4.3% to $113 billion in December.    The Commerce Department's advance estimate of orders for durable goods, which are those intended to last more than three years, is often revised substantially as more data are collected. The December increase initially was estimated at 6.7% last month, was revised to 4.9% a week later and then revised further yesterday to 4.1%. </TEXT></DOC>
