The half-percentage point reduction in the discount rateto 4.5% also triggered cuts in the federal funds rate, thekey U.S. domestic money-market rate, and in the prime lendingrates of many big banks.</LP><TEXT>   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6365marks and 129.95 yen, down from 1.6393 marks and 130.05 yenlate Tuesday. Sterling was changing hands at $1.7740, up from$1.7725.   In Tokyo early Thursday, the dollar was trading at 129.73yen, down slightly from Tokyo's close Wednesday of 129.90yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.6355marks, down from 1.6427 marks at Wednesday's close.   The easing by the Federal Reserve didn't steer the dollarin a new direction, because anticipation of the move alreadyhad been factored into the currency. But traders said theforeign exchange market was surprised by the timing of thereduction, coming as it did midway through the Treasury'squarterly refunding operation.   The dollar isn't expected to rally now that the rate cutis out of the way, however. Although intervals ofdollar-buying to cover short, or oversold, positions brieflyboosted the dollar yesterday, traders said the gloomyconsensus about the U.S. economy continues to weigh on thecurrency.   The &quot;trend is still lower&quot; for the dollar, said JohnLyman, a senior customer dealer at Bank of Tokyo in New York.&quot;There is no evidence&quot; traders found dollars more attractiveafter the cut in the discount rate, or the rate at which theFed lends to commercial banks.   Traders said they expect the dollar to trade between1.6280 marks and 1.6480 marks over the next several days.   Although a discount-rate cut had seemed &quot;imminent,&quot; itwasn't really expected until after the Treasury's refundingof the federal debt ended today, said Michael Guarino,foreign exchange manager at ABN-AMRO Bank in New York.   The rate cut came just before New York trading began. Manymajor banks followed the Fed's lead by reducing their primelending rates, a key business lending rate used as abenchmark for many types of loans, to 7.5% from 8%.   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called thediscount-rate cut &quot;good news for the economy&quot; and said,&quot;Lower rates will provide stimulus for economic growth, spurincentive for business investment and increase consumerconfidence.&quot;   Traders said the federal funds rate, the rate at whichbanks make overnight loans to each other, was lowered to4.75% from 5%. Last Wednesday, the Fed steered the federalfunds rate down from 5.25%.   But the market questions whether the discount-rate andprime-rate cuts &quot;can create immediate fervor&quot; and turn theeconomy around in a few months, Mr. Guarino said. The cutsmight not be enough to induce consumers to spend, he said.   Adding to the bearish dollar sentiment was the belief thatstill more rate cuts are possible. Lower U.S. rates makedollar-based investments less attractive to foreigninvestors.   Traders said deeper cuts in the discount rate and federalfunds rate are believed to be possible if the U.S. economicpicture fails to brighten in the next few months.Fourth-quarter economic indicators will be watched closely,traders said.   Brian Doland, a trader at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. in NewYork, said the dollar isn't likely to fall below 1.62 marksunless there are bearish surprises or further interest-ratecuts. But Mr. Doland said he believes the market hasn't fullypriced in the prospect of higher German rates, makingpurchases against the mark risky.   Traders said the Bundesbank's decision not to hold a pressconference after today's policy-making Central Bank Councilmeeting has led the market to believe Germany won't raiserates immediately. But a tightening isn't out of thequestion, they cautioned, because the German central bank hasacted on interest rates in the past without scheduling apress conference.   A German rate increase &quot;would be to the furtherdisadvantage&quot; of the dollar, Mr. Doland said, attractinginvestors to mark-denominated investments.   But traders said the mark faces some pressure as theSoviet economic crisis appears to worsen.   Deputy finance ministers of the Group of Seven majorindustrialized nations -- the U.S., Japan, Germany, Britain,France, Italy and Canada -- met in Paris yesterday to discussthe Soviet Union's financial situation.   The meeting followed a news report Tuesday that thecountry might not have enough foreign currency to meet itsdebt payments for November. However, a Soviet official deniedthe report yesterday and said the payments will be made.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $354.60 an ounce, up 50 cents. Estimatedvolume was a moderate 2.5 million ounces.   In Hong Kong on Thursday, gold was quoted at $354.45 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
