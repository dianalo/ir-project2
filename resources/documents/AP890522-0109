The disagreement may not be completely settled by the timePresident Bush and other alliance leaders gather May 29-30 inBrussels to mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization.   But reassuring words by Bush and French President FrancoisMitterrand suggest the issue won't be allowed to disrupt the summit_ at least on the surface.   It's a much bigger issue in Europe, where feelings onEuropean-based nuclear weapons run sharp and deep, than in theUnited States.   Even in Europe, however, one diplomat, speaking only oncondition of anonymity, said, ``There will be something to paperover the differences so we can emerge reasonably united from thesummit.''   Richard Fieldhouse, a research fellow at the StockholmInternational Peace Research Institute in Sweden, said the issuehas become ``too steamed up,'' making it difficult to find asolution.   ``There's a bit too much enmity. ... There's a lot of politicalmaneuvering and a lot of bad blood politically,'' he said.   But Hans Binnendijk, director of studies for the InternationalInstitute for Strategic Studies, predicted a way would be found tonarrow the split in time for the anniversary gathering.   ``It is clear that (Germany) and the United States don't want tosee this thing blow up at the summit,'' he said.   Over the weekend, Bush said the dispute was a ``vexingquestion'' with differing opinions by ``strong-willed people fromstrong countries.''   However, he also said ``I think great progress has been made''and ``I think that we could well have this resolved before thesummit.''   Mitterrand, after meeting with Bush, said, ``On this problem,like on other problems, at the outset people have diverging views,differing opinions. But the important thing is to come to a meetingof the minds and to achieve a common answer. And this has alwaysbeen the case in the alliance.''   The dispute stems from a push by the United States and Britainto replace the aging Lance surface-to-surface nuclear missile witha new, more powerful weapon.   The arms campaign has become increasingly unpopular in manyEuropean countries, upbeat about the friendlier moves by SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev and reluctant to do anything to coolthe warmer East-West climate.   ``Continental Europeans are really not interested in anotherround of nuclear modernization,'' said Fieldhouse.   Politicians, he said, will have ``a hard time trying to convincethe public it's necessary.''   The United States had hoped for a strong signal of support fromthe allies for the Lance modernization program. But that nowappears highly unlikely.   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, worried about the survival of hiscenter-right government, wants to delay a decision on production ofthe new missile until 1991 or 1992 _ after important elections nextyear in Germany.   Moreover, his government unexpectedly demanded that the allianceenter into early negotiations with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact toreduce short-range, or theater nuclear weapons in Europe.   The United States and Britain have strongly opposed that,arguing the emphasis should be on East-West bargaining to slashconventional, or non-nuclear, arms in Europe.   U.S. and British officials worry that opening discussions onreducing short-range nuclear weapons would inevitably lead toremoval of all those forces from Europe.   NATO contends it maintains a nuclear stockpile as a deterrent tobalance the enormous superiority the East has built up inconventional arms.   Germany has gained support for its position _ although withvarying degrees of enthusiasm _ from Belgium, Denmark, Norway,Greece, Italy and Spain.   Gorbachev has tried to add more pressure on the Western allies.He recently promised to unilaterally withdraw 500 short-rangenuclear weapons from Europe this year.   According to Western estimates, the Soviet Union has 1,450short-range nuclear missile launchers in Europe. NATO has 88 Lancelaunchers, most based in Germany.   In their meetings, NATO officials have been trying to findacceptable language on the weapons issue to write into theComprehensive Concept, a blueprint for alliance strategy in armscontrol and force planning.   The roadmap, which will be presented to Bush and the otherleaders at the summit, lacks only a section on the allies' stand onshort-range nuclear forces.   A number of possibilities are still on the table but nocompromise solution has yet emerged, officials say.   The European diplomat suggested the officials may signal theirwillingness to enter into negotiations with the Warsaw Pact onreducing theater nuclear weapons _ but not now. Discussions wouldhinge on progress in newly opened East-West talks in Vienna onslashing conventional forces _ a position Bush has publiclyembraced.   The officials, though, could put off a decision altogether,perhaps bumping the issue to a commission, which would report itsfindings to NATO officials by a certain later.   The United States intends to go ahead with research anddevelopment for a replacement to the Lance missile. Militaryanalysts say it will be obsolete by 1995.   NATO members are: Canada, the United States, Belgium, Britain,Denmark, Germany, Greece, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, theNetherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Turkey.</TEXT></DOC>
