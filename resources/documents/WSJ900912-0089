Nazario   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/12/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A1</SO><LP>   Virginia and Rodney Bunker, white liberals from the Age ofAquarius, were certain that their adoption of needy blackchildren not only was a good deed but also moved Americacloser to true integration.   They were hardly ready for the shock they encountered atan adoption convention in St. Louis. There, before a hushedcrowd of scores of white couples cuddling their black babies,the president of the National Association of Black SocialWorkers accused them all of cultural genocide. Theirchildren, he charged, wouldn't develop black pride and ablack identity, both sorely needed to grapple with societyand racism.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There was incredible hurt in that crowd,&quot; Ms. Bunkerrecalls, the memory still vivid 18 years later. &quot;I was interrible pain.&quot; Mothers nearby, some of whom were takinghormones so they could breast-feed their babies, wept openly.Several parents were evicted as pitched, emotional argumentsover reverse racism broke out in the convention hall. Others,fearful they would destroy their babies' lives, soon gavethem back to adoption agencies.   It was a watershed event in the adoption world. The5,000-member black social workers group went on recordopposing what had become an accepted, even fashionablepractice in the activist 1960s and early 1970s. Adoptionagencies, which in 1971 had placed more than a third of theirblack infants with white parents, were loath to courtcontroversy, and many began to bar so-called transracialadoptions altogether.   But a fierce debate over transracial adoption continues,focusing attention on the fate of the Bunkers' four blackchildren and 20,000 other transracially adopted youngsters.Mounting numbers of white parents are clamoring to adopt,while tens of thousands of black children are languishing infoster care because adoption agencies either can't or, assome critics suggest, barely try to find them black parents.   &quot;Black children can rot in foster care, or they can beadopted by white families,&quot; contends Mary Beth Seader, vicepresident for the nonprofit National Committee for Adoption.Her group is lobbying to start transracial adoptions anew andremove restrictions on them in 35 states.   The studies done on transracial adoptions show mixedresults. Clearly, the children are affected by influences alladolescents face growing up: peer pressure, sibling rivalry,occasional feelings of alienation. But without doubt, thetransracial environment generates its own adjustment andidentity issues.   In many cases, the studies show the children achievingwell and developing high self-esteem. Kirsten Albrecht, whois black, was adopted as a baby by white parents. She is now19 years old and an accelerated student at the University ofChicago. &quot;I look very positively on interracial adoption,&quot;she says. &quot;I felt like I had the best of two worlds.&quot; Shesays she is loved by her parents, both ministers, and that'swhat matters.   But the research also shows that adjustment can be painfuland, often, unsuccessful. Many of the children say that beingblack in a white family impeded their efforts &quot;to belong,&quot;doubly important to an adopted child. It openly advertisedwhat they most wanted to forget: that they had been given upby their natural parents. At times, these children roamed aracial no man's land, outcasts from both black and whitesociety, a reminder of the great gap between the two worlds.&quot;These kids often don't know who they are or where they fitin,&quot; says Virginia Sturgeon, a program specialist withKentucky's &quot;special needs&quot; adoption program.   Here is how five black youngsters -- and their adoptivewhite parents -- have dealt with the complex socialexperiment of transracial adoption:                                                                                                          Nathan Hatton                                                                                                          Nathan Hatton was uncomfortable. The 22-year-old EasternMichigan University freshman had decided to spend more timewith black people, so he found himself one night at an AnnArbor bar drinking beer with black college acquaintances. Butwhen several white buddies showed up from Farmington Hills, anearby Detroit suburb where Nathan grew up, he beganfrantically switching between trying to sound black andtrying to sound white. Both groups ridiculed him for theattempts until Nathan fled, feeling humiliated.   &quot;I don't feel I'm being me around black people -- theyaren't like us,&quot; Nathan says, motioning to the three whiteschoolmates with whom he shares a dilapidated house. After heleft the bar in confusion, Nathan says, &quot;I resigned myself tonot being black. I'm not going to act something I don't wantto be. Who is to say I have to be black? It's so trivial.&quot;   Nathan's adoptive mother, Elizabeth, says she neverthought her son would grow up so confused about his race.Mrs. Hatton, a guidance counselor who often cried at thedinner table while discussing the state of public schools inDetroit, wanted a better life for Nathan. She considersherself &quot;colorblind&quot; and didn't worry about her son beingreared in a nearly all-white suburb away from others of hisrace. &quot;Color is foolishness,&quot; she says. &quot;You don't pick yourfamily and friends because of their color.&quot; Adds WilliamHatton, Nathan's adoptive father: &quot;I don't see a great dealof advantage to adopting the same race.&quot;   But from the time he was a tot, color made Nathan theoutsider. Unlike Andrew, his white brother, who was alsoadopted, Nathan found himself repeatedly having to explainwhat he saw as a devastating rejection by his birth parents.&quot;I used to say my parents were killed in a plane crash. Ididn't want anyone to think I was given up,&quot; he says. Nathansays his adoptive grandfather always bounced his three whitesiblings on his lap, but left the room when he entered. Heremembers a racist neighbor bellowing epithets at the frontdoor of the Hattons' red-brick townhouse, then threatening tocrucify him or run him over with a car.   Nathan was only a few years old when he began trying tolook white, spending hours in the bathroom plastering downhis hair. He would get down on all fours and drag his head onthe living-room carpet, straining to straighten the kinks. Hecraved acceptance, and tried to ease the tension of beingdifferent by making people laugh, often at his own expense.He was expelled from his nursery school for jumping from cotto cot during nap time and pulling wallpaper off the walls ofthe director's office. At five, Nathan perched naked on thesill of a second-story window at his house, pounding hischest and screaming: &quot;I'm a nigger] I'm a nigger]&quot; At 10, heattempted suicide by swallowing a bottle of aspirin.   &quot;He needed someone to listen,&quot; says his sister Lydia. &quot;Wewere taught that children should repress anger, should beseen but not heard.&quot;   Nathan constantly battled older grade-school boys who madehim the target of racial insults, and broke one tauntingfifth grader's nose. He racked up 16 suspensions in theseventh grade and spent time in several juvenile homes forjoy-riding accidents and car theft. His parents still sleepwith the car keys under their pillow and their valuableslocked behind a bolted bedroom door.   Nathan says his limited experiences with blacks have beenalienating. Black children threw stones at him when hismother took him to her inner-city office. He stormed out of ameeting at a black college fraternity when talk turned towhat Nathan considered racist diatribes against white people.   Jane Collie, the Hattons' only close black friend andNathan's childhood piano teacher, says, &quot;Nathan can't dealwith blacks, but he has to accept himself for what he is.&quot;The young man now says he is proud of his adoptive parents,and grateful that they stuck by him. He adds that he plans toassociate with whites or Asians on campus, with whom he feelsmore at ease. &quot;I don't care what people say so much any more.I'll lose my mind if I worry about it,&quot; he says. &quot;I have tofeel better about myself.&quot;                                                                                                          Samantha Davidge   Samantha Davidge has almost always felt good aboutherself. &quot;There is nothing black parents could have donebetter,&quot; says Samantha, 25. &quot;I never felt I wanted a blackmother.&quot; She says she is able to feel comfortable with bothraces. &quot;Some of my {black friends} feel antsy if there aretoo many whites in a crowd,&quot; she says. And, she is less quickto blame many problems on racism. &quot;A lot of my black friendssee themselves as victims. They are always defensive.Sometimes that's best, but sometimes, it's not.&quot;   Samantha gives lots of credit to her mother, Rosaearl.Herself a foster child, Rosaearl went on to raise 12 fosterchildren plus four of her own in the San Fernando Valleysection of Los Angeles. Samantha says her mother carefullynourished her self-esteem and confidence, and hammered homethat people's prejudices are their own problem.   On a recent day, Rosaearl, a graying woman clad inthreadbare blue jeans, sat amid a clutter of cribs in theirstuccoed Southern California house feeding &quot;little MissCocaine Fits,&quot; one of her foster children who suffered fromdrug or sexual abuse.   Rosaearl Davidge is angry that opposition to transracialadoptions has cut their number to only about 1,000 a year,leaving many of the 14,400 adoptable black children bouncingbetween various institutions or foster homes, which areusually white. Half, by most estimates, will never find apermanent home. Meanwhile, as many as two million familieswant to adopt children, and 8,000 other couples this yearwill choose to go abroad to adopt, taking home mostlychildren from Korea and South America but also black babiesfrom Africa.   Samantha says that at times in her life she sufferedbecause of her lack of familiarity with blacks. White girlsaccepted her until junior high school, when &quot;suddenly it wasnot OK for the white kids I had grown up with to hang outwith me.&quot; Samantha didn't know any black youngsters exceptfor the inner-city children bused to her school; to her, theyseemed loud and intimidating. She was friendly for a timewith two local black girls, but when the three drifted apartthe two girls harangued her in a classroom, loudly sayingthat she considered herself superior because she had a whitemother. &quot;You're nothing but an Oreo,&quot; Samantha recalls themshouting.   But Samantha befriended other black girls and boys, someof whom seemed stunned when her white mother greeted them atthe door. As a University of Southern California graduatestudent in social work, Samantha says she is comfortable withher race. &quot;Society sees me as black,&quot; she says. &quot;There's noway I could do otherwise.&quot;                                                                                                          Sarah Bunker                                                                                                          Four years ago, a pregnant Sarah Bunker bolted upright inbed, drenched with sweat from a nightmare. In the vision, awhite child had emerged from her womb, a child destined tolive the anxious life that has been Sarah's since a whitecouple adopted her.   &quot;There have been so many times she needed someone to whomshe could relate experientially,&quot; says Sarah's mother,Virginia, who adopted Sarah as a toddler before the familyjourneyed to the 1972 St. Louis adoption convention. &quot;I haveknown the pain and frustration of wanting to be a blackparent&quot; for her four adopted black children, she adds.   It's not that the Bunkers haven't made sacrifices. In1977, Sarah's father, Rodney, quit his tenure-track job as aUniversity of Wisconsin political science professor to movefrom mostly white Eau Claire, Wis., to more racially mixedMinneapolis, Minn. He has driven a city bus there for morethan a decade.   Sarah played with black dolls. She took camping trips withthe Open Door Society, a group of families with transraciallyadopted children. A portrait of the Rev. Martin Luther KingJr. hangs above the fireplace of the Bunkers' house. &quot;Momconstantly told us how special it was to be black,&quot; saysSarah, now 21.   For Sarah's brother Joshua, who is also black and adopted,the environment proved richly nurturing. His parents&quot;encouraged me to experience black culture and my heritage,&quot;says Joshua, a recent graduate in East Asian studies fromYale University. &quot;There was no time I wanted to yell at them:Why aren't you black? There was no time I felt a lack oflove. I felt fortunate for the stability of the family andtheir economic means. I could have been raised by otherparents, less educated or less able to support me.&quot;   But Sarah saw it differently. She says she felt like ablack person stuck with a white person's ways, appearance andvalues. Blacks in her Minneapolis junior high school talkeddifferently, were more clothes-conscious and wore their hairin neat cornrows. Sarah wore utilitarian garb and two braidsprotruding from the sides of her head. &quot;When you looked atme,&quot; she says, &quot;you knew I had white parents.&quot; Her blackschoolmates, she says, also seemed tough and moreconfrontational; her parents counseled pacifism. &quot;Why do youwalk like that?&quot; one black classmate demanded. &quot;Why don't youget a little soul?&quot; Sarah screamed back: &quot;I have whiteparents. It isn't my fault]&quot;   She became obsessed that something was wrong with her.When she visited her adoptive grandparents in Rhinelander,Wis., people in restaurants stared with their mouths agape.&quot;I felt like a big bright spotlight was on me all the timebecause I had white parents,&quot; Sarah says. She hated diningout alone with her father for fear others would take her fora prostitute.   In the ninth grade, Sarah suddenly gained 20 pounds, hadcontinual crying jags and saw her grades plummet. &quot;I felt soalone. I felt like an outcast. I wanted to be like otherblacks so badly,&quot; she says. &quot;I felt that if I had blackparents, I would have fit in.&quot;   Sarah says she later found comfort when she rebelledagainst her parents and moved in with her black boyfriend.She has since given birth to two children and says thatcreating her own black family has finally brought her somepeace.   Sarah says one positive aspect of growing up in whitesociety is that she now feels she understands whites betterthan her friends do. She says her friends, who are mostlyblack, view whites as distant authority figures generally outto do them harm. &quot;I can understand both worlds,&quot; she says.&quot;I've been on both sides.&quot;   Still, she seethes when she sees white parents with ablack child. &quot;I know they love the child to death,&quot; she says.&quot;But when I think of the kid I say: What a terrible thing.&quot;                                                                                                          Kurt Reinhardt                                                                                                          On a car trip last Christmas to his adoptive grandmother'shouse, Kurt Reinhardt revealed the deep grudge he holdsagainst white society. He told his brother Eric, who iswhite, that to develop their real potential blacks must liveseparately from whites, and should use violent means ifnecessary to cleave the two societies.   Growing up in a white family hurt his own development,says Kurt, 20. &quot;Self-love was not there. All I came out withwas a collage of confusion.&quot; Since he began attendingpredominantly black Howard University a year ago, he says hewishes he had grown up in the black culture, too.   Such thinking is a radical change for Kurt. For years, hesays, being part of a white family let him feel privilegedand different from other blacks. He used to drag Eric toparties in his hometown of Lexington, Ky., to make the pointthat he was from a white family. Amie Winn, his high-schoolsweetheart, says Kurt told her he was better than herprevious black boyfriends because only one of his birthparents was black. &quot;He thought he was unique, that he didn'tbelong to either category,&quot; says Eric. When he took a collegeentrance test at age 17, he couldn't decide what to indicateas his race, so he left the box blank.   Kurt saw little advantage to viewing himself as blackwhile growing up. In the sixth grade, his principal bluntlytold Kurt, after he had fought a white boy over a younggirl's affections, that the girl's parents didn't want her todate blacks. At the local department store, security guardsshadowed him, assuming he would steal, he says. And policeofficers often stopped him to ask what he was doing in thewhite neighborhood where he lived.   &quot;I enjoyed being the token,&quot; Kurt says. &quot;I played soccerand ate oysters on the half shell. Black people playedbasketball and ate chitterlings.&quot; The illusions held untilhis senior year in high school when he injured a knee andmany of his white friends, mostly soccer players, became moredistant after he was no longer on the team, he says. Kurtbecame miserable. He gained 25 pounds and contemplatedsuicide. As a freshman at the University of Kentucky the nextyear, he felt rejected by both whites and blacks. He sankinto introversion and got a Mohawk haircut.   Now at Howard, Kurt says he feels much more accepted. Heno longer averts his eyes from other blacks. During a stintselling books door-to-door this summer, he purposely nods asthey pass him on the street.                                                                                                          John Raible   John Raible was Milwaukee's first transracially adoptedchild. Now 30, he still sounds bitter when he talks about howhis parents minimized his being black. When he applied for aSocial Security card his mother said he should check the boxindicating he was white. When his high-school counseloradvised applying for a minority scholarship, his parents&quot;said to give it to a more deserving, real black student,&quot;John recalls.   &quot;We didn't want him to feel different from the otherchildren,&quot; says his mother, Patricia, who emphasizes that oneof John's birth parents is white, the other black. &quot;We didview him as essentially white,&quot; she says. &quot;He was raised asour son, just as we raised our other two children.&quot; John, anelementary-school teacher who now lives in a Long Beach,Calif., apartment lined with African masks, counters: &quot;Theydidn't understand how I felt as a person of color.&quot;   Because they considered him white, John's parents playeddown his encounters with racism. When his junior prom washeld at a country club that didn't allow blacks, he says,they offered excuses for why it wasn't important that heattend the affair. They didn't notice his dismay when, in theseventh grade, classmates taunted him, comparing his skin tothe color of excrement. He began sucking in his lips so theywould seem thinner, more Caucasian.   John gave up trying to talk to his parents about raceproblems; he became a loner and his school grades dropped toD's. He was terrified of the few blacks he encountered andtended to stereotype them. When his father, a Unitarianminister, took 10-year-old John to New York and visited theUnited Nations building, 30 black children who came into thegift shop together seemed rude, pushy and intimidating tohim. &quot;All I knew of blacks was what I saw on TV -- allnegative, clownish people like George Jefferson. Orcriminals,&quot; he says. The only other black at his private highschool was the son of a trustee's maid.   &quot;I felt isolated and confused,&quot; John says. &quot;You can'traise kids to just think of themselves as human beings. Youmust acknowledge that they are black, and will be perceivedas black.&quot; He adds, &quot;It's not possible for white parents toteach blacks about identity and racism.&quot; Slowly, he began toseek out black experiences by listening to black radiostations and mingling with other blacks at the local mall.   John says adoption agencies are inflexible and too slow tofind black parents for black babies. He is single but adoptedhis own black son, Kelly, three years ago, and says he nowrealizes how hard raising a child can be. Still, it was onlyafter years of anger, during which he refused to speak to hisparents, that he finally visited them this summer. &quot;Lovingme,&quot; he says simply, &quot;just wasn't enough.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
