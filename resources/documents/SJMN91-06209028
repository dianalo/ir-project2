Shannon's &quot;Right to have children stops at my pocketbook&quot; (Letters, July19) could serve as the constitution for a society in which the value of one'slife is determined solely by economics.;    Shannon's frightening proposal toreduce families on social welfare mirrors China's current &quot;family planning&quot;policies, which tolerate only one child per family and force unwillingsterilization on parents who have filled their quota. Chinese citizens whodefy this law are at risk of imprisonment and even death, all in the name ofpopulation control.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  The Letters Page  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SHALL LIVES BE VALUED SOLELY ON ECONOMICS?  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Letters Page  </MEMO><TEXT>     I agree that we should tighten restrictions on social welfare programswhile encouraging and assisting those who receive aid to find gainfulemployment. But I fear people like Shannon, who would revoke theconstitutional liberties of an entire class of people, even separating mothersfrom their children, in order to lighten their own tax burden.;    There areways of addressing the social welfare problem in our country (most notably byconcentrating on the breakdown of the family) without attacking those who arehonestly struggling to make their American dream a reality and to whomchildren are not a burden but an investment for the future.;    -- BrendanPatrick Murphy; Santa Clara  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910727  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  205  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday July 27, 199100209028,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
