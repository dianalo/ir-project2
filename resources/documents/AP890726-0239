SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sitting at the end of the runway the aircraftseems almost to paw the concrete with impatience, more than 18,000horsepower cranking four big propellers.   Indeed, it seems too much power just to get a dozen or so peopleand some electronic gear aloft. But this is no ordinary plane.   The Lockheed P-3 Orion has scored 37 victories over the mostfearsome storms known to man, flying into the teeth of hurricanesto fathom their secrets.   The hail and rain dousing the outside of the plane on a recentstop in Washington are nothing compared to what this craft has seenin the flights signified by 37 red symbols on its fuselage. Themarks are in the shape that meteorlogists use to record a hurricaneon a weather map.   A victory for the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration research plane is recorded by flying directly intothe storm to record its strength and then returning home safely.   Gilbert, the record-breaking hurricane devastated Jamaica andparts of Mexico last summer, yanked the craft up and down and sideto side, but couldn't prevent it from completing the mission.   ``I was waiting for the one that would pull the wings off,''recalled navigator Tom Gerish. The plane survived a half-dozen hardjerks in various directions when it flew from the eye of Gilbertinto the heavy winds of the eye wall. It survived them all.   The calm eye at the center of Gilbert was only seven milesacross, compared to 30 miles for an average hurricane, Gerish added.   Hurricane Allen, a year earlier, buffeted the plane with thestrongest wind it has faced, a 203-knot blast, which translates toabout 240 miles per hour.   Knowing the plane is strong enough to survive such forcesinspires confidence when facing a summer rainstorm over theChesapeake Bay, riding along to watch an NOAA research plane inaction.   The two NOAA Orions are based in Miami, remaining there in thewarm, hurricane-prone months to be on call when needed, andtraveling to other areas for various sorts of research in otherseasons.   They get lots of riders _ scientists, professors, reporters _early in the summer, Capt. L.J. Genzlinger said. But by the end ofthe year it gets lonely on the 4 a.m. flights looking for storms,he said.   The 37 hurricane badges on the plane include a few with theirstylized cloud track backward. Those, Gerish explained, representvisits to Australia, where hurricane winds careen in the otherdirection.   On this side of the equator hurricane winds whipcounter-clockwise around the center of the storm. South of theequator they churn the other way.   In addition, the markings include a couple dozen flag symbols,representing countries from Denmark to India, Egypt to Japan, wherethe craft has conducted research. The Orion even has been beenpermitted to fly through normally closed Cuban air space.   Regardless of the season ``there's always weather out there'' tobe investigated, said flight engineer James DuGranrut.   The craft has investigated hailstorms in South Dakota,atmospheric chemistry in New Guinea, monsoons in India and Malaysiaand fishery stocks off the coast of Alaska, among other missions.   On its flight over the Chesapeake Bay the plane was equipped forstudying cloud physics. Electronic display screens allowed thescientists to measure and record temperature, wind, water contentof clouds, cloud droplet size, chemical components of the air, andso forth.   New Doppler radar allows the plane to measure the movement ofwind and water inside a cloud from a distance, something DuGranrutappreciates.   ``Before we had that, we had to fly through the cloud. We'd geta pretty rough ride sometimes. Remote sensing instruments aregreat,'' he said.   Hurricanes, thunderstorms and many other clouds still must beattacked directly, though.   On a recent mission to the Midwest the plane had to fly intoclouds to determine their suitability for rainmaking experiments,Gerish explained.   Rainmakers disperse chemicals into clouds in the hope that thechemical molecules will serve as nuclei for water to condense on,forming a cloud and leading to rain.   That will work only if lack of nuclei is the reason it isn'training. If there already is plenty of smoke, salt or dust forwater to condense on, adding more chemicals won't help, Gerishsaid. So, the Orion flew into clouds to sample the potential nucleithere.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday July 30</NOTE></DOC>
