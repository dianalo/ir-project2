The report by former federal judge Marvin E. Frankel marked amajor step in implementing a national class action for thousands oflawsuits filed against companies with insufficient assets to payasbestos claims.   The 24-page document was a stark portrayal of a companystruggling under the weight of asbestos claims, which form thebiggest product liability matter in U.S. history. Eagle-Picher,based in Cincinnati, is a maker of industrial products that usedasbestos widely for years.   Frankel said Eagle-Picher has more than 64,000 asbestos claimspending with another 20,000 being filed annually. The company's1988 forecast of $613 million in asbestos liability was toooptimistic, he said, and it faces a cash shortfall of up to $75million by 1992.   ``There is, in a word, a clear danger for disaster forEagle-Picher within the next two years,'' the report said. ``Thereis a strong prospect of insolvency by the end of 1992.''   Frankel also said there is a ``clear risk'' the company will notbe able to pay future claimants seeking to recover for asbestosinjuries or deaths. Inhaled asbestos fibers can cause lung cancerand other respiratory ailments many years after the fact.   ``At this time Eagle-Picher's options appear limited,'' Frankelsaid. ``Aggressive settlement of claims and aggressive litigationboth require cash flow beyond current expectations.''   Frankel was appointed as a special master in the case last monthby U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein. Frankel said Eagle-Pichermet legal requirements for its claims to be converted into a classaction.   Weinstein has said he plans to pool the resources ofEagle-Picher and up to five other companies that don't have themoney to fight cases in court or pay present and future claims.   Weinstein's effort is part of a three-tiered plan to resolve 20years of contentious litigation and clear state and federal courtsnationwide of some 90,000 asbestos lawsuits.   The judge has said he expects to combine funds from Eagle-Picherand the other companies with money from the Manville trust tosettle claims.   The Manville trust, formed after Manville Corp. reorganized inbankruptcy court, is in the process of being overhauled. A plan forManville Corp. to inject up to $520 million in new money into thetrust was announced Friday.   Frankel said Eagle-Picher has paid out $5,990 per claim tosettle about 64,000 claims to date, sharply higher than 1988estimates. It also doled out $35 million on legal expenses lastyear while generating $27 million less from operations thanprojected.   Eagle-Picher has been forced to sell off businesses to meet itsasbestos claims, but even the recent divestiture of three divisionsfell short by $12.3 million. Also, its remaining insurance forfiscal 1990 and 1991 is just $8 million, $17 million less thananticipated.   ``The result is a picture . . . that is fraught with risks goingto the company's very survival, let alone its ability to meet itsasbestos liabilities,'' Frankel said.   In addition to the fund created by Eagle-Picher and the othercompanies, a second part of the national asbestos plan called for agroup of healthy companies facing claims to form a settlement fundin Cleveland.   But that attempt was struck down by the 6th U.S. Circuit Courtof Appeals in Cincinnati, which said federal Judge Thomas D.Lambros did not have the right to consolidate cases outside hisjurisdiction.   The third phase of the plan _ a class action of cases that wouldgo to trial _ is proceeding before federal Judge Robert M. Parkerin Beaumont, Texas, where a hearing is set for next Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
