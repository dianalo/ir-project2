Col. Oliver North has emerged as an overnight pop hero, but the same public that is so mesmerized by his persona is considerably less receptive to what he is saying about President Reagan.    A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that the public overwhelmingly believes that Col. North testified truthfully before the Iran-Contra investigating committees and shouldn't be criminally prosecuted for his role in the scandal. But despite his words of strong support for Mr. Reagan, a plurality of Americans believe his testimony damaged the president, and strong majorities believe that Mr. Reagan knew and approved of the diversion of funds from the Iran arms deal to the Nicaraguan rebels.    The nationwide survey of 1,200 adults, which was conducted Sunday, did find an increase in approval for the administration's support of the Nicaraguan rebels. At the same time, however, Americans come down against having Congress vote military aid to the rebels. And slightly more Americans said Col. North's testimony affected them negatively than positively on the question of Contra aid.    What that adds up to, say pollsters, sociologists and cultural commentators, is an outpouring of public affection for Ollie North, the man -- and not his message. &quot;It is the triumph of style over substance,&quot; concludes pollster Andrew Kohut, president of the Gallup Organization. Adds Norman Lear, the television producer and liberal activist: &quot;Who doesn't love Huck Finn?&quot;    Willard Gaylin, a psychoanalyst and president of the Hastings Center, a thinktank outside New York City devoted to ethical issues, suggests that there's a &quot;natural aesthetic bias&quot; in the public's reaction. &quot;Whatever Ollie North is, he looks cute, sweet,&quot; Dr. Gaylin says.    According to the Journal/NBC poll, fully two-thirds of the American public had a favorable opinion of Col. North after his first four days of testimony; only one in five Americans had an unfavorable view. Sixty-nine percent think he shouldn't be criminally prosecuted for his role in the scandal.    The survey further showed broad acceptance of Col. North's version of events in the affair. By a margin of 82% to 10%, Americans believe his contention that he acted with the approval of his superiors in diverting Iran arms-sale money to the Contras. And 71% said that, in general, he testified truthfully before the investigating committees -- although 38% also thought he lied during his testimony to protect President Reagan. Forty-six percent said he didn't lie to protect Mr. Reagan.    In any case, Col. North's testimony seemed to do the president little good. Forty-six percent said Mr. Reagan was damaged by the testimony, while 31% said it was helpful. And the poll shows a damned-if-he-knew, damned-if-he-didn't attitude toward Mr. Reagan's involvement. Despite the president's consistent denials, Americans by a margin of 53% to 29% think the president approved the funds diversion; even Republicans are split evenly on the question. By an even more overwhelming margin -- 91% to 5% -- Americans think Mr. Reagan should have known about the diversion.    The president's job approval rating, 46%, is unchanged since last May, though there has been a slight increase in the number of people who give him positive marks in handling the Iran-Contra situation -- to 24% from 18%.    Contra supporters may be heartened by the increase in support for the administration's policy of aiding the Nicaraguan rebels. Forty percent of those questioned now approve of the policy, while 43% oppose it; in May, 32% supported the policy, while 54% opposed it. But it isn't clear whether that increased support will continue once Col. North is no longer on television every day defending the policy; 48% still don't want Congress to vote for military aid, while 38% favor it.    Moreover, there is strong disagreement -- by a margin of 64% to 27% -- with the notion that presidential aides and advisers have the right to lie to Congress to protect secret U.S. operations.    Analysts suggest that it is Col. North's moral certitude and his ability to project many of the nation's most cherished -- and at times contradictory -- hero-images that is the source of his popularity. &quot;He believes in the rightness of everything he's done, whether it was honest or dishonest, whether it was legal or illegal,&quot; explains Burns Roper, a pollster. &quot;I think he captures the imagination of the public as the guy in the white hat, courageous, daring, resourceful, willing to admit a mistake, but very dedicated.&quot;    In Col. North's world, it is clear who are the heroes and who are the villains. His message is the Clint Eastwood approach: everything is justified by the enormity of the opposition -- terrorists, Communists, people without any apparent redeeming qualities. &quot;He taps into this simple view of the world -- the good guys, the bad guys,&quot; says Amitai Etzioni, a sociologist at George Washington University.    Col. North undoubtedly attracted sympathy from those who regarded him as an underdog in his confrontation with the U.S. Congress. One in three Americans in the national poll say the investigating committees have treated him unfairly, while 50% say he has been treated fairly. But at the same time, he didn't portray himself as a rebel or a rule breaker, and has benefited from low expectations about him before the hearings. &quot;People expected the boogeyman from the White House basement,&quot; suggests Gallup's Mr. Kohut. Instead, they got a man who &quot;looks incredibly normal, incredibly American, small-town values and all that.&quot;    Observes Dr. Gaylin of the Hastings Center: &quot;It's a combination of a boyish look and a uniform, which I'm afraid is irresistible to a large number of people.&quot;    Still, many analysts and pollsters believe that Col. North's charisma has clear limits. &quot;He's going to be edited down,&quot; suggests Mr. Etzioni. &quot;This is the first-cut response, before people have a chance to think about what it really means.&quot;    Mr. Kohut agrees. &quot;If you look at what people are saying about the scandal itself, they strongly disapprove of the Iran-Contra connection, of selling arms to the Iranians. The feelings about Nicaraguan involvement are so deep that while there may be some short-term softening of opinion because of sympathy for North, in the end it's not going to stick.&quot;    ---&quot;Do you think North's testimony has been helpful to President Reagan or damaging to the president?
