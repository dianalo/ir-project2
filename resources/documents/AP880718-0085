MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson is trying to get what he wants atthe Democratic National Convention by refusing to say just what itis. That leaves artfully unanswered the riddle that has worried theDemocrats all year.   Jackson described his demands in euphonic generalities that,right up to the convention's opening day, defied any settlementwith Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee inwaiting.   That preserved what little suspense remained in the Democraticscript. More to the Jackson point, it preserved the losingcandidate's role on the convention stage.   Jackson's platform dissent will be played out on Tuesday. Hisname will be entered in his losing cause on the roll call forpresidential nomination on Wednesday night. He said today he wouldnot enter it for the vice presidential nomination on Thursday andwould not encourage anyone else to do so, but it is still possiblesomebody will put his name up against Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas,Dukakis' choice and the certain nominee.   Nonetheless, Jackson says that by the end of convention week,the party will be united.   Dukakis will be in control from tonight's opening gavel. Whendelegates vote on a major issue, they will vote with Dukakis _although his camp can afford to provide conciliatory leeway forvictories by the Jackson minority on some points.   Jackson says he isn't after a job, a title or a position. ``Iseek a partnership, I seek equity, I seek shared responsibility,''he said.   Later, the black candidate tried a plantation analogy. ``I don'tmind working,'' he said. ``I'll go out and pick the voters. I'll goback and bale up some votes. But when I get back to the big house Iwant to help count the cotton.''   Jackson complains that the Democrats have not defined a place``for the progressive wing in the campaign.''   Dukakis could, of course, reply that he is something of aprogressive _ or at least that some of his best friends areprogressives.   Dukakis and his lieutenants have said repeatedly that they wantJackson in the councils of the party and on the campaign for theDemocratic ticket. They've said that Jackson's campaign allies willhave a role. But they are not about to give away pieces of thepolitical command the Massachusetts governor won in the Democraticpresidential primaries.   Dukakis said Sunday that Jackson is an important member of theDemocratic team, but added pointedly that he won't be calling theplays. ``Every team has to have a quarterback,'' the Massachusettsgovernor said. ``That's the nominee.''   Jackson had a sporting reply. ``The Democratic convention isjust the all-star game, not the World Series,'' he told hissupporters. ``Don't make World Series decisions, don't just say howwell you're doing because you make a great shot in the firstquarter.''   Ron Brown, Jackson's convention manager, said a unity accordwould require ``mutual trust and respect and a feeling of comfortwhich can only grow from a face-to-face meeting.'' The two met twoweeks ago in Boston, but that was before Dukakis chose Bentsen ashis vice presidential nominee, and let it be known publicly beforehe told Jackson privately.   Another adviser, Frank Watkins, said the Jackson camp wants tobe ``in the circle, in the loop, on the team.'' Once that's clear,he said, such matters as campaign travel arrangements and staffhelp for the general election will fall into place.   He didn't quite dismiss speculation that one of the thingsJackson wants is access to a chartered campaign airplane. Afterall, said Watkins, if the Dukakis people want Jackson to campaignin California one day and New York the next, they won't expect himto walk.   That general election campaign role is the one that will countfor the Dukakis ticket, and for Jackson as well.   Former President Jimmy Carter said Jackson will work for theticket. In Carter's view, Jackson will not risk being seen as thecause of a Democratic rift that might lead to defeat on Nov. 8.   Along with his demands, Jackson sends regular signals that hewill be aboard for the campaign against the Republicans.   While he told labor delegates on Sunday that the conventionshould not be a coronation, Jackson added:   `We're not threatening to leave the convention. We'rethreatening to stay.''</TEXT></DOC>
