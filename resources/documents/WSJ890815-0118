First came pop-up ads. Then came musical ads. Now, computer disk ads are about to start in consumer magazines.    When the Sept. 4 issue of Forbes appears next week, 210,000 copies of the magazine will include floppy disks bound into ads for Nexis News Plus. When used in a personal computer, the 5 1/4 inch disks offer a demonstration of Nexis, an electronic news retrieval service created by Mead Data Central. Says the print ad's headline: &quot;You Are Now Within 5 1/4 Inches Of Knowing It All.&quot;    Mead Data seized on the disk-in-an-ad idea because Nexis News Plus caters to executives who aren't particularly computer-literate -- and the disk shows that &quot;it's a very easy product to use,&quot; a company spokesman says. Executives who don't often use personal computers are &quot;intimidated,&quot; he adds. &quot;If you don't use them a lot they're a little frightening. This is real dramatic, it's fast, and it puts it right in someone's hands.&quot;    The Nexis disk is the first to appear in a consumer magazine, but it is just the latest twist in marketing everything from insurance to help-wanted ads via computer disks. People who own personal computers -- and there are about 43 million PCs in the U.S. by some estimates -- &quot;are an extremely attractive audience demographically,&quot; says J.G. Sandom, chief executive officer of New York-based Einstein andamp; Sandom Inc., one of a handful of ad agencies specializing in ads on disks. &quot;They're more sophisticated than a boob-tube type audience, they're very affluent, and they have a lot more diposable income to spend.&quot;    The diskette ads cost far more than typical print ads, and the diskettes are easily damaged -- potentially alienating the very people advertisers are trying to impress. But that hasn't swayed a number of companies from experimenting with them. The diskette ads almost always use splashy graphics, plenty of color, and interactive sequences that can make them seem more like video games than hard-core sales pitches.    Most of the disks are mailed to people who already have computers. But while the disks started out as basically junk mail for computer jocks -- serving primarily to show off some new type of software -- they have become, in this computer age, almost mass marketing for regular folks.    General Motors' Buick division, for example, began advertising free diskettes in computer magazines three years ago, and now gives away 175,000 of them a year. The disks, in full color, show off Buick cars and technology, offer a Buick trivia quiz and throw in a spreadsheet to calculate payments on a new Buick car. &quot;It's reaching a target market of home computer users which is very upscale and attractive for us. They're educated, have higher incomes, and they're the right age,&quot; says Nancy Newell, manager of Buick's electronic product information department. Ford Motor also has used disks to advertise its products.    Einstein andamp; Sandom, meanwhile, designed a diskette for Squibb Corp. to send to MBA students at Harvard and other top business schools this past spring. A followup study found that 33% of students viewed the diskette only once, 29% viewed it only twice, and 18% viewed it three times or more. Richard Laroy, Squibb's administrator of college recruitment, says the company is preparing another diskette for next spring's graduating classes.    Einstein andamp; Sandom also is creating an interactive diskette for the Netherlands. It will be offered, free, to senior executives at more than 2,000 companies and offers exhaustive information about the Netherlands, right down to the ins and outs of customs and transportation (illustrated by little airplanes and ships running across the screen). Other companies also have used diskettes for business-to-business advertising, including Citicorp and American International Group.    Computer disk ads are becoming enough of a factor in advertising that a few mainstream ad agencies are getting involved in making them, too. WPP Group's Ogilvy andamp; Mather, for example, created a floppy diskette explaining Equitable's financial planning services, which Equitable insurance agents distributed to their customers. The diskette analyzed the computer user's own financial situation.    But advertising on computer diskettes is costly and often isn't worth it. Mead wouldn't disclose spending for its Forbes ads, but Mr. Sandom says a master diskette can cost $25,000 to $30,000, while duplication costs run 25 cents to $1.25 for each disk; the price of the ad space and of inserting the diskettes would be extra. When disks are part of a direct mail package, each piece of mail comes to $2 to $4, Mr. Sandom says.    What's more, Mead's ambitious Forbes ad could prove technically worrisome, as well. Mr. Sandom says his company tried binding a diskette ad into a computer publication several years back, but a large number of the diskettes were damaged during binding.    The Mead spokesman, however, says the company engineered several test runs at Forbes's Illinois binding plant to make sure the diskettes weren't damaged. He says the diskette will be included in only 210,000 Forbes -- those pegged for top executives, as well as those distributed in New York, Chicago and California -- because including the diskette slows down the binding process 20% to 25%.    Mead also kept security tight to prevent tampering with the diskettes; Mead security experts even escorted the truck carrying the diskettes to the printing plant. The diskettes in the ads are bound in closed envelopes, with a sticker plastered over the opening and warning not to use if it is open. &quot;There's been so much in the news about viruses,&quot; the spokesman says. &quot;This way people will know it's a disk no one has tampered with.&quot;    ---   Mayer Suit Is Dismissed    Oscar Mayer Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., said the federal lawsuit it filed involving the advertising of Bryan Foods Inc., a unit of Sara Lee Corp., was dismissed.    The suit had charged, among other things, that Bryan's advertising of hot dogs, bacon and bologna unfairly represented Bryan's market share in the South compared with Oscar Mayer, and that the advertising had made unfair or misleading comparisons regarding taste tests.    Bryan didn't agree that its advertising was misleading or deceptive. But a spokeswoman for Bryan said that the company started running new advertising July 31.    ---   Ad Notes. . . .
