Nassar Kidwa, the representative ofthe Palestine Liberation Organization, during the Security Councilsession.   ``Have you ever heard of the so-called plastic bullet thatsettles inside the head, causing total brain damage or brain death,mostly among children?   ``Have you ever heard of troops, even when not in so-calleddanger, being given license to fire at unarmed civilians?''   Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein replied: ``Israel is confrontinglarge-scale rioting and wide-scale violence.   ``Gangs of youths who hurl heavy rocks and iron bars at Israeliswith very clear intent to kill are not demonstators,'' he said.   He said Palestinians have thrown gasoline bombs at cars andschool buses ``burning alive women with babies, innocent familiestaking vacations, pupils on their way to school.''   Speakers from Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, and Senegal called onIsrael to obey the Fourth Geneva Convention protecting civiliansduring conflict.   The U.N. session was adjourned until Monday with no vote on aresolution.   The PLO has tried since mid-January to draft a resolutioncondemning the Israeli army, but it has been unable to formulatelanguage that the United States will not veto.   At least 380 Palestinians have been killed in protests since theuprising began in Dec. 1987, and 15 Jews have died in clashes. Theactivists are trying to chase the Israelis out of the territoriesseized from Arab neighbors in the 1967 Middle East War.   The PLO and Arab League renewed their efforts this week after theU.S. State Department criticized the Israeli army in a human rightsreport. The report said the army's tactics caused ``many avoidabledeaths and injuries.''   The State Department, normally a staunch backer of Israel'spolicies, said Israeli soldiers ``frequently used gunfire insituations that did not present mortal danger to troops, causingmany avoidable deaths and injuries.''   The State Department also condemned the demolition of at least108 houses and sealing of 46 homes in 1988.   The occupants were accused of security violations, but the houseswere demolished before trial or conviction.</TEXT></DOC>
