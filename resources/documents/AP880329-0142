(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Soviet doctors participating in aninternational teleconference said Tuesday they routinely concealthe truth from patients diagnosed as having cancer and theyquestioned the American practice of fully informing patients of atumorous condition.   ``It's hardly a good idea to tell a patient directly that he hasa cancer,'' said Dr. Nikolai Napalkov, president of the U.S.S.R.Oncological Society and a leading cancer researcher in the SovietUnion. ``Only in rare cases, when the patient refuses treatment,does the doctor have the obligation to tell the patient.''   American doctors taking part in the conference stronglydisagreed.   ``The sense of trust that exists between a dcotor and patient isvery important,'' said Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, chief of surgery atthe National Cancer Institute. ``It's impossible for me to imaginegiving quality care without telling the patient the full story.''   The exchange came during a two-hour conference which used asatellite to link researchers at the National Institutes of Healthnear Washington with Soviet experts at a studio in Moscow.   The conference, called ``The Cancer Summit,'' includedpre-recorded comments from President and Mrs. Reagan, both of whomhave been treated for cancer, and the reading of a statement bySoviet General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Mrs. Reagan, who has undergone surgery for breast cancer, saidthat ``cancer is bigger than any one country; it is a problem ofall mankind.''   The first lady said that she had ``always thought cancer wouldstrike someone else, another family.'' But, she said, both she andher husband developed cancers that were surgically removed.   ``We have been fortunate recipients of advanced medicalscience,'' she said.   Reagan, who has been treated for colon cancer, struck the sametheme in his brief remarks.   The president told doctors of the two nations, ``we aredepending on all of you in your combined wisdom to win the battleover this disease and, in doing so, to improve the length andquality of human life for all mankind.''   Gorbachev, in a statement read during the telecast, said canceris an enemy that is striking humans in countries everywhere.   Though there has been progress, Gorbachev said, ``the enemy isfar from routed, he is not retreating and is threatening everybody,and the fight calls for vigorous and concerted action.''   Much of the two-hour teleconference featured films and slidesillustrating cancer research and treatment under way in the twocountries, with Rosenberg presenting the only report of newscientific findings.   Rosenberg said that a new treatment under study uses what hecalls tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. These are naturalcancer-fighting cells that are extracted from the patient's tumorand then purified, concentrated and reinjected into the patient.The lymphocytes then attack the tumor.   The technique is ``in the infancy of development'' and still farfrom ready for general clinical use, said Rosenberg, but hereported that eight out of nine patients who have received thetreatment have been helped.   Napalkov brought up the question of how much to tell cancerpatients about their condition. He introduced an informal filmedperson-on-the-street poll in which most Soviet citizens asked saidthey would prefer not to be told if they have been diagnosed as illwith cancer.   Napalkov said Soviet doctors believe it best to keep secret acancer diagnosis in order to ``preserve the peace of mind'' of thepatient. He said most people regard a cancer diagnosis as a deathsentence and it could ``interfere with internal processes'' if thepatient is fully informed.   Natalia I. Perevodchikova, head of the chemotherapy departmentat the All-Union Oncology Center of the U.S.S.R. Academy of MedicalSciences, agreed with Napalkov and said that Soviet doctors feltsecrecy of diagnosis was the best policy for the patient.   ``Unless there is an acute necessity, such as a refusal oftreatment, there is no need to tell the patient,'' she said.   Asked bluntly why American doctors insist on being open withpatients, both Rosenberg and Dr. Vincent T. Devita Jr., director ofthe National Cancer Institute, said it was a matter of maintainingtrust between physician and patient.   The teleconference was to be broadcast to about 1,500 U.S.hospitals and health care facilities on the Hospital SatelliteNetwork. The U.S. Information Agency also arranged to carry theconference on its WORLDNET system to 57 cities in Europe, Africaand the Middle East. In the Soviet Union, an edited version of theconference will be broadcast to an estimated 150 million people.</TEXT></DOC>
