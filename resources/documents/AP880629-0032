The Senate on Tuesday passed two bills that the tobacco industryhad fought for more than a year. The bills, approved May 30 by theHouse of Commons, were signed Tuesday by Governor General JeanneSauve.   One bill calls for smoke-free workplaces in companies regulatedby the federal government. That includes banks, telecommunicationsfirms and Crown corporations.   The measure also guarantees smoke-free traveling on planes,ships, trains and buses that offer passenger service and arefederally regulated.   The second bill, bans tobacco ads on television, radio,newspapers, billboards and magazines.   The tobacco industry said the prohibition on ads amounted to aninfringement on the right of freedom of speech. The ad ban takeseffect next Jan. 1, but some signs will be permitted until 1993.   Imported broadcasts and publications may still carry tobaccoads. About two-thirds of the periodicals distributed in Canada comefrom the United States.   Another section of the bill outlaws free samples of tobacco. Alltobacco products will have to carry a health warning approved bythe federal government.   Companies violating the strict provisions may be fined up to$300,000.   Tobacco is a $4.8 billion industry in Canada and employs 60,000people. One quarter of the Canadian population smokes.
