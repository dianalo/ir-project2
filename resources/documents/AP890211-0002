Baker III set outtoday on a week-long trip to the capitals of the 14 U.S. allies inWestern Europe likely to be dominated by defense and trade issues.   For Baker, whose foreign policy experience is slight, the tripbeginning in Iceland and winding up next Friday in France is alearning experience and a warmup for a probable NATO summit meetingin the spring.   ``It is a listening trip and it is a consulting trip,'' Bakersaid Friday at a news conference here. ``But I am carrying amessage. We want to make it clear the way to approach the East-Westrelationship is with prudence and with realism. We want you to knowwe are not dragging our feet, seeking delay for the sake of delay.''   Baker said he would solicit the views of the allied governmentson how to negotiate strategic nuclear weapons reductions with theSoviet Union and what to do about modernizing NATO 's battlefieldweapons.   Baker hopes, meanwhile, he has put to rest a potentially ticklishproblem over his holdings in Chemical New York Corp. by saying hewould ``tend to be guided'' by whatever conclusions are reached bygovernment ethics lawyers.   The holding company has $4.5 billion in loans to Third Worldnations, and Baker as secretary of state will be called on to play aleading role in addressing the economic problems of developingcountries.   Baker said he would ask for a presidential waiver allowing him toparticipate in such decisions. But Baker said he would also considerother options, such as selling his stock or changing the terms ofthe blind trust in which all his holdings have been placed in orderto avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest.   ``I have concluded I should seek a waiver because that gives meadditional protection and helps avoid any appearance ofimpropriety,'' Baker said in Ottawa, where he stopped with PresidentBush for five hours of talks with Canadian leaders.   Baker said C. Boyden Gray, Bush's top adviser on ethics, andother government lawyers were trying to find ``a mechanism oractions that would be taken in my case to insulate me from chargesor appearances of a conflict of interest.''   Baker said he had not talked to Gray, and that the President'sethics adviser had not asked him to sell the bank stock. But Bakersaid Gray had raised selling as an option in talking to RobertKimmit, a Washington lawyer who was named Under Secretary of Statefor Political Affairs.   ``I have been very careful about recusing myself from specificissues that might constitute a conflict of an appearance ofconflict,'' Baker said, referring to his jobs as White House chiefof staff and then Treasury Secretary in the Reagan administration.   However, he said government attorneys also told him he couldparticipate in ``general policy determinations'' without violatingethical standards.   Bush and Baker are in the midst of a review of U.S. foreignpolicy. Negotiations with the Soviets to reduce long-range missilesare on hold, and the administration also faces a decision on whetherto ease restrictions on technology sales to the Soviets.   At the same time, Baker will try on the trip to promote increaseddefense spending by the allies even while the Bush administrationtries to keep its own outlays in check.   Baker, who began his NATO discussions Friday night with ForeignMinister Joe Clark of Canada, is also under pressure from the alliesto ease restrictions on trade with the Soviets.   Automatic curbs on technology that could have a military use wereimposed by the Carter administration to punish the Soviets for the1979 invasion of Afghanistan. The Soviet troops are leaving, withthe last soldier due out by next Wednesday.   Baker said he had not made up his mind, despite reports that hehad decided to lift the automatic curbs. But he stressed that if thecurbs are eased ``this does not mean we are opening the doors totechnology transfers.''</TEXT></DOC>
