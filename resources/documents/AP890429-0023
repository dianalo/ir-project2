A grand jury, meanwhile, indicted a sixth teen-ager in thejogger's attack, and city officials announced a beefing up ofsecurity in the area near the attack.   ``This crime was an outrage which shocked every New Yorker,''said Parks Commissioner Henry Stern at a Central Park newsconference.   The new protection plan will include mounted police patrols,increased police car surveillance and the use of police decoys,officials said.   ``Every once in a while something happens that is so shockingand terrible that it brings about a tremendous counterattack,''said Stern. ``I think that's what happened here.''   On Friday afternoon, a grand jury indicted 14-year-old KevinRichardson, the only suspect who admitted raping the woman in hisstatement to police. Six teen-agers are now charged as members ofthe wolf pack who brutalized the woman during a night of``wilding.''   Richardson was charged with rape, attempted murder, assault,sodomy, robbery and riot. He was held without bail pending a May 10hearing.   While Stern detailed the security changes, a confrontationerupted at state Supreme Court between spectators and courtofficers Friday morning when acting Justice Carol Berkman ordereddefense attorney Alton H. Maddox Jr. removed from court.   Maddox had repeatedly refused to follow the judge's instructionsto sit down and remain silent during the hearing.   As spectators stood and screamed at the officers to leave Maddoxalone, Berkman left the bench, and court officers entered thecourtroom with billy clubs and riot helmets. When the judgereturned five minutes later, Maddox and co-counsel Joseph Mackturned and walked out.   They returned 45 minutes later and the judge denied bail fortheir client, 17-year-old Michael Briscoe, after an exchange withMack over his conduct. Briscoe is one of two teens being held foran attack on a male jogger that same night.   Earlier, Berkman refused to set bail immediately for three otherdefendants _ Kharey Wise, 16; Antron McCray, 15; and Steve Lopez,15 _ and told their attorneys to submit their bail applications inwriting.   Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer, arguing againstbail, called the April 19 assault on the Wall Street investmentbanker ``the most vicious and brutal crime in New York to date.''   ``As a result of their rampage, a 28-year-old woman is lyingunconscious in Metropolitan Hospital,'' said Lederer. ``She wasraped, sodomized and brutally beaten, and then left bleeding forhours in the thickest woods.''   The victim, a native of suburban Pittsburgh, remained comatoseand on life-support systems Friday.   In an effort to defuse any racial tensions caused by the attack,Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins met Friday with about 60community and religious leaders and said they would hold a``massive assembly and march'' in the neighborhood where the rapetook place. It was tentatively set for May 7.</TEXT></DOC>
