DPR-53 and DPR-69,issued to the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, (the licensee), for operationof the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, respectively,which are located in Calvert County, Maryland. The proposed amendments,submitted via the license application dated June 9, 1988, as supplementedon October 25 and November 17, 1988 would change the Units 1 and 2 TechnicalSpecifications (TS) 5.6.1, ``Criticality-Spent Fuel,'' and 5.6.2, ``Criticality-NewFuel,'' to increase the maximum U-235 fuel enrichment limit from 4.1 to5.0 weight percent and also, reduce the TS 5.6.2 maximum limit on the effectivemultiplication factor (K<T2>eff</T2>) from 0.98 to 0.95. Additional information concerning expectedcore burnup levels was provided in a December 28, 1988 letter.This assessment shall also apply to any changes proposed in the reactorcore U-235 enrichment limit, up to and including 5.0 weight percent, andto proposed increases in the average level of irradiation of fuel dischargedfrom the reactors up to a batch average discharge burnup limit of 60,000MWD/MT.<ITAG tagnum="84">Need for Environmental Impact Statement</ITAG>The Commission has found that the proposed amendments constitute no additionalsignificant environmental impact and as has, therefore, determined notto prepare an environmental impact statement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment</ITAG>Identification of Proposed AmendmentsCurrently, the maximum permitted enrichment limit for (1) stored new andspent fuel and (2) fuel in the reactor core at Calvert Cliffs Units 1 and2 is 4.1 weight percent U-235. The licensee is in the process of shiftingits core design to incorporate higher enrichment fuel assemblies to supportfull 24-month operating cycles. The first Unit 1 24-month cycle commencedin Spring 1988, with a reload planned for April 1990, while the first Unit2 24-month cycle is nearing its March 1989 completion date. These first24-month cycle cores were transitional designs provided to economicallyutilize the lower enrichment fuel (4.0 to 4.85 weight percent U-235) locatedonsite that had already experience irradiation and burnup during the previous18-month cycles at each unit. Subsequent to the use of this lower enrichmentfuel, the licensee intends to utilize cores with up to 5.0 weight percentU-235 enrichment levels to better support 24 months of continuous poweroperation without refueling. Consequently, the licensee has proposed changesto increase the U-235 enrichment limits in TS 5.6.1, ``Criticality-SpentFuel,'' and TS 5.6.2, ``Criticality-New Fuel,'' from 4.1 to 5.0 weightpercent.In addition, the licensee has proposed to restrict the maximum value ofK<T2>eff</T2> to a limit of 0.95, vice the current limit of 0.98, and addthe full flood condition to the various densities of unborated water conditionsthat are assumed in determining K<T2>eff</T2>. The reduction of the maximum limit for K<T2>eff</T2> for fully flooded conditions was proposed solely to placethe Calvert Cliffs TS limits on new fuel criticality in full accord withthe NRC guidance provided in Section 9.1.1., ``New Fuel Storage,'' of theStandard Review Plan (NUREG-0800). This restrictive change would providemore conservative criticality determinations for new fuel storage thanthose currently required by TS.Need for the Proposed AmendmentsThe proposed changes are needed to allow the licensee to support future24-month full power operating cycles.Environmental Impact of the Proposed AmendmentsThe Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revisions tothe TS and the proposed increase in the burnup limits for the fuel. Thestaff has concluded that such changes would not adversely affect plantsafety. The proposed changes have no significant adverse effects upon theprobability of any analyzed accident. The increased burnup may alter slightlythe mix of fission products that could be released in the event of a seriousaccident but such small changes would not significantly affect the consequencesof said serious accidents. In addition, no changes would result in thetypes or amounts of any radiological effluents that may be released offsite.Finally, these changes would not contribute to any significant increasein individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure.Regarding the potential non-radiological impact of reactor operation withhigher enrichment fuel and increased levels of irradiation, the proposedchanges involve systems located within the restricted area, as definedin 10 CFR Part 20. They do not affect non-radiological plant effluentsand have no other non-radiological environmental impact.The potential environmental impact resulting from the transportation ofhigher fuel enrichment and burnup levels is discussed in the staff assessmententitled, ``NRC Assessment of the Environmental Effects of Extended FuelEnrichment and Irradiation,'' which was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 11, 1988 (53 FR 30355) in connectionwith the Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, Environmental Assessmentand Finding of No Significant Impact. As indicated therein, the environmentalcost contribution of the transportation, due to the increases in the fuelenrichment up to 5% and irradiation limits up to 60,000 MWD/MT are eitherunchanged or may, in fact, be reduced from those summarized in Table S-4as set forth in 10 CFR 51.52(c). These findings are applicable to theseamendments for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and2.Therefore, the Commission concludes that the proposed amendments pose nosignificant radiological or non-radiological environmental impact.Alternatives to the Proposed AmendmentsSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed changes, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested fuel enrichmentand burnup increases. This would not reduce environmental impact of plantoperation and would result in reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the ``Final Environmental Statement Related to the Operation of CalvertCliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Units 1 and 2,'' dated April 1973.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult withother agencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed amendments will not have a significant effect on the quality ofthe human environment.For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the applicationfor license amendments dated June 9, 1988, as supplemented on October 25and November 17, 1988, and (2) the licensee's letter of December 28, 1988,which are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public DocumentRoom, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC and at the Calvert County Library,Prince Frederick, Maryland.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 25th day of January 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Joseph D.
