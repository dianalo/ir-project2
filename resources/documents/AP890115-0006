At least one person was badly injured and several others beatenby hundreds of police who tried to break up the rally by up to 1,000people. Western reporters also saw plainclothes and riot police makeat least a dozen arrests.   The rally was held in defiance of an official ban.   Police had guarded Wenceslas Square in the capital since earlySaturday in an attempt to prevent the independent rally for Palach,who set himself on fire in the square on Jan. 16, 1969, to protestSoviet troops in his country.   Soviet-led Warsaw pact troops invaded Czechoslovakia in August1968 to crush the communist-led reforms known as the ``PragueSpring.''   Sunday's violence occurred after a crowd of 800 to 1,000 peoplemoved toward the center of the square. They shouted ``Freedom,freedom'' and sang the Czechoslovak national anthem.   Police carrying batons immediately moved in from side streets andstarted pushing the crowd back, beating several people. Police wereseen beating two people trying to help an old woman who fell.   At the edge of the square, meanwhile, police kept back hundredsof others behind metal barricades.   About 10 minutes later, three police water cannons startedspraying that crowd, pushing people down side streets.   Other police with dogs and batons moved in, clearing the top ofthe square near the statue of King Wenceslas within about 20 minutes.   Communist authorities banned the rally, but the Charter 77 humanrights movement and four other independent groups who called it saidthey would go ahead anyway. Similar banned rallies in August andOctober drew thousands of people, who also were dispersed by riotpolice.</TEXT></DOC>
