(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A circuit judge has ruled that the city'syear-old loitering ordinance, aimed at street drug dealers, isunconstitutional.   The law is vague and overbroad, and violates the Fourth and 14thAmendments of the U.S. Constitution, Brevard Circuit Judge JohnAntoon decided this week. The Fourth Amendment gives citizensrights against unreasonable search and seizure and the 14thAmendment guarantees the right to due process for any U.S. citizen.   The ordinance, adopted in December 1988, made it unlawful toloiter in or near Melbourne's streets or public places in a mannerfor engaging in drug-related activities.   Melbourne city officials stand by the law, which was closelymodeled after a long-standing ordinance adopted in Tacoma, Wash.,that had withstood scrutiny.   ``We wouldn't have adopted the ordinance if we had not felt itwould meet that test,'' City Manager Samuel Halter said Thursday.   City Attorney Jim Reinman plans to meet with Brevard-SeminoleState Attorney Norm Wolfinger within the next week to discuss anappeal, Halter said.   Only one person had been charged under the ordinance, and thecase against him was dropped when the officer who arrested the manleft the Police Department and failed to appear in court, Haltersaid.   Antoon wrote in his order: ``While the city has passed thislegislation with the noble goal of reducing drug-related crime, ithas also given law enforcement and the state `carte blanche'authority to prosecute innocent people exercising fundamental,personal liberties.''</TEXT></DOC>
