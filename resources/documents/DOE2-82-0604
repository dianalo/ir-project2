With these receivers, concentrated solar energy that is absorbedon the concave surface of a dome is removed by the evaporation of liquidsodium on the convex side of the dome. Vaporized sodium then condenseson an engine's heater tubes and transfers energy to the working fluidof the engine. The condensed sodium returns to the absorber surface whereit is redistributed across the dome by the capillary action of a wick.Issues concerning the flow of sodium in a heat pipe solar receiver areinvestigated in this paper. A comparison is made between various wickoptions, and general issues concerning the design of heat pipe receiversare also discussed. 25 refs., 7 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
