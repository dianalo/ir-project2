Jay Rockefeller was struck by the realization that hisfate would largely be in the hands of strangers.   &quot;I would only know a few of the top 20 or 25 people whowould be critical in the campaign,&quot; he recalled later. Seeingthis as illustrative of his inexperience in nationalpolitics, he chose not to run.</LP><TEXT>   At the same time, Sen. Bob Kerrey, a man with even lesspolitical experience, decided to make the race. What hediscovered in six frustration-filled months was that runningfor president is like making the leap between minor-leaguebaseball and the Big Leagues: What seems easy and routinesuddenly becomes much more complex as the standards andscrutiny escalate tremendously.   Over the past two decades, some formidable figures havestruck out in the major leagues of presidential politics: BobDole, Ted Kennedy, Scoop Jackson, Howard Baker, JohnConnally. Bob Kerrey, a man of unusual character and promise,may be one of the few to come out of it whole, even to fightanother day, providing he understands the lessons of theexperience.   Foremost is that the 48-year-old Nebraska Democrat lackeda coherent and sustainable message about why he wanted to bepresident and where he wanted to lead the country. This wascrystallized by the trade issue -- particularly the infamousKerrey television commercial in New Hampshire, in which thesenator stood in front of a hockey net to warn Japan that, aspresident, he would keep its products out if it continued todiscriminate against American goods.   One of the early myths of this campaign season is that thead backfired because free-trade New Hampshirites rejected themessage. Actually, Bob Kerrey did pretty well in the dailytracking polls when that commercial aired.   The problem was much more basic: The message didn't fitBob Kerrey, who basically is a Midwestern free trader. Inthis context, the senator was absolutely correct when helater called the ad a mistake. A presidential campaign isn'ta propitious time to reinvent one's positions.   Another overriding lesson of the Kerrey campaign concernsVietnam.   Bob Kerrey may well be the most courageous man in morethan half a century to run for president: He won the Medal ofHonor when, as a young Navy lieutenant in Vietnam in 1969, herisked his life -- and lost part of his leg -- to save hismen. He's the first Medal of Honor winner to serve in theSenate in this century.   When the controversy over opponent Bill Clinton'savoidance of the draft erupted, Sen. Kerrey was genuinelyangered, not because of what the young Mr. Clinton did --many of Bob Kerrey's friends found a way to avoid Vietnam too-- but because he believed Mr. Clinton wasn't telling thetruth about what he did. When the Arkansas Democratdisingenuously claimed he put himself in harm's way byentering the draft lottery in 1969, it enraged Mr. Kerrey, aman who knows a lot about putting yourself in harm's way.   But Mr. Kerrey's own war record was, if anything, anegative in the campaign. Part of it is that some votersdon't remember Vietnam, and others want to expunge whatevermemories they do have. And sadly, even though Sen. Kerreybelieves the war was tragically flawed and misdirected, thereremains in some quarters a residual resentment against anyoneassociated with that effort.   That resentment was clearly evident in the media. Areporter once asked him whether, after all he had done inVietnam, he really was qualified to be president. (Does thatmean that Bill Clinton and Dan Quayle, by ducking Vietnam,are more qualified?)   Another lesson from the Kerrey campaign is simply that Mr.Kerrey wasn't very good at the things he had to do to be agood candidate. Not only did he lack a clear message, he alsowas lousy at the shorthand delivery and mini-demagoguery thatare essential in the sound-bite age.   A week before the New Hampshire primary, the Kerreycampaign mounted an event at Hesser Junior College inManchester that was a media manipulator's dream. There was alarge, enthusiastic crowd, bunting, music and a rousingintroduction by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan that invokedmemories of another young war hero, John F. Kennedy. Mr.Kerrey then proceeded to give an existentialist speech; theenthusiasm visibly waned with each passing moment.   Erratic as he was, the untested national candidate showedsigns of finding his voice near the end. Blending his callsfor a generational change with a &quot;can-do&quot; spirit ofgovernance and broadening his health care message, Mr. Kerreyat times seemed on the verge of achieving his potential. Manyobservers thought he was the class of the field in both thefinal New Hampshire debate and the South Dakota encounter.   Even in defeat Sen. Kerrey kept his senses of perspectiveand humor. After his rival Tom Harkin won the Iowa caucuses,Mr. Kerrey was asked why he kept discounting the Harkinvictory. &quot;Self-serving,&quot; he replied.   Mr. Kerrey is a politician of enormous resilience; a storyhe frequently tells about his post-Vietnam recovery isapplicable today. Shortly after his lower right leg wasamputated at the Philadelphia Naval Hospital in 1969, heasked his mother to look and see how much was left. &quot;`Son,there's a lot left,'&quot; he recalls her telling him. &quot;She wasn'ttalking about my body. She was talking about my heart andspirit.&quot;   Life, for sure, is a lot more important than politics. Butpolitically, Mr. Kerrey has a lot left too.   ---   Mr. Hunt is chief of the Journal's Washington bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
