Separate trials for Oliver L. North and three co-defendantswould be ``a massive waste of time and effort,'' IndependentCounsel Lawrence E. Walsh said Tuesday in a legal brief.   Last week, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said a singletrial on the crucial conspiracy charge may be a ``practicalimpossibility,'' but he did not rule on the issue.   The prosecutor said that the defense strategy would require fiveseparate trials on various counts for North, a former NationalSecurity Council staffer; and one each for John M. Poindexter,President Reagan's former national security adviser; businessmanRichard V. Secord; and his former partner, Albert Hakim.   Walsh said the defendants participated in a ``common scheme'' to``create, protect, and preserve an illegal financial and logisticalnetwork ... to support the (Nicaraguan) Contras and otheractivities'' designed by North and Poindexter.   North's lawyers contended that multiple trials were needed fortheir client on counts that charged him but not other defendants.Walsh said the law did not require such a separation.   Gesell said last week a single trial would have problems becauseco-defendants might be unable to exercise their rights to fullyconfront each other in cross-examination.   In this case, such cross-examination might involve questionsthat refer to testimony given to the congressional Iran-Contrainvestigating committees under a grant of limited immunity fromprosecution. The immunized testimony _ given by all defendantsexcept Secord _ cannot be used by the prosecution, and there's achance that Gesell may bar the defense from using it also.   That would create a conflict between the Fifth Amendmentprivilege of a testifying defendant not to have his immunizedtestimony used against him and the right of a defendant under theSixth Amendment to confront his co-defendants in a trial.   In the Iran-Contra case, Secord has asked for the right toquestion North about his immunized testimony on grounds thatNorth's statements to Congress would prove Secord's innocence.   Walsh replied there would be no need for a reference to thecongressional testimony, because the defendants _ testifying underoath in both cases _ would provide the same information.   ``Moreover, even if a defendant initially were to makestatements at trial inconsistent with his prior testimony, hismemory could be refreshed without the need for the introduction ofthat testimony,'' Walsh said.   ``Material used to refresh a witness' recollection need not beadmissible itself,'' he said.   If a conflict developed between the congressional and trialtestimony, the court ``has the ability ... to decide whether topermit a line of questioning drawing on immunized testimony,''Walsh said.   The court also has the option of severing certain charges fromthe case to keep immunized testimony out, Walsh said.   Gesell said at a hearing May 26, ``As I see it, it is apractical impossibility to try the conspiracy counts in thecontext'' of rules on immunity. ``If you try them (the defendants)together, you violate the immunities.''   But the judge added that trying the defendants separately``makes a conspiracy trial a farce. None gets the benefit of theother's testimony.''   He commented at one point, ``Four individual trials isridiculous.''</TEXT></DOC>
