Three years ago, the Justice Department persuaded Judge Greene to break up the U.S. phone system. Yesterday, the department essentially asked him to put it back together again.    &quot;I heard the Department of Justice argue almost daily that the court should listen to the interests of consumers,&quot; Judge Greene lectured a Justice Department lawyer. Alluding to the Federal Communications Commission, he continued: &quot;Now you say someone else should consider that. Was that a different Justice Department talking?&quot;    Judge Greene yesterday began three days of oral arguments on a Justice Department proposal to lift restrictions blocking the regional Bell companies from competing in long-distance, manufacturing and information services. The department had insisted that those restrictions be part of the consent decree that dismantled American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. in 1984, and now it largely insists that they be removed.    Judge Greene showed displeasure with the department's about-face. And that may spell trouble for the regional telephone companies, which claim they are shackled by the restrictions and must expand into new markets to prosper. &quot;The court won't be swayed by political or economic power or by public relations campaigns,&quot; Judge Greene warned.    Yesterday, lawyers representing the department, ATandamp;T, the regional companies and various competitors and consumer groups argued whether the regional companies should be permitted to offer long-distance service. Today, they will take up manufacturing, and tomorrow, information services. Judge Greene is expected to rule on the proposals in the fall.    By all accounts, the Justice Department's weakest case involves long-distance service. In February, it reversed its long-held position and argued that the regional phone companies could offer long distance, provided that the states end monopoly telephone franchises. Then in April, the department changed its mind again, and said regional companies should be banned from long distance unless Judge Greene approves specific waivers allowing them into the business.    Judge Greene appeared skeptical at the latest proposal. &quot;I'm now supposed to consider in each state and locality whether the laws are such to allow entry (into long distance)?&quot; he asked. He also noted criticism in Congress and the telephone industry that he already is over-regulating telecommunications.    Nancy Garrison, a Justice Department lawyer, told Judge Greene that the department didn't believe the regional phone companies should be allowed to offer international long-distance service. To some observers, that appeared to doom a Nynex Corp. bid to buy a stake in a proposed fiber-optic cable between New York and London. But a Nynex spokesman said the cable would carry only business transmissions, and so wouldn't qualify as long distance.    ATandamp;T, which has changed its position from fiercely fighting divestiture to staunchly supporting restrictions for its offspring, had an easier time than the Justice Department did yesterday. Judge Greene rarely interrupted ATandamp;T's lawyer, Howard Trienens, who adopted the tone of a jilted spouse fighting for continuing alimony checks. Changing the decree &quot;will cause to reemerge the very controversies we thought we were getting rid of when we signed the decree,&quot; he said.    Chester Kamin, an attorney for MCI Communications Corp., which opposes lifting the restrictions, made perhaps the day's most spirited argument. &quot;It's a travesty that the department would urge your honor to abandon the decree,&quot; he said. &quot;It's the Chinese water torture method -- they'll drop these waivers on your head drip by drip.&quot;    &quot;You've convinced me,&quot; Judge Greene responded, and a roar of laughter rose from the audience, which was filled with telecommunications lobbyists. </TEXT></DOC>
