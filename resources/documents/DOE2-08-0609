In this approach, instead of working with a latticeof definite (if possible) large size, a sequence of lattices is consideredstarting from the smallest ones. It is shown, by exploiting the variationalaspects of the method of moments, that, through lattices of small size,one can obtain very good approximations for a system with a large correlationlength. Furthermore the continuum limit of these approximations is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
