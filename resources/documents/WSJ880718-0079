On a narrow vote, the union's general executive board named William J. McCarthy, an international vice president of the union for New England, to fill out the remaining three years of the term of Jackie Presser, who died July 9 after a long bout with cancer and heart trouble.    Board members voted for the gruff Mr. McCarthy, who is 69 years old and a lifetime unionist, apparently for a mixture of reasons. But the choice appeared in large measure to be a repudiation of policies adopted by Mr. Presser, many of which seemingly were endorsed by Weldon Mathis, the Teamsters secretary-treasurer, who had been serving as acting president during Mr. Presser's illness.    Mr. Mathis, whom Mr. Presser had picked as his successor, was thought to have the selection locked up until shortly before the vote. But the board voted for Mr. McCarthy on what was reported to be a 9-8 vote, reflecting considerable displeasure with the Presser-Mathis regime.    In its recent lawsuit seeking to oust the union's board and officers, the Justice Department named Mr. McCarthy, along with the rest of the union's board, as having done nothing to fight &quot;rampant corruption&quot; in the union. Some department officials and Teamster officials believe that he may be a ripe target for the government action under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, which is the department's legal basis for its suit alleging union ties to organized crime.    The selection of Mr. McCarthy &quot;doesn't bode well for the union. I'm sure the Justice Department lawyers are having champagne over this. They're probably saying to themselves, 'Watch us get (the Teamsters),'&quot; said one Teamsters official who had backed Mr. Mathis.    Teamsters sources said Arnold Weinmeister, a union vice president from Seattle, tried to head off the McCarthy election by calling for a special convention at which union delegates would vote on Mr. Presser's successor. According to these sources, Mr. Weinmeister suggested that if Mr. McCarthy were picked, the government's RICO hand would be strengthened and that federal trustees might be named to run the union.    According to an article in the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Joseph Trerotola, a Teamsters vice president in New York, took personal credit for Mr. McCarthy's election. Mr. Trerotola was identified as being under the influence of organized crime in a May 1988 report by the New York State Organized Crime Task Force.    Mr. McCarthy told a news conference at the Teamsters headquarters in Washington that the department's suit was full of &quot;insinuations.&quot; But he said the federal judge handling the case is &quot;an older man with tons of experience; tough . . . but fair and honest.&quot;    Mr. McCarthy, known informally as &quot;Billy McCarty&quot; among Teamsters officials, quickly demonstrated what may well be the tone of his regime. The new president showed little of the public-relations polish that Mr. Presser had tried to convey.    When asked what Mr. Presser would think of his selection, Mr. McCarthy shot back, &quot;Who knows? Maybe he'd roll over in his grave.&quot; He added, &quot;You ask a goofy question, I give a goofy answer.&quot;    The reply seemed to show not only disdain for the media, but lack of reverence for Mr. Presser. Indeed, said Kenneth Paff, an official of Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a dissident Teamsters group, &quot;there was no love lost&quot; between Messrs. Presser and McCarthy.    Mr. McCarthy, in fact, already had dissented openly against the recent master freight agreement that the Presser-Mathis leadership negotiated with trucking companies. The modest contract included some wage &quot;givebacks&quot; and changes in work rules, which offended many rank-and-file members, and 64% of the affected workers voted against it. But the leadership declared it ratified, saying a two-thirds &quot;no&quot; vote is required under the Teamsters constitution to nullify a contract negotiated by the union leadership.    After his selection to be president, Mr. McCarthy said, &quot;I plan to do whatever I can to improve on (the agreement) to (satisfy) the wishes of our membership.&quot; But he didn't say how he'll try to do that.    Mr. McCarthy appears to be a modest throwback to the days of former Teamsters leaders Jimmy Hoffa and Frank Fitzsimmons, who were bluntly hostile to the media. He's &quot;an old-line union man who barks at the press,&quot; said Mr. Paff. &quot;Duke Zeller (the Teamsters press-relations chief) is thinking, 'Either I need a new job, or I'm going to have to take Pepto-Bismol every day.'&quot;    Asked about the union's bad reputation, Mr. McCarthy said it was caused by &quot;the likes of you.&quot; Why did the board meeting last so long? &quot;Good things don't come easy.&quot; What was the vote? &quot;I don't think it's any of your business.&quot; Was it 9 to 8? &quot;What are you doing -- shooting dice?&quot;    Mr. McCarthy showed pique at some attacks on the union, complaining that no one writes or broadcasts about the Teamsters' good works, such as running blood banks and vans for handicapped people.    Teamsters officials say the new president has been somewhat of an outsider in the union, and more militant than most of the leaders. He took his region's United Parcel Service workers out on strike to protest their 1976 contract, a move that, for the Teamsters, &quot;is like flying to the moon,&quot; according to Mr. Paff.    Mr. McCarthy was born in Charlestown, Mass., joined the Teamsters at the age of 17 when he took a job as a trucker, and became a union steward in 1941. He has been an officer of Local 25 for 40 years, an officer of Teamsters Joint Council 10 in five New England states since 1964, and a member of the international executive board since 1969.    He is a member of an advisory committee on labor-management relations for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the presumed Democratic presidential nominee. </TEXT></DOC>
