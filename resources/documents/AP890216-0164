In his first comments on an agreement by five Central Americancountries to disarm the Nicaraguan guerrillas, Bush acknowledged theUnited States had been caught off guard by the pact, signed Tuesday,and said, ``There are some positive elements to it and there aresome troublesome elements to it.''   Bush, on another foreign policy matter, said he hoped thatAfghanistan, with the departure of Soviet troops, could fashion ``astable, broadly based government'' without bloodshed among competingguerrilla groups.   ``The time for bloodbaths is over and I would like to see thevarious factions get together and come up with recommendations thatwould lead to a peaceful Afghanistan with no more bloodbaths,'' Bushsaid.   He refused to endorse a Soviet proposal for an immediatecease-fire in Afghanistan and an embargo on arms shipments to thecountry, expressing concern that Moscow may have stockpiled weaponsthere for the Marxist government.   ``It would not be fair to have a tremendous amount of lethalsupplies left behind and then cut off support for the resistance andthus leave an unacceptable imbalance,'' Bush said.   He made his remarks in a wide-ranging question-and-answer sessionwith eight reporters who were invited into the Oval Office. Sittingin a wing chair in front of a slow-burning fire, Bush also madethese points:   _He would ``strongly oppose'' any attempt to outlaw allsemi-automatic weapons if that would mean outlawing all pistols andrifles that could be fired continuously by repeatedly pulling thetrigger. The weapons are popular among drug gangs and one was usedin the massacre of five children in a Stockton, Calif., schoolyardlast month.   A lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, the nation'sbiggest gun lobby, Bush said, ``I'm not about to suggest that asemi-automated hunting rifle be banned.''   _He considers budget negotiations a ``two-way street'' withCongress and said he was not trying to shift to lawmakers theresponsibility for proposing unpopular cuts. Bush said he waspleased so far with congressional reaction to his $1.16 trillionspending plan for fiscal 1990.   _He wants to avoid a dispute with Federal Reserve Chairman AlanGreenspan over interest rates ``because we aren't far apart.'' TheFed has nudged up short-term interest rates in recent months as aprecaution against inflation. Bush said he did not thinkinflationary pressures in the economy warrant substantially higherinterest rates.   _He is concerned about the slow pace of personnel appointmentsfor his administration but said ``I don't think it's hurting thegovernment.'' He blamed delays on tougher rules governing thedisclosure of assets.   _He said he hopes his campaign for high ethical standards ingovernment has not ``created something that just carries things toofar.''   He expressed sympathy for Louis Sullivan, his nominee assecretary of health and human services, who gave up accumulatedsabbatical pay to join the government. Bush also said Secretary ofState James A. Baker III had ``made the right decision'' to sellstocks in a New York bank holding company that holds third-worldloans.   _Bush said ``we are far closer to West Germany than publicperceptions might be'' after Chancellor Helmut Kohl said a decisioncould be put off until 1991 on modernizing battlefield nuclearweapons in Europe. The United States and Britain are urging NATO tosupport the modernization.   The president said he wanted to ``shoot down the concept thatthere are major divisions'' between Washington and Bonn and added,``I'm not worried about NATO unity. You always worry that you haveyour act totally together . ...''   Discussing the Central American plan to close down Nicaraguanrebel bases in Honduras in return for open elections in Nicaragua,Bush said he was pleased by Ortega's talk of freedom of the press,freedom of elections and freedom of worship.   He said Ortega's regime has a history of ``promises made,promises broken.   ``And so I think we have to be wary,'' Bush said. ``Let's be surethat we not leave the resistance standing alone, leave them twistingout there without fulfillment of the commitment to democracy on thepart of the Sandinistas.''   U.S. humanitarian aid to the Nicaraguan rebels expires March 31.Asked if his comments suggested he would seek more money for theguerrillas, Bush said, ``It could mean that. It could mean that.''   Bush said, ``I don't think anybody would want to suggest that wewould leave people with no humaniarian aid. I can't imagine anyonetaking that view.''   Asked directly if he would ask Congress for more aid, Bush saidhe had some time before making that decision but added, ``I haveevery intention of seeing that these people receive humanitariansupport, but how that comes about, we'll just have to wait and see.''</TEXT></DOC>
