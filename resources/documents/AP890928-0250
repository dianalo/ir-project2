Twenty of the closings will involve dairy plants and branches tobe sold or closed in non-growth areas.   Ventres says Borden will remain committed to dairy markets whereit has been doing well.   ``We're very committed to Elsie,'' he said. ``You may sayElsie's gone on a little diet here ... but she'll be with us,''Ventres said referring to the cow that has symbolized Borden'sdairy business.   Borden, which has claimed to be the biggest dairy in the world,hasn't been losing money in dairy, Ventres said, adding ``We'rejust not making the money we want.'' It wasn't immediately knownwhether Borden will lose its No.1 ranking.   Borden's program will reduce its worldwide employment by about7,000 from the present 46,000.   Ventres said the goal of the consolidation in dairy and itsother planned moves is to make Borden a lowest-cost producer ineach of its six main businesses by 1992.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
