In 1985, the following subjects were investigatedand studied for the purpose: Based on the design and construction dataof the experimental 100 KW class aerogenerator, materials, number, cost,weight, and number of processes of each part to be affected by designmodification were analyzed. In addition, cost estimation for large scalewind turbine system and comparison with similar scale of overseas productswere made. To acquire basic data for the elucidation of wind characteristics,capes and dam sites were selected as model cases. Wind energy applicationsystems suitable for the wind characteristics in Japan were studied,and hybrid systems to work with existing and new energy systems werealso studied for possibility.</TEXT></DOC>
