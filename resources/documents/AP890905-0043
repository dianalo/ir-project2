In Hungary, at least 30 of the thousands of East Germans huddlingin refugee camps in and near Budapest said they will begin a hungerstrike on Friday if their crisis is not solved by then.   ``The situation is desperate,'' a 23-year-old East Germanidentifying himself only as Rene told reporters outside thecapital's largest refugee camp, known as Csilleberc.   Hungarian officials said they stalled a mass emigration of EastGermans to West Germany because of concern that East Berlin mightreact angrily to the unauthorized release of its citizens.   The Hamburg-based weekly magazine Stern quoted Hungarian InteriorMinister Istvan Horvath as saying resolution of the refugee crisiscould take up to 1{ months, or until West Germany and East Germanyreach agreement.   The East German state-run news agency ADN reported Horvath'sremarks and also quoted East German Foreign Ministry spokesmanWolfgang Meyer as repeating assurances that would-be emigres willnot face prosecution if they return.   As recently as Sunday, West German and Hungarian officials hadsuggested the departure was imminent of at least 4,700 East Germansstaying in tents and summer cabins at five makeshift refugee campsin Hungary.   East German refugees began fleeing to the West through Hungaryafter the liberal Communist regime in Budapest in May removed barbedwire and other obstacles from its frontier with Austria.   An estimated 6,000 East Germans have since fled to Austria. Theirfinal destination is West Germany, which gives them automaticcitizenship and generous help in starting new lives.   West German relief workers who toiled round-the-clock over theweekend to ready tent cities for the refugees in five border townssaid Monday they still assumed arrivals were imminent.   ``We still expect the first refugees within the next few days,''said Bruno Merck, president of the Bavarian Red Cross Society.   He spoke while touring the Tiefenbach camp, nestled between analfalfa field and broad-roofed Bavarian farmhouses.   ``We were informed just today that the movement would start noearlier than tomorrow, and that it could be later, but the fact ofthe matter is that none of us really knows,'' Merck said.   West German, Austrian and Hungarian officials had said last weekthat the unprecedented release of East Germans to the West couldbegin as early as last weekend.   Huge encampments of 10-person tents, feeding stations, first-aidshelters and job-finding bureaus were thrown together to help EastGermans en route to new lives in the West.   The tent cities, in which refugees were to spend their firstnights, are worked into the patchwork of cornfields, forest andpasture along a nearly 125-mile stretch of rolling Bavarian farmlandalong the Danube and Inn rivers.   ``We were told we were to have the reception camps ready bySunday night, and we worked through the night and driving rainstorms to meet that obligation,'' said Wolfgang Schmidt, director ofthe Red Cross camp in Vilshofen, across the Danube from Austria.   Asked why he thought the action had been delayed, he said,``That's a good question. But no one here can answer it.''   In Budapest, a Hungarian official said the transfer of refugeeswas stalled because of fears over how Hungary's role would be viewedby allied East Germany.   Permission to emigrate is difficult for East Germans of workingage to obtain, while travel visas to Hungary are relatively easy toget.   Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth estimated last month that as manyas 20,000 other East Germans traveling in Hungary may seek passageto West Germany. Bonn expects more than 100,000 East Germans toarrive after illegal escapes by the end of the year.   About 4,700 East Germans have formally registered with theHungarians for the westward exodus and are huddled in Red Cross tentvillages in Hungary awaiting transfer to West Germany.   Many arrived in Hungary weeks ago with only light summer clothing.   Unseasonable cold has dropped temperatures to near freezing atnight in both Hungary and at the Bavarian border camps.   ``We now have to reckon with a lot of these people arriving withweather-related illnesses,'' said a nurse stocking a medical tent inTiefenbach.   Red Cross administrators said the influx of East Germans would beeasier if it began soon and was carried out in stages, rather thantransporting thousands at once.</TEXT></DOC>
