The sourcesconsidered are solar energy, biomass, geothermal energy, wind energyand hydroelectricity and it is concluded that they could provide a smallbut useful contribution to the Community's need by 2000 and a large contributionthereafter. The background to, and views of witnesses to the Select Committeeon wind power, biomass, geothermal energy, tidal power, wave power, combinedheat and power, and related topics including the Commission's proposalsare then presented. The Commission's proposals are broadly endorsed butone area of disagreement is with the inclusion of photovoltaic conversionin the list of renewable sources, and the exclusion of wave and tidalpower. The final and major part of the report gives the minutes of theoral evidence and the written evidence received by the Select Committee.(U.K.).</TEXT></DOC>
