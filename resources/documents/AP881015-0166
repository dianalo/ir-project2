SNIFFEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Political extremist Lyndon H. LaRoucheJr. is facing new criminal charges he defrauded lenders of $34million and federal prosecutors vow this case will be resolved morequickly than their first one against him.   LaRouche, who is running for president as an independent, andsix of his associates were charged with conspiracy and fraud hereFriday by a federal grand jury which said they borrowed the moneyfrom individuals around the country over four years with nointention of repaying it.   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said the 13-count indictment was theculmination of a two-year investigation which began in October 1986with an FBI and Internal Revenue Service raid on LaRoucheheadquarters in Leesburg, Va. A truck load of documents, taperecordings and records was seized on that occasion.   LaRouche was named in all 13 counts. He was charged withconspiracy to commit mail fraud, 11 counts of mail fraud andconspiracy to defraud the IRS.   Hudson called the case a ``lean, 13-count indictment'' andpredicted it would be tried in a few weeks of testimony andcompleted before LaRouche is scheduled to be retried in Boston inearly January on other federal conspiracy charges.   There were indications that federal officials had set out toavoid or overcome what Hudson agreed was a ``blizzard of defensemotions'' which helped land the Boston case in a mistrial last Mayafter six months in court. The mistrial came when four jurorscomplained about the length and conduct of the case.   Two federal sources, who declined to be identified, said earlydrafts of the Virginia indictment contained racketeering chargeswhich top-level Justice Department officials dropped from the casebefore the grand jury was asked to vote. There have been lengthycourt challenges from defendants when the Justice Department usesracketeering charges in cases that do not involve traditionalorganized crime.   Noting the federal judges in his district ``have a reputationfor moving cases quickly,'' Hudson predicted, ``Our judges willrule with dispatch'' on any defense motions.   LaRouche's attorneys unsuccessfully sought Friday to delay theVirginia indictment until after the Nov. 8 election, saying itwould interfere with LaRouche's campaigning in 12 states and theDistrict of Columbia.   But the request for a temporary restraining order was rejectedby Judge Stanley Sporkin in Washington.   The grand jury said that LaRouche had not filed a federal incometax return since at least 1979 and conspired to conceal anundetermined amount spent on his behalf by having his livingexpenses paid out of bank accounts in the names of corporationsassociated with his major organization, the National Caucus ofLabor Committees.   The grand jury charged that during the 1984 presidentialcampaign, committees supporting LaRouche for president borrowed$4.3 million.   The grand jurors said that between late 1983 and early 1987,commercial entities controlled by LaRouche borrowed more than $30million.   The indictment said loans, from $165 to $200,000, were raised bytelephone solicitors who promised specific interest payments andspecific repayment dates, assured the lenders the loans were goodinvestments and that the organization had a good history ofrepayment, all the while knowing that LaRouche's groups had nointention of repaying the money.   The other defendants were William Wertz, described as LaRouche'sfund-raising chief; Edward Spannaus, described as LaRouche's legalchief; and four individual fund-raisers, Michael Billington, DennisSmall, Paul Greenberg and Joyce Rubinstein.   They were all charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud andvarious counts of mail fraud.   LaRouche faces a potential maximum penalty of 65 years in prisonand a fine of $3.25 million on the indictment returned Friday. Theothers would face various lesser penalties.   Hudson said he expected LaRouche and the other six defendants toappear voluntarily for arraignment in federal court on Mondayafternoon.   At a news conference outside the U.S. attorney's office, DanaScanlon, a LaRouche spokesman, called the indictment ``politicaldirty tricks'' inspired by former Justice Department criminaldivision chief William Weld, who she said had become a legalassociate of Paul Brountas, campaign manager for Democraticpresidential candidate Michael Dukakis.   She said she could not explain how the Dukakis campaign couldengineer an indictment during the Reagan administration.   Hudson rejected the allegation. ``Lyndon LaRouche is beingtreated just as any other citizen would be who is charged withcommitting a crime,'' he said.   The indictment said that LaRouche personally controlled theentire operation and told supporters the population at largeconsisted of ``freeloaders'' who ``owed'' the organization moneyfor saving them from various ``holocausts,'' and that people whodid not give money to his organization were ``not morally fit tosurvive.''</TEXT></DOC>
