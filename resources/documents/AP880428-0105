The three _ Reps. Doug Bereuter of Nebraska, Dan Burton ofIndiana and William Broomfield of Michigan _ wrote a letter tomembers of the Democratic-controlled House Foreign AffairsCommittee as the panel prepared to vote on the sanctions package.   The package would impose tough sanctions on South Africa such asprohibitions on all U.S. investment, on all imports from thatcountry, excluding strategic minerals, and on U.S. exports to thenation, except donations to relieve human suffering.   Supporters of the bill, including Rep. William Gray, D-Penn.,and Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., say the sanctions are needed because thelimited restrictions imposed on South Africa in 1986 have failed toreform the apartheid system of segregation.   But the GOP members say the sanctions have backfired in somecases, and tightening them will worsen the economic situation forblacks.   ``Apartheid is breaking down despite, not because of,sanctions,'' they said in a three-page letter. They claim thesanctions have hurt U.S. interests and stricter bans will throwblack South Africans out of work.   They cite a study by the New Jersey Division of Investment,which said New Jersey lost $365 million in pension funds because ofdivestment measures.   The GOP letter claimed that a study by COSATU, the South Africanblack labor union, estimated that 2 million more South Africanswould be out of work by the year 2000 if sanctions are increased.   The three Republicans urged their colleagues to support theirsubstitute measure which does not repeal the 1986 sanctions, butattempts to target U.S. assistance to blacks.   Among other things, the substitute would provide housing loanguarantees to blacks and encourage U.S. businesses to help theblack business sector.   They said the substitute would lead to positive developments inthe black community, in contrast to the Dellums-Wolpe legislation,which ``takes a total `scorched earth' approach.''</TEXT></DOC>
