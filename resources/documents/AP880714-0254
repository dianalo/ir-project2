In a statement, the company said it ``has been cooperating withthe Office of the U.S. Attorney in Tucson, Ariz., in itsinvestigation of a contract with the Army Communications Centerbased in Fort Huachuca.''   A story in the Wall Street Journal Wednesday said the U.S.Attorney's Office in Tucson planned to seek criminal chargesagainst a Unisys unit and two company officials.   The overcharges in computer could reach as much as $10 million,the Journal said. They stem from several years of work on the ArmyInformation Systems Command in Fort Huachuca, Ariz.   However, Wren Timberlake, a spokesman at the Arizona base, saidthe entire contract in question was for $9.2 million.   Unisys said it totaled $8 million, and that the allegedovercharges did not exceed $250,000. The company said the contractwith the Army was entered into in 1982 by Sperry Corp., whichmerged with Burroughs Corp. in 1986 and became Unisys.   ``If there were overcharges, they were significantly less than$10 million,'' Timberlake said.   ``I'm not certain the alleged charges involved any money at all.The alleged administrative shortcoming involved in this case wasmore the procedural irregularities in the way the government wasbilled,'' he said.   The Journal reported that Unisys had ``voluntarily disclosed theproblems at Fort Huachuca, provided additional information to theJustice Department as the investigation progressed and pledged totake corrective action to prevent recurrence.''   The company has three contracts with the Army at Fort Huachuca,totaling $70 million, Timberlake said, adding that the Army andUnisys continue to have a ``fine relationship.''   Unisys had $9.7 billion in revenues last year, of which 25percent, or $2.4 billion, came from defense work.</TEXT></DOC>
