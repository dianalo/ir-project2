Group revenue could rise 30% this year, to 38 trillion lire ($30.2 billion), according to the company. That would follow a 44% increase last year, to 29.3 trillion lire. Operating earnings could rise 22%, to three trillion lire. Last year, Fiat, which is Italy's largest private-sector company, posted record net income of 2.162 trillion lire, up 63%.    Fiat holds the largest share of the European auto market, with 15.3%. It is followed by Volkswagen AG, at 14.8%.    Even though Fiat expects continued earnings growth, it has said that it will take another two years for Alfa, which Fiat acquired last year, to contribute to group profit. </TEXT></DOC>
