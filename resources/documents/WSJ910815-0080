The giant aqueduct, estimated to cost $150 billion, woulddeliver one trillion gallons of Alaskan water annually toSouthern California -- about 10% of the water used in theentire state -- through pipes stretching more than 2,000miles. Much of that route would be beneath the ocean.</LP><TEXT>   Alaska Gov. Walter Hickel, who has championed the idea for20 years, sees it as a simple solution to a troubling issue.&quot;You've got a problem, and the Arctic has a lot of water,&quot;the governor told politicians and water experts gathered inLos Angeles by the Office of Technology Assessment, an arm ofCongress.   California has blossomed with elaborate and oftenexpensive ways to beat the drought. Desalting plants inMexico, fired by natural gas from Texas, have been proposed.Towing icebergs has been considered. And redirection ofrivers, from the Columbia between the states of Washingtonand Oregon to the Mackenzie River in the Canadian Arctic, hasbeen suggested.   But no plan seems quite as elaborate, or quite asexpensive, as Gov. Hickel's undersea pipeline. Engineers notethat the proposed scheme would rank in scope with such vastprojects as the Panama Canal and the tunnel under the EnglishChannel. And environmentalists suggest it could be apotential nightmare.   Still, a small but powerful political constituency hasemerged in Southern California to support the proposal.   A broad split developed at yesterday's workshop, withenvironmentalists on one side and engineering andconstruction interests on the other. For their part,politicians seemed more worried about the region's thirstthan the enormous cost and the issue of which governmentaljurisdictions might be called on to pay it.   &quot;What will happen to California if we don't have water?&quot;asked Kenneth Hahn, one of Los Angeles's five powerful countysupervisors and a key supporter of the line. As Mr. Hahn seesit, California's industrial and agricultural tax base wouldcollapse if a surge of water doesn't feed the state'sgrowth-minded economy. &quot;It will bankrupt the state,&quot; Mr. Hahnargued.   But environmentalists and city water planners criticizedthe scheme.   &quot;For years California has looked at water like a thirstyvampire, and the vampire is out of control again with thisproject,&quot; said Robert Hattoy, Southern California-Nevadadirector of the Sierra Club, adding that he wanted &quot;to drivea stake through the heart&quot; of the pipeline.   The pipeline's $150 billion estimated cost would dwarf notonly the $24.1 billion borrowed by the state and all itslocal governments for all purposes last year, but would alsoexceed the $126.4 billion borrowed nationwide by state andlocal governments, said a unit of Fluor Corp., theengineering firm based in Irvine, Calif., that prepared thepreliminary cost estimates.   The cost is such that federal financing could well berequired, workshop participants noted.   But Gov. Hickel argued that the cost could be as little as&quot;the cost of a Coke a day&quot; to an average Californian. TheAlaska governor, who was a secretary of the interior in theNixon administration, said he hadn't carefully considered theproject's financing. &quot;I'm a problem solver,&quot; he said in aninterview before the workshop.   Gov. Hickel argued that the project could be built forless than the Fluor estimate. &quot;You have to be creative,&quot; hesaid, suggesting that, instead of steel and concrete, fourhuge fiberglass or plastic pipes, 14 feet in diameter, run inparallel down the continental shelf off the Canadian coast.Gov. Hickel said he hadn't checked with the Canadiangovernment about the proposed route. Canadian governmentofficials had no comment.   As projected, the undersea line would run from SouthernAlaska to a point in Northern California, where it would bebrought on land. Water then would enter the state'sdistribution system, which probably would need bolstering toabsorb the boost in supply.   California state and local water officials said water fromthe pipeline would be the most costly ever proposed, roughlydouble that of any supplies brought by tanker from Canada ordrawn from the sea and desalted. At about 1.2 cents a gallon,the cost would be more than 20 times that of SouthernCalifornia's current water sources.   The pipeline's principal competition comes fromconservation and reorganization of water use, the officialssaid. Strict controls on water use and extensive advertisingcampaigns have cut consumption by 30% and more in someCalifornia communities.   Moreover, agriculture interests, which account for about70% of the state's water consumption, have been selling waterto municipal water authorities, a trend that some seecontinuing even when the drought ends.   &quot;We have enough water in this state; it's just pricedinequitably and used in efficiently,&quot; Christine Reed, amember of the regional Metropolitan Water District's board,told pipeline proponents.</TEXT></DOC>
