I'll tell you what's wrong: Toomany kinds of sneakers.;    This problem was driven home to me dramaticallywhen my 10-year-old son decided to join a track club. At first I was in favorof this, because I was a track man myself back at Pleasantville High School,where in 1965 -- and I hope I do not sound too boastful here -- I set a NewYork state record for Shortest Time On A Track Team Before Quitting.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  West  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  FOOTING THE BILL  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     My original goal was to obtain a Varsity Letter. I needed one because atthe time I was madly in love with Ann Weinberg, who would have been the idealwoman except for one serious flaw: She was an excellent athlete. On an averageafternoon she would win the state championship in about nine sports. When wehad the annual school awards assembly, various teams would troop on and offthe auditorium stage, but Ann would just remain up there, getting honored,until all you could see was a large, Ann-shaped mound of trophies.;    Thiscaused painful feelings of inadequacy in me, a small chestless insecure malewhose only recognized high-school athletic achievement was the time when,through an amazing physical effort, I managed to avoid ralphing directly ontothe shoes of the principal as he was throwing me out of a pep rally dance forattempting to sleep under the refreshments table. Unfortunately this is notthe kind of achievement for which you get a Varsity Letter.;    So in adesperation effort to impress Ann, I joined the track team. This meant I hadto go into the locker room with large hairy jocks who appeared way too old forhigh school. I bet you knew guys like that. At the time I thought that theyhad simply matured faster than I had, but I now realize that they wereactually 40-year-old guys who chose to remain in high school for an extracouple of decades because they enjoyed snapping towels at guys like me. Theyare probably still there.;    I was under the impression that all you had todo, to obtain your Varsity Letter, was spend a certain amount of time in thelocker room, but it turned out that they had a picky rule under which you alsohad to run or jump or hurl certain objects in an athletic manner, which in mycase was out of the question, so I quit.;    However, during my brief time onthe team I did learn some important lessons that have stayed with methroughout life, the main one being that if you are on the track-team bus, andthe coach comes striding down the aisle and demands to know which team memberhurled the &quot;moon&quot; -- which is not one of the approved objects that you hurl intrack -- out the bus window at the police officer who is now threatening toarrest the entire team, you should deny that you saw anything, because it'sbetter to go to jail than to betray the sacred trust of your teammates andconsequently be forced to eat a discus.;    So I was glad that my son becameinterested in this character-building sport, until he announced that he needednew sneakers. This troubled me, because he already had new sneakers, whichcost approximately as much as an assault helicopter but are moretechnologically advanced. They are the heavily advertised sneakers that havelittle air pumps inside. This feature provides an important orthopedicbenefit: It allows the manufacturer to jack the price way up. Also it turnsthe act of walking around into a highly complex process. &quot;Wait!&quot; my son willsay, as we're rushing off to school, late as usual. &quot;I have to pump more airinto my sneakers!&quot; Because God forbid you should go to school underinflated.;   So I figured that high-powered sneakers like these would be fine for track,but both my wife and my son gently informed me that I am a total idiot. Itturns out you don't run in pump sneakers. What you do, in pump sneakers, ispump your sneakers. For running, you need a completely different kind ofsneakers, for which you have to pay a completely different set of U.S.dollars.;    Not only that, but the sneaker salesperson informed me that,depending on the kind of running my son was going to do, he might need severalkinds of sneakers. The salesperson's tone of voice carried the clearimplication that he was going to call the Child Abuse Hot Line if I didn'tcare enough, as a parent, to take out a second mortgage so I could purchasesufficient sneakerage for my son.;    I have done a detailed scientific surveyof several other parents, and my current estimate is that sneakers now absorb83 percent of the average U.S. family income. This has to stop. We needCongress to pass a law requiring the sneaker industry to return to the systemwe had when I was growing up, under which there was only one kind of sneakers,namely U.S. Keds, which were made from Army surplus tents and which cost about$10, or roughly $1 per pound.;    This simple act would make our nation strongagain. Slow, but strong. Probably your reaction is, &quot;Dave, that's an excellentidea, and you should receive, at minimum, the Nobel Prize.&quot; Thank you, but asan American, I am not in this because I seek fame and glory. All I seek, as anAmerican, is a Varsity Letter.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Dave Barry column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910127  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  23  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  953  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday January 27, 199100027245,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
