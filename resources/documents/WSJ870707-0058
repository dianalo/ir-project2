Freeport is offering public investors 39 million shares of the 144 million outstanding at 1.35 Australian dollars (97 cents) each in an issue aimed at raising 52.7 million dollars ($37.8 million).    In late June, Australian investment institutions purchased 15 million shares of the unit, also at 1.35 dollars each, for a total of 20.3 million dollars.    The U.S. parent kept all of the proceeds of the sale to the investment institutions. The parent also will keep 20 million dollars from the public sale, reflecting its investment in exploration and development operations in the unit.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Freeport closed at $25.375 a share, up 25 cents.    Freeport said the spinoff is aimed at enhancing shareholder values and is similar to previous restructurings of the company's oil, gold, agricultural minerals and geothermal assets.    Freeport-McMoRan Australia's main interests are 75% of a gold prospect at Karonie, Western Australia, and 80% of the Bow River diamond project. </TEXT></DOC>
