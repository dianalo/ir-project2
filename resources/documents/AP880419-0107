(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New guidelines designed to eliminatedisparity in sentencing will deprive judges of their independence,say some federal jurists who met to consider the issue.   The U.S. Sentencing Commission, organized in 1984 as an arm ofthe federal judiciary, adopted the sweeping guidelines lastNovember in an attempt to end the disparities in criminalsentencing.   ``They're cold and implacable and as immutable as a computer,''said U.S. District Judge James Ideman, one of 20 federal judges whomet Monday.   Donald A. Purdy Jr., representing the commission, said theguidelines were developed to increase respect for the law byensuring that defendants are sentenced fairly. He cited a 1974study of 50 judges that found sentences for the same crime rangedfrom three to 20 years.   The U.S. Supreme Court will make the final determination on theguidelines.   Several of the judges expressed irritation at the notion of anyindependent commission fixing sentencing options for federal judges.   The guidelines, proposed at Congress' direction, established arange of penalties for all federal crimes that occurred after Nov.1. Minimum and maximum penalties do not vary more than 25 percentand judges aren't permitted to deviate unless a case involvesfactors not considered by the commission.   The controversial guidelines have prompted divided opinions fromdistrict judges throughout the country.   Opponents have argued that the commission, as an arm of thejudicial branch, did not have authority to assume what has been afunction of the legislative branch.   ``What it does is it destroys all the discretionary function ofa judge and it gives an opportunity for prosecutorialmisbehavior,'' U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian said Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
