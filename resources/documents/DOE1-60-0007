In the ASEANcountries alone, postharvest losses of cereals are estimated at 30 percent,fruits and vegetables at 20 to 40 percent, and up to 50 percent for fish.Some products in Africa suffer postharvest losses as high as 50 percent.One of the best responses to the problem of world hunger is preservationof what has already been grown. If postharvest losses worldwide couldbe minimized, food supply gains could be made without allocation of additionalresources. The problems of food production, processing and storage requirea continuing search for effective, technically and economically feasiblealternative methods of food preservation. Food irradiation is not a panaceafor this problem, however. Alone, it cannot change conditions or solvethe problems of world hunger, but it can become a factor in the improvementof conditions where improved human nutrition is an immediate need. Foodirradiation has progressed steadily over the past 40 years in terms ofresearch, development, and legislative or regulatory activities.</TEXT></DOC>
