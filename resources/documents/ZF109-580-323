(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>New lease of life?andM;NCR is not a name commonly associated with daring and innovation.andP;  Companieslike Apple and latterly Sun, are widely accepted as the computer industry'syoung turks, while NCR is best remembered as a somewhat stodgy purveyor ofrespectable mid-range technology -- the Tower series notwithstanding -- witha profitable sideline in ATMs.andP;  The release of the System 3000 family ofcomputers (see news, issue 142) will completely change this image and maymake NCR one of the key IT companies of the 1990s.andM;NCR's staid image has never been an entirely fair reflection of the company,which as early as 1979 had moved to microprocessor-based systems for itsmid-range machines.andP;  It was also one of the first companies to embrace opensystems.andM;NCR showed distinct signs of wanting to shake off this also-ran image thistime last year; it became one of the first vendors to announce a 486 box.andO;Company officials also made some predictable 'visionary noises' about howthey intended to make NCR a proactive (sic) rather than a reactive company.andM;They conceded that, in common with many of its mid-range peers, it hadentered the PC market with a token product line -- using ALR technology --essentially as a holding operation to prevent PC vendors encroaching onexisting NCR sites.andM;However, 1989 saw the company undergo a conversion akin to that of Paul onthe road to Damascus and it came to the conclusion that the enormousinstalled base of PCs meant that PC standards were likely to dominate thewhole computing market.andM;Even in the Unix arena the best-selling brand in SCO's Xenix/Unix is designedto run over Intel 386/486 processors.andP;  The installed base of such machinesdwarfs those of any of the RISC architectures such as SPARC or MIPS.andM;As a result, NCR came to the conclusion that the role of a hardware vendorshould cease to be primarily one of selling technology designed andmanufactured in house, but rather one where existing standard technologiesare marketed as building blocks for complete systems.andP;  In short, NCR ismoving towards the goal which manufacturers like IBM, DEC and Bull have setthemselves -- to become systems integrators.andM;NCR's recently announced System 3000 range uses cheap and establishedhardware technologies such as MCA and SCSI and runs industry standard systemssoftware (see table) such as DOS, OS/2 and Unix.andM;NCR thus enjoys the benefits of low-cost production as it can source itsindustry-standard volume produced components cheaply and concentrate onadding value in the growth areas of services and customising software.andM;For hardware producers like DEC, Wang and Prime to survive in the cut-throatworld of open systems -- where hardware becomes just another low-margincommodity product -- it is this model they will have to adopt.andM;What is astonishing about NCR's recent announcement of its System 3000 familyof machines is the extent to which the company has committed itself to thispath.andM;Uniquely among hardware vendors offering a full range of machines from the PCthrough the mid-range right up to mainframes and beyond, NCR has chosen tobase its entire range on a single processor architecture -- the Intel 80x86family.andM;In the past, DEC made a virtue of the scalability of its product line whichwas all based on the VAX architecture.andP;  While customers expected to buymachines based on proprietary technology, DEC was immensely successful -- itbecame the world's second largest computer company.andM;However, even a company of DEC's size -- it has annual global sales in excessof $12 billion -- was unable to ignore the unrelenting rise of the PCstandard.andM;As a result, DEC has had to abandon the compatibility it offered across itsentire range and offer an entry-level machine which is a PC.andP;  By contrast,NCR has decided to build upwards from the PC and because its entire range isbased on Intel CPUs it is object code-compatible, which means that softwarecan be run unaltered on any machine in the range for a given operatingsystem.andM;The contrast with IBM's SAA (Systems Application Architecture) whichtortuously attempts to offer inter-operability between two mainframeoperating systems (VM and MVS), one mini-computer operating system (OS/400)and one rather poorly accepted PC operating system (OS/2) could not begreater.andM;This does, however, beg the question: if NCR's strategy for the System 3000range is so good, why isn't everyone else doing it?andM;First, the technologies which underpin the whole range are only justappearing.andP;  NCR's new babies rely on multi-processing technology recentlydeveloped by Teradata, in which NCR has a ten per cent stake.andP;  On the sameday that NCR announced the System 3000 family, ATandamp;T's semi-autonomous Unixdivision, USL (formerly the USO) unveiled plans to ship a multi-processingversion of Unix System V 4.0 in the first half of next year.andM;Another reason why NCR will not be followed by the likes of IBM and DEC, isthat both companies have such an enormous installed base of customers usingproprietary equipment.andP;  NCR's existing customer base is significantly smallerand much of it is already wedded to open systems due to NCR's earlyconversion to the cause.andP;  NCR maintains that it will continue to support anddevelop its existing I, V and Tower series lines, but undoubtedly the bulk ofits efforts will be devoted to the System 3000.andM;There is, however, one big worry associated with NCR's strategy, by basingits line solely on Intel's processors, NCR has to rely solely on one companyfor the most important component across its complete product range.andP;  Not onlyhas Intel guarded its right to be the sole source of all its 32-bitmicroprocessors, there have already been shortages of both SX and 486 chips.andM;NCR claims that, in the event of any difficulties with Intel, its machinesare sufficiently flexible to accommodate the use of different processortypes, although it has no plans at present to implement such a course ofaction.andM;NCR is also probably relieved to see that other chip companies like AMD,NexGen and Chips andamp; Technologies have all pledged to deliver 386 and, in somecases 486, compatible chips within the next 12 months.andM;However, even if NCR does eventually second source some of its chips fromrival companies, Intel could possibly be the biggest beneficiary of theSystem 3000 line should it become a big success.andP;  The System 3000 is, afterall, a stunning endorsement of Intel and the 80x86 CPU architecture.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
