It is all part of a push by arms makers world-wide toboost sales and improve sagging financial performance. Italso reflects a growing effort by French state agencies tobegin behaving more like companies.</LP><TEXT>   Earlier this year, the French government's main maker ofmunitions, cannons, tanks and armored vehicles shortened itslong, complicated name to Giat Industries. It ceased to be astate agency and became a corporation -- albeit stillgovernment-owned. It immediately announced plans to stemlosses, expand slumping exports, and lay off employees.   The shipbuilders' goal is more modest. They don't want tobecome a corporation or lay anyone off. They just want theright to create a commercially registered sales subsidiarycalled DCNI, short for Direction des ConstructionsNavales-Industrie. Then they want to begin an export drive.   Until now, the DCN says, it has viewed its main job simplyas supplying the French navy. It designs ships and overseesplants that build them.   It has been treated as another government bureaucracy, andhad to go through a cumbersome process to make an exportsale. The result has been poor export performance. The DCNwon't say exactly how much of its 20 billion francs ($3.79billion) in sales last year were exports, but says exportswere well below Giat's figure of 10% of total production.   A spokesman says the DCN hopes the Finance Ministry willapprove the new company within a few weeks. First, the DCNneeds to calm official worries that the new company wouldmark a step away from full government control.   The DCN's idea is similar to Giat's: Boost efficiency andbuild cooperation with non-government companies, both Frenchand foreign. And while the DCN doesn't calculate profits andlosses, it would want its sales subsidiary to show earnings.   &quot;Currently,&quot; the DCN official said, &quot;we don't have theright to form joint ventures or to handle our own exportsales. We must build and design ships and subs ourselves, andwhen we want to sell abroad, we have to work through one ofthe state export agencies. We are hoping to get moreflexibility.&quot;   The official said the DCN has been lobbying for more thantwo years to create the company. The changes at Giat havemade the change seem more urgent.   Giat Chairman Pierre Chiquet said in April that he hopesto cut staff more than 10% by 1992. He said he hopes to endlosses, now 10% of sales, by 1994. And this month, he saidGiat has agreed to cooperate with a division of GeneralElectric Co. of Fairfield, Conn., (unrelated to the Britishcompany of the same name), to develop and make a cannonturret for light helicopters, which they hope to sell to theU.S. Army.</TEXT></DOC>
