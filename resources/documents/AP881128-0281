The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed inVienna to set a daily production quota of 18.5 million barrels and atarget price of $18 a barrel. The announcement triggered a$1-a-barrel increase in oil prices.   The biggest U.S. banks raised their prime lending rates a halfpercentage point to 10.5 percent, the fourth increase this year.   Some analysts said the dollar's rise was hard to explain becausethe prime rate increase had been widely expected and an increase inoil prices usually does not give a big boost to the dollar. Butthere were no other ready explanations for the dollar's ascent.   ``It's a fairly impressive move by the dollar,'' said CraigSloane, a currency analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.
