Throughout the term, the high court attempted to reversewhat its new conservative majority believes was excessiveexpansion of the rights of accused people during the 1960s.</LP><TEXT>   The pronounced law-and-order turn of the court culminatedyesterday with the justices' 6-3 ruling overturning a 1987precedent and allowing use of information about victims'families in death-penalty sentencing. The justices alsoruled, 5-4, that the Constitution doesn't bar mandatory lifeimprisonment for a first drug offense.   &quot;We are really seeing a solid conservative majority emergein the criminal-law area, almost across the board,&quot; says AlanSlobodin, a lawyer with the conservative Washington LegalFoundation. Some say the court has run roughshod over civilliberties.   This month marked anniversaries of two of the mostimportant rulings ever for the rights of defendants. In June1961, the Supreme Court applied the exclusionary rule to thestates, ruling that evidence obtained in violation of theFourth Amendment's protection from improper searches couldn'tbe used in a criminal trial. And in 1966, the court issuedthe Miranda decision, which said the Fifth Amendmentprotection against self-incrimination requires police to warnsuspects of their rights before taking them into custody andinterrogating them.   This term, the court's concerns ran largely in the otherdirection. The justices made it easier for police with nowarrants to search buses for drugs or to open and examinesuitcases or paper bags they find in the trunks of cars. Thecourt also allowed prosecutors to use some coercedconfessions as evidence against defendants, and it authorizedthe jailing of individuals for up to 48 hours without a courthearing, during which time police could work to see if thereis probable cause for the arrest.   Yesterday's decision to allow the use of so-called victimimpact information in death-penalty cases culminated aconservative effort that began almost as soon as the 1987ruling banning use of such information in capital cases wasannounced. The earlier decision was by a 5-4 vote. Withsubsequent changes in the makeup of the court, that slimmajority disappeared, but the conservative justices wereunable to muster enough votes in two previous attempts tooverrule the 1987 decision.   Yesterday, however, in an opinion written by Chief JusticeWilliam Rehnquist, the votes were there and the earlierdecision was cast aside, with Justice David Souter joiningthe majority. Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun andJohn Stevens dissented. (Payne vs. Tennessee)   In yesterday's other ruling, the justices substantiallyweakened a 1983 decision that said the Eighth Amendmentprohibition of &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; requires that acriminal sentence be proportionate to the crime. In anopinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the court said aMichigan law that required a life sentence for possession of672 grams of cocaine, may be &quot;unusual,&quot; but isn't &quot;cruel&quot; andisn't unconstitutional. (Harmelin vs. Michigan)   The tough turn in the high court's approach wasforeshadowed 23 years ago, when Richard Nixon campaigned forpresident vowing to appoint justices who would show moresupport for victims and the police. But even though Mr. Nixonnamed four justices, his law-and-order court never fullymaterialized. The court of the 1970s tinkered quite a bit,but fundamentally altered relatively little.   All that has changed. &quot;The conservative court has thevotes and it's off and running,&quot; says Yale Kamisar, aprofessor at the University of Michigan Law School. &quot;Thereare virtually no constraints on them,&quot; says Louis MichaelSeidman, a Georgetown University Law School professor.   Nowhere has this been more apparent than in death-penaltycases.   First, in two major decisions this year, the high courtcut back sharply on the availability to death row inmates offederal habeas corpus -- a civil lawsuit filed most often bya convicted prisoner whose appeals have been denied and whoclaims that his arrest or trial was unconstitutional. In the1960s, the Supreme Court vastly expanded federal court reviewof state criminal convictions.   Chief Justice Rehnquist has long argued that the system isabused by prisoners who file one habeas corpus petition afteranother, causing their executions to be deferred for years.Rather than wait for Congress to curtail the alleged abuses,the high court took matters in its own hands.   The justices set tougher standards for inmates who filesecond habeas petitions to prove that their claims couldn'thave been raised in their first petition. The justices alsoruled that federal courts shouldn't consider first habeaspetitions if those petitions didn't comply with state courtprocedural rules.   &quot;They've really almost done away with habeas corpus,&quot; saysProfessor Kamisar.   The track record isn't all one-sided. The court threw outa few death sentences and, perhaps in honor of the Mirandadecision's 25th anniversary, ruled that once a suspect hasasked to consult a lawyer, police can't resume questioningunless the lawyer is present.</TEXT></DOC>
