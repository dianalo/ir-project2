Treasury is reducing the current per-itemfee structure for large depositaries that process FTD dollar deposit volumesin excess of $10 million annually. The affected depositaries include depositariesin the remittance option Class 1 category and the note option Class B andClass C categories. Until further evaluation is completed, fee reductionswill not be implemented for depositaries that process the smaller FTD dollardeposit volumes (depositaries in the note option Class A category and remittanceoption Class 2 category) or any depositary that participates in the FederalGovernment's Minority Bank Deposit Program (MBDP).Treasury finds, for good cause, that a delay in the rule's effective datewould be contrary to the important public interest of meeting budgetaryconstraints imposed on the Financial Management Service. <T3>See</T3> S. Rep. No. 387, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 16 (1988). Thus, thisrule shall be effective upon publication as a final rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.

Salapka at (202) 287-0590.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On January 3, 1989, Treasury publisheda notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the amendment in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> [54 FR 40]. In the notice of proposed rulemaking,interested persons were given until February 2, 1989, to submit comments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Final Rule and Comments</ITAG>In order to achieve budget reductions in Fiscal Year 1989, Treasury isreducing the per-item fee paid to the large note option and remittanceoption depositaries from the current fifty ($0.50) cents per Federal taxdeposit coupon processed to thirty ($0.30) centes for each Federal taxdeposit coupon processed. Payment of fees for processing FTD payments isnot required by statute. Therefore, Treasury is transferring these administrativeprocedures to the ``Treasury Financial Manual.'' This manual may be obtainedfrom any Federal Reserve Bank.Four comments were timely received and a fifth comment was received afterthe comment period had expired. The first comment was from an associationrepresenting the interest of independent banks. The request regarded clarificationon the effect of the fee reduction on the note option depositaries. Specifically,the association inquired as to the size of depositaries which would beaffected. Treasury responded that fees would not be reduced for the depositariesprocessing less than $10 million annually in Federal tax deposit volumeor any depositary participating in the MBDP.The second comment was received from an association of banking institutions.It addressed the cost associated with accepting Federal tax deposits. Theassociation suggested that depositaries processing the largest dollar depositvolumes incur increased processing risks. Furthermore, the associationrequested that depositaries be given the option of recovering their processingcosts from their customers by charging a fee for handling Federal tax deposits.The association acknowledged that depositaries receive compensation forhandling costs from the Treasury fee paid for each FTD coupon processedand the overnight use of deposited funds.The intent of Treasury's policy is to reduce fees for the largest depositariesbecause they are in a more favorable position to accommodate the changein fee structure than the smaller depositaries. The larger depositariesprocess the largest dollar deposit volumes and generally benefit most fromthe overnight use of Federal funds. Regarding processing risks it shouldbe noted that current regulations provide that depositaries may at theirdiscretion accept checks drawn on another financial institution, but theydo so purely on a voluntary basis. 31 CFR 214.6(a)(1).Regarding processing costs, the association suggested that depositariesrecover processing costs from their customers. This issue was not addressedin the proposed rule. Current regulations forbid depositaries to acceptcompensation from taxpayers for accepting deposits of Federal taxes andhandling them. 31 CFR 214.6(a)(7). Treasury has determined, as a policymatter, that amending this regulation to allow depositaries to charge taxpayersfor providing this service is not appropriate at this time: The proposedrule did not speak to this provision of concern to the association andit will be reviewed independently for consideration of its continued validity.The third comment was from an association representing independent communitybanks opposing the removal of the fee schedule from the CFR. The associationstated that Treasury should be required to consider the bookkeeping andmaintenance costs of banks when establishing its fee structure. The associationcited results of a survey among community banks with assets ranging from$10 million to $100 million and stated that the costs to process FTD paymentsranged from $1.05 to $0.35 per item. The survey indicated that costs declinedas the size of the institution increased. The association stressed thatcurrent fees do not fully compensate many community banks and that a reductionin fees would be a hardship for smaller institutions.Treasury has determined, as a policy matter, to transfer the administrativeprocedures concerning payment of fees for processing FTD payments to the``Treasury Financial Manual.'' However, this change will not preclude publiccomment. It is the Department of the Treasury's intent to announce futurerate changes prior to their effective date and allow opportunity for publiccomment.There are three reasons for Treasury's policy regarding FTD payments. First,budget constraints imposed on the Financial Management Service precludepaying higher fees to depositaries. Second, depositaries that choose toparticipate in the Treasury Tax and Loan program earn interest on the overnightuse of Federal funds deposited as Federal tax payments. Third, Treasuryhas determined that the larger depositaries are in a better position toaccommodate the fee reduction.The fourth comment was received from an association representing approximately3,000 savings associations and savings bank businesses. The comment suggestedthat the Treasury and depositaries should work together to establish asystematic and unbiased method for deriving an annual fee and that a preciseformula should be developed and approved through the public comment process.Furthermore, the association suggested that to arrive at an appropriateprofit margin, the Treasury should convene a task force comprised of financialindustry representatives and others to set the rate and publish it in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> for comment. As stated above, budget constraintspreclude Treasury from paying higher fees. In addition, Treasury estimatesthe earning capacity of depositaries from the overnight use of Federaltax deposit funds during Fiscal Year 1988 was approximately $142 million.This estimate is based on the FY 1988 Federal tax deposit dollar volumecited in the ``Daily Treasury Statement'' dated September 30, 1988. Furthermore,Treasury estimates that implementing the new fee structure will save theTreasury $6 million in Fiscal Year 1989.The fifth comment was received from a savings bank. The bank stated thatthe Treasury proposal to reduce fees ignores the cost of the processingrisk associated with accepting Federal tax deposits and the fifth ($.50)cent fee does not cover the bank's actual processing cost. The bank suggestedremoving the restriction which prohibits depositaries from accepting compensationfrom taxpayers to allow banks to cover their processing costs. These issueswere addressed in Treasury's response to the second comment. <T3>See</T3> discussion above.There are no substantive differences between the proposed rule and finalrule. Subsequent to the publication of the proposed rule, Treasury increasedthe threshold between the note option Class A and Class B categories to$10 million in annual Federal tax deposit dollar volume. As a consequenceof this policy decision, fewer note option depositaries are affected bythe fee reduction than originally estimated. The threshold between theremittance option Class 1 and Class 2 categories is also increased to $10million.Treasury is reducing fees paid to all depositaries that process over $10million in Federal tax deposit dollar volume annually, regardless of classificationas note option or remittance option depositaries. However, there is anexception for the MBDP participants. MBDP participants are not affectedby the fee reduction. Fee reductions for depositaries that process thesmaller FTD dollar deposit volumes and depositaries that participate inthe MBDP are under review. Treasury will decide at a later date when feereductions, if any, will be implemented for the smaller depositaries andMBDP depositaries. The new and any subsequent fee schedules will be publishedin the ``Treasury Financial Manual'' and an opportunity will be affordedfor public comment prior to further reductions becoming final.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Assessment and Certification</ITAG>Approximately 3,400 financial institutions participate as note option depositarieswhile greater than 11,600 financial institutions participate as remittanceoption depositaries. Treasury estimates that approximately 4,000 financialinstitutions will be affected by the fee reduction. The larger financialinstitutions process the largest dollar deposit volumes and generally benefitmost from the overnight use of Federal funds. Therefore, Treasury has determinedthat the initial fee reduction will be limited to those depositaries thatprocess over $10 million in FTD deposits annually.Distribution of the revised ``Treasury Financial Manual'' to the FederalReserve banks and TTandamp;L depositaries will be coordinated with the regulationrevisions.Treasury has determined that this is not a major rule as defined by ExecutiveOrder 12291. Accordingly, a regulatory impact analysis is not required.It is hereby certified pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act thatthis rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. Accordingly, a Regulatory Flexibility Act analysisis not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>31 CFR Part 203Banks, Banking, Taxes.31 CFR Part 214Banks, Banking, Taxes.For the reasons set out in the preamble, Title 31, Part 203 and Part 214of the Code of Federal Regulations, is amended as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 203_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
