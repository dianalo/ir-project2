The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration said its six-month investigation found that 620 employees at the company's plant in Dakota City, Neb., where it is headquartered, had extensive exposure to an occupational illness called cumulative trauma disorder. This is a condition involving injury caused by repeated hand, wrist and arm motions during work.    The condition of the IBP workers is mainly one known as carpal tunnel syndrome, in which the nerve passing through the wrist to the hand is pinched and compressed because of fast, repeated, forceful motions, OSHA said. One reason for the numerous instances of cumulative trauma disorder at the Nebraska plant was an increase in the speed of the meat cutting and handling line, said Frank White, deputy assistant secretary of labor for OSHA.    IBP, 51%-owned by Occidental Petroleum Corp., said it believes OSHA's action is &quot;just wrong&quot; and will be overturned through the court system.    &quot;This is a major health hazard in one of the most dangerous occupations in the country, and we want the meatpacking industry in general and IBP in particular to eliminate the problem,&quot; Mr. White said. OSHA said the IBP citations are expected to focus national attention on cumulative trauma disorder.    Disorders of the hand, wrist, shoulders and back due to repetitive movements are an &quot;epidemic,&quot; according to the AFL-CIO's food and allied service trades division, which contends that such problems afflict nearly half of meatpacking workers, 60% of cashiers using supermarket laser scanners and 25% of telephone workers.    OSHA has cited several companies for carpal tunnel syndrome violations, including Cincinnati-based Kroger Co., Chrysler Corp., based in Highland Park, Mich., and U S West Inc.'s Mountain Bell unit in Denver. </TEXT></DOC>
