Vice President George Bushreaffirmed his opposition to tax hikes.   Dukakis also said in a private meeting with fund-raisers that hewould consider ``geographical balance'' in deciding his vicepresidential running mate and would look for someone with a``substantive background that supplements my own,'' according toone person who attended the session.   The Massachusetts governor has come under pressure from someDemocats to select a running mate from the West or the South toprovide geographical balance to the ticket. He frequently has beenadvised to pick someone with greater experience in foreign policyand defense matters than he has accumulated in 10 years in theBoston Statehouse.   Jackson, nearing the end of his remarkable, but losing, primarycampaign, walked along a garbage-strewn beach in New Jersey andcalled on corporations and the federal government to take a moreactive role in fighting pollution.   Dukakis is expected to clinch the Democratic nomination nextweek when the final primary elections of the Democratic campaignare held in California, New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico.   Both Dukakis and Bush worked Wednesday at unifying their partiesfor what both sides predict will be a tense, tight fall election.   The Massachusetts governor enlisted the support of nearly 30Democratic National Convention delegates, many of whom earliersupported dropout candidate Albert Gore Jr. Dukakis also met overbreakfast with fund-raisers for Gore and Rep. Richard Gephardt aspart of his campaign's effort to help raise $50 million for use bythe national and state parties in the fall campaign.   Bush's campaign _ which sewed up the Republican nominationseveral weeks ago _ showed off a little unity of its own when Sen.Charles Grassley and Gov. Terry Branstad formally announced theirdecision to head the GOP effort in Iowa.   ``We know it won't be easy'' to carry the state, said Branstad.``But it can be done.'' Bush finished third in the state's caucusesin February, with Grassley backing the winner, Sen. Bob Dole, andBranstad professing neutrality.   As the long primary season was coming to a close, a candidatefrom the past _ former Democratic Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota_ announced his fourth try for the presidency. McCarthy, whose 1968candidacy was a rallying point for Americans opposed to the VietnamWar, said he was running on the Consumer Party ticket.   McCarthy, speaking to reporters and about 100 tourists nearIndependence Hall in Philadelphia, said he sees no real choicebetween the Democratic and Republican candidates.   Bush was at his oceanside home in Kennebunkport, Maine, where hehas been meeting with economists and other outside advisers for thepast several days.   The vice president looked on as Republican Rep. Bill Frenzel ofMinnesota, a supporter who is also a member of a bipartisandeficit-reduction commission, expressed skepticism over Bush'scampaign pledge to reject any tax-raising proposal the group mightcome up with.   ``That's what I think an election is about,'' Bush said. ``Thecommission can take an objective look and come up with whatever itwants. I'd be much more persuaded by what the American people say.''   Bush also took a swipe at Democrats, saying, ``All they want todo is tax and spend. There is no change I can see or hear out ofthat campaign that would lead you to believe anything other thanthat on the Democratic side.''   Former Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, who was amongthe advisers meeting with Bush on Wednesday, took a slap atDukakis' fiscal policies. The economic boom in Dukakis' state isfrequently referred to by the governor as the ``Massachusettsmiracle.'' Darman called it the ``Massachusetts mirage.''   Jackson spent much of his day in New Jersey before flying toCalifornia for the final few days of his primary candidacy. Hestepped over broken glass, plastic bottles, fast-food containersand other debris as he walked along a once-popular resort beach todramatize his call for environmental cleanup.   ``If the Russians were poisoning our air, if they were dumpingsludge in the water, if they were killing fish, we would call thatchemical warfare and we would negotiate tough,'' he said.   But campaign rhetoric aside, the final days of the Democraticprimary campaign were taking on the appearance of an elaboratepublic and private negotiation between Dukakis and Jackson over theparty's vice presidential candidate and national convention.   Jackson said Tuesday that he had earned consideration for thevice presidential nomination, and Dukakis said emphatically onWednesday that he agreed.   ``He's somebody who's done a remarkable job, has great gifts andgreat strengths,'' Dukakis said. ``I respect and admire him a lot.''   But asked if Jackson deserves special consideration to be on theticket, he said, ``No.''   Dukakis spent most of his day in Boston, where he called for thecreation of a new national student loan program that would ensurerepayment through payroll deductions.   ``We need a president who will end the annual assault on PellGrants and loans and programs for disadvantaged students,'' he said.   In other developments:   _ The Dukakis campaign said Dukakis' wife, Kitty, will undergotests at a Boston hospital to determine the cause of pain andnumbness she has been experiencing. A preliminary diagnosisindicated two herniated disks in the neck area.   _ Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk said Rep.William Gray of Pennsylvania has been named chairman of the party'splatform-drafting committee. Gray is chairman of the House BudgetCommittee.</TEXT></DOC>
