Paradoxically, the relatively small victory margin could help the president and his prime minister, Michel Rocard, reach out to centrist parties and politicians in forming the next government, as they repeatedly have said they wanted to do.    With 90% of the vote counted last night, computer projections from yesterday's first round of the parliamentary election had the Socialists and the coalition of the two main center-right parties neck and neck with just under 40% of the votes each. The Communists and the extreme right-wing National Front each got about 10% of the votes.    But projections of the distribution of seats in parliament after next Sunday's runoff round gave the Socialists and their allies between 310 and 330 seats, with 289 needed for a majority in the 577-member body. The center-right coalition would have about 250 seats, and the Communist Party around 10 seats. The National Front Party isn't expected to win a single seat.    In the last prior parliamentary election, held in 1986 under a system of proportional representation not used this time, the center-right parties and their allies had 296 seats, against 213 for the Socialists, 33 for the National Front and 35 for the Communists.    Given the uncertainty of yesterday's projections, some conservative politicians said it was still possible for their coalition to eke out a majority next Sunday, although Socialist leaders appeared confident they would win, and all the major polling firms agreed with the Socialists.    Early returns showed center-right candidates doing better than expected, and that could help Mr. Mitterrand &quot;open up&quot; French politics beyond its traditional rightleft cleavage.    Most centrists declined to join Mr. Rocard's interim government, formed just after Mr. Mitterrand's victory in the May 8 presidential election, but some might now be more willing to participate. Mr. Rocard and key cabinet members such as Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy are expected to retain their jobs, although some cabinet posts could now be given to non-Socialists.    Mr. Rocard said last night that next Sunday he wanted a &quot;stable&quot; majority in order to &quot;develop the effort of openness and national unity.&quot;    After a lackluster campaign, voting turnout was about 66% of those elegible, the lightest in the history of direct elections here. Political analysts were perplexed as to why so many voters stayed home, but some might be suffering from electoral fatigue, being asked to vote again so soon after giving Mr. Mitterrand a 54% majority.    Under the two-round parliamentary election system, candidates who got more than 12.5% of the votes in any district may stay in the race for next week's runoff vote. For most seats this will mean a direct contest between Socialists and candidates of the center-right coalition.    In some constituencies, particularly in and around Marseille, the extreme-right National Front candidates won enough votes to stay in the race if they wish, but none are given a good chance of winning.    Nationally, the National Front and the Communist Party each got about 10% of the votes, close to their totals in the 1986 election. National Front Party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen had won a surprising 14.4% of the votes in the first round of the presidential voting in April.    The parliamentary election is expected to have little or no impact on either French economic or foreign policy. Few issues emerged during the three-week campaign, and both major camps agree on a generally free-market economic approach.    The Socialists probably now will be able to proceed with their plan to freeze further direct privatization of French state companies, a policy begun by former conservative Prime Minister Jacques Chirac. But the Socialists also have said they plan to inject private capital, as much as 49% in some cases, in some nationalized companies. </TEXT></DOC>
