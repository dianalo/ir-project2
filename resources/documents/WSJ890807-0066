The board of UAL is to consider the proposal at a meeting sometime this week. Although the Davis proposal is said to be well over $200 a share, or $4.32 billion, the board hasn't disclosed it publicly.    The board's decision not to disclose the bid suggests that it falls well short of being a formal offer. However, it could trigger a battle for control of the nation's second-largest airline.    A spokesman for Mr. Davis wouldn't comment on the reports. In Chicago, a spokesman for UAL wouldn't comment either.    The overture from Mr. Davis comes at a difficult time for United, which just last month had its second fatal accident in six months when a DC-10 crash-landed in Sioux City, Iowa. Mr. Davis's move is also certain to rekindle the debate over whether airlines should be subject to leveraged buy-outs and the financial risk they entail.    Although Mr. Davis is a former oil wildcatter with a reported net worth of $1.6 billion, he has a track record of making lowball bids for companies that are then topped by others. Only last March, he made an opening $2.7 billion bid for NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, but was later outbid for the company in a two-round auction won by another Los Angeles investor, Alfred Checchi.    As it happened, it was Mr. Checchi's successful $3.65 billion bid for NWA that put the spotlight on the values of UAL and other U.S. airline companies. With 1988 revenue of $8.98 billion, United was recently surpassed as the largest U.S. airline by the American Airlines unit of AMR Corp.    UAL stock has soared from $117.50 a share a week before the Checchi-NWA pact was reached in mid-June to an intraday peak of $190 in late July. Much of the speculation was fueled by reports that investors such as Robert Bass and Mr. Davis had purchased stakes in UAL, and analysts have published estimates of its value as high as $300 a share, or $6.5 billion.    However, UAL stock has been faltering in the past week as the speculation lost momentum and a firm bid failed to emerge. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, UAL tumbled $9.50 a share to $164.50 amid reports that Mr. Checchi has been telling associates that the Transportation Department won't allow any more leveraged takeovers of major U.S. airlines. Mr. Checchi's bid included $3.3 billion of debt.    Mr. Davis's original 2.9% investment in NWA resulted from a study of the airline industry that suggested that a small group of airlines had emerged from deregulation whose results would be steadier, with less fare-cutting, than in the past decade.    With aircraft values soaring amid a scarcity of available planes, several analysts such as Paul Karos of First Boston Corp. have suggested that several airlines including UAL could be ripe for a round of leveraged buy-outs despite their pattern of cyclical profits that fluctuate with the economy.    The willingness of leveraged buy-out firms to consider buying airlines was underscored by the fact that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., the largest leveraged buyout firm, submitted a bid for NWA. People familiar with KKR say it would probably be interested in UAL as well. Another losing NWA bidder that might covet United is Pan Am Corp., which has said it needs a merger partner to survive.    Like NWA, United has a history of stormy labor relations and lacks a controlling stockholder or any other strong defense against a takeover. Unlike NWA, it has a well-regarded management team led by Chairman Stephen Wolf. One of its largest holders is Reliance Group Holdings Inc., whose chairman, Saul Steinberg, is no stranger to takeover activity.    Two years ago, UAL was put into play by its pilots union and a slew of corporate raiders. A campaign led by the New York investment firm of Coniston Partners forced the ouster of former Chairman Richard Ferris and the breakup of the travel conglomerate he had built with the sale of UAL's hotel and rental-car units.    The United pilots' union, which is working without a contract, has said it might revive its bid if UAL becomes a takeover target. However, it doesn't appear that Mr. Wolf would welcome the prospect of working for the pilots.    ---   Judith Valente contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
