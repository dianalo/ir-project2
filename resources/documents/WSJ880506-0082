Since 1986, those unable to watch could catch up by listening to radio broadcasts of &quot;The Cla'ence Update of ABC's All My Children.&quot; But ABC, after initially granting the radio show permission to air, now is suing to put a gag on Cla'ence and his 60-second radio broadcasts, which begin, &quot;Hey babysitters, it's the Cla'ence update . . .&quot;    ABC, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., filed suit yesterday in federal court in Manhattan against Bradley Sanders and his Babysitters Productions Inc.    The suit also names Los Angeles-based Premiere Radio Network, which distributes the satirical show to about 150 radio stations around the country. The suit alleges that despite an initial license granted in October 1986 and extended through August of that year, ABC subsequently asked the defendants to cease distributing the daily radio summaries of &quot;All My Children.&quot;    The suit also alleges that the companies distribute a second radio show, &quot;The Tyrone Update of ABC's All My Children,&quot; in Chicago, without ABC's permission.    Steve Lehman, president of Premiere, said, &quot;This is a ploy by ABC to pressure Premiere into giving up rights for the show so that ABC radio can pick up rights for the feature.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
