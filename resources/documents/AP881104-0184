(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker was not surprisedwhen prosecutors sent him a letter telling him he was the target ofa 15-month federal grand jury investigation into the televisionministry's finances, an attorney said Friday.   ``Obviously, when you're notified in writing, it's a cause ofconcern,'' Ryan Hovis said when asked for his client's response tothe Oct. 24 letter from federal prosecutor Charles Alexander.   ``This is not news to us, it's been known for the better part ofa year (that Bakker was a target),'' he said, adding it was not aforegone conclusion that he would be indicted.   The grand jury has been impaneled since August 1987 toinvestigate allegations of mail and wire fraud, conspiracy andcriminal tax violations.   Since that time, prosecutors have subpoenaed thousands ofdocuments to try to learn how Bakker operated the PTL and how he andhis aides spent millions of dollars in contributions from 1980-87.   Bakker resigned as PTL president in March 1987 in the midst of asex-and-money scandal.   Prosecutors are trying to determine whether Bakker and hisassociates raised money on television and through the mail for onepurpose and spent it on another. They also want to know whether anyof the money was used for personal benefit.   The Charlotte Observer reported Friday that PTL chief builder RoeMessner and Richard Dortch, Bakker's former top aide, also receivedletters informing them too were being investigated. Bakker, Messnerand Dortch were invited to appear before the 23-member grand jurylater this month. The letters said they were not compelled toappear, but if they did, their testimony could be used against them.   Hovis said he advised Bakker not to testify.   Alexander, who has repeatedly denied the existence of the grandjury investigation, was in Washington, D.C., on Friday, hissecretary said. He did not return phone calls.   Bakker also did not return phone calls Friday.   ``After careful review with my lawyers, I am respectfullydeclining the invitation to appear before the PTL grand jury,'' hesaid in an earlier statement.   In August, Bakker denied any wrongdoing and said he doubted hewould be indicted.   ``If I am, I'll be shocked,'' he said. ``If there is anindictment, it'll be because somebody framed us and set us up.''   Attorneys for Messner and Dortch did not return calls Fridayafternoon.</TEXT></DOC>
