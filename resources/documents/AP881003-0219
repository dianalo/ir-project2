ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Presidential candidates George Bush and Michael Dukakis hailedthe success of the Discovery space shuttle mission on Monday, whiletheir top campaign aides found a new sponsor for the second debateafter the League of Women Voters abruptly withdrew.   ``A great day for our country,'' proclaimed the Republican vicepresident, who was on hand at Edwards Air Force Base, California,to witness the landing of the shuttle. Bush was driven to within afew feet of the spacecraft and shook the hands of the five-membercrew as they emerged.   ``America is back in space,'' Democrat Dukakis told a rally inHartford, Conn. ``We are proud and we are thrilled at itsachievements and the courage of that crew.''   Meanwhile, both campaigns quickly found a sponsor to replace theleague.   Dukakis campaign Chairman Paul Brountas said he talked with BushChairman James A. Baker III by telephone and that they agreed toask the bipartisan commission that had sponsored the first debateto sponsor the second as well. The commission agreed and all wellgo ahead on schedule, Brountas said.   Bush campain spokesman Mark Goodin said as well that both sideshave agreed to a commission-sponsored debate no later than Oct. 14.He said the commission will have to decide on the location althoughit will try to hold the debate in Los Angeles, where it wasoriginally scheduled to be held Oct. 13 or Oct. 14.   The forum was scheduled to be held Oct. 13 or 14.   Janet Brown, executive director of the bipartisan commissionthat sponsored the first debate, said earlier Monday the panel hadreceived ``very positive messages'' from both campaigns that itwould be asked to take over sponsorship of the second forum.   The Dukakis campaign also disclosed it is running two moretelevision ads, part of series called, ``The Packaging of GeorgeBush.''   The new ads show men sitting around a table and discussing howto portray Bush as an environmentalist and how to deal withallegations of administration ties to Panamanian military leaderManuel Noriega.   Both ads end with a voice saying: ``They'd like to sell you apackage. Wouldn't you rather choose a president?''   Bush and Dukakis debated Sept. 25 in Winston-Salem, N.C., aconfrontation after which both sides said they were pleased withthe outcome and neutral observers found no clear winner.   The vice presidential candidates _ Republican Dan Quayle andDemocrat Lloyd Bentsen _ were off the campaign trail, preparing fortheir debate Wednesday night in Omaha, Neb.   Bentsen was doing his preparation in an Austin, Texas, hotel andduring a brief break he told reporters: ``I think we're relaxed forit; I think we're ready for it. ... I'm not nervous.''   The first presidential debate was sponsored by the Commission onPresidential Debates, a body co-chaired by Paul G. Kirk Jr. andFrank J. Fahrenkopf, the chairmen of the Democratic and Republicanparties, respectively.   The League, which was to sponsor the second presidential debate,abruptly withdrew from that role and president Nancy Neuman told aWashington news conference that ``we have no intention of becomingan accessory to the hoodwinking of the American people.''   Ms. Neuman said League officials objected to an agreementreached between the two campaigns which covered all details of thedebate.   ``The issue is who's in control of the debate,'' said Ms. Neuman.   The agreement between the two campaigns covered such details asthe makeup of the panel of questioners, the time the candidateswould have for responses, as well as where people would sit in thehall and whether the debaters would sit or stand.   The campaigns worked out similar details between themselves forthe first debate and proclaimed all parties pleased with thearrangement.   Brountas said he thought the debate commission was ``verypleased'' with the way the first debate went.   Tate said she thought most Americans would agree with thecampaigns on the issue of control over such details.   Campaigning in Connecticut, Dukakis said, ``Mr. Bush offerscomplacency; I offer change. He gives us slogans; We're offeringsolutions to the problems American families face every day andevery week and every month.''   He said he was offering solutions that were ``not big-moneysolutions or big-government solutions.''</TEXT></DOC>
