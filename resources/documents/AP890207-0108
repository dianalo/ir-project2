In a court filing, North lawyer Brendan Sullivan said the trialshould be stayed because ``the court refused to excuse numerousprospective jurors'' who indicated under questioning that they hadbeen exposed to North's 1987 immunized congressional testimony.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell did not act on the motionimmediately.   Those jurors who were questioned in open court first had statedin written questionnaires that they hadn't watched, listened to orread accounts of North's six days of testimony on Capitol Hill. Manywere accepted for the jury pool over the objection of North'slawyers.   North's lawyers said the court violated requirements of the JurySelection and Service Act of 1968.   Sullivan said ``the violation of'' the 1968 law ``can be remediedby excusing all prospective jurors'' who initially wrote on thequestionnaire that they hadn't been exposed to the North testimony,but indicated during open court questioning that they had been.   Prior to the filing by North's lawyers, the judge added fivepeople to the pool of prospective jurors, including a man who saidhe tried to put a pillow over his head to avoid hearing anythingabout the case.   The man, a supervisor for a security alarm company, said herecalls nothing about North's immunized congressional testimony in1987.   He said this morning when he woke up and knew he would be comingin for possible jury selection in the North case he ``heardsomething ... I tried to put the pillow over my head'' to keep fromlistening to a news broadcast about the case. North lawyer BarrySimon made no objection to the man's selection.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell has instructed allpotential jurors to avoid listening, reading or watching anythingabout the case.   The addition of two men and a woman built the size of the jurypool to 41, with 40 the minimum number necessary to pick a jury of12 with six alternates.   Gesell said he wants at least 44 to choose from, in case ofillness or other last-minute problems.   A District of Columbia health inspector also was sent into thejury pool after saying that he recalled seeing only ``little blips''of news broadcasts on North's congressional testimony. Simonobjected to his selection.   A retired key punch operator with eight children was qualified byGesell as a prospective juror after she said all she knew aboutNorth was that ``I think he flew a plane, something about Contraaid'' and that North was ``supposed to have delivered some goods''overseas ``in exchange for our hostages.'' She said ``I don't knowthat the mission was accomplished.'' She also said she saw ``littlebits and pieces'' on the evening news, which prompted an objectionfrom Simon to her selection.   Once the pool of prospective jurors is selected, the defense maychallenge 10 of them, the prosecution six and each side maychallenge three of the candidates for the alternate juror posts.   The selection process is in its sixth day in the search forprospective jurors who missed or didn't pay attention to North'snationally televised congressional testimony.   ``I expect to be able to put a jury into the box tomorrow,''Gesell said after selecting five women and one man Monday.   North is accused of shredding evidence and lying to Congress tocover up the Iran-Contra affair.   After Monday's jury selection proceedings, Gesell held aclosed-door hearing at the request of John Keker, head of the teamof three prosecutors, ``concerning his classified documentproblems,'' according to a notice issued by the judge.   The National Security Agency has objected to disclosure ofclassified information in North's trial and took its concerns to theJustice Department, government sources have said. But AttorneyGeneral Dick Thornburgh declined to step in on the NSA's behalf tohalt use of the information, said the sources, speaking on conditionof anonymity.   Last Thursday, Gesell granted intelligence agencies four seats inthe courtroom, but he warned that he wasn't going to let ``securitygurus'' run the North trial.   Gesell also denied a request from North's lawyers that the jurybe isolated for the duration of the trial, which could last up tofive months, according to estimates made in the middle of lastmonth. The judge gave no reason for denying the motion.   North faces 12 criminal charges carrying a maximum of 60 years inprison and $3 million in fines if he is convicted on all counts. Heis accused of allegedly concealing from Congress in 1985 and 1986his efforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras and of covering upfrom the attorney general the National Security Council's role indiverting money from the Reagan administration's Iran arms sales tothe Contras.   North also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 securitysystem at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord, converting tohis own use at least $4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leaderAdolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenuein connection with charitable contributions supporting the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
