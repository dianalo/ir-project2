One proposal for solving the problem is that the legislaturemight restrict judicial control to watching over the principle of justifiability,and there are other suggestions discussed that seek solutions in thefield of procedural law, or substantive law. Other aspects discussedinclude a curtailment of the scope of discretion of authorities, or oflocal governments. As for years now there hasn't been any nuclear powerplant that could start operation on the basis of uncontested licences,the administrative legal protection in this field seems to be disfunctional.The courts themselves can contribute a lot to preventing disfunctionality,but the legislature is mainly responsible for this development, and shouldbe the first to counteract.
