Anderson Distinguished Achievement Award,given to the original Macintosh development team, and the DerekVan Alstyne Rising Star Award, given to Raymond Lau.andP;  Lau is thesole author of Stufflt, a data compression program.andP;  Anderson andVan Alstyne were two MacUser editors who were killed during theOct 17, 1989 California earthquake.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Product:   Apple Macintosh (Microcomputer) (equipment and supplies)Type Manager (Printer software) (achievements and awards)Articulate Systems Voice Navigator (Input-output device)(achievements and awards)Freedom of the Press Professional (Printer software) (achievementsand awards)Apple Macintosh Portable (Portable computer) (achievements andawards).andO;Topic:     Computer industryAchievements and AwardsText EditorsDirectories.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>EDITORS' CHOICE AWARDSandM;The year 1989 saw the introduction and maturation of some exciting productsand technologies.andP;  The appearance of the Macintosh Portable, along with a newline of faster Macs, would be exciting enough in a duller year to raiseanyone's hear rate, but we also saw the announcement of System 7, the rolloutof revolutionary products such as Adobe Type Manager (ATM) and Freedom ofPress, intelligent interfaces and voice recognition, sophisticatedcalibration techniques, 32-bit QuickDraw, higher standards for DTP,continuous-tone thermal printing -- and the list goes on and on.andP;  With allthese introductions and changes, how do you decide which products are thevery best?andM;Every year, the entire editorial staff of MacUser goes through a grueling butexciting process: We survey the expanding Macintosh universe (no mean feat),come up with a long list of nominees in 40 categories, hold them up against ayear's worth of lab tests, and vote for the top products of the year.andP;  Theresult is the select group of products that are known as Eddy Award winners.andM;We also honor the best new technology of the year, the most-significanthardware and software products (trendsetters that set the stage for thefuture), and the best overall hardware and software products of the year.andM;The Eddies help you assess the Mac universe, but you don't get great productswithout great people.andP;  This is why we're introducing two new categories thisyear, the John J. Anderson Distinguished Achievement Award and the Derek VanAlstyne Rising Star Award, named in honor of the two MacUser editors who diedtragically during the California earthquake of October 17, 1989.andP;  With theseawards, we honor the human face in the interface, which is, after all, theprime engine that moves the Macintosh world.andM;HARDWARE PRODUCTandM;OF THE YEARandM;Macintosh PortableandM;The Macintosh Portable was quite an engineering achievement, squeezing a100-percent Mac into a briefcase-sized package assembled like a jigsawpuzzle, without screws.andM;HONORABLE MENTIONSandM;The Microtek MSF-300Z is an affordable high-resolution full-color andgray-scale scanner that's bundled with some of the best photo-retouchingsoftware for the Mac.andP;  The SuperMac ColorCard/24 sports hardware panning andzoom, a virtual desktop in lower-bit modes, and accelerator-readiness.andM;SOFTWARE PRODUCTandM;OF THE YEARandM;Freedom of PressandM;Freedom of Press from Custom Application International has earned this Eddyby giving the full power of PostScript to a wide variety of output devices.andO;This software brings high-quality imaging to more users than ever before.andO;Makers of output peripherals can applaud this product for expanding theirpotential market into the Mac community.andM;HONORABLE MENTIONSandM;Adobe Type Manager's font-display and printing talents have raised thestandards for what the Mac can do with type.andP;  MacroMind Director, with itsseasoned animation powers and farreaching importation of graphics and sound,has helped make the Mac a true multimedia machine.andM;BEST NEWandM;TECHNOLOGYandM;32-Bit QuickDrawandM;A year ago, when developers were asked what they were doing with color,they'd reply, &quot;We're waiting for Apple to release its standard for 32-bitcolor.&quot;andP;  The standard is now here and the variety of peripherals and softwarethat support this standard is growing daily.andM;HONORABLE MENTIONSandM;Continuous-tone thermal printing is the first printing technology to offerthe promise of true high-resolution color printed output at a reasonablecost.andP;  ICI, Kodak, and dai-Nippon have already produced technology that canprint at near-photographic quality.andP;  Erasable optical technology burst ontothe scene last year, putting the mass into mass storage with 1-giga-byteremovable discs, with replacement cartridges costing less than 30 cents permegabyte, thanks to the original manufacturers of the optical assemblies,Sony, Ricoh, and Maxtor.andM;MOST SIGNIFICANTandM;HARDWARE PRODUCTandM;Voice NavigatorandM;When we first saw a prerelease version of Articulate Systems'speech-recognition system, voice Navigator, we expected it to be a crude andbuggy experiment.andP;  We were amazed.andP;  Even then, it ran smoothly andeffectively.andP;  As we watched it evolve, one thing became clear: Speechrecognition is a vitally important computer technology.andP;  Voice Navigator'sexpansion of the interface beyond the keyboard, mouse, and screen is a majorstep toward computing with a human face.andM;HONORABLE MENTIONSandM;Color accuracy is a major concern in electronic publishing, and the BarcoCalibrator monitor (also marketed by RasterOps as the Color-Board 742Calibrator System) provides superior results.andP;  Honorable mention also goes tothe Mitsubishi S340-10 dye thermal-transfer printer, the first to bringcontinuoustone color images to the Mac desk-top.andM;THE DEREK VAN ALSTYNEandM;RISING STAR AWARDandM;Raymond LauandM;If the John J. Anderson Distinguished Achievement Award takes a long lookbackward to recognize enduring contributions, the Derek Van Alstyne RisingStar Award is an attempt to predict the future.andP;  Derek was a rising star -- abrilliant, dedicated programmer with a vision of the bright future thatpersonal computer can bring.andP;  This year's recipient, Raymond Lau, alsoembodies these characteristics.andM;Ray Lau is a programmer in the Derek Van Alstyne mold: tireless andbrilliant, with vision and the courage to try his wings.andP;  Many Mac users havedownloaded files from an information service such as CompuServe andencountered Ray Lau's brilliance.andP;  Ray is the sole author of Stufflt.andM;Stufflt, a data-compression program that can be used to speed datatransmission over phone lines or to squeeze more data onto a floppy disk,would be an impressive program if it had been a commercial product developedby a team of professional developers with years of programming experience.andO;It was, in fact, a shareware program written by a 15-year-old.andP;  With Stufflt,Ray did something that many major software vendors have failed to do: Hesingle-handedly established a standard data format for an application area.andO;This fall, Ray's accomplishment began to pay off as Aladdin Systems starteddistributing a commercial version of stufflt.andM;Raymond Lau; a rising star in the Macintosh firmament.andM;MOST SIGNIFICANTandM;SOFTWARE PRODUCTandM;Adobe Type ManagerandM;Adobe Type Manager elegantly moves us one step closer to the WYSIWYG ideal.andO;It works with existing applications to provide smooth screen display of Type-1 PostScript fonts in any size and greatly improves the printed quality oflarge type on non-PostScript printers.andP;  It's a significant aid forprofessional and amateurs alike.andM;HONORABLE MENTIONSandM;Freedom of Press, from Custom Applications International, is software thatbrings PostScript-printing capability to non-PostScript output devices, frominexpensive ink-jet printers to high-quality film recorders.andP;  And Vellum fromAshlar redefines the aided in computer-aided design, pointing in a newdirection for intelligent interfaces.andM;THE JOHN J.
