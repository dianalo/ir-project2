That's certainly been the expectation over the past year,as hordes of investors have fled 4% certificates of depositand money-market funds for various types of bonds and bondfunds boasting yields of 6.5% to 8% and even more.   But &quot;yields&quot; and &quot;returns&quot; are two different things, andinvestors who blindly chase higher yields can end upregretting it. So far this year, losses on many bondinvestments have been teaching individuals what sophisticatedinstitutions have known for decades: Yield is often a poorproxy for total return, and confusing the two can be verydamaging to your wealth.   &quot;Total return is much more consequential than yield&quot;because it's ultimately what determines future wealth, saysHugh Lamle, executive vice president at M.D. Sass InvestorsServices Inc. &quot;Institutions have long recognized this -- theybuy bonds not with the view that they'll hold them 10 or 20years, but that they're buying an investment like any other,which ultimately might be sold.&quot;   &quot;Total return&quot; for fixed-income investments comprises notjust the initial yield, but also interest on reinvestedinterest, and price change. Only in the case of short-terminvestments, such as one-year CDs or Treasury bills, is yielda good gauge of total return.   For long-term bonds, and bonds purchased at prices farabove or below face value, other factors will often dwarfyield in determining total returns. That's true even when thebonds are of triple-A credit quality and are &quot;non-callable,&quot;which means they can't be redeemed by the issuer beforematurity.   For instance, interest on interest easily becomes thebiggest factor in returns for buy-and-hold investors inlong-term bonds, especially if interest rates rise during thelife of the bond. If you bought a 30-year Treasury bondyielding 7.9% today, and interest rates subsequently rose sothat your average reinvestment rate was 9% over the life ofthe bond, almost 80% of your total return at maturity wouldcome from income on reinvested interest, according to G.A.T.Integrated Financial Services, a fixed-income research firm.   At a 6% reinvestment rate, meanwhile, interest-on-intereston that 30-year Treasury would still represent abouttwo-thirds of its total return -- and even at a tiny 3% rate,40% of total return.   While interest on interest dominates bond returns for longholding periods, price change dominates total return forshort-term investors. In either case, future interest-ratechanges are the major concern for investors who want tosafeguard their total returns.   Whether they realize it or not, most individuals whoinvest in bond mutual funds are effectively short-term bondholders even if they stay invested in the fund for a longtime. The reason is that a bond fund doesn't buy and holdbonds to maturity, but instead actively trades them -- andthe value of the fund's shares directly reflects the dailyprice swings of bonds in its portfolio.   Depending on what happens to prices by the time abond-fund investor cashes out, the investor will end up withprice gains or losses on their holdings. As a result, pricechange becomes an important part of their total return.   As a rule, a bond's price moves inversely to prevailinginterest rates in bond market: In the above example, a 7.9%coupon on a 30-year bond would be a boon to total returns ifrates fell to 3%, so holders of those bonds would find itsilly to sell unless they were compensated for their valuablecoupons. That would only happen when prices on their bondsrose enough to push yields close to the prevailing 3% level.The reverse would hold if interest rates went up, instead ofdown.   The starting yield becomes a bigger boon or burden toinvestors the longer the bond's maturity -- which makes totalreturns on longer-term bonds much more sensitive to interestrate swings.   For instance, in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, long-termTreasury bonds actually had lower total returns thanmoney-market funds, despite their persistently higher yields.Average yields on long-term Treasury bonds were roughly 2.9%in the 1950s, 4.6% in the 1960s and 7.4% in the 1970s --compared with 1.9%, 3.9% and 6.3% for Treasury bills (thestaple investment held by money funds) in the same threedecades, according to Ibbotson Associates Inc., a Chicagoresearch firm.   But steadily rising interest rates erased an average of2.5% a year from the value of long-term bond portfolios inthe 1950-80 period -- more than wiping out the bonds' yieldadvantage over T-bills. As a result, a $1,000 investment in along-term Treasury fund would have grown to only $2,097 afterthe 30 years ending Dec. 31, 1979, compared with $3,243 for alike investment in a super-safe T-bill portfolio, the datashow.   In the 1980s, by contrast, a steady decline in interestrates meant long-term bonds put on a much better showing thantheir yields would have indicated. While the average 10.4%yield on long-term Treasurys was only 1.43 percentage pointsbetter than the average T-bill yield during the decade,rising bond prices pushed total returns on Treasurys up to anaverage of 12.6% a year-beating T-bill returns by a generous3.7-percentage-point margin. And in 1991, long-term Treasurybonds racked up total returns of 19.3% -- beating T-bills bya stunning 13.7 percentage points, Ibbotson says.   Of course, no one really knows where interest rates willgo, or when, from here -- and trying to predict them hasproved a fruitless exercise, even for professionals. Butinvestors can get a handle on the risks they face in theshort run by considering how total returns on differentinvestments would react to interest rate changes over, say,the next 12 months.   If interest rates were to fall one percentage point fromthe current level, for instance, the typical mutual fundspecializing in long-term bonds (maturing in more than 10years) would generate an estimated total return of about 13%over the coming year. But if interest rates were to rise byone percentage point over the course of the year, the totalreturn would shrink to about 1% -- making a 4% moneyfundreturn look good by comparison.   Looking at the problem a different way tells investors howmuch rates would have to rise before total returns on bondfunds were reduced to money-fund returns. For instance, overthe next year, interest rates would have to rise 1.25percentage points to reduce the return on short-term bondfunds (which buy bonds with one-to-five-year maturities) tothe level of money-fund returns. But with intermediate-termfunds (of five to 10 year maturities), rates would have toclimb only 0.75 percentage point; and for long-term funds,only half a point before an investor would be just as welloff sticking with money funds.   Half a percentage point &quot;isn't very much in this market --you could get that in a couple of quarters, easy,&quot; says JackAblin, a senior fund manager at the Private Bank, the trustand investments division of the Bank of Boston.</TEXT></DOC>
