<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-20-0986 </DOCNO><TEXT>After some ten years of development the test program carried out withthe ADAMO and KRETA facilities for cryogenic separation of Krypton fromthe dissolver offgas of a reprocessing plant was brought to an end ina continuous campaign of three months of industry-like operation. Thefeasibility of the chosen concept has been demonstrated in some 20,000hours of test operation. The most important activity was the investigation,in cryogenic columns of the behavior of impurities within the offgasstream (O{sub 2}, CO{sub 2}, CH{sub 4}, NO/sub x/) and of compounds whichmay form in the columns (O{sub 3}, N{sub 2}O{sub 4}) due to radiolysis.Progress was made in the following areas: (1) effective removal of NO/subx/ in the preparatory catalytic reduction step; NO/sub x/ can be removedfrom the process gas down to less than 1 ppm/sub v/, which prevents pluggingof the cryogenic column; and (2) effective removal of ozone togetherwith the xenon bottom product from the krypton-xenon separation column.Operating the column with continuous head and bottom product withdrawal,and suppressing pressure oscillations by careful control, allows theXe-O{sub 3} product to be kept free from krypton down to a few ppm/subv/. Another topic of development was the reduction of the krypton inventoryof the columns to reduce the activity inventory. In three months of continuousoperation no major malfunctions occurred. No long-term effects, suchas dangerous accumulations or gradual plugging of parts of the installations,were observed.</TEXT></DOC>
