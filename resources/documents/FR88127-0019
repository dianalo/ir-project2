Russell (202) 366-2184. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Requests </ITAG>The FHWA proposes to act on the requests for change to the MUTCD as notedbelow: General Provisions (Part I) (1) <T3>Request I-8(C)</T3>_<T3>Responsibility for Maintaining Traffic Control Devices. </T3>The NationalTransportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated an accident where trafficcontrol devices had been removed by an agent of a highway agency. The missingtraffic control devices may have had a direct bearing on the cause of theaccident and on the severity of the accident. The NTSB has requested thatresponsibility for maintaining traffic control devices be clarified inthe MUTCD. The FHWA proposed to amend the first sentence of Section 1A-3 to read.``The responsibility for the installation, operation and effective maintenanceof traffic control devices rests with the governmental body or officialhaving jurisdiction.'' The amendment imposes no additional costs on highway agencies, therefore,no implementation period is proposed. Signs (Part II) (2) <T3>Request II-119(C)</T3>_<T3>Standard Sign to Implement Mandatory Seat Belt Laws. </T3>The NationalAssociation of Governor's Highway Safety Representatives has requestedthat a standard sign be developed and adopted for use by States havingmandatory safety seat belt laws. Because of the variations that exist amongthe seat belt laws of the several States, it is not possible to adopt astandard sign. However, it does appear to be practical to develop and adopta standard symbol that can be used on regulatory signs that notify vehicleoccupants of mandatory seat belt laws. The FHWA and the Symbols Task Force of the National Committee on UniformTraffic Control Devices (NCUTCD) have reviewed and evaluated many existingand proposed symbol designs. The symbol shown below has emerged as themost favored at this time. Therefore, the FHWA is proposing to amend theMUTCD to require that the standard symbol be used, if a State determinesthat a seat belt symbol is to be shown on the regulatory signs that implementits mandatory safety seat belt laws. The FHWA is also soliciting commentson both the concept of using a standard symbol for this purpose and onthe details of the proposed symbol. The FHWA plans to use the commentsreceived regarding the details of the proposed symbol to guide its finaldesign. <G/><ITAG tagnum="91">Insert Illus. 750 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"> </ITAG>This amendment may have some financial impact in those States that havealready installed signs for mandatory safety seat belt laws. To offsetthese costs, an implementation period of 7 years (the average life of asign) is proposed. (3) <T3>Request II-161(C)</T3>_<T3>LOGO Signing</T3>_<T3>Number of LOGO's on Sign Panels. </T3>The rules and regulations forSpecific Service (LOGO) Signing were transferred from 23 CFR Part 655,Subpart C and incorporated into the MUTCD by Final Rule, FHWA Docket No.83-26 (50 FR 10001, March 13, 1985). There are now over 30 States usingLOGO signs on some or all of their rural freeway systems. Since the initialinstallations of LOGO signs in 1968, the number of LOGOs on a sign panelhas been limited to six for GAS and four each for FOOD, LODGING, and CAMPING.More than 30 States now have experience with LOGOs and LOGO programs. TheFHWA proposes to allow each State to determine the maximum number of logosthat it will permit for each of the LOGO panel categories. In addition,this amendment will allow the background of the LOGO to be other than blue,at each State's discretion; the paragraph discussing LOGO signing on rampswill be clarified; and several minor editorial changes will be made. Because changes to existing or future LOGO signing with regard to the numberof LOGOs that will be used on each panel will be at the State's discretion,no implementation period is necessary. Markings (Part III) (4) <T3>Request III-35(C)</T3>_<T3>Warrants for Centerline Pavement Markings. </T3>The Center for AutoSafety (CAS) has petitioned the FHWA to initiate rulemaking to establishwarrants for centerline pavement markings. A review and evaluation of theFHWA research and development program to improve the effectiveness of highwaydelineation techniques was conducted by Messrs. Richard N. Schwab and DonaldG. Capelle. Their conclusions were reported in the June 1980 issue of theInstitute of Transportation Engineers Journal. Their conclusions are: (1) Centerline markings can be cost beneficial ataverage daily traffic volumes (ADT) as low as 50 vehicles and (2) centerlinesshould be used on any paved roadway surface that will retain pavement markingsand that carries two-way traffic. The FHWA proposes to amend the fifth paragraph of Section 3B-1 to readas follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">Center lines shall be placed on all paved roadway surfaces that willretain pavement markings under the following conditions: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. In rural districts on all two-way roadways 18 feet or more in widthwhen the prevailing off-peak 85 percentile speed or posted speed limit,whichever is higher, is 35 MPH or greater.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. In residence or business districts on all through highways withan ADT of 50 or greater, and on other streets where the ADT is 500 or greater.</ITAG>This amendment will impose some costs on State and local highway agencies.To offset these costs, an implementation period of 5 years is proposed.(5) <T3>Request III-48(C)_Lane Lines in Cloverleaf Interchanges.</T3> Mr. RichardI. Kahl has pointed out a need to illustrate the desirable pavement markingpattern to be used to separate the mainline from a cloverleaf's combinedacceleration/deceleration lane. The FHWA proposes to add a figure to section3B-11 that will show the typical installation of these pavement markings.There are many tasks to be accomplished by the drivers in the weaving sectionbetween cloverleaf ramps. Defining the lane line throughout the entirelength of the combined acceleration/deceleration lane, with standard skipstripe markings, is desirable so that drivers can better determine theirlateral position.It is possible to design a more complex set of coded pavement markingsto inform the drivers of their longitudinal position within the weavingarea. Because of the high degree of pavement marking wear that occurs inweaving areas, the FHWA finds that it is not practical to attempt to maintainsuch a system in the field.This amendment adds a figure that clarifies a provision of the MUTCD. Noimplementation period is needed.Signals (Part IV)(6) <T3>Request IV-85(C)_Revision to Warrant 7, Systems Warrant. </T3>The SystemsWarrant (existing Warrant 7) is intended to provide for signalization ofplanned major routes in order to encourage concentration and organizationof traffic flow networks. Typically, it is used in intermediate or outlyingareas of developing density but may also have application elsewhere inan urban area. Selected traffic signal installations can permit desirablelocation of traffic signals, reduce the total number of signals and improveprogression within the highway (street) system.The NCUTCD reviewed the warrant and recommended several revisions to remedyminor deficiencies and to make the warrant more realistic for today's trafficcharacteristics while still meeting the original intent:1. Increase the required volume of existing or immediately projected trafficentering the intersection to be 1,000 vehicles (now 800) during the peakhour of a typical weekday or for each of any 5 hours of a Saturday and/orSunday.2. Relative to application of the peak hour criteria, that for 5 year projectedtraffic volumes based on an engineering study, one or more of the volumebased warrants would be met.3. The existing version of the warrant lists five characteristics of amajor route and stipulates that a route, to be considered major in applyingthe warrant, must have one or more of these characteristics. It is recommendedthat characteristic (2) (It connects areas of principal traffic generation.)be deleted as it is subject to varying definitions and it is already coveredin the other characteristics. It is also recommended that characteristic(4) (It has surface street freeway or expressway ramp terminals.) be deletedas it is covered in the other characteristics. The FHWA proposes to amendSection 4C-9 (Warrant 7, Systems Warrant) to provide for these changes.The proposed amendment will provide a more realistic warrant and does notimpose additional costs on State and local highway agencies. No compliancedate is needed to implement this change.Traffic Control Systems for Street and Highway Construction and MaintenanceOperations (Part VI)(7) <T3>Request VI-56(C)_Work Zone Lane Shift Tapers.</T3> The NCUTCD has requestedthat Part VI of the MUTCD be amended by adding length standards for workzone lane shift tapers. Most manuals and other publications do not differentiatebetween the length of taper required for different taper applications.Often the same taper length is recommended for a merge application andfor a lane shift application. The NCUTCD also found that there is no standarduse of terms for describing the various taper applications.The FHWA proposes to adopt the recommendations of the NCUTCD. Section 6C-2will be separated into two separate sections. The first will address thelength of tapers and will include the following table. The second sectionwill include the channelization issues that are currently presented insection 6C-2.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table VI-</T4>2_<T4>Taper Length Criteria for Work Zones </T4><H1>Type of taper </H1><H1>Taper length </H1> Upstream tapers: <ITAG tagnum="1">Merging taper <D>L minimum. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Shifting taper <D/>\1/2\ L minimum. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Shoulder taper <D/>\1/3\ L minimum. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Two-way traffic taper <D>100 feet maximum. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Downstream tapers (Use is optional) <D>100 feet minimum. </D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>Formulas for L </T2><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Speed limit <D/>Formula<R>sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">40 MPH or less <D>L=(Wandmultiply;Sandmultiply;S)andCx.1;60. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">45 MPH or greater <D>L=Wandmultiply;S. </D><F>L=Taper length in feet. </F><F>W=Width of offset in feet. </F><F>S=Posted speed or off-peak 85 percentile speed in MPH. </F></ITAG></ITAG>In addition, Figures 6-5, 6-6, and 6-7 will be revised to reflect the abovechanges. The amendment will impose some additional costs on State and local highwayagencies, therefore, an implementation period of 1 year is proposed. (8) <T3>Request VI-57(C)_Temporary Pavement Markings in Construction and MaintenanceAreas.</T3> Request VI-3 as published in the MUTCD implemented requirementsfor minimum pavement marking treatments for traffic control in work zones.That revision provided for minimum stripe to gap ratios, allowed raisedpavement markers, and other changes. It is proposed to further amend section 6D to clarify and provide furtherguidance. Section 6D-1 is being revised to provide further guidance forthe use of permanent pavement markings in accordance with sections 3B,7C, 8B-4, and 9C on any permanent pavement surfaces and final lifts aswell as on temporary pavements, detours, runarounds, or interim lifts opento traffic and when the project work is suspended for the winter or otherextended periods of time. Section 6D-3 Exception Number 1 is being revised to further describe temporarylanes and center lines. Also, the provisions for the use of signs ratherthan pavement markings in short-term operations is being expanded to applyto low-volume roadways. Section 6D-3 is being further revised to include a recommendation thateach highway agency should have a policy that will, within the scope ofthis section, provide more detailed criteria and describe the conditionswhere temporary pavement markings will be used. This policy should include,but not be limited to, criteria, definitions of extended periods of timeand a traffic volume threshold for low-volume roads. The changes are being made to clarify the amendments made by the FinalRule on March 9, 1987, at 52 FR 7126, provide more guidance for pavementmarkings on permanent pavement surfaces and interim or temporary pavementsopen to traffic for extended periods of time, and allow flexibility forthe use of signs rather than pavement marking for low volume roads. It is the policy of the FHWA that full standards for pavement markingsare desirable for all pavements and the minimums should be used when fullstandards are not practical or possible. The Final Rule on March 9, 1987, at 52 FR 7126, has a compliance date ofDecember 31, 1988. This amendment adds some flexibility to the provisionsadopted in the March 9, 1987, Final Rule. Therefore, the same compliancedate of December 31, 1988 is proposed for this amendment. (9) <T3>Request VI-59(C)_Section 6G-6, Control of Traffic. </T3>The NCUTCDhas requested that the sentence, ``The use of traffic control signs shouldbe discouraged.'' be deleted from the first paragraph of MUTCD section6G-6. The NCUTCD requests this change because the sentence is potentiallymisleading. While the objective on freeways is to keep traffic in a free-flowingcondition as much as possible, this sentence, taken out of context, canbe easily misinterpreted and is misleading to those responsible for trafficcontrol on freeways. The statement has little value in this section. The FHWA supports this amendment. This amendment will impose no additionalcosts on highway agencies, therefore, it is proposed that the change wouldbecome effective upon the issuance of a final rule. No implementation periodis required.(10) <T3>Request VI-60(C)_Color and Design of Work Zone Vests. </T3>Section6F-3 of the MUTCD includes the following provision: ``The use of orangeclothing such as a vest, shirt, or jacket shall be required for flaggers.For nighttime conditions, similar outside garments shall be reflectorized.''The MUTCD does not include provisions that would describe or provide detailson the color, design, or extent of the retroreflection. The FHWA has interpretedsection 6F-3 to mean that only orange colored retroreflective materialwill satisfy the standard. In practice, vests have had a variety of designs,patterns, and colors for the retroreflective portion of the vests. Accordingly,it is proposed to amend section 6F-3 by adding two sentences to the endof the second paragraph to read as follows: ``The retroreflective materialshall be either orange, white, or yellow. The design of the retroreflectiveportions including stripe width, extent, design and type of material shallbe determined by the contracting agency, or purchaser of the vest.''The term ``reflection'' as used throughout Section 6F-3 will be changedto ``retroreflection.''This amendment will have no financial impact on State and local agencies.No implementation period is needed.This notice of proposed amendments to the MUTCD is issued under the authorityof 23 U.S.C. 109(d), 315, and 402(a), and the delegation of authority in49 CFR 1.48(b).The FHWA has determined that this document contains neither a major ruleunder Executive Order 12291 nor a significant proposal under the regulatorypolicies and procedures of the Department of Transportation. For the reasonsstated herein and under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act,it is certified that this action will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. Due to the preliminary natureof the inquiry, a regulatory evaluation has not been prepared at this time.The expected impact of the changes requested is so minimal that a fullregulatory evaluation does not appear to be warranted. The need to furtherevaluate economic consequences will be reviewed on the basis of the commentssubmitted in response to this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 23 CFR Part 655</ITAG>Design standards, Grant programs-transportation, Highways and roads, Signs,Traffic regulations, Incorporation by reference.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.205, HighwayPlanning and Construction.
