He had a steady job, equityin the house and little debt, but they turned him down.   In desperation, he arranged a $35,000, two-year loan froma small Massachusetts mortgage lender, Resource Equity Inc.,at a stratospheric 34.09% interest rate. When Resourcewouldn't refinance Mr. Saunders's loan he fell even deeperinto debt through refinancings with other high-rate lenders.Now the 42-year-old city employee, his wife and threedaughters face eviction from their home of 16 years by athird lender.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This might never have happened if we'd been able to finda bank loan in the first place,&quot; Mr. Saunders says. The banksdecline to address specifics of his case, but judging byrecent studies of lending patterns, one reason he couldn'tget bank loans may have had to do with his address: He livesin a low-income, mostly black Boston neighborhood with fewbank branches. A big survey by the Federal Reserve andanalyses by others show these areas get a disproportionatelysmall share of mortgage money from banks.   Yet many of the same banks that treat such low-incomeresidents as bad risks have often found a way to get some oftheir business anyway. They have often financed hard-sell,high-rate home-equity lenders who solicit inner-cityborrowers. Resource, Mr. Saunders's lender, gotmultimillion-dollar credit lines at several banks, includingShawmut and Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc., New England'slargest bank.   The Resource companies, which operated under variousnames, have stopped lending and are in federal bankruptcyproceedings. Their owner, Brent Lambert of Hingham, Mass.,didn't return calls seeking comment. His attorney, BrackettDeniston, says the companies &quot;provided loans to many peoplewho had nowhere else to turn&quot; and always did business &quot;in ascrupulously honest and ethical manner.&quot;   Foreclosure and eviction are nothing new in mortgagelending. Nor are firms making risky loans to desperate peopleat stiff rates. But the plight of the Saunders family, and ofthousands like them, reveals the behind-the-scenes role ofsome major banks. Besides lines of credit to high-interestlenders, this bank role includes purchasing the high-ratelenders' notes on the secondary market.   Such ties are likely to become a growing embarrassment forbanks across the country as their commitment to communitylending comes under scrutiny as a result of the sweepingFederal Reserve survey, which is to be announced today. It isexpected to show that minorities are two to four times morelikely than whites at similar income levels to be rejectedfor bank mortgages.   Attorneys and neighborhood-housing advocates say thehigh-rate lenders step into this credit vacuum and targetlow-income and elderly homeowners in neighborhoods poorlyserved by mainstream banks. &quot;The mortgage hustlers can writemortgages at 18% or 22% because the banks aren't out therelending at 10% or 12%. But it's usually bank money anyway,&quot;says Andrew Fischer, a Boston attorney who successfully sueda high-rate lender last year.   These firms operate on the fringe of the legitimatesecond-mortgage business, which involves some $300 billion ofloans. But most of them couldn't survive without backing frombanks and access to the secondary mortgage market, where theysell the high-yielding notes to mainstream banks. And criticssay the banks often buy the lucrative paper without applyingstandards they require of their own loans.   Citibank says it made that mistake with Dartmouth PlanInc., a high-rate finance company that went out of businesslast year after selling more than 1,000 notes to Citibank. ACitibank spokesman says that although such consumer-financenotes can be highly profitable, &quot;as soon as we found out thatthe loans had been misrepresented to consumers and to us, wesevered our ties to the company.&quot; Citibank, whose parentCiticorp also lent money to Dartmouth, faces outlays of morethan $1 million in restitution and payments in order tosettle suits against the finance firm, which was based inGarden City, N.Y.   &quot;We weren't the loan originators, but since we ultimatelyheld the paper, we felt we had to make them right,&quot; Citibanksays.   Elizabeth Bradford, an assistant attorney general in NewYork, calls Dartmouth &quot;one of the worst.&quot; But she says mostof the high-rate firms flout lending laws. Consumers, shesays, often &quot;just don't realize they've put their homes injeopardy until it's too late.&quot;   And banks, in turn, &quot;don't want to look under the covers&quot;when they buy high-rate mortgages, charges Rep. Joseph P.Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat and member of the HouseBanking Committee. He adds that &quot;the way to stop these scamsis to get legitimate bankers back in the neighborhoods.&quot;   Second-mortgage firms are under the spotlight nationwide.The Justice Department recently began an investigation ofpossible civil-rights and other violations by banks andhigh-rate lenders. State attorneys general in Massachusetts,New York and Connecticut also are investigating high-ratelenders and home-improvement firms that often act as theiragents in initiating loans.   A spate of lawsuits in Chicago, Los Angeles, Atlanta andelsewhere has led to judgments against high-rate lenders and,in some cases, their bankers. In Illinois, Community Bank ofGreater Peoria last year settled a class-action suit, infederal court in Chicago, involving more than 6,275 high-ratehome-improvement loans. The most recent case was a $45million verdict in state court in Clayton, Ala., againstUnion Mortgage Co. awarded to five Alabama families who losttheir homes. A lawyer for Union, which is based in Dallas butowned by Skopbank of Helsinki, Finland, says Union hasappealed the award, which he calls &quot;grossly in excess of anydamages.&quot;   In Boston, where the problems are typical of those inother cities, bankers acknowledge past neglect and say theynow are reaching out to low-income and minorityneighborhoods. Over the years, &quot;a whole class of people havebeen denied credit because of their address,&quot; says GailSnowden, president of Boston First, a 10-branch Bank ofBoston subsidiary serving low- and moderate-income areas. Shesays some banks have only reluctantly embraced the CommunityReinvestment Act, which requires banks to meet the creditneeds of their cities, including low-income areas. &quot;Bankersshould see neighborhood lending not as compliance butopportunity,&quot; she says.   Some banks are now cutting their ties to high-ratelenders. A spokesman for Shawmut, a unit of Shawmut NationalCorp., says the bank has phased out most indirect lendingthrough second-mortgage companies. He says the bank now has anumber of programs designed to serve low-incomeneighborhoods.   Fleet has stopped doing business with 38 lenders that itsays didn't meet its standards. &quot;There were clearly abuses,outrageous practices that tug at the heartstrings,&quot; saysFleet's chairman, J. Terrence Murray. Although Fleet had onlya small share of high-rate mortgages in the Boston area, itset up an $11 million fund to refinance 550 &quot;burdensome&quot;mortgages in Boston. Most were inherited from Bank of NewEngland, which Fleet took over and which had extensive tiesto some high-rate lenders.   John Strickland, president of Fleet Finance, anAtlanta-based Fleet unit that buys home-equity loans andsecond mortgages, says it carefully tracks the mortgagebrokers with which it does business. &quot;There are some badapples in any business&quot; and, when Fleet finds a broker orlender operating unethically, it severs the relationship, hesays.   Mr. Strickland insists that second-mortgage lendersprovide a valuable service. He says second-mortgage lendersextend credit &quot;to people who might not otherwise be able toget credit&quot; because of a blemish on their record, and addsthat it's perfectly reasonable to charge such borrowers more.&quot;The higher the risk, the higher the rate. It's not illegalto make a profit.&quot; But he says that the loans Fleet Bank madeto Resource &quot;never would have happened if we knew exactlywhat they were doing with the money.&quot; He says bankers &quot;can'tcontrol what customers do with money they borrow.&quot;   The Resource companies were sued this month in state courtin Boston by state Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, whoalleged unfair and deceptive practices and sought restitutionfor borrowers. The Resource group denies the charges.   A Boston Federal Reserve Bank survey last August showedthat Fleet, Shawmut, Bank of Boston, BayBanks Inc. and adozen other banks had ties to some high-rate lenders. Thesurvey found &quot;clear evidence of a link between banks and someof the high-rate second-mortgage firms,&quot; says Alicia Munnell,a Fed economist. At least 2,328 Boston mortgages between 1987and 1990 carried rates above 15%, and researchers say stifffees pushed effective rates far higher. Some mortgage lenderswere &quot;preying on minority neighborhoods,&quot; Ms. Munnell says.   Sharply rising home values in the 1980s, even in depressedneighborhoods, are one reason for the increase insecond-mortgage abuses. &quot;These firms have been strip-miningthe equity from minority communities,&quot; asserts Bruce Marks,director of Union Neighborhood Assistance Corp. in Boston. Hesays high-rate lenders have forced 1,000 foreclosures inBoston's minority sections since 1985.   Mr. Marks blames the banks. But, he says, &quot;It's not aconspiracy of evil businessmen sitting around the board roomsaying, `Let's take old people's homes.'&quot; Instead, he thinks,it's a consequence of tight credit, red-lining, bankderegulation and higher real-estate values.   Red-lining, in which banks avoid doing business indepressed neighborhoods, has been extensively documented inAtlanta, Boston, Chicago and other cities. A 1989 study bythe Boston Fed found convincing evidence of it in the city'sthree low-income, predominantly black sections by examining48,000 real-estate deals in 60 communities. It found farfewer mortgages granted in black neighborhoods relative tothe amount of mortgageable housing stock, a statistical gapthat couldn't be explained by lower levels of income orwealth. The Fed survey to be described today is expected toshow similar bias in lending.   And the abuses aren't confined to inner cities. Therecession, an ailing banking industry and the repeal of moststate usury laws have forced a growing number of borrowers toturn for credit to companies charging sky-high interest andfees.   Dorothy Flagg, a 77-year-old resident of rural Westfield,Mass., was one of them. She didn't realize anything was wronguntil her property-tax bill didn't come last May, as it hadfor 39 years. She says, &quot;I went down to the tax office, andthe girl behind the counter said, `I'm sorry, Mrs. Flagg, butyou don't own the house anymore.'&quot;   Mrs. Flagg still lives in the four-bedroom bungalow thathas been her family's home since 1952. She lost title to thehouse to State Finance andamp; Mortgage Co. over a $5,000 loan at20% interest she took to cover mounting medical expenses. Shewent to the firm after Bank of New England turned her down,even though she owned her home outright, had borrowed fromBank of New England before, and maintained a good creditrecord. Fleet, the bank's new owner, says it won't comment onBank of New England's actions prior to its acquisition.   State Finance and six banks were sued last month byAttorney General Harshbarger, who charged State Finance withfraud and sought to prevent the banks from foreclosing onnotes they held.   Harold Parker was another of the more than 60 victimsidentified in the attorney general's investigation. &quot;It'sharder than ever to get a loan, so we're stuck with loansharks,&quot; says Mr. Parker, who lost title to his home inSpringfield, Mass., over a $30,000 loan at 20% plus fees.   State Finance's owner, Walter LaBonte, didn't return callsseeking comment. He denied the state's charges in a filing inHampden, Mass., Superior Court.   Mr. Parker, 39, who works nights as a laboratorytechnician to support his wife and three children, firstheard about State Finance from a leaflet with a dollar billattached. &quot;There's more where this came from,&quot; it said. &quot;Getcash fast. We've got just the loan for you.&quot;   The suit alleges that Mr. LaBonte rushed customers intocontracts, discouraging them from reading documents orgetting a lawyer, and that the papers were confusing anddidn't conform to disclosure rules. Huge balloon payments(which were illegal before mortgage lending was deregulated adecade ago) were often required to retire the loans.   State Finance's largest backers were Bank of Boston, whichgave it a $650,000 line of credit, and BayBanks, whichextended $1.4 million. A BayBanks spokeswoman declines tocomment, though an attorney for the alleged victims, JosephConway, says the company has offered to settle the cases.Constance Hubbell, spokeswoman for Bank of Boston, says:&quot;We're not going to let anyone lose their homes, especiallyunder these circumstances.&quot; She adds that the lending officerwho approved the loans to State Finance no longer works forthe bank.   Many of the worst abuses arise from home-improvementcontractors who solicit business door-to-door in low-incomeneighborhoods and act as agents for high-rate lenders,victims' attorneys say.   On New York's Long Island, the ease with which high-rate,poorly documented home-equity mortgages could be sold insecondary markets fueled a new wave of the &quot;tin man&quot;home-improvement scheme -- named for the siding salesmen whopreyed on homeowners in the 1950s -- according to HarryKutner, a Mineola, N.Y., attorney. He alleges in a suit filedin federal district court in New York that the banks andfinance companies that bought the notes &quot;are just as culpablebecause they funded the fraud&quot; alleged to have been committedby the door-to-door salesmen who initiated the mortgages.   But sometimes the banks were victims, too, Mr. Kutnersays. He says the home-improvement or mortgage firms oftenpaid the first six months of these high-risk loans to build acredit history that would make it easier to sell the loans onthe secondary market. &quot;But why any bank would buy, withoutasking questions, a short-term, high-interest mortgage from ablind, 66-year-old woman with no income except SocialSecurity is beyond me,&quot; he says.   Still, Mr. Kutner doesn't think the banks acteddeliberately. &quot;They were sloppy,&quot; he says. &quot;They only caredabout the mortgage yield and didn't do the checking theyshould have done. They didn't see the misery and injustice.To them, it was just a piece of paper.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
