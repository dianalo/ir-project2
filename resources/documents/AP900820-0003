The lawsuit filed in Travis County state district court is thefirst challenge in the nation by deaf educators of a teachercertification exam, the group said.   One of the plaintiffs, Nancy Mumme, 32, said the test asksquestions about how to instruct students on the differences in thesound of certain letters.   ``How am I supposed to be identifying a sound?'' Ms. Mumme saidin sign language through an interpreter.   The lawsuit against the Texas Education Agency and State Boardof Education says deaf people who want to become teachers shouldn'thave to take the test until it has been adjusted.   The lawsuit was filed by the Texas Association of the Deaf andMs. Mumme.   Jorjanna Price, a spokeswoman for the education agency, saidlawyers for the agency had yet to see the lawsuit.   She said Education Commissioner W.N. Kirby has met with deafeducators. ``He said he wanted to look into the test matter,'' Ms.Price said.   Ms. Mumme, who has a Maryland teaching certificate, failed theTexas test twice.   Despite favorable evaluations and performance as a classroomteacher she was demoted last year and her contract at the TexasSchool for the Deaf has been canceled for this school year,according to the lawsuit.   ``I have been very, very frustrated. I cried and cried after Igot my test results back,'' she said in an emotional statement at anews conference.</TEXT></DOC>
