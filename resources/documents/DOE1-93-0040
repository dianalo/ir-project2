The indications for the diversionof cerebrospinal fluid to the peritoneal cavity or the right atrium isin part based on CT scan results. Reduced ventricular size is regardedas a sign of effective shunting. In case of acute shunt failure however,ventricular enlargement may take some time. The situation may furthermorebe misinterpreted because the last CT scan was taken a long time ago,or was taken during a previous episode of shunt failure. A CT scan shouldnever be used alone to exclude the diagnosis of shunt failure, especiallyif the clinical signs support this diagnosis. We have during the lastyears seen five children die from acute shunt failure where the correctdiagnosis was postponed partly because of misinterpreted CT scans.</TEXT></DOC>
