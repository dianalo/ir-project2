Even the political pronouncements emanating from the homeland's capital had a comical ring. &quot;I've done everything I could do for a beloved brother, but, nay, what a disappointment,&quot; declared Kaiser Matanzima, a former Transkei president, ruminating on the weekend downfall of his younger sibling and political foe, George. &quot;He deserves a whipping on the bottom.&quot;    But, as events unfold, the coup is being recognized as a lot more than just a family feud. It is being seen instead as a damning indictment of Pretoria's homeland policy, the centerpiece of grand apartheid's philosophy of separating blacks into tribal areas and giving them their own government. In 1976, Transkei became the first homeland to take &quot;independence&quot; -- a sovereignty recognized only by the South African government. Since then, three other homelands have become independent, with another one apparently about to do so.    The Transkei coup is confirming suspicions that the homelands are rife with corruption and nepotism and that they waste millions of dollars handed to them as subsidies by the South African government. It also illustrates what happens when Pretoria virtually handpicks the blacks it chooses to do business with, rather than letting the people choose.    With many activist blacks in jail or in hiding under the state of emergency, the government is trying to woo what it calls &quot;moderate&quot; black leaders -- including the homeland officials -- to participate in negotiations on a new constitution.    The coup came fast on the heels of a commission of inquiry into Transkei's finances that reported allegations of a one million rand ($500,000) payment to George Matanzima by a South African construction company. It also revealed that various Transkei officials may have pocketed millions from kickbacks on housing contracts and the construction of a harbor that hasn't been built.    These disclosures are an acute embarrassment to the Pretoria government. It pumps about $2 billion a year into the homelands, yet they have little to show for the money other than some modern government buildings, lavish housing for homeland leaders, airports named after prime ministers, a few tarred roads and a smattering of industry. The rest is mostly rural poverty and hunger.    A weekend drive through Transkei, from the capital Umtata to the glittering Wild Coast Sun hotel and casino on the Indian Ocean, revealed no sign of political unrest. But it highlighted the cavernous gap between the haves and have-nots.    Two days of rain and hail had turned Umtata into a quagmire. The shantytowns ringing the city were an ocean of mud, and residents, soaking wet, worked to keep the muck from seeping into their ramshackle houses. Up on a hill, on the southern edge of town, security guards kept an eye on a lush residential district, where the houses and cars are as fancy as any found in Johannesburg. This area, near George Matanzima Drive, is where the cabinet ministers live. There was a lot of coming and going over the weekend, as members of the old regime gave way to the new.    All along the homeland's major highway, rural Transkeians trudged along, some wearing ill-fitting shoes or no shoes at all. Few had protection against the rain and cold, other than blankets. For the most part, they live in little villages of round mud huts and survive off subsistence farming. In each of the larger villages, there is at least one new brick house with a Mercedes in the driveway. This, the people in the mud huts say, is for the local government representative.    In the northeast corner of Transkei, a short walk from the South African border, the Wild Coast Sun suddenly appears like an oasis on a desert. It was built as a playpen for high-rolling South Africans living in Natal province. Along with &quot;independence,&quot; the homelands receive a license for casino gaming, which is prohibited in South Africa proper.    The coup certainly didn't deter the gamblers. At one slot machine inside, a car salesman from Durban says the only coup interesting him is the one he is trying to score on the Pots of Gold slots. About that other coup, the one in Umtata, he matter-of-factly asks, &quot;What do you expect? This is a homeland, isn't it?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
