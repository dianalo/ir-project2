Converterblocks hold constants, built-in functions (such as financial and statisticalfunctions), algebraic equations and graphical functions.andP;  Connectors linkyour convertors and stocks.andM;The grabber hand works like the similar hands in HyperCard or SuperPaint,selecting, opening and repositioning building blocks.andP;  The ghost tool makes&quot;clones&quot; of an entity, copying it and pasting it where desired.andP;  The cameraimports PICT files for illustrating your model, and the dynamite acts as adelete tool for building blocks.andM;Suppose you wanted to create a model for complicated income statements foryour business.andP;  The first thing you would do is define the purpose of themodel, using pictures to define the parts (sectors or actors in IThinkparlance).andP;  Next, you would lay out the model in detail, sector by sector,describing all the &quot;plumbing&quot; that the model will need.andP;  Building blocks fora financial model might include revenues, expenses, assets, employees,widgets sold and so on.andP;  Since IThink gives you a number of generic modelinfrastructures and generic processes, specifying the guts of your model iseasier than you might think.andM;Once you've laid out and connected building blocks, you define theirmathematical relationships in much the same way you input spreadsheetformulas.andP;  Finally, you must test your model and make modifications so itapproaches reality as closely as possible.andP;  This involves entering internallyconsistent numerical values and monitoring their transformations, along withusing test inputs, such as pulse and step functions.andM;Ultimately, you will end up modifying the parameter sensitivity of some ofyour model's processes, while scrapping and heavily modifying otherprocesses.andP;  IThink has a powerful Sensitivity function that lets you plotsuccessive runs of the same process on the same graph.andM;Posting the results.andP;  Finally, you need to get the results out.andP;  For this youcan create a model control panel, illustrate your model diagram with picturesand text, and document the equations you have built.andP;  You'll also use thegraphical function and the Graph Pad dialog to build output graphs that tracethe time-series numerical output of your model.andP;  Graphs can be represented asscatter plots; comparative line graphs; and multiple-run, single-variablecharts, among others.andM;Spreadsheetlike output can be specified using the Table Pad dialog.andP;  Thisfeature is especially useful if you need to record lots of output data forfurther modeling or analysis with other software.andP;  The pages produced by theGraph and Table pads now can be fully formatted and are completelyaccessible; the variables are rescaled automatically when you run thesimulation, keeping the display neat and clean.andP;  Pages also can be torn offand repositioned for easier viewing of results.andM;Sixteen colors are now available for diagramming and output.andP;  These arewelcome, but we still wish for full color capability.andP;  Most of the 16 colorsin Apple's four-bit palette are just not useful for businesslike output.andM;Other new functions.andP;  Besides turning model stocks into queues, conveyors andovens, IThink includes other new tools that make it easier to simulatediscrete events, like those you find in engineering and financial processes.andO;The new built-in functions include the Poisson distribution and nth-orderderivatives.andP;  You also can now create discontinuous graphical functions aswell as continuous ones.andM;The three completely rewritten manuals cover the system from soup to nuts andinclude separate quick-start reference cards for experienced modelers.andO;IThink also runs considerably faster than Stella 2.10.andP;  On a Mac IIcx, IIciand IIfx, the performance difference was easily detectable.andP;  IThink also runsmuch more smoothly than Stella 2.10.andP;  Gone are the annoying time breaks thatoften marred a running simulation.andM;The average user will use IThink's default simulation algorithms, whichproduce perfectly acceptable results in most cases.andP;  However, the simulationexpert can choose among Euler's, second-order Runge-Kutta and fourth-orderRunge-Kutta methods, as well as select the appropriate step size andintegration method.andP;  High Performance Systems even includes documentationthat tells you how to translate a system of ordinary differential equationsinto an IThink model.andM;Because of the new simulation options and features in IThink, a conversionutility is necessary to convert Stella 2.10 models.andP;  The manuals also includespecial sections on the new features and changes to the Stella 2.10 commandstructure.andP;  Since the underlying simulation algorithms haven't changed, youshould have little trouble converting over any properly functioning Stella2.10 model to IThink.andM;Conclusions.andP;  The IThink manuals call the program a &quot;visual spreadsheet&quot; andemphasize its ability to foster &quot;visual thinking.&quot; This claim comes close toreality and many business users will benefit from transforming their staticspreadsheet models into dynamic ones.andP;  We highly recommend it for thethinking manager.andM;High Performance Systems Inc. is at 45 Lyme Road, Suite 300, Hanover, N.H.andO;03755.andP;  Phone (603) 643-9636; fax (603) 643-9502.andM;Appointment-calendar managersandM;andgt;Agent DA 1.03 from TeamBuilding Technologies Inc. is an excellent calendarprogram marred primarily by the difficulty of entering multiple appointmentsand its unchangeably small display text.andP;  If you want reminders as well,however, you'll probably wind up having to enter them individually in thereminder program you choose.andM;andgt;Alarming Events from CE Software Inc. is an outstanding reminder program butlimited in its calendar features (a pity, since the integration is seamless).andM;andgt;CalenDAr 1.1 from Psybron Systems Inc. is a basic reminder program withexceptional sound capabilities.andP;  It lacks sophisticated features, and itsinability to import data makes it difficult to integrate with a separatecalendar program.andP;  For simple, straightforward reminders, however, it'sgreat.andM;andgt;Smart Alarms 3.03 and Appointment Diary 3.1, both from JAM Software USA,make up a package that offers excellent calendar management and very goodreminder features.andP;  However, the integration could be better, and thecalendar program, though flexible, lacks automated features that some userswill want.andM;andgt;My Time Manager 3.0 from MacShack Enterprises has more features than thecompetition as a calendar program but lets you miss reminders too easily.andO;Some will love it for the features; we found the displays crowded.andP;  Theprogram was harder to learn than the others, and not all features worked aspromised.andM;Because people work differently, the key to satisfaction with a calendar orreminder program is finding one with features that match your needs.andP;  Here'sa rundown of some easily overlooked questions you should consider.andM;andgt;Reminders.andP;  We find a reminder system indispensable, but it's no help ifyour computer is off or if you're away.andP;  All these programs exceptTeamBuilding Technologies Inc.'s Agent DA will display an on-screen reminderfor selected items on your schedule.andP;  Once a reminder is displayed, you maywant to change or postpone it.andP;  JAM Software's Smart Alarms and CE Software'sAlarming Events let you do this easily, Psybron Systems' CalenDAr lets youpostpone a reminder but makes you invoke the DA to edit one, and MacShackEnterprises' My Time Manager requires you to run the program to modifyreminders.andM;andgt;Data entry.andP;  If you or your assistant are going to start by recording a busyschedule for the next six months, ease of entry can make the differencebetween satisfaction and homicide.andP;  Overall, we found Smart Alarms theeasiest for entering information, though moving back and forth between thecalendar and reminder aspects of the package can be annoying.andP;  AlarmingEvents and My Time Manager, which required switching back and forth betweenmouse and keyboard, were the most cumbersome.andP;  My Time Manager, multi-userAppointment Diary and Alarming Events can all import data from tab-delimitedtext files.andP;  Although it may take some time to set up the file, this is byfar the easiest way to set up a large number of events.andM;andgt;Recurring appointments.andP;  Recurring appointments are a real problem, and noneof these programs deals well with all the possibilities.andP;  None, for instance,could easily handle an event on &quot;every Tuesday but Christmas for the nextfive months.&quot; Alarming Events, CalenDAr and Smart Alarms let you setrecurring events for specified intervals (every five days or every thirdweek, for example) and so does My Time Manager, with some additionalflexibility.andP;  Appointment Diary and Agent DA both require you to setrecurring appointments by copying the first one.andM;andgt;Editing.andP;  You often may need to move or copy a schedule entry.andP;  Agent DAmakes this a snap, and Appointment Diary allows full use of Copy and Pastecommands.andP;  My Time Manager also has useful copying techniques.andP;  The othersmake it easy to move an entry but not to copy one.andM;andgt;Display.andP;  If all you want is an appointment diary, the standardchronological display of events will surely be sufficient.andP;  But if you alsokeep track of things to do and special events such as birthdays, you may notwant to attach a time to every entry.andP;  Moreover, you may want to enter thingsto do in order of priority and change that order from time to time.andO;Appointment Diary offers the most flexibility in display; CalenDAr, theleast.andM;andgt;Printing.andP;  All the programs except CalenDAr have some printing options, butnone is well-designed for printing pages to fit into a pocket organizer.andP;  Ifyou're fussy about print formats, you'll want to set up a template in yourword processor or database, export the data to a text file and print fromanother application.andM;andgt;Other machines.andP;  A large number of people maintain several calendars: one onthe office computer, for example; another on a home machine; a list on aportable computer; and another on a pocket organizer like the Sharp Wizard orthe Casio Boss.andP;  The Smart Alarms/Appointment Diary package provides a customformat for the Cambridge Z88, and My Time Manager imports and exports inCasio Boss format, but updates across several machines will be anorganizational hassle nonetheless.andP;
