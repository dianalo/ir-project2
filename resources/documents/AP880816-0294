Kay Orr, the co-chairman of the Republican platformcommittee, to the Republican National Convention Tuesday night:   Thank you very, very much. Nebraska, you are so special to me.   Tonight, I want to tell you exactly who our Republican platformis for.   Our platform is far, far superior to the one the Democratscobbled together in Atlanta. The difference is simple. Republicansshare their vision with the American people. Democrats hide fromthe people.   Last week, 106 women and men arrived here, here in New Orleansto construct the platform that reflects our party's deepest beliefsand aims. George Bush spoke to us last week and shared with us hisvision on a whole range of issues that confront our country:keeping taxes low for economic growth, preserving peace throughstrength, fighting drugs and improving education.   The vice president said that Governor Dukakis was the stealthcandidate. Like the stealth bomber, Dukakis tried to hide himselfand his positions from the people. George Bush is right and theDemocrats' platform proves it.   You know, fellow delegates, you won't find some very basic wordsin the Democratic platform. Words like ``tax,'' or ``revenue,'' or``unemployment.'' You won't find any mention of NATO, and you won'tfind words like ``church'' or ``synagogue.''   The Democrats want to hide their views from the American peoplebecause they knew that if the people ever found out what theyreally believed, they would lose. They don't want people to knowthat they are still the party that will raise taxes and weaken ourdefense.   Let me give you one example of the contrast between our platformand Democrats' stealth platform. We say loud and clear what VicePresident Bush has said so many times: We won't raise taxes,period. Higher taxes cost jobs.   But the Democrats' platform doesn't say a word about taxes. Why?   Last month, there was a poll taken of the Democratic delegates.And that poll showed the Democrats' hypocrisy. Sixty-seven percentof the delegates favored a tax increase; but 65 percent said theywanted to keep it out of the platform.   On issue after issue the contrast is clear _ Democrats saynothing. Or else they quote their views in empty rhetoric. ButRepublicans tell the American people exactly what we stand for andexactly where we will lead this country after we win November.   We're for children's tax credits, to let the parents decide howtheir children will be cared for. We're for college savings bonds,to help families save for college. We're for aggressive action inthe war on drugs, including mandatory sentencing for drug dealers.   If any of you is still skeptical, we'll prove it to you. Justwrite the Republican National Committee in Washington and ask for acopy of the side-by-side platforms that I'm holding. Or you canwrite your local newspaper and ask them to print it, so that allthe voters will understand that we are the party of opportunity andunderstand where the two parties stand.   Fellow Republicans and Americans, I am very proud to representthe people of the state of Nebraska. People in Nebraska are specialpeople who provide us not only with the products of their hardwork. But they are also a people who have a way of life that isbased on sound values and common sense. Rural America is theheartland in more ways than one.   The contribution of farming families to our country is not onlyeconomic but moral. For the values that are needed to be a goodfarmer are the same values that built America. Farmers have beenthrough some tough and painful times recently. But at the sametime, Republicans are optimistic about the future of Americanagriculture.   We reject the Democrats' idea of mandatory production controls.   Instead, we know that farmers can return to prosperity if wewill take a few basic steps. We want to open markets abroad. Wewill not use food as a foreign policy weapon.   We want to find new uses for farm products. And Vice PresidentBush has taken the lead here with his strong advocacy ofalternative fuels like ethanol.   And we want to keep our rural communities strong through theincreased efforts at economic development. As a governor of a farmstate, I know that the future of American farming will be securewith George Bush as president.   Michael Dukakis, Michael Dukakis knows so little aboutagriculture that he told the farmers of Iowa that they ought to trygrowing Belgian endive.   Fellow Republicans, our platform presents a vision of America, avision that is optimistic and bold and daring. It reflects ourpride in what we have done and our competence in what we will do.   The Democrats missed their chance to level with the Americanpeople. We didn't and George Bush and Dan Quayle will lead ourparty to victory in November.</TEXT><HEAD>End Orr Text _ 1 Take</HEAD></DOC>
