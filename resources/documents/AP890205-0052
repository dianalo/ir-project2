The ministers, beginning their meeting Monday, also plan todiscuss new ways for the 49-member Commonwealth _ former componentsof the British empire _ to bolster poor black-ruled statesthreatened by South African destabilization, organizers said.   Britain is not a member of the committee because of PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher's opposition to sanctions. Thatchermaintains black South Africans, and neighboring states, will suffermost from tougher measures against the Pretoria government.   Canadian External Affairs Minister Joe Clark, who arrivedSaturday in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare, will chair the thirdthree-day meeting of the so-called Commonwealth Committee of ForeignMinisters on Southern Africa.   ``Given the location of this meeting and the specialcircumstances of the frontline states the committee has agreed thatdestabilization be the theme of the Harare meeting,'' a statementfrom the Canadian High Commission here said on the eve of the talks.   Zimbabwe, South Africa's northern neighbor, is one of the six``frontline states'' _ southern Africa countries that are inconfrontation with Pretoria over its racial policy of apartheid.   The regional bloc, grouping also Angola, Botswana, Mozambique,Tanzania and Zambia, spearheads African efforts for moreinternational pressure on Pretoria.   It also seeks massive aid and investment for the fragileeconomies of its members to counter South African economic andmilitary retaliation. Most frontliners are heavily dependent onSouth Africa, economic powerhouse of the region, for trade and fortransport links with the outside world.   Britain, Japan, the United States and West Germany are frequentlysingled out by the frontline states for ignoring calls for toughersanctions. But the Commonwealth has little real muscle inconfronting South Africa without Mrs. Thatcher's support.   The Southern Africa committee was formed by the 26th Commonwealthsummit in Vancouver, Canada, in 1987 to monitor sanctions andpropose ways of tightening the economic blockade against SouthAfrica to force that country to abandon its apartheid system. Thecommittee met twice last year, in the Zambian capital of Lusaka andin Toronto, Canada.   Under apartheid, South Africa's 5 million whites virtuallycontrol the economy and government and live mainly apart from the 26million blacks, who have no vote in national affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
