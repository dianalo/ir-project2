(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   One of the Navy's last diesel-electricsubmarines lay on the ocean's surface tied to a rescue vesselMonday after a underwater explosions and a toxic fire injured 22sailors and left three missing.   The 30-year-old USS Bonefish, its remaining crew evacuated toshore bases, floated alongside the submarine rescue ship USS Petrelabout 160 miles off Florida, said Lt. Cmdr. Aaron Long, a spokesmanat Atlantic Fleet headquarters in Norfolk.   There was no apparent danger that the submarine, which carriesonly conventional weapons, would sink, said Chief Petty OfficerTerry D. Borton, a fleet spokesman.   It was not known if the missing men were aboard the sub or inthe water.   Long said preliminary indications pointed toward a series ofexplosions, including one in the battery compartment, but he saidhe was unable to say precisely where the other explosions occurredon the ship. The fire broke out in the forward battery compartment,he said.   The Charleston, S.C.-based USS Petrel arrived on the sceneMonday afternoon, but Navy officials said any decision to board thesubmarine was being delayed until Tuesday.   ``The decision made was that no one goes aboard'' until thePetrel's experts declare the ship free of dangerous fumes Tuesdaymorning, Long said.   The Petrel, based in Charleston, S.C., was alongside thesubmarine with a line attached to keep the submarine from drifting,Long said.   ``They are waiting until daybreak to commence any operation. Noone has boarded the vessel at this point,'' Long said.   Also steaming to the scene was the salvage ship USS Hoist fromthe Little Creek Amphibious Base in Norfolk.   The explosion occurred Sunday afternoon in the boat's batterycompartment while the Bonefish was submerged on a routine trainingmission, said Borton.   The explosion triggered a fire that filled the 219-foot vesselwith smoke and toxic fumes. The sub surfaced and Cmdr. Mike Wilson,the commander, ordered it evacuated.   The frigate USS Carr, which also was in the training exercise,took aboard 89 of the Bonefish's 92 crewmen. The McCloy, which alsowas training nearby, reached the Bonefish before nightfall, theNavy said.   Also steaming to the scene and expected to arrive Tuesday wasthe salvage ship USS Hoist from the Little Creek Amphibious Base inNorfolk.   The Bonefish was launched in 1958 from New York Shipbuilding inCamden, N.J. It is powered on the surface by three 1,500-horsepowerdiesel engines that drive a single propeller and charge batteries.While submerged, the batteries power two electric motors.   The Bonefish and its two sister ships, the Barbel and Blueback,are among the last of the Navy's diesel-electric submarines and areused principally to mimic Soviet submarines in training exercises.The Soviets still operate about 100 diesel-electric boats.   The Bonefish is the second Navy vessel to bear that name. Thefirst, a World War II submarine, disappeared in the Sea of Japan inJune 1945 while on combat patrol.   The 22 injured were transferred to the aircraft carrier John F.Kennedy, which steamed to Mayport, Fla. From there they were flownto the Naval Hospital in Jacksonville. The other crewmen were takento Mayport by the Carr and flown to the Charleston Air Force Base,where they arrived Monday afternoon.   Atlantic Fleet headquarters said two sailors were seriouslyinjured, but the nature and extent of their injuries was notimmediately available.   The majority of the sailors disembarked from the Carr in Mayportwearing blue overalls and sneakers, though many were shoeless.   Reporters were not allowed to talk to the crewmen when theyreturned to Charleston. They looked grim as they walked across thetarmac to meet about 30 waiting relatives. One woman wore a jacketreading ``Diesel Boats Forever'' beneath a cartoon of a submarine.   One Bonefish sailor aboard a bus awaiting transport back to theNavy base was asked if he and his shipmates were alright.   ``Yes, thank God for that,'' said the unidentified crewman. Herefused to comment about conditions on the boat during the fire.   The Navy identified the missing men as Lt. Ray Everts of Naoma,W.Va., Petty Officer 1st Class Robert W. Bordelon Jr. of Willis,Texas, and Petty Officer 3rd Class Marshall T. Lindgren of PisgahForest, N.C.</TEXT></DOC>
