Institutefunded projects have addressed such topics as the role of third-party negotiatorsin the resolution of regional conflicts; religious and ethical questionsin war and peace; the use of nonviolent sanctions in confronting politicalviolence; global security in the nuclear age; and the relationship betweendomestic political systems and the aggressive use of force.<ITAG tagnum="84">Solicited Grants</ITAG>In addition to its established practice of providing support for unsolicitedgrant proposals, the Institute is initiating a program of solicited grantprojects which will serve to focus attention an topics of special interest.Topics selected for consideration in the current grant cycle are:andbullet; <T3>The Role of Deterrence in Avoiding War</T3>The principles of deterrence have been central to national policies throughoutthis century. The Institute will sponsor studies to (1) review the currentstatus of theories related to deterrence; (2) examine the effectivenessof deterrence in past cases during the twentieth century, and any reasonsfor deterrence failures; and (3) review the possible future operation ofdeterrence for the U.S. and other countries, including its relevance inboth nuclear and nonnuclear settings. The review of the future role ofdeterrence will take into account present and potential future arms controlagreements and possible changes in relationships between the United Statesand the Soviet Union. All work will be based on a prior explanation andjustification of how the particular project will relate to other work thathas been carried out or is planned in this area of research.andbullet; <T3>Comparative Study of Armed Conflicts in the Third World</T3>Conflicts in the Third World currently account for most of the world'swars. The Institute will fund studies which examine such issues as (1)how to resolve such conflicts or, at a minimum, control them at a levelshort of the breakdown of regional order with possible global implications;(2) the role of external powers in such conflicts; (3) the role of thirdparties, whether they are international organizations, states, or individuals,in affecting the continuation or mediation of conflict; (4) the abilityof regional actors to negotiate settlements and to advance regional cooperation;and (5) structural and systemic changes which may contribute to more stablerelations, including regional arms-control agreements. The impact on suchregions of the proliferation of nuclear arms and chemical weapons willalso be examined.andbullet; <T3>Teaching Public Understanding of the Geneva Conventions</T3>The Geneva Conventions call for the full dissemination of the conventionsin signatory countries. The Institute will fund a project to assist ineducating the public on the laws of war as called for by the conventions.The project would involve a survey of the current state of such education,identification of needs for additional dissemination, and the preparationof curriculum tools, handbooks, articles, films, and other material fordistribution in the United States and other countries. The Institute maywish to explore this project in conjunction with the International Committeeof the Red Cross.andbullet; <T3>The Relationship Between Different Types of Domestic Regimes and theAggressive Use of Force Internationally</T3>Policymakers and analysts continue to debate the extent to which countrieswith different types of political structures and arrangements (both formaland informal) differ in their willingness to use force aggressively ininternational relations. The Institute will support studies which empiricallyexamine the records of various types of regimes in this regard, includingthe relationship between willingness to commit aggression and domesticpolitical cultures, legal systems, and human rights policy. The specialstrengths and shortcomings of democracies in dealing with questions ofpeace and war are of special interest to the Institute. Studies will besponsored which examine the problems of continuity in policy making andpolicy implementation in democratic regimes, including the effects of theseparation of powers and other aspects of the potential fractionalizationof the policy process. These studies will consider the experience of democraciesin managing international conflicts including the process of conductingnegotiations, the preparation for adequate defense, overall conduct indeterring conflict, decisions to use force, termination of ongoing conflict,and the role of public opinion.andbullet; <T3>Religion, Peace and War</T3>In many parts of the world religion is playing an increasingly criticalrole in influencing the resolution of international conflicts. The Institutewill support projects which examine the role of religion both historicallyand with regard to contemporary affairs. Topics for study may include (1)religious doctrine and its role as a source of political stability andprecipitator of political change; (2) the nature of belief systems andcausal links, if any, to patterns of violence or nonviolence; (3) religionas a means of reconciliation between groups and states; (4) the natureof religious forces and their interaction with secular elements in politicalsystems; and (5) religion as a transnational phenomenon and as an alternativeto formal or governmental institutions for conflict management and conflictresolution. These studies may focus on the regional aspects of these matters,including the role of religious institutions and doctrines in the MiddleEast, in Latin America, in Eastern Europe, and in the western democracies.<ITAG tagnum="84">How to Apply</ITAG>The Institute encourages applications from nonprofit organizations, officialpublic institutions, and individuals.
