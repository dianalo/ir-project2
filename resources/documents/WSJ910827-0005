But in practical terms that definitiontranslates into: Don't even ask for a new loan.   That isn't stopping Wall Street from rushing in wherebankers decline to tread. Just last week AMI and its parent,American Medical Holdings Inc., wrapped up more than $200million from a junk bond issue and another $160 million in acommon stock offering.                                                                                                          It's been like that all year. While a number of the highlyleveraged companies are struggling under heavy debt loads andmay be headed for bankruptcy, many others have metexpectations and are eager to go back to the well for morecapital. And the reluctance of banks to add to their HLTportfolios, no matter how good the credit, is pushing a lotof business Wall Street's way. These are the companies thatmade big acquisitions, entered into management buy-outs orgave special stock dividends to shareholders.   &quot;It's our gain,&quot; says William Reid, a managing director ofFirst Boston Corp. In January, his high-yield finance groupfocused for new business on 70 companies that had loaded upon debt in the late 1980s. Of that group, 47 have sincerelied on investment bankers to &quot;complete or initiatetransactions that reduced their indebtedness and theirdependence on banks,&quot; he says.   More than 30 leveraged buy-outs of the 1980s, includingDuracell International Inc., AnnTaylor Stores Inc., FreuhaufTrailer Corp. and Interstate Bakeries Inc., have sold over$2.3 billion in common stock this year, according toInvestment Dealers Digest. And the level of new high-yield&quot;junk&quot; bond offerings from HLT-designated companies,including $1.5 billion raised for RJR Nabisco Inc., isrunning three times the pace of last year.   Ironically, much of the action by these companies is aimedat getting the banks to stop identifying them as HLTs sobanks can resume their traditional financing role. InFebruary, bank regulators clarified the definition andspecified how a company can shed its highly leverageddesignation. For instance, the company could reduce its debtto 75% or less of the value of its assets. Or, it couldoperate for two years as an HLT and pay down all its originalHLT debt with, among other things, new capital.   Banking regulators say they never intended the HLT labelas a credit monitor. &quot;But bank boards of directors havebecome fearful&quot; of large exposure to the group as a whole and&quot;have forced managements to stop lending,&quot; says RobertAlbertson, banking analyst for Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. Investorshave also taken a dim view of banks with large HLTportfolios, even though HLTs are much less a threat thancommercial real estate loans.   Rick Sobrevinas, head of the leveraged finance group ofthe New York branch of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, says that whenhe or other bankers attempt to syndicate a large bank loan,&quot;If you say it's an HLT, they say, `sorry we can't take it.'It's like a disease.&quot;   But &quot;the broader capital markets aren't encumbered by theHLT designation,&quot; says Michael Zimmerman, a managing directorof Salomon Brothers. &quot;So, they can look to the underlyingcredit and value of the issuer.&quot;   The resulting &quot;anomaly,&quot; says Mr. Sobrevinas, is that&quot;it's more difficult getting senior bank debt than riskiersubordinated debt and common or preferred equity. It shouldbe the other way around.&quot;   To be sure, some of the financing that leveraged companiesare doing through Wall Street would be taking place even ifthe banks were ready, willing and able. But there's moredemand than usual to do deals because casting off the HLTalbatross not only makes banks eager to loan, but also to doso at cheaper rates and with less onerous restrictions.   Most of the 70 companies that First Boston monitors are&quot;doing whatever they can do to escape HLT status,&quot; says Mr.Reid of First Boston. Some are urging their banks to &quot;share&quot;collateral used to back existing loans to also back newissues of senior notes, the proceeds of which would go to paydown the bank loans.   Those companies putting their stock back into the public'shands are typically reducing their debt below 70% of assetsfrom the 90% level, thus qualifying them for HLT delisting,Mr. Reid says.   In the case of Interstate Bakeries, a 1987 leveragedbuy-out that sold $250 million of stock in late July, theratio went down to 69%. And contingent on the proceeds beingused to pay off some debt and redeemable preferred stock, thecompany simultaneously entered into a new $230 million bankloan at 1 3/4 percentage points below the old rate. Butpricing could jump back up if there is a reclassification toHLT status.   The HLT delisting was &quot;an important consideration behindthe stock offering,&quot; says an investment banker from FirstBoston, which was lead manager on the deal. It not only opensthe door to new bank capital, but also the lower interestrates should boost earnings and support the stock, allowingInterstate to go on the acquisition trail for other bakeries.   Tyson Foods is already seeing the advantage of sheddingits HLT status, which occurred six months ago, following a$100 million stock issue last year. &quot;There's more competitionamong banks for our loans,&quot; says Gerald Johnson, executivevice-president in charge of finance.   At Illinois Central Corp., which raised $63 million in anew stock offer several months ago, dropping the HLT label isa goal because it automatically means lower prices onexisting loans. With another six months of retained earnings,the freight railroad company should qualify, says DalePhillips, chief financial officer. At that point, annualinterest charges on $100 million of bank loans will declineas much as three-quarters of a percentage point.   The savings from delisting are even greater for RJRNabisco. Banks have told the company they would refinancetheir loans (approximately $5.5 billion) at savings of asmuch as 1 3/4 percentage point a year, the company said in arecent letter to bank regulators. It added that currentefforts to raise $70 million from banks for equipmentfinancing are going slowly even with a rate of 2.5 percentagepoints above the London Interbank Offered Rate, which is whatmajor banks in London charge each other for overnight loans.   &quot;If we were a non-HLT borrower, this type of transactioncould be accomplished in large size at rates of approximatelyLIBOR plus&quot; one-half percentage point, says Karl M. von derHeyden, chief financial officer.   Avoiding the HLT designation in the first place is just asimportant as shedding it. &quot;A whole series of deals that wouldhave been HLTs are now structured to escape the net,&quot; saysCharles Kiley, a managing director of Bankers Trust Co. Thesimplest way, he says, is to pump in more equity from thestart.   At Trident NGL Inc., a natural-gas processing businessthat is being acquired from Occidental Petroleum Co. for $690million, the new buyers are putting in $185 million inequity, about three times as much as would have been neededin the 1980s. The equity was increased from $170 million whenthe HLT status still loomed and a few banks in the $390million bank syndicate balked, according to bankers involvedin the deal.   But for those companies that already are tagged HLT, notall have the alternative of turning to Wall Street for help.&quot;Somewhere between the very large and the very small, whichhave strong relationships with their local banks, is theproblem,&quot; says Mr. Albertson of Goldman Sachs. They don'thave much access to public markets, including commercialpaper, or corporate IOUs, and are the hardest-hit victims ofthe credit crunch, he says.   &quot;The HLT designation is in danger of unwittingly divertingcapital from many deserving industries, particularly in themiddle market, which is the backbone of the U.S. economy,&quot;adds Mr. Sobrevinas. He said many bankers remain confused bythe definitions of an HLT and what it takes to delist acompany, confusion that contributes to the credit crunch.   The regulatory clarification in February even threw somecompanies into HLT status that hadn't been there before. Oneof these was Tele-Communications Inc., the giant cabletelevision company. When that happened as a result ofconsolidating liabilities of all its units, banks that hadalready committed to a new loan withdrew. The company has yetto have a new bank facility in place, said Bernard Schotters,vice president of finance. &quot;There was no adverse change inour credit quality; it was really a matter of whether we arean HLT.&quot;   Cable television and many other media companies areespecially hard hit by the HLT status because they oftenretain strong cash flow despite heavy debt loads, says DeckerAnstrom, executive vice president of the National CableTelevision Association. By not taking cash flow into account,the typical measure for determining additional debt capacity,regulators are &quot;forcing&quot; HLT companies &quot;to go to foreignbanks for financing,&quot; he said.   Mr. Schotters of TCI and others are urging regulators tomake cash flow the key to determining HLT status. Regulatorsrecently have extended through late September the commentperiod for further changes in the HLT designation.   Getting more companies out of HLT status is clearly in thebankers' interest as well. Terrence Mogen, senior creditofficer for global corporate finance at Bankers Trust, says,&quot;We and our colleagues at other banks prowl the financialstatements with more interest if a company passes the magicRubicon.&quot;</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
