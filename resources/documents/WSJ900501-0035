The company, just a step below the nation's major oilcompanies in size, owns considerable natural gas and crudeoil reserves in Indonesia, the British North Sea and the Gulfof Mexico. It also has an interest in large petrochemicaloperations in Louisiana.</LP><TEXT>   Union Texas is 40%-owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.and 40%-owned by Allied-Signal Inc.   The company said directors have authorized executives &quot;toexplore a sale of the company and other alternatives.&quot; Thesellers haven't picked an investment banker to handle thesale.   Union Texas said that a transaction isn't guaranteed,recalling the difficulty the company had in its initialpublic offering in September 1987, when the two controllingshareholders pulled out of the sale at the last minute. Theresult was a drastically reduced offering in both price andsize. The company said any sale probably wouldn't becompleted before November.   Still, the current outlook for oil companies is morebullish than a few years ago, and Union Texas's assets areviewed favorably. &quot;This is a quality company,&quot; said Ronald J.Barone, an oil analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. in New York.   Wall Street experts yesterday valued the company at $1.85billion to $2.06 billion, though many energy properties soldin the past two years have exceeded their appraised values.The estimates work out to a range of $22 to $24.50 a share.Union Texas shares rose $2.625 yesterday to $20.50 in NewYork Stock Exchange composite trading.   Allied appears to be somewhat more optimistic, setting atarget of about $1 billion for the sale of its 40% stake inUnion Texas. &quot;That's in the ballpark of what we think wemight be able to get,&quot; a company spokesman said in MorrisTownship, N.J.   Edward L. Hennessy Jr., chairman of Allied and a UnionTexas director, told shareholders at the annual meetingyesterday that the aerospace and automotive products companywould use proceeds to reduce debt and buy back stock.   KKR owns 33.3 million shares plus warrants. A sale at $25a share would give KKR $832 million on its stock and $145million for its warrants, or a total of $978 million -- ornearly four times KKR's original investment of $250 millionin 1985. That's a total return of a little more than 30%annually.   While that sort of return doesn't match the 50% annualrates that some leveraged buy-out funds once boasted of, it'sa piece of good news in comparison with some of the woes thathave afflicted KKR and other buy-out firms since the collapseof the junk-bond market.   KKR had been criticized for the deal a few years backafter oil prices plunged from $28 to $8 a barrel. Now thatoil prices have rebounded, the investment looks a lot better-- particularly in comparison with some of KKR's leveragedbuy-outs which have soured, such as Seaman Furniture Co. andHillsborough Holdings Inc.   In New York, KKR declined to comment on the planned sale.   While Allied has wanted to sell its stake for some time,it isn't clear what triggered yesterday's announcement. Someon Wall Street believe that Allied was prepared to sell evenif KKR wasn't, and that may have prompted KKR to go along toavoid either a partner it wouldn't like or a minorityposition.   Commenting on the timing, a Union Texas spokeswoman said,&quot;There continues to be a lot of interest in oil and gasproperties. The Huffco sale is an example of that,&quot; she said,referring to the sale of Huffington Corp. to Taiwan'snational oil company last month.   Huffington's primary asset was a 20% interest in anIndonesian joint venture in which Union Texas has a stakealmost double that size. The venture supplies natural gas toone of the world's largest liquefied natural gas facilities.A sale price wasn't disclosed but oil industry speculationputs it roughly at $500 million to $700 million.   Mr. Barone of Kidder Peabody values Union Texas'sIndonesian interest at $1.1 billion. It accounts for 1.24trillion feet of the company's 2.01 trillion cubic feet ofnatural gas reserves. U.S. operations, at 581 billion cubicfeet at year-end 1989, represent the second-biggest portionof the company's gas reserves. Along with 30 million barrelsof oil reserves, combined U.S. reserves are valued by Mr.Barone at about $688 million.   Union Texas's total world-wide crude reserves are 140million barrels, the biggest part of which -- 79 millionbarrels -- lie in the British North Sea.   The company also holds a 42% interest in a Geismar, La.,chemical plant that produces ethylene, valued by one industryexpert at about $300 million.   Union Texas reported first-quarter earnings of $31million, or 23 cents a share, on revenue of $311 million, andhas maintained an aggressive capital spending program,raising its budget 41% this year to $361 million.   Allied acquired Union Texas in 1962, though the company'sgrowth accelerated only in the late 1960s. Union Texas beganas a sulfur company in Sulphur, La., in 1896 and entered theoil business in 1926.</TEXT></DOC>
