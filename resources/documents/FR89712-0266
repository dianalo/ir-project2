When Congress amended the Act in 1977,it created a new Part D, which required a new planning process to revisethe SIPs for areas that were exceeding the NAAQS.Congress enacted Section 110(c) in 1970 as the sole means of ensuring thatits goal of clean air was not frustrated in the event a State defaultedon its planning obligations. If a State fails to submit a SIP which meets(or is determined by the Administrator to not be in accordance with) therequirements of Section 110, then Section 110(c)(1) provides that the USEPAAdministrator may prepare, propose, and promulgate regulations settingforth an implementation plan. Congress included new sanctions when it enactedPart D in 1977, which included a ban on the construction or modificationof major stationary emission sources in nonattainment areas for which aPart D plan has not been approved. The intent was clearly to induce Stateand local governments to fulfill their obligation to develop plans assuringthe attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS, and, thus, minimize the Federalrole in the attainment planning process.<ITAG tagnum="84">Chicago Area Part D Ozone Plans</ITAG>Under Section 107 of the Act, USEPA designated certain areas in Illinoisand Indiana as not attaining the NAAQS (nonattainment area) for ozone.See 43 FR 8962 (March 3, 1978), and 43 FR 45993 (October 5, 1978). Forthese areas, Part D of the Act required that each of these States reviseits SIP to provide for attaining the primary NAAQS by December 31, 1982.However, for ozone, if a State determined that it could not attain theNAAQS by that date, despite the adoption of all reasonably available measures,the State could request and USEPA could approve an extension of this attainmentdate of up to December 31, 1987. Under these circumstances, each Statewas required to submit by July 1, 1982, a plan (1982 ozone plan) whichassured the attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS by no later thanDecember 31, 1987.\1\<NOTE/> Illinois and Indiana submitted extension requests for NortheastIllinois and Northwest Indiana, respectively, and, thus, were requiredto submit 1982 ozone plans for these areas.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The requirements for an approvable SIP are described ina ``General Preamble'' for Part D rulemaking published at 44 FR 20372 (April4, 1979), and four additional notices: 44 FR 38583 (July 2, 1979), 44 FR50371 (August 28, 1979), 44 FR 53761 (September 17, 1979), and 44 FR 67182(November 23, 1979). Guidance on 1982 ozone SIPs was given at 46 FR 7182(January 22, 1981).Illinois submitted a draft 1982 ozone plan on June 30, 1982. On February3, 1983, (48 FR 5110), USEPA proposed to disapprove the State's plan. Inresponse to USEPA's proposed disapproval, the State submitted numerouscorrections to its draft plan intending to remedy the draft plan's deficienciesidentified by USEPA. On July 14, 1987, USEPA again proposed to disapprovethe Illinois plan. By this time it had become apparent that all controlsrequired by the Clean Air Act would not be adopted and implemented in timeto attain the ozone NAAQS by the December 31, 1987, statutory deadlineor shortly thereafter, and that the Chicago area would not attain the ozoneNAAQS by the same date. On October 17, 1988 (53 FR 40415), USEPA disapprovedIllinois' most recent 1982 ozone plan for the Chicago area.A similar sequence of events occurred in Indiana. Indiana submitted a deficientdraft 1982 ozone plan on September 2, 1982, followed by numerous revisionsintended to remove the deficiencies. USEPA proposed action on these plansseveral times and ultimately disapproved Indiana's most recent 1982 ozoneplan on November 18, 1988, (53 FR 46608).<ITAG tagnum="84">Wisconsin v Reilly</ITAG>In April 1987 the State of Wisconsin filed a suit under Section 304 ofthe Act in the United States District Court for the Eastern District ofWisconsin against Lee M. Thomas, then USEPA Administrator (Civil ActionNo. 87-C-395).\2\<NOTE/> Two counts of the complaint alleged that USEPA had failedto perform a non-discretionary duty to approve or disapprove the greaterChicago area ozone SIPs of Illinois and Indiana. Two other counts requestedthe Court to order USEPA to develop a FIP for the northeastern Illinoisand northwestern Indiana portions of the Chicago-Gary-Lake County (IL),IL-IN-WI Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) within 6 months.The complaint also sought an injunction compelling USEPA to impose andenforce a moratorium on the construction and modification of major stationarysources in the Illinois and Indiana portions of the CMSA. While the litigationwas in progress, USEPA published final disapprovals of the ozone SIP forIllinois on October 17, 1988, and for Indiana on November 18, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Subsequent to William K. Reilly assuming the duties ofAdministrator of the USEPA, William K. Reilly was substituted as nameddefendant for Lee Thomas.The court, on January 18, 1989, ordered USEPA to develop a FIP within 14months. Thus, USEPA is preparing a FIP on a schedule to meet the court'sdeadline, March 18, 1990. The first two significant steps in this effortare the development of an emission inventory for the area and the modelingof the area to determine the level of emission reductions needed to achievethe ozone NAAQS.<ITAG tagnum="84">Emissions Inventory and Modeling</ITAG>In preparing an up-to-date emissions inventory for the Chicago area, andin performing the ozone modeling analyses, USEPA has generally followedthe Agency's proposed post-1987 policy for attainment of the ozone NAAQSand related guidance documents. (See the November 24, 1987, <T4>Federal Register</T4> [52 FR 45044]). Although most of this proposedpolicy addresses the requirements that SIPs must satisfy in order to leadto expeditious attainment of the standards, much of the guidance for developingacceptable SIPs also applies equally well to the development of a FIP.Due to the court ordered 14-month schedule, the Agency was not able towait until it issued a final post-1987 ozone policy before proceeding withthe Chicago area FIP. Reliance on the proposed guidance here to developthe technical data bases for the Chicago FIP does not affect USEPA's determinationas to what may be included in the final post-1987 ozone policy.One way in which USEPA has relied upon the proposed post-1987 ozone policyis in the geographic scope of the area for which emission inventories weregathered and the EKMA modeling conducted. Immediately following the enactmentof Part D in 1977, States typically were required to tabulate such informationonly for areas that were designated nonattainment. In the post-1987 policyproposal, however, USEPA recognized the shortcomings of this approach.The proposal noted that a CMSA or MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Area) bydefinition contains a large urban center together with adjacent communitiesthat have a high degree of social and economic integration. Since manypeople live in the surrounding communities and commute into the urban coreby automobile, suburban vehicles generally are responsible for significantozone precursor emissions. Thus, the Agency proposed that where an ozoneSIP was deficient, it would require all counties within the MSA or CMSAto be included in the planning area (52 FR 45055).The Chicago-Gary-Lake County (IL), IL-IN-WI CMSA contains the followingcounties: Cook DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, and Will Countiesin Illinois \3\<NOTE/>; Lake and Porter Counties in Indiana; and Kenosha Countyin Wisconsin. Thus, emission inventories have been gathered in and EKMAmodeling conducted for all these eleven counties.\4\<NOTE/> In addition, USEPA has included Racine County, Wisconsinfor these purposes, because it is downwind from the CMSA and USEPA believesthat ozone precursor emissions from the counties in the CMSA contributeto the ozone nonattainment problem in Racine County.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ When USEPA notified the Governor of Illinois on Mary 26,1988 that the State's ozone SIP was substantially inadequate to attainthe standard, it noted that the finding of SIP inadequacy applied to theSIP for all these counties. Similarly, when USEPA proposed to redesignatecertain areas as nonattainment pursuant to the Mitchell-Conte Amendmentof December 22, 1987 (contained in the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987,Pub. L. 100-202), it proposed to redesignate all these Illinois countiesas nonattainment for ozone (53 FR 20727, 20729, June 6, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ In addition, emissions from major stationary sources thatemit specified amounts of ozone precursors and are located generally within25 miles of the CMSA have also been included. See discussion, <T3>infra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Emissions Inventory    </ITAG>In order for an effective ozone control strategy to be developed, accurateinformation must be compiled on the significant sources of ozone precursoremissions in and near the nonattainment area. The emissions inventory isused for several functions: (a) As input data for the modeling, (b) inconjunction with the model output to quantify the emission level neededto attain the NAAQS, (c) in the control strategy evaluation and development,and (d) as a basis for tracking progress toward attainment. The proposedcontrol strategy will be set forth in a future rulemaking notice. However,USEPA hopes that these critical uses of the inventory will prompt carefulpublic review and comment. The benefits of an accurate inventory includeenhanced confidence in the data, better representation of model input data,and more reliable control measure evaluations and emissions tracking.   USEPA has developed inventories of volatile organic compounds (VOC) \5\<NOTE/>, oxides of nitrogen (NO<T2>x</T2>), and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from point, area, and RacineCounty, WI, which is adjacent to and predominantly downwind of the CMSAand has been experiencing exceedances of the ozone NAAQS. CO is includedin the emission inventory because recent smog chamber studies indicatethat CO plays a small, but quantifiable, role in ozone formation chemistry.Procedures outlined in the proposed post-1987 ozone policy and in the document,<T3>Emission Inventory Requirements for Post-1987 Ozone State ImplementationPlans, </T3>EPA-450/4-88-019, December 1988, were followed to the extentpossible under the time constraints of the schedule. The baseline emissionsinventory was prepared for a base year of 1988. Projected future year inventorieshave also been developed.    <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ For the purposes of the Chicago area FIP, the term ``volatileorganic compound'' (VOC) means any organic compound which participatesin atmospheric photochemical reactions. This includes any organic compoundother than the following compounds: Methane, ethane, methyl chloroform(1,1,1-trichloroethane), CFC-113 (trichlorotrifluoroethane), methylenechloride (dichloromethane), CFC-11 (trichlorofluoromethane), CFC-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane),CFC-22 (chlorodifluoromethane), FC-23 (trifluoromethane), CFC-114 (dichlorotetrafluoroethane),CFR-115 (chloropentafluoroethane), HCFC-123 (dichlorotrifluoroethane),HFC-134a (tetrafluoroethane), HCFC-14b (dichlorofluoroethane) and HCFC-142B(chlorodifluorethane). These compounds have been determined to have negligiblephotochemical reactivity. For purposes of determining compliance with emission,limits, VOC will be measured by the approved test methods (40 CFR Part60, Appendix A, Methods 25 and 26). Where such a method also inadvertentlymeasures compounds with negligible photochemical reactivity, an owner oroperator may exclude these negligibly reactive compounds when determiningcompliance with an emissions standard.    Point sources have been defined in the inventory to include facilitieswith actual emissions of 10 tons per year (TPY) or greater of VOC, or 100TPY or greater of NO<T2>x</T2> or CO. In addition, major stationary sources that emit 100 TPYor greater of any of these three pollutants and are located outside, butwithin 25 miles, of the demonstration area boundary have been includedin the inventory. (This border area does not extend north of Racine Countyto avoid including another Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area, Milwaukee.)Data for the point source base year inventory were provided to USEPA byeach State air agency, and consist generally of information that the Stateshave been collecting for their own control program and SIP purposes. TheStates updated their existing information in early 1989 through surveyquestionnaires sent to facilities and through recent site inspection reports.USEPA, with contractor assistance, took the States' data and performeddetailed consistency and quality assurance work, as part of the developmentof a single data base.        All significant emission sources, other than mobile sources, that emitless than the threshold for point sources are grouped together by categoryand included in the area source inventory. This inventory concentratesprimarily on small combustion sources, such as boilers and furnaces; evaporativeloss sources, including service stations, dry cleaners, road marking paints,and use of VOC-containing products in the home; and on certain types ofother operations that have been unaccounted for in most previous inventories.These new categories include hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposalfacilities (TSDFs), publicly owned waste water treatment works (POTWs),and municipal solid waste landfills. Data for these categories have beencollected directly from the State agencies where available, as well asfrom local planning agencies, reports of county business patterns, censusfigures, and other specific statistical and summary reports.    Emissions of VOC, NO<T2>x</T2> and CO from mobile sources are a very significant part of thetotal emissions in the Chicago area. USEPA's MOBILE4 model was used tocalculate emission factors for eight individual vehicle types: gasolinelight-duty vehicles (LDVs), light-duty trucks up to 6000 pounds (LDT1s),light-duty trucks between 6000-8500 pounds (LDT2s), heavy-duty vehicles(HDVs), and motorcycles; and diesel LDVs, LDTs, and HDVs.    MOBILE4 incorporates several advanced features and new test data that differfrom previous generations of MOBILE models, including consideration ofrunning evaporative losses, refueling (Stage II) emissions, and effectsof variable fuel volatility (RVP). The output from this model consistsof emission factors in units of grams per mile for each of the vehicletypes. These emission factors were combined with estimates of vehicle milestraveled (VMT) by vehicle type throughout the Chicago area in order toproduce the final mobile source inventory.    The emissions inventory has been summarized and is presented in Table 1for each county in the Chicago demonstration area. The table shows thattotal VOC emissions are 2666 tons per day (TPD), NO<T2>x</T2> emissions are 1948 TPD, and CO emissions are 7249 TPD. The tableillustrates the importance of mobile sources to the overall emission totals,with motor vehicles accounting for approximately 44 percent of the VOC,22 percent of the NO<T2>x</T2>, and 78 percent of the CO emissions throughout the area.   A report presenting the proposed inventory, including the complete methodologyused to create the inventory, is available for review in the rulemakingdocket. The docket also contains the data from which the final inventoryfigures were derived. USEPA solicits any additional or revised emissionsdata. Commentors are encouraged to provide any available emissions datawith their comments.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 1._<T4>State and County Totals for Point, Area and Mobile Emissions Sourcesof VOCs, MO</T4><T2>x</T2> and CO Within the Twelve-County Area \5\<H1>State and County</H1><H1>Point sources (TPD)</H1><H2>VOC</H2><H2>NO</H2><T2>x</T2><H2>CO</H2><H1>Area sources (TPD)</H1><H2>VOC</H2><H2>NO</H2><T2>x</T2><H2>CO</H2><H1>Mobile sources (TPD)</H1><H2>VOC</H2><H2>NO</H2><T2>x</T2><H2>CO</H2>Illinois:<ITAG tagnum="3">Cook</ITAG><D>255</D><D>135</D><D>182</D><D>358</D><D>244</D><D>481</D><D>690</D><D>242</D><D>3,270</D><ITAG tagnum="3">DuPage</ITAG><D>12</D><D>5</D><D>1</D><D>46</D><D>32</D><D>58</D><D>131</D><D>44</D><D>635</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Grundy</ITAG><D>106</D><D>27</D><D>6</D><D>12</D><D>3</D><D>8</D><D>10</D><D>4</D><D>51</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Kane</ITAG><D>19</D><D>2</D><D>1</D><D>27</D><D>16</D><D>29</D><D>51</D><D>16</D><D>278</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Kendall</ITAG><D>3</D><D>11</D><D>1</D><D>4</D><D>3</D><D>8</D><D>8</D><D>2</D><D>45</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Lake</ITAG><D>69</D><D>89</D><D>3</D><D>42</D><D>21</D><D>10</D><D>105</D><D>33</D><D>523</D><ITAG tagnum="3">McHenry</ITAG><D>6</D><D>2</D><D>0</D><D>13</D><D>10</D><D>23</D><D>32</D><D>9</D><D>178</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Will</ITAG><D>49</D><D>207</D><D>24</D><D>40</D><D>12</D><D>29</D><D>58</D><D>20</D><D>301</D><R>n,n,sandCx.3;</R><ITAG tagnum="4">Subtotal<D>568</D><D>490</D><D>221</D><D>542</D><D>341</D><D>646</D><D>1,086</D><D>369</D><D>5,280</D><R>n,n,dandCx.3;</R></ITAG>Indiana:<ITAG tagnum="3">Lake</ITAG><D>240</D><D>187</D><D>421</D><D>52</D><D>88</D><D>64</D><D>27</D><D>17</D><D>111</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Porter</ITAG><D>46</D><D>168</D><D>202</D><D>10</D><D>37</D><D>25</D><D>28</D><D>18</D><D>114</D><R>n,n,sandCx.3;</R><ITAG tagnum="4">Subtotal<D>288</D><D>503</D><D>627</D><D>63</D><D>125</D><D>89</D><D>55</D><D>35</D><D>225</D><R>n,n,dandCx.3;</R></ITAG>Wisconsin:<ITAG tagnum="3">Kenosha</ITAG><D>5</D><D>55</D><D>5</D><D>8</D><D>5</D><D>17</D><D>15</D><D>7</D><D>51</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Racine</ITAG><D>5</D><D>3</D><D>2</D><D>12</D><D>7</D><D>24</D><D>17</D><D>7</D><D>62</D><R>n,n,sandCx.3;</R><ITAG tagnum="4">Subtotal<D>11</D><D>58</D><D>7</D><D>20</D><D>11</D><D>42</D><D>32</D><D>15</D><D>113</D><R>n,n,dandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total FIP area<D>866</D><D>1,052</D><D>855</D><D>625</D><D>477</D><D>776</D><D>1,174</D><D>419</D><D>5,618</D><F>\5\ Subtotal and total emission values also contain emissions from majorstationary sources that emit 100 TPY or greater of any of these three pollutantsand are located outside, but within 25 miles, of the demonstration areaboundary.

The modeling estimated ground level ozone concentrationsby simulating photochemical reactions, and predicted the precursor emissionreductions needed to bring the peak concentrations to the ambient standard.These modeled predictions are an integral part of the development of acontrol strategy for the Chicago area. The model being used for the FIP is EKMA, which is an accepted model inUSEPA's ``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised)'', July 1987 and inthe proposed post-1987 policy for urban-scale demonstrations of attainment.The EKMA modeling was conducted in accordance with USEPA's proposed <T3>Guideline for Use of City-Specific EKMA in Preparing Post-1987 OzoneSIP's. </T3>The <T3>Guideline </T3>breaks down the modeling procedure into five basic steps.These are: (1) Selecting the observed ozone cases to model, (2) Formulating the model inputs, (3) Predicting peak ozone, (4) Computing VOC emission reductions, and (5) Selecting VOC emission reduction targets. In performing the modeling analysis, the five highest daily maximum ozoneconcentrations at each monitor site in the area were selected as candidatesfor modeling. As recommended by the <T3>Guideline, </T3>these five highest values were obtained from the mostrecent 3 years of quality assured data available during which measurementswere made at a site, which were 1986, 1987, and 1988. The sites whose fourthhighest value was not an exceedance of the standard were eliminated fromthose to be modeled. To best accomplish the objectives of the modeling, the model inputs werebased on either the day-specific data or the median of the highest concentrationdays for which complete data were available. However, in some instances,insufficient or inadequate data did not allow such determinations, so approximationsor default values were used. Peak predictions were then compared to observed ozone peaks. In cases wherethe relative deviation was found to be within andplusmin;30 percent, thenagreement was judged to be sufficient to proceed with control estimatecalculations. In cases where the deviation was greater than andplusmin;30percent, model inputs were reviewed and adjusted as directed by the <T3>Guideline </T3>to obtain agreement within andplusmin;30 percent. TheEKMA option in OZIPM4 was used to predict the VOC emission reductions neededto reduce the peak ozone concentration to the ambient standard of 0.12parts per million (ppm). This was calculated on a day-specific and site-specificbasis. A complete report of the modeling methodology and results is containedin the docket and is available for public review. Also available are copiesof the guidance documents used in the analysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">Emission Reduction Target </ITAG>The ozone NAAQS allow one exceedance per year per site. Therefore, theemission reduction target is the fourth highest value from the 3 yearsof monitor data. (If a site had only 1 year of data, then the second highestemission reduction is the target value.) Emission reduction targets forall sites studied were determined in this manner. The highest VOC emissionreduction target for any one site was selected as the overall reductiontarget. This target is a VOC emission reduction of 72 percent. USEPA isproposing a single emission reduction target for the Chicago area. USEPAwishes to emphasize that the actual geographic boundaries, over which thistarget applies, have not yet been determined. Although this issue willbe covered in future proposed rulemaking on the control strategy, USEPAinvites advance comment on the boundaries of the emission reduction targetarea. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Participation </ITAG>USEPA is concerned that the public and affected industries be fully informedabout this planning process and that they have the opportunity for inputand comment. Due to the effect that control measures instituted under aFIP could have on a large cross-section of society, the Agency is encouragingactive involvement of those groups and individuals who wish to participatein the rulemaking effort. Comments on today's notice (and on the supportinginformation in the docket) are being sought and will be considered in promulgatingthis plan. USEPA will also publish a future <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice that will propose and solicit commenton USEPA's overall strategy for assuring the attainment and maintenanceof the ozone NAAQS in the Chicago area, including any new emission controlregulations and measures. USEPA is providing a 30-day comment period onthis portion (i.e., the emission inventory and the modeling analyses) ofthe Chicago area FIP for ozone. The public is requested to comment on themodeling, inventory, and necessary emission reduction in the Chicago FIPas early in the process as possible, due to the very tight schedule forrulemaking. USEPA believes that 30 days is ample time for the public toreview and comment on today's advanced notice of proposed rulemaking. Ifrequested, a public hearing will be held on these matters in the future.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 </ITAG>Air pollution control, Carbon monoxide, Environmental Protection Agency,Hydrocarbons, Incorporation by reference, Intergovernmental relations,Nitrogen dioxide, Ozone.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 16, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Frank M.
