The ordinance, approved 7-2, takes effect Dec. 16.   Mayor Charles J. Luken, a council member who proposed theordinance, praised the council for passing the law over the NRA'spressure. The pressure included a deluge of letters and telephonecalls to council members, and booing and heckling to drown outpeople who spoke in favor of the proposal at the council's publichearing Tuesday.   Richard Gardiner, an NRA assistant general counsel in Washington,said Cincinnati's law appears to be broader than that of some othercities in that it applies to handgun sales by individuals as well asdealers. Gardiner said that without seeing a copy of Cincinnati'slaw, he could not say whether the NRA would try to challenge it inthe courts.   Some other cities and states, including California, also requirewaiting periods before allowing purchase of handguns.   The U.S. House on Sept. 15 rejected a proposed seven-day waitingperiod.</TEXT></DOC>
