(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prosecutors in the Pentagon procurementinvestigation say an initial 27-count indictment is just the startof an expected wave of court activity in the prosecution phase ofOperation Ill Wind.   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson of the Eastern District of Virginiasaid the pace of the investigation that began more than two yearsago is moving with unprecedented speed, given the complexity of thecase.   ``In the next few months you will see a great deal of additionalactivity,'' he said.   On Friday, a federal grand jury filed the first charges in theprocurement case, accusing a defense contractor, a Navy employee andfive other men with crimes including conspiracy, bribery and theftof government property.   Hudson, who is leading the nationwide investigation into theDefense Department's $150 billion-a-year purchasing system, said theindictment ``strikes at the very heart'' of alleged corruption inthe procurement process.   Kenneth Walton, an FBI official, said the ``No. 1 priority'' ofthe bureau's white collar crime program is fraud in the DefenseDepartment.   The 86-page indictment focuses on activities alleged to have beenundertaken by Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif., a branchof Teledyne Inc. of Los Angeles, and three men: Navy procurementspecialist Stuart E. Berlin and private consultants Fred H. Lacknerand William L. Parkin, a former Navy acquisitions official.   Specifically, the indictment charges that Teledyne and three ofits officers agreed to pay Parkin $160,000 to assist them inobtaining a Navy contract related to radar worth $100 million.   The indictment contends Parkin paid Lackner, a California-basedprivate consultant, who ``in turn paid Stuart E. Berlin ... for hisassistance in manipulating the procurement process to insure thatthe ... contract was awarded to Teledyne,'' Hudson said.   Berlin participated in various decisions within the Navyaffecting the contract and is accused of giving Teledyne advanceinformation so the company could tailor its bids, Hudson said.   If convicted of all charges, Berlin, Parkin and Lackner couldface maximum penalties of 185 years in prison and fines of $5.5million each, Hudson told a news conference. Teledyne faces a fineof up to $6.5 million.   Also named in the indictment were Teledyne employees George H.Kaub, Eugene R. Sullivan and Dale Schnittjer. They could faceconfinement ranging between 50 and 85 years and fines of up to $2.5million if convicted on all counts.   The overall conspiracy charge says the defendants worked togetherto defraud the Navy and the Air Force, to bribe a public official,to make false statements and to commit wire fraud.   In advance of the indictment, Teledyne's attorney, Thomas Patten,said the company had been offered a deal by the government but wasunsatisfied with the terms. Attorneys for Parkin and Lackner havecontended their clients did nothing wrong and would be vindicated incourt.   Before the indictment was returned, another company, Hazeltine, adivision of Emerson Electric Co., agreed to plead guilty in U.S.District Court to conspiracy to defraud the United States,conversion of government property and making false statements to thegovernment, company attorney Scott Muller said.   Under terms of the agreement Hazeltine, which is cooperating withthe government, agreed to pay fines of nearly $2 million, includingcourt costs.   Two former Hazeltine employees, Joseph Colarusso, 58, who was thecompany's senior vice president, and Charles Furciniti, 54, who wasa marketing representative, also pleaded guilty to one count ofconspiracy to defraud the government and commit wire fraud.   The maximum sentence they could face is five years in jail and a$250,000 fine. U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton set sentencingfor March 17.   Michael Savaides, 41, an employee of Teledyne Electronics,pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery. He, too, could besentenced to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.   Prosecutors said those pleading guilty had agreed to cooperatewith the government in exchange for reduced charges. All had arelationship with Parkin and Lackner, the consultants who allegedlypaid bribes to Berlin.   Investigators said Hazeltine hired Parkin to obtain insideinformation from Pentagon employees that would allow the company tocompete for a $15.9 million contract for battlefield equipment.   Hazeltine said in a statement that it ``has already takenadditional steps to enforce its longstanding requirement of ethicalbusiness behavior and to guard against such incidents in thefuture.''   Federal agents used telephone wiretaps in the case, which wasfirst made public last June when agents searched offices and homesof people suspected to be involved.   At the Pentagon, defense officials said the Navy is ``reviewingall information released in connection with the indictmentsannounced ... by the Justice Department to determine any necessaryaction regarding Navy programs, personnel, contractors orconsultants.''</TEXT></DOC>
