The United States denied it.   ``There are American-British-Iranian contacts under way forrelease of the hostages,'' said the PLO official, who spoke oncondition of anonymity. The PLO has been informally allied inLebanon with the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia.   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella group for extremistsholding most of the 18 foreigners missing in Lebanon. The hostagesinclude nine Americans. The PLO official said he did not know wherethe contacts were supposed to be taking place.   ``I think this time it's serious because Iran is trying to winover these Western powers by creating an impression it's not Iranthat's hardline, it's Iraq,'' he said in an interview with TheAssociated Press.   Iran and Iraq are trying to negotiate a cease-fire in their war.The talks were deadlocked over Iraq's demand for direct talks.   In Washington, a State Department official, who spoke oncondition of anonymity, said the report was ``false.'' ``There areno direct contacts between the United States and Iran,'' he said.   In the past, U.S. and British officials have denied similarreports about negotiations with Iran on the hostages.   In Beirut, the conservative daily Al-Anwar reported today thattwo British hostages and a West German, all held by pro-IranianShiite Moslem kidnappers, will be released soon. The newspaperquoted the privately-owned Al-Sohofiah newsletter as saying``intense efforts have lately reached agreement on arrangements toset the three hostages free in a short time.''   The names of the three hostages were not reported. Thenewsletter, which has not reported on the hostages before, quotedunidentified sources.   Among those missing, Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite andjournalist John McCarthy are both British, and university professorBrian Keenan holds both British and Irish passports. Britishjournalist Alec Collett was reported killed in 1986, but no bodywas ever found.   The only West German hostage is businessman Rudolf Cordes.   The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
