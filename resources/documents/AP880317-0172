(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Smiling and waving, hundreds of youngparatroopers boarded transport planes Thursday and flew to Hondurasfor training exercises prompted by reports of an incursion byNicaraguan forces.   ``We're 100 percent ready,'' said Lt. Jim Cooper, smearingcamouflage paint on the face of Lt. Steve Swinley as they preparedto leave from neighboring Pope Air Force Base.   ``Give 'em hell,'' added Sgt. Dwight Royal of Fayetteville.   President Reagan on Wednesday night ordered the deployment of aninfantry brigade task force of 3,200 men consisting of twobattalions of the 82nd Airborne at Fort Bragg and two from the 7thInfantry Division at Fort Ord, Calif.   Reagan called the move ``a measured response'' to the Nicaraguantroops movement and to a request for assistance from the Honduranpresident.   The 2,000 combat-ready soldiers from Fort Bragg and 1,200 fromFort Ord were flying to Palmerola, the main center of U.S. militaryoperations in Honduras and about 125 miles west of an area whereheavy fighting was reported Wednesday.   Meanwhile, the Rhode Island National Guard said that 100military police and engineers who had previously been scheduled tofly to Honduras on Friday will go ahead with plans forroad-building exercises despie increased military activity in thecountry. Adjutant Gen. John W. Kiely said the guardsmen will bedeployed far from any potential conflicts between Nicaraguan troopsand the 3,200 U.S. infantry and airborne soldiers.   Troops began leaving Pope shortly after 7 a.m. on the first of26 C-141 planes that were taking off every 30 minutes, said Lt.Gen. John W. Foss, commander of the 18th Airborne Corps. Many ofthe soldiers kissed their wives and girlfriends goodbye atmarshaling points on the sprawling base.   No such farewells were possible for some of the troops at FortOrd who were engaged in an exercise when word came that twobattalions would go to Honduras. Many of the men taking part in thetraining exercise were unable to get in touch with relatives beforedeparting.   ``We've all got swollen eyes, and we're sticking together,''said Karen Brylewski, a civilian base worker who runs a supportgroup for families of servicemen at Fort Ord.   She said she talked to her husband by telephone before he leftand ``he said some of the guys are crying, but everybody has to bestrong. We're just hoping and praying nothing serious comes ofthis.''   From Fort Ord, the troops and supplies were carried on dozens oftrucks to Travis Air Force Base, where the first C-141 lifted offat 11:29 a.m. EST. ``I expect it to go on all day,'' said Air ForceMaj. Wayne Crist.   The first planeload of troops from Fort Bragg arrived atPalmerola at 11:15 a.m. EST in the operation code-named ``GoldenPheasant'' by the Pentagon, according to local radio stationstransmitting from there.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said thecomplete deployment would take about 27 hours.   About 800 of the paratroopers were to parachute into a landingarea about five miles from Palmerola on Thursday night or Fridaymorning, Foss said.   ``This is not a hostile environment,'' he said. ``The area hasbeen cleared for drops.''   The U.S. troops will conduct training exercises with Honduransoldiers, including patrols, small unit training, mock air assaultsand airborne operations, said Maj. Gen. Carl W. Stiner, commanderof the 82nd Airborne Division.   Stiner said the troops were also bringing three lightobservation helicopters, four Cobra gunship helicopters, oneBlackhawk UH-60 helicopter, a command vehicle and ammunition.   He said another combat-ready battalion from Fort Bragg had beenplaced on alert.   As the young soldiers _ the average age is 23 _ began boardingthe C-141s early Thursday, many smiled and waved at televisioncameras and others raised their weapons in the air.   ``If you're going to do it, do it,'' said Sgt. John Jones, whois married with two young children.   His buddy, Mark Kelley, was more philosophical.   ``Let's get the job done and get back home,'' he said. ``Anotherday, another dollar.''   Thursday's operation was the latest opportunity for the 82ndAirborne Division to be called to one of the world's trouble spots.   ``We are the finger in the dike,'' said Fort Bragg spokesman Lt.Col. Rick Kiernan. ``In the event of a crisis, we will fight thefirst 15 days. If there's sustained action, other conventionalforces would be brought in.''   The division's most recent combat mission was in Grenada inOctober 1983, when two brigades were sent to rescue Americanmedical students.   Paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne also saw extensive combatduty in Vietnam, and some 15,000 paratroopers from Fort Bragg weresent to the Dominican Republic during a period of politicalinstability in the early 1960s, Kiernan said.</TEXT></DOC>
