The pending shift in New York City's investment portfolio, which includes the pensions of city employees, teachers, police and fire department personnel, follows a similar move recently by the California Public Employees' Retirement System. Together, California and New York City signal the first major push into foreign bonds by state and municipal money managers. The California system is the nation's biggest public fund with about $42 billion.    &quot;I have no idea how much (of the systems' funds) we'll allocate to foreign markets,&quot; said Robert Pam, director of contracting in the city comptroller's office. &quot;It depends on our trustees in each of the funds.&quot; But some bond specialists say the amount could run into billions of dollars and wind up being the largest non-dollar fixed-income program in the nation. In October 1986, the city reshuffled the management and investment approach of its $17 billion bond portfolios by basing their performance on various domestic indexes.    The city now is soliciting proposals from international fixed-income and equity managers with the aim of matching the investment performance of global bond and stock indexes, such as Salomon Brothers Inc.'s Non-Dollar World Government Bond Index, Mr. Pam said. Dozens of potential managers for the city received a so-called Request for Proposals late last year, an abbreviated copy of which appeared in the classified advertising section of this newspaper last Friday. The proposals are due next Friday.    California selected managers for its foreign investment program late last year and will decide during the next two months the amount of its non-dollar investments. &quot;It could be $1 billion initially and up to 5% of the (system's) funds, or about $2 billion, eventually,&quot; said Greta E. Marshall, investment manager for the state retirement system.    The move into non-dollar bonds by state and municipal pension funds &quot;is one of the most significant investment trends of the 1980s,&quot; said Allan Emkin, a vice president at Wilshire Associates, a financial consulting concern. &quot;There are billions of dollars at stake here,&quot; particularly among firms that produce global debt and equity indexes and among money managers hoping to snare some of the potentially lucrative non-dollar portfolio contracts, he said.    Of a total of about $600 billion in public pension assets, less than $20 billion is invested overseas, Mr. Emkin said.    &quot;A lot of public funds already have commitments to international equities, but only now are they considering (foreign bonds) as an asset,&quot; said Jeffrey L. Skelton, vice chairman of Wells Fargo Investment Advisors, the world's largest manager of index funds with about $53 billion. &quot;There's a lot at stake here because of the inevitable increase in dollars that will flow into foreign bonds. This is a long-term trend.&quot;    The dollar's nearly three-year slump against other major currencies certainly has helped spark growing interest in foreign bond markets. U.S. government securities, battered by the huge federal budget deficit, a weakening dollar and skittish foreign investors, showed the worst returns among the world's major bond markets last year. It was the first time in at least a decade that Uncle Sam's debt finished dead last in the performance tables.    For instance, a basket of U.S. government bonds returned only 1.93% last year, or $19.30 for each $1,000 face amount, according to Salomon Brothers. In contrast, an investor who put $1,000 into a basket of non-dollar bonds Jan. 1, 1987, would have seen that stake grow to $1,351.50 by Dec. 31.    For all of last year, returns on U.S. government bonds significantly lagged behind the British, Japanese, Swiss, Dutch, West German, Australian, French and Canadian government bond markets. Twelve-month returns in these markets exceeded 26%, with the exception of Canadian government bonds, which returned 10.01%. Salomon Brothers measures total return in dollars, based on income and price changes for underlying securities with remaining maturities of at least one year.    &quot;We didn't own any non-dollar bonds, but I wish we had,&quot; said Paul Quirk, executive director of the Pensions Reserves Investment Management Board in Boston, Mass. &quot;Owning non-dollar equities made all the difference last year&quot; for public funds. His fund manages about $2 billion. He doesn't hold out much hope that the current year will be much different than 1987 for dollar bond investors.    &quot;The U.S. government's policy for solving the trade deficit is to ride the dollar down,&quot; Mr. Quirk contends. However, he said the government &quot;will support the dollar to save the election&quot; for the Republicans and &quot;then let it fall to about 100 yen&quot; from 131.10 yen late Friday. &quot;There's no question there will be pressure for higher (U.S.) interest rates and a lower dollar,&quot; he said.    But some analysts say the big public funds are shifting assets into non-dollar bonds just when the dollar may be bottoming out in the foreign exchange market and U.S. interest rates may be heading lower. On Friday, for example, the dollar surged as yields on long-term government bonds declined to their lowest level since mid-July. It was the biggest bond market rally since Oct. 22, according to Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    &quot;Investors should definitely stay in dollar-denominated debt securities this year,&quot; said Dennis Gartman, president of Gartman Financial Services Inc., Portsmouth, Va.-based consultants. &quot;U.S. bonds will be a much better investment than foreign bonds and there are no ifs, ands, or buts about it.&quot;    The possibility of a rebounding dollar and U.S. bond market doesn't disturb California's Ms. Marshall. &quot;The timing of our move may not be appropriate because the dollar may be close to bottoming, but this is a long-term program,&quot; she said. &quot;In the long run, diversification can only help increase the returns in our portfolios while limiting the volatility&quot; of price, income and currency changes for the underlying securities.    Wayne Lyski, a senior vice president and money manager at Alliance Capital Management Corp., which has $9 billion in fixed-income assets, agrees. Although he too is bullish on the dollar and the U.S. bond market this year, the drive into non-dollar bond markets by New York City and California &quot;is a very sensible move,&quot; he said. &quot;In the context of long-term opportunities, this is a strategy that should be undertaken.&quot;    ---                 Lagging U.S. Bond Market              Total returns Jan.-Dec. 1987*    Britain                                46.58%    Japan                                  38.11    Switzerland                            32.59    Netherlands                            32.11    West Germany                           29.38    Australia                              29.00    France                                 26.60    Canada                                 10.01    U.S.                                    1.93    Non-U.S. dolar                         35.15%   Note: Measuring government bonds with remaining maturities of at least one year   *Return includes income and price changes of underlying securities, measured in U.S. dollars   Source: Salomon Bros., Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
