Consumer prices rose 0.4% last month, or at a 5.5% compound annual rate, as the rise in energy costs slowed and apparel prices continued to surge, the Labor Department said. In March, the consumer price index rose 0.4%.    Separately, the Commerce Department said after-tax profits of U.S. corporations fell 5.5% in the first quarter, the sharpest drop since the first quarter of 1986, when profits dropped 9%. The department also slightly raised its estimate of the first-quarter rise in the real gross national product, the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's goods and services, to a 4.4% annual rate from the 4.3% pace it estimated last month.    Among other changes, the department boosted its estimate of the first-quarter increase in a GNP-based price measure to a 4.2% annual rate from a 3.5% pace. In the fourth quarter, this deflator increased at a 0.7% rate.    In another report, the Commerce Department said that new orders for big-ticket factory goods edged up 0.1% in April after rising a revised 4.1% in March. Previously, the department put the March increase at 3.8%. Excluding military orders, however, durable-goods orders fell 0.9% after a 1.3% gain.    &quot;There has been a change in the inflationary environment,&quot; said James Cochrane, chief economist at Texas Commerce Bancshares in Houston, in response to the consumer price report. He said the underlying inflation rate has accelerated a full percentage point from the level maintained over the past several years.    &quot;We're beginning to suffer some of the inflationary consequences of the falling dollar,&quot; said Donald Straszheim, president of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. in New York. A lower dollar makes imports more expensive, giving domestic manufacturers room to raise prices, too.    But both economists said the report doesn't suggest a continued sharp pickup in inflation that would threaten economic growth. &quot;It's 5.5% headed to 5.5%, not 5.5% headed to 8%,&quot; said Mr. Straszheim.    In April, energy prices increased 0.3% after a 1% rise. Gasoline prices were up 0.7% after a 2.3% increase. Food prices increased 0.3% in April after a 0.1% drop in March.    Excluding food and energy, prices were up 0.5% for the second consecutive month. Apparel prices, which tend to be sensitive to import competition, jumped 1.5% after a 1.7% increase. The two-month surge, the largest since a 3.5% rise in the first two months of 1951, reflected the introduction of higher-priced spring and summer merchandise, the department said.    The figures in all the reports are adjusted for seasonal variation. Before adjustment, the consumer price index rose 0.5% to 337.7% of its 1967 average and stood 3.8% above a year earlier.    Beginning with the January figure, the department has revised the index to reflect new consumer spending patterns and population shifts, among other things. For comparison purposes, the department said the old index also rose 0.5% before adjustment in April.    The index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, a measure that includes half the number of people covered by the broader index and is used in adjusting Social Security and retirement benefits, rose 0.5% in March and April. On an unadjusted basis, this index rose 0.5% to 332.3% of its 1967 average and was 3.7% above a year earlier.    On GNP, the department said the increase in the deflator was the biggest since a 4.6% gain in the first quarter of 1984.    The slight revision to economic growth was due to stronger inventory investment and capital spending and less improvement in the nation's trade balance than the department estimated previously. The department said that exports grew, but that imports dropped less than it thought. Also, the drop in consumer spending was bigger than estimated earlier.    The report generally provided support for economists' estimates that growth is slowing markedly from the first quarter. Even before the revision, many contended that the first-quarter inventory build-up was excessive and that a slowdown in inventory investment is now curbing growth.    &quot;Things are a bit weaker than people had thought. It's nothing significant,&quot; said Samuel Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. in Chicago.    The revised increase brought GNP to an annual rate of $3.736 trillion from a $3.696 trillion rate in the fourth quarter. Before inflation adjustment, first-quarter GNP ran at an annual rate of $4.348 trillion, compared with a $4.259 trillion pace.    The slight rise in durable goods orders suggested that the manufacturing sector is continuing to improve in the second quarter, but only moderately. &quot;There's nothing in the data that tells you the second quarter is strong,&quot; said Mr. Cochrane. Priscilla Luce Trumbull, senior economist at Wharton Econometrics in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said, &quot;it's basically a so-so report.&quot;    Orders for transportation equipment fell 7.8% after a 10.8% rise; nonelectrical machinery was down 1.2% after a 2.2% increase. Electrical machinery surged 20.2% after a 3.6% drop. The department said nearly all of the increase reflected defense communications equipment. Primary metals orders were up 6.4% after a 6.8% rise.    Defense orders rose 9.8% after a 42.8% spurt the month before. Non-defense capital goods orders, generally a good barometer of business investment, increased 0.2% after a 1.9% rise in March.    The April rise brought orders to $106.27 billion from $106.15 billion in March. Shipments fell 2.2% to $102.46 billion after rising 1.1% to $104.73 billion. The backlog of unfilled orders gained 1.1% to $362.53 billion after a 0.4% gain to $358.72 billion.    The first-quarter drop in after-tax profits brought them to an annual rate of $136.6 billion from a $144.5 billion pace in the fourth quarter. Before taxes, profits increased 2.7% to a $266.5 billion pace after gaining 8% to a $259.6 billion rate.    The department's measure of profits from current production rose 7.2% to a $333.5 billion pace after rising 3% to a $311.2 billion rate. This figure, which many analysts consider a better gauge of corporate financial health, is adjusted to eliminate the effect of inflation on inventories and to reflect capital depreciation more accurately.    The department's measure of corporate cash flow grew 2% in the latest quarter to a $399.7 billion rate after increasing 0.4% to a $391.9 billion pace.    Separately, the Labor Department said the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers fell 1% in April after adjustment for inflation and seasonal factors. These earnings declined a revised 0.6% in March. Previously, the department said earnings dropped 0.7% in March.    The latest figure reflected a 0.2% drop in average hourly earnings and a 0.3% decline in hours worked.    Weekly earnings of U.S. workers averaged $308.14, after adjustment for seasonal factors but not for inflation, down from $309.72 in March. Before seasonal adjustment, average weekly earnings fell to $306.71 from $307.59.
