Citing unidentified intelligence sources, the magazine said theIsraelis plan first to launch an experimental satellite designed tolast less than a month. If successful, Israel then would put up asatellite with a life-span of about two years.   The magazine said Israeli defense officials are divided overwhether to launch the satellite as soon as possible, or to wait andavoid adding fuel to the region's arms race. The Israeli innercabinet is expected to make a decision within the next few weeks,Time said.   Last summer, the Geneva-based International Defense Reviewmagazine reported that Israel had test-fired a medium-range missilecapable of carrying a nuclear warhead.
