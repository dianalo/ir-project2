Eder, once PaineWebber Inc.'s top stockbroker, was sentenced to six months in prison and fined $510,000 for conspiracy, creating false brokerage records and tax evasion, after the judge scolded him for allegedly breaking his plea agreement with prosecutors.    The sentence was imposed late yesterday both for Mr. Eder's role in a six-year money hiding scheme at a Manhattan PaineWebber branch -- for which Mr. Eder pleaded guilty in March -- and the new tax evasion charge to which he pleaded guilty before sentencing.    The new charge, resulting from testimony Mr. Eder gave at a recent trial of two former co-workers, had &quot;unfortunately sullied&quot; Mr. Eder's cooperation agreement with prosecutors, U.S. District Judge Edmund L. Palmieri said.    The judge, responding to requests for leniency, said a prison term was needed &quot;as a deterrent to those in the financial community&quot; who commit crimes.    Prosecutors in a sentencing letter criticized Mr. Eder for not disclosing to them some $397,480 in illegal deductions for contributions made to various religious groups. In exchange for $496,850 in contributions, Mr. Eder received cash equal to 80% of his checks, but deducted the full amount in his returns. The illegal deductions were disclosed during the recent trial of two co-workers at which one was convicted and one was acquitted of helping Mr. Eder in the scheme.    Mr. Eder was PaineWebber's top broker nationwide from 1982 to 1986, according to the government. He had earned the title of vice president based on his commissions. Mr. Eder left the firm, a unit of PaineWebber Group Inc., shortly before charges were filed in March.    In his March guilty plea, Mr. Eder admitted to helping various customers of the firm hide at least $700,000 from the Internal Revenue Service by avoiding the filing of required currency-transaction reports.    David Spears, the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case, said in the pre-sentencing letter that secret tape recordings Mr. Eder made of customers who &quot;may have violated the tax laws&quot; are being used in a continuing investigation.    Mr. Eder could have received a maximum of 15 years in prison. In addition to prison, Judge Palmieri sentenced Mr. Eder to five years probation, which must include cooperation in investigating charities that &quot;misuse their tax-exempt status.&quot;    Mr. Eder, 42 years old, who produced about $6 million in commissions for PaineWebber in 1986 and earned more than $2.6 million, said he felt &quot;remorse and selfhatred in helping others at the expense of the government.&quot; His attorney, Milton Gould, pronounced the sentence &quot;fair.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
