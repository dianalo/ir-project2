More so than in Washington, expectations are soaring here that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will use the summit to announce either abandonment of the occupation, which enters its ninth year next month, or at least lay the groundwork for a troop pullout next year. Pakistan officials say the Afghan war is entering its end game, to be finished by a single bold move next week or drag on for some time, but still concluding with a Soviet defeat. U.S. officials throw cold water on these hopes, fearing that once more the Soviets will say the right words without changing their actions.    Nonetheless, strategic analysis suggests a convergence of factors that makes an Afghanistan settlement more profitable for the Soviet Union than ever. Expectations of a settlement have been nurtured by Soviet officials seeking to split Pakistan from the U.S., as the American Congress debates a controversial $4.02 billion aid package for Pakistan. And it is fed by Pakistani war-weariness after years of harboring three million Afghan refugees, at a cost to Pakistan of nearly $1 million a day, and what Islamabad calls a KGB-inspired series of bombings that has killed 500 people in Pakistan in the past six months.    Says a Pakistani diplomat, &quot;We've got to get the Afghans {refugees in Pakistan} back to Afghanistan, which won't happen with the Soviets there. If the Soviets can find a way out short of total capitulation followed by the public hanging of all the communists in Kabul, there are definite advantages for them.&quot;    But there remains one potentially insoluble problem: how to insure that a Soviet pullout isn't followed by a bloodbath. Afghan resistance leaders, while badly divided, agree on one major point: The Soviet occupation won't go unavenged.    Talks on a timetable for a withdrawal and the composition of a transitional government have dragged on for five years. But now Pakistani officials, including President Mohammed Zia-ul-Haq, say they are encouraged by recent Soviet declarations and signs of compromise, though President Zia adds that there is &quot;absolutely no indication on the ground&quot; that the 120,000 Soviet troops will be withdrawn soon.    Mr. Gorbachev said in an interview with NBC aired last night that the Soviet Union is looking for a &quot;prompt solution&quot; to the conflict. &quot;If the American administration really does sincerely want that problem to be resolved. . . it could be done very quickly,&quot; he said. Asked how long such a process might take, he replied: &quot;I think we can talk with the president about that.&quot;    U.S. analysts are less hopeful that negotiations can yield a settlement. They say the Soviets will simply have to throw in the towel. &quot;The Soviets want conditions created so they can withdraw their military forces without humiliation while retaining control over the government that's left behind,&quot; says Arnold Horelick, an analyst at the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica, Calif. &quot;They're trying to square a circle and get the U.S. and Pakistan to help them solve a probably insoluble problem.&quot; He adds: &quot;The only remaining question is whether they're ready for a real fiasco, because all current solutions turn into a real fiasco for them.&quot;    That's largely because no acceptable leader of a neutral Afghanistan has emerged. Last summer, a peace initiative fostered by Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chairman Armand Hammer seemed to suggest that former Afghan King Zahir Shah, in exile in Rome, could head a government acceptable to all sides. While a recent opinion poll found that 70% of the Afghan refugees in Pakistan favor the king's return, three of the seven main Afghan resistance groups don't want him.    Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser to President Carter, says he proposed a settlement to the Soviets early in the occupation based on the replacement of Soviet troops by an Islamic peacekeeping force from Algeria and Syria. &quot;Maybe they could take this same idea in adapted form now,&quot; he says. President Zia, too, says he would be happy with such a force, or one under U.N. auspices.    Without a stable government to replace that of current President Najibullah, whose power was confirmed at a meeting of the leadership this weekend that was marred by a shootout between competing factions, analysts say the Soviets risk a humiliating pullout equivalent to the frantic U.S. scramble from crumbling Saigon. Such a retreat would hurt Soviet credibility with friends and clients such as Angola, Cuba and Ethiopia. &quot;If they could somehow navigate a non-humilating withdrawal, that would be a big plus for them, but leaving a disaster behind would outweigh any diplomatic gains,&quot; says Mr. Horelick.    One potential gain is Soviet relations with China. The Chinese have placed three main conditions on closer ties: a withdrawal of Soviet support for Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia, a thinning of Soviet forces on the Chinese border, and a Soviet pullout from Afghanistan. &quot;There's a critical need for the Soviets to get out of the two-front straitjacket: hemmed in by a hostile NATO to the west and a hostile China to the east,&quot; says the Pakistani diplomat. &quot;Giving the Chinese {satisfaction on} Afghanistan, one of the three, shows they're earnest. It also appeals to Western Europe, and greatly increases their freedom to maneuver.&quot;    A pullout from Afghanistan would also send a signal to Iran, which retains the potential to stir up the Soviet Union's vast Moslem population. &quot;Iran is a big factor,&quot; says William Hyland of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. &quot;The game is who ends up as the dominant influence in Iran after the ayatollah dies. But it's very complicated and the Soviets may not know how to play Afghanistan vis-a-vis Iran, whether it's better to go or to stay. They might have better luck trying to broker the Iran-Iraq war.&quot;    Adds Dimitri Simes of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace in Washington: &quot;Getting out of Afghanistan would help with Iran, but it might be easier for the Soviets to wait and see if U.S. policy in the gulf drives Iran into their arms anyway.&quot;    Pulling out of Afghanistan would also remove an irritant that some analysts say has so damaged Soviet credibility with Moslem states as to preclude an effective Soviet role in any future Middle East peace settlement.    A Soviet pullout would affect U.S.-Soviet relations on many levels. The first might be to smooth Senate passage of the intermediate-range missile treaty to be signed at the U.S.-Soviet summit. &quot;Gorbachev knows he's got 23 to 28 firm votes against the treaty, and 34 against beats it,&quot; says a Senate committee aide. &quot;If he's going to pull out soon anyway, what could be better than a dramatic announcement here to line up a few key votes?&quot;    Longer term, a Soviet pullout from Afghanistan would almost certainly worsen U.S.-Pakistan ties. Says a senior policy aide to Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio), who wants to tie further U.S. aid to Pakistan to restrictions on that country's nuclear program: &quot;If the Soviets did start to pull out, the U. S. love affair with Pakistan would evaporate. U.S. aid to Pakistan at such high levels isn't a long-term proposition.&quot;    Adds a State Department official who requests anonymity: &quot;It's clearly Pakistan's strategic imperative to get the Soviets out of Afghanistan and the Afghans out of Pakistan. But, with the war going well, they may not be anxious to end it quickly. It has certain advantages in terms of U.S. money. They won't make concessions to end the war fast.&quot;    President Zia strongly denies any lack of will to see the war end. &quot;Our core interest is these three million {Afghan} refugees. They won't go home until the Soviet Union withdraws, and we've got to get them home.&quot; The war is also opening strains between political factions here, and with the Soviet-inspired bombing campaign affecting many ordinary Pakistanis for the first time since the war started, patience is ebbing.    &quot;The Pakistanis are the nut in the nutcracker,&quot; says a British diplomat. &quot;There are pressures from without to keep the war going, and pressures from within to settle.&quot; The country also faces pressures peculiar to its geography. To its west lies Iran, with which Pakistan retains good relations at the expense of Iraq so that Iran's mullahs don't stir up Pakistan's Shia-Moslem minority. To the east lies India, with which Pakistan has fought three wars in 40 years.    When Pakistan last year asked the U.S. for Awacs or Hawkeye electronic-surveillance planes to ward off Soviet air incursions, India effectively scotched the deal, diplomats say. &quot;The Indians knew Awacs would be used against them, so they got the Soviets to cease the air raids,&quot; the British diplomat says. The Awacs request is on the back burner in Washington.    Given the complexities, is there a solution? An American close to the problem thinks not. &quot;You take the minimal criteria of the Soviets about what they leave behind them, and compare it to the minimal criteria of the Afghan resistance for a withdrawal. If there's an overlap, that's the solution. I see no overlap.&quot;    But President Zia sees hope. &quot;If we are all firm, the Soviets will withdraw, for the first time since they left Austria in 1955. It happens. Miracles happen.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
