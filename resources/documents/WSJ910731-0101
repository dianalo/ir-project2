That little bit ofbusiness is Saddam Hussein.</LP><TEXT>   In what almost seems a rerun of last August's theatrics,the Iraqi dictator is again thumbing his nose at theinternational community and George Bush, with a series ofhalf-truths and taunts in defiance of Iraq's commitment todisclose fully its nuclear facilities and capabilities.   While the Iraqi people suffer both postwar deprivationand, more significantly, Saddam's continuing tyranny, Saddamcontinues alternately to strut and slither with no apparentacknowledgment that he lost one of the most decisive militaryengagements in modern history. Lessons, military orotherwise, are not taught until they are learned. And Saddamclearly remains the recalcitrant student.   So, what are we to do now? Do we move on to hold agraduate seminar on peace for the rest of the Middle East'sunruly students while Saddam is still kicking the teacher inthe shins? Shouldn't we quiet the class bully beforepreaching concord to the rest of the room?   As George Bush embraces Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow, hehas the chance to demand a token of genuine Soviet commitmentto great-power cooperation in return for the many favors theSoviets will be asking of him. What the U.S. should request:a U.S.-Soviet air attack on Saddam's nuclear sites.   It's a small favor compared, for example, to the U.S.going along with the pretense that the Soviet Union is stilla superpower at all by any measurement other than missilethrowweights. It's in Mr. Gorbachev's own interest, since hisfraying empire includes more than 50 million unhappy Muslimsand since Saddam's nuclear weapons, once developed, will becloser to the Soviet Union than to America. It's a modestmeans of making amends for the Soviets' very half-heartedsupport of Operation Desert Storm. And, it's a modest priceof admission to the Mideast peacemaking process for a nationthat has spent the past several decades single-mindedlyseeking to stick it to America throughout the Mideast bysupporting every dictator, terrorist, ideology and causeinimical to U.S. interests and to peace.   It also might have some impact. Imagine the scene: Messrs.Bush and Gorbachev standing together in front of televisioncameras at the Kremlin to announce jointly that as of fiveminutes ago U.S. carrier-based bombers and Soviet land-basedMiGs have taken off in a coordinated assault to destroy onceand for all Saddam's nuclear sites.   That announcement out of the way, the leaders could go onto outline, with considerably more credibility than theycurrently have, their plans for a Middle East peaceconference this fall. Who knows, the rest of the Middle Eastmight then actually pay attention to the second announcementand take a peace conference seriously rather than merely playalong for temporary tactical and publicity advantages.   A demonstration of U.S.-Soviet political and militarypurpose against Saddam certainly doesn't guarantee thatSyria's Hafez Assad or Israel's Yitzhak Shamir will lietogether as lambs in the cozy setting of a peace conference.But the absence of such a demonstration -- with Saddamflagrantly flouting U.S. and international will -- virtuallyguarantees a peace conference will lack lasting substance andresults.   The players at such a conference inevitably see more risksthan rewards in peace-making. While the status quo may beless than ideal, the alternatives can surely be worse. For anAssad, whose rule rests more on Saddamstyle brutality andexternal &quot;threats&quot; (Israel and the U.S.) than on diplomaticcleverness, genuine peace might well end the raison d'etre ofhis rule.   For the Palestine Liberation Organization and assortedPalestinian factions, a Mideast settlement would mean havingto get serious about governance -- perhaps even governancerepresentative of the Palestinian people -- rather thanrelying on the attention-getting theatrics that have been thePLO's primary purpose for decades.   For Jordan's King Hussein, peace always holds the dreadpotential of eventually turning his kingdom into aPalestinian state. For the Saudis, the peace process requiresthat worst of all prospects -- decisions. And for theIsraelis, who for decades have advanced the concept thatpeace is worth the yielding of land, there would now be thegrim prospect of conceivably having to do so. In consequence,Israeli Prime Minister Shamir already is loudly announcingthat the parameters for any peace conference are &quot;peace forpeace&quot; and no longer land for peace.   With all this going against peace prospects, the one slimchance of success rests on the credibility of those conveningthe peace conference. And in the Middle East, credibilitystems from power and the demonstrable willingness to use it.Saddam still offers that target of opportunity.   ---   Ms. House is vice president, international, of Dow Jones andamp;Co.</TEXT></DOC>
