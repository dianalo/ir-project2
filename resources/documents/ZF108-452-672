 By starting with interactive courseware thattrains Japanese businessmen in the intricacies and subtleties of businessEnglish, the six-employee company is aiming at worldwide educationopportunities in subjects as diverse as Rumanian and math.andM;The strategy looks promising.andP;  DynEd recognizes that broad market developmentwill come after business has paid for research and development, buying enoughmachines to drive hardware prices down to public school andconsumer-affordable levels.andM;DynEd's Japanese project is thinly funded, but Sony Enterprise has committed$700,000 mostly in the form of up-front orders.andP;  Sony Enterprises estimatesthat Japanese business spends roughly $800 million annually to trainexecutives to conduct business in English.andM;The current hardware comprises a SonyView system (an AT clone with a '286chip, VGA card and multi-scan monitor), a laserdisc player, CD-ROM player andaudio board--a package that costs more than $6,000.andP;  Even at that price, thesystem makes sense for companies that need to train 10 or more executives.andO;DynEd estimates that its interactive training costs about $9 to $10 per hour,compared with the private Berlitz instructor at $70 an hour.andM;Another opportunity this side of the horizon is in Japanese public schools,where the Japanese Ministry of Education wants to install 400,000 personalcomputers in the next five years.andM;DynEd says it has two important short-term missions.andP;  The first is toeliminate what it admits is its &quot;Achilles heel&quot; -- dependence on a single,not widely installed hardware platform.andP;  The second is to broaden its productofferings.andM;Work on the first goal looks promising.andP;  Discussions are on track withFujitsu and about to start with Tandy.andP;  Though the system requires alaserdisc player and a CD-ROM drive, future products (which have potential inmuch broader markets than the initial offerings) could play on a CD-ROM driveonly.andM;The first four products, Functioning in Business I and II and InteractiveBusiness English I and II, retail as a set for $9,600 through Sony, DynEd'snon-exclusive Japanese distributor.andP;  The set costs $6,000 in the UnitedStates.andP;  The company expects revenue of $600,000 to $900,000 this year.andM;DynEd's CFO, David Welch, laments the current &quot;chicken and egg&quot; marketsituation.andM;&quot;Right now, there isn't enough good courseware available to stimulate salesof hardware ...andP;  and there aren't enough machines to encourage coursewaredevelopment.&quot;andM;Welch plans to be beyond the installed-base bottleneck by 1992, when thecompany plans to have about two dozen courseware packages on the market andrevenue exceeding $5 million.andM;Lance Knowles, president, sees the company's priorities in Asia, Europe andthe United States last.andM;&quot;The U.S.andP;  has no national strategy for education,&quot; Knowles says.andP;  But theEuropeans and Asians do.andP;  That will translate into investment in machines andcourseware--top-down development--which will reduce unit costs and eventuallymake the equipment affordable to consumers.andM;Even if strategy weren't an issue, distribution and support would be.andP;  WhenKnowles tried to float his concept in the United States, he got no more thanthe &quot;We don't want to invent it here; it's way ahead of its time&quot; speech.andM;What he got in Japan was investment from Sony Enterprise, Sumitomo MetalIndustries and KBK Inc., as well as a non-exclusive (!) distributionagreement.andP;  As we spoke a week ago, Welch received a FAX from the Hay GroupItaly, a company representing over 600 Italian firms, that wants DynEd toproduce Italian versions of the current courseware.andM;That may sound like a development strain, but Welch says, &quot;If there are 20blocks in the construction of these programs, 17 don't have to be changed torecast them for a different language when the target language (English)remains the same.&quot;andM;That makes sense.andP;  The principal audio is English, the video is of Englishspeakers.andP;  The &quot;three-blocks&quot; that need modification involve only the audioand graphic &quot;foreign&quot; language pieces.andP;  In fact, there is one applicationbeing considered in the United States that has no &quot;foreign&quot; language module.andO;It's designed for English as a Second Language (ESL) students, people whoalready have some vocabulary, but need help acquiring the more advancedlanguage skills needed in business.andP;  Japanese businessmen taking the standardcourse, by the way, typically have in excess of 1,200 hours of Englishlanguage training before they move the mouse for the first time.andM;The company is reluctant to talk to venture capitalists, preferring to sellup-front orders rather than equity.andP;  Two and a half years into the project,the founders still hold about 75 percent.andP;  Although they are very lean, theyare not talking starvation.andP;  A half-million dollar order (conceivable,considering the interest in language products) would give them a six-month toone-year jump.andM;DynEd is a master of video re-purposing.andP;  The company's alliance withLongman, one of the world's largest educational publishers, gives it accessto video on a royalty basis that would be impractical for a start-up companyto produce.andM;Knowles' vision of turning DynEd into the world's preeminent coursewarecompany is based on Doug Crane's development system.andP;  Crane, a founder andthe director of engineering, has created a program that allowsauthor-educators to produce courseware.andP;  Very little programming knowledge isrequired to use Crane's tools to produce a wide variety of course materialincluding math, which mathermatician Knowles sees as a language-like skill.andO;Though the company has considered licensing the software to other developers,for the moment it intends to maintain a monopoly on titles.andP;  They believe(and we agree) that content products will eventually be the big money makers.andO;They're in on floor one nad they're wisely not eager to let anyone else inthe elevator.andM;Introductory courses use a great deal of video, while the more advancedInteractive Business English uses graphis and animation extensively.andP;  Afterexperiencing it, we agree that depicting the elements of language structureis most effective using simpler graphics, while showing body language andexpression in full motion (and very high quality) video is essential inportraying the cultural context.andM;One thing is very evident after &quot;participating&quot; in this program.andP;  Theauthor-teacher will be the preeminent player in the courseware industry.andP;  Itappears that Knowles has accounted for every response a student could make --even ones that make no sense, ones that might be a result of trying to &quot;beatthe machine.&quot;andP;  The system responds like the very best tutor, staying ahead ofthe student when he is advancing rapidly, coaching on points with which hehas difficulty, even asking, &quot;Are you there?&quot; if there is an extremely longdelay in responding.andM;Knowles is a teacher with a world vision.andP;  If he can achieve that vision, theindustrial countries (at first) can have quality teachers in every classroom,teachers that know their subjects, understand their students, never get tiredor irritable and never (at least at this level of interactivity) whack theircharges with a ruler.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
