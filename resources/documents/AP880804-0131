In the Northeast, it was so hot that HarvardUniversity planned to close for the first summer weekday in 352years.   Showers and thunderstorms ranged across central Arizona,northeast Colorado to northern New Mexico, southern Texas, Kansasto southern North Dakota, western Tennessee into southern Missouriand Arkansas, as well as across the Southeast and eastern GulfCoast, and the upper Great Lakes.   Near Detroit, gusty winds and small hail accompanied athunderstorm, while lightning, hail, high winds and record amountsof rainfall pounded northeastern Colorado late Wednesday and earlyThursday. At least five mobile homes were torn off theirfoundations in Fort Collins, and 12 people suffered bruises afterthey ran from an office building into pounding hail.   The Northeast and Great Lakes region continued to bake, withMadison, Wis., reaching 90 degrees or above for the ninth day in arow. Temperature records for the date were broken or tied in GrandRapids, Mich., where a reading of 95 tied the Aug. 4, 1947,temperature; Lansing, Mich., where a high of 96 tied the 1881reading; Madison, where the old mark of 96, set in 1947, was brokenby one degree; and Portland, Maine, where the high of 89 tied the1944 reading.   But Madison got quick relief from a thunderstorm, which cooledit down to 85 in 20 minutes.   The oppressive heat and bad air quality, blamed on a lingeringBermuda high, prompted Harvard University to give summer students athree-day weekend by canceling classes Friday, said Peter Costa, aspokesman for the Cambridge, Mass., school.   The school is known to have shut down only once before, duringthe blizzard of 1978, he said.   ``Not all of Harvard is air conditioned,'' he explained. ``Wethought we'd give our students and staff a three-day weekend untilthings cool off.''   In New York, the muggy heat shattered power-use records andforced the rescheduling of track and field events at the EmpireState Games. Thursday was the 20th day this summer of above90-degree temperatures, according to the National Weather Servicein Albany, N.Y. The average is about eight for the summer, saidmeterologist Robert Barton.   The Hudson River was so warm that Con Edison expressed concernabout the ability of the water to effectively cool the Indian Point2 nuclear power plant in an emergency, a spokesman said.   On Wednesday night and early Thursday, the river's temperaturereached 85 degrees, prompting notification to the NuclearRegulatory Commission of an ``unusual event,'' spokesman MartyGitten said.   ``This is not a problem in normal operations,'' he said. But asa precaution, the utility has lowered the plant's power output from885 megawatts to 500 megawatts.   Illinois conservation officials expressed concerned about thegrowing number of fish kills in rivers and ponds drained of oxygenby high temperatures.   About 2,000 catfish, carp, drum and white perch died near RockFalls in the Hennepin Canal in July, thousands more died in theIllinois andamp; Michigan Canal near La Salle and more than a hundreddead fish were discovered along the Mississippi River north ofCordova recently, they said.   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55degrees at Crescent City, Calif., to 106 at Palm Springs, Calif.   The forecast for Friday called for showers and thunderstormsextending from northern New England across the Great Lakes andsouth and west into western Tennessee and the Appalachians, withother showers from the south Atlantic coast to the lowerMississippi Valley, over southwest and central Texas, and overparts of Missouri, Kansas, northern Arizona and notheast Nevada.   High temperatures will be in the 90s or near 90 degrees overmuch of the nation. Highs in the 70s and 80s will extend from theGreat Lakes across the upper half of the Mississippi Valley, thecentral Plains and southern Colorado and northern Arizona, andalong the northern Pacific coast.</TEXT></DOC>
