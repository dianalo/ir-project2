As previously reported, the computer maker charged in its suit, which was filed in federal court in New Hampshire, that Emulex's computer disk and tape drive products infringed certain Digital Equipment patents.    In 1986, Emulex filed a lawsuit against Digital Equipment in a California state court, alleging that the company had violated contracts to provide Emulex with computer products and services.    Both suits were dismissed as part of the settlement, Digital Equipment said. Terms of the settlement also call for Emulex to license certain Digital Equipment technologies for an undisclosed sum. </TEXT></DOC>
