Mr. Poindexter, who was sentenced in federal court here,was the first of the Iran-Contra defendants to receive aprison term. He was also the most senior Reaganadministration official tried and convicted on charges ofconcealing U.S. arms sales to Iran and White House supportfor the Nicaraguan rebels during a period when Congress hadbanned such aid.</LP><TEXT>   Explaining his decision, Judge Harold Greene said thatincarcerating the retired Navy admiral would deter other highpublic officials from misleading Congress. Failing toimprison Mr. Poindexter &quot;would be tantamount to a statementthat to lie to and to obstruct Congress was of no greatmoment,&quot; Judge Greene said. Mr. Poindexter declined to make astatement when given the opportunity by the judge.   Mr. Poindexter will remain free while he appeals hisconviction on five felony counts of making false statementsto Congress and obstructing the inquiries of lawmakers intothe Iran-Contra affair. He was sentenced to serve six monthsin prison for each of the counts, but the terms will beserved concurrently. Judge Greene didn't impose a fine.   The judge had wide discretion in determining the sentencebecause Mr. Poindexter's actions took place before theNovember 1987 effective date of federal guidelines that wouldhave made a prison term mandatory for such felonies.   Mr. Poindexter's prison sentence pulls a reluctantPresident Bush back into the biggest White House scandalsince Watergate. Mr. Bush, who has attempted to play down hisrole in the Iran-Contra affair as Mr. Reagan's vicepresident, must now decide whether to pardon Mr. Poindexter.A Bush spokesman said the president wouldn't immediatelycomment on the sentence.   Mr. Poindexter's attorneys, who maintain that he didn'tbreak any laws, had asked Judge Greene to consider theirclient's previously stellar Navy career and not give him aprison term.   Prosecutors from the office of Independent CounselLawrence Walsh had sought a prison sentence as a warning thatexecutive branch officials must tell Congress the truth.After the court proceeding, Dan Webb, the lead trialprosecutor, called the result &quot;very fair and very proper.&quot;   Leading Iran-Contra defendants who were spared prisonterms despite convictions include Robert McFarlane, anotherformer national security adviser who pleaded guilty to fourmisdemeanors of withholding information from Congress, andOliver North, a mid-level national security aide who wasconvicted of three felonies, including helping to obstructcongressional inquiries. Both men were sentenced to twoyears' probation, as well as being forced to pay fines and docommunity service.   Prosecutors in the Poindexter trial argued successfullythat previous Iran-Contra sentences shouldn't preclude prisontime for Mr. Poindexter.   Some criminal law experts agreed with this position. &quot;I'mnot surprised by the sentence,&quot; said Samuel Dash, the chiefcounsel to the special Senate Watergate Committee and now alaw professor at Georgetown University. &quot;Here was somebodywho went to trial and was right next to the president,&quot; Mr.Dash said. In contrast, Mr. McFarlane admitted his guilt andMr. North was &quot;a middle-ranking&quot; official, &quot;not one of thebosses,&quot; Mr. Dash added.</TEXT></DOC>
