Robert Wallach, awaiting trial onracketeering charges in the Wedtech bribery case, said today he wasan innocent man victimized by the media and investigators out todrive former Attorney General Edwin Meese III from office.   Wallach, at a news conference at the National Press Club,defended his longtime friend, saying Meese had received more``calumny from the American media'' than any public official inmemory.   ``I am persuaded that much of what went on was an effort todrive Ed Meese from office. ... I proved to be a most attractivevehicle to help accomplish that goal,'' said the San Franciscotrial attorney.   He said he had made some ``honest mistakes'' in Washington. ``Ithink I came into the big leagues thinking I had had adequatespring training when I hadn't,'' he said.   ``I'm telling you the sytem caught an innocent man and the mediaplayed a role in it,'' said Wallach.   ``The Bob Wallach that was portrayed in The Washington Post, inThe New York Times, in most publications which covered me ... neverexisted, does not exist, did not exist,'' he said.   ``I had on one side of me Wedtech and on the other side of meEdwin Meese III. How could I not have been an attractive object forthe media?'' said Wallach, who complained that his life and thelives of his children had been invaded by ``the anonymous assassinsof the media.''   He depicted himself as a self-made man, grandson of abutton-hole maker who won a scholarship and worked his way throughcollege to become a pillar of the San Francisco bar and backer ofliberal causes.   Wallach lodged the same complaints Wednesday night at anAmerican University forum, where he told 300 people, ``I wasconvicted before I was indicted. I was convicted by the Americanmedia.''   Wallach goes on trial Jan. 3 in New York on federal racketeeringand conspiracy charges.   Wallach is accused of taking payoffs from Wedtech officials toinfluence Meese and other public officials. Wedtech was a fledglingdefense contractor and favorite of the Reagan administration thatcollapsed in a bribery scandal in 1986.   Joining Wallach on the American University panel were LynNofziger, the former White House political director who isappealing his conviction for illegal lobbying, and two reporters.   Wallach said he would not ``back one inch away'' from themedia's First Amendment freedom, but that ``does not give themauthority to desecrate the Sixth Amendment right: the presumptionof innocence.''   Meese resigned as attorney general last month, shortly before aspecial prosecutor decided not to indict him.   Wallach claimed that special prosecutor James McKay's only goalwas to drive Meese from the attorney general's office, and ``Ibecame an appropriate ... vehicle to help to accomplish that.''   Nofziger, sentenced to 90 days in jail and a $30,000 fine forillegally lobbying former White House colleagues, said somereporters are careless, but he received fair coverage at his trial.   ``You can't point a finger at the profession,'' he said.   Ruth Marcus of The Washington Post and James Polk of NBC Newsboth said the press had no power to indict or convict anyone.   Polk said Wallach's problems stemmed from his indictment and thespecial   But Polk said he personally feels the press ``has fostered anassumption of guilt on the part of Bob Wallach before trial.''Polk, who said juries often begin with the assumption that adefendant is guilty, also expressed the opinion that Nofziger ``wasunfairly convicted.''</TEXT></DOC>
