The House Energy and Commerce Committee voted 36-7 toapprove legislation that would bar the administration fromimplementing the rule until the next fiscal year, whichbegins Oct. 1. Similar legislation has been introduced in theSenate, which has taken no action on it yet.</LP><TEXT>   The rule, which the administration currently is refining,is scheduled to take effect Jan. 1. It would deny federalmatching funds for most revenues raised by state taxes onhospitals and other institutions that provide servicesthrough the Medicaid program, the joint federal and statehealth program for poor people. It also would eliminatematching funds for all donations to the program from Medicaidproviders.   Federal officials have called such financing arrangementsa scam because the state revenues raised from providers arereturned through higher Medicaid reimbursements. In effect,the federal officials argue, the revenues serve only as loansto lure more federal dollars.   But states say they are collapsing under the strain ofpaying for Medicaid and will have to cut services if theyaren't allowed to continue raising money through providers.Thirty-nine states stand to lose money under the rule.</TEXT></DOC>
