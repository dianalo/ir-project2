STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The West German government said Mondayit has approved the sale of Texaco Inc.'s West German subsidiary tothe utility Rheinisch-Westphaelische Elektrizitaetswerk AG.   The Federal Cartel Office determined that RWE ``would not securea controlling monopoly of the market with the purchase,'' saidHubertus Schoen, a spokesman for the office.   RWE, West Germany's largest utility and its eighth-largestcorporation, is active in the production and supply of electricity,coal mining and the petroleum and chemicals businesses.   Texaco announced June 6 it had agreed to sell its West Germansubsidiary Deutsche Texaco AG to RWE for $1.23 billion as part ofthe U.S. company's $5 billion restructuring plan. The sale wassubject to West German government approval.   Schoen also said the office would not stand in the way of aproposal to allow Norway's state oil company, Stat-oil, to have astake in the new RWE unit.   RWE officials say an association with Stat-oil would boost RWE'srefining sector earnings. Stat-oil could supply crude oil to theWest German market and also use its refineries to supply thatmarket with oil products, officials said.   The officials said the company will include the Texacosubsidiary into a newly-formed unit, RWE Mineral Oil and ChemicalCorp.   Deutsche Texaco is active in all phases of the oil business,from exploration and production to petrochemicals. It owns tworefineries, capable of producing 140,000 barrels daily, and holds a10.2 percent share of the West German retail gasoline market, withabout 1,900 Texaco-branded retail outlets throughtout the country.   Deutsche Texaco currently employs about 4,200 workers.</TEXT></DOC>
