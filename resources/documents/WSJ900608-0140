Nyet   ----   By Walter Clemens Jr.</HL><DATE>06/08/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A10</SO><CO>   FREST</CO><LP>   Gone is Nikita Khrushchev's boast that the Soviet peoplesare &quot;merging&quot; and Leonid Brezhnev's claim that they are atleast &quot;converging.&quot; The Soviet Union is no melting pot. Thisconclusion fairly leaps from comparisons of the 1979 and 1989census figures in the official yearbook.   The U.S.S.R.'s total population grew 9% in the 1980s, to286.7 million in 1989. The Moslem republics grew much fasterthan the European: Uzbekistan, Turkmenia, Kirghizia andTadzhikistan grew 22% to 34%; Azerbaijan, 17%; Kazakhstan,13%. The European, traditionally Christian regions grew atless than the Soviet average: the Russian Republic,Byelorussia and Estonia by 7%; Latvia, 6%; the Ukraine, 4%.</LP><TEXT>   Few Central Asians move to the Russian countryside, whichis badly in need of strong young workers. Instead, CentralAsia's already overcrowded rural communities are becomingstill more populous, a trend aggravated by military forcereductions. Since Central Asians don't move around much, theyintermarry very little with other ethnic groups. In fourCentral Asian republics roughly 95% of the natives marryother natives. Even though more Russians than Kazakhs live inKazakhstan, Kazakhs still tend to marry other Kazakhs.   There is a trend away from intermarriage across the SovietUnion. In the Baltic states, as in Central Asia, the share ofin-group marriages has increased since 1978. In Lithuania, itis up to 94% from 92%; in Estonia, to 91% from 90%; inLatvia, with the lowest rate of the Soviet republics, suchmarriages increased by slightly less than 1%, to 80%. Nearlyall Armenian men living in Armenia marry Armenian women --98%. Even in the Russian Republic, which draws students andworkers from many parts of the country, roughly 90% ofRussian men marry other Russians. In Russia as in most of therepublics the ratio of women marrying their own nationalityis slightly lower than these figures for men.   Some minorities do not hold their own. Tatar males, livingin their own &quot;Autonomous Republic&quot; enveloped by Russia, marrytheir own kind only 61% of the time -- down from 70% a decadebefore. The shrinking number of Jews creates pressure on thatgroup too for intermarriage: Only 27% of Jewish men in theRussian Republic marry Jewish women -- down from 41% in 1978.   Unlikely to marry each other, Soviet citizens are growingapart in other ways too. European Soviets are becoming morecitified. The most urbanized republics are the Russian (74%),Estonian (72%) and Latvian (71%), while the Central Asianrepublics and Moldavia are only 33% to 47% urban. Of the 29cities with more than a million residents, only five havemany Moslems: Tashkent, Baku, Alma-Ata, Kazan and Ufa.   The predominately rural women of Central Asian are alsoextremely fertile. They have about five children on theaverage, compared with just over two in Byelorussia, theUkraine, the Baltic and Russian republics. The more urbanizedEuropean regions are likely to have low or no populationgrowth, while Central Asia's soars. Government subsidies forlarger families have spurred fertility slightly in someEuropean republics, but the trend line for Central Asia hasshot off the chart.   The same rural poverty that leads Central Asians to haveso many children also shortens their life spans. As of 1989the average Soviet citizen lived to 69.5 years (64.8 for theaverage man, and 73.6 years for the average woman, despiteher many chores). As Moscow's demographers acknowledge, theaverage life span in the Soviet Union is five to eight yearsshorter than it is in the U.S., Western Europe and Japan.Comparisons for Turkmenia, Moldavia, and Kirghizia are evenless favorable: their life spans average only 66 to 68 years.   Soviet authorities now also admit that mortality ratesincreased throughout the U.S.S.R. in the second half of the1960s and throughout the 1970s, as rampant alcoholism led toindustrial accidents and other health problems. The StateCommittee makes the dubious claim that the anti-alcoholcampaigns started in mid-1985 quickly produced a 1.8-yeargain in average Soviet life spans, but it concedes that thesegains, whatever they were, halted after early 1986.   Moslem Central Asia suffers less from alcoholism thanEuropean Russia, but much more from infant mortality: InTadzhikistan at least 49 of 1,000 children die in their firstyear, compared with 11 in Latvia and 19 in Russia. The Sovietaverage is 24.7 per 1,000 -- still 2.5 to five times higherthan in many &quot;developed capitalist countries,&quot; the StateCommittee says, complaining that Soviet figures have shownlittle improvement in the past decade.   In principle the Soviet Union should be able to draw uponthe strengths of Europe, Asia and the Transcaucasus; on thetraditions of Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism andother religions; on cultures as diverse as Georgian andMongolian. In practice this diversity yields not synergy butentropy.   ---   Mr. Clemens teaches at Boston University and is an adjunctresearch fellow at Harvard.
