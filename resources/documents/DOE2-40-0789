Based on the theory of infrared radiativetransfer in a plane-parallel atmosphere, this simulation computed thevertical distribution of the change in longwave radiative heating ratesthat occurs as a result of doubling atmospheric methane. The interactionof methane with other atmospheric constituents which are optically activewithin the spectral boundaries of the absorption band for CH{sub 4} wasconsidered in the analysis of the results. The radiative interactionbetween water vapor and increased methane was shown to be the dominantreason for a positive change in heating rates in the lower tropospherewhen methane is doubled.</TEXT></DOC>
