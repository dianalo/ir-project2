It was in such a state ofdecay that every business on the commercial strip exceptthree -- a bank, a bakery and a music store -- was boardedup.   But Homewood has been making a comeback, a Phoenix risingfrom the ashes. Today, a slew of new townhomes have replacedmany of the rubble-strewn lots; brightly lit storefronts havereplaced some burned-out shells. All are the work of theHomewood-Brushton Revitalization and Development Corp., anon-profit agency headed by Mulugetta Birru.                                                                                                          Mr. Birru, an Ethiopian-born banker, is one of thenewfangled community activists who have been quietly makingimpressive strides in revitalizing the nation's inner cities.&quot;I was absolutely in awe,&quot; says James Caliendo, an executivewith Landmark Savings Association, who visited Homewood thisspring.   An estimated 1,500 to 2,000 so-called communitydevelopment corporations work in such varied cities as Miami,Indianapolis, Baltimore and Chicago. The groups, known asCDCs, are an unusual blend of public and privatepartnerships. Typically, they work out of bare storefronts onshoestring budgets and with tiny staffs. They scrape togetherfinancing for their development projects through acombination of government funds, private donations,foundation grants and low-interest bank loans. They are runat the grassroots level, by the communities themselves.   &quot;This is a new wave,&quot; says Paul Brophy, the head of theEnterprise Foundation, one of a handful of national groupsestablished to assist neighborhood-based developers. &quot;It's amovement that's here to stay.&quot;   The groups have sprung up to deal with a critical shortageof affordable housing. A recent study found that 4.8 millionpoor families pay more than 50% of their income for rent. Andwhile private investors have shied away from distressedcommunities, the CDCs have worked small wonders. In Goshen,Ind., a town of 23,000, a CDC rehabilitated 22 rental unitsfor farm workers who settled there. It now hopes to &quot;rehab&quot;10 to 15 dwellings to sell to first-time homeowners.   In Newark, N.J., the non-profit New Community Corp. ownsan estimated $200 million worth of real estate, including anew shopping mall. And in Boston, a consortium ofneighborhood developers has rehabilitated 2,000 units oflow-income housing. &quot;These are not just do-gooders; they'resophisticated builders,&quot; says Peter Dreier, housing policyadviser to Boston's mayor.   In the past five years, the number of CDCs has increasedfivefold. A big help was the 1988 tax act, which providedincentive for corporations to invest in CDCs in exchange fortax credits. The 1990 National Affordable Housing Act alsoprovided a boost by targeting between $100 million to $300million for CDCs. Nonetheless, money is in short supply. Someargue that this is an ideal time for the federal governmentto recommit itself to the inner city, using CDCs as a kind ofconduit for new investment. &quot;It fights poverty, it activatescommunity residents; it's a marvelous thing that has slippedquietly into place,&quot; says Paul Grogan, president of the LocalInitiative Support Coalition, which has built an equity fundfor CDCs. &quot;The CDCs are giving plenty of indication of howwell they can operate.&quot;   Pittsburgh, with about 30 non-profit neighborhood groups,has made them the centerpiece of its housing and neighborhoodeconomic development strategy. And Homewood-Brushton is itscrown jewel.   The neighborhood, which is one of the few flat parcels ofland in this steep-hilled city, sits on the city's east side.At the turn of the century it attracted a fashionable crowd,including Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick and GeorgeWestinghouse. The Depression and then suburban growth wroughtvast changes. First, the larger homes were converted toapartment buildings. Then between 1950 and 1980, as peopleleft the city, the population plummeted by nearly half to15,000; the neighborhood also changed from predominatelywhite to almost entirely black.   By the time Mr. Birru arrived in 1984, it was indisrepair. After he agreed to head the newly formedHomewood-Brushton Revitalization and Development Corp.,residents drove him through the neighborhood. Row upon row ofabandoned buildings on the first two commercial blocksgreeted him. &quot;I was stunned,&quot; he recalls.   Then he visited the local Chamber of Commerce office. Theupstairs windows were shattered. The bent front door barelyclosed. At that point, Mr. Birru reconsidered his decision.&quot;Immediately I told them that unless you guys become thedevelopers, nothing is going to happen in Homewood,&quot; he says.The 27-member board of Homewood-Brushton, made up mostly ofcommunity residents, agreed. Mr. Birru took the job.   A congenial, soft-spoken man, who dresses in tailoredsuits and requires the men on his staff to wear ties sothey'll look professional, Mr. Birru has helped engineer thegrowth of this CDC from an organization with an annualoperating budget of $130,000 to $700,000 today. And he hasquieted the skeptics, including a government official who in1984 told him no one would ever build anything in Homewood.   In the first few months, Mr. Birru saw comparisons betweenHomewood and the Third World. Market forces had failed both.Many people in both places had low self-esteem and a deepdistrust of outsiders. Some residents, convinced Mr. Birruhad actually been hired by the city to gentrify thecommunity, shouted him down at meetings and, at one point,demanded his ouster.   But in Ethiopia, where Mr. Birru had been a senior bankingofficial with the former Marxist government's Agriculturaland Industrial Bank, he had learned to avoid responding toprovocation for fear that he might lose his life. &quot;That's theskill he brought to the Homewood community,&quot; says formerassociate director Matthew Hawkins, who recalls many meetingsat which Mr. Birru's quiet patience and level head silencedhis critics.   One of Mr. Birru's first projects was the construction of27 townhomes. With an interested developer in tow, he madethe rounds of city officials and local banks to raise money.When he met with an official in the housing department, hewas told that the neighborhood groups would just fight amongthemselves and wreck each other's efforts. &quot;The privatedeveloper,&quot; recalls Mr. Birru, &quot;just abandoned it on thespot.&quot; Two years later, a patient Mr. Birru found anotherdeveloper and got the townhomes built. He's now about tobreak ground on another 26 townhomes and is rehabilitating 18single-family houses.   Beverly Paplin, a 39-year-old clerk typist with a localutility, is saving to buy one. Two years ago, she and her twosons, ages seven and 15, moved into a three-bedroomapartment, one of 45 renovated by Homewood-Brushton. &quot;What'samazed me is how fast things change. I come home from workand it seems like buildings are being erected,&quot; says Ms.Paplin. When she tells friends she moved to Homewood, theyask her if she isn't scared to live there. &quot;I hope somedaythey're envying me,&quot; she says.   Ms. Paplin, Homewood-Brushton should build more than justhousing. His experience in Ethiopia taught him that only thecombination of housing and business development would createthe &quot;little village&quot; atmosphere he desired. He figured thebest place to start would be to attract a fast-food franchiseto serve as a magnet for other business. So he sent 200letters to potential developers. He had what he thought was aprime corner location. Only one fast-food chain said it mightbe interested, but it quickly retreated.   Mr. Birru had his organization purchase the property for$300,000, using a potpourri of resources, including two bankloans, a foundation grant and a city subsidy. Eventually, aminority-owned Dairy Queen franchise opened on the site,which, despite lender protests, chose not to use bulletproofglass to build a solarium. While the hardest object thrownagainst the window has been an egg, on Halloween, the DairyQueen has yet to turn a profit. &quot;But we're doing better eachyear,&quot; says franchisee Neil H. Dorsey.   Today, Homewood-Brushton owns nearly half of theneighborhood's four-block commercial strip, which now housesnumerous small businesses, including a minority-owned shoestore, barber shop and corner market. Ms. Paplin's two boysbuy groceries at the market, get their hair cut a fewbuildings down from their home, buy shoes at a new Athlete'sFoot store and play basketball at the YMCA across the street.&quot;I was in a slump where I was before,&quot; says Ms. Paplin. &quot;Herewe can breathe. I want to be involved in the community. Iwant to be a part of it. I feel pumped.&quot;   Adds Sara Trower, owner of Trower's cleaners, and one ofHomewood-Brushton's board members: &quot;We're dancing to our tuneand to nobody else's.&quot;   Not every community development corporation in Pittsburghhas done so well. On the city's north side, a group of singlemothers has tried to raise the funds to rehab a three-blockstretch of once-handsome row houses. Jack Kemp, the secretaryof Housing and Urban Development, called their efforts &quot;amodel for urban areas over America.&quot; Yet the group has beenunable to raise the necessary $335,000, though it hasreceived enough money to buy out two nuisance bars with theintent of converting one into a laundromat and the other intoa day-care center.   Even success has spawned problems. Young professionals nowwant to move into some of these revitalized communities, andthe fear is that such a migration will push rents and homeprices out of reach for low- and moderate-income families.The Bloomfield-Garfield Corp., which owns 20 units of housingas well as five commercial properties in a working-classcommunity, considered renting a vacant storefront to avegetarian restaurant, a move that some saw as a prelude tosushi bars and art galleries.   &quot;We're desperate&quot; for a tenant, concedesBloomfield-Garfield's director of development, Rick Swartz,who later suggests that &quot;if there's a quiet gentrificationgoing on, it's going on without displacing anyone.&quot; Theprospective tenants have since decided to go elsewhere; thestorefront still stands empty.   But perhaps the greatest indicator of how far these CDCshave come is their evolving relationship with the bankingcommunity. Only three or four years ago, many neighborhoodactivists were raising hell, angered by alleged red-lining bythe banks. Mr. Swartz accompanied the owner of a smallbusiness who had been denied a loan to the offices of onebanking executive; they threatened a boycott if the loanwasn't granted. Armed with the Community Reinvestment Act of1977, which in effect requires banks to make loans inpreviously red-lined areas, neighborhood groups confrontednumerous other lending institutions as well.   Relations have changed. Mr. Swartz and Mr. Birru now areon a first-name basis with local bank chairmen. Some bankingexecutives, who have found unusually low default anddelinquency rates among the city's CDCs, regularly visit theneighborhoods, scouting areas in need of loans. &quot;To me theCDCs are the only viable answer,&quot; says Edward Randall, anexecutive at Pittsburgh National Bank. &quot;Maybe you don't makea lot of money, but you get a return and it's an investmentin the neighborhood's future.&quot; A few months ago, the city'sCDCs threw a luncheon to honor the banking community'snewfound faith in neighborhood development.   But more than just money is at stake. CDCs have gonebeyond traditional economic development. Some offer jobcounseling. Others provide tutoring and recreationalactivities for youth.   With the hope of building community self-esteem, Mr. Birruplans to venture further into uncharted waters.HomewoodBrushton recently bought an AM religious radiostation for $225,000. Mr. Birru plans to convert it to anall-talk format, mostly on issues relating to the inner city.Fighting the negative perception &quot;is sometimes more importantthan the housing and business development when we talk aboutrevitalizing the community,&quot; says Mr. Birru, who expects togo on the air this fall.   Even in more conventional development, Mr. Birru findsways to rebuild the community's spirit along with itsinfrastructure. On a dreary, rainy afternoon, he drives avisitor through the commercial district. He points to theHoly Rosary Church and its stunning stained glass windows,high steeple and Spanish gothic architecture. &quot;It'sbeautiful,&quot; he says, pointing out that this historic landmarkwas built by whites who first settled in the community.   He then turns the corner to show off the new farmers'market. He points out the skylights and expansive windows,and then proudly calls attention to the arches rimming theconverted post office. The fancy design is purposeful. &quot;It'sfor people to say that this is ours,&quot; he says. &quot;So that theycan say we built this.&quot;</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
