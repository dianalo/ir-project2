 Thus, the need for user interface management systems(UIMSs) is greater than ever.andP;  A UIMS is a tool for creating and testing userinterfaces quickly and interactively instead of programming complex toolkitcomponents.andP;  The technology is nothing new; UIMSs have been around for sometime.andP;  But, because of the recent trend toward graphical interface, they'vegained a great deal of refinement.andP;  TeleUse latTeleSoft provides an exampleTeleUse of the advances being currently made in UIMS technology.andM;TELEUSE.andP;  Like most UIMSs, TeleUse has a screen layout editor, which TeleSofthas dubbed VIP, to create and modify user interfaces.andP;  The system includesthe Motif and Athena widget sets.andP;  It lets you select from menus ofwidgets--buttons, scrollbars, menu bars, pull-down menus, etc.--and palettesof attributes--color, font, geometry, patterns, etc.andP;  In addition, TeleSofthas widget templates, a useful features for viewing and implementingplug-and-play interface components.andP;  You can combine a collection of widgettemplates to form self-contained, reusable, logically related interfacecomponents.andP;  They also feature inheritance, so, when you change a widgetattribute, it can be replicated throughout the entire template.andM;Another useful features is the widget whiwser, which gives you a broaderperspective of the interface-in-progress.andP;  TeleSoft interfaces arehierarchical in nature, and the browser lets you view and manipulate thehierarchical tree structure of a screen layout.andP;  From the widget browser, youcan create, move, copy, delete, customize, and name specific widgets.andP;  Andyou can jump into the browser window while the interface remains active.andO;Therefore, changes made using eh browser are immediately reflected in thescreen layout in the work area.andP;  Very nicely implemented.andP;  Verysophisticated.andM;Once the layout is complete, the screen description is stored as an ASCIIfile that can be modified or reused without recompiling.andM;A Language for Dialogue Management.andP;  However, there's more to designing aninterface than merely laying out the screen.andP;  The other critical component ofa UIMS is dialogue control--i.e., dealing with the way users interact withthe interface and the way the interface and the application communicate.andO;Most UIMSs rely on C to implement interface functionality.andP;  TeleSoft hasimplemented a special dialogue language, called the D language, forspecifying and controlling the interaction between the user and the computer.andO;TeleSoft claims that D looks very much like C.andP;  However, it is usedspecifically to create events (commonly known as callbacks) that describespecific dynamic behavior.andP;  Events in TeleUse can eithre be external, wherethe function is the result of a user interaction (e.g., a mouse click cause adialog box to appear), or internal, where the function is sent from within aD module (e.g., updating a widget with a specific string).andP;  D D ialso rulesbased: A single event can have several rules depending on its circumstances(or conditions).andM;TeleUse also includes a set of tools to work with the D language:andM;* A graphical debugger, which allows you to set breakpoints, view variablecontents, and step through actionsandM;* A D interpreter, which is especially advantageous for testing andprototyping, making it possible to execute D modules without recompilingafter each modificationandM;* A D compiler, which translates D code into C codeandM;Integrating Interface and Application.andP;  Once the interface is designed andthe dialogue is written, TeleUse provides tools for integrating them with theapplication code.andP;  The first is the run-time library, a collection offunctions needed to convert description files into an executable program.andP;  Itcontains functions to control events, routines to integrate screendescription files, bindings between TeleUse and X Window intrinsics, andfunctions for modifying the interface at run-time.andM;The user interface (UI) builder then uses the features of the run-timelibrary to bind the interface to application code.andP;  The UI builder handlesall the details involved in the integration process (e.g., information aboutpaths, filename, and libraries).andP;  It also uses the D compiler for translatingthe interface code into C code.andM;Availability.andP;  TeleUse is available for $9,900.andP;  TeleSoft is marketing theproduct heavily to vendors and has already made a distribution agreement withDigital Equipment.andP;  TeleUse will run on DECstations, Data General A ViiON,and Sun (3 and 4) workstations.andM;CONCLUSION.andP;  TeleSoft has made some worthy gains in UIMS technology.andP;  Itsdialogue language is perhaps the most significant, but it has other featureswe haven't seen in other UIMSs, such as the widget templates, the interactiveattribute palettes, and the widget browser.andM;However, we're still looking forward to the time when the dialog component ofinterface design becomes more user oriented.andP;  We're not complaining aboutTeleUse specifically here, but about UIMSs in general.andP;  Today, UIMSs areprogrammers' tools, and that's too bad.andP;  Interface designers are justthat--designers, not programmers (or at least they should be).andP;  They knowabout the cosmetics, the composition, and the psychological implications ofuser interface design.andP;  UIMSs should be geared for them.andP;  End users areanother force to be dealt with.andP;  Eventually, users should be able tocustomize an existing application for the way they want to interact with it.andO;And users will be able to design their own applications, or overlap them, orreuse functions they like from other programs and libraries.andM;One hole in TeleUse is its lack of support for OpenLook.andP;  The industry hasn'tcome to an X toolkit conclusion yet,so TeleSoft's selection of Motif may besomewhat shortsighted.andP;  TeleSoft representatives say that they have beenlooking into the idea of support for both toolkits (and we are finallybeginning to see interface technology that supports both).andP;  However, theymaintain that the technical differences between Motif and OpenLook are enoughto get in the way of merging both toolkits smoothly.andP;  Furthermore, OpenLookhas a few different versions to contend with.andP;  Nonetheless, until a truestandard emerges, tolkit independence may be the best--albeitdifficult--solution.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
