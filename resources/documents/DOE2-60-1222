Shifting cavity walls and scanning the atomic beamone can vary the Lamb shift. The value of the Lamb shift in a cavitymay exceed a typical magnitude of the fine structure energy. For a roughresonance tuning the Coulumb multiplet occurs to be strongly mixed anda novel classification is necessary. (author). 8 refs, 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
