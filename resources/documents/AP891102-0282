Having already pumped $106 million into his Cray-3, CrayResearch said Wednesday its $98.6 million contribution to spinofffirm Cray Computer Corp. hinges on Seymour Cray's continuedaffiliation with the new supercomputer company.   Gary Smaby, an analyst who follows Cray Research for theMinneapolis-based Smaby Group, said, ``The most revealingdisclosure is that the deal is off if Seymour leaves the firm ordies.''   Cray, 64, is to be chairman and a computer developer for CrayComputer, a 241-employee firm based in Colorado Springs. Thespinoff is to occur Nov. 15 through a distribution of stock toexisting stockholders of Minneapolis-based Cray Research.   Like Cray Research, Cray Computer will develop high-speedscientific computers known as supercomputers. Its machines willsell for $15 million to $30 million each.   The disclosure of Seymour Cray's financial importance to CrayComputer was one of several key points Cray Research revealedWednesday in an information statement on the new company.   In addition to hinging on Seymour Cray's presence, the $98.6million financial gift from Cray Research depends on no individualacquiring more than 20 percent ownership in the new firm, CrayComputer continuing to pursue the Cray-3 project and the avoidanceof bankruptcy by the new firm.   The split places the hopes for the 1990s of Minneapolis-basedCray Research squarely on the C-90 supercomputer design under wayin Chippewa Falls, Wis.</TEXT></DOC>
