Agency Suspends Aid To Refugee Camp After Suspicious Fire</HEAD><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A U.N. agency has suspended aid to arefugee camp run by the Khmer Rouge after a fire at a medical clinicprompted security concerns, an aid official said Tuesday.   Security personnel informed the U.N. Border Relief Operation thatthe clinic at the O'Trao camp, controlled by the Cambodianguerrillas, was damaged by a Dec. 24 fire, the official said.   After the blaze, the U.N. agency and private volunteer groupsunder its protection stopped supplies and visits to the camp, saidthe aid official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The clinic was run by Thailand's Catholic Office For EmergencyRelief and Refugees.   ``The Thai authorities asked us not to go there for securityreasons,'' the official said.   O'Trao, in northeastern Sisaket province near the Cambodianborder, houses about 17,000 refugees. It is one of four U.N.-aidedrefugee camps controlled by the communist Khmer Rouge, who have beencharged with widespread human rights violations against refugees.   The Khmer Rouge is the largest of three guerrilla groups fightingthe Vietnamese-backed Cambodian government.   The official said the cause of the blaze at the clinic was notknown. He said it might have been set by radical Khmer Rougeguerrillas unhappy that increasing numbers of refugees have hadaccess to the Western-influenced clinic.   The official said that a few days before the fire, a Cambodianmedic had been shot and seriously wounded at the O'Trao clinic.   The Khmer Rouge recently have moved at least 5,000 refugees outof O'Trao. Aid officials said the guerrillas apparently planned touse the refugees to populate areas of Cambodia from which Vietnamesetroops have withdrawn.   The Vietnamese and Cambodian government forces have staged borderattacks to stop the resettlement, diplomatic sources said.   On Jan. 1, a shell crashed into a house at the U.N.-assisted Site8 refugee camp, killing a woman and her child and seriously injuringher husband, officials said. Another woman suffered head cuts.   Site 8, the largest camp run by the Khmer rouge, houses about35,000 refugees from the Cambodian civil war and is near the border.</TEXT></DOC>
