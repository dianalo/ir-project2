There is one sure way to correct this situation and bringback the fish that once occupied Stellwagen Bank. Do whatLouisiana did: Put in drilling platforms.</LP><TEXT>   Since the late 1940s, more than 3,500 production platformsfor oil and gas have been installed in the offshore waters ofLouisiana. Statistics indicate that both commercial andrecreational fishing have improved more than 500% for almostall species. The platforms have created artificial reefs thatrise from the sea floor into the open air. A new food chainhas been provided for fish at all depths.   Soon after the first group of platforms was installed,sailfish, blue marlin and pompano were found in Louisianawaters for the first time and are plentiful today.   Each platform costs millions of dollars. In some states,ships are sunk and old car bodies have been dumped to providereefs. These are too few to be really effective and are notcontrollable. The oil platforms offer much less pollutionthan the dumped cars or even the fishing boats.   In view of the tremendous benefits from these platforms,many &quot;save-the-rig&quot; advocates have been trying to stop themfrom being removed after the oil and gas are depleted, as isnow mandated by the 1958 Geneva Treaty.   Somehow the people of New England seem to have beenbrainwashed against this solution to their fishing problem.   Dudley J. Hughes   Jackson, Miss.</TEXT></DOC>
