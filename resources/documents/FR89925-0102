Comments on the proposed noisecompatibility program should also be submitted to the above office.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This notice announces that the FAAfinds that the noise exposure maps submitted for the Sarasota-BradentonAirport are in compliance with applicable requirements of part 150, effectiveSeptember 11, 1989. These maps supersede those maps previously approvedon November 14, 1986. Further, FAA is reviewing a proposed noise compatibilityprogram for that airport which will be approved or disapproved on or beforeMarch 10, 1990. This notice also announces the availability of this programfor public review and comment.Under section 103 of title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise AbatementAct of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''), an airport operatormay submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulationsand which depict noncompatible land uses as of the date of submission ofsuch maps, a description of projected aircraft operations, and the waysin which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such mapsto be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties inthe local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport.An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are foundby FAA to be in compliance with the requirements of Federal Aviation Regulations(FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to title I of the Act, may submita noise compatibility program for FAA approval which sets forth the measuresthe operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing noncompatibleuses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatibleuses.The Sarasota-Manatee Airport Authority submitted to the FAA on September7, 1989, noise exposure maps, descriptions and other documentation whichwere produced during an airport noise compatibility planning study fromJune 18, 1983 to September 6, 1989. It was requested that the FAA reviewthis material as the noise exposure maps, as described in section 103(a)(1)of the Act, and that the noise mitigation measures, to be implemented jointlyby the airport and surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibilityprogram under section 104(b) of the Act.The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and relateddescriptions submitted by the Sarasota-Manatee Airport Authority. The specificmaps under consideration are Exhibit 5A, 1988 Existing Conditions NoiseExposure Map (page 73) and Exhibit 5B, 1993 Future Conditions Noise ExposureMap (page 74) in the submission. The FAA has determined that these mapsfor the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements.This determination is effective on September 11, 1989. FAA's determinationon an airport operator's noise exposure maps is limited to a finding thatthe maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained inappendix A of FAR part 150. Such determination does not constitute approvalof the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment to approvea noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that program.If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific propertiesto noise exposure contours depicted on a noise exposure map submitted undersection 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involvedin any way in determining the relative locations of specific propertieswith regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting the noiseexposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which propertiesshould be covered by the provisions of section 107 of the Act. These functionsare inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilitiesof local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in anyway under part 150 or through FAA's review of noise exposure maps. Therefore,the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contoursonto the map depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively withthe airport operator which submitted those maps, or with those public agenciesand planning agencies with which consultation is required under section103 of the Act. The FAA has relied on the certification by the aiport operator,under andSection;150.21 of FAR part 150, that the statutorily required consultationhas been accomplished.The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for the Sarasota-BradentonAirport, also effective on September 11, 1989. Preliminary review of thesubmitted material indicates that it conforms to the requirements for thesubmittal of noise compatibility programs, but that further review willbe necessary prior to approval or disapproval of the program. The formalreview period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be completedon or before March 10, 1990.The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of14 CFR part 150, andSection;150.33. The primary considerations in the evaluationprocess are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviationsafety, create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or bereasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing existing noncompatibleland uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible landuses.Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program withspecific reference to these factors. All comments, other than those properlyaddressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAAto the extent practicable.
