But among industry groups that delivered surprisinglystrong third-quarter earnings there's a clue that stockinvestors may want to follow in their search for earningsstrength: it's called pricing power.</LP><TEXT>   Surprisingly, some companies such as chemical producers,which typically have to slash prices in an economic downturnbecause of sluggish demand, have been able to maintain stableprices lately. Their secret? Inventories are so low thatcustomers aren't in any position to argue about suppliers'prices. Just-in-time inventory procedures are keeping thegears of production in sync with sales at the cash register;that's helping keep prices high.   &quot;No inventories means greater pricing power for dozens ofcompanies,&quot; says Roseanne Cahn, senior economist at FirstBoston.   The inventory-control and pricing-power theme is relevantto chemical stocks, such as Dow Chemical, and paper industryshares, such as Union Camp and International Paper; inpipeline companies, such as Enron, and in big banks, such asChemical Banking and Bankers Trust New York.   Overall, only 34 of 80 Dow Jones industry groups exceededanalysts' earnings expectations for the third quarter while46 stock groups came in below expectations. Total earningsfrom continuing operations for the more than 700 companies inthe Dow Jones Equity Market Index were 6.5% below the thirdquarter of 1990, and 2.5% below analysts' expectations,according to Benjamin Zacks, senior vice president at ZacksInvestment Research.   &quot;This should be the trough,&quot; says Mr. Zacks. &quot;Earningshave been in a steady, two-year decline, but now they areestimated to be up 15% in the fourth quarter.&quot;   One reason for the prospective earnings strength is thatcompanies are still slashing inventories. This week'sthird-quarter gross national product data, for example,showed a $14.4 billion liquidation in nonfarm inventories.   One company on which Brandywine Asset Management Inc. ismaintaining a big pricing-power bet is Dow Chemical.Brandywine owns a $16 million, 300,000-share stake in thechemical giant. Yesterday, Dow's shares closed at 53 1/2, up1/2. Brandywine thinks the stock could sail to 75 in the next12 months.   The Brandywine bet is that pricing power is shiftingsharply in the economy, from consumer-oriented companies toproducers of raw materials. Put another way, Brandywine isbetting that price inflation as measured by the producerprice index will be steeper than the growth in consumerprices -- that International Paper will have more controlover its prices than Wal-Mart, which is selling the finishedproducts, such as notebooks to school kids.   Paul Ehrlichman, vice president at Brandywine, says:&quot;We've decided to get as far away as possible from theconsumer. We don't want to own the company that makes thecoat; we want to own the company that makes the fiber in thecoat.&quot;   In Dow Chemical, Brandywine sees the first signs ofsuccess in its strategy; the Delaware investment companypurchased the shares for an average price of $39 startinglast fall. &quot;What normally happens in a recession is that thepricing of basic commodities begins to fall apart,&quot; says Mr.Ehrlichman. But this time something different happened.&quot;Prices of linerboard, steel and ethylene began rising, butthis was all met with skepticism. Then buyers saw the highoperating rates of plants, and extremely low inventories, andprice rises began to stick.&quot;   Dow Chemical raised the price of ethylene 2% to 4% duringthe past quarter, according to Mr. Ehrlichman. InternationalPaper and James River, two more Brandywine holdings, raisedprices on some paper products as much as 5%. Bethlehem Steeland Armco increased steel prices by as much as 4%, and aretalking about further increases, Mr. Ehrlichman says.   &quot;Pricing power is showing up much earlier in this cycle,&quot;says Mr. Ehrlichman. &quot;It is the revenge of thebasic-materials suppliers,&quot; which were punished severely forsloppy controls on staffing and inventories in the 1982recession.   Enron, the natural-gas pipeline concern, attributes lastquarter's stronger-than-expected earnings of 48 cents a shareto its gas services and power divisions. But Carol Coale,analyst at Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs in Houston,thinks tightening supplies of liquid fuels, such as propane,could also make a strong contribution to the company'searnings in the fourth quarter. The company tells Ms. Coalethat although production is strong, propane stockpiles weredown to 17 million gallons at the end of September comparedwith 25 million last year. With Kuwait out of commission,world-wide liquid fuel stocks are also low, she says.   &quot;The trend in tight supplies should continue to driveliquid fuel prices higher, on top of a seasonal trend ofprice increases in the fourth quarter,&quot; Ms. Coale says. &quot;Iwould buy the stock.&quot;   Banks enjoyed pricing power last quarter. Benchmarklending rates, such as the prime rate, have been around fourpercentage points higher than banks' cost of funds. Also,banks haven't lowered the rates they charge on a variety ofconsumer services, such as the interest rates levied oncredit cards. &quot;Banks are obviously benefiting from enormousfunding margins,&quot; says Stefan Abrams, chief strategist atKidder, Peabody.   If the pricing-power story holds, investors could see astrong shift in the stock market away from consumer-orientedgrowth stocks to cyclical-company shares, Mr. Ehrlichmanpredicts. He thinks Kellogg's 3-point tumble to 102 1/4yesterday, following downgradings and earnings estimatereductions by analysts, is an early example.   &quot;Kellogg has held pre-tax margins at record levels for anumber of years,&quot; Mr. Ehrlichman says. But with consumersretrenching, the company is going to have to spend more todefend its turf, he says.   &quot;They are scrambling to keep their historical earningsgrowth rate up,&quot; he says. Brandywine is guided by a &quot;value&quot;investment approach and has endured the humiliation ofsoaring growth stocks -- as have many other value managers --in recent months. But times are changing, these investorsthink. A tumble in growth stocks such as Kellogg &quot;has been along time coming,&quot; Mr. Ehrlichman says.   ---   WARY OF MACY: A longtime bull on R.H. Macy's junk bondshas turned bearish.   J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Michael Cha is urgingclients to sell Macy bonds, arguing that the securities areoverpriced in light of what many people now expect to beanother disappointing Christmas.   &quot;We aren't projecting liquidity problems for Macy, orsuggesting that the company will file for Chapter 11protection&quot; under the bankruptcy laws, says Mr. Cha. &quot;Butbond prices have risen sharply since November; we don't thinkthose prices can be supported at a time when consumerconfidence has fallen so dramatically.&quot; He noted that he isstill &quot;positive&quot; on the company.   Macy bonds fell slightly yesterday, losing about $10 foreach $1,000 of face value. The 14.5% bonds of 1998 traded atabout 84 cents on the dollar, while the 14.5% bonds of 2001were at 76 cents and Macy zero-coupons were at 52 cents. Allthree issues were much lower last November. Macy is expectedto release lackluster annual earnings tomorrow.   -- Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg</TEXT></DOC>
