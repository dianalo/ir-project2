Hawkins, D-Calif., said he was preparing a new bill but wanted totalk with administration officials first to see if there was roomfor compromise.   Across the Capitol, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., wasted notime in beginning the second phase of the fight, introducing a billidentical to the one Bush vetoed Tuesday.   ``The president should understand that this is an issue on whichCongress has only begun to fight,'' said Kennedy, chairman of theSenate Labor Committee. ``The issue is fairness and America'sworking poor deserve a fair increase in the minimum wage.''   Kennedy, too, said he hoped to strike a compromise with the WhiteHouse and with Hawkins invited Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole toappear before a joint session of the labor committees next week.   But Kennedy served notice he wanted to advance a new bill quicklyand would do so whether or not Bush gives ground.   ``I would prefer to work out an acceptable compromise with theadministration,'' Kennedy said. ``But if that is not possible wewill try to enact a measure that has the support of a veto-proofmajority.''   Initial White House reaction indicated that Bush was not about tobudge.   ``The Congress should enact the president's minimum wage proposalat the earliest opportunity,'' said Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.   Mrs. Dole said that if Congress is unwilling to accept Bush'sminimum wage proposal it should drop the issue and instead focus onjob training, vocational education and other efforts to help theworking poor.   ``I hope that now we can move on to the issues that will reallymake a difference in people's lives,'' Mrs. Dole said.   Bush's offer is to increase the hourly minimum wage from $3.35 to$4.25 by January 1992, with employers being able to pay all newhires a subminimum wage for six months.   The legislation he vetoed Tuesday would have increased the floorwage to $4.55 by October 1991 and contained a restrictive clauseallowing employers to pay a subminimum to some new workers for nomore than two months.   The House, under new Speaker Thomas S. Foley, tried to overridethe veto just 24 hours after it was issued, but the effort fellshort by more than 30 votes. The vote was 247-178, with 20Republicans joining 227 Democrats in trying to override the veto.Twenty-eight Democrats joined 150 Republicans in thwarting theleadership from reaching the two-thirds margin it needed to override.   A coalition of House Republicans also entered the second round ofthe fight, introducing a new minimum-wage proposal of their own thatalso includes a modest expansion of the Earned Income Tax Creditavailable to families with young children.   The new GOP measure would be closely studied by Democrats lookingto draft a new bill that will attract enough support to overrideBush in the event of a second veto.   While he introduced a measure identical to the one vetoed,Kennedy said he considered it only a start and would consideramendments. In the House, Hawkins was considering a proposal callingfor an increase in the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour within twoyears.   That level matches Bush's final target for the minimum wage butwould bring it there a year earlier than Bush favors. But Hawkinssaid he was not prepared to meet Bush's demand for the six-monthsubminimum, a provision the president has said must be in anyminimum-wage legislation for him to sign it.   The new Republican proposal matches Bush's three-year formula forbringing the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour. But it takes the middleground in the fight over the subminimum, allowing it to be paid forfour months _ twice what Democrats say they will allow and twomonth's short of Bush's demand.</TEXT></DOC>
