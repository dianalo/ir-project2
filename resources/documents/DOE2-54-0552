With the help of some examples an overviewis given of the intended concepts and projects, restricted to power generationplants. Cogeneration, combined steam- and gas turbines, Siemens/KWU heatinggasification installations (combustion of domestic waste) and differentreactor types for nuclear energy are discussed. Finally the option forsolar energy, in particular solar cells technology, is paid attentionto. Conclusions are made with regard to the energy consumption in theworld, in particular the developing countries; the division of energysupplies; the necessity to use more electric power generated by conventionalplants and nuclear plants; the growing importance of nuclear energy forpower generation and the increasing usage of renewable energy sourcesas an addition to the conventional energy sources. 17 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
