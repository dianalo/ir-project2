PostScript filesare assumed to be fat and lumpy, but it ain't necessarily so.andP;  Native fileformats are usually sleek, but when printed, they generally grow by a factorof 10 to 15.andP;  Illustrator 3.0 files, however, are as compact as any XPress orPageMaker document for equivalent amounts of text, and they expand by a fixedamount, only 10 to 15 Kbytes, when printed.andM;For business users, the real fascination of editable PostScript lies in thepromise of applications that would, for example, enable a clerk to update acarefully designed brochure by entering a group of figures without having tolearn a page-layout program.andM;A moderately skilled HyperCard programmer could write a stack to perform thisoperation on the all-text Illustrator file.andP;  And to top it off, Illustrator,which ignores Apple's LaserPrep file, will print two to 10 times faster thanXPress or PageMaker because Illustrator's native code is more concise thanthat created by the generic PostScript printer driver.andM;One might speculate, by extension, that since Adobe is rewriting Apple'sLaserWriter driver from scratch, Adobe may restructure it to createIllustrator-format print files as a matter of course! That would mean aMicrosoft Word, MacDraw or XPress document saved as a PostScript text filecould then be edited with Illustrator.andP;  If I haven't thought of it first --and I have no reason to believe I did -- you can bet someone already isworking on it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
