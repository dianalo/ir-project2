Chairman William Seidman said.    Mr. Seidman told the Conference Board, an industry-supported, nonprofit economic research concern, that profits of all commercial banks fell in 1987 to $3.7 billion, for a return of 0.13% on assets. By comparison, banks' profits in the previous year were $17.9 billion, for a 0.64% return on assets.    Giving a &quot;sneak preview&quot; of 1987 bank results that the FDIC is to announce this week, Mr. Seidman said 36% of the banks in the Southwest ran net losses in 1987. Only 8.5% of banks in the East had net losses, compared with 24% of banks west of the Mississippi River.    Mr. Seidman blamed the profitability decline on heavy Third World debt reserves, competition and economic problems in the Southwest.    He said 1988 looks &quot;a lot better,&quot; partly because banks aren't expected to repeat last year's set-aside of $18 billion in reserves for troubled international debts. He said 15 economic indicators point toward a stronger economy this year, while only four suggest weakness.    But the future &quot;doesn't look great,&quot; he cautioned. Competition from other financial services businesses is cutting bank profits. &quot;And there is nothing too encouraging in the Southwest,&quot; he said, where nonperforming loans continued rising in 1987 to nearly 6% of bank assets. &quot;Even a sudden turnaround in these economies could do little to help some beleaguered banks,&quot; he warned. </TEXT></DOC>
