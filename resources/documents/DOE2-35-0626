<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-35-0626 </DOCNO><TEXT>The interaction of the solar-wind flow with Venus is discussed as wellas the morphology of magnetic-field-line draping in the Venus magnetotail.Emphasis is placed on the importance of the interplanetary magnetic fieldX-component in controlling the configuration of field draping in thisinduced magnetotail. The average magnetic configuration of this magnetotailis studied. A connection is made between the derived consistent plasmaflow speed and density and the observational energy/charge range andsensitivity of the Pioneer Venus Orbiter plasma analyzer. 7 references.</TEXT></DOC>
