The sixth and largest batch of Vietnamese to voluntarily returnhome included nine babies who were born in Hong Kong. The totalnumber to return home since the first flight in March is 637.   The voluntary repatriation program, which is sponsored by theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has only attracted asmall fraction of the nearly 57,000 Vietnamese languishing in HongKong, where they are seeking asylum after fleeing their homeland byboat.   About 44,000 of the Vietnamese arrived after June 1988, whenHong Kong adopted a policy that treats all arriving boat people asillegal immigrants subject to repatriation unless they can provethey fled political or religious persecution.   Boat people denied refugee status may soon be sent back toVietnam forcibly.
