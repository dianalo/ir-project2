Prosper Avril came to power ina soldiers' coup.   ``This visit reflects our deep interest in Haitian affairs,''Bernard Aronson, under-secretary of state for Latin American andCaribbean affairs, said before leaving.   During his 24-hour visit, Aronson met with Avril, who came topower on Sept. 17, 1988.   ``We had the opportunity to talk directly, to view the progressmade, and to talk about future steps,'' said Aronson. He did notelaborate.   However, U.S. officials have recently praised Avril, saying hehas improved Haiti's human rights record and its efforts to combatdrug trafficking.   Soldiers angered by what they viewed as state-sponsored violenceousted former ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy a year ago and sent himinto exile in the Dominican Republic, which shares the Caribbeanisland of Hispaniola with Haiti.   The soldiers demanded respect for human rights and a return todemocratic rule.   Avril was expected to make a speech on state television Sunday tocommemorate his first year in power.   The general has promised to turn over power to an electedgovernment and allowed the creation of an Electoral Council.
