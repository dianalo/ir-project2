Comptroller Robert L. Clarke, in a speech at a meeting of theAssociation of Reserve City Bankers in Washington, said the studywas begun last spring to examine how banks handle buyouts and otherhighly leveraged transactions.   In a preview of the study's results, Clarke said bank examinersfound that most of the banks had special units to analyze andpackage the loans but did not have separate policies for approval ofhighly leveraged transactions.   He said most of the banks surveyed reported ``generallysatisfactory portfolio performance, that is to say, most of theportfolio is performing as anticipated.''   The banks also reported ``reasonable levels of classified andproblem loans and minimal losses,'' he said.   Full results of the study are to be released in February, he said.   In a leveraged buyout, an investment group borrows heavily to buyout stockholders and take over the target company. Sometimes thebuyouts are proposed by managers in an effort to thwart hostiletakeovers.   The company's new owners often either cut costs or sell offpieces of the company to pay back loans. Critics of the practicefear that the high debt levels could endanger both the bought-outcompany and the financiers of the transactions.   Last month, Clarke, whose office regulates about 4,400 of thenation's 14,000 commercial banks, ordered his examiners to monitorbank involvement in leveraged buyouts more closely. He told theexaminers to make sure banks had policies ensuring that they are nottoo heavily involved in LBOs, do not lend too much to singleborrowers and do not lend too much to a single industry.</TEXT></DOC>
