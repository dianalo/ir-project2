Fikes, 74, is a solitary sentry against a raging waterway _ theTrinity River. The river was forced from its banks by recordflooding in north and east Texas that killed 12 people in the stateand caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.   Authorities in southeast Texas expect the river to crest therenext week.   Fikes, a resident of the community of Sportsman's Paradise onthe upper end of Lake Livingston, about 80 miles north of Houston,uses a boat to get around the flooded homes and trailers abandonedthere. Most of his neighbors have left, he said late Thursday.   ``Some of us is trying to hang around and more or less try towatch after the place,'' he said. Guarding against the ever-presentthreat of looters, some using boats, is his big worry, he said.   ``If the water gets up real far, we can cut the electricityoff,'' he said. Until then, he said, he watches television andanswers an occasional telephone call.   His car is underwater, so when it's time to check out one of the25 scattered homes in the development, he goes by boat.   ``I have been going out fishing some, too,'' he said. ``But thefish are not fighting too good. The water is too swift. I won't getinto that fast-moving water.''   In another flood-stricken community near the lake, Vivian andE.L. Butler are also prepared to flee their mobile home if theyfeel endangered. The waters have reached her yard, but still arenot near her home, said Mrs. Butler.   ``I'm naturally nervous and watching it real close and don'tintend to stay if it gets bad,'' she said.   ``Right now I love it here and I wouldn't move unless it forcesme out,'' said Mrs. Butler, who retired to Sportsman's Paradisewith her husband.   The Butlers are among a small group sticking it out on thehighest ground in the subdivision. The lakeside property hasflooded before, but this time, the waters are expected to keep thearea isolated for weeks.   John Jadrosich of the Trinity River Authority said the regionfrom Lake Livingston south to Liberty, midway between Houston andBeaumont, could be flooded throughout the summer and into the fall.   Mrs. Butler said the couple has a boat standing ready with lifejackets, food and clothing in case they need to flee.   ``I've put all my valuable papers and whatnot up in the bank.I've got pictures and my Bible in a metal box to take in the boatwith me _ things that I don't want to lose,'' she said. ``We'vemoved everything up off the floor in case the water gets up high.We're just going to play it by ear.''   Trinity County Judge Jimmie Thornton said he and other officialsalso will patrol the area by boat to prevent looting.   The lake is expected to reach about 7 feet above its normallevel, Thornton said. ``This flooding limit was designed for thehundred year flood, and it looks like that's what we're getting,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
