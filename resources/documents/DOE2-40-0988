The high-velocity components are compactand well collimated in the east-to-west direction. The lower-velocitycomponents are extended and, though not well collimated, can be dividedinto blue shift-dominated and redshift-dominated sectors. The displacementof the low-velocity CO is the same for other bipolar structures relatedto the outflow activity. These data support the outflow hypothesis forthe northeast-to-southwest structure rather than the disk hypothesis.The low-velocity CO feature represents the cavity wall of the outflow.61 references.</TEXT></DOC>
