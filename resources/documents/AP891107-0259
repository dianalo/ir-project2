Mack and Monaco, writing in the November issue of AgriculturalOutlook magazine, said general economic growth ``looks likely to bemildly supportive of U.S. agriculture'' over the next six to 12months.   In their review, the two economists said assessments of thegeneral economic situation have changed considerably over the lastyear, ``shifting progressively'' across three main possibilities:an inflation spiral similar to that of the late 1970s, an easedmonetary policy induced by recession, and recently a ``deceleratingexport growth'' due to the rise in value of the U.S. dollar abroad.   ``Adroit policymaking and midyear commodity price slides haveeliminated the first two possibilities as probable outcomes overthe coming six months,'' the report said. ``The current expansionis virtually assured to last well past its seventh birthday (thismonth).''   But economic forecasting is not without pitfalls androllercoaster thrills. Consider what has happened in the lastcouple of years.   In early 1988, many economists speculated about rising inflationand another upward price spiral that could spell trouble in themonths and even years ahead.   By mid-1988, the report said, the chairman of the FederalReserve Board warned it might be necessary to cool off the economy.Interest rates began to rise.   Consumer prices, which rose 1.8 percent in 1986 and 3.6 percentin 1987, rose 4.1 percent in 1988. And in the first quarter of 1989overall consumer prices grew at an annual rate of 5.4 percent,while producer prices jumped 10.2 percent.   ``But food and energy price hikes accounted for most ofinflation's quickend pace,'' the report said. ``Producer prices forfinished food products rose 5.2 percent in 1988, but spurted anannualized 13.1 percent in the first quarter of this year, perhapsbecause of (last year's) drought.''   Producer prices of finished energy goods such as gasoline andheating oil jumped at an annual rate of 41 percent in the firstthree months of 1989, mainly because of tighter OPEC productionrestrictions and global oil mishaps.   ``Rising interest rates began to take a toll on interestsensitive components of demand, housing and autos in particular,''the report said. ``The economy slowed sufficiently that by themiddle of the second quarter of this year, fears of an impendingrecession replaced worries over spiraling inflation,'' the reportsaid.   With inflation easing, the Fed eased back on monetary policy toward off recession, and interest rates came down. A third-quarterCensus Bureau survey of anticipated spending for plants andequipment suggested continued robust growth.   ``As inflation and recession fears dissipated during the firstthree quarters of 1989, concern began to mount about the risingvalue of the dollar,'' the report said. ``By September, the dollarwas up 12 percent from the first of the year.''   A rising dollar tends to reduce U.S. export volume and increaseimports by raising the prices of goods sold to foreign countriesand reducing prices of items imported by the United States.   ``While the dollar has gone up throughout 1989, it is stillabout 37 percent below its historic peak in 1985,'' the reportsaid. ``Some analysts associated the recent rise with climbing U.S.interest rates and relatively slow money growth. With U.S. interestrates flat or slightly falling, some now expect the dollar's valueto diminish.''   Forecasts by the International Monetary Fund indicate that whileU.S. dollar movments are likely to be modest over the next fewmonths, growth in major developed countries ``suggest continuedhealthy demand'' for U.S. exports, the report said.   The IMF forecast put Japan's real economic growth at 4.7 percentin 1990, West Germany's at 3 percent and Canada's at 2 percent. Thethree account for about 40 percent of U.S. exports. Economies ofdeveloping countries, which also accounted for 40 percent ofoverall U.S. exports in 1988, are expected to show continued robustgrowth.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Nov. 12</NOTE></DOC>
