Richard L. Dailey, 49, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor chargesof failing to file returns in 1985 and 1986, was sentenced Monday.   U.S. District Judge John T. Copenhaver Jr. also ordered Daileyto perform 150 days of public service and to pay $95,000 in taxesplus penalties on $295,000 he earned during 1985 and 1986. If hefails to make the payments within three years, his probation willbe extended by two years, Copenhaver said.   The judge told Dailey he didn't impose a fine because Dailey's``tax obligation is staggering in comparison to your lack ofassets.''   Dailey said he experienced marital problems and businesssetbacks in coal mining equipment leasing ventures.   ``I made substantial mistakes and caused humiliation andembarrassment to my son and my father,'' said Dailey, who was statetax commissioner during 1972-77 under Gov.
