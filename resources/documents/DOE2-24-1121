Computerized operations management(COM) seeks to reduce costs through the integrated automation of severaltraditional utility operations with related functions. The former includeservice termination, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)functions, peak shaving, and meter reading. Related functions includeinteracting with smart appliances, home security systems, and readingwater and electric meters. The technology required for COM systems exists,but the economic and institutional issues are unclear. Despite theseuncertainties, domestic and foreign manufacturers seem to be moving towardgreater integration of their utility automation systems. Utilities wishingto encourage the development of the COM approach can incorporate theseconcepts into their automation plans; include compatibility requirementsinto system specifications; make manufacturers aware of these plans;and urge trade associations and research institutes to develop compatibleequipment.</TEXT></DOC>
