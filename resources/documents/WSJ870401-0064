HilderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/01/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> HFD GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><TEXT>   Home Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association of San Diego, the nation's eighth-largest thrift, said it applied to withdraw from coverage by the ailing Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp.    If approved, the move into the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. would save Home Federal about $10 million a year in deposit insurance premiums. However, Home Federal said it might not switch, depending on the outcome of various legislative and regulatory issues.    Recently, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board has tried to impose an exit fee for thrifts leaving the FSLIC. The Bank Board lost the first round in a legal challenge to that policy, and its appeal is still pending.    Meanwhile, the Bank Board is trying to have authority for such a fee written into a bill to raise new funds for the FSLIC. The Senate passed a version of the bill last week without an exit-fee provision, but a version being considered by the House contains the fee language. The maximum exit fee would be equal to two years of current FSLIC premiums, or about 0.4% of a thrift's deposits.    Home Federal is the largest thrift to attempt to switch into the FDIC. And while executives of other thrifts frequently complain that they must pay higher premiums than FDIC-insured institutions, few of the major thrifts have enough tangible capital to qualify for FDIC insurance.    Currently, the FDIC charges premiums of one-twelfth of 1% a year to insure deposits; the FSLIC charges that amount plus a special assessment of one-eighth of 1% a year.    Home Federal said it applied to become a California-chartered commercial bank at the same time it applied for FDIC insurance. The state charter would allow Home Federal, now federally chartered, to continue its real estate development activities, said Robert F. Adelizzi, president, in an interview.    Mr. Adelizzi said Home Federal might have to change the corporate structure of its development activities, but said that wouldn't affect the development unit's business plan.    Home Federal's real estate operations provided pre-tax income of $36 million last year, or about 22% of Home Federal's pre-tax income of $161.5 million. Net income was $103.4 million, or $4.87 a share.    If Home Federal makes both switches, it would be obligated to make early repayment of about $1.6 billion of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. In doing so, Home Federal would incur penalties whose exact amount would depend on interest rates at the time of the repayment, Mr. Adelizzi said.    Thrift industry sources suggested that Home Federal was trying to increase its chances of avoiding a FSLIC exit fee by filing before Congress approved one. Mr. Adelizzi declined to discuss reasons for the timing of Home Federal's applications, but said the moves put Home Federal &quot;in the best position to remain flexible for the future.&quot;    Mr. Adelizzi said Home Federal's net worth, or assets minus liabilities, is about 7% of its assets of $12 billion, calculated under generally accepted accounting principles. He said Home Federal would meet the FDIC requirements for state-chartered banks of a 5.5% ratio between primary capital and assets. Primary capital includes shareholders' equity and loan loss reserves, but excludes most goodwill, which is the the price paid for an acquisition above the book value of the assets acquired.    Analysts applauded the move, but expressed some doubt about whether Home Federal ultimately will make the switch to FDIC.    &quot;It's a very intelligent choice,&quot; said Jerome I. Baron of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. In addition to paying lower deposit insurance premiums, he noted that banks usually have to pay slightly less for deposits than thrifts. And in 1991, when California allows banks from all other states to enter, Home Federal would be &quot;a big retail bank, sitting there, FDIC-insured, ready to be picked off,&quot; he said.    Mr. Baron said he believes Congress is likely to enact a bill containing an FSLIC exit fee because most of the nation's 3,200 thrifts won't lobby against the fee, since they don't have enough capital to switch to the FDIC.    Of Home Federal's FDIC application, Mr. Baron said, &quot;My best guess is, it'll do wonders for (Home Federal's) stock in the near term and that it will not go through.&quot;    Home Federal common stock closed at $33 a share yesterday, up 37.5 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    One other major California thrift company, Great Western Financial Corp., previously has indicated it is considering applying to switch to FDIC insurance. Already this year, Great Western changed the name of its thrift unit, the nation's third-largest, to Great Western Bank from Great Western Savings. The unit retained FSLIC insurance and a federal savings bank charter. The Beverly Hills-based concern didn't have any additional comments yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
