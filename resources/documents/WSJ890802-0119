The Canadian unit closed in Toronto at 85.12 U.S. cents, up from 84.69 cents Monday.    &quot;Today's spurt in the dollar reflects the attractiveness of Canadian interest rates,&quot; said Aron Gampel, Bank of Nova Scotia senior economist. U.S. short-term rates have been declining while Canadian rates have remained firm.    The spreads between Canadian and U.S. short-term rates have nearly reached record levels, said Barry Davenport, senior vice president of Treasury markets with Bank of Montreal. &quot;It's pushing the {Canadian} dollar up and so long as rates stay up, so will the {Canadian} dollar.&quot;    In trading yesterday, yields on three-month Canada Treasury bills widened to 4.19 percentage points above comparable U.S. rates from 4.05 points Monday.    The Bank of Canada is trying to keep Canadian interest rates high to combat inflationary pressures in the Canadian economy.    The central bank showed no signs of responding to demands from politicians and others for a relaxation of its monetary policy. Financial analysts predicted that the central bank's influential bank rate would be little changed tomorrow from its current level of 12.36%. The rate is what the Bank of Canada charges on its loans to commercial banks.    The central bank intervened in the money markets Monday to prevent Canadian short-term rates from following the decline in U.S. rates.    Some analysts predicted the spread between short-term Canadian and U.S. rates will widen further. Mr. Gampel, the Bank of Nova Scotia economist, said it will probably widen to more than 4.5 percentage points by month's end. Mr. Davenport said widening spreads could push the Canadian dollar up to 86 U.S. cents in coming weeks.    The analysts said Canadian short-term interest rates are expected to remain at current levels until the fall. Michael Gregory, an economist with Royal Bank of Canada, said rates should begin declining in September and the dollar should follow. He predicted the dollar will fall back to 82 U.S. cents by year end.    Mr. Gampel predicted Canadian short-term rates will decline two or three percentage points by year end, causing the dollar to fall to 80 U.S. cents.    Analysts said that on a purchasing power basis the Canadian dollar is currently substantially overvalued relative to its U.S. counterpart. But for the high interest rates, they estimated the Canadian dollar would be trading at about 80 U.S. cents.    Canada's consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 5.4% in June, mainly because of increases in sales and excise taxes contained in recent federal and provincial budgets. </TEXT></DOC>
