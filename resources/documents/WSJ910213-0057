Yields on many certificates of deposit are down 2 1/2percentage points or more from the highs in the spring of1989. Meanwhile, the average rate charged on unsecuredpersonal loans has risen nearly 1/2 of a percentage point. Oncredit-card debt, the average rate is up about 3/4 of apercentage point.</LP><TEXT>   Consumers are now paying almost three times as much ontheir credit-card debt as they are getting on one-year CDs,and banking specialists say the situation isn't likely tochange soon.   &quot;As interest rates fall, the nation is led to believewe're going to enjoy all kinds of declines in lending rates,&quot;says Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, a NorthPalm Beach, Fla., newsletter. &quot;That has never been the case.&quot;   The spread, or difference, between what banks pay forfunds from depositors and other sources and what they chargefor loans translates into profit margins. Many banks,battered by souring real estate and other loans, are beingpressed by regulators to boost earnings in order to beef upcapital.   &quot;Industry earnings are down, and that puts the pressure onto keep margins up,&quot; says Gary Zimmerman, an economist withthe Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Banks also areabsorbing the cost of increased premiums for federal depositinsurance.   Banks generally adjust interest rates on deposits andloans in response to changes in their cost of funds and thedemand for credit. Yields on money market securities, such asTreasury bills, and competition with other financialinstitutions are also factors.   But rates on deposits tend to fall further and faster thanrates on many loans. &quot;It's a balancing act,&quot; says Robert J.Hutchinson, senior vice president for retail marketing atManufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York. &quot;Even though thecost of funds is going down, the costs of doing business areup.&quot;   Among other things, he notes, banks have to take intoaccount rising bankruptcies, delinquencies and bad debts. AtSan Diego Trust andamp; Savings Bank, for instance, 50% to 60% ofcredit-card losses can't be recovered because the debtorshave filed for bankruptcy-law protection, says PhillipWilson, senior vice president.   Some lending rates have fallen. The average rate on a30-year fixed-rate mortgage, according to Bank Rate Monitor'ssurvey of 100 large banks and thrifts, currently stands at9.28%. The rate was about 11% in April 1989. Adjustable-ratemortgages have fallen, too. The prime lending rate, abenchmark for many commercial loans as well as for homeequity loans and other variable-rate consumer loans, rangesfrom 9% to 9.5% at major banks, compared with 11.5% in thespring of 1989.   But rates have hardly budged on auto loans, unsecuredpersonal loans and bank credit cards. Bank Rate Monitor'saverage rate on new car loans, for instance, is 12.16%, thesame as a year ago and down only slightly from 12.53% inApril 1989, when interest rates were at their recent highs.   Unsecured personal loans are at an average of 17.41%, upfrom 17.22% last year and 16.97% in April 1989. The averagerate on bank credit-card debt is 18.86%, up from 18.51% ayear ago and 18.08% in the spring of 1989.   Meanwhile, the yields that consumers are getting on theirmoney have been tumbling. The average yield on a one-year CDlast week was 6.84%, according to Bank Rate Monitor. That ismore than 2 1/2 percentage points lower than the 9.49%average in April 1989, and more than one percentage pointbelow the 7.94% average a year ago.   Six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction yielded6.11%, compared with 9.25% on April 24, 1989.   &quot;Rates that are set in the market every day, like CDrates, come down faster,&quot; says Robert Duggar, chief economistfor the American Bankers Association. &quot;Rates set by anadministrative decision process, like credit-card rates, areintended to be able to carry through various stages of thebusiness cycle.&quot;   Spreads are particularly wide in some parts of the U.S. InLos Angeles, for instance, First Interstate Bank is charging21.5% on unsecured personal loans and a one-year CD yieldsjust 5.86%. New York's Citibank charges 19.8% on credit cardswhile its one-year CD yields 6.10%.   Consumer-loan rates may come down a bit if interest ratescontinue to fall as predicted, bankers say. But a decline inlending rates will likely be slow and small, they add. &quot;Thereare an awful lot of expenses,&quot; says San Diego Trust's Mr.Wilson, who's also vice chairman of the American BankersAssociation's consumer credit division. &quot;You have to havesome expectations of profitability to stay in business,&quot; hesays.</TEXT></DOC>
