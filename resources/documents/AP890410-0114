In North's third day as a witness, a contentious one, prosecutorJohn Keker tried to show that North dipped into the fund, arrangedfor $200,000 in free life insurance, allowed his colleagues to makehuge profits on Iran-Contra dealings, and accepted a free securityfence.   At the start of cross examination at his trial, North said hekept track in a spiral-bound notebook of every penny he disbursedfrom the Iran-Contra fund which totaled between $240,000 and$300,000.   ``The ledger is still around?'' asked prosecutor John Keker.   ``It was destroyed,'' North said.   ``Do you know who destroyed it?''   ``Yes,'' he said. ``I did.''   Later, Keker asked whether North was nervous about destroyingthe ledger. North said not, because ``I couldn't believe I couldever be accused of doing anything dishonest with that money.''   In quick succession, Keker touched on other charges and Northfired back answers.   _ On the $13,800 security system installed at his home, paid forby co-defendant Richard Secord: ``To this day, I don't know exactlywho or how that security system was paid for. ... I did intend topay for it.''   _ On a $200,000 insurance fund set up for North's family byIran-Contra moneyman Albert Hakim: Asked if he knew Hakim ischarged with bribing him, North said, ``He is not guilty of it,because Mr. Hakim did not try to bribe me.''   _ On profits by Secord and Hakim: Keker asked if he knew whetherSecord made ``a few hundred thousands or millions'' and North saidhe didn't know. But, he added, ``I believed then and I believetoday General Secord was taking fair and just compensation for themany hours he was putting in.''   Keker asked North if, ``in fact everybody was taking a piece''of the money involved?   ``No, that is not so,'' said North. ``You are talking to one whodidn't.''   North said he was angry at the government, ``having been fairlywell trashed,'' at the time he wrote two back-dated letters inDecember 1986 to make it appear he was going to pay for thesecurity system. ``It has to be one of the dumbest things I havedone in my life,'' he said.   He wrote the letters after he was fired from his NationalSecurity Council job and threatened with becoming the target of acriminal investigation.   Meanwhile, the government asked the judge in North's trial todeny his request for surveillance records on foreigners involved innegotiations to free U.S. hostages.   The Justice Department said North's attempt near the end of thetrial to subpoena the records was calculated to ``graymail theUnited States'' by threatening disclosure of secrets to forcedismissal of the charges.   Earlier Monday, North testified that former President Reagan andhis attorney general, Edwin Meese III, concealed U.S. involvementin a November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles from Israel to Iran.   In a meeting on Nov. 12, 1986, Reagan clearly ``had made adecision not to disclose'' the shipment, North said.   The president told a news conference on Nov. 19 _ a week afterthat meeting _ that the government had not been involved with othernations in shipping weapons to Iran and that the United States hadshipped none before he signed a January 1986 authorizing document.Immediately afterward, the White House put out a statement in whichReagan said a third country had been involved.   North testified that he assumed Reagan had known of thediversion of Iran arms sale funds to the Contras, a contentionReagan has denied.   North said he shredded the financial accounting notebook, pageby page, on orders of the late CIA Director William Casey, becauseit had names and addresses of people whose lives would be in dangerwere they to become public. The shredding took place, he said, inlate 1986 when the Iran-Contra affair began to unravel.   Keker intimated that the $8,038 paid for North's car, aChevrolet Suburban with 51,000 miles, came from theNorth-administered fund established to pay the expenses ofNicaraguan rebel leaders when they were in this country and tosupport the Iran initiative.   There had been previous testimony that rebel leader AdolfoCalero put $90,000 to $100,000 in traveler's checks into the fundand retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Secord put in $150,000 to $200,000cash.   ``Do you remember being tempted to use the traveler's checks foryour personal use?''   ``Never once,'' North shot back.   North is accused of converting $4,300 of those checks to his ownuse, although not in connection with the used car.   He said that in 1985 he earned about $50,000 from the MarineCorps, where he was a lieutenant colonel, and also had some incomefrom investments and dividends.   ``We had a yard sale or two, and I think my wife sold somepuppies,'' he said. ``We always lived on our budget, we always werevery frugal.''   Asked where the money came from to buy the car, North said itcame out of the family fund which he started in 1967 with aninsurance settlement from an automobile accident. He said when hecame home at night, he would throw his change into that box.   ``The change out of your pocket grew to $15,000 in your house?''Keker asked. North said yes.   In November 1986, two days after he said he had told Meesedetails of the Hawk missile shipment, he heard Meese say at a newsconference that the Israelis had made the 1985 shipment withoutU.S. involvement.   Meese gave ``a whole series of answers'' that were``inconsistent with what I had told him,''said North. ``It made mewonder whether I had talked to the attorney general.''   One of the 12 felony charges against North is that he lied toMeese during their meeting.   He is also charged with lying to Congress, destroying orfalsifying government documents and accepting an illegal gratuity.</TEXT></DOC>
