Thousands of terrified people, many out for Christmas shopping,ran for cover as hundreds of riot police and protesters battled inthe main shopping district. Authorities deployed 9,000 riot policeto block the march by about 2,000 radical students and dissidents.   Police had no figures on arrests or injuries, but officers andprotesters were seen with blood pouring from head wounds and otherinjuries. Protesters and officers caught by the other side werebrutally beaten.   Protesters demanded the fall of Roh and the arrest of formerPresident Chun Doo-hwan for human rights abuses and corruption underhis authoritarian rule. Dissident leaders announced at a rally atMyongdong Cathedral the formation of a new radical alliance to tryand topple Roh.   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan! Overthrow Roh Tae-woo!'' protesterschanted.   Riot police in green combat fatigues and visored helmets blockedmarchers with shields as they tried to march from the cathedral tothe presidential palace. Students with iron clubs attacked police,but were driven off with tear gas grenades.   Hundreds of protesters then regrouped several blocks away in ashopping district. Students attacked riot police with firebombs andpaving stones they ripped out of the sidewalks. A small group ofpolice was surrounded and beaten to the ground by screamingprotesters.   Charging riot police swept protesters away several times, butstudents repeatedly surged out of sidestreets to resume fighting.Hundreds of people were trapped in vehicles as the fighting swirledaround them and police hurled tear gas grenades into subway stations.   The protest in freezing temperatures was smaller than three majorviolent protests in Seoul last month to demand Chun's arrest.   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in1980, went into rural exile last month after apologizing to thenation. Several of Chun's relatives and associates have beenconvicted or charged with corruption.   Roh, another former general, asked the nation to forgive Chun andinstalled a new Cabinet Nov. 28 as part of efforts to defuse thefuror. Roh is trying to distance his own administration from hisformer ally.   A small group of Buddhist monks and students clashed Saturdaywith riot police at the Buddhist temple on the east coast where Chunis staying in seclusion. Six people were injured in the clash.   Dissident leaders announced at the rally the formation of a newalliance to seek Chun's arrest and the overthrow of Roh. Speakerssaid Chun could not be brought to justice without toppling the Rohgovernment.   ``We declare that it will be possible to clarify the whole truthof the past misdeeds and punish those responsible only when Chun andRoh are brought to testify before investigators,'' said adeclaration by the alliance.   The radicals and dissidents do not have wide public support, butmany South Koreans are angry over the handling of the Chun issue andwant action of some kind.   Opposition leaders Saturday accused Roh of delaying actionagainst Chun and repeated demands that the former presidentcooperate with the National Assembly probe of misdeeds under hisgovernment. Chun stepped down in February.</TEXT></DOC>
