Chipello (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> HTWN OBAT UNNB </CO><IN> BNK </IN><TEXT>   With mergers sweeping the U.S. banking industry and national banking on the way, independent community banks might seem doomed to go the way of the local grain mill.    Daniel Dart is betting otherwise. The 31-year-old Mr. Dart last year gave up a promising career at prosperous State Street Boston Corp. He recruited a mid-career Bank of Boston Corp. lending officer, rounded up some investors and started Blackstone Bank andamp; Trust Co. in Boston's gentrifying South End.    An unbankerly risk? Perhaps. But Mr. Dart saw a &quot;window of opportunity&quot; and didn't want to miss it. Boston is flourishing, office space in the South End is still cheaper than in nearby business districts, and deregulation of deposit rates allows banks to compete in new ways.    Mr. Dart has plenty of company. Though the number of banks in the country has declined in recent years -- in 1986 it was around 14,200, down from just under 15,000 in 1982 -- bank start-ups have surged in some states. Between 1984 and 1987, 63 new banks were formed in Georgia, up from 13 between 1975 and 1983. Start-ups in Connecticut rose to 30 in the past four years from only a couple in the previous four; Massachusetts had a similar increase.    Consolidation is leaving behind new banking niches, and in parts of the country where the economy has been strong, entrepreneurial financiers are trying to fill them. Some focus on restoring first-name, backslapping relationships that got lost when the local bank was bought up. Others lure depositors with attractive rates, made possible by lean operations. Still others cater mainly to wealthy individuals.    Nationwide statistics for independent start-up banks are hard to sort out. In states where branch banking is restricted, bank holding companies often expand by setting up new banks, skewing the national numbers. But in a few individual states, start-ups have increased sharply even as larger, established banks seek to build economies of scale through mergers.    The recent pattern indicates that small banks -- at least the well-run ones -- will continue to have a place in America's patchwork of deposit-taking institutions. While expanding regional banks offer deep pockets and a broad product line, their size limits their flexibility in dealing with small customers. And while some start-up investors hope to sell out eventually to bigger banks, many of the new banks intend to stay small and independent.    &quot;Someone who can serve the needs of Delta Air Lines or Coca-Cola is not going to be able to serve the needs of the John Does -- at least not in the same way&quot; a local bank can, says Robert Moler, deputy banking commissioner in Georgia.    James Schmidt, portfolio manager for the Tucker Anthony Freedom Regional Bank Fund predicts that consolidation among large and midsized regional banks will leave more assets in the hands of the nation's 100 or so biggest banking companies, but that thousands of independents will continue to thrive.    Short-term success, of course, is no guarantee of staying power. New banks can count on their incorporators, who typically are well-connected local figures, to steer a fair amount of business the bank's way. Keeping customers and building on the early base is tougher.    In California, five of the 60 banks that opened in 1983 failed, and several others have floundered, according to Pam Findlay, president of the Findlay Report, which tracks California financial institutions. A glut of new banks, a shortage of capable senior managers, and problems in the real-estate market combined to force a shakeout, says Ms. Findlay.    As the hard-hit Southwest has shown in recent years, moreover, banks' health generally is tied to that of the economy at large: Nationwide recession would mean a shrinking market and more problem loans. But where the economy has been strong, well-run small banks have managed to grab market share.    Boston-based Olympic International Bank andamp; Trust Co., the first in a spurt of Massachusetts start-ups that began in 1985, quickly became profitable by aggressively courting a range of small-business clients. In sports-crazy Boston, having a couple of former Boston Celtics basketball stars and an ex-Boston Bruin hockey player on the board of directors hasn't hurt, either.    Bank of Western Massachusetts, a Springfield-based start-up, last year persuaded Mark Larder, owner of three ski shops in the area, to shift his borrowing from Bank of New England. The start-up's top executives had dealt with Mr. Larder as lending officers at Bank of New England. To get his business, they agreed to supply a line of credit during the current ski season -- something Bank of New England wouldn't do, Mr. Larder says.    At the larger bank, he says, &quot;Whenever we wanted a loan, everything had to go to a committee, and we never knew who was on the committee.&quot; Mr. Larder says he was concerned about the new bank's ability to stand by him through a poor ski season, but he accepted assurances from Timothy Crimmins, the bank's president, who had helped Mr. Larder while at Bank of New England.    To appeal to depositors, many start-ups shun glassed-in teller counters and roped-off waiting lines for a more genteel aura. Walk into Olympic International's brick waterfront office, for example, and instead of queuing, you take a seat at an account officer's desk. A pneumatic tube whisks cash out from a back-office clerk.    University National Bank in Palo Alto, Calif., has tellers, but it serves coffee in real china and offers after-hours service by appointment. Robert Tennyson, a travel-agency operator, took his business to University National about a year ago, after Crocker National Bank was acquired by Wells Fargo andamp; Co. Following the merger of the big banks, service at the local branch was &quot;a nightmare,&quot; according to Mr. Tennyson: Teller lines of 15 to 30 minutes &quot;were not uncommon&quot;; the bank &quot;lost one of our checks for six weeks,&quot; and it &quot;treated us like we were nonexistent.&quot; A Wells Fargo spokeswoman concedes that there were problems following the merger, but says branch service has since improved.    At University National, says Mr. Tennyson, &quot;you never wait more than 30 seconds for a teller, and, when the tellers are busy, management personnel come and take deposits.&quot; What's more, he says, &quot;Everyone smiles.&quot; Customers also get a complimentary shoeshine.    Other new banks have borrowed a leaf from money-market mutual funds' book. Instead of hiring tellers and account officers to take deposits in the office, they advertise deposit rates in regional newspapers. Customers call on toll-free telephone lines and conduct transactions by mail, by wire or through an automated-teller network shared with other banks.    Boston's Blackstone Bank -- unrelated to New York-based Blackstone Group -- and New England Federal Savings Bank in nearby Wellesley use those tools to hold down bricks-and-mortar overhead. In addition, neither bank has a secretary; all employees, including the presidents, produce their own correspondence on personal computers. Such cost-saving measures enable them to offer attractive deposit rates. Blackstone's frequently rank among the highest in the nation, according to 100 Highest Yields, a weekly survey of federally insured deposit rates, and New England Federal's have also made the list.    Blackstone, which opened shop in late August, now has around $20 million in assets and expects to reach the break-even point by April, says Mr. Dart. Blackstone shares some characteristics of the more community-oriented start-ups: Ann Hartman, the former Bank of Boston lending officer who joined Mr. Dart in setting up the bank, has lived in the South End for several years and heads a neighborhood association. To fund its local lending, though, Blackstone seeks deposits from throughout New England.    Walter Collins, a Fitzwilliam, N.H., retiree, recently plunked around $20,000 in Blackstone Bank, sight unseen. Mr. Collins, who responded to a newspaper advertisement, says Blackstone's address sounded to him like it might be in a high-crime neighborhood. But &quot;the rate was high and it was insured, so why not?&quot;    Customers aren't the only people who sometimes choose to leave big banks for small ones. Some managers leap at the chance to run a new institution.    Gerald Mueller, president of New England Federal, decided to help set up his bank after the savings bank he had worked for was taken over by a Hartford, Conn.-based thrift. Life after a merger tends to be less pleasant when you're the &quot;mergee,&quot; or weaker party, says Mr. Mueller.    James Banks, president of Connecticut's Bank of Darien, helped start the bank in 1985 after another small bank he headed was picked up by a larger institution. With its emphasis on sit-down, personal banking, Bank of Darien garnered about 10% of posh New York suburb's deposits in its first year, according to Mr. Banks. Hometown Bancorporation Inc., Bank of Darien's holding company, plans to use part of the $11 million it raised in its 1986 public offering to seed bank start-ups in other tony Connecticut towns.    Despite the stress that small-bank executives put on filling local needs, some of their investors undoubtedly hope to score big profits in a few years by selling out to larger banks. But it's unlikely many start-ups will grow big enough to make attractive targets -- and many small-bank executives insist that's fine with them.    For one thing, being small also means being able to be iconoclastic. In an industry where humor tends to be frowned on, University National has gotten mileage out of offbeat promotional tactics. Painted on one of its vans is a mural of bank employees making money -- literally. Early ads tweaked big banks with such themes as &quot;Don't cry for me, Argentina.&quot;    And, instead of toaster giveaways, once a year the bank's lobby is piled high with 10-pound sacks of sweet onions from Mr. Schmitt's wife's hometown of Walla Walla, Wash. -- one sack per customer.    ---             How Two Start-Up Banks Have Grown                 (In thousands of dollars)      Olympic International Bank andamp; Trust Co.
