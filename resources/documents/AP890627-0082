Other students hurled rocks and firebombs at riot police on twocampuses Monday. Official Yonhap news agency said 15 students werearrested.   The chairman of the radical National Council of StudentRepresentatives told a news conference he expects 15,000 students tocongregate at Seoul's Hanyang University for a march Friday, the eveof the festival.   ``We've not given up hope to go to North Korea,'' said ImChong-suk.   The World Youth Festival will be held in North Korea's capital,Pyongyang, July 1-8.   Prosecutors confirmed they issued warrants Monday for the arrestof Im and two other leaders of the radical student group, chargingthem with violating the National Security Law by talking on thetelephone with North Korean students. The law forbids communicationwith people in an ``anti-state'' body. Im was undeterred. He saidSouth Korean students plan to draft a joint communique with NorthKorean students and, if they cannot get to Pyongyang, details willbe arranged through third countries using telephones and facsimilemachines.   Students holding valid passports and those studying overseas arebeing encouraged to try to get to Pyongyang through third countries,he said. The Seoul government says any who attend without notifyingthe government or a South Korean Embassy can be prosecuted.   Seoul accuses Pyongyang of using the festival to stir updissident movements in South Korea _ a charge the Noth Koreangovernment denies. The festival is a political and sports eventattended mostly by youths from the Third World and communist bloc.   At Hanyang University Monday, fighting erupted when 200 studentsscreaming anti-government slogans and hurling rocks and firebombsattacked riot police blocking campus gates.   About 500 visored police ringed the campus and stopped outsidersfrom entering. Student leaders said some students from the provincesalready were inside.   In provincial Taegu city, police fired tear gas to disperse 500students from three schools who attacked them with firebombs androcks outside Yongnam University, according to Yonhap.   The South Korean agency said 15 students were arrested.   South and North Korea have been bitter rivals since their landwas divided at the end of World War II. North Korea invaded thesouth in 1950 and the three-year Korean War left more than l milliondead on both sides. A truce was never signed and enmity deepened.</TEXT></DOC>
