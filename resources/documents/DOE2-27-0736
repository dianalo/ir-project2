<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-27-0736 </DOCNO><TEXT>The characterization data has been obtained for Arab Berri extra lightcrude oil (API{sup 0} 46.9), which is one of the four crude oils beingcommercially produced by Saudi Arabia. Further, six true boiling pointfractions (IBP-95{sup 0}C, 95-205{sup 0}C, 205-260{sup 0}C, 260-345{sup0}C, 345-455{sup 0}C and 455{sup 0}C+) of this crude were characterizedin terms of API gravity, total sulfur, H/sub 2/S, merceptans, molecularweight, elemental analysis for total carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, analysisof various metals and paraffin, aromatic and naphthalene contents oflighter fractions. The kinematic viscosity-temperature data have beenobtained for 95{sup 0}C+ TBP fractions for wide range of temperatures.</TEXT></DOC>
