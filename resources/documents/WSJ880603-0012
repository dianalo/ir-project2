The dollar was mixed against other major currencies in trading that dealers described as very active, volatile and at times confusing.    In hectic early European trading, the pound plunged more than three pfennig to 3.1130 marks from above 3.1450 marks. Then around noon, the Bank of England raised one of its key money-market intervention rates, signaling that it intended to defend the currency. About an hour later, major British banks, led by Barclays Bank PLC, began raising their so-called base-lending rates -- which serve as a benchmark for commercial lending -- by one-half a percentage point to 8%.    Sterling climbed briefly, but then fell as traders used the higher rates to resume selling the currency. At one point, it fell as low as 3.1030 marks and $1.7952. Eventually, the currency stabilized, but only after the Bank of England intervened by buying pounds and selling dollars.    Nonetheless, many traders predicted further rate increases would be needed to support the pound, perhaps as early as today. The interest-rate boost reversed three successive rate cuts totaling 1 1/2 percentage points that began in mid-March.    &quot;Sterling is very vulnerable at the moment,&quot; said Keith R. Baker, foreign-exchange manager in London for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. He said there was very heavy selling from speculators in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore.    Kevin Gardiner, an economist at London stockbroker Warburg Securities, said: &quot;The crack in the pound appeared earlier and quicker than anyone expected. This isn't the end of the story.&quot; For a while, he said, the pound was in &quot;a free fall.&quot;    In late afternoon New York trading, the pound stood at 3.1041 marks and $1.8047, down from $1.8136 late Wednesday and $1.8559 before the Memorial Day weekend. At the beginning of this week, the pound stood as high as 3.19 marks. Three weeks ago, it traded as high as $1.8915.    Several weeks ago, &quot;sterling looked like a good bet; the expectation was we'd get through the 3.20-mark level,&quot; said Martin Kingsick, a vice president at Royal Bank of Canada in London. &quot;We didn't.&quot;    The pound's value against the mark -- and other European currencies that are effectively or actually pegged to it -- is more important to Britain than the pound/dollar rate. That's because about 60% of the U.K.'s exports go to Europe as opposed to 10% to the U.S.    Traders said the pound came under strong selling pressure from speculators who were unwinding large long-sterling/short-mark positions by selling pounds and buying marks. Because the dollar is used as an intermediary in such cross-rate transactions, it rose against its British counterpart but fell against the mark.    In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.7201 marks from 1.7310 marks the day before. It rose to 126.13 yen from 125.43 yen on Wednesday. Most West German banks were closed for a holiday.    The dollar opened at 126.07 yen in early Friday trading in Tokyo.    Accelerating the pound's plunge, said traders, were so-called stop-loss orders triggered when the pound fell through key points on charts that some traders use to predict currency movements. Corporations, institutional investors and other financial institutions often leave orders with banks to buy or sell currencies automatically at specific levels.    &quot;There's a drastic unwinding of all speculative positions that flowed in during the (Prime Minister Margaret) Thatcher-(Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel) Lawson brouhaha,&quot; said Trevor N. Cass, foreign-exchange manager for Barclays Bank. &quot;All that hot money is flowing right back out again.&quot;    In early March, Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Lawson publicly disagreed over the country's yearlong unofficial policy of trying to hold the pound between 2.93 marks and 3.00 marks through intervention. As a consequence, sterling was allowed to rise.    Currently, Britain's currency is plagued by a growing trade and current-account deficits plus an enormous expansion of consumer credit. While London has projected about a #4 billion trade deficit for this year, market estimates run from #6 billion to #8 billion.    Traders said sterling was also damaged by recent increases in dollar interest rates. In fact, some traders said the West German and Japanese central banks took advantage of the dollar's recent relative strength to sell dollars to reduce their enormous foreign-exchange reserves.    Mr. Cass said the market's attitude toward the U.S. currency &quot;was wait and see; it used to be bearish.&quot;    Jack Kessler, a senior vice president and head of Chase Manhattan Bank's currency operations in New York, predicted, &quot;The dollar will remain firm, at least until we start approaching the release of the (April) trade numbers&quot; on June 12.    Even so, some analysts are worried that the deficit could climb back to as high as $12 billion. Kenneth de La Salle, foreign exchange manager for National Westminster Bank PLC in London, said: &quot;The dollar will ease back after a few days unless you get (a U.S.) interest-rate hike.&quot;    He also expects the pound &quot;to stabilize after the panic of the last few days.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for June delivery settled at $467.00 an ounce, up $9.40. Estimated volume was a heavy six million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $466.35 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Thursday, June 2, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
