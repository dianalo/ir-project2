Moldavia became the eighth republic to declareindependence from the Soviet Union and the third since thefailed coup against Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Gorbachev, appearingresolute and more confident of himself than he has since thecoup occurred, warned of economic disaster and civil war ifthe secessions take place. Now that reactionary forces were&quot;out of the way,&quot; he promised that a brand new treaty ofsovereign states that addresses the needs of the republicscould be drawn up.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Maybe this is the most tragic consequence of the coupthat in the past three days the centrifugal tendencies gainedtremendous momentum,&quot; Mr. Gorbachev said. &quot;We are facing aserious threat of the union falling apart. I'm telling youthat with great alarm, with great suffering.&quot;   Later in the speech he added, &quot;I'm still for thepreservation of the union. I won't settle for anything lessthan that. If there's something different, I will step down.. . . Nothing, nothing will be accomplished by breaking upthe union. Nothing will come of it, I assure you. There willbe trouble.&quot;   Mr. Gorbachev's views were supported by liberal democraticreformers who also voiced alarm at the speed with which thebreakup of the Soviet Union was proceeding.   &quot;The situation is more dangerous than theanti-constitutional coup we survived,&quot; said SergeiStankevich, an aide to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. &quot;Ifthis chaos continues, it will be a deathblow to our alreadyweakened economy.&quot;   Anatoly Sobchak, the liberal Leningrad mayor said, &quot;Ifeveryone breaks into small countries, only Russia will winfrom this and will dictate, not them. They should think aboutthat.&quot;   Criticism of the central role that Mr. Yeltsin and otherRussian republic officials are now playing in the Uniongovernment also erupted. Mr. Yeltsin's statement Monday thathe would have to carefully examine border agreements withsecessionist republics that had large Russian populationsinspired old fears of Russian nationalism and a rise of theRussian empire.   &quot;Should Russia take a wrong step, all reactionary forceswill immediately begin gathering in republics under thebanner of national communism,&quot; said Davlatnazar Khudonazarov,a deputy from Tadzhikistan.   But Mr. Gorbachev, forever indebted to Mr. Yeltsin forspearheading the resistance to the coup and literallybringing him back to Moscow from his vacation home in theCrimea where he had been held for three days, defended theRussians. Mr. Gorbachev said the Russians have no such plansto dominate the country. &quot;We talk every day to coordinate ourdecisions. I would very much like you not to overreact to theinformation you receive.&quot;   Mr. Gorbachev is hoping to restore some order quickly byasking all the republics to join an economic treaty thatwouldn't bind them to a more permanent union treaty. As afirst step he met with the heads of the Russian, Kazakh andKirghizistan republics to agree on priority measures to stemthe current crisis, according to the Tass news agency. Hetold the Parliament that he also plans to form a team toimprove the country's manageability and restore some accordamong the major political forces.   &quot;If we don't improve the country's manageability, the waveof public discontent will hit us,&quot; he said. He added, &quot;Allthe democrats should unite. I see my task in uniting them andI ask you to set this task for yourself.&quot;   Mr. Gorbachev said he is willing to let those republicsthat want to secede to do so in a constitutional fashion.&quot;Nobody can deny a nation the right to secession if thepeople themselves have decided to go through with it,&quot; hesaid.   Of the eight republics that have declared independence,the three Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estoniaappear to be well on their way. The European Community andits 12 member states agreed to recognize them as independentcountries, 52 years after they were forcibly incorporatedinto the Soviet Union.   In a unanimous decision by EC foreign ministers, theCommunity said it would support the Baltic states in theirquest to rejoin the family of world nations, includingmembership in the United Nations, the Council of Europe andthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Besidesthe 12 EC countries, the list of countries recognizing thethree tiny Baltics states is growing by the hour. Icelandrecognized them Monday, along with Denmark. Norway and Swedenannounced their decision to do so yesterday. Bulgaria, Canadaand Australia also moved toward establishing formal ties.   Moldavia, which is made up mostly of territory absorbed bythe Soviet Union in the 1940 pact with Hitler that alsoannexed the Baltic states, celebrated its declaration. Thedecision seems sure to pass, as ethnic Romanians form 64% ofthe population.   Mr. Gorbachev dismissed the recent Ukrainian declarationbecause a referendum last March showed that a majority of itspeople wished to remain in the union.   The union treaty that had been scheduled to be signed bynine republics Aug. 20 gave away many of the Kremlin's powersover the republics and had been criticized by hard-liners whodidn't like the breakup of central authority. It is widelyassumed that the union treaty orchestrated by Mr. Gorbachevis one of the factors that led to the coup attempt.   Mr. Gorbachev in his statements to Parliament yesterdayvehemently discounted conspiracy theories that he saidclaimed he might have planned the coup and played a role init. He also accused his old friend and former Parliamentspeaker Anatoly Lukyanov of betraying him during theattempted coup. Saying that a quickly called session of theSupreme Soviet the day the coup started could have &quot;nipped itin the bud,&quot; he called Mr. Lukyanov a &quot;coward&quot; who tried to&quot;save his hide.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
