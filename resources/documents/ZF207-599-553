 800 SW 37th Ave.,andO;#765 Coral Gables, FL 33134 (305) 445-0903 (800) 888-2562 List Price: $95andM;Requires: 256K RAM, DOS 2.1 or later.andM;In Short: FormTool won't let you design fancy forms, and its data entryfeatures are minimal (though it does import dBASE files).andP;  But if your needsare basic, its simple, clean design makes it quick to learn and use, and itcomes at a bargain price.andP;  Not copy protected.andM;Block Publishing Corp. has no pretensions about its FormTool.andP;  The companyadmits that the $95 program won't design fancy forms or perform sophisticateddata entry.andP;  Its raison d'etre is to produce basic forms quickly, with anemphasis on utility.andM;FormTool lives up to its mission forthrightly.andP;  You can use it to lay out aform in less time than it takes to draw a couple of boxes by hand.andP;  You doeverything by pressing function keys or two-key combinations or by makingselections on pop-up menus.andP;  The program is reasonably easy to learn, and youcan get help or a list of all the commands on the screen at any time.andM;FormTool's main work screen is bordered at the top and the left side bycolumn and row numbers.andP;  A status line at the very top of the screen tellsyou your exact row and column coordinates.andP;  Working with whole numbers thatrepresent a raw position in this way is conceptually easier than convertingdecimal numbers into fractions of inches or thinking in tenths and twelfthsof inches.andM;The row and column numbers never change, but you can change the way they aretranslated into horizontal and vertical measurements by changing the settingsfor characters per inch and lines per inch.andP;  This is important becauseFormTool is a character-based program that doesn't show the true fonts on thescreen.andM;MAKING IT FITandM;To get the relative size of text fonts and boxes to match, you may have tochange the settings.andP;  For example, a box near the top of our purchase orderhad a field title 25 characters long.andP;  If FormTool was left at the defaultsetting of 10 characters per inch, the title ran past the right side of thebox and overwrote part of the next box.andP;  But when the cpi setting was changedto 17, the box was resized accordingly and the form came out fine.andM;The example above reveals one of the headaches of using FormTool--you have toplay with your form-design and measurement settings to achieve a goodalignment.andP;  This is especially true when you start to use large fonts: theirplacement on the form is something of a mystery until you print it.andP;  In mostcases, you'll have to print a few test forms and make adjustments to get thefinal form into shape.andM;Once you're familiar with the drawing facilities, a little forethought willlet you lay out a form very quickly.andP;  We were able to draw our purchase-orderform, for example, in 6 minutes.andP;  Lines and boxes are very easy to draw anderase.andP;  Pressing F7 draws a horizontal line from the cursor to the nextvertical line or to the right edge of the form, while pressing F8 erases ahorizontal line at the cursor.andP;  You draw vertical lines using the F5 and F6keys.andM;Furthermore, you can draw boxes either as individual units or as grids ofsquares or rectangles.andP;  The ability to draw any size grid, with as manycomponents as you want, is quite a powerful feature.andP;  Just by responding tofour simple prompts, you can instantly draw an entire honeycomb of boxes.andP;  Oryou can create a series of lines simply by erasing the outermost side bordersof a one-column grid.andM;BASIC ABILITIESandM;The same ease that characterizes FormTool's drawing facilities carries overto its text-handling abilities.andP;  You can set the font characteristics forwhole blocks of text, lines, or individual characters with just a fewkeystrokes.andP;  Justification can function across lines or grids of boxes, too.andO;Unfortunately, these text attributes are assigned to positions on the form,so if you move the text afterwards, the attributes don't move with it.andM;Data entry in FormTool is very basic.andP;  You can justify the data in thefields, but that's about the only thing you can do--you can't verify numbers,protect fields, use conditional tagging, or calculate anything.andP;  You can'teven generate an automatic date or time from the system.andP;  FormTool can mergeinformation into your form in any order, from dBASE and .DIF files as well asfrom comma-delimited ASCII files.andP;  It can also export the data on a form, butonly when such data in comma-delimited ASCII format.andM;A couple of special features give FormTool the feel of a program of somepretension.andP;  You can open up to four active forms at the same time inwindows.andP;  You can size and position the windows, and you can cut and pasteblocks between them.andP;  In addition, a handy form &quot;organizer&quot; helps you keeptrack of your forms and can even search by several criteria, such as size anddate of last update.andM;With its quick and easy design techniques and its special features, FormToolis more than it seems at first.andP;  Yet it stays true to its mission as a basicprogram.andP;  You can't draw circles or arcs, use halftones, import graphics, orsee font styles on the screen, and the data entry facilities allow only thesimplest field definition.andP;  But, if the forms you create don't have torepresent your corporate image and your data needs are plain, then thisproduct may be just right.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
