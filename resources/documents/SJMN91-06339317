The first segment of the trail -- probably fromMission Boulevard, at the west end of the canyon, to &quot;The Spot,&quot; a venerableroadside tavern at mid-canyon -- may be open within two years.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  The Weekly  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NILES CANYON TRAIL PLANNED FOR HORSES, HIKERS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Also ran in EX2/7, EX3/2  </MEMO><TEXT>     Part of the work lies in discovering what went before. &quot;There are sometrails there now and there were some trails there before,&quot; said Jocelyn Combs,a director of the East Bay Regional Park District. &quot;And there had been bridgesthere that aren't there anymore.&quot;;   Getting the trail built is a study in theart of inter-governmental cooperation. The park district is doing most of thework, but most of the land is owned by the Alameda County Water District,which uses the creek as an aqueduct to transport water.;   Some of the land isowned by the San Francisco Water Department, which has not always supportedpublic access to its properties. But, said Steve Fiala, a park district staffmember, &quot;There seems to be a change in the atmosphere there.&quot;;   Fiala is oneof those who hiked the creek bed looking for trails. &quot;We had a pretty goodtrail for a certain distance, then it turned into rock climbing,&quot; he said.;  In some places, footbridges will have to be built so the trail can cross thewinding creek. But bridges can be a problem after a heavy rain, because theytrap debris coming downstream, impeding the rush of the water and causingfloods. The solution may be breakaway bridges that are hinged on one side toswing out of the way, according to Frank Borghi Jr., a director of the AlamedaCounty Water District.;   Borghi remembers &quot;the old days,&quot; when &quot;We used tohave a lot of people using the canyon.;   &quot;In the last few years, people havestopped using it, and it's a shame, because it's a beautiful place,&quot; he said.;  Over a period of many centuries, Alameda Creek has cut a meandering,steep-walled canyon through the Diablo Range. Its five-mile length is markedby picturesque views and sunlight filtered through the trees, which growthickly in some areas, in contrast to the grass that covers most of thefoothills in the area.;   Before the spread of the automobile made moredistant mountains easily accessible for nature lovers in San Francisco,Oakland and San Jose, the canyon was much sought out as a rustic picnic area.&quot;It was the place to go in the early years of our century,&quot; Borghi said.;  When the trail is complete, it will be connected to other hiking trails thatwill take those who are strong of leg to parks all over the Bay Area. Thecanyon trail will intersect the Ridge Trail, which is intended to follow thetops of the hills all the way around the bay.;   At the west end of thecanyon, the trail will connect to the Alameda Creek Trail, which follows thecreek all the way to the bay, and ties into the Ring-Around-the-Bay trail atwater's edge.;   From the east end of the canyon, near Sunol, the trail willeventually connect with other trails that go east to the Del Valle Reservoir,south of Livermore, and north to Mount Diablo and beyond to the SacramentoRiver Delta.;   &quot;Niles Canyon is a natural thing of beauty and should beenjoyed,&quot; said Jim Beard, the general manager of the water district. &quot;Therearen't too many canyons like that around.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAN STOBER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911204  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  628  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, December 4, 199100339317,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
