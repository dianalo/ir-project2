(DTI), is a supplier of host-based interfaces forreal-time data buses such as MIL-STD-1553, ARINC 429, and emerging high-speedbuses such as STANAG 3910.andP;  DTI also offers a line of communications supportequipment for the emerging Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI).andM;DTI occupies more than 16,000 square feet of office, laboratory, andmanufacturing space in Dayton, OH, as well as offices in Glendora, CAandgt;Denver, COandgt; Boca Raton, FLandgt; and London.andP;  The company was founded in 1981 andis wholly owned subsidiary of Dynatech Corporation of Boston, MA, a $433million corporation that includes more than 50 companies serving a variety oftechnology markets.andM;The company started in the early post-research days of the evolution ofMIL-STD-1553 and AFWAL DAIS programs.andP;  DTI became one of the originalproviders of host-based real-time systems development tools (bus emulatorsand monitors) addressing the needs of full-scale systems integration.andP;  DTI isnow developing high-speed commercial digital communication test products,with an emphasis on fiber-optic networks.andM;DTI currently has several products in its LANHawk line which it has developedfor the FDDI network market.andP;  DTI protocol support equipment for FDDI isintended to offer developers, systems integrators, and end-users a range oftesting, symbol generation, and monitoring applications.andP;  The LANHawk productbase is continually being expanded and enhanced by DTI.andM;Members of DTI's technical staff participate in several standards committeesand organizations--such as ANSI X3T9--to determine which emerging standardswill become the future forms of high-speed digital communications.andM;This Special Report will examine DTI's FDDI-based LANHawk product family.andM;LANHawk--Product OverviewandM;DTI's LANHawk products comprise a line of protocol support and test equipmentfor the FDDI standard.andP;  The equipment provides a real-time, &quot;global&quot; view ofFDDI ring traffic which allows users to test the conformance of theirproducts to the FDDI standard and monitor the performance of the FDDI ring.andM;DTI's LANHawk product line includes a network monitor and a protocol testpackage comprising a symbol generator and a logic analyzer interface.andM;LANHawk-5750 Network MonitorandM;The LANHawk-5750 Network Monitor is an FDDI LAN monitor which features aproprietary interface implementation and both an Intel 80386 processor and aMotorola 68030 processor in a desk-top package, with full-color, pull-downmenu screen presentations.andP;  The 5750 has up to four physical fiberconnections (taps).andP;  Each tap connects into the FDDI LAN via a splitter thatis said to separate approximately 10% of the FDDI ring's light withoutimpacting ring timing and performance.andM;The 5750 has three options to increase data collection efficiency: up-frontcapture logic, collection management, and data truncation.andM;Upfront capture logic defines up to eight unique data events for each tap andup to four levels of logic.andP;  The 5750's real-time data collection managementcaptures data before an event, after an event, or both.andP;  Data truncationabilities permit the 5750 to store a variety of data &quot;slices.&quot;andM;The LANHawk 5750 provides a filtering scheme to locate records of interest.andO;Captured data can be searched in a variety of formats.andP;  This searchingcapability is combined with an ability to differentiate frame types anddetect line state changes and discretes.andP;  Brief viewing of records presentsthem as one-line entireandgt; detailed viewing presents records as sequentiallists of the fieldandgt; and for &quot;hard-core&quot; troubleshooting, records can beviewed in a hexadecimal format.andP;  All three viewing options can be presentedon the 5750 screen at the same time.andP;  To enhance understanding, each datarecord includes type classifications and timers.andM;The real-time status and real-time trend statistics are designed to providethe user with an understanding of how the FDDI ring is performing.andO;Performance issues such s token rotation time, frequency of claim frames, andring utilization can be verified in real-time as they dynamically change.andM;The 5750 will soon be enhanced to include traffic generation capability.andO;This will allow the user to load the network with a specified level oftraffic and monitor network performance at that traffic level.andP;  Once anetwork is up and running, the traffic generation feature can be used in amaintenance mode to monitor the affects of adding new stations to the ring.andM;In addition, other new 5750 features will include TCP/IP decode andEthernet/Async remote access.andM;The 5750 is available as a protable unit for maintenance personnel, systemsintegrators, and production engineers who often require a small footprint andruggedized packaging.andM;DTI FDDI Protocol Test PackageandM;DTI's FDDI protocol test package includes the LANHawk-3726 Symbol Generatorand the LANHawk-5708 Logic Analyzer Interface.andP;  The 3726 defines andgenerates symbol-level test scenariosandgt; the 5708, coupled with a logicanalyzer, monitors the results.andM;LANHawk-3726 Symbol GeneratorandM;The 3726 appears as a repeater to the FDDI test ring.andP;  It has the capabilityto immediately turn off its light-emitting diode (LED) and verify how nodelogic performs to the off-state.andM;The 3726 provides the ability to inject streams of FDDI symbols (testscenarios) onto an active FDDI test ring, creating symbol pattern scenariosto help users understand conformance, interoperability, latency, wrapping,link errors, and connection issues.andP;  Test scenarios consist of valid frames,invalid frames, fragments, and valid/invalid line state symbols.andP;  Once testscenarios are defined and directed to be loaded into the 3726's 16K RAM, theycan be sent once or many times.andP;  The 3726 gives its user control over thefill symbols between messages on an FDDI ring.andM;LANHawk-5708 Logic Analyzer InterfaceandM;The second part of DTI's FDDI protocol test package is the 5708 LogicAnalyzer Interface.andP;  Using DTI's discrete interface implementation andinternal logic with the user's logic analyzer enables user' to monitor FDDItraffic at full bandwidth.andP;  Users' logic analyzer pods (Hewlett-Packard 165XXand 165X) can be connected to the 5708.andP;  Logic analyzer timings, internalmappings, and a series of triggering scenarios are included with the 5708setup software.andP;  Like the DTI LANHawk 5750, the 5708 is a passive device thatdoes not impact ring timing and performance.andM;The 5708 scans each symbol received.andP;  If the start delimiter pair isdetected, a &quot;start of message&quot; signal is issued to the logic analyzer.andP;  This,in turn, allows the user to trigger on specific bytes of fields, such asframe control, addresses, information, and frame statuses.andP;  In addition, the5708 validates each FDDI message received and signals the attached logicanalyzer of the results.andP;  The 5708 enables users to define triggers forspecific line states, or line state changes, or that a line state changeoccurred.andP;  It concurrently signals the logic analyzer of the present linestate and the last line state.andM;ConclusionandM;The LANHawk product line adds a range of diagnostic capabilities to the FDDILAN manager's tool kit.andP;  Similar products have been successful in theEthernet and token-ring arenas.andP;  The question that remains to be answered iswhether or not there is (or will be in the near future) a large-enoughinstalled base of FDDI systems to generate a market for this, and similar,products.andM;For additional information on DTI's LANHawk product line, contact Carol Bakerat Digital Technology, Inc., 2300 Edwin C.
