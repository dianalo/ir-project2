Now, one of them thinks theJapanese company may finally be vulnerable -- in front of anAmerican jury.   The protagonist is Atari Corp., whose lawsuit against thecreator of the Super Mario video-game hero went to trial thisweek in federal court here. The outcome may well haveimplications for the rest of the $4 billion home video-gamemarket and beyond.</LP><TEXT>   The issue is whether Nintendo employed licensing andmarketing practices that violate U.S. antitrust law. Atari,based in Sunnyvale, Calif., alleges that Nintendo illegallycarved out an 80% stake in the market and cost consumershundreds of millions of dollars in overpriced video games andgear. For its part, Atari says that between 1986 and 1990, itsuffered $160 million in damages, an amount that by law wouldbe tripled if it wins its antitrust case.   &quot;We think the evidence is absolutely overwhelming thatNintendo deliberately and willfully monopolized the homevideo-game market in the U.S.,&quot; William Jaeger, Atari'slawyer, said in his opening statement Tuesday. &quot;Competitionwas not simply hurt. It was obliterated.&quot;   Nintendo, meanwhile, says Atari &quot;tried to compete on thecheap&quot; and lost out because of its own miscalculations,according to John Kirby, a New York lawyer representingNintendo. During opening arguments, Mr. Kirby noted that apredecessor company, Atari Inc., turned down a chance tointroduce the Nintendo system in the U.S. in 1983. He alsonoted that Nintendo is itself being seriously challenged inthe market for the latest video-game technology by a machinefrom Sega Enterprises Inc.   The trial, which is expected to last 10 weeks, issignificant because it is the first time that a jury hasexamined recurrent allegations of anti-competitive conduct byNintendo. The U.S. district judge in the case, Fern Smith, isalso presiding over other cases that accuse Nintendo ofmonopolizing the market for game cartridges and accessories.Last year, without admitting any wrongdoing, Nintendo settledFederal Trade Commission charges involving pricing of itsgame consoles, but Judge Smith has ruled the accordinadmissible in the Atari case because of its potential forbiasing the jury.   &quot;There is a fair odor of sour grapes in the Atari claim,and yet there are indications that Nintendo wasnoncompetitive, predatory and monopolistic,&quot; says BobKleiber, an analyst at investment banker Piper Jaffray andamp;Hopwood in Minneapolis.   Judge Smith specifically admonished both sides to avoidthe issue during the trial, and during jury selection, shesought to uncover any prejudice, asking potential jurorswhether they would have a problem with a Japanese companyowning an American baseball team -- which top Nintendoofficials proposed to do just last month. In contrast to thethumbs down given the idea by organized baseball, none of theprospective jurors was opposed.   Nonetheless, &quot;there is no question that Nintendo uses veryhardball marketing strategies, and it will be interesting tosee how an American jury reacts to a Japanese company,&quot; saysBoris Feldman, an antitrust lawyer in Palo Alto, Calif.,specializing in high-tech issues. &quot;If I were representing aJapanese company, I would not want to go in front of anAmerican jury.&quot;   Atari's main objections involve the way Nintendo hasenlisted independent software producers to write the videogames that run on its Nintendo Entertainment System consoles.Until December 1990, Nintendo prohibited licensees frommaking their games compatible with competing systems, such asones that Atari was trying to develop and popularize, for aperiod of two years.   Antitrust lawyers note that such exclusive licensingarrangments aren't necessarily illegal and indeed are commonand desirable in certain industries. But Atari's complaint isthat they became illegal because of the market clout thatNintendo possessed.   Atari believes that the provision &quot;locked up the entirecapacity of each publisher to make hit games,&quot; according toMr. Jaeger, and &quot;the thing that did Atari in was theycouldn't get the hit games.&quot; Moreover, Atari says, deals thatNintento cut with major retailers like Toys &quot;R&quot; Us forvaluable shelf space further hurt competition.   Nintendo's Mr. Kirby defends the licensing deals as &quot;a wayof marketing . . . as normal as apple pie&quot; and a reasonableway to ensure quality.   Atari's problem, he says, was underestimating the extentto which the video-game market would bounce back from adisastrous plunge in the early 1980s, and deciding toconcentrate instead on making personal computers. Atari Corp.was created in 1984 when former Commodore Computer Corp. guruJack Tramiel purchased some of the assets of WarnerCommunications' old Atari Inc.   Atari Corp. delayed the introduction of a key machine fornearly two years, giving Nintendo a chance to establishtechnical superiority, according to Mr. Kirby. He saysinternal Atari memos show that the company skimped onmarketing and software development, and he cites one case ofa major eruption over a $20 overnight delivery bill.   Analysts say that the results of the case will be closelywatched by other dominant high-technology companies,including Intel Corp., the chip maker, and software giantMicrosoft Corp.   Among those expected to testify are Mr. Tramiel and MinoruArakawa, the president of Nintendo of America Inc.,Nintendo's U.S. unit, based in Redmond, Wash. HiroshiYamauchi, president of the Japanese parent, was deposed foreight days by Atari attorneys in Japan and his testimony wasset to be read into the court record starting yesterday,although the attorneys were involved in a last-minutetranslation dispute.   Meanwhile, computer paraphernalia, including aseven-foot-tall Nintendo demonstration console, was creatingsuch a hum in the courtroom when the proceedings beganTuesday that Judge Smith said she was worried that she mightnot be able to guarantee a clear transcript of theproceedings. &quot;There is a very loud interference,&quot; said thejudge.</TEXT></DOC>
