In addition, another half-point increase in British banks' base lending rates and a boost in short-term interest rates in Japan tended to weaken the dollar against the yen and the pound.    The dollar eased slightly in Asian trading to 1.8803 marks at the end of the Tokyo day but rose to pierce 1.8900 marks in Europe on bullish market sentiment. After the dollar traded above 1.8900 marks for several hours and failed to push significantly higher, profit-taking began to send it lower.    Traders said central banks of West Germany, Britain, and Belgium then began selling dollars into the soft market, helping the dollar to plummet by about two pfennigs. The dollar staged a partial recovery in late European and New York morning dealings, but was buffeted by two reported interventions by the U.S. Federal Reserve in New York.    Late in the New York day, the dollar was at 1.8736 marks, down from 1.8805 marks late Friday and sharply below its intraday high of 1.8930 marks. The dollar was quoted at 135.46 yen, slightly up from 135.45 yen Friday. The dollar was lower against most other currencies.    In midmorning trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 134.28 yen.    Banque Nationale de Belgique confirmed it had sold dollars at 1.8750 marks; other central banks would neither confirm nor deny they had intervened.    Traders said the combination of the technical setback and central banks' apparent show of determination left the market edgy yesterday, wondering if central banks' thresholds of tolerance for a higher dollar are being approached.    Traders said the European central banks' actions appeared calculated to drive the dollar lower, rather than smooth out an upward move, because they were made as the dollar was already easing.    Yesterday's interventions were &quot;different from the last few weeks, when central banks had been selling in the face of strong dollar demand,&quot; said Graham Broyd, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. &quot;It's very unclear whether what we've seen was just short-term profit-taking, or whether we've just seen the top of the dollar.&quot;    Britain's major banks raised their base rates to 10.5% from 10% after the Bank of England signaled the move by offering its borrowing facilities to discount houses at the new rate.    The boost marked the sixth such increase since the beginning of June, but U.K. market analysts aren't convinced the latest move is enough to thwart inflationary trends in the economy. In fact, many market participants were expecting to see a one-point rise to 11%, and predict another half-point to one-point rate boost will occur in the next few weeks.    Pressure for even higher base rates stems from a series of economic statistics that highlight the economy's potential to overheat. Most recently, Friday's inflation data showed the annual rate rising to 4.6% in June from 4.2% in May.    Other factors behind the move included the pound's weak tone relative to a buoyant dollar, and a general trend toward higher interest rates in Europe and the U.S. Several economists felt the treasury only opted for a half-point rate boost to avoid causing any panic in the markets, or prompting a fresh rally in the pound.    Mark Cliffe, senior economist at Nomura Research Institute, says 12% base rates &quot;are entirely foreseeable in the next few months. It's a one-way direction for rates until the economy shows signs of cooling off.&quot;    The Bank of Japan Monday allowed short-term money brokers to raise the onemonth bill-discount rate 1/16 percentage point to 4%, brokers in Tokyo said.    Foreign exchange traders interpreted the move as a form of &quot;monetary intervention&quot; meant to boost the yen against the dollar. In contrast to the European central banks' strategies of selling dollars, the Bank of Japan has refrained from direct intervention during the dollar's recent rally.    Japanese traders said they don't expect the Bank of Japan to intervene directly against the dollar unless the U.S. currency surges to 138 or 140 yen.    In addition, the Bundesbank may increase a spectrum of key interest rates, beginning perhaps as early as today, in order to slow the dollar's rapid ascent and bring above-target money supply back under control, economists and analysts said.    Analysts say a one-quarter percentage point increase in the Bundesbank's key money-market steering instrument, the securities repurchase agreement rate, has been discounted by domestic money markets. The rate currently stands at 3.75%.    Analysts also expect the Bundesbank to increase the Lombard lending rate to 5% from 4.5%, probably next week, to raise the ceiling on money market interest rates.    On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $437.80 an ounce, down $2.40. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $436.40 an ounce.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Monday, July 18, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
