But the accord also tightens export restrictions for 30 ormore countries that are yet to sign thenuclear-nonproliferation agreement and for others that aresuspected to be developing long-range missiles. &quot;Depending onthe destination and circumstances of a particular export,some applications may be denied,&quot; the White House said.</LP><TEXT>   Strict security measures will be required for the shipmentof these advanced computers to such countries, including24-hour surveillance of the installation, periodic inspectionof computer programs, and limiting the access to thesemachines of certain individuals.   For shipments to allies in Western Europe and the PacificRim, meanwhile, U.S. and Japanese authorities will requireexport safeguards only for supercomputers above a specificperformance level and allow less-powerful models to beshipped under routine licensing, U.S. officials said.   The two governments have agreed to draw the line at 195million theoretical operations per second, or Mtops, whichwill also serve as a common standard for defining asupercomputer for regulatory purposes. Computers at 195Mtops, which are used for such things as weather forecastingand designing high-technology equipment, are just above thecapacity of the fastest mainframe computers.   The new standard is about 25% higher than the provisionalone that the U.S. has been observing. The higher ceiling willfree many U.S. models, including Cray Research Inc.'s XMScomputer, from the precautions normally associated withsupercomputer exports. These safeguards, which will remain ineffect for more-powerful machines, typically include customerguarantees that the machines will be secure from theft orunauthorized use; in some cases government-to-governmentagreements are also required.   The U.S. and Japan have been observing certain commonstandards for regulating such exports in recent years. And asa next step they will seek the cooperation of Europeancountries, which are &quot;emerging supercomputer suppliers,&quot; theWhite House said. Some companies in Britain, France andGermany have entered the supercomputer markets with newmodels that match the power of the conventional Crays bystringing numerous processors in parallel.   The bilateral agreement also provides for an annual reviewand &quot;indexing&quot; of the control standards to reflect advancesin supercomputer capability, or any changes in the securitythreat to the U.S. or its allies, the White House said.However, indexing doesn't mean that the Mtop standard will beautomatically raised year by year, as the U.S. computerindustry has requested. &quot;We'd have to look at the marketreality,&quot; said James LeMunyon, a deputy assistant secretaryat the Commerce Department. &quot;If exports don't increase tocountries requiring safeguards, we won't have to raise thestandards.&quot;   The U.S. industry was pleased by the results. &quot;We've beenworking for an agreement like this for years,&quot; said SuzanneTichenor, Cray's director for international affairs. DebraWaggoner, a government affairs specialist for the AmericanElectronics Association, expressed hope that the accord willhelp open markets in Japan for U.S. suppliers.   The agreement also recognizes an intermediary class ofsupercomputers ranging in power from 195 to 1950 Mtops thatwill still require &quot;limited&quot; security safeguards for saleseven to other industrialized nations. IBM Corp.'s ES900/440and 480 models and Hitachi Ltd. M680 are believed to fallwithin this class. For supercomputers with a capabilitybeyond 1950 Mtops, such as the Cray four-processor YMP,certain official guarantees have to be provided by theimporting country.</TEXT></DOC>
