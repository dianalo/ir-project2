Mr. Jacobs noted that CML's forecast represents &quot;quite adifference from where they've been.&quot; He said CML, afterselling a number of businesses, &quot;can focus on fewerbusinesses without stretching beyond their means.&quot;   Since Mr. Jacobs and Minstar, a Minneapolis company heruns, bought their stake, CML has sold several businesses aspart of a restructuring. CML predicted earnings fromcontinuing operations of $1.90 to $2 a share in the fiscalyear ending July 31, although it will post a loss for theyear because of losses from discontinued operations.
