Dozens of cases heading toward the National LaborRelations Board will test whether self-directed work teams,quality circles and other joint labor-management groups areallowed under federal labor law. Such groups were designed toincrease worker participation and improve product quality,but some believe they run afoul of workers' right to formindependent labor organizations.</LP><TEXT>   A strict interpretation of the National Labor RelationsAct could force employers to disband 90% of existing groups,warns Washington attorney Robert Hunter. A case involving&quot;action committees&quot; established by Electromation Inc.,Elkhart, Ind., has reached the NLRB, but the board may holdits decision until cases involving Du Pont and the U.S.Postal Service reach it.   The stakes are enormous; the Labor Department estimatesthat at least one-third of all major companies have some formof employee participation program.                                                                                                          PRIVATE POLICE: The role of the private sector in lawenforcement grows.   Security companies spend $52 billion annually and employ1.5 million people, compared to a budget of just $30 billionand a work force of 600,000 for public law enforcementagencies, says the Justice Department's National Institute ofJustice. It projects that private security firms will spend$104 billion annually by the year 2000, compared with $44billion for public agencies.   Serious and violent crime remains a public responsibility,notes institute Director Charles DeWitt. But economic crimeslike computer offenses, copyright and trademarkinfringements, industrial espionage, fraud and employee theftand drug abuse, increasingly are settled privately. By theend of the decade, the institute says, there will be1,160,000 private-sector security personnel.                                                                                                          BANKING BUST: The merger wave and cost-cutting drive spellmass layoffs.   Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. projects bank industry job losses at250,000, or 20% of the work force, by decade's end. TheBankAmerica-Security Pacific merger alone could cut up to20,000 jobs, says Los Angeles headhunter Randall Hill. Rippleeffects are felt widely; &quot;There are a lot of bankers out onthe street,&quot; reports George Hodges, principal in theBellevue, Wash., outplacement firm Brighton Group.   Some bankers might find posts in regulatory agencies or aschief financial officers, as salesmen of financial productslike insurance or annuities, or in such fields as mailorderretailing. But many banking people will have to accept lessmoney and less-senior positions, and may have to relocate.   Many bank analysts were dismissed during last year's routin bank stocks; former Smith Barney analyst Lacy Shockleyopened a dress boutique in Wilmington, Del.                                                                                                          SEXUAL DISFAVORS: The National Association for FemaleExecutives, in a poll of 1,300 of its members, found that 53%said they were sexually harassed by people with power overtheir jobs or careers. Fully 64% didn't report the incidents,and more than half of those who did said the problem wasn'tsolved to their satisfaction.                                                                                                          FLIGHT TO QUALITY: Amidst growing doubts about safety,pension plans are accepting lower yields in return for higherquality on guaranteed investment contracts and bankinvestment contracts, according to Wyatt Co. In 1990 and1991, the consulting firm says, the spread between triple-Arated and triple-B rated GICs and BICs widened to 0.63percentage point from 0.25 percentage point.                                                                                                          SELF INTEREST may be insufficient to prompt health-carereform, judging from a Gallup poll conducted for the EmployeeBenefit Research Institute. It found that 82% of Americansrated the health care they receive &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good,&quot; butonly 33% rated the overall U.S. health care system thathighly.                                                                                                          SLEEPLESS NIGHTS: Working other than standard daytimehours takes a toll.   &quot;I don't feel quite as aggressive and rested and at easeas I did working the day,&quot; says Jace Carrington, a55-year-old shift supervisor for Texas Instruments. Anothersupervisor, 33-year-old Cleon Smith, says working odd hoursmade him &quot;dysfunctional as a parent,&quot; and he lost weightbecause he missed &quot;the big, right meals.&quot; Panduit Corp.supervisor Owen Beeken says marital problems are prevalentamong night-shift workers.   One in five Americans -- 20 million people -- now worknonstandard hours. The congressional Office of TechnologyAssessment says scientists have confirmed that such workschedules disrupt biological rhythms. But because littleresearch has been done to apply such research to theworkplace, workers generally are on their own to find ways ofcoping.   Stein Printing Co. graphic artist Steve Turner, who usesshort naps and six cups of coffee to get through the nightshift, can't fall asleep in the morning without a cup ofcoffee first.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: One recent resume-writer described the sizeof his former employer as &quot;6'1,&quot; reports Robert HalfInternational, a temporary personnel service. . . . Saintlyspouses: 61% of employed wives think the household divisionof labor is fair, yet working wives perform twice as muchhousework as their husbands, according to a survey by PennState sociologist Michael Johnson.</TEXT></DOC>
