Friday, May 29, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on ABC: &quot;The American Film Institute Salute to Barbara Stanwyck.&quot; The orphan from Brooklyn has more than achieved her once-stated goals &quot;to eat, to survive, and to have a good coat.&quot; See her honored by the industry and awarded the AFI's Life Achievement Award.    Friday, May 29, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on ABC: &quot;Alcohol andamp; Cocaine -- The Secret of Addiction.&quot; The ABC News &quot;Closeup&quot; documentary unit tends to go for the sensationalist scare tactic, no matter what the subject matter. In this case, however, it's a proper, and sobering, technique.    Sunday, May 31, 2:30-4:30 p.m. EDT; Saturday, June 6, noon-3 p.m. EDT; and Sunday, June 7, 9 a.m.-2 p.m. EDT; on NBC: The French Open Tennis Championships.

Monday, June 1, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;Blue Window.&quot; Conceived in New York's The Production Company as a group experiment in making &quot;a theatrical piece about banal behavior,&quot; this play came to life and thrived both Off Broadway and in Los Angeles, where it won the L.A. Drama Critics Award. This film version features most of the original cast, playing semi-detached young New Yorkers at a dinner party. Especially good is the chill under the chit-chat.

Shirley Jones stars as the wife of a victim, played by Len Cariou.

The names of the panelists are not yet available, but the show's producers expect to tap the resources of the conference. There will also be national hookups via radio, and an 800 number to take questions from the public.    Sunday, June 7, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: The Tony Awards. Whether you're rooting for &quot;Les Miserables&quot; or &quot;Les Liaisons Dangereuses,&quot; this live ceremony from Mark Hellinger Theatre will be nothing if not . . . well . . . tony.    Tuesday, June 9, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;Death of a Porn Queen.&quot; Feeling nice and nostalgic about Broadway and Hollywood? You won't after seeing this documentary about a young woman from Minnesota who dreamed of stardom and woke up in a nightmare of degradation and drugs.

Wednesday, June 10, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS (10-midnight on WNET/Thirteen): &quot;The Immortal Beethoven.&quot; Now that we've heard Mozart guffaw in &quot;Amadeus,&quot; we're ready for some homely detail about Ludwig -- such as the fact that he was forced to practice long hours by his disciplinarian dad. Hosted by Peter Ustinov, this lavish film portrait was shot on location in Bonn and Cologne, and features several distinguished soloists in performance with the Vienna Symphony and Philharmonic. </TEXT></DOC>
