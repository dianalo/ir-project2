It might just be talk, police spokesman Jim Jordan said, but thetalk's been persistent _ so much so that commanding officers feltthey had to warn patrol units before they went out on the streetsTuesday evening.   ``We happen to think a police officer's life is priceless, so wereject any street criminal trying to put some value on it,'' Jordansaid Wednesday.   Word of the Franklin Hill Giants gang's bounty has spreadquickly through the streets of the Roxbury, Mattapan and Dorchestersections, Jordan said, ``and people in the community feel arepugnance at the notion.''   But residents become equally alarmed when one of their own isshot under murky circumstances, which is what happened severalhours after Tuesday's roll call.   Orlando Carr, 30, was stopped for a search by two officers, oneof whom opened fire when he mistook a set of keys for a gun. He waslisted as stable Wednesday at Boston City Hospital.   Deputy Superintendent William Celester said the officer sawsomething shiny and ``feared for his life.'' Some residents seethings differently.   ``I'm just as concerned about criminal elements as anyone in thecommunity,'' said Juanita Wade, a Boston School Committee memberand Roxbury resident. ``But it's a double-edged sword.   ``You want to make sure that gang members participating inviolent activity are stopped or removed from the streets, but youalso want to make sure there's no abuse of that power.''   Carr's cousin Marva Carr said Tuesday night's shooting was anexample of abuse. She said Carr had perhaps become a victim ofrumor.   ``Maybe someone on the street said something about (a bounty),but it's the first time I've heard of it,'' she said. ``I'm on thestreet every day. I hang on the street and I don't know why Iwouldn't have heard of this.''   Nonetheless, violence against police officers has increased: Amotorcycle officer was the target of a group throwing stones thenight Carr was shot, and at least three police cruisers have comeunder gunfire during the last 1{ weeks, Jordan said.   ``We're putting (reports of a bounty) together with other thingsthat have been taking place,'' he said.   Ralph Agee, assistant executive director at the RoxburyMulti-Service Center, said he hadn't noticed a huge increase intension on the streets, ``but it may be that people have just begunto accept the tension.''   Charles C. Yancey, a city councilor who represents Mattapan andDorchester, said officers live with daily dangers and word of abounty could heighten their fears to the peril of all.   ``If they feel there are people out to kill them then they'regoing to act in a manner that would consider self-preservationfirst,'' Yancey said. ``And if these rumors have no basis in fact,then a great disservice is being done not only to the policeofficers but to the community itself.''</TEXT></DOC>
