Most of their impact will be felt in the Democratic primaries, in which nearly 90% of black votes will be cast. In those states where blacks constitute one-fourth or more of the voting-age population -- such as Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi -- the black vote could make the difference in a tight race.    In the 16 Republican primaries, however, blacks will have virtually no influence on Super Tuesday's outcome. And this is a bad thing both for blacks and for the Republican Party.    The concentrated black vote in Democratic primaries gives blacks great leverage within the party, which is what they properly seek. And since blacks don't vote in Republican primaries as a rule, they don't much care about the outcome of these contests. The result is pernicious for Republican growth: Cold political calculus argues that courting black votes in primaries is a waste of resources; but that makes appeals in the general election ring hollow.    This is especially unfortunate considering how greatly the political calculus of black votes changes in determining the outcomes of general elections. As blacks constitute only about 12% of the voting-age population, they do not exercise nearly as much leverage as they do in Democratic primaries. But in close contests between Democrats and Republicans the black vote can make the difference.    Blacks' electoral strength was borne out by the results of several key senatorial races in 1986. In Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina, Republican incumbents were ousted by Democratic challengers who claimed only about 40% of the white vote, but more than 80% of the black vote. These Senate seats enabled Democrats to take control of the Senate for the first time this decade.    It's clear that Republicans have to offer a place for blacks in their party's program if they want to win close congressional races or become the party of majority. As prospective standard bearer for their party, George Bush, Bob Dole, Jack Kemp and Pat Robertson should make an appeal in the South this week to black voters. They should assure blacks that there is still a place for them in the party of Abraham Lincoln.    &quot;I want the Republican Party to grow,&quot; said Mr. Dole at a convention of Georgia Republicans. &quot;Some asked me, 'Why did we lose four Senate seats in the South?' I'll tell you why. It'll take one minute. We didn't get the black vote. You have to deal with the realities in America. The reality is, if you spot {the Democrats} 95% {of the black vote} you have a tough row to hoe.&quot;    Fine. We are sure that Messrs. Bush, Kemp and Robertson agree with Mr. Dole's assessment. At the same time, what we have in mind is something more than merely adding &quot;the needs of black Americans&quot; to the long list of obligatory trigger words all the presidential candidates use in their campaign mantras. An effective Republican would find a way to differentiate the values of his party as a platform for black progress from the well-known Democratic alternative. Perhaps these appeals won't produce a greater number of black Republican votes on Super Tuesday, but they surely would make the row a little less tough to hoe in Novembers to come. </TEXT></DOC>
