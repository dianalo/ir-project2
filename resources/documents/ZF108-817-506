It thinks not, but stresses that choosing to pursue a migration policywas as much a business decision as one based on technology.andP;  There have beensuggestions that the increasing numbers of software companies working withIBM on AD/Cycle, and the companies in which IBM has taken an equity stake,are playing a risky game.andP;  Some commentators fear that the eventual outcomewill be a software industry dominated by IBM-determined standards.andP;  Again,Pansophic adopts a cautionary note.andP;  If you choose to go to bed with anelephant, then ask yourself how long it will be before the beast rolls over.andO;- Janice McGinn</TEXT></DOC>
