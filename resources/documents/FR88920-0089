No. 1, Box 369, Shamokin, Pennsylvania 17872has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.206 (conventionalroof support) to its 12 Vein Slope (I.D. No. 36-07773) located in NorthumberlandCounty, Pennsylvania. The petition is filed under section 101(c) of theFederal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.A summary of the petitioner's statements follows:1. The petition concerns the requirement that the width of openings belimited to 20 feet when conventional roof support is used.2. As an alternate method, petitioner reuests a modification of the standardto allow the roof in openings in excess of 20 feet in width be supportedwith conventional supports set on 5-foot centers in every direction, orbe supported by employing the full-box method.3. In support of this request, petitioner states that in anthracite minesall roadways are restricted to 12 feet in width. The breasts, on the otherhand, where mobile equipment is not used, are driven up to 30 feet in width.These breasts are supported by conventional supports placed on 5-foot centersin every direction, hence no span of roof is left unsupported. In minespitched 60 degrees or more, the breasts are driven full. In the full-boxmethod, manways are timbered 30-inches wide and loose coal supports theroof between the manway timbers.4. Petitioner further states that roof bolts would create a hazard in steeplypitched mines, because they would have to be installed from 30 degreesto as little as 2 degrees from horizontal. This would result in shearingof the bolts.5. For these reasons, petitioner requests a modification of the standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments</ITAG>Persons interested in this petition may furnish written comments.
