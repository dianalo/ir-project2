John J. Maresca added, however, that NATO and the Warsaw Pactstill disagreed on whether naval and air forces should be included.Maresca is chief U.S. delegate to the 35-nation talks on enhancingsecurity in Europe.   ``I believe that these negotiations are now well positioned tomove forward,'' he told fellow negotiators at the beginning of thethird round of talks. ``However, we must be realistic.''   ``The common ground which has emerged over the first two roundscan only lead to an early positive conclusion if proposals which areunlikely to attract consensus are put aside. This will undoubtedlybe the most difficult task before us,'' he said.   A copy of his speech was made available to The Associated Press.   Soviet negotiators insist that naval and air forces be included,but NATO says they never were meant to be part of the negotiationsand would further complicate an already complex task.   ``Nobody can conduct a war in Europe with naval forces. ... Warcan take place only on land,'' Maresca told a news conference afterthe closed negotiating session.   Maresca said de facto agreement has been reached in some areas atthe talks, which involve the 16 members of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization, the seven-nation Warsaw Pact and 12 countries that areneutral or profess non-alignment.   Running parallel in Vienna are NATO-Warsaw Pact negotiations onreducing conventional forces in Europe, which resumed Thursday.   ``The principle of a regular exchange of information has now, Ibelieve, been broadly accepted,'' but still to be worked out are howto set up a data bank and what information to share on troopdeployments, weapons procurement and other military subjects,Maresca told the reporters.   ``A breakthrough has been made with acceptance in principle thatthere should be such an exchange,'' he said. ``This represents animportant step forward which can only have a positive effect on therange of arms control talks currently under way.''   NATO suggested such an exchange at negotiations in early June.   Maresca said there also appeared to be agreement in principle fora seminar on military policies, which he described as ``the firstmultilateral government-to-government exchange on military policiesever held.''</TEXT></DOC>
