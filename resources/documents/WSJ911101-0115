The technique uses a high-speed version of magneticresonance imaging, or MRI, coupled with so-called contrastagents, harmless injected compounds that stand out in MRIimages. The method, reported in today's issue of Science, wasdeveloped at Massachusetts General Hospital by John W.Belliveau and colleagues using MRI machines developed byAdvanced NMR Systems Inc., Woburn, Mass.</LP><TEXT>   MRI machines use strong magnetic fields and radio waves tomake pictures of internal organs without X-rays orradioactive materials. The latest MRI machines make picturesin a fraction of a second -- the speed required for the newbrain imaging method.   The method is based on the fact that higher volumes ofblood flow through active regions of the brain, providingglucose and oxygen to working brain cells. The Bostonresearchers highlighted these localized blood surges byinjecting the contrast agent into research subjects whilestimulating their visual systems with flashing patterns oflight. By comparing MRI images made before and after thestimulation as the agent flowed through the subjects' brains,the scientists produced pictures showing the activation of abrain area involved in vision.   Similar brain-function images can be made with positronemission tomography, or PET, scanners. But PET images costmore than MRI pictures and require the injection ofradioactive tracers. Moreover, the new method yields moredetailed anatomical images than PET scanners do, the Bostonresearchers said.   They added that the new technique is being tested inbrain-tumor diagnosis and treatment -- it enables doctors tosee whether treatments are working, because blood flow toareas of cancerous growth lessens when the tumors shrink.Additionally, brain scientists say the new technique promisesmany insights on how normal brains work.   Paul Bullinger, president of Advanced NMR, said thecompany next month will begin delivering retrofit equipmentfor MRI machines, priced at $535,000 a machine, that enablesfast imaging with General Electric Co. MRI scanners. A numberof large medical institutions have expressed interest inbuying the retrofits, partly because of the newbrain-scanning possibilities, he added.</TEXT></DOC>
