(ISI) of Santa Clara, Calif., for use in designingreal-time control systems for NASA's Space Station Freedom.andM;The contract, which was announced earlier this month, will supply theHuntsville Division with ISI's Application Generator (AG), an Ada version ofthe company's AC-100 software development and simulation system.andM;The AG system allows software developers to model the control systemgraphically, using a DEC workstation to simulate a fully coded, real-timecontrol process running on an Intel 80386-based computer system.andM;The AG system is intended to let software developers refine the design of theproposed control system before committing to the actual work of writing code.andM;Huntsville engineers will use the ISI technology to build Space StationFreedom's living quarters, laboratory and storage modules, as well as nodesthat connect the modules.andM;In a separate contract, Boeing Co. officials have selected DMR Group ofBoston to supply a software system for automating and organizing productmanagement, acquisition, development and prototyping activities at Boeing'sSeattle facilities.andM;A DMR spokesman said the Boeing contract will consist initially of severalpilot programs within various Boeing divisions.andP;  Each pilot program carries avalue of approximately $50,000, according to the spokesman.andM;The DMR system, called Productivity Plus, runs across multiple platforms,reflecting the heavy investment in both IBM and DEC hardware at Boeing'sSeattle plant, the spokesman said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
