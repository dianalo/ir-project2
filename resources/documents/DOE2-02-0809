The mesocosms, located at the Marine Ecosystem ResearchLaboratory (MERL), Narragansett, RI, were part of a nutrient gradientexperiment designed to investigate the effects of water column nutrientloading on the chemistry and biology of these systems. The nutrient loadingincreased productivity, which in turn resulted in additional carbon reachingthe sediments. This increase in sediment carbon fueled sulfate reductionwhich increased the reducing potential of the sediments (figures 1b+c,2b+c). Thus these mesocosms were ideal systems in which to study thedistribution of interstitial total (T-Cr) and organic chromium (SP-Cr)under a variety of redox environments.</TEXT></DOC>
