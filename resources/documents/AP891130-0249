(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sikorsky Aircraft said it will lay offabout 150 hourly workers Friday in part because of shrinking U.S.and international defense spending.   The layoffs, announced Wednesday in a notice posted at fourcompany plants in Connecticut, will be the first in Sikorsky'sblue-collar work force since February 1988, when the helicopterbuilder laid off 19 hourly workers.   Sikorsky, a division of Hartford-based United Technologies Inc.,laid off 350 salaried workers in July, a 6 percent cut in itssalaried ranks.   ``This employee reduction must be made to remain competitive inthe face of shrinking worldwide defense budgets in the years tocome,'' Sikorsky Vice President John A. Carpino said in the notice.   He also said that ``future production of U.S. militaryhelicopters will be reduced below anticipated levels despite strongCongressional support for Sikorsky's programs during the currentbudget cycle.''   Wolfgang Demish, a defense industry analyst with UBS Securitiesin New York, said the company will likely be forced to considerfurther reductions.   ``To the extent that there's a relaxation of military tensionsworldwide, the demand for military helicopters worldwide is goingdown. Sikorsky remains at risk of further cuts,'' he said.   The layoffs will leave Sikorsky with a total work force of about12,650, including 6,550 hourly workers, company spokesman LarryBingaman said.   The notice said Sikorsky will continue to assess employmentlevels in light of its projected work load. Bingaman declined tosay if the company expects further layoffs.   ``I don't think many people are projecting an increase in thedefense budget, either in the United States or internationally, inthe years to come,'' he said.   Although it has tried to boost sales of its commercialhelicopter, the S-76, more than 80 percent of Sikorsky's salescontinue to be military. The company also has been pushing foreignsales of its U.S. military aircraft.   Foreign sales represented only 6 percent of the company's salesfive years ago but are expected to represent 25 percent this year,Bingaman said.</TEXT></DOC>
