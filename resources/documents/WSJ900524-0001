Charles D. Barnett, 39 years old, had been charged withone count of conspiracy and six counts of fraud in connectionwith the alleged scheme. But in a defeat for federalprosecutors -- and for Ashland, whose private investigatorfirst brought the allegations to the attention of prosecutors-- the jury said Mr. Barnett had committed no crime.</LP><TEXT>   Instead, several jurors, speaking after the verdict wasread, said the jury decided that Ashland cheated theIranians. Based on the judge's instructions, the jurorscouldn't convict Mr. Barnett if they believed Ashland hadcommitted fraud or deceit against Iran.   The U.S. alleged the scheme to sell the documents arosewhen Orin Atkins, who was forced to resign as Ashlandchairman in 1981, became hard-pressed for money. Mr. Atkinspleaded guilty last year to conspiracy and wire fraud andagreed to cooperate with prosecutors.   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, N.Y., called Mr.Atkins, formerly a close friend of Mr. Barnett's father, totestify against the lawyer.   Roy Furmark, an oil broker and middleman in the Reaganadministration's arms sales to Iran, also pleaded guilty toconspiracy for his role in the Ashland scheme and cooperatedwith prosecutors.   Prosecutors alleged that Iran planned to use the stolendocuments in a civil suit it filed against Ashland in 1985for failure to pay for oil that Iran delivered to it; underthe alleged scheme, in return for the documents Iran wouldpay Mr. Barnett and others a cut of any damages it won. Inthe oil-delivery case, the Iranian oil company sued Ashlandfor $780 million in damages, and settled the case last yearwhen Ashland agreed to pay $325 million.   A spokesman for the Ashland, Ky., company said the Barnettprosecution &quot;was a criminal case brought by the governmentinvolving matters in which two persons have already pleadedguilty and Ashland was the victim. Any statement that Ashlanddefrauded the Iranians is ludicrous. Even the Iranians, in a10-year dispute . . ., never made that allegation.&quot;   &quot;It's been two years out of my life,&quot; said Mr. Barnett,who plans to return to his corporate and real-estate lawpractice in West Palm Beach. &quot;I never thought I was guilty ofanything. I didn't understand why the others pleaded guilty.&quot;   Marvin B. Segal, Mr. Barnett's lawyer, argued in courtthat his client was performing a legitimate legal service forthe Iranian company, rather than conspiring in an illegalscheme. After the verdict, several jurors spent about an hourdiscussing the case with Mr. Segal and other lawyers. Mr.Segal said jurors were most concerned about &quot;what Ashland haddone and what they saw as a fraud committed by Ashland. . . .Their position is, why isn't the government going afterAshland?&quot;   Herve Gouraige, the assistant U.S. attorney who prosecutedthe case, said, &quot;We accept the jury's verdict,&quot; but declinedto comment further.   Mr. Atkins and Mr. Furmark are scheduled to be sentencednext month.   ---   STEPTOE andamp; JOHNSON will create Moscow office as jointventure with Soviets.   Although other U.S. law firms have established Moscowoffices, the Steptoe andamp; Johnson venture will be the first lawoffice run jointly by Americans and Soviets. Apco Associates,a unit of Arnold andamp; Porter, has a joint venture with theSoviets, but Apco technically isn't a law firm but a law-firmsubsidiary engaged in non-legal consulting.   The Steptoe venture, named InterLex, will be staffed byU.S. and Soviet lawyers. Steptoe Managing Partner RobertJordan said Sarah Carey, who became a Steptoe partner afterleaving the now-defunct Heron Burchette Ruckert andamp; Rothwell,was instrumental in setting up the venture, and would serveas its chairwoman. He said InterLex's clients would includecompanies that sell computer equipment and such raw materialsas oil and metals. He declined to name any.   Mr. Jordan said the new law office, which he expects to bein operation within 30 days, would seek to provide clientswith access to Soviet officials. &quot;Sometimes that has a nastyconnotation,&quot; he said, but more often it simply means&quot;knowing people.&quot; Among InterLex's employees will be IrinaSavelyeva, who according to a Steptoe news release was &quot;aprincipal author of the new Soviet copyright-protectionlegislation.&quot; Asked whether the concept of the &quot;revolvingdoor&quot; is being introduced to the Soviet Union, Mr. Jordansaid Ms. Savelyeva didn't have a &quot;formal position&quot; with theSoviet government.   But Mr. Jordan didn't rule out hiring former Sovietofficials in the future: &quot;I suppose anything is possible.&quot;   ---   LAW FIRM EXPANSION slowed in 1989 at 500 largest firms,survey finds.   Amid slower overall growth in the economy and a decline inmajor corporate transactions, the nation's largest law firmsappear to be more cautious about taking on new partners andassociates. The 500 largest firms grew 7.7% in 1989, comparedwith growth of 9.2% in 1988 and 9.9% in 1987, according tothe survey conducted by Of Counsel, a publication of PrenticeHall Law andamp; Business.   But growth continued unabated at the so-called megafirms.Chicago-based Baker andamp; McKenzie, which remains the nation'slargest law firm, expanded 15%, to 1,487 lawyers from 1,294.The next largest, Cleveland's Jones, Day, Reavis andamp; Pogue,grew 22% to 1,150 lawyers. New York's Skadden, Arps, Slate,Meager andamp; Flom reached 1,032 lawyers, up more than 10%.   While most of the firms surveyed expanded modestly lastyear, 83 shrank in size. The slowed expansion overall appearsto reflect declining demand for legal work, rising expensesfor office overhead, and growing corporate use of in-houselawyers.   Many of the firms in the survey indicated that theirreluctance to take on new lawyers could continue through1990, particularly if the slump in high-paying mergers andacqusitions work continues.   &quot;I don't think we're going to see a comeback&quot; this year,said Paul Roy, a partner at the legal consulting firmHildebrandt Inc., of Somerville, N.J.   ---   CONVICTIONS of lawyer and accountant in collapse ofLandbank Equity upheld.   The federal appeals in Richmond, Va., denied appeals onbehalf of Frank E. Butler III, a lawyer and co-founder ofLandbank Equity Corp. and Owen R. Thornton thesecond-mortgage lender's former accountant. Landbank, ofVirginia Beach, Va., and once among the largestsecond-mortgage companies in the nation, collapsed in 1985leaving more than $100 million in debts.   Messrs. Thornton and Butler were convicted of multiplefraud and racketeering counts for falsifying creditapplications, doctoring financial statements andmisappropriating loan proceeds.   Both began serving prison terms in January 1989 butappealed on grounds that their jury was tainted when theirco-defendant, a former Landbank vice-president, committedsuicide after the jury was impaneled. The appeal judgesupheld a lower court's refusal to grant a mistrial.   The judge in the case, J. Calvitt Clarke Jr., polledjurors individually before allowing the trial to continue.   ---   UNIVERSITY SUES NEA, claiming new grant requirements areunconstitutional.   Last year, Congress passed a law requiring grantrecipients to certify that none of the funds will be used topromote &quot;materials which in the judgment of the NationalEndowment for the Arts may be considered obscene.&quot; The lawwas adopted amid controversy over NEA funding of certainexhibitions, such as the work of the late photographer RobertMapplethorpe.   In its suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the NewSchool for Social Research said the new restrictions violategrant recipients' rights to free speech and due process. Thesuit said the obscenity requirement is too vague to beconstitutional. The school recently won a $45,000 grant tohelp fund a sculpture garden, but it has refused to sign therequired certification as a matter of principle, said FloydAbrams, attorney for the school.   Mr. Abrams said the suit is the first challenging theconstitutionality of the new restrictions.   He said it will require the court to determine &quot;whetherthe NEA can require the surrender of First Amendment rightsas the price-tag for a grant.&quot;   ---   Edward Felsenthal contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
