However, a few of them are already in use in clinical practice afteryears of research and development efforts. The capabilities of thesesystems to reason symbolically and to mimic the hypothetico-deductiveprocesses used by physicians distinguishes them from conventional computerprograms. Their power comes from their knowledge-base which embeds alarge quantity of high-level, specialized knowledge captured from medicalexperts. Common methods for knowledge representation include productionrules and frames. These methods also provide a mean for organizing andstructuring the knowledge according to hierarchical or causal links.The best expert-systems perform at the level of the experts. They areeasy to learn and use, and can communicate with the user in pseudo-naturallanguage. Moreover they are able to explain their line of reasoning.These capabilities make them potentially useful, usable and acceptableby physicians. However if the problems related to difficulties and costsin building expert-systems are on the way to be solved within the nextfew years, forensic and ethical issues should have to be addressed beforeone can envisage their routine use in clinical practice.</TEXT></DOC>
