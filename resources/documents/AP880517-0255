LONDON (AP) _ Britain's major commercial banks announced onTuesday they would cut their base lending rate by half a percentagepoint to 7.5 percent, heeding a signal from the central bank whichwas an apparent effort to stem the strong pound.   The recent strength in the pound has caused a reported rift inthe government.   National Westminster Bank PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, Lloyds BankPLC and Midland Bank PLC cut the benchmark borrowing rate,effective Wednesday, after the central bank cut its money-marketdealing rate to 7.5 percent from 7~ percent.   The pound plunged on the news, which surprised the markets.   It was quoted at $1.8740 and 3.1550 West German marks, down from$1.8810 and below 3.18 marks just before the central bank announcedits move at about midday.   The latest cut brings the base lending rate to its lowest levelsince April 1978, Natwest said. The base rate previously was cut onApril 8, when it was lowered half a point to 8 percent.   Corporate borrowers can obtain loans at one percentage pointabove the base lending rate.   The Bank of England's move came when sterling actually wasweakening a bit on on unconfirmed reports that Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher, an advocate of free-market policies, would backChancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's desire for a moremanaged exchange rate.   Mrs. Thatcher, who has expressed concern that sustainedintervention could fuel inflation, was to answer questions in theHouse of Commons later in the day, and she was likely to bequestioned closely on exchange rate policy. Mrs. Thatcherrepeatedly has cited fighting inflation as her main economic aim.   Lawson suppports curtailing the pound through interest rate cutsand central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets. Astrong pound could hurt British exports and corporate profits.</TEXT></DOC>
