Mr. Greenspan wouldn't be specific, saying he didn't wantto talk publicly about options that may turn out to be&quot;impractical or infeasible.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But he did speak about the difficulty of properly valuingreal estate in the current economic environment, a key issuefor banks and their regulators. And the Fed has been workingwith other bank regulators on possible changes to the waybanks account for loans that appear to be going sour.   &quot;One way {to address the credit crunch} is to bring theFed funds {interest} rate down lower, but we're looking atother ways to restore a modicum of rational lending whendealing with credit-worthy customers,&quot; he said.   Mr. Greenspan said again that bankers' reluctance to lendis disrupting the normal mechanism by which the Fed pumpscredit into the banking system to increase the money supplyand spur economic activity. If not undone, this credit crunchcould prolong the recession.   The Fed chairman acknowledged the possibility that bankregulators have been unduly pessimistic in valuing realestate, noting that the best estimate may not be the pricethat a property would bring in the current depressed market.   Earlier in the week, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that onereason for the credit crunch is that bankers fear thatregulators are more likely to classify loans as bad. &quot;I hopethat we can find ways in which to either disabuse them ofthat notion -- if it in fact is false -- or to alter it tothe extent that it is not,&quot; he said.   In response to bankers' complaints, officials from theFed, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. have been considering accounting changes thatwould allow banks to report lower amounts of nonperformingloans, smaller loan-loss reserves and higher profits.   Currently, if a bank lends $1 million to a developer andbank examiners decide that the bank is likely to get backonly $800,000, the entire amount is classified as a bad loanand a certain fraction of the total must be set aside as aloan-loss reserve and deducted from the bank's profit.   The proposal under discussion would allow the bank towrite off $200,000 and keep the remaining $800,000 on thebooks as a good loan, one regulator said. This would bothreduce the large amounts of nonperforming loans on bankbalance sheets and send another signal to banks thatregulators want them to keep lending.   On another front to help ease the credit crunch, the FDICis in the midst of intense discussions with bankers over waysto head off bank failures and to bolster shaky banks withcapital infusions.   The discussions are part of an effort &quot;to aid the bankingsystem in its job of providing sufficient credit to theeconomy,&quot; FDIC Chairman William Seidman said.   Mr. Seidman called banking representatives to his officethis week and implored them to come up with an industry planto raise more money for the bank deposit insurance fund andcreate a new fund to keep poorly capitalized banks fromfailing. The bankers are looking at several ways to attractmore investment into banks that are judged to be basicallysound but temporarily undercapitalized.   Bankers met at the FDIC for most of Tuesday and yesterdayand have begun to agree on the elements of a plan. Mr.Seidman said they are narrowing their differences andexpressed hope that they will reach an accord by the end ofthe week.   Whether all or part of the new program will requireenactment by Congress &quot;is still to be decided&quot; and willdepend on the elements of the agreement, Mr. Seidman said.The administration and Congress are counting on the bankingindustry to live up to its promise to develop a plan forprotecting the bank insurance fund. Officials say PresidentBush hopes to be able to refer to the resolution of thisproblem in his State of the Union message next week, when heis also expected to outline his administration's proposal formodernizing the banking industry.   ---   Kenneth H.
