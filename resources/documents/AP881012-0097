Pilot Richard Covey said Tuesday that although he had flownbefore, he still was ``a bit taken aback'' by the power of therockets that thrust the shuttle into orbit Sept. 29.   ``It was a very, very long 8{ minutes'' until the main enginecut off, Covey said during the crew's first post-flight newsconference at the Johnson Space Center. ``I think we all felt thatway.''   ``I'm sure we were all thinking, to some degree, about the factthat the last time this had been attempted, it wasn't successful.You never forget that,'' he said.   The Challenger explosion, which occurred 73 seconds afterliftoff on Jan. 28, 1986, and killed all seven astronauts aboard,was blamed on a faulty booster rocket. The rockets were redesignedand NASA officials have found no damage in the new boosters.   Despite the anxious moments, Discovery's astronauts praised theshuttle's performance and its success in putting Americans backinto space.   ``We can look back on a flight that as far as I'm concerned waspicture perfect,'' said Discovery commander Frederick Hauck, whoannounced the mission would be his last. Hauck, a Navy captain,said he is considering what he will do next, but said he has notresigned from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.   ``I don't think we have any ghosts hovering above us anymore,''Hauck said, referring to doubts cast on the space agency because ofthe Challenger explosion.   During an appearance today on ``CBS This Morning,'' Covey wasasked how NASA was changed by the Discovery mission.   ``I think the main changes we've seen within NASA are acommitment to quality, a commitment to safety that we didn't havequite as much emphasis on prior to the Challenger accident and anincrease in communications between all the elements of NASA,''Covey said.   During the four-day mission, Hauck, Covey, John M. Lounge, DavidC. Hilmers and George D. ``Pinky'' Nelson deployed a $100 millioncommunications satellite, tested shuttle systems and conducted 11experiments before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., onOct. 3.   Although a detailed account of the mission showed a few minorproblems, including trouble with a cooling system, the onlycomplaint the astronauts had Tuesday concerned the bulky pressuresuits worn during launch and landing.   While watching a 20-minute film about the flight that includedshots of the astronauts getting into the 75-pound suits beforelanding, Nelson said, ``It hurts just to watch it.''   Nelson said that although the suits, which are part of a newescape system, are ``pretty uncomfortable,'' a few modificationssuch as a better fan and a less bulky harness could improve them.   During the mission, Discovery's crew members broadcast anemotional message in memory of the seven Challenger astronautswhile a camera on the shuttle showed a view of the Earth.   Hilmers, who came up with the memorial, said he wanted those onthe ground to see the pictures of Earth to help understand whyothers want to travel in space.   ``I thought at that time we were really linked closelytogether,'' he said. ``I felt a lot closer (to the Challengervictims) then than maybe ever before. We really wanted to show theworld that we were standing up there for them and their sacrificewasn't in vain.''</TEXT></DOC>
