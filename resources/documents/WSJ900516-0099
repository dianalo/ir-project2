Later it became clearthat Soviet troops moved in only after the ethnic riots hadbeen allowed to run their course, and that in all likelihoodthe ethnic tensions had been deliberately stirred by at leastsome elements among Soviet authorities. These points weremade forcefully by, among others, world chess champion GaryKasparov, who rescued his Armenian relatives from Azerbaijan.   Yesterday, in both Latvia and Estonia, which had recentlydeclared their independence from the Soviet Union, there wereclashes between Russians and non-Russians in front of thecountries' respective parliament buildings. In a recentinterview in New York with the editors of The Wall StreetJournal, a leader of the Estonian independence movement drewour attention to the Russian nationalist group calledInterfront, which has appeared in a number of Sovietrepublics. On Monday, a helicopter over the Latvian capitalof Riga dropped leaflets, signed by Interfront. Here is thefull text of the document:</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Let us rise up in defense of Soviet power in Latvia. Thetime for orators has passed. It is time to go over from wordsto deeds.   &quot;Our fate is being decided today. The honor andself-respect of the Soviet person does not give us the rightto hide behind the backs of those who are fighting for ourfuture. Let disdain and shame cover the descendants of thosewho in this decisive hour do not come out againstcounter-revolution. Men -- look into the eyes of yourchildren, mothers and wives. Can you leave them defenseless?   &quot;At 10 o'clock, May 15, 1990, stop the factories andplants and come out into the streets of the city. Altogetherwe will go to the buildings of the Supreme Soviet with thedemand for the re-establishment of Soviet power in therepublic. Let the handful of traitors and politicaladventurers who are making decisions for us hear the voice ofthe working people.   &quot;Long live the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic.&quot;   ---   Even before these events, Baltic leaders had come tosuspect that the similarity and professionalism of Interfrontactivities suggest that it is pretty much run by Sovietintelligence. This time, the people of the West should atleast allow the possibility that the Baltic &quot;unrest&quot; isn'tspontaneous but is instead the strategy Moscow is using tolay the justification for armed suppression of the empire'sspreading independence movements.   We don't deny the possibility that there could be tensionsin the Baltic republics between some Russians andnon-Russians. However, with Secretary of State Baker even nowin Moscow preparing for the impending Bush-Gorbachev summit,we do not see why the West's leaders and editorialists shouldcontinue to accord Mr. Gorbachev deference in his offensivesagainst these democratic independence movements.   In their May 4 declaration of independence, the Latviansbent over backward to accommodate Mr. Gorbachev's insistenceon a go-slow process, without confrontation. In return, theSoviet leader Monday night declared Latvia's and Estonia'sMarch 30 independence declarations &quot;null and void.&quot; Now wehave the spectacle of several thousand off-duty Sovietsoldiers pushing people around in front of the Latvianparliament, and reports of 2,000 Russians storming theEstonian legislature in Riga. They were turned back by about15,000 Estonians. We hope that in the days ahead some thoughtis given to the possibility that these &quot;tensions&quot; are notsome agentless event but are instead occurring by design.   It is now clear that Mr. Gorbachev's earlier economicsanctions against Lithuania have only encouraged the effortsof the three Baltic states to gain independence from Moscow.Over the weekend, they aligned themselves with each other byre-establishing the Council of Baltic States, first formed in1934 when the Baltic nations were independent states.   It seems likely that they will continue seeking allianceswith reform movements elsewhere. Indeed, just a week agoSunday in Kiev, &quot;people's-front&quot; groups from eight Sovietrepublics met to create the Union of Democratic Forces. Itspurpose, said the Ukrainian group Rukh, is &quot;to help republicsquit the U.S.S.R. . . . and to ensure the empire disbandspeacefully.&quot;   The events in Estonia and Latvia yesterday were notpeaceful. It would be unfortunate if the authorities inMoscow, beset by an economy that is failing, could devise nobetter nearterm policy than to destabilize their ownrepublics and use the army to successively impose an&quot;Armenian peace&quot; on each of them. Yet this is the path weseem to be on, with the big remaining question one of timing.Will the Red Army move in Talinn and Riga before or after Mr.Gorbachev and Mr. Bush trade toasts and smiles at the WhiteHouse?</TEXT></DOC>
