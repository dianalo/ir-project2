The safety test will involve 70 patients with AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, at St. Stephens and Westminster hospitals in London, and at a Veterans Administration hospital in New York.    The technique, known as passive immunotherapy, involves taking blood plasma from people who test positive for antibodies and have developed high levels of them in their blood. The plasma will be drawn and treated with an anti-viral drug and heat, and then infused into the AIDS patients once a month for at least a year.    Abraham Karpas of Cambridge University in England developed the technique and licensed it to Medicorp, the company said. Initial tests involving four patients at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge turned up no toxicity. Two of the patients died 11 months and 15 months after therapy, respectively; two are still alive after 24 months, according to Jack Snyder, senior vice president of Medicorp, who called the results &quot;encouraging.&quot;    Others were skeptical of the approach, however. A spokeswoman at the National Insitutes of Health said some immunologists believe passive immunotherapy has &quot;not much rationality for AIDS, because we don't know the function of antibodies, especially since many infected people with antibodies in their blood often go on to develop the disease anyway.&quot;    Antibodies are proteins produced by the body's immune system as a part of its defense against foreign microbes. </TEXT></DOC>
