(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Automated Storage Draws InterestandM;Just over 25 years ago, Bank of Boston moved its computers, programmers,keypunch operators--its entire back office operation--out of the city'sfinancial district to one of its residential neighborhoods, Dorchester.andP;  Itsfront office, meanwhile, remained in downtown Boston.andM;One of the oldest and largest banks in the United States, Bank of Boston atthe time was a pioneer, recognizing before most other users that the termback office was a misnomer.andP;  A back office, the bank realized, didn't have tobe in back of anything.andP;  So it hauled programmers, analysts and other ISoperations personnel off to Dorchester and switched systems suppliers fromHoneywell Inc. to IBM during the trip.andM;Bob Parsons, an avuncular native Bostonian and one of the top fiveindividuals in charge of the Bank of Boston's IS operations, has seen theDorchester office grow from a single building housing a few hundred employeesinto a campus of five facilities employing 1,600.andP;  The consulting systemsengineer remembers the changeover from Honeywell to IBM as the bank's biggestIS project ever.andM;That is, until now.andP;  The pioneering spirit has again been rekindled at thebank as it attempts to convert to System-Managed Storage (SMS), a term thatbasically means taking the management of storage out of human hands.andP;  Parsonsfeels the conversion is as far-reaching in its implications as any the bankhas undertaken in the last 25 years--as much in terms of its businessobjectives as for its technical hurdles.andP;  If the bank can become a convert,it can efficiently broaden its business horizons.andP;  Storage management, infact, could enable the bank to acquire other banks far more easily than ithas in the past.andM;Making Storage DecisionsandM;Bank of Boston's main data processing today is performed by a pair of IBM3090-400E mainframes and one 3090-600S model.andP;  The bank is using SMS, a termcoined by IBM in 1988, to automate and centralize the management of thestorage facilities--748 disk drives storing 900 gigabytes of data in two datacenters.andM;SMS is a set of software products and a series of policies and procedures fordata management.andP;  Instead of a storage administrator, a system programmer oreven a user allocating a specific disk drive to a given application,allocation decisions can be made on the fly by the system based on theavailability of space on disks.andP;  SMS makes it possible for the system tomonitor storage levels continuously day and night to determine the optimaluse of storage space.andP;  And SMS brings storage management down to the data setlevel, a finer gradation than was ever before possible.andM;Parsons believes SMS will help rein in storage costs--15% of the bank's $57million 1989 IS budget--by reducing the number of people assigned to storageadministration and by squeezing every possible byte out of existing storagefacilities.andP;  The bank's goal in 1990 is to free up 90 gigabytes--about 10% ofthe bank's existing storage.andM;When SMS users like Bank of Boston talk about using SMS to free up or savedisk space, they really mean it will make more efficient use of the diskspace they already have.andP;  For example, without SMS, a user's applicationsmight appear to consume 100 gigabytes of disk space; using it, those sameapplications may consume only 90 gigabytes--freeing up 10 gigabytes for newapplications.andM;Last year, Parsons got his first chance to see SMS do its stuff.andP;  The bankput its application development system under SMS.andP;  The conversion affected400 users, took six weekends and involved more than 80,000 data sets.andP;  Theresults to date: storage utilization in the application system was increasedfrom 72 to 90% without any loss of performance, and two storageadministrators were freed to do other things.andM;&quot;It was only an incremental boost for us because we were already paying a lotof attention to how we manage storage,&quot; explains John Petrella, the projectleader of the SMS effort and a 10-year veteran of the bank's IS department.andO;&quot;The real big boost is going to be for people who were managing storagemanually, or not at all.&quot;andM;The Storage ConundrumandM;SMS is IBM's response to a problem that faces every major IS facility today:as the cost of storage drops, the cost of managing it rises.andP;  Even thoughdisk drive prices are continually going down, the cost of managing those diskdrives--people, floor space, electricity--is always on the rise.andM;Storage management is not only costing more it's also a managerial blackhole.andP;  When storage is managed manually, there's really no single way to doit right.andP;  That's because once a physical disk space is assigned to oneapplication, there's no easy way to make it available to any otherapplication.andP;  &quot;You could have one application blow up because it runs out ofspace, while unused space exists but is not accessible to it,&quot; explainedPetrella.andP;  A typical IS organization has anywhere from 30 to 45% of allon-line storage sitting empty.andM;In the past, when IS managers ran out of storage space they simply boughtmore DASD, the common acronym given to direct access storagedevices--magnetic disks that can cost up to $275,000 apiece.andP;  But now there'sanother reason to think twice about just buying more DASD: the cost ofconverting to new storage hardware.andP;  When manufacturers introduce newstorage, it's a headache for IS staffs because they must rewrite programs tofit new hardware configurations.andM;Conversion also is an issue for manufacturers.andP;  In fact, it may have stymiedinnovation in storage technology thinks Jim Porter, president of Disk/TrendInc.andP;  &quot;Manufacturers now have to go to insance lengths to make their newdevices logically similar to their old devices,&quot; says Porter, whose marketresearch firm is in Mountain View, Calif.andM;Enter SMS, a way to centralize and automate the control of storage and createan open environment for the introduction of new hardware.andP;  SMS, as a formalset of products, was announced by IBM in 1988 when it introduced itsEnterprise Systems Architecture/370 (ESA/370) extensions to the MVS operatingsystem.andP;  Customers got SMS a year later.andM;SMS' most dynamic feature is a series of English-like constructs, calledAutomatic Class Selection (ACS) routines, which makes it easier and moreefficient for a storage administrator to specify how data should be managed.andM;Automating the control of storage isn't new.andP;  Software programs designed totackle various aspects of the storage problem have been around since the1970s from both IBM and its competitors.andP;  They were ahead of Big Blue untilthe SMS announcement, according to Nick Allen, a storage analyst with theGartner Group Inc. in Stamford, Conn.andP;  &quot;From a product point of view, IBM isnow definitely in the running,&quot; Allen says.andM;Although the ostensible goal of SMS is to help users get more out of theirhardaware, it may clear the way for IBM to sell more hardware.andP;  &quot;SMS willhelp IBM move iron faster by making it easier to connect a device of adifferent geometry&quot; Allen says, referring to the different track widths bywhich disks store data.andM;Trade-offs Demanded by SMSandM;But implementing SMS involves trade-offs that not every IS organization willbe willing to accept.andP;  Because the concept involves centralized control overstorage located in the system, SMS removes certain prerogatives from users.andO;After SMS is implemented, no one can point to a disk drive and say: That's myDASD.&quot;andP;  And because it brings the control over storage down to the data setlevel, it encourages a level of standardization in data set naming that maynot sit well in every IS shop.andM;To win support for SMS at Bank of Boston, Parsons and Petrella did extensivemarketing both to end users and top management.andP;  In their pitch, theyemphasized that SMS is much more than a glass house efficiency measure.andP;  Theysold it as a key underpinning to the bank's corporate strategy for the 1990s.andM;Like many other financial institutions, Bank of Boston undewent a majortransformation during the last decade.andP;  For years it was both a basicconsumer bank for the boston area and a major player in national andinternational corporate finance.andP;  In the late 1980s, however, the bank wasreborn as one of the new breed of superregional banks.andP;  Since 1983, whenMassachusetts lifted its restrictions on interstate bank mergers, Bank ofBoston has nearly doubled in size through acquisitions of banks inConnecticut, Maine, Rhode Island and Vermont.andM;Today it is the 14th largest bank in the United States with $37 billion inassets offering more than 70 kinds of financial services, from basic checkingaccounts to corporate cash management.andP;  The bank has more than 250 branchoffices in New England and maintains a network of corporate lending officesacross the United States, as well as branches in 25 countries around theworld.andM;Bank of Boston also saw some of the downside of banking in the 1980s.andP;  In1987, it wrote off $200 million in loans to developing countries.andP;  LastSeptember, the bank recorded a $125 million loss for its third quarter aftersetting aside $370 million in reserves to cover anticipated increases introubled real estate loans.andP;  At the direction of the U.S.andP;  comptroller of thecurrency, the bank is strengthening controls on its operations.andM;In the old days, when banking was largely a matter of local monopolies andpersonal relationships, banks all offered basically the same products.andP;  Butbecause banks now compete directly with each other and with other differenttypes of financial institutions, marketing and customer service are moreimportant than ever before.andP;  Banks today are constantly looking for newmarket niches and trying to beat their competitors with new products.andP;  Theirability to be profitable often boils down to one thing: minimizingtransaction costs to deliver a service as inexpensively as possible.andM;Getting a Competitive EdgeandM;Parsons and Petrella believe SMS can play a vital role in reaching that goal.andO;They have spread the word that buying fewer disk drives and hiring fewerstorage administrators will enable the bank to deliver more services lessexpensively.andM;Ultimately, however, SMS may deliver its biggest gains by supportingacquisitions--which are expected to remain a big part of the bank's corporatestrategy in the '90s.andP;  Buying another bank inevitably means buying another ISdepartment, and that means buying a lot of storage space that may not beneeded.andP;  Parsons believes SMS will enable the bank to see right away whatstorage is really needed and what can be jettisoned.andM;Parsons has already had the opportunity to test his theory.andP;  When Bank ofBoston boosted the DASD utilization in its application development systemfrom 72 to 90%, the extra space was allocated to the application developmentsystem at the Rhode Island bank that was acquired in 1985.andP;  Having SMS madethat conversion easier.andP;  &quot;We were able to do the conversion just by addingsome extra code to our SMS routines,&quot; explained Petrella.andP;  &quot;We were able todo it more efficiently and end up with the data in a managed environment.&quot;andM;Interactive Storage ManagementandM;The most significant enhancement IBM has made in storage management is theset of Automated Class Selection (ACS) routines.andP;  They enable a storageadministrator to identify data by data class, storage class, management classand storage group.andP;  Once the data are classified, the system can thendetermine the most effective management approach.andP;  &quot;Without SMS, someone hasto go in and manually make the decision as to when data is going to be backedup, when it will be sent off site, when it will be taken off primary DASD,&quot;said Parsons.andP;  &quot;Under SMS, that is all predefined.andP;  The storage managementperson never has to look at the data.&quot;andM;The ACS routines in SMS work most efficiently when they are able to identifydata by data set name, rather than by having to look in the job controllanguage of a system.andP;  A JCL is used to communicate with the operating systemof a computer, telling it who a user is, what program the user is invokingand what resources will be needed.andP;  Putting this information in the data setname, which identifies a collection of similar and related data records,makes it unnecessary to rewrite the JCL later on.andP;  However, it makes itnecessary for any organization implementing SMS to adopt strict namingconventions, and stick to them.andM;Bank of Boston began overhauling its approach to data set names in the late1970s when it was converting from one operating system (MVT) to another(MVS).andP;  Initially, the bank set out to name its data sets to reflect what wasactually in the data.andP;  Over time, however, as the bank introduced moreon-line services, the data set names were altered to reflect how the datashould be managed.andP;  &quot;After a while, we really didn't want to know what wasinside them [the data sets],&quot; explains Parsons.andM;Getting everyone to agree on how to standardize names isn't always easy.andP;  Forexample, when the bank decided to add a new qualifier to its names, severalmonths of spirited debate ensued.andP;  &quot;There were no lines drawn,&quot; says Parsons.andO;&quot;It was simply that different people had different ideas about the best wayto do things.&quot;andP;  Ultimately, a compromise was reached: the new qualifier wasmade optional for existing applications but was required for new ones.andM;Parsons and Petrella believe that the data set name is all important and willeventually render the JCL virtually useless.andP;  &quot;We believe the name isstrategic&quot; says Petrella.andP;  Allen of the Gartner Group agrees, suggesting thatIBM's emphasis on naming standards is one of the most critical--andpotentially controversial--aspects of the whole SMS effort.andP;  &quot;One of thefundamental challenges we face in the 1990s is defining data set structuresand standards.andP;  What IBM has done with ACS is give you a higher levellanguage for classifying data and bind you to it, saying 'these are the onlydescriptions you have available.'andP;  The goal of SMS is to have JCL use nothingbut the data set name.&quot;andM;To help build support for the SMS effort, Parsons and Petrella launched afull-scale sales campaign that went on for a full year.andP;  Dog and pony showswere given to programmers and operations staff.andP;  Regular &quot;flashes&quot; were sentout under a logo developed specifically for the SMS program.andP;  And a manual ofSMS operating procedures and standards was created.andP;  A firm rule was alsolaid down: no conversions would take place until end users were sold on theidea.andP;  &quot;We made a decision very early on that what we were selling was thechange, not the technology, recalls Petrella.andM;The Big Internal SellandM;IBM recommends that formal service level agreements be prepared betweenend-user groups and IS stating exactly what IS will delivery in terms ofsystem response and availability.andP;  The agreement then becomes the quid proquo that users receive in return for giving up the control they had overstorage management.andP;  But Bank of Boston has never used these agreements.andP;  &quot;Wesaw it as detrimental to the kind of relationship we are trying to developwith users,&quot; say Petrella, who prefers a less structured approach.andM;The bank sent 12 of its people--one systems programmer and the rest fromoperations--to Washington, D.C., for an IBM seminar on its Data FacilityStorage Management Subsystem (DFSMS), a family of four software products thatcomprise the heart of SMS.andP;  The decision to weight the team heavily on theoperations side was not made lightly.andP;  Bank of Boston's IS department likesto have operations personnel do things that are traditionally reserved forsystem programmers.andP;  &quot;We want our systems programmers working on ways for thebank to provide new services.&quot;andP;  Throughout the SMS effort, the bank had onlyone systems programmer permanently assigned to the project.andM;The bank converted its application development system to SMS last spring.andP;  Itfollowed the same steps it would follow for any migration: running SMS firston the system programmer test system, then the development system andultimately the primary production system.andP;  Simulations of 150transaction-processing users were run, as were batch job streams, to stresstest the new environment.andP;  In total, Petrella estimates, the SMS effort hastaken four man-years.andM;The initial migration took place on April 1, beginning with allsystem-generated temporary data sets and those with a life cycle of one dayor less.andP;  The next weekend, all time-sharing operation (TSO) useridentification data sets and test application data sets were converted.andP;  TheIS staff then took a breather for two weeks to let all of those data burn in.andM;In the final phase of the conversion, IS began moving its own data: thelibraries and system program data sets.andP;  These proved the most difficult toconvert in part because they are dangerous to move: one mistake here, and thebank's entire system could be in jeopardy.andP;  But there was also another factorthat Petrella reluctantly owns up to: IS just doesn't enforce the namingstandards on itself that it does on its end users.andP;  Ultimately, the finalphase of the conversion stretched out until June.andM;While the bank increased its DASD efficiency to 90%, not every IS shop thatuses SMS will necessarily reach that level.andP;  &quot;It depends on the level ofactivity in your data,&quot; says Parsons.andP;  &quot;You could hit 95% if you haverelatively static data that does not change or grow.andP;  But for someone elsewith more active data, it might be much less.&quot;andM;The higher level of DASD use at the Bank of Boston was achieved lessexpensively than it had been before because the bank now needs fewer storageadministrators and because fewer (if any) third-party storage products areneeded.andP;  The organization of the data was also simplified, from 13 data poolsdown to one storage group.andM;Petrella expects to have all of the bank's mainframe storage under SMS bythis spring, but that is only the beginning.andP;  Ultimately, the bank also wantsto manage data that are stored outside the IBM mainframe environment; it iscurrently looking at ways to bring various departmental DEC systems into theSMS fold.andM;Questions, QuestionsandM;Because storage plays such a big role in the bank's IS budget, Parsons isexamining the implications of SMS on the way IS charges its end users insidethe bank.andP;  For example, perhaps user charges should be linked to how data areclassified under SMS.andP;  Users would then be charged more or less based on howmuch storage space is occupied and where it is located, as opposed to by thenumber of input/output transactions.andP;  But what would be the ramification ofthat approach?andP;  What about, for example, the user who selects a storageoption because it is less expensive, but then complains about theperformance?andM;It's questions like these that make Parsons see the SMS implementation as theBank of Boston's biggest IS project since the conversion from Honeywell inthe 1960s.andP;  The impact of SMS will be felt not just in IS but throughout thebank, particularly as it plans additional acquisitions.andP;  &quot;SMS will involveevery user and every data set everywhere in the Bank of Boston,&quot; saysParsons.andP;  &quot;SMS touches everything we do.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
