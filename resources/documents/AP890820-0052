Michael Imfeld, an attorney representing one of the twoconservative clergymen who sponsored the November referendum, saidhe was notified Saturday of Superior Court Judge Ira Brown's rulingthe day before.   The law, which would allow homosexual and other unmarried couplesto register their relationships, was to have taken effect July 6 butwas suspended when the clergymen succeeded in putting the issue onthe Nov. 7 ballot.   The lesbian couple, Cindy Bologna and Sydney Erskine, challengedthe referendum.   ``We did not expect that they'd be able to keep voters fromvoting on it. I was surprised they even tried,'' said Imfeld.   Neither Bologna nor Erskine could be reached immediately forcomment.   Imfeld represents the Rev. Charles McIllhenny of the FirstOrthodox Presbyterian Church. McIllhenny and Rabbi Lionel Feldmanmounted a petition drive to put the law to a vote.</TEXT></DOC>
