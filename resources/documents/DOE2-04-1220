In addition, on May 1, 1987, the DOEissued a final rule that subjects any nonradioactive hazardous componentsin radioactive wastes streams, including high-level and transuranic wastes,to additional regulation under the Resource Conservation and RecoveryAct (RCRA). Many DOE wastes contain RCRA-regulated constituents, suchas halogenated organic solvents, degreasers, and heavy metals. Such wastesare now considered to be mixed waste, and this change gives the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) jurisdiction to impose a great many new requirementson DOE's radioactive waste management operations. All DOE mixed wastestorage and disposal sites must now have RCRA permits and meet RCRA'stechnical requirements. As a result of these changes, DOE has had toformulate an entirely new approach to waste management, which has involvedthe establishment of new philosophies, programs, and procedures. Thispaper describes the new integrated approach for the management of hazardousand mixed wastes at DOE installations. The discussion includes wasteminimization, RCRA-permitted storage, development of treatment and disposaloptions, and technology demonstration.</TEXT></DOC>
