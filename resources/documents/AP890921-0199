In Washington, a top Pentagon official said the American forcesfound ``chaos and near anarchy'' upon arrival in this popular U.S.resort, but the White House later said the situation was improving.   The Marine Radio Band, monitored on nearby St. Thomas, said twolooters had been shot in St. Croix, the largest and most populousisland of the chain. However, there was no word of their conditionor independent confirmation.   The latest forces arriving from the mainland joined 100 U.S.marshals and FBI agents that the U.S. attorney general ordered tothe island.   On Thursday, dozens of marshals with shotguns were posted infront of the downtown federal building, while others patrolled thestreets on foot.   One woman checking her destroyed yacht screamed insults atmarshals when they aimed weapons at her, apparently mistaking herfor a looter.   ``Go after the bloody criminals, not the honest citizens!'' sheshouted.   Territorial Sen. Holland Redfield said that in many cases,supermarkets gave people permission to take the food because it wasspoiling. He said only a few looters were hardcore criminals.   People were reported carrying guns after widespread lootingconvulsed the island, which still lacks water, power and telephoneservice in the wake of Hugo's wrath.   There were new reports Thursday that looting was rampant too onneighboring St. Thomas, the second most populous of the U.S. VirginIslands and also a popular tourist site for Americans.   Hugo damaged virtually every building on St. Croix, an island of53,000 about 70 miles east of Puerto Rico. Authorities reported onedrowning, and hundreds were reported injured and thousands homeless.   Chief Warrant Officer Layton Timmons of the Virgin IslandsNational Guard, who was at the airport watching mainland forcesdisembark, said there were only 900 guardsmen in the U.S. VirginIslands.   He acknowledged that the Coast Guard had videotaped someguardsmen who had taken part in looting.   ``When two people start looting, the whole Guard gets the wrap,''Thomas said. ``Don't condemn the organization. I don't loot.''   By late Thursday, it appeared most unprotected stores had beensacked and there appeared to be little left to loot.   The Coast Guard on Wednesday began evacuating to Puerto Rico allpeople who feared for their safety. A C-146 transport plane with 70aboard, mostly tourists, arrived late Wednesday at old Ramey AirForce Base in Agua Dilla, about 75 miles west of San Juan.   Coast Guard officials expected to bring up to 200 more peoplefrom St. Croix on Thursday.   John Curren, a writer from Washington, D.C., said after steppingoff the plane that mobs had ``established the law of the revolver''by shooting and breaking into stores.   On St. Croix, Lt. Col. Ned Longsworth, spokesman for the 18thAirborne Corps from Fort Bragg, N.C., said his unit's mission is toassist local civilian authorities in restoring order and protectingpublic and private property.   ``We will stay until the mission is accomplished,'' he said.   In Miami, weary residents and tourists who arrived Thursday fromSt. Croix said they armed themselves with makeshift weapons andwatched in horror as looters rampaged through the island.   Drew Simpson of Toronto told of forming a ``dynamic team'' withseveral dozen others who took refuge in a hotel outside ofChristiansted.   He said they used machetes to sharpen flag poles into spears andblocked roads to the hotels with trees and debris because of fearsof potential violence.   ``Once it became dark, you really got spooked,'' he said,describing hearing weapons fire. But he and others said they werenot attacked by looters.   The first contingent of U.S. military personnel landed at 7:40a.m. EDT on the island and moved quickly to establish a mobilecontrol tower and prepare the airfield for the arrival of 1,105military police, said Lt. Cmdr. Ned Lundquist, a Pentagon spokesman.   By late afternoon Thursday, five aircraft carrying a total of 230people and 105 tons of cargo had arrived on St. Croix. Three moreaircraft were en route with 120 people and 40 additional tons ofcargo, Pentagon officials said.   Longsworth said the rest of the soldiers were to arrive laterThursday and Friday. He said most of the units consist of militarypolice.   ``Martial law has not been declared. We are just here to assistlocal authorities. We are authorized to make arrests only in thetotal absence of local authorities,'' Longsworth said.   By late Thursday, the helmeted, heavily armed soldiers, equippedwith flak jackets and backpacks, were still at the airport with onlythe federal marshals deployed downtown.   Harry Brandon, head of the FBI in San Juan, said the FBI agentsand federal marshals will ``help local authorities get back on theirfeet.'' He said the FBI's first priority was to stop the looting.   ``The looting is still going on,'' Brandon said. ``I think thatby the end of the day, things will begin to return to normal.''   In Washington, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,``The troops are having an obvious impact in controlling the lootingand other lawlessness associated with the destruction. It isimpossible to say at this point how long they will have to bethere.''   He said, ``The local officials of course are still in charge oflaw enforcement there.''   Another military spokesman, Fred Hoffman, said the troops hadencountered problems landing on St. Croix because the small airfieldwas crowded and there were no night lights. Planes overturned by thestorm littered the airport.   Two guided missile carriers, the Stephen Groves and the CliftonSprague, have been moved into the area as a precaution, Hoffman said.   The troops, the first active duty military personnel sent ontothe nation's streets in 20 years, were ordered by President BushWednesday night.   Adm. William J. Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,said earlier Thursday the troops had been issued rifles and told toshoot if necessary to defend themselves.   All told, the troops would include 635 military police from FortBragg, N.C., and 470 military police from companies in Fort Polk,La.; Fort Hood, Texas, and Fort Leonard Wood, Mo.   Generally, the National Guard is summoned to restore order incivil disturbances. But presidents are allowed to use federal troopsby declaring an emergency.   The last time federal troops were used to suppress riots was in1968 in Washington, D.C., and other cities after the assassinationof Martin Luther King Jr., administration officials said. PresidentReagan authorized the use of troops in 1987 to handle prison riotsin Atlanta, but they were never deployed.</TEXT></DOC>
