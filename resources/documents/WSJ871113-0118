The offering's terms, which were set by underwriters led by First Boston Corp., provided another indication that investor fear of an imminent recession in the wake of the Oct. 19 stock market crash is abating. The triple-A-rated offering also suggests that such asset-backed fixed-income certificates are becoming a fixture in the U.S. corporate bond market.    &quot;We thought the cost was very attractive,&quot; said Robert E. Baker, vice chairman of Chrysler Financial, which sold the certificates through a trust at a semiannual equivalent yield of 8.79%, or 1.15 percentage points more than similar-maturing Treasury notes. During the past several weeks, top-rated asset-backed securities have been issued at &quot;spreads of between 1.2 and 1.3 percentage points,&quot; said Anthony V. Dub, a managing director and head of the asset finance group at First Boston.    Mr. Dub said that before Black Monday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 508.00 points, triple-A-rated asset-backed securities were being sold at yields as low as 0.75 percentage point above similar-maturing Treasury issues, a benchmark for all borrowing in the credit markets.    &quot;It's a good financing spread for us, given that spreads have widened considerably since the stock market crash,&quot; said Mr. Baker. He added that competition among several underwriters for the chance to arrange the deal was intense, another sign that investor jitters about corporate debt offerings now are diminishing.    &quot;It was a very tough call between First Boston and Salomon Brothers,&quot; which wound up as a co-manager of the Chrysler Financial offering, Mr. Baker said.    As in other asset-backed offerings, Chrysler Financial created a trust consisting of automobile loans that cover the certificates' interest payments to investors. The 91,696 auto loans in the trust averaged about $10,930. The average interest rate on the loans is about 11.7%, and the average remaining term to maturity of the loans is about 56.2 months, according to First Boston.    By repackaging the auto loans and effectively selling them to investors, Chrysler Financial can use proceeds to reduce its debt load and &quot;clear the deck so we can do more business,&quot; said Mr. Baker.    The sale of auto loans and other receivables in the form of bond market offerings has increased in recent years because finance companies can make room for new assets on their balance sheets.    &quot;Our goal is to maintain a 9-to-1&quot; ratio of debt to equity capital at Chrysler Financial, said Mr. Baker. Since the end of last year, Chrysler Financial's total assets have increased to about $25 billion from $21 billion.    A year ago, in the largest-ever corporate sale in the bond market, General Motors Acceptance Corp. sold $4 billion of asset-backed certificates. So far this year, Chrysler Financial has sold more than $2 billion of asset-backed offerings through public and private sales.    In the latest offering, the 8.55% monthly-coupon certificates were priced at 99 17/32 to yield an equivalent of 8.79% semiannually. The certificates have a final maturity of Oct. 15, 1992, but their estimated average life is 1.95 years, on the issuer's assumption that 1.3% of the number of auto loans outstanding will be prepaid. The issue is rated triple-A by both Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., as a result of a letter of credit from Union Bank of Switzerland guaranteeing 7 1/2% of the amount of the loans. </TEXT></DOC>
