The president, who is so vocal about human-rights abuses in the Soviet Union and East-bloc countries, did not care to broach the subject with the Chinese foreign minister during his visit to the White House. Perhaps the president &quot;forgot&quot; about it.    Since last September's and October's pro-independence demonstrations, more than 5,000 Tibetans have been arrested and half of them are women and children. They are being incarcerated, beaten and tortured. Tibetans in Tibet are once again being subjected to psychological agony with frantic &quot;re-education&quot; campaigns in an attempt to bring the Tibetans into submission. The above figure does not include Tibetans who have been arrested since the March 5 pro-independence demonstration in Lhasa. According to Tibetan sources, many monks were killed in the Jokhang temple on March 5 when 2,000 Chinese riot police stormed the temple. The Chinese officials have made it clear that the Tibetan demonstrators will be punished severely.    The head of the most powerful country in the world must not be an accomplice of those who commit human-rights crimes. We must speak up against human-rights violations wherever they occur, not just limiting our condemnations to the Soviet Union and a few other countries. Our commitment to human rights must be clear, consistent and unequivocal. We must not kowtow to Chinese government pressures. China needs the U.S. more than the U.S. needs China. I believe even the Chinese leaders will respect firmness and consistency rather than wishy-washy and feeble policy.    Tinley Nyandak   Editor, News Tibet   New York</TEXT></DOC>
