SIMPSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ciriaco De Mita, who has been caretaker premier sincehis government fell three weeks ago, was chosen Tuesday to form anew government and said he would try to resurrect the samefive-party coalition.   He also said no progress could be made in negotiating Italy's49th government since World War II until after European Parliamentelections Sunday.   Both De Mita's Christian Democrats and their Socialist rivals hadhoped President Francesco Cossiga would delay naming apremier-designate until next week, but opposition parties said thedelay had brought most government work to a standstill.   After meeting with Cossiga, the premier said he would seek toform a government based on an alliance of parties receiving ``theconstant, growing consensus of Italians.''   His reference was to several local elections, the latest inSardinia last weekend, in which Christian Democrats, Socialists andsmaller parties in the coalition posted gains.   De Mita resigned May 19 after Socialist leader Bettino Craxi saidhe could no longer support the governing coalition. He accused DeMita of failing to show leadership. Craxi is a former premier andhas made no secret of wanting the job back.   With nearly all votes counted in the Sardinia election, theChristian Democrats, long Italy's dominant party, had 34.9 percentof the vote, up from 32.2 percent five years ago, and the Socialists13.9 percent, up from 10.1 percent.   The Communists, the No. 2 party and currently in a slump, droppedto 23.1 percent from 28.7 percent in the last election. The rest ofthe vote went to smaller or regional parties.   Political commentators said the results showed voters support thecoalition, which also includes the Social Democratic, Republican andLiberal parties.   They also noted, however, that the trend has not eased therivalry between the Christian Democrats and Socialists.</TEXT></DOC>
