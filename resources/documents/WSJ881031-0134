The agreement, the largest ever made by a law firm to settle allegations of misconduct, was designed to remove Blank Rome as a defendant from continuing suits against former officers and directors of Sunrise Savings andamp; Loan Association, a once high-flying thrift in Boynton Beach, Fla., which has been closed by federal regulators. The suits were brought by the U.S. government and former Sunrise shareholders.    In a ruling late Friday, U.S. District Judge Thomas N. O'Neill Jr. refused to grant an order protecting Blank Rome against future claims arising out of the pending lawsuits involving Sunrise. Attaining that court-ordered protection for the firm was a central condition of the settlement.    &quot;As of right now there is no settlement,&quot; said Donald T. Bucklin, lead outside counsel for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the government agency that sued Sunrise's officers and advisers.    Mr. Bucklin and other lawyers involved in the case said they hadn't yet decided whether the agreement could be renegotiated. &quot;We will reconsider the situation,&quot; said John G. Harkins Jr., Blank Rome's outside attorney.    Judge O'Neill, who is supervising the litigation over Sunrise, didn't say that he opposed the settlement itself or the idea of protecting Blank Rome. Instead, he declined to grant the type of order sought by the settling parties because of its potential effect on defendants in the lawsuits who haven't agreed to settle.    Blank Rome, the FSLIC and the shareholders had requested an order that would have reduced any future liability of other defendants -- such as former Sunrise officers and directors -- by the dollar amount of the law firm's settlement.    But after 20 pages of dense legal analysis, Judge O'Neill concluded that, at least as to claims made under federal laws, the liability of other defendants would have to be reduced on a proportional basis. That would mean, for example, that if a jury in a future trial found that Blank Rome had been 50% responsible for misdeeds involving Sunrise, the liability of the remaining defendants would be reduced by 50%, regardless of how much money that worked out to be.    The impact of the proportional approach would be that the government and shareholders would bear the risk that they had settled in advance for less than Blank Rome's ultimate liability. Judge O'Neill wrote that bearing this risk would encourage the plaintiffs to make sure that their settlement was sufficient.    The FSLIC had accused Blank Rome in a September 1986 suit of negligence in providing advice to Sunrise, aiding thrift officials in making irresponsible loans, and creating conflicts of interest by representing both Sunrise and borrowers in various transactions. Partners of Blank Rome created Sunrise in 1980, solicited its original investors and served on its board. Regulators seized control of Sunrise in July 1985 after determining that the thrift had made bad loans and was insolvent.    Under the proposed settlement, Blank Rome would have made cash payments of about $29 million to the FSLIC and $10 million to a fund to be distributed to shareholders. The firm also would have set aside about $11 million to cover possible claims by outside parties against Blank Rome. Money left over from the fund for outside claims later would have become available to the FSLIC and shareholders. </TEXT></DOC>
