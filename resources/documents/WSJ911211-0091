EdwardKennedy announced in 1988, explaining why the Senate blockedMr. Siegan's nomination to be a federal appeals court judgein California. Mr. Siegan was far out because he urged judgesto protect property rights against overregulatingpoliticians.   Three years later, and Mr. Siegan is helping to write theconstitution for Bulgaria and other former communistcountries, with full guarantees for economic liberties. Whosemainstream, Mr. Kennedy?   The Supreme Court will soon answer this question. Thejustices agreed to hear several appeals from plaintiffs whosay they were denied rights to property and contracts. Incases of Economics Rights vs. Politicians, the justices willkeep in mind the arguments of their would-be colleague -- andMr. Siegan's fate in a property-rights-ignoring Senate.   There's one case the court will decide this term that hasregulators across the country worried that theirhigh-handedness can sometimes be unconstitutional. PFZProperties v. Rodriguez is a reminder that governmentofficials tainted by a political agenda can turn valuableprivate property into wasteland.   The case began in 1976 when the Puerto Rico Planning Boardapproved the plan by PFZ, a local developer, to build a largehotel and condominium development on land it owned in theisland's Vacia Talega area. There was the usual litigation,but by the following year the courts approved construction.All that remained was for the Regulation and PermitsAuthority to approve the specific blueprints, which issupposed to be a routine procedure.   Instead, a decade passed as the agency sat on theapplication. In court papers, PFZ described learning that in1987 a commonwealth official ordered an aide to remove one ofthe key documents &quot;from the project file and give it to hissecretary to conceal in a locked file cabinet.&quot;   The development was apparently snagged by Puerto Ricanpolitics. Indeed, an aide to Governor Rafael Hernandez Colonallegedly admitted as much to the president of PFZ. At ameeting on the project in 1987, according to PFZ, the aidesaid the project was &quot;in trouble&quot; for political reasons,including pressure from environmentalists. There had been aproposal to expropriate the land, and factions in thegovernor's own party opposed the development. As a legalmatter, however, the project had long ago been approved.   Lawyers for PFZ thought there should be a law againstregulators violating Puerto Rico's own rules for howdevelopment applications should be processed. This is aclassic case where there is an apparent violation of aneconomic right that is not covered by either the TakingsClause or Contracts Clause, the Constitution's more preciseprotections for economic rights (discussed in earliercolumns).   Instead, lawyers here cited the 14th Amendment prohibitionagainst depriving anyone of &quot;life, liberty or propertywithout due process of law&quot; in a bid to have courts declarethat Puerto Rico unconstitutionally deprived PFZ of itsbuilding permit.   The case was dismissed by the federal trial court and bythe federal appeals court. The judges agreed that the allegedbehavior by the bureaucrats was outrageous, but also said toobad. The appeals court ruled that even if regulators &quot;engagedin delaying tactics and refused to issue permits for theproject based on considerations outside the scope of itsjurisdiction under Puerto Rican law, such practices, withoutmore, do not rise to the level of violations of the federalConstitution under a substantive due process label.&quot;   The reason for this judicial indifference is that PFZ&quot;only&quot; complained about an economic loss. The Due ProcessClause is routinely used in everything from child-custodybattles to prisoner-rights cases, but for the past 50 yearsthe courts have relegated economic rights to second-classtreatment. Perhaps until now. PFZ asked the Supreme Court toconsider its case as a violation of both procedural andsubstantive due process. The justices said they would heararguments only about substantive due process.   This is fascinating because it means the justices coulduse this case to remove the stake from the heart of a legaldoctrine liberals thought FDR killed in the New Deal bythreatening to pack the court. He insisted that judges nolonger cite &quot;substantive due process&quot; to invalidateregulations that interfered with free markets.   The approach was symbolized by a 1905 case, Lochner v. NewYork. This Supreme Court decision invalidated the state limiton the number of work hours at bakeries. This case is rarelymentioned these days in what passes for polite society amonglawyers or in law schools.   Indeed, Lochner is best remembered for a dissent by OliverWendell Holmes, who wrote, &quot;The 14th Amendment does not enactMr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statics.&quot; True, but JusticeHolmes was guilty at least of overstatement when he added, &quot;AConstitution is not intended to embody a particular economictheory.&quot; Our Constitution planned an economy of protectedprivate property and enforced contracts.   The most intriguing line in the majority opinion inLochner hints at the real reason for many economicregulations -- and the possible explanation for PFZ'snightmare. Justice Rufus Peckham wrote that judges must not&quot;shut our eyes to the fact that many of the laws of thischaracter, while passed under what is claimed to be thepolice power for the purpose of protecting the public healthor welfare, are, in reality, passed from other motives.&quot;   There is good evidence that the bakery law, for example,was the result of lobbying by large bakeries, which fearedcompetition from smaller bakeries -- many of which were ownedby immigrant families happy to work long hours. JusticePeckham knew that unless judges protect victims'constitutional rights, politicians will inevitably do favorsfor special interests.   Mr. Siegan, now a University of San Diego law professor,wrote in his 1980 book &quot;Economic Liberties and theConstitution&quot; that this case doesn't deserve its poorreputation. &quot;The reaction to Lochner,&quot; he said, &quot;might havebeen less harsh if the critics recognized that the lawprobably would have reduced considerably the wages of manylow-paid workers, and caused others to lose their jobs.&quot;   The Supreme Court does not need to fully revive Lochner,with its potential for judges going too far insecond-guessing legislators, to rule in favor of PFZ. All thejustices need to do is prohibit government arbitrariness,even if the &quot;only&quot; right at stake is economic.   The Constitution's system of government and laws protectedprivate property, helping to build the most prosperous nationon earth. Judges have largely ignored these rights for thepast half-century. Now that the rest of the world hopes tomimic our success by defending economic civil rights, we alsoneed to rediscover this wisdom of our Founders.</TEXT></DOC>
