Average energy Wp to produce onescintillation photon for various scintillators and energy transfer processesof electrons and holes to Tl/sup +/ in NaI crystals are described. Scintillationmechanism for CsF is explained in terms of non-Auger radiative transitionsof electrons from (2p)/sup 6/F-valence band to (5p)/sup 5/Cs/sup ++/holes, which are produced by incident charged particles. Radiation effectson scintillators are briefly described.</TEXT></DOC>
