(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Home-Brewed @FunctionsandM;How often have you wished for an @function to replace proprietarycalculations--calculations you currently perform by using complex formulas orslow, looping macros?andM;There was a time when you needed the Lotus Developer Tools and a knowledge ofthe complex assembly programming language to create @functions.andP;  Now twoadd-in programs, 3-2-1 Gosub and @Tools, offer more-facile programmingmethods to create @functions for 1-2-3 Release 2, 2.01, and 2.2.andM;3-2-1 Gosub generates an @function from a range of formulas in a worksheet.andO;The program comes in two versions.andP;  With the Developer Edition ($249.95), youcan create @functions that can be used in any 1-2-3 Release 2.x worksheet,even without 3-2-1 Gosub attached.andP;  In contrast, @functions you create withthe Standard Edition ($99.95) can be used only with 3-2-1 Gosub attached andonly in a worksheet that contains the formulas used to develop those@functions.andM;@Tools ($299.95) lets you create add-in @functions by using the C programminglanguage.andP;  @Functions created with @Tools not only simplify 1-2-3 worksheetapplications but also add-new functionality to 1-2-3.andP;  However, @Toolsrequires more patience and perhaps more expertise than 3-2-1 Gosub.andP;  @Tools'manual is incomplete, and the publisher provides no telephone technicalsupport for the product.andP;  Neither 3-2-1 Gosub nor @Tools can create@functions for 1-2-3 Release 3.andP;  For that, you need the Lotus Add-In Toolkitfor Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3 ($395), which will be reviewed in the August issue.andM;3-2-1 GosubandM;In 1-2-3 you create formulas that reference cells in your worksheet.andP;  Using3-2-1 Gosub, you create formulas that reference the arguments entered intoyour @function.andM;For example, suppose you work for an engineering firm and regularly calculatethe volumes of various cylindrical tanks.andP;  In 1-2-3 you could create thefollowing formula:andM;3.14*(A1[caret]2)*B1andM;In the formula, the value in cell A1 is the cylinder's radius, and the valuein cell B1 is the cylinder's height.andM;When using 3-2-1 Gosub, first name the range that contains a formula, givingit the same name as the @function to be created--in this case, cylvol.andP;  Next,use 3-2-1 Gosub's special @functions to reference your variables as argumentsrather than cell addresses.andP;  The contents of the resulting range, cylvol,look like this:andM;@RETURN(3.14*(@ARG(1) [caret]2)*@ARG(2))andM;Now enter the formula @CYLVOL (radius, height) anywhere within thisworksheet.andM;@CYLVOL is an example of the simplest type of @function you can create with3-2-1 Gosub.andP;  The program also makes it easy to create @functions thatperform repeating calculations.andP;  For example, suppose you need to calculateinterest compounded daily.andP;  Without 3-2-1 Gosub, you have to create 365 rowsof copied interest formulas or a looping macro that repeatedly calculates oneday's interest, adds that interest to the principal to get a new principalamount, and then calculates the next day's interest based on that new amount.andO;By using special @functions in 3-2-1 Gosub, you can create an @function thatwill pass each new principal amount back into your interest formula as manytimes as you specify.andM;You can also program your @functions to handle errors.andP;  To build on theexample above, you can specify that the daily interest rate must be positive.andO;If someone enters a negative interest rate as an argument, the @function willreturn ERR.andP;  You can also specify that any argument must be a value or alabel.andP;  If someone tries to enter the wrong type of argument in your@function, the @function won't accept that argument.andM;Writing formulas in 3-2-1 Gosub isn't exactly like writing formulas in 1-2-3.andO;A few special rules apply.andP;  Every range that you specify within your formulasmust contain at least two cells, even if only one cell in that range containsdata.andP;  Also, if a formula enters information in any cell, you have toinitialize that cell by entering the same type of information--value orlabel--in that cell before you even use the @function.andP;  These rules can slowyou down at first.andP;  Sometimes when you edit formulas, you must remember toreadjust your range references and reinitialize your ranges.andM;As mentioned, the Developer Edition of 3-2-1 Gosub compiles your formulasinto add-in @functions.andP;  In general, these @functions run faster than theworksheet-based @functions you create with the Standard Edition.andP;  I testedtwo worksheets, each containing 10 daily interest @functions described above.andO;I used the Standard Edition to create the @functions in one worksheet and theDeveloper Edition to create them in the other.andP;  The Standard Edition's@functions took 15 seconds to recalculate; the Developer Edition's @functionstook 5 seconds.andM;@ToolsandM;If you're a competent C programmer, you can easily create @functions with@Tools--once you overcome obstacles presented by the program's incomplete andsometimes inaccurate documentation.andM;@Tools' manual states that the program works with two popular C-languagecompilers: Microsoft C Optimizing Compiler, version 4 and 5.0 ($450 each),and Borland International's Turbo C Professional ($250).andP;  In truth, @Toolsworks only with the Microsoft C compilers.andP;  I found this out the hard way--bytrying to use the program with Turbo C.andP;  @Tools' program disk has a READ.MEfile that corrects this mistake in the manual, but that file is easy tooverlook.andM;Even if you find the READ.ME file, you're still not out of the woods.andP;  @Toolsrequires that you use Microsoft C version 4's alternate floating-point mathlibrary or version 5.0's calling interface.andP;  However, the @Tools manualdoesn't clearly state this requirement.andP;  If you installed Microsoft Caccording to its default settings, you won't have this alternate library orcalling interface and you'll have to reinstate Microsoft C to make @Toolswork.andP;  According to the publisher, a marketing brochure now included with@Tools clears up some of this confusion; I didn't receive a copy of thisbrochure in time to include it in the review.andM;These problems, and any others you encounter, are aggravated by the program'slack of telephone support.andP;  The publisher asks that you transmit anyquestions about the program via fax and promises a response by phone or byfax within a few days.andP;  In other words, if you need help in a hurry, you'reout of luck.andM;But once you get past these obstacles, @Tools is as easy to use as any otherC library.andP;  Your first step is to reference @Tools' INCLUDE file in theprogramming code for your @functions.andP;  Then use the program's batch files tocompile that code automatically, link the resulting object file to @Tools'library file, and convert your linked file into a 1-2-3 add-in, which you canthen attach to 1-2-3.andM;Writing a 1-2-3 @function in @Tools seems like a natural extension ofprogramming in C.andP;  Numeric values used in 1-2-3--be they arguments entered inyour @function or values returned by your @function--are defined as standardC types; strings are defined as standard C strings.andM;Beyond CalculationsandM;@Tools has two advantages over 3-2-1 Gosub.andP;  First, it lets you manipulatecertain 1-2-3 settings in the background.andP;  For example, you can create an@function that automatically adjusts the width of a column to fit whateverresult the @function returns.andM;Second, because @Tools lets you create @functions that link 1-2-3 to anyC-language program, your @functions can directly address any applicationwritten in C or any hardware device whose driver is written in C.andP;  You cancreate an @function that queries a database program, such as Borland'sParadox, or an SQL database program, such as Oracle.andP;  Or you can create an@function that takes data from an information-collection device, such as anoptical character-recognition (OCR) scanner, and inserts that data into yourworksheet.andM;These are only a few examples of what is possible.andP;  Unfortunately, the manualdoesn't thoroughly document @Tools' full functionality.andP;  For example, themanual suggests that you can use @Tools to reallocate to other programs thememory normally used by 1-2-3.andP;  An adventurous programmer might use thiscapability, say, to create an @function that automatically passes data to anactive terminate-and-stay-resident program, such as Sidekick.andP;  But changing1-2-3's memory allocation can have serious consequences--for example, it canhang up your system or corrupt your worksheet file.andP;  @Tools' manual neithermentions these consequences nor helps you avoid them.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
