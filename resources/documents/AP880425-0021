Up to now, most experts have assumed that agricultural runoffand sewage were the major culprits responsible for the increasingnumber of mass killings of marine life along the Northeast coast,the newspaper said.   But a new report prepared by scientists of the EnvironmentalDefense Fund, a nonprofit environmental group, shows for the firsttime that acid rain is also contributing to the problem, accordingto the newspaper.   Acid rain comes from nitrogen oxides in emissions fromautomobiles, power plants and other industries. The oxides areconverted into nitric acids and nitrates in the atmosphere.   Nitrate salts and other nutrients encourage the growth of algae,which in turn use up oxygen needed by other plants and animalsliving in the coastal waters, according to the report.   ``It is choking off the ocean's nurseries,'' said Dr. MichaelOppenheimer, an atmospheric physicist for the environmental groupand a co-author of the report. ``It is shutting down the playgroundfor millions of Americans.'   ``It is a regionwide problem, and it is only going to get worsebecause of the projected growth of nitrogen emissions,'' he added.   The study focuses on Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries andfound that atmospheric sources account for 25 percent of thenitrogen pouring into the bay each year.   Fertilizers account for 34 percent, sewage and other industrialdischarges 23 percent, and animal wastes, including runoff fromland and evaporated ammonium from manure that travels through theatmosphere, 18 percent.   If current trends continue, atmospheric nitrates will constitute42 percent of annual nitrogen deposits into the bay by the year2030, according to the report.   The conclusion of the report was endorsed by other scientistswho have read drafts of it, including Joel S. O'Connor, anecologist with the Waste Management Institute of the StateUniversity of New York at Stony Brook, according to the Times.   George Hidy, director of the environment division of theElectric Power Institute _ a research association of utilitycompanies that emit large amounts of sulfur and nitrogen from theirplants _ called the report's findings ``an interesting andsurprising hypothesis that needs to be verified.''</TEXT></DOC>
