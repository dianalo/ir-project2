After accidents contaminating Times Beach, Mo., and the Love Canal neighborhood in Niagara, N.Y., grabbed headlines, intense public concern prompted years of strict regulation. But now, two federal agencies that set safety standards for the toxic substance are considering easing their rules, sparking a re-evaluation of how the government regulates the amount of dioxin that can enter the air, water and soil safely.    Chemical companies, hounded by lawsuits and costly cleanups, welcome the prospect of relaxed controls on dioxin, a by-product of chemical processes like pesticide making and paper bleaching. But many environmentalists and other scientists fear that too much remains unknown about dioxin's effects on human health to loosen standards now.    At the Environmental Protection Agency, a staff report last month argued that dioxin isn't as potent as previously believed and suggested that the risk factor for it be reduced by a factor of 16. Perhaps more importantly, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta also is considering downgrading its assessment of dioxin risk, by a factor of 20. The EPA has used the center's current standard of one part per billion as a guideline in supervising soil cleanups; if it were to adopt the centers' contemplated standard of 20 parts per billion, many sites could be cleaned up at lower cost -- or might not have to be cleaned up at all.    Any changes also could affect the paper and incinerator industries, which have been battling the EPA on proposed dioxin-related rules. In addition, there's a good chance that new standards could affect dioxin liability suits.    &quot;Going up 20 times would have a very significant effect&quot; on cleanups and litigation, says Dr. Vernon Houk, director of the Center for Environmental Health at the Centers for Disease Control.    Controversy over the proposed changes centers on research that shows dioxin may be less harmful than earlier believed. Michael Gough, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, a Washington, D.C.-based environmental research group, says that while dioxin in heavy doses has caused acute illness, such as the skin condition chloracne, so far it hasn't been linked directly to any deaths.    Dr. Houk and EPA officials say recent research has established three different stages of cancer: initiation, promotion and progression. Some scientists have concluded that dioxin is a promoter by painting it on the skin of mice and watching to see which developed cancer. Only those already exposed to initiators, like radiation, developed tumors.    If dioxin is merely a promoter, it would join a ubiquitous group of substances like cigarette smoke, asbestos, and certain hormones and foods. Promoters must be present in a relatively high concentration in order to stimulate initiators. Many scientists believe they can pinpoint that &quot;threshold&quot; level for each substance. In addition, they suspect that promoters are probably &quot;reversible.&quot; This means that, unlike initiators which change the genetic makeup of a cell forever, promoters appear to fade away over time, without necessarily leaving any lasting impact.    Henry Pitot, a cancer specialist at the University of Wisconsin, says that much of the new research on dioxin, like its role as a promoter, has recently been substantiated, and that it's time to re-evaluate regulations. &quot;As we learn more about cancer and how it develops, we should take advantage of knowledge rather than sit in the dark,&quot; he says.    The EPA position &quot;isn't the disaster picture you're getting from some people,&quot; says Dr. Houk of the Centers for Disease Control. &quot;It's a very rational decision.&quot;    Others, however, aren't convinced that dioxin is merely a promoter. Nor do they think standards for promoters and initiators should differ. Bernard Weinstein, director of the Cancer Center at Columbia University's School of Public Health, says dioxin alone has been shown in some experiments to induce cancerous tumors.    &quot;I know of no new scientific data or reason for the EPA to change its guidelines,&quot; Dr. Weinstein says.    Wisconsin's Dr. Pitot concedes that while dioxin may be reversible, the substance &quot;hangs around a long time,&quot; taking seven to 10 years to disappear from body tissue. In that respect, it should still be carefully regulated, he says.    Environmentalist Barry Commoner, director of the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College in New York, calls the EPA proposal &quot;ludicrously bad science.&quot; A reviewer of the report for the EPA, he says he doubts enough is known about cancer to change standards.    Ellen Silbergeld, chairwoman of the toxic-chemicals program for the Environmental Defense Fund, also reviewed the report for the EPA. &quot;The simplest definition is the best,&quot; she says. &quot;If a chemical given to an animal causes cancer, then it's a carcinogen.&quot;    The controversy was evident during a speech Mr. Commoner was invited to give recently at the EPA's Washington headquarters. He attacked the agency and the dioxin report at length -- and drew warm applause from many staffers. In addition, all the members of a peer-review committee asked by the agency to comment on the report have criticized its methods, although some endorsed the conclusions.    The report came at the request of EPA Administrator Lee Thomas in an effort to keep regulations current, agency officials say. In addition, many companies have urged a relaxation of cleanup standards for economic reasons.    Syntex Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif., pharmaceutical concern, faces $15 billion in liability suits stemming from dioxin contamination in Missouri, including Times Beach. The company denies liability but also claims dioxin isn't as dangerous as the EPA has maintained.    Syntex scientists estimated in a research paper published in 1986 that the cost of cleaning up dioxin sprayed on the roadsides of Castlewood, Mo., would drop to $6 million from $17 million if the Centers for Disease Control's standard were eased to 10 parts per billion from one part per billion. The company declines to speculate on the cost reduction at 20 parts per billion, the level the center is considering.    Dow Chemical Co. and Hercules Inc. also could benefit from eased standards; both face cleanups around plants that made the defoliant Agent Orange.    In some cases, the changes might be most significant from a public-relations standpoint. David Snively, a lawyer for Monsanto Inc., says any changes may come too late for an appeal of a $16.3 million verdict against the company for a spill in Sturgeon, Mo. But he says new standards could help in several related suits.    &quot;This could diminish jurors' unreasonable expectations&quot; about dioxin's toxicity, Mr. Snively says. He says any changes would help &quot;put a more realistic picture on the problem.&quot;    Others, however, think it will be a long time before public sentiment about dioxin changes. &quot;Scientists are used to changing their minds and admitting their mistakes, but the public isn't,&quot; says Mr. Gough of Resources for the Future. &quot;People won't believe them, because dioxin has such notoriety, and people are terrified of it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
