Norwegian authorities said France's decision guarantees the development of both the Troll and Sleipner natural-gas fields in the North Sea, as well as a 682-mile pipeline from the fields to Belgium. Norway had planned to put the Sleipner and pipeline projects on hold without French participation.    The French government authorized the state natural-gas concern Gaz de France to purchase only six billion cubic meters of gas annually, instead of the original eight billion cubic meters. But Gaz de France also obtained an option to raise annual purchases by an additional two billion cubic meters by the year 2000.    The original accord, concluded in June, called for Norway to sell 450 billion cubic meters of gas between 1993 and 2020 to distributors in France, West Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. The contract was valued at $64 billion, assuming an oil price of $28 a barrel. Gas prices are tied to oil prices.    Norwegian officials said they anticipate that oil companies in the two gas fields' ownership groups will revise development plans to reflect lower French purchases before a meeting of Norway's cabinet tomorrow; the cabinet plans to submit legislation to the parliament Friday that outlines the gas sale.    Originally, the oil companies had expected to pay about $8 billion to develop the fields and build the pipeline.    France had demanded trade concessions and increased imports of French goods by Norway as a condition for approving the gas pact. But Norway's petroleum minister, Arne Oeien, said Norway hasn't granted France any concessions that it couldn't also extend to the three other gas-buying countries. Norway made general commitments to promote greater industrial cooperation with France, he said.    Mr. Oeien did say that French oil companies could expect generous consideration in future awards of offshore oil leases, and that more French concerns will be invited to tender bids for parts of the Troll, Sleipner and pipeline projects. But he added the contracts will be awarded strictly through competitive bidding. </TEXT></DOC>
