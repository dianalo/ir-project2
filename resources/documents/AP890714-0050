The government's Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Predictionsaid an eruption is ``highly likely to recur,'' not only at the samespot but possibly other locations. It said it was broadcastingemergency warnings and news on significant developments to localfamilies.   Most of the 200 residents in Ito who had left their seasidehouses about 60 miles southwest of Tokyo to spend the night inBuddhist temples and schools returned home today, but 43 schoolsclosed amid the uncertainty, said Masaaki Mitsuhashi, a spokesmanfor the resort city of 72,000 people.   ``Although there is no immediate danger, we have eight placesready for evacuees just in case anything worse happens,'' he added.   No injuries or damage have been reported from Thursday night'seruption, but 21 people suffered minor injuries Sunday when twoearthquakes measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale hit the area.   Since June 30, about 22,300 quakes, including 480 large enough tobe felt by humans, have been recorded off Ito and parts of nearbyIzu Peninsula.   The Central Meteorological Agency said new volcanic tremors weremeasured at 2:47 a.m. today, lasting about 87 minutes, and at 11:42a.m., lasting about three minutes.   The volcano erupted about 330 feet undersea at about 6:30 p.m.Thursday, about 8,000 feet northeast of Teishijima, an uninhabitedislet, the agency said.   While water rose about 100 feet in the air, no dangerous waveshit the shore.   Maritime Safety Agency officials passing nearby on a patrol boattold Kyodo News Service today they were ``extremely scared'' whenthey heard a noise that sounded as though a huge hammer had hit thebottom of the vessel, and something was pushing the boat from below.   ``We still have not confirmed whether the eruption formed a newvolcanic mountain under the ocean, but a new piece of ground mightappear out of the ocean,'' said a Central Meteorological official.   This morning, scores of dead fish and stones of volcanic originwere found scattered on the Ito shore, Mitsuhashi said.   Chief Cabinet Secretary Masajuro Shiokawa and National LandAgency Director Eiji Nonaka called today for measures to protectlocal residents.   Daisuke Shimozuru, chairman of the earthquake predictioncommittee, told a news conference Thursday night that recent quakesin the area probably have been caused by magma, or molten rock,under the ocean floor.   Large magma movements can cause earthquakes, which often precedevolcanic eruptions.   The Japanese archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, isbelieved to have about 80 active volcanoes. In January, MountTokachi, on Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido, erupted severaltimes.</TEXT></DOC>
