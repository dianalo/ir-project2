The designation of a field of specialization, selection of a graduateschool, and choice of first employing organization are decisions made duringperiods targeted by current Division activities_periods when a modest amountof individual support can stimulate the development of careers that willstrengthen the academic base and economic competitiveness of the UnitedStates.One of the first decisions for young men and women is the choice of a career.For many of them the commitment to a career in the science, mathematicsor engineering occurs during their secondary school years. In order toassist students in reaching an informed decision the National Science Foundationinitiated in Fiscal Year 1988 the NSF Young Scholars Program, and announcedthe first awards in March, 1988. The National Science Foundation supported68 projects which will provide enrichment experiences in science, mathematicsand engineering for more than 2,500 high ability or high potential secondaryschool students each year. These awards were for one year with a secondyear of support contingent on NSF review of project activities and theavailability of funds. We expect similar results in the 1989 competition.The underrepresentation of women, minorities and the disabled at the advancedlevels of science, mathematics and engineering deprives the Nation of muchpotential talent. Consequently the Foundation strongly encourages the fullparticipation in this program by proposers and students from these groups.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope</ITAG>Young Scholars projects should be designed to enhance participant knowledgeof and exposure to science, mathematics and/or engineering as careers inorder to facilitate their making realistic decisions based on the fullrange of career options available. Specifically, projects should provideparticipants with enrichment experiences in science and related fieldswhich are not usually available to young students. Proposed activitiesshould: (1) Enhance participant interest in science disciplines as possiblecareer choices, (2) enable students to assess their potential skills andabilities in scientific disciplines, (3) increase their awareness of theacademic preparation necessary for such careers, and (4) enhance theirunderstanding of the career planning process and promote their confidencein career selection decisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Eligibility</ITAG>There are three categories of eligibility for the Young Scholars program:submitting organization, activities and discipline focus. Proposals mustmeet the requirements in <T3>all three categories</T3> as outlined below to be eligible for considerationfor funding.Submitting OrganizationProposals may be submitted by colleges or universities, their associationsor consortiums, scientific or professional societies whose members areprimarily university faculty or researchers, and for-profit industriesor other organizations which are engaged in significant advanced researchefforts and have experience in interacting with students. Academic institutionsare encouraged to combine efforts with industries with appropriate researchfacilities.Secondary schools and school districts and other organizations with programsfocused on secondary level education are not eligible to apply as submittingorganizations.Of course, any organization is welcome to collaborate in a project proposaldeveloped and submitted by an eligible institution.ActivitiesRequired and eligible activities are discussed under Project Design. Tutorialor advanced placement courses are not eligible for support under theseguidelines. Nor are activities which substantially duplicate secondarylevel education activities.Discipline FocusThe <T3>Grants for Research and Education in Science and Engineering</T3> (NSF83-57, rev. 11/87, p.1), specifies the fields of science and engineeringwhich are eligible for support. Consistent with these guidelines, the YoungScholars program will not support activities focused on clinical or healthscience disciplines.Any questions regarding a proposed project's eligibility under these categoriesshould be referred to the program staff. Proposers may be asked to submitadditional information regarding organizational or project characteristics.In some cases it may be necessary for NSF staff to review a formal proposalbefore a final and fair determination of eligibility can be made.<ITAG tagnum="84">Project Design</ITAG>Except where otherwise indicated, the Foundation intends to allow projectdirectors maximum flexibility in designing their projects to address specificdiscipline areas and target groups. Particular attention should be paidto the following areas in the proposal:EnvironmentThe project should create a learning environment which challenges the students'intellectual abilities and encourages the development of the requisiteskills for the use of these abilities. The environment also should fosterclose interaction among the participants and between the participants andscience, mathematics, and engineering practitioners, including the projectdirector and staff. The opportunities for interaction should be both formaland informal and the identification of mentors is strongly encouraged.ActivitiesProposers should keep in mind that students learn science best by <T3>practicing science;</T3> that is, by exercising their natural curiosityand engaging in scientific discovery. Projects may consist of any combinationof activities involving instruction, problem solving, and exposure to theresearch environment and research methods that are appropriate for thetargeted age group and the discipline focus. However, proposers shouldstrive for balance between lecture, laboratory and field experiences. Activitiesshould be strongly participatory, be intellectually challenging, and promotepositive interaction among students and staff.The Young Scholars program actively seeks innovative approaches to cost-effectiveenrichment activities for young students in all aspects. These includeoff-campus sites where scientific inquiry is especially intense, unusualdesigns for instruction and demonstration, and creative techniques foracademic-year follow-up.Young Scholars project activities are not intented to duplicate or replacethe secondary school curriculum or offer tutorial services. Nor shouldthe project provide course work primarily designed to prepare studentsfor advanced placement, or to duplicate regular college courses. Further,college credit for the successful completion of project activities is neitherrequired nor encouraged. Exceptions may be made when the institution involvedrequires that credit be given. However, grant funds cannot be used to payper credit fees.<T3>Required Activities</T3>_The following components must be includedin all proposed projects:<T3>Career Exploration_</T3>Since a major objective of this program isto heighten student awareness of science, mathematics and engineering aspossible careers, each project must include career exploration activitieswhich offer information and guidance regarding the opportunities of scienceas a profession, particularly in the discipline area of the project. Theseactivities also should include attention to precollege science teachingas a career choice. Specific attention should be given to the secondaryschool and college academic requirements for a science degree in the selecteddiscipline. The participation of female, minority and disabled scientistsin this activity is especially encouraged.<T3>Philosophy and Ethics of Science_</T3>The development of a mature andparticipating citizen, scientist or not, requires an appreciation of therole of science in society. Therefore, all projects must include some activitythat focuses on the philosophy of science and scientific ethics <T3>specific to the discipline focus of the project.</T3> Examples of appropriatetopics might be guidelines for the collection and use of scientific data,research ethics or the need for a ``Hippocratic oath'' for scientists.<T3>Research Methodology_</T3>The specific methods and techniques of scientificresearch differ by field, but the scientific method serves as the basisfor the discovery of knowledge across disciplines. Projects should includea general discussion of research methodology, with specific attention tothe techniques and methods utilized in the disciplines which serve as thefocus of the project. Hands-on activities in the laboratory and field couldbe included where appropriate along with interaction with scientists.<T3>Follow-up Activities_</T3>An academic-year follow-up for summer programsto sustain the intensity of the experience is also required. Proposed activitiesshould reinforce and expand the knowledge and skills learned during thesummer by helping students utilize these skills in classroom activities.To this end, the follow-up academic-year component need not be limitedto summer participants, but may also involve their classmates and teachers.A summer follow-up component may be proposed for academic-year programs.<T3>Project Outcomes_</T3>Proposers must specify project goals and objectivesand how they plan to measure the success of the project. Established programsshould include a discussion of previous program outcomes. There will beadditional data collection requirement specified by the NSF as part ofits overall assessment of the Young Scholars program.SettingResidential or commuter projects during the summer are recommended as theprincipal mechanism for creating an enrichment experience. Project durationcan vary from 2-8 weeks. However, projects offering an after school/weekendacademic-year program as the principal mechanism are also eligible forfunding.Participants<T3>Junior/Senior High Focus_</T3>Proposers are expected to design programswhich target students entering grades 8-12. Skill development and skillapplication, including hands-on activities and exposure to research methodsand techniques, are required for all students, regardless of grade level.(Established programs seeking support to augment program activities orexpand participant groups are also eligible if the <T3>majority</T3> of current participants are within this grade range.)Participants should be students of high ability or high potential, withinterest in science, mathematics or engineering. The Foundation leavesthe interpretation of high ability and high potential to the proposer,but encourages consideration of students previously identified as underachieversas well as those with limited prior opportunities to explore science asa career. Particular attention should be given to including women, minoritiesand disabled students. The number of project participants will depend on the proposed activitiesand staff but should allow for substantial one-on-one or small group interactionamong students and between students and senior staff. Participant Selection Proposals must specify how participants will be identified, recruited andselected. Admission decisions regarding participants should be made onthe basis of materials submitted by applicants. This information mightinclude (a) recommendations from current or recent science or mathematicsteachers and counselors, (b) a short essay by the student on why he orshe would like to participate or some other appropriate topic and (c) selectedbackground and biographical information. Other mechanisms such as examinationsand interviews can also be considered. The Foundation expects broad-based participation in these programs. Forthis reason participants should be selected from a variety of secondaryschools and excessive representation from any one school is discouraged.In addition, geographic distribution of participants is also an importantfactor for consideration. Projects should be designed, where possible,to attract student participants on a regional or national basis, ratherthan only locally. Participant Costs Lack of personal or family financial resources should not be a barrierto participation by any eligible student. Therefore proposers may requestNSF funding for all or a portion of student expenses, including room andboard for residential projects, travel and a small stipend (not to exceed$100/week) for students whose participation will preclude needed employmentincome. However, proposers can require payment for room and board fromparticipants whom they determine are able to assume responsibility forthese expenses.The narrative should detail per student costs for room and board if applicable,travel and any stipends proposed, as well as the percentage of any or allof these costs NSF is being asked to assume. Proposers who plan to chargeroom and board fees that will vary among NSF-supported participants shouldoutline how applicant financial need will be determined. Ability to paymay be assessed on an individual or group basis. <T3>Stipends for participants must be justified in terms of their use inattracting the target population. Further, the age of participants in termsof earning potential should be taken into consideration in requesting stipends.</T3>Staff Project staffing requirements will depend on the design of the projectand the target population. Senior staff, defined as those who will haveprimary responsibility for the selection of participants, the supervisionof intellectual activity and the demonstration of research techniques andfield instruction, should be academic faculty or active research scientists,mathematicians and engineers in industry. We also encourage the participationas support staff of precollege science and mathematics teachers, counselors,undergraduate and graduate students, and in projects involving junior highschool students, older precollege students. The selection of women, minorityand disabled scientists is encouraged. Staffing levels should be adequateto allow for substantive one-on-one interaction between participants andsenior staff. Proposers are encouraged to solicit volunteers and to utilizepart-time as well as full-time staff in order to reduce costs. Skill inteaching and the ability to interact with young students should be a prerequisitefor the selection of all staff. Sites Since a major objective of this program is to acquaint students with theenvironment and resources of universities, colleges and research organizations,projects should be located at facilities where higher education or advancedresearch takes place. Established Programs The Foundation is aware that a number of activities similar to Young ScholarsProjects, sometimes known at Secondary School Student Science TrainingProjects (SST), have been offered at various campuses in recent years,and have reached funding stability. The Foundation strongly encouragesthe continuation of such programs, and will not normally award supportfor such projects where NSF support would serve mainly to replace establishedfunding. The Foundation, however, does invite proposals from institutionsthat organized such activities in the summer of 1988 or regularly in thelast few years, where NSF support would serve to strengthen such projects,by funding new key components, or to expand such projects, by funding theparticipation of individuals previously unreachable. Twenty-seven suchprojects were supported in 1988. Established projects for which supplementary support is proposed must intheir entirety be eligible for Young Scholar support, and thus must includeall the required Young Scholar components, and must be described fullyin the proposal. <ITAG tagnum="84">Program Assessment Activities </ITAG>The Foundation has established a plan to facilitate early and regular assessmentof program impact. This includes data collection instruments for projectapplicants, participants, staffing and operations. As a part of these activitiesNSF will provide guidance on the format and content of participant applicationmaterials at the time of the award. The cooperation of project directorswill be an important factor in assuring the success of this effort. <ITAG tagnum="84">Budget</ITAG>Proposers may request from the Foundation appropriate direct, indirectand participant costs. Separate budgets should be prepared for year oneand year two of project activities. Normally awards will be made for thefirst year only at this time; support for the second year will be contingenton the availability of funds and after review of the activities of thefirst year.NSF has specific provisions regarding allowable costs for salaries andwages, indirect costs, fringe benefits, equipment purchases, participantsupport costs, tuition remission, consultant services and subcontracts.In general the Young Scholars Program is subject to these provisions asstated in the GRESE referenced below and proposers must follow these provisionsin preparing the budget for a Young Scholars project.General NSF provisions of special relevance to this program as well asadditional <T3>program specific regulations </T3>are summarized below:andbullet; The Foundation will consider requests for extra compensation (overload).Such requests should be clearly outlined in the budget justification sectionand will be reviewed on an individual basis with attention to the natureof the project as well as institutional and current NSF policies.andbullet;  Support will not be provided for general purposes office equipmentsuch as typewriters or furniture, nor for permanent scientific equipment.Permanent equipment is defined as any item with a unit cost of $500 ormore and an expected service life of two or more years. Where such equipmentis deemed necessary, proposals should consider borrowing or renting. Rentalcosts are allowable under this program.andbullet;  Indirect costs will not be paid on participant costs.andbullet;  Funds should be included for the project director (one persononly) to attend the annual two-day project directors meeting in the Springin Washington, DC. Proposers should use their institutional guidelinesregarding per diem allowances.andbullet;  Support may not be requested for social activities, attendanceat any conference except the project directors meeting, or for teachertraining components.andbullet;  Proposers are advised to determine whether coverage normallyavailable to students and faculty on campus applies to participants inthese, projects. The budget may request funds to purchase health and accidentinsurance for participants not covered by the usual student health plans.Insurance costs should be specifically justified, and will be reviewedon a case-by-case basis.andbullet;  The Young Scholars Program requires a reasonable degree of cost-sharingin all proposals. Arrangements for cost-sharing should be clearly detailedin the proposal's budget justification section, and will be taken intoconsideration in decisions on the extent of NSF support. <T3>Fees assessed of participants are not considered cost-sharing.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Proposal Preparation and Submission</ITAG>Reference DocumentsA formal proposal should be prepared following the guidelines containedin the NSF document <T3>Grants for Research and Education in Science and Engineering</T3> [GRESE]NSF 83-57, rev. 11/87 and the instructions contained in this solicitation.Additional information may be obtained from the NSF <T3>Grants Policy Manual, Revised, NSF 77-47.</T3>Intergovernmental ReviewThis program is subject to intergovernmental review under the provisionsof E.O. 12372 and NSF regulations.
