John Keker, head of the prosecution team in the North case,disclosed the government's intentions Wednesday during a hearing inwhich U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell set a Jan. 31 trial datefor North.   North is charged with conspiring with former national securityadviser John Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retiredAir Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord to illegally divert more than $12million in U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.   North through his lawyer invoked his Fifth Amendment rightagainst self-incrimination last May in refusing to turn over to theSenate Foreign Relations Committee dozens of his spiral-boundnotebooks.   As a National Security Council aide, North took extensive noteson a variety of topics during phone calls and in the course of dailybusiness with people in and out of the Reagan administration.   The notebooks, some 2,848 pages in all, first came up intestimony before Congress in the Iran-Contra hearings last year andportions of them previously given to congressional investigatorsalso are sprinkled throughout with references to drugs, drugtraffickers, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the CIA. Butlarge segments _ committee aides said about half the contents _ havebeen blacked out by Brendan Sullivan, one of North's lawyers, or byWhite House censors.   Keker said the prosecution would file a motion in the next fewdays for the notebooks in North's possession, which he compiledwhile running the program to give covert aid to the Contra rebels inNicaragua.   Last May, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., chairman of the foreignrelations panel's narcotics subcommittee, complained that Sullivanwas ``custodian of documents that have been walked out of theworkplace of the most highly sensitive government agency that wehave.''   Gesell's decision to set a trial date was prompted by commentsfrom one of North's lawyers, Barry Simon, who said several keywitnesses in the case will be leaving the Reagan administration nextmonth ``for the four corners of the Earth.''   Keker, head of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh's trial team,said ``we certainly hope we can meet that date.''   Some uncertainty remains, however, whether North's trial actuallywill take place as scheduled.   U.S. intelligence specialists are trying to decide whether theycan permit disclosure of national security secrets contained inclassified documents that prosecutors want to introduce as evidence.   National security concerns have placed in jeopardy North's trialon the major conspiracy and theft charges, which involve extensiveuse of classified material. Other charges against him, such as lyingto Congress and illegal use of a tax-exempt foundation, involve suchmaterial to a much smaller extent.   Gesell ruled Dec. 12 that too much material relevant to the casehad been excised from the 300 classified documents that Walsh'sprosecution team wants to use as evidence at trial.   Gesell said that while the documents had all been properlyclassified, too much had been held back, especially if a jury was tounderstand the facts of the case.</TEXT></DOC>
