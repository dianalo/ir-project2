Today's Congress knows no such limits. On Monday,congressional Democrats announced a formal investigation intothe vague charges that the 1980 Reagan campaign cut a dealwith Iranians to delay the release of the hostages. No onehas mentioned a legislative purpose for the investigation, sothere may be no constitutional justification.</LP><TEXT>   A little thing like the Constitution poses no seriousbarrier to what looks like a partisan investigation, butthere is good reason for this limit on the power of Congressto score points against either alleged communists orpolitical opponents in the executive branch. In order toinvestigate, Congress is supposed first to identify somepending legislation related to Iran or hostages -- or ifanyone took the accusations of treason seriously, articles ofimpeachment for George Bush. Specifying the legislativepurpose would at least force Congress to accept someaccountability for whatever position its members took.   The Constitution aside, before any congressmen get tooexcited about who they will subpoena for what, they mightwant to answer a few interrogatories themselves:   Why do congressional Democrats think credible evidence ofa deal will emerge after their secret investigation?   Congress already knows there's probably no there there,thanks to an investigation by Democratic staffers and theGeneral Accounting Office that began in November, 1989.According to reports in the Washington Times -- which saidcongressional sources agreed to discuss the matter &quot;in hopesof short-circuiting the partisan politics already at work&quot; --staffers on several House committees conducted interviews onthe allegations as far away as Paris and Madrid. Among thoseinterviewed was Gary Sick, President Carter's advisor onIran, whose April 15 article in the New York Timesresurrected many of the charges. The investigation came upempty handed, though proving a negative is hard now thatWilliam Casey, the alleged ringleader, is dead.   House Speaker Tom Foley denies it, but Republicans saythey were kept in the dark about this investigation untilafter Mr. Sick's article appeared. House Minority LeaderRobert Michel last week sent a letter to Rep. Foley askinghim to &quot;please let me know if my staff has missed somethingfrom the GAO briefings.&quot; He added, &quot;In the meantime I willcontinue to insist that I know of no evidence to warrant aninvestigation.&quot;   The congressional staffers apparently found no evidencefor the claim, which Mr. Sick repeated with some hedging,that vice-presidential candidate George Bush was in Paristhree weeks before the 1980 election to cut a deal withIranians. The staffers visited a suburban Washington countryclub for evidence that Mr. Bush was there on the Sunday whenOctober Surprise boosters claimed they saw him in Paris. (Ihad thought the first confirmation that Mr. Bush lunched atthe club that day with Justice Potter Stewart and Mrs.Stewart was in this column on May 8.)   If there is an investigation, will Congress hold publichearings so that some of those smeared can respond?   Among the documents Rep. Michel released last week toargue against a formal investigation were correspondenceinvolving Judge Laurence Silberman. His sideline role in thesupposed conspiracy would make him an interesting witness inany public hearing.   In 1980, Reagan campaign aide Richard Allen asked Mr.Silberman, a former ambassador who now sits on the federalappeals court in Washington, to accompany him to a meetingwith someone who claimed to have contacts in Iran. When thecontact said he might be able to deliver the hostages to theReagan campaign, Judge Silberman recalls that he ended thefive-minute meeting by saying, &quot;We Americans have only onepresident at a time.&quot; He told the contact that if he had anyinformation he should give it to the Carter White House.   Judge Silberman's letters to several former Carter aides,including Mr. Sick and journalists Hodding Carter and LeslieGelb, help put the allegations into some context. &quot;I havewatched this tale grow from a little seed with amplefertilizer applied by Middle East entrepreneurs, psychoticsand those in the press whose political sympathies are all tooobvious,&quot; he wrote to Mr. Gelb at the New York Times a fewdays after Mr. Sick's article.   &quot;I admit to being angry at the various charges which atleast initially mentioned me tangentially,&quot; Judge Silbermanwrote to Hodding Carter. &quot;Even the worst that one couldbelieve about Casey's actions at the CIA would not lead areasonable man, in my view, to suspect that he (or anyoneelse) would deliberately endanger American lives purely forpartisan advantage.&quot;   Judge Silberman added, &quot;Your willingness to suspect theawful is, I am afraid, symptomatic of a profound sickness inAmerican politics -- the breakdown of a certain minimum trustacross party lines between those who serve, or have served,in senior government positions.&quot;   Will any investigation into arms for hostages begin withJimmy Carter? &quot;After nearly two hours of discussion, a draftmessage was prepared for President Carter's approval offeringa military package of about $150 million (including theaircraft spares) that would be made available upon therelease of the hostages.&quot;   This is how Mr. Sick in &quot;All Fall Down,&quot; his book on Iran,disclosed President Carter's secret arms-for-hostages offerof Oct. 11, 1980. This arms offer, which the Iraniansrefused, did not get any attention during the Iran-Contrahearings. Perhaps it should in any new hearings on thehostages. For that matter, it might be an educationalreminder to compare how President Carter handled the hostagecrisis in Iran with how President Bush liberated thethousands of &quot;human shields&quot; Saddam Hussein took in Iraq.   There is little prospect of a serious, nonpartisaninvestigation. October Surprise's various unnamed sources arehardly likely to testify even if there were addresses to sendsubpoenas. The convicted gun-runner sources would not makecredible witnesses. More likely, Congress will use itsquestionable power to investigate the October Surprise simplyto keep open the possibility that some proof could some dayappear.   There is a silver lining. It was this kind of abuse ofcongressional process in the McCarthy era that led theSupreme Court to shame Congress back into its constitutionalplace.</TEXT></DOC>
