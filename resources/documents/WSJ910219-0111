The trenches he's dug have been for sewage andirrigation, rather than for shelter from big guns. Still, Mr.Navarro is pondering trading in his farmer's sombrero for aU.S. Army helmet and a place on the battlefields of theMiddle East.   Scooping out a shovelful of earth for a waste-ditch forhis henhouse, Mr. Navarro says, &quot;This may be good practicefor the war.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   What entices Mr. Navarro -- and, apparently, the 30peasants, or campesinos, from this area who've already gonenorth with dreams of enlisting in the U.S. Armed Forces -- isthe military paycheck of $1,500 a month, about what a manearns in four months scratching out a living off the land.There is also the lure of obtaining the elusive green card,which Mexicans need to work legally in the U.S. Finally,there is the romance of war: Mr. Navarro imagines the envy ofvillagers, who move about in burro-drawn wagons and decrepitChevies, when they see photographs of him waving from theturret of a thundering tank.   &quot;I will be a hero,&quot; says the mud-caked Mr. Navarro,shouldering his shovel and marching off to a tool shed.   For decades, millions of rural Mexicans have enduredextreme hardships for the chance to work in the U.S.Campesinos have hopped boxcars, braved the Rio Grande andstowed away in pet compartments of airliners. Now they aretrying to fight their way into the U.S. The war in thePersian Gulf has set off a strange -- and unsolicited --south-of-the-border enlistment boom for the U.S. military. Asa local paper put it: There's &quot;War Fever Among theCampesinos]&quot;   In Tijuana, would-be enlistees are contacting the U.S.consulate at a rate of about 15 per day. Military recruitersin Texas are reporting calls from Mexicans living there. TheU.S. Embassy in Mexico City receives &quot;a couple of dozen callsa day,&quot; from would-be Mexican volunteers, a spokesman theresays.   Shoot-from-the-hip Mexican opinion leaders also havefanned the war flames. A Mexico City newspaper published anarticle stating that 40% of the allied soldiers in the Gulfare Mexicans. This assertion was denied by the Mexicangovernment, which has condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,but hasn't sent Mexican troops to the Gulf. Then, in anothertwist on the situation, the leader of Mexico's leftistopposition jumped on the stump to lament the plight of&quot;thousands of Mexicans that are already in the deserts ofArabia, enlisted in an army and under a flag that aren'tours.&quot;   The facts of the matter are quite different. The U.S.military accepts only citizens or permanent legal residents,a U.S. Embassy spokesman says. Mexican nationals offering toenlist have been told their &quot;interest is appreciated,&quot; thespokesman adds, but that Uncle Sam doesn't want them.   But all disclaimers arrived too late for Valle deSantiago, which had already fallen into a martial tizzy. Inthat area of about 70,000 souls, rumor circulated as fact,and &quot;fact&quot; became increasingly specific. The war-inflamedimagination of a local newspaper reporter was accountable foran article identifying 15 men from the region on active dutyin the Gulf. The paper's next issue included a reproductionof what was claimed to be a letter from the front lineswritten by a local grunt to his mother: The soldier washomesick but feeling better now that another local boy hadbeen transferred to his unit. So far, there have been noreports of Valle men being awarded medals for battlefieldheroism, &quot;but we are waiting for the news,&quot; says a reporter.&quot;We will be the first to run the story.&quot;   What put this village on a war footing was a magazinecalled Cultural Development, published in the nearby hamletof Tepatitlan. It seems that the editor, Juan Carlos BaezParedes, recently took a trip to California. A newspaper hebrought back with him contained a Spanish-language U.S.military recruiting advertisement aimed at the Southwest'sMexican-American population. In the January issue of CulturalDevelopment, Mr. Baez had some white space to fill next to anarticle about the Persian Gulf war. &quot;I did not think printingthe ad would mean, well, bringing the war here to Mexico,&quot; hesays.   The advertisement showed a drawing of a man with aquilineLatino features superimposed over the stars and stripes.&quot;U.S. Armed Forces, where opportunity awaits your sons,&quot; saidthe accompanying copy. The part that really got attentionhere was the salary -- in dollars.   It was not long before this magazine was in great demandin Valle de Santiago. &quot;It had the most impact of any editionwe've ever published,&quot; Mr. Baez says.   The ad's impact was magnified by the recent arrival of aphoto-copy machine, one of the village's first, to aphotography shop run by Oscar Arredondo. The campesinos madequick converts to the information age. &quot;Everyone wants tohave a copy of that ad,&quot; says Mr. Arredondo.   As fate would have it, Mr. Arredondo's shop is only acouple of doors from one of Valle de Santiago's mostvenerable cantinas. Putting a copy machine so close to adispensary of tequila was a recipe for mischief, if everthere was one. The combination of the copier's ink and thecantina's drink made the bar the center for scuttlebutt aboutthe war effort.   &quot;I don't know how Armando would handle one of those jets,when he barely knows how to handle a car,&quot; says one drinker,Mauro Rivas, referring to a neighbor who headed off to thenorth with the idea of becoming a fighter pilot. &quot;The Navypays more and has better food,&quot; a companion, Hilario Cruz,offers sagely.   As loose talk flowed, local authorities began to confronta succession of alarming developments. &quot;The key thing duringa period of war is to keep calm,&quot; says Police CaptainSalvador Silva Saldana. Bullnecked and meticulously-groomed,he is a small-town police chief out of central casting. Onthe wall hangs a framed copy of a meditation entitled: &quot;Yesson, your father is a public servant.&quot; Next to it, is a mapof the city bristling with pins coded in five colors.   The chief's interest was aroused when an unusual number oflocals came by to request good-conduct letters, which arecommonly sought by departing emigrants seeking to bolstertheir cases for U.S. residency. &quot;The number of requests wasvery high,&quot; he says. &quot;Then I heard about the war fever.&quot;   Just then, a call comes in on the radio behind his desk. Acouple of suspicious types have been spotted loitering nearthe local oil pipeline. Chief Silva's eyebrows leap. &quot;Get apatrol car there right away,&quot; he says. A fifth columnoperating in Valle de Santiago? &quot;You have to check outeverything,&quot; he says.   Far from remaining a local affair, however, the stories ofwar fever among the campesinos eventually reachedhigher-level Mexican officials, who were not amused. Afederal congressman demanded that foreign recruiters bedeported. A state official said that volunteers would forfeittheir Mexican citizenship.   Finally, a Mexican army intelligence officer came to ChiefSilva's office. &quot;He had lots of questions,&quot; says the chief'ssecretary, recounting the officer's visit to a group ofcampesinos seeking letters of good conduct. &quot;How many gringorecruiters were coming here? Why are people leaving? What areall these stories about Mexicans in the Gulf?&quot;   At that moment, a late-arriving campesino pokes his headthrough the doorway. &quot;The Mexican army,&quot; he asks, &quot;is goingto the Gulf, too?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
