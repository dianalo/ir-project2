Soybeans posted losses, most wheatcontracts made slight gains and corn finished nearly unchanged.   The decline in soybean prices was mostly due to profit-takingafter Monday's sharp advances, analysts said.   Wheat prices also did an about-face as traders bought contractsafter a fairly steep drop on Monday, said Victor Lespinasse, atrader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.   Contracts for May and July delivery of corn advanced marginallyin reaction to news that the government had granted one-yearextensions on certain corn loans taken out in 1984, 1985 and 1986.   The extensions mean farmers can delay decisions about marketinghundreds of millions of bushels of corn that might otherwise havegone onto the market this year, Lespinasse said.   Trading volume is expected to drop on Wednesday and Thursdayahead of two eagerly awaited Agriculture Department reports _ theannual spring planting intentions report and the quarterly grainstocks report _ due out after Thursday's close.   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher withthe contract for delivery in May at $3.01 a bushel; corn was 1 centlower to } cent higher with May at $2.11\ a bushel; oats were 1\cents lower to 3 cents higher with May at $1.63} a bushel; soybeanswere 3 cents to 6 cents lower with May at $6.51 a bushel.</TEXT></DOC>
