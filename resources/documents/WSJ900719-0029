With meatpackers bidding up prices for mature hogs to nearthe record levels set in May, some futures traders decided totake profits and not press their luck any further.</LP><TEXT>   In trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange yesterdaythe hog contract for August delivery dropped 0.87 cent apound to settle at 59.72 cents a pound.   The price of the August futures contract for pork bellies,which are used to make bacon, sank its daily permissiblelimit of two cents a pound to settle at 46.42 cents a pound.   Hog prices have been whipsawed for several months.   Because of a tight supply of mature hogs, the nation'sslaughter is running about 6% behind last year's pace. Thatis creating fierce competition among meatpackers for hogs.   On Monday, for example, prices of several hog futurescontracts jumped their daily permissible limit of 1.5 cents apound because of a sudden hog shortage.   Those high prices have also pushed up the consumer priceof pork to record levels. As a result, any sign of consumerresistance to high retail prices can trigger a wild plunge infutures prices.   &quot;We are waffling between supply bulls and demand bears,&quot;said Charles Levitt, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton,Chicago.   What triggered yesterday's sudden disinflationarysentiment isn't clear. The consumption of refrigerated porkbellies is running above analysts' estimates. That usuallywould support prices.   There were widespread rumors yesterday, however, that onemajor pork belly supplier suddenly lowered its price by twocents a pound -- igniting speculation that demand for pork iswavering.   Because the pork belly market is so thinly traded, themove by just one concern can shift prices. Analysts aredivided, however, over the impact of that price cut on themarket.   Cattle futures prices rose.   After the close of trading tomorrow traders expect theAgriculture Department to report that the number of youngcattle placed on feedlots in seven major ranch states in Junerose 2.5% from June 1989.   Feedlots fatten cattle for slaughter. Usually a rise inplacements signals that the supply of fattened cattle willincrease several months into the future, thus damping theprice that meatpackers will pay then.   Opinion is mixed, however, over whether cattle prices willbegin to retreat significantly anytime soon from their highlevels. During part of the trading session yesterday, thecattle contract for August delivery touched alife-of-contract high of 76.30 cents a pound.   Among other things, the Agriculture Department is alsoexpected to report that placements onto feedlots during theentire second quarter in 13 states trailed last year'slevels.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Petroleum futures closed mixed on little news.Although oil inventories still are high, expectations thatthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will curbits overproduction as a result of next week's midyear meetingkept a support for prices. Also, Iraq again figuredprominently in world oil markets on an unsubstantiated rumorthat it is massing troops on the Kuwait border. Energyfutures brokers have been trying to peddle that rumor forseveral days. But there were few takers until yesterday whenit resurfaced after Iraq's foreign minister accused Kuwait ofviolating the Iraqi border and stealing oil valued at $2.4billion. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been thechief targets of Iraqi complaints about OPEC quota cheaters.Yesterday's charges followed Tuesday's statement by PresidentSaddam Hussein of Iraq that he would deal forcefully withoverproducers in OPEC unless they mended their ways. But bothKuwait and the UAE already had pledged they will reduceoutput. So most traders were puzzled by the Iraqi troopsrumor and discounted it. Still, oil futures surged, if onlybriefly, on London's International Petroleum Exchange and theNew York Mercantile Exchange. The futures price for theInternational Petroleum Exchange's September Brent crudecontract closed 16 cents higher at $18.35 a barrel. In U.S.futures trading, the September crude contract settled at$19.61 a barrel, down 16 cents, after nudging $20 during theday. August crude was down 10 cents at $18.55.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: The July contract swung widely on its lastday of trading because a large number of outstandingcontracts remained to be nullified or fulfilled; but it endedbarely changed. The most active contract, September, eased.July traded from a low of $1.81 to a high of $1.88 beforeexpiring at noon EDT 0.10 cent a pound lower at $1.8685.September declined 2.55 cents a pound to $1.7585. The Julycontract showed early strength as traders who didn't want totake delivery of the concentrate hung on for a while beforeliquidating their positions, an analyst said. As the Julyprice dropped, processors bought contracts. Processors havebeen active buyers of contracts, with the intention of takingdelivery of concentrate because futures prices are well belowcash market quotes of $2 to $2.05 a pound, the analyst said.Trading turned thin as expiration neared; at one point, theprice jumped more than three cents a pound from one trade tothe next. Overall, the analyst said, &quot;It was a reasonablyorderly expiration. The fact that July ended 11 cents {apound} over September was a positive development that couldhelp provide September with further support.&quot;                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were mixed. Silver wasstrong and platinum edged higher, but gold couldn't sustainearly gains and ended lower. September silver advanced 6.7cents an ounce to $4.935. October platinum was up 30 cents anounce to $479.60. August gold ended with a loss of 50 centsan ounce at $362.50 after trading as high as $363.90.Yesterday's advance in silver was a continuation of therecovery in the metal Tuesday after the September pricedropped to its previously set life-of-contract low of $4.81.The contract Tuesday recovered most of its sharp loss andyesterday tacked on further gains as traders, particularlyspeculators, were attracted by the market's strongperformance. According to Peter Cardillo, director ofcommodity research for Jesup, Josephthal Inc., of New York, aslight change has taken place in fundamentals that hascontributed some support to the market. &quot;Some smaller silvermines in the U.S. and Canada have suspended productionbecause of low prices,&quot; he said. &quot;It isn't a majordevelopment, but it has injected a more positive note in themarket.&quot; If silver continues to attract demand, Mr. Cardillosaid, there is a possibility that the September contract'sprice could top $5 and possibly trade as high as $5.25.</TEXT></DOC>
