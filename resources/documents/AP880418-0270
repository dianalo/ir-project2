PAULSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Japan again asked the United States on Monday tolift trade sanctions imposed last year by President Reagan as aresult of American complaints over semiconductors sales.   Japan said that it had complied with requests to open itsmarkets to U.S.-made computer chips and that continued sanctionswould only irritate Japanese manufacturers.   The comments were made as Japan and the United States met inquarterly talks to review Japan's progress in opening its marketsto the U.S.-made chips. The sanctions entered their second yearSunday with no sign of a letup in the tough U.S. stance.   ``Continuing these sanctions will only damage the United Statesin the minds of Japanese users,'' said a trade official affiliatedwith the talks, who agreed to discuss the matter only if grantedanonymity. ``We find these sanctions very irritating.''   Reagan accused Japan of violating a 1986 agreement by sellingsemiconductors at below-market prices and failing to open its homemarket to American-made computer chips. He retaliated with tariffsof 100 percent on Japanese color television sets, calculators,computers and power drills.   Reagan later reduced the tariffs by $51 million, saying Japanhad made partial progress in complying with the agreement.   Shortly after the sanctions were announced, Sony Chairman AkioMorita said the action was regarded in Japan as the ``second comingof the black ships.''   Morita was referring to 1853, when U.S. Commodore Matthew Perrysailed into Shimoda harbor southwest of Tokyo and forced Japan _ atgunpoint _ to open its ports after two centuries of isolation.   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter recently told Japaneseofficials that it was still too early to lift the sanctions, andthat market access is still lower than expected.   Yeutter drew exasperated reactions from the Japanese tradeofficial, a representative of the Ministry of International Tradeand Industry.   ``It's unreasonable, I think, to continue the sanctions now. Ithink their expectations are too high. They expect to get 20percent of the Japanese market in five years. I think it will bevery difficult for them to achieve a 20 percent share,'' theJapanese official said.   ``It's time for (Japanese) users and U.S. makers to cooperate toincrease sales to Japan,'' he added.   According to figures compiled by MITI, U.S. chipmakers haveincreased their sales in Japan by 50 percent to 60 percent.However, the U.S. share of the market has not grown significantlybecause the Japanese market itself has expanded rapidly, creatinggreater demand.   Some Japanese companies were able to avoid significant impactfrom the sanctions by transferring production of the affectedmerchandise, such as portable computers, to the United States.Other companies were hit hard by the sanctions. According to someestimates, the damage inflicted on Japanese companies has alreadysurpassed the $300 million.   The United States estimates American firms also have lost $300million in sales in Japan because of the Japanese practices. But aU.S. Embassy spokesman earlier said the sanctions never weredestined to end when the damage they inflicted on Japan equalledthat suffered by American companies. He said the sanctions willcontinue ``until the basic situation changes.''   The embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidpart of Japan's $300 million figure represents tariffs collected onJapanese products coming into the United States, and partrepresents goods kept off the U.S. market because the Japanese canno longer compete at the higher prices.   The MITI official said Japan-U.S. talks would not be affected bya dispute among the European Economic Community, Japan and theUnited States over the semiconductor agreement.   The EEC has requested a three-way meeting to try and resolveEuropean complaints that the original chip agreement between Japanand the United States violates international trade rulesestablished by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</TEXT></DOC>
