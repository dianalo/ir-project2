<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-10-0054 </DOCNO><TEXT>The report is a result of the request by the Secretary of Energy, in February,1987, for the Energy Research Advisory Board to review the activitiesof the Department of Energy in science and engineering education to ensurethat DOE is playing its proper role to meet both its own project manpowerneeds as well as to work closely with the other federal agencies andthe private sector in the support of scientific and technical educationand training. The report concludes that without intervention now to ensurean adequate future manpower supply, the Department is unlikely to achieveits missions in energy and defense Randamp;D. The efforts that DOE has madeover the past few years to strengthen its science education programs,especially in the undergraduate and precollege areas, are discussed andopportunities for further strengthening these programs are identified.The report recommends that DOE continue to emphasize its educationalmission primarily through support of graduate students and postdoctoralfellows through university grants and contracts which simultaneouslyserve the research mission of the Department. At the precollege level,the report recommends that DOE target its efforts where it can realizethe greatest impact, namely by providing teachers with opportunitiesfor research participation to enhance their science backgrounds and theirinstructional strategies. The report notes that minorities and womenare underrepresented in science and engineering and recommends that DOEsupport increased participation in science education programs at alllevels, precollege through postdoctoral. The report also recommends thatDOE maintain a strong continuing education programs at its national laboratories,permit participation by local industries, and encourage private companiesinvolved in energy-related businesses to do more to support science andengineering education.</TEXT></DOC>
