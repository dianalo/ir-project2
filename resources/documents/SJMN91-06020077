Preeya told police that Carroll assured her having two wives wasperfectly legal in California, Deputy District Attorney Mike Fitzsimmonssaid.;    For about eight months, they lived under the same roof as husbandand wife -- and wife. The women spent alternate weeks sleeping with Carroll inthe master bedroom, according to testimony.;    But that ended in June, whenMarilyn Carroll called police and accused her husband of sexually assaultingher. As she spoke to officers in broken English, police say a curious taleemerged.;    &quot;I just wrote down what she told me and the D.A. said, 'Oh, lookat that!' &quot; said San Jose police officer Mike McLaren. &quot;I've never handled abigamy investigation before and I'll probably never handle one again.&quot;;   Carroll's attorney, James Thompson, could not be reached.;    Marilyn toldpolice she wanted a child, but that her husband had had a vasectomy. So, shesaid, she began seeing another man -- with Carroll's blessing.;    But,Carroll became jealous and started assaulting her, Marilyn said. She alsoalleged that he restrained her with thumbcuffs and other devices whilesexually assaulting her. In addition to bigamy, he has been charged with falseimprisonment.;    But Preeya, who still lives with Carroll, said she never sawher husband mistreat his other wife. And, she insisted, he's never mistreatedher.;    Testimony also indicated that Carroll put both wives to work atfast-food restaurants -- then took their paychecks from them. If theyprotested, he threatened to turn them in to immigration officials.;   Carroll's preliminary hearing in Municipal Court drew a larger than usualaudience of courthouse regulars. They were drawn, observers say, by testimonythat included Marilyn's description of a sadomasochistic wedding that she saysshe attended with her husband.;    She gave authorities an invitation,engraved with a 20-lash whip, welcoming guests to the home of &quot;Master Ernieand Slave Patricia&quot; for the wedding of another couple. The bride wore asee-through wedding dress, Marilyn Carroll testified.;    ProsecutorFitzsimmons said additional charges are likely to be filed. Meanwhile, Carrollis scheduled to be arraigned in Superior Court on Jan. 28.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ANN W.
