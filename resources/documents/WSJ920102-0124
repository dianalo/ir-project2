In a big way.   Disclosed fees earned by Wall Street investment banks forunderwriting new stocks and bonds jumped to $4.64 billion in1991, according to Securities Data Co. That's more thandouble 1990's paltry total of $1.94 billion and nearly asmuch as 1990 and 1989 combined. The only year underwritingfees were higher was in 1986, when they totaled $5.07billion.</LP><TEXT>   Two powerful forces combined to create Wall Street's feeexplosion: a surprising surge in initial public stockofferings and stock underwritings of seasoned companies; anda modest revival of high-yield junk-bond issues. These twosectors are highly profitable for Wall Street underwriters,which earn fees by buying new securities from corporateissuers and reselling the securities to the public.   The 1991 fee windfall provided a clear sign that WallStreet has begun to recover from a recession brought on bythe 1987 stock market crash. The underwriting arena hasprovided Wall Street's few big-ticket items in the 1990s,replacing the mergers-and-acquisition business, which remainsin the doldrums. Last year, underwriting fees were a drivingforce in Wall Street's profit rebound.   Don't expect quite as festive a fee party in 1992,however. That's because the bulk of this year's stockofferings are likely to be so-called secondary issues fromseasoned corporate clients -- not the more lucrative IPOs.   &quot;The IPO business will still be around, but at somewhatless as a percentage of the total,&quot; said Michael D. Madden,co-head of investment banking at the Lehman Brothers divisionof Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., an American Express Co.unit. &quot;While stock-underwriting fees may be greater overallin 1992,&quot; Mr. Madden adds, the shift means &quot;going from a5%-6% underwriting-fee business to a 2%-3% {underwriting-fee}business.&quot;   Either way, the fees earned from new-stock issues willcontinue to drive underwriting profits in 1992, manyinvestment bankers say. &quot;As long as there's a reasonablemarket environment, fees should be near&quot; 1991 levels,predicts Thomas W. Davis, managing director of equitytransactions at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.   Nearly every major investment bank enjoyed fatter feeslast year. Each of the securities firms in the top 10 posteda jump of at least $208 million in underwriting fees from1990 levels. After a slow 1990, &quot;for many investment banks,1991 proved to be the answer to their prayers,&quot; said MarkBasch, a Securities Data analyst.   Merrill was the big fee winner for the fourth year in arow. The U.S.'s largest securities firm earned $833.5 millionin disclosed fees in 1991, nearly $150 million more thanGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co., its nearest competitor. A major factorin Merrill's success: the continuing appeal of LYONs, orliquid yield option notes. This security is a form ofzero-coupon corporate bonds convertible either into the stockof the company that issues them, or into some other equityinstrument. Merrill helped bring to market 11 LYONs issues in1991, for fees totaling $77 million -- or a tad under 10% ofthe firm's total underwriting fee income.   But the outlook for this product -- one of Wall Street'shottest -- is uncertain for 1992. That's because the InternalRevenue Service late last year challenged the tax status ofLYONs. Merrill declined to comment on the outlook for LYONs.   Goldman came in second place in the fee race, with $686.9million. Goldman's fee total largely stemmed from the firm'ssuccess in lucrative stock offerings, which account for 60%of the firm's total underwriting volume. Morgan Stanley GroupInc. made strides in the underwriting fee race, jumping toNo. 3, with disclosed fees of $480 million, from No. 6, or$141 million, in 1990. Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc., with itsfocus on profitable IPOs, ranked No. 4, with $447.6 millionin underwriting fees.   But Salomon Brothers Inc. was hurt by its Treasury-auctionbidding scandal. Although the Salomon Inc. unit had moreunderwriting business, it fell to No. 7 from No. 3 in the feerankings with a total of $289.7 million. That figure compareswith total fees of $192.9 million in 1990.   The fee tables give the best guide available to the topWall Street underwriters. But the rankings don't necessarilypaint a clear picture of the actual profits earned fromunderwriting among securities firms, investment bankers say.The numbers reflect only disclosed fees; on some deals,particularly mortgage-backed deals and derivativetransactions, fees aren't fully shown.   Full credit for fees is given to the lead manager in anunderwriting syndicate; in reality, those fees typically arespread among several investment banks. But issues soldthrough so-called competitive bids, in which investment bankssubmit their best price for a deal, generally areloss-leaders for Wall Street firms. And asset-backed debtdeals often contain agreements to rebate part of the fee backto the issuer, investment bankers say.   The 1991 fee surge on Wall Street was bolstered by abanner crop of IPOs, which averaged a fee of 6.2% of thedeals' proceeds, according to IDD Information Services.So-called secondary stock offerings of seasoned companiesaveraged about 4% per deal, and preferred stock, 2.6%, IDDsaid.   An indication of just how important new stock issues wereto the profit party in 1991: Fees from new stock issuesaccounted for 71% of fee volume in 1991 -- but just 13% ofthe underwriting volume, according to IDD.   Bond-underwriting deals generally are far less lucrativefor investment banks. The average fee for each straight debtissue, for instance, was 0.63% in 1991; convertible debtdeals averaged 2.24% of transaction proceeds, IDD said.   Still, average fees from underwriting bond issues couldcreep up as more and more investment banks createcustom-tailored derivative products, some Wall Streetexecutives assert. Derivatives -- not exactly stocks, notexactly bonds -- are hybrid securities that move in relationto an underlying index, stock, bond, currency or commodity,or some combination. &quot;These {derivative} deals are morecomplex and sophisticated, which in turn can justify higherfees,&quot; says Roger M. Vasey, head of Merrill's debt marketsgroup.   The fee rebound was given a surprise boost from a busynew-issue calendar among junk bonds. After nearlydisappearing in 1990, 47 new junk-bond issues were brought tomarket in 1991, far more than the 10 issued in 1990. The feesthe new junk bonds brought totaled more than $174 million,for an average fee per deal of about $4 million.   ---        Disclosed Fees From New Issue Underwriting                                                                                                                    1991                           1990  --------------------------  ------------------------------   AMOUNT             NUMBER   AMOUNT                 NUMBER  millions)   SHARE   ISSUES  millions)  RANK  SHARE  ISSUES                                                                                                        Merrill Lynch   $833.5      18.0%    567    $326.9      1   16.8%    372                                                                                                        Goldman Sachs    686.9      14.8     454     245.7      2   12.6     200                                                                                                        Morgan Stanley    480.0      10.3     281     141.0      6    7.3     191                                                                                                        Alex.
