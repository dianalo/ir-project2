There are anumber of things coming together for Continental that is causing usto be able to expand.''   He pointed to Department of Transportation statistics whichshowed customer complaints about Continental were down 96 percentsince 1987 and on-time arrival performance for Continental was thethird best among the nation's airlines in 1989.   Hula also credited an improvement in Continental's financialcondition for the schedule expansion.   Although the airline lost $56.1 million in the fourth quarter of1989, the loss was $43.1 million less than the October-Decemberperiod the previous year. For all of 1989, Houston-basedContinental, a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., showed a $3.1 millionprofit.   Twenty-three planes are being added to the Continental fleet,including jets that were bought from sister carrier EasternAirlines and returned to Continental after being leased to Easternand Pan Am Corp., Hula said.   He had no details on fares on the new flights.   ``There will be some pricing initiatives,'' he said. ``We willbe very competitive throughout the summer with all of our fares.''   Beginning May 15, Continental will operate flights from Houstonto Panama City, Panama, and San Jose, Costa Rica, giving theairline the largest number of U.S. flights to Central America, Hulasaid. Continental already has flights to Belize, El Salvador,Guatemala and Honduras.   ``We look to expand in Central America even further as timepasses,'' Hula said. ``The changing conditions in Panama obviouslymake this service possible. The improving political climate has agreat deal to do with our interest in Central America.''   In the United States, Continental is starting late-night serviceout of Houston with a dozen flights leaving at 10:30 p.m.   ``These flights bridge a gap between evening travel and theovernight `red-eye' flights,'' he said. ``While 10:30 p.m. may seemlate to many people, we believe there is sufficient demand at thistime of day to warrant the implementation of a new `bank' offlights.''   Elsewhere, new service is being added from Cleveland, Ohio, toLouisville, Ky., and Norfolk, Va. From Newark, N.J., service isbeing added to Greensboro, N.C.; Norfolk, Va.; Columbia, S.C.; andAntigua, West Indies. Those flights start May 1.   Hula said the additional flights could prompt non-unionContinental to hire nearly 1,000 new workers, including about 200pilots and 600 flight attendants.</TEXT></DOC>
