The union, which represents 13,000 Ford hourly workers and 4,900 company pensioners in Canada, has made improved pensions its top priority in talks with the Canadian units of the Big Three U.S. auto makers.    The union began negotiations Tuesday with General Motors Corp.'s Canadian unit, yesterday with Ford's unit, and it is to open talks today with Chrysler Corp.'s unit. Contracts with all three companies expire Sept. 14.    Donald McKenzie, Ford Motor Co. of Canada's lead negotiator and vice president of industrial relations, made the remarks on the pension issue after the opening bargaining session with the union. He added that he believes inflation-indexed pensions have no place in the type of contract currently being negotiated.    Robert White, president of the Canadian Auto Workers, said that Mr. McKenzie &quot;didn't rule out&quot; considering indexed pensions during the opening bargaining session, and that the union doesn't insist on full indexing. Mr. White said Ford's hourly workers currently receive adjustments equal to 90% of the inflation rate, &quot;so I guess (the union) could move that far in terms of a compromise&quot; on pensions.    Negotiators will conduct local-level talks until Aug. 10, when national talks at Ford are scheduled to resume. </TEXT></DOC>
