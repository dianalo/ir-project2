The addition of Coastal Midland Inc. as a general equity partner means CMS Energy has obtained all but $75 million of the total $425 million in third-party equity needed for the conversion. William T. McCormick Jr., CMS Energy chairman and chief executive officer, said the company expects to obtain agreements for the remainder &quot;soon.&quot;    Houston-based Coastal is an oil, natural gas and coal producer and pipeline operator. Other partners in the Midland Cogeneration Venture are Midland, Mich.,-based Dow Chemical Co.; Baden, Switzerland-based BBC Brown Boveri Inc.; Irvine, Calif.-based Fluor Corp., and Houston-based Panhandle Eastern Corp. Consumers Power has put up the plant, valued at $1.5 billion, in return for a 49% stake in the venture.    The plant, which was abandoned as a nuclear facility because of high costs and production delays, is scheduled to begin supplying steam and electricity in 1990 to Dow and Consumers Power's electric customers in Michigan.    The new venture also entered into gas transportation agreements with ANR Pipeline Co., another Coastal unit, under which ANR Pipeline will provide about 45 million cubic feet a day of gas transportation service required by the plant.    Separately, Consumers Power and ANR Pipeline announced agreement on a new 12-year contract under which Consumers Power will use ANR Pipeline's transportation service for 40 billion cubic feet of natural gas annually by 1990. Mr. McCormick said the agreement &quot;allows Consumers Power to diversify significantly its natural gas supply by utilizing ANR in addition to its traditional pipeline suppliers . . . (and) could also result in reduced gas purchase costs in the near term.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
