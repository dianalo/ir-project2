The area encompassing New York City and northeastern New Jerseyexperienced job growth in almost all other industries, but at theslowest rate in the past six years, the federal Bureau of LaborStatistics reported Tuesday.   Between December 1987 and October 1988, the region added 99,000jobs for a total of 8.22 million, said Samuel I. Ehrenhalt, regionalcommissioner of the bureau.   The increase represented an annual growth rate of 1.5 percent,compared to the national growth rate of 3.4 percent, he said.   New York City's overall gain was less than 1 percent in 1988, or23,000 new jobs _ proof that the city's ``economy has clearly lostmomentum in the aftermath of the (October 1987) stock marketcrash,'' Ehrenhalt said.   ``Jobs on Wall Street declined by 12,000 after adding an averageof 11,000 jobs a year in the prior five years, a period in which thesecurities industry accounted for a fourth of all job growth in thecity's private economy.''   But area unemployment rates were mostly lower than the nationalaverage, according to Ehrenhalt's review.   Joblessness in the region was 3.9 percent for the first 10 monthsof 1988, down from 4.5 percent the previous year.   Only Hudson County in New Jersey, with 6.4 percent, was higherthan the national rate of 5.6 percent.   Eight of the 23 counties of the region were below 3 percentunemployment and three of them _ Hunterdon, Morris and Somerset inNew Jersey _ were below 2{ percent.   New York City showed an 18-year low in joblessness, 4.9 percentfor the first 11 months of 1988. The decline was across the board,reflected in better figures regardless of race, sex and age.   But Ehrenhalt added that the lower rates ``primarily reflectcutbacks in the number of job seekers.''   Nationally, about 66 percent of the working age population isactive in the job market, but in New York City the figure is only 55percent, he said.   Another exception to the general job expansion in the region wasblue-collar factory work. Manufacturing here continued itsdecades-old decline, falling to a post-World War II low of 1.17million jobs in the 23-county metropolitan area, Ehrenhalt said.   The slowdown in growth was least pronounced in the New Jerseyportion of the metropolitan area, Ehrenhalt said.   In northeastern New Jersey, private sector employment increasedby 2.1 percent last year, compared to 3 percent the previous year,but it still amounted to 42,000 added jobs. Public hiring alsopicked up slightly.   Long Island and the suburban counties north of the city added16,000 jobs, a 1.1 percent increase, but far below the growth of theprevious four years.   The region covered by Ehrenhalt's report takes in the fivecounties of New York City and the New York state counties of plusNassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Orange and Putnam, plus theNew Jersey counties of Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Hunterdon, Middlesex,Monmouth, Morris, Sussex, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset and Union.</TEXT></DOC>
