Their focus: Saudi Arabia's oil production, which expertsdeem to be the difference between adequate or short globalpetroleum supplies. Crucial to world-wide energy security isthe Saudi pledge to boost production by two million barrelsdaily, an action that will make up half of the output lost tothe Iraq-Kuwait embargo.</LP><TEXT>   Even with that additional production, &quot;the oil market isvery tight, with no slack,&quot; says John Lichtblau, chairman ofPetroleum Industry Research Foundation. &quot;If anythingtechnical goes wrong elsewhere in the world, there will be ashortage.&quot;   Industry experts say the big worry in any military faceoffisn't only that an Iraqi strike would knock out Saudi oilfields. It is the potential immobilization of Ras Tanura,Saudi Arabia's primary export facility on the Persian Gulf.According to one executive familiar with the port, equipmentthere is densely situated and vulnerable. And with Ras Tanuracrippled, the Saudis would be hard put to export as much ashalf of the 7.5 million barrels of daily production they havepromised.   &quot;If four million barrels out of Ras Tanura is lost, theworld is in bad shape,&quot; says one high-ranking oil executive.&quot;We'd have to turn to inventory; in the U.S., to theStrategic Petroleum Reserve.&quot;   So far, most oil experts believe that the Saudis, backedby the U.S., would have adequate warning of an Iraqi strike,as well as the capability of shooting down attacking missilesor aircraft. &quot;Anti-missile systems have been put in place andAWACs {special radar aircraft} are in the air,&quot; says one oilexecutive.   But strategists still ponder alternatives. The Saudiscould boost exports via pipeline to the Red Sea port of Yanbuto 3.2 million barrels a day from current 1.5 millionbarrels. That pipeline, experts say, is underused because itis cheaper to export oil through the Persian Gulf on tankers.   If the loading wharves at Ras Tanura were put out ofaction, oil industry officials also say tankers could stilltake on oil from low-lying Sea Island facilities constructedalmost 1.5 miles offshore the port. &quot;They don't have muchmass, so they'd be harder to hit&quot; than onshore facilities,says one expert.   It hasn't been easy for combatants in the past to shutdown fully Persian Gulf oil shipping. Iraq couldn't seem toincapacitate Kharg Island, Iran's primary export facility,during their bitter eight-year war. Despite repeatedairstrikes on loading facilities there, Iran was able to keepoil moving by feverishly rebuilding after each hit.   And many independent tankers, scared away from Kharg bythe high risk of attack, filled up on Iranian crude at Lavanand Sirri Islands in the southern tip of the Persian Gulf. Tomove the oil to those islands, the Iranians created their ownshuttle of tankers -- some with highly paid commandos onboard whose sole mission was to save cargo and crew in caseof attack.   In the current crisis, the heavy presence of naval vesselsin the Gulf is expected to lessen the peril to shipping andmake closure of the Strait of Hormuz improbable.   &quot;If fighting breaks out, we don't envision any majordisruptions to other OPEC producers&quot; in the Persian Gulf orelsewhere, says Brice A. Sachs, principal with InternationalEnergy Consultants Ltd. and a former Exxon executive. Outputfrom Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Iran and even tinyBahrain should continue unimpeded, experts say, though theynote those producers couldn't replace Saudi barrels thatmight be lost to a war.   However, attacks on production or export facilities ofSaudi Arabia would probably drive oil prices to $40 a barrelwithin days, oil industry executives say privately. Refinersheavily dependent on Middle Eastern production, such as StarEnterprises, Texaco Inc.'s joint venture with the Saudis,would be especially vulnerable.   In theory, the impact should be delayed. Middle East oil,known within industry circles as &quot;long-haul&quot; crude, can takeas many as six weeks to reach the U.S. Thus it should takethat long before a supply pinch is felt. But in a market sodriven by psychology, perception of a shortage is all itwould take to tighten supplies and drive up prices. Hoardingwould undoubtedly take most, if not all, surplus barrels offthe market immediately.   Even without any loss of Saudi production, crude-oilsupplies are expected to tighten as winter demand picks up.&quot;By October, the world will be demanding more oil than it cansupply,&quot; with much of the current inventory overhang paredaway, says John Redpath, analyst for Energy Security AnalysisInc.   Analysts predict that the one-million-barrel dailyproduction shortfall anticipated in the months ahead willgrow to two million barrels as energy needs increase in coldweather. The only way out of that, says Tom Burns, manager ofeconomics for Chevron Corp., will be for higher oil prices todamp demand and reduce consumption.   Already, in efforts to secure sufficient oil supplies,some major U.S. refiners are trying to squeeze extra barrelsfrom producing countries with which they already have supplycontracts. All potential sources of additional supplies arecurrently being examined. The trading room at one of thenation's largest oil companies has at times been operating ona 24-hour basis to ensure that enough crude supplies will beavailable.   Actual oil supplies aren't yet short, experts say. And theParis-based International Energy Agency says it will take ashortage of 7% before a so-called sharing agreement among itsmembers goes into effect. That plan, once activated, willcall upon most of the industrialized world to uniformly drawdown inventories and cut consumption, possibly throughrationing.</TEXT></DOC>
