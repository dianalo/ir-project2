DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican conservatives in Congress are waryof the Nicaraguan cease-fire, with one saying the United States mayhave to ``take some action with external forces'' if the Contrarebels quit the field.   ``It's down to that,'' said Rep. Rod Chandler, R-Wash. ``It'sdefinitely a new era.''   Chandler was among GOP conservatives attending a retreat Fridayin Houston. In Washington, meanwhile, President Reagan said that``there is reason to have caution'' about whether Nicaragua'sleftist government will keep its agreements.   Reagan's comments were his first statement in any detail on the60-day nationwide cease-fire announced Wednesday in Sapoa,Nicaragua, by leaders of the Sandinista government and theU.S.-backed Contra guerrilla force.   ``Of course we look forward to this and hope it continues, but... just as in some other meetings that have gone on in which Ihave been involved, I think that we should keep in mind that bothparties must be dedicated to the things that are said and agreed toin those meetings,'' the president said.   ``I think there is reason to have caution _ they have a pastrecord that indicates that we should be,'' he added.   Reagan was questioned by reporters as he prepared to meet withPresident Joaquin Balaguer of the Dominican Republic.   In a formal statement as he appeared with Balaguer in the RoseGarden after the meeting, Reagan commended the Dominican presidentfor hosting previous Nicaraguan peace talks, mediated by RomanCatholic Cardinal Obando y Bravo.   ``We both hope for democratic and peaceful solutions to theproblems of the region,'' he said. ``We want to see an end to thepursuit of military solutions and to the massive Soviet armamentthat fuels that pursuit.''   During his daily White House news briefing earlier, presidentialspokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration believes ``thatthis agreement has been reached by both sides in good faith'' butis ``skeptical of the compliance.''   ``We're very hopeful that it works,'' Fitzwater said. ``We wantto do whatever we can to see that it works.''   The spokesman also said the administration is ``very hopeful''that a package of humanitarian assistance to the Contras can beapproved by the House and Senate before Congress' Easter recess.   He said the United States had no intention of entering intodirect discussions with the Sandinistas, as suggested by NicaraguanPresident Daniel Ortega.   ``We've discussed that two years,'' Fitzwater said. ``The answeris no.''   At the Houston retreat, Chandler said that if the Contras foldtheir tents and it is ``back to the usual Sandinista behavior'' oftotalitarian rule, the United States will have to ``take someaction with external forces ... external, including the UnitedStates.''   Chandler, who has co-sponsored a plan to renew military aid tothe Contras, said he expected Congress in the meantime to approverapidly some new humanitarian support for the Contras with theoption of adding military aid if things turn sour.   In Washington, other conservatives criticized the agreement, butappeared willing to put the Sandinistas to the test and wait to seewhether promised democratic reforms materialize.   ``It's an agreement that's shaded on the bad side,'' said Sen.James McClure, R-Idaho.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said, ``A sense of euphoria is not inorder ... I don't believe I've ever heard of a leopard changing hisspots.''   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said, ``The end product of whatthey've agreed to still leaves a Soviet puppet state in CentralAmerica.''</TEXT></DOC>
