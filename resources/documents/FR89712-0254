The detainer (Form I-247) merely serves to notify the correctionalinstitution that the Service wishes to assume custody of the alien uponthe alien's release from confinement. The correctional institution hasfull discretion in such concerns as security level of confinement, quartersassignment and offender classification, furloughs and work release. Thesematters can be accomplished without any concurrence from the Service. 8U.S.C. 1251(h) prohibits an alien sentenced to imprisonment to be deporteduntil such imprisonment has been terminated by the release of the alienfrom confinement.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner certifies that thisrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. This is not a major rule within the meaning of section1(b) of E.O. 12291, nor does this rule have federalism implications warrantingthe preparation of a Federal Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 8 CFR Part 242</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Deportation.Accordingly, Part 242 of Chapter I of Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulationsis amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 242_PROCEEDINGS TO DETERMINE DEPORTABILITY OF ALIENS IN THE UNITEDSTATES: APPREHENSION, CUSTODY, HEARING, AND APPEAL</ITAG>1. The authority citation for Part 242 is revised to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>8 U.S.C. 1103, 1182, 1186a, 1251, 1252, 1254, 1362,8 CFR 2.</ITAG>2. In andSection; 242.2, paragraph (a)(1) is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 242.2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Apprehension, custody, and detention.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Detainers in general. </T3>(1) Only an immigration officer as definedin section 101(a)(18) of the Act, or andSection; 103.1(q) of this chapteris authorized to issue a detainer (Form I-247). Detainers may only be issuedin the case of an alien who is amenable to exclusion or deportation proceedingsunder any provision of the law. A Service detainer should not be construedby a correctional institution as a demand that the alien's security levelof confinement, quarters assignment and offender classification, furloughs,work release and related matters be affected. Such matters are within thediscretion of the correctional institution in accordance with its own individualpolicies and procedures and do not require the concurrence of the Service.A detainer merely serves to notify the correctional institution that theService wishes to assume custody of the alien upon the alien's releasefrom confinement. The detainer will serve to place a ``hold'' on the alienonly upon the alien's actual release from confinement. No detainer shallbe issued in the case of an alien who is in the United States without legalauthority and is eligible to apply, or has applied, for legalization orspecial agricultural worker status under the provisions of section 245Aor 210 of the Act, unless the Service has denied, or has issued a noticeof intent to deny, the benefit for which applied. <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated June 27, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Clarence M.
