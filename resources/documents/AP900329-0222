Henning Christophersen, vice president of the trading bloc, saidin a recent interview that the economic merger of the 12 countries``is now going to be part of the European architecture.''   ``It is not only an ambition for some governments or for thecommission,'' the European Community's executive body, he said.   Finance ministers of the Common Market nations plan to meet thisweekend in western Ireland to discuss informally their plans for amonetary union that eventually would lead to a single currency inWestern Europe.   In advance of the meeting, Christophersen said the governmentscould follow a faster schedule to meet their ambitious goals.   The monetary plans are part of the community's campaign toremove trade barriers among the dozen nations by late 1992 andcreate a single market of some 320 million consumers.   The recent political upheavals in Eastern Europe have promptedmany to urge a stepped-up pace in efforts to tightly link thenations.   Many of the trading partners want West Germany's powerhouseeconomy firmly anchored in the community. Many of their currenciesare tied to the strong German mark and decisions by Germany'sinflation-conscious central bank affect their economies as well.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl traveled to Brussels lastFriday to reassure trading partners that Germany had no intentionof going its own way.   The community is considering a three-stage blueprint foreconomic and monetary union that calls for a European System ofCentral Banks, dubbed EuroFed, and use of the Ecu _ the Europeancurrency unit _ as the common currency.   Christophersen said the plan's second stage, marked by thecentral bank system, could begin as early as Jan. 1, 1993.   Last week, he unveiled a proposal drawn up by the community'sexecutive body to establish the new EuroFed institution tocoordinate monetary policy among the dozen nations. Each countrynow has its own central bank to set monetary policy.   EuroFed was patterned after the independent central banks of theUnited States and West Germany. It would be controlled by a councilmade up of the 12 central bank governors and a smaller group ofdirectors. Directors would be appointed for long terms.   The Common Market leaders plan a special conference nextDecember in Italy to make needed revisions in their founding Treatyof Rome for putting the EuroFed system in place.   Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand have indicated thetalks should end by mid-1991.   Once the treaty revisions are drawn up, it will take a year orso for ratification by all nations, said Christophersen.   He gave no date for the start of the third stage on monetaryunion, during which the Ecu would be introduced as the jointcurrency. But, he said, it would be better for the economic systemto move quickly to that phase.   The first stage of the monetary plan will go into effect on July1 when governments coordinate much more closely their economic andmonetary policies. Moreover, capital and exchange controls will beabolished so money can move freely among the nations.   The plan calls for all currencies to be linked in the exchangerate mechanism of the European Monetary System, which keeps theirvalues roughly steady within certain ranges. The currencies ofBritain, Portugal and Greece remain outside the linkage.   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who has resistedentering the pound into the mechanism, has promised to do so buthas given no timetable.   She has opposed calls for the sweeping monetary changes, arguingthat such plans would force countries to give up some of theirsovereignty to new institutions.   However, a British alternative proposal to make all Europeancurrencies legal tender throughout the Common Market has gatheredlittle support.</TEXT></DOC>
