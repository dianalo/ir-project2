Moreover, they now say the numbers of that crushing defeat arenot really as bad as they appeared at first blush.   The party leaders wound up their weekend meeting in Portland,Ore., professing to be on a roll and eager to adopt a moreaggressive stance against a Republican president and party theymaintain is being torn by festering internal strife _ a malady moreoften associated with Democrats.   Their next order of business is to select the site for their1992 convention. Party officials say it will be New York City,barring a last-minute snag.   ``We have got a Republican Party that is unraveling, being tornasunder'' Democratic Chairman Ronald Brown said in an interviewbefore leaving Portland. ``They no longer have the Cold War andtaxes to run on and we as Democrats are beginning to speak with onevoice.''   For all the newfound optimism, there remained plenty ofdiscouraging signs for Democrats to hash over at their meeting ofstate party leaders: Bush remains at near-record highs infavorability polls, voters still express more faith in Republicans'ability to manage the economy and the GOP still far surpasses theDemocrats in raising money.   Yet the state chairmen and national party officials see a chanceto capitalize on President's Bush abandonment of his ``no newtaxes'' pledge, his veto of family leave legislation and hishandling of the savings and loan crisis.   After months of moaning about Bush's perceived invincibility,Democrats suddenly are talking of mounting a serious challenge in1992.   Much of the optimism is based on growing satisfaction among thestate leaders with Brown, who after 18 months on the job appearsready and more willing to fill a partisan void often felt withinthe party because of the cooperative style of Democraticcongressional leaders.   ``There is a growing sense of anger that is causing things tobreak politically,'' said John Marino, the New York stateDemocratic chairman. ``The break hasn't come our way yet but it'sthere, and we have to step into the void with a saleable message.''   The Democrats took the unusual step in Portland of publiclydissecting the disastrous 1988 campaign of party nominee MichaelDukakis to underscore the theme that victory in 1992 is not as faraway as generally perceived.   With a series of colorful charts and maps, party politicaldirector Paul Tully showed the state chairmen what he saidinitially came as a shock to him: that despite winning only 10states, Dukakis got more votes in 324 of the nation's 436congressional districts than Walter Mondale did in 1984 and thatBush got fewer than Ronald Reagan.   Brown has staked his reputation as chairman on preventing arepeat of 1988 _ when Dukakis sent primary campaign aides intounfamiliar states to run the general election, in most casesignoring veteran local leaders.   ``We're watching a drama of failed leadership in the WhiteHouse,'' said Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, who pumped up the stateleaders with a populist rallying cry. ``It is our job as Democratsto stand up and point out the differences between us and them.''   Although Bush's reversal on taxes presents the Democrats with anunexpected political opportunity, they face risks of their own inthe ongoing budget talks.   In exchange for his concession on taxes, Bush is seeking curbson Social Security and other entitlements, support of which longhas been the bread-and-butter of Democratic rhetoric.   ``We have to be very careful here, in this time ofopportunity,'' said Ohio Democratic Chairman James Ruvolo. ``If thepublic perceives the rich get a better deal out of these talks thanthe middle class, then we as a party will have a major problem. Butright now things are looking up for us.''</TEXT></DOC>
