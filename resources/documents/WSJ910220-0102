The probation office's calculation will be used by thefederal Parole Commission to determine how much of his10-year sentence Mr. Milken will have to spend in prison.Under probation guidelines, which take into account thelosses suffered by crime victims, the $685,614 calculationmeans Mr. Milken could be released after serving 24 months.The recommendation isn't binding on the commission, however.</LP><TEXT>   The relatively low measure of investor losses is somewhatmisleading because it includes only those sixsecurities-related offenses to which Mr. Milken pleadedguilty. As part of his settlement of the government's caseagainst him last year, Mr. Milken agreed to pay $400 millionas restitution for victims of any additional securities fraudthat private plaintiffs can link to his activities. Mr.Milken is the former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'sjunk-bond department.   &quot;That number ($685,614) is so infinitesimal compared withthe damage Michael Milken caused that it's laughable,&quot; saidWilliam Lerach, an attorney with the plaintiffs' firm ofMilberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie andamp; Lerach. &quot;I wish I knew aword smaller than infinitesimal.&quot;   Even just for the six crimes to which Mr. Milken pleadedguilty, the probation figure is much lower than theprosecutors' office had hoped. According to the U.S.Attorney's office, which brought the criminal case againstMr. Milken, his admitted crimes caused nearly $5 million inlosses to victims.   At a hearing in federal court in Manhattan, Judge KimbaWood, who sentenced Mr. Milken, said she agreed with theprobation office that the losses stemming from the sixadmitted crimes apparently fall below $1 million. If thelosses totaled $1 million or more, the parole guidelineswould recommend that 40 to 52 months be served before Mr.Milken was eligible for parole.   Still, Judge Wood said she believed that calculated lossesdon't adequately reflect the damage Mr. Milken caused forsecurities markets and investors. She said that in sentencingMr. Milken to 10 years, she had intended that he serve aminimum of 36 to 40 months before parole.   She said Mr. Milken deserved to spend more time in prisonthan former stock speculator Ivan Boesky, who served abouttwo years before being paroled. Although Judge Wood said Mr.Boesky caused losses greater than $1 million, she said Mr.Milken should spend more time in prison &quot;taking into accountthe relative harm to confidence in the integrity of thesecurities markets caused by each man's crimes.&quot; She alsonoted that Mr. Boesky, whose cooperation led to theprosecution of Mr. Milken, has been described as &quot;the mostuseful cooperator in the history of the securities laws.&quot;   In calculating the losses, the probation office agreed tomost of the arguments offered by Mr. Milken's attorneys,Judge Wood said. John Carroll, the assistant U.S. Attorneyhandling the prosecution, declined to comment on theprobation office's calculation. But he said, &quot;We have theright to put in documents with the parole commission, and wewill do that.&quot;   Shareholders' attorneys said the probation office'scalculation was to be expected based on Mr. Milken's narrowplea agreement.   Dozens of civil suits allege that Mr. Milken causedbillions of dollars in damages to investors. Because theallegations deal with many transactions that aren't linked tothe crimes Mr. Milken admitted, the probation calculationisn't likely to affect those lawsuits, plaintiffs' attorneyssaid.   A spokesman for Mr. Milken declined to comment on thedecision. Mr. Milken is scheduled to begin serving hissentence March 4.   ---   DEATH ROW INMATE gets conditional pardon from Virginiagovernor.   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder granted a conditional pardon toconvicted murderer Joseph Giarratano, an inmate on Virginia'sdeath row for 12 years whose essay on capital punishment isscheduled to be published by the Yale Law Journal next week.   Mr. Giarratano is the first death row inmate to be sparedby Mr. Wilder, once an opponent of capital punishment who hasturned down three last-minute appeals from prisoners headedfor the electric chair since he became governor. Mr.Giarratano was convicted of murdering a woman and herteen-age daughter in 1979 and was scheduled to die Friday. Acoalition of liberals and conservatives ranging from AmnestyInternational to columnist James J. Kilpatrick joined forcesto argue that Mr. Giarratano's life be spared on the groundthere is reasonable doubt about his guilt.   Mr. Wilder gave no explanation for his decision, otherthan to say, &quot;it is based upon the circumstances of this caseand the evidence. . . .&quot; His office wouldn't comment further.Under the terms of the pardon, Mr. Giarratano will beeligible for parole after serving a total sentence of 25years. He has served 12.   The pardon gives him the option of seeking a new trial,but only if he waives his &quot;double jeopardy&quot; right not to betried twice for the same offense. His attorneys said hehadn't decided whether to seek such a trial.   Mr. Wilder was widely criticized in October for rejectingnumerous appeals to spare the life of Wilbert Evans, a deathrow inmate who had shielded nurses and guards seized ashostages during a 1984 prison break in which he refused toparticipate.   Mr. Wilder's chief legal counsel said each case wasdecided solely on the basis of evidence presented.   ---   FINLEY KUMBLE CREDITORS likely to receive small portion oftheir claims.   Francis Musselman, bankruptcy trustee for the defunctnational law firm of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine,Underberg, Manley, Myerson andamp; Casey, disclosed in court papersthat he now anticipates creditors will receive only 30% ofwhat they are owed.   The trustee's previous disclosure estimated a 38%recovery. Much earlier in the bankruptcy case, Mr. Musselmanhad expressed hope that he could collect enough of the firm'sdebts to pay creditors 80 cents on the dollar.   Collecting the firm's debt proved unexpectedly difficultfor Mr. Musselman, in part because many clients of thedefunct law firm disputed the bills they had received fromFinley Kumble and refused to pay all or part of the tab.   Finley Kumble, once the nation's fourth-largest law firmwith 700 attorneys, collapsed in October 1987 under theweight of heavy debts and clashing egos. Three months later,it was pushed into Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings byfour banks to which the firm owed $83 million. The firm'stotal debt, not counting malpractice claims, amounted toabout $120 million.   To help cover a portion of the claims, Mr. Musselman wonagreement from the firm's top partners to pay millions ofdollars into a $41 million fund for creditors.   Steven J. Kumble and Marshall Manley will pay $4.5 millioneach; Andrew Heine, $2.5 million; Harvey Myerson, $1.3million; and Robert Washington Jr. and Neil Underberg, $1.15million each.</TEXT></DOC>
