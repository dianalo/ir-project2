On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for currentdelivery rose to $413.70 a troy ounce from $413.20 last Friday.   Dealers said trading activity was reduced due to the MartinLuther King Day holiday in the United States and a national holidayin Japan, both of which closed banks _ the biggest players in theworld foreign-exchange market.   Most New York banks limited their activity to executing a feworders for corporate customers, and there was no clear trend to thedollar's movements, said Charles Annunziato, a trader atPrudential-Bache Securities Inc.   ``It's such a thin market, maybe it's not a reliable guide,''said the chief corporate dealer at a Swiss bank in London, whoasked not to be named.   Dealers in Europe said the dollar's rise was fueled by aweakening of the West German mark against the Japanese yen andagainst the British pound.   The mark was pushed lower by an initial drop in Frankfurt, WestGermany, share prices which was sharper than many traders hadexpected following Friday's fall on Wall Street. The mark hasderived support in recent months from foreign investor interest inWest German shares.
