In fact, D.K. Lowe had to pull up all 750 pounds of herdepartment-issued Kawasaki 1000 many times a day. The exercise isrequired of all Dallas motorcycle officers.   The 37-year-old policewoman, who stands 5-foot-4, said recentlythat there were many times, especially toward the end of the day,that the motorcycle seemed to weigh a ton and she wondered, ``Whatam I doing here?''   But she managed to pull up her bike each and every time duringher six weeks of training. Last week, she won the shoulder patchwith wings designating her a motorcycle officer.   She'll have to wait a bit for her boots, however.   Ms. Lowe was issued a pair of size-7, knee-high boots in blackleather, the smallest in stock, and has had to wear three pairs ofsocks to make them fit. Now that she's passed her training, thedepartment has ordered new boots.   ``I'm lucky,'' said Ms. Lowe. ``The balls of my feet do touchthe ground. Well, at least one of them.''   Despite motorcycle officers' tough image, Ms. Lowe said sheplans to add a dash of femininity.   ``My motto is: I don't put that helmet on without putting mylipstick on,'' she said.</TEXT><DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Patrick McLynn has the perfect Christmasgift suggestion for the person who has everything, including a carthat works: a Batmobile that doesn't.   It won't be cheap. The college student, who won the ``Batman''movie car and $25,000 in an MTV contest, is hoping to get $125,000to $330,000 for the sleek, black car and is seeking sealed bidsfrom around the world. The deadline: Dec. 20.   ``My accountant thinks it's going to be more lucrative if we tryfor somebody in California,'' he said. ``Somebody who's going towant to sit on this thing for an investment or just for laughs andhas that kind of money ...''   The Batmobile, a prototype that was one of three cars built for``Batman,'' has another drawback. It doesn't have a working engine.   McLynn already has received two bids from Hollywood ProductionsInc., which built the Batmobiles.   The company initially offered $4,000, then upped that to $25,000or a brand-new Corvette _ with an engine. McLynn's main form oftransportation is a motorcyle.   Estimates of what it cost Hollywood Productions to build thevehicle range from $16,000 to $60,000.   McLynn's uncle, Andy Grimes, has been handling most of theinquiries about the Batmobile.   ``We're now in the process of weeding out the people who bidjust to get a hand in it so they can tell people they had a shot atthe Batmobile,'' Grimes said.</TEXT></DOC>
