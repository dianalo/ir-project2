The medical criteria for evaluatingmental disorders in children are found in 112.00 of Part B of the Listingof Impairments in Appendix 1 of Subpart P of Part 404 of title 20 of theCode of Federal Regulations (CFR). Appendix 1 is divided into Part A andPart B. The criteria in Part A apply mainly to evaluating impairments ofadults, but may be applied in evaluating impairments in children underage 18 if the disease process has a similar effect on adults and children.Part B of Appendix 1 contains medical criteria for the evaluation of impairmentsof children under age 18, where the criteria in Part A do not give appropriateconsideration to the particular disease process in childhood. Part B wasinitially included only in Appendix 1 of Subpart I of Part 416 in 1977,subsequent to the enactment of the Supplemental Security Income Program.While Part B applies mainly to claims by children for Supplemental SecurityIncome benefits based on disability under title XVI, it also applies tosome claims for disability insurance benefits under title II. In recodifyingthe title II and title XVI disability regulations on August 20, 1980 (45FR 55566), we took the medical criteria used in making disability determinationsout of Part 416 and placed them only in Appendix 1 of Subpart P of Part404. This was done to eliminate repetition in the regulations, since themedical criteria contained in Appendix 1 to apply to both the title IIand title XVI disability programs. (See 20 CFR 404.1525 and 416.925.)The proposed revisions serve several purposes. The medical terms used todescribe the major mental disorders of childhood and their characteristicsand symptoms have been updated to conform to the nomenclature currentlyused widely by psychiatrists, psychologists, and other mental health professionals.Terminology in the listings is based on that used in the third editionof the <T3>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</T3> (DSM III)published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in 1980. This editiongives a common basis for communication, which is particularly importantin evaluating medical reports used in determining disability. The DSM III-Revised,which was published in May 1987 and after these evaluation criteria weredeveloped, does not differ in its applicable terminology.The proposed listings are also more specifically related to distinct typesof mental disorders. Thus, fewer disorders are included under the samelisting than are grouped together under the current listings. The resultis an increase in the number of listings from four to nine. In the proposedlistings, the organization of mental disorders is based on the DSM IIIwhich provides a realistic organization in terms of the common characteristicsof the mental disorders that are evaluated under a particular listing.The more recently published DSM III-Revised does not differ in its organization.Since the body of knowledge on the characteristics, treatment and managementof mental disorders in children is constantly evolving, the Social SecurityAdministration (SSA) will provide for the ongoing evaluation of the medicalcriteria for evaluating mental disorders in children to ensure that thecriteria reflect the most up-to-date knowledge on those disorders.The evaluation of mental disorders in children will not require the useof the Psychiatric Review Technique Form (PRTF), as is currently requiredfor the evaluation of adult disorders. The PRTF was designed to assistadjudicators through the sequential evaluation process in adult claimsinvolving mental disorders, which can include assessment of the residualfunctional capacity. Since evaluation of title XVI disabled child casesand some title II cases involves only a consideration as to whether theclaimant is actually engaged in substantial gainful activity or has animpairment which meets or equals a listed impairment and does not considerwhether the claimant has the ability to work, utilization of the PRTF inthese cases would be unnecessary and inappropriate. Therefore, we are alsoproposing amendment to andSection;andSection; 404.1520a and 416.920a to reflectthat the PRTF will only be required in evaluating the severity of mentalimpairments in adults age 18 and over and in children under age 18 wherethe disease process has a similar effect on adults and younger persons.The following is a summary of the proposed listings.  112.00 Preface  We are proposing several significant additions to the preface to the mentaldisorders listings for children under age 18. Proposed Introduction, 112.00Aof the preface explains the basic approach used in the listings that follow.It explains that most the listings use a new dual approach which divideseach listing into two paragraphs: the first paragraph (the A paragraph)describes the characteristics necessary to substantiate the existence ofthe mental disorder, while the second paragraph (the B paragraph) describesthe applicable restrictions and functional limitations which result fromthe disorder in children.  In 112.00B of the preface, Need for Medical Evidence, we describe the needfor medical evidence to substantial the existence of a medically determinableimpairment.  In 112.00C of the preface, Assessment of Severity, we describe in detailthe multiple factors in the paragraph B criteria of most listings whichpertain to functional limitations and restrictions in various age groupsin children. This significant revision in the mental disorders listingshas been introduced because mental health professionals consider such factorsparticularly important in evaluating mental disorders of children. It shouldbe noted that although the items in paragraph B are identical for mostlistings, the number of items required varies for particular listings. In 112.00D of the preface, Documentation, we discuss the evidence neededto document mental disorders in children.  In 112.00E, Effect of Hospitalization of Residential Placement, and 112.00F,Effects of Medication, we also include new information relating to mentaldisorders in children. This material explains that evaluation of mentaldisorders must include consideration of the fact that medications, hospitalizations,or other highly structured living arrangements may minimize the overt indicationsof severe chronic mental disorders without necessarily affecting the functionallimitations imposed by the disorder. The proposed 112.00F also acknowledgesthat medications may sometimes produce side effects that add to the functionallimitations resulting from mental disorders in children.   112.01 Category of Impairments_Mental  112.02 Organic Mental Disorders Paragraph A of proposed listing 112.02 contains nine characteristics ofthese disorders. Proposed paragraph B contains the restrictions or functionallimitations used to assess the severity to these disorders.  Mental disorders do not manifest themselves in the same way in childrenof different ages. Therefore, the proposed paragraph B criteria providefor the assessment of impairment severity for two age groups_age 1 to attainmentof age 3 and age 3 to attainment of age 18.  The criteria used to assess impairment severity in the age group of 1 toattainment of age 3 are based upon functional deficits in the followingareas: gross and fine motor development, cognitive-communicative function,and social functioning. The criteria in the age group of 3 to attainmentof age 18 use functional deficits in the following areas to assess impairmentseverity: Cognitive/communicative function; social functioning; personal/behavioralfunction; and concentration, persistence and pace. To fulfill the requirementsof listing 112.02 for either age grouping, it must be demonstrated thatthe child has functional deficits or restrictions in one of the areas tothe degree specified in the paragraph B criteria.  112.03 Psychotic Disorders  The proposed listing groups psychotic conditions that are more closelyrelated than in the current listing. Affective disorders are to be evaluatedunder proposed listing 112.04. Paragraph A has been revised and the proposedparagraph B has been introduced as discussed in listing 112.02.  112.04 Affective Disorders  In the current organization of the mental disorders listings, affectivedisorders are evaluated under listing 112.03 (Psychoses of Infancy andChildhood) or listing 112.04 (Functional Nonpsychotic Disorders). The newlisting which we are proposing now relates exclusively to affective disorders.In paragraph A of the proposed listing, we describe the characteristicsof affective disorders in more detail than they are described in the currentlistings 112.03 and 112.04. We are introducing paragraph B in the mannerpreviously described for proposed listing 112.02.   112.05 Mental Retardation  Listing 112.05 essentially remains the same with the addition of a fourthcriterion. This new criterion, proposed paragraph D, provides for separateassessment of children with an IQ of 60-69 without any coexisting physicalor mental impairment but who experience either marked impairment in socialfunctioning or marked impairment in personal/behavioral function.   112.06 Anxiety-Related Disorders  In the organization of the current listings, anxiety-related disordersare grouped with similar mental disorders in a single listing (112.04).Proposed listing 112.06 exclusively covers disorders related to anxiety.Items 3, 4 and 6 in paragraph A of this proposed listing are similar toitems covered in the current listing. Four additional items have been addedto better identify various characteristics of these disorders. Proposedparagraph B has been introduced as discussed in proposed listing 112.02,but three of the requirements listed in paragraph B must be satisfied forthe listing requirements to be fulfilled in listing 112.06.112.07 Disorders with Physical ManifestationsThese disorders are currently evaluated with other nonpsychotic disordersunder listing 112.04. This proposed listing relates specifically to nonpsychoticdisorders with physical manifestations. Proposed paragraph A adds moredetailed characteristic patterns of these disorders to the two now in paragraphsA and E of the current listing 112.04. Proposed paragraph B has been addedin the manner previously discussed for proposed 112.02, but three of therequirements listed in paragraph B must be satisfied for the listing requirementsto be fulfilled in listing 112.07.112.08 Personality DisordersThese disorders are currently evaluated under listing 112.04. The proposedlisting is a reference listing which refers the evaluator to listing 12.08of the adult mental disorders listings in part A of the Listing of Impairments.Since personality disorders do not usually manifest themselves until laterchildhood, the adult mental disorder listing is a more appropriate indicatorof disability.112.09 Autism and Other Pervasive Developmental DisordersThese disorders currently are evaluated under listings 112.02, 112.03,or 112.05 based on the individual case factors. In the proposed listing,paragraph A describes the characteristics of autism or other pervasivedevelopmental disorders. Proposed paragraph B has been added in the mannerpreviously discussed for proposed listing 112.02.Autism in children is well recognized as a specific, discrete mental disorderand presents its manifestations differently from that which is found inadults. Therefore, a separate listing for children is being proposed.112.10 Developmental and Emotional Disorders of Infancy (birth to attainmentof age 1)The developmental and emotional evaluation of infants requires specialconsideration; therefore, a new listing is proposed which more accuratelyevaluates functional loss in all infants of this age group. The proposedlisting is divided into four paragraphs which describe specific criteriawhich are indicative of severe functional loss in infants.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Changes</ITAG>We are also proposing a technical amendment to listing 12.05D, in PartA of Appendix 1 (adult listings), pertaining to the evaluation of mentalretardation and autism in order to clarify that either disorder requirestwo of the functional limitations to satisfy the listing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The additional program costs for title XVI will be as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>7,L2,tp0,i1,s50,10,10,10,10,10,10</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Fiscal years</H1><H2>1989</H2><H2>1990</H2><H2>1991</H2><H2>1992</H2><H2>1993</H2><H1>Total</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Program cost ($ in millions)<D>$4</D><D>$10</D><D>$16</D><D>$22</D><D>$27</D><D>$79</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Admin.

The listings for mental disorders in children arearranged in 9 diagnostic categories: Organic mental disorders (112.02);psychotic disorders (112.03); affective disorders (112.04); mental retardation(112.05); anxiety-related disorders (112.06); disorders with physical manifestation(112.07); personality disorders (112.08); autism and other pervasive developmentaldisorders (112.09); and developmental and emotional disorders of infancy(112.10).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There are significant differences between the listings for adultsand the listings for children. There are disorders found in children thathave no real analogy in adults, hence the differences in the diagnosticcategories for children. The presentation of mental disorders in children,particularly the very young child, may be subtle and of a character differentfrom the signs and symptoms found in adults. For example, a finding suchas an infant's failure to mold or bond with the parent(s) has grave prognosticimplications and serves as a finding comparable in severity to the findingsthat mark mental disorders in adults.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The activities appropriate to children such as learning, growing,playing, maturing, and school adjustment are also different from the activitiesappropriate to the adult and vary widely in the different childhood stages.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Each listing begins with an introductory statement that describesthe syndrome or syndromes addressed by the listing. This is followed (exceptin listings 112.05, 112.08 and 112.10) by clinical findings (paragraphA criteria), which, if satisfied, lead to an assessment of functional limitations(paragraph B criteria). An individual will be found to have a listed impairmentwhen the criteria of both paragraphs A and B of the listed impairment aresatisfied.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The purpose of the criteria in paragraph A is to substantiate medicallythe presence of a particular mental disorder. Specific signs and symptomsunder any of the listings 112.02 through 112.10 cannot be considered inisolation from the description of the mental disorder contained at thebeginning of each listing category. Impairments should be analyzed or reviewedunder the mental category(ies) indicated by the clinical findings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Paragraph A of the listings is a composite of clinical findings whichare used to substantiate the existence of a disorder and may or may notbe appropriate for children at specific developmental stages. However,a range of clinical findings is included in the listings so that no agegroup is excluded. For example, in listing 112.02A7, emotional labilityand crying would be inappropriate criteria to apply to infants and youngchildren; whereas in 112.02A1, developmental arrest, delay or regression,are appropriate criteria for infants and young children. Whenever the adjudicatordecides that the requirements of paragraph A of a particular mental listingare satisfied, then that listing should be applied regardless of the ageof the child to be evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The purpose of the paragraph B criteria is to describe functionallimitations which are applicable to children. Standardized tests of socialor cognitive function and adaptive behavior are frequently available andappropriate for the evaluation of children and, thus, such tests are includedin the paragraph B functional parameters. The functional restrictions inparagraph B must be the result of the mental disorder which is manifestedby the clinical findings in paragraph A.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We have not included separate C criteria for listings 112.03 and 112.06as are found in the adult listings because, for the most part, we do notbelieve that categories like residual schizophrenia or agoraphobia arecommonly found in children. However, in individual cases where these disordersare found in children and are comparable to the severity and duration foundin adults, the adult 12.03C and 12.06C critiera may be used for evaluationof the cases.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The structure of the listings for Mental Retardation (112.05), PersonalityDisorders (112.08) and Developmental and Emotional Disorders of Infancy(112.10) is different from that of the other mental disorders. Listing112.05 (Mental Retardation) contains four criteria, any one of which, ifsatisfied, will result in a finding that the child's impairment meets thelisting. Listing 112.08 (Personality Disorders) is a reference listingreferring the evaluator to listing 12.08 of the adult listings. Listing112.10 (Developmental and Emotional Disorders of Infancy) contains fourcriteria, any one of which, if satisfied, will result in a finding thatthe infant's impairment meets the listing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. <T3>Need for Medical Evidence: </T3>The existence of a medically determinableimpairment of the required duration must be established by medical evidenceconsisting of signs, symptoms and/or laboratory, psychological or developmentaltest findings. Psychiatric signs are medically demonstrable phenomena whichindicate specific abnormalities of behavior, affect, thought, memory, orientation,development and contact with reality as described by an appropriate medicalsource. Symptoms are complaints presented by the child. Signs and symptomsgenerally cluster together to constitute recognizable clinical syndromes(mental disorders) described in paragraph A of the listings. These findingsmay be intermittent or continuous depending on the nature of the disorder.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. <T3>Assessment of Severity: </T3>In childhood cases, as with adults, severityis measured according to the functional limitations imposed by the medicallydeterminable mental impairment. However, the range of functions used toassess impairment severity for children varies at different stages of maturation.The criteria address age-appropriate functional limitations for each agegroup in some or all of the following areas: motor function, cognitive/communicativefunction, social function and personal/behavioral function. In most functionalareas two separate methods of documenting the required level of severityare: use of standardized tests (where appropriate test instruments areavailable) and use of clinical findings. The use of standardized testsis the preferred method of documentation if such tests are available.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Newborn and young infants (birth to attainment of age 1) have notdeveloped sufficient personality differentiation to permit formulationof appropriate diagnoses. We have, therefore, assigned listing 112.10 forDevelopmental and Emotional Disorders of Infancy for the evaulation ofmental disorders of such children. Severity of these disorders is basedon measures of development in motor, cognitive/communicative and socialfunctions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In defining the severity of functional limitations, two differentsets of paragraph B criteria corresponding to two separate age groupingshave been established, in addition to the individual infant listing 112.10.These age groupings are: infants and toddlers (age 1 to attainment of age3) and children (age 3 to attainment of age 18). However, the followingdiscussion on the age-appropriate areas of function is broken down intofour age groupings, i.e., infants and toddlers (age 1 to attainment ofage 3), preschool children (age 3 to attainment of age 6), primary schoolchildren (age 6 to attainment of age 12) and adolescents (age 12 to attainmentof age 18). This was done to better explain the age group variances indisease manifestations and methods of evaluation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Infants and toddlers (age 1 to attainment of age 3)</T3>. In this agegroup, impairment severity is assessed in three areas: motor development,cognitive/communicative function, and social function. In infancy, muchof what we can discern about mental function comes from observation ofthe degree of fine and gross motor function. Developmental delay as measuredby a good developmental milestone history confirmed by medical examinationis critical. If the delay is such that the infant or toddler has not achievedmotor development generally acquired by children no more than one-halfthe child's chronological age, the criteria are satisfied.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Cognitive/communicative function is measured using one of severalstandardized infant scales. Appropriate tests for the measure of such functionare discussed in 112.00D; care should be taken to avoid reliance on screeningdevices, which are not considered to be sufficiently reliable instruments,although such devices may provide some relevant data.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For infants and toddlers, alternative criteria covering disruptionin communication as measured by their capacity to use simple verbal andnonverbal structures to communicate basic needs is provided.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Social function in infants and toddlers is measured in terms of thedevelopment of relatedness (i.e., bonding, stranger anxiety, etc.) andattachment to animate or inanimate objects. Criteria are provided thatuse standard social maturity scales or alternative criteria that describemarked impairment in socialization in terms of separation anxiety, withdrawaland failure to develop appropriate response to external stimuli.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Prescrhool children (age 3 to attainment of age 6). </T3>For the agegroups including preschool children through adolescents, the functionalareas used to measure severity are: cognitive/communicative function, socialfunction, and personal/behavioral function. After 36 months, motor functionis no longer felt to be a primary determinant of mental function, although,of course, any motor abnormalities should be documented and evaluated.In the preschool years and beyond, cognitive function can be measured bystandardized tests of intelligence although the appropriate instrumentmay vary with age. A primary criterion for limited cognitive function isa valid verbal, performance, or full scale I.Q. of 69 or less. The listingsalso provide alternative criteria consisting of tests of language developmentof bizarre speech patterns.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Social function is measured by relationships with parents, other adults,and peers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Personal/behavioral function may be measured by a standardized testof adaptive behavior or by careful description of serious maladaptive oravoidant behaviors. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Primary school children (age 6 to attainment of age 12).</T3> The measuresof function here are similar to those for preschool-age children exceptthat the test instruments may change and the capacity to function in theschool setting supplements information in the cognitive and social parameters.Scores which are at least two standard deviations below the age-appropriatenorm on standardized measures of academic achievement represent a markedimpairment in function. As described in 112.00D, Documentation, schoolrecords are an excellent source of information concerning function andstandardized testing and should always be sought for school-age children.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Adolescents (age 12 to attainment of age 18). </T3>Functional criteriaparallel to those for primary school children are provided for this agegroup. It should be remembered, however, that mental disorders in adolescencemay more closely resemble those of adults than children. Therefore, if,based on the description of the disorder by the clinician, the adjudicatorbelieves the medical criteria of Part B do not apply, the adult listingcriteia will be used. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Again, the same three general areas of function as in the primaryschool group (cognitive/communicative, social, and personal/behavioral)are measures of severity for this age group. Testing instruments appropriateto adolescents should be used. Comparable clinical findings of disruptionof social function must consider the capacity to form appropriate, stableand lasting relationships. If information is available about cooperativeworking relationships in school or at part or full-time work, or aboutthe ability to work as a member of a group, it should be considered whenassessing the child's social and/or personal/behavioral functioning. Markedlyimpoverished social contact, isolation, withdrawal, or inappropriate orbizarre behavior under the stress of socializing with others also constitutescomparable clinical findings. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The intent of the functional criterion described in paragraph B2dcommon to the listings, i.e., deficiencies of concentration, persistenceor pace resulting in failure to complete work-like tasks in a timely manneris to identify the school-age child age 6 to attainment of age 18 who cannotadequately function in school because of a mental impairment. Althoughgrades and the need for special education placement are relevant factorswhich must be considered in reaching a decision under paragraph B2d, theyare not conclusive. There is too much variability from school districtto school district in the expected level of grading and in the criteriafor special education placement to justify reliance solely on these factors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Where ``marked'' is used as a standard measuring the degree of limitation,except as defined in 112.00C3, it means more than moderate but less thanextreme. A marked limitation may arise when several activities or functionsare impaired or even when only one is impaired, as long as the degree oflimitation is such as to interfere seriously with the ability to functionindependently, appropriately, and effectively. When standardized testsare used as the measure of functional parameters, a valid score that istwo standard deviations below the norm for the test will be considereda marked restriction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">D. <T3>Documentation:</T3> The presence of a mental disorder in a child mustbe documented on the basis of reports from acceptable sources of medicalinformation. See andSection;andSection; 404.1513 and 416.913. Description offunctional limitations may be available from these sources and may be supplementedby reports from parents or other concerned adults who aware of the child'sactivities of daily living, social functioning, and ability to adapt todifferent settings and expectations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For very young infants, it may be very difficult to document the presenceor severity of a mental disorder. Therefore, with the exception of somegenetic diseases and catastrophic congenital anomalies, it may be necessarythat some cases be held until the child attains 3 months of age in orderto obtain adequate observation of behavior or emotional affect. This periodwould be extended in cases of premature infants proportionately to thedegree of prematurity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For very young infants and toddlers, programs of early interventioninvolving occupational, physical and speech therapists, nurses, socialworkers, and special educators, are a rich source of data. They can providethe developmental milestone evaluations and records on the fine and grossmotor functioning of an infant. This information is valuable and can complementthe medical examination by a physician. The report of an interdisciplinaryteam which contains the evaluation and signature of an acceptable medicalsource can be considered acceptable medical evidence rather than supplementaldata.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In children with mental disorders, particularly those requiring specialplacement, school records are a rich source of data, and the required reevaluationsat specified time periods can provide the longitudinal data needed to traceimpairment progression over time. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In some cases where the treating source(s) lack expertise in dealingwith mental disorders of children, it may be necessary to obtain evidencefrom a psychiatrist or psychologist with experience and skill in the diagnosisand treatment of mental disorders as they appear in children. In thesecases, however, every effort should be made to obtain the records of treatingsources, since these records will help establish a longitudinal picturethat cannot be established through a single purchased examination. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For purposes of these childhood mental disorders listings, standardizedpsychological testing indicates the use of a psychological test that hasappropriate characteristics of validity, reliability, and norms, administeredindividually by a psychologist or psychiatrist qualified by training andexperience to perform such an evaluation. Psychological tests are bestconsidered as a set of tasks or questions designed to elicit particularbehaviors when presented in a standardized manner.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The salient characteristics of a good test are: 1) validity, i.e.,the test measures what it is supposed to measure, as determined by appropriatemethods; 2). reliability, i.e., the consistency of results obtained overtime with the same test and the same individual; and 3) appropriate normativedata, i.e., individual test scores must be comparable to test data fromother individuals or groups of a similar nature, representative of thatpopulation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Identical IQ scores obtained from different tests do not always reflecta similar degree of intellectual functioning. In this connection, it mustbe noted that on the WISC-R, for example, IQ's of 69 and below are characteristicof approximately the lowest 2 percent of the general population. In instanceswhere other tests are administered, it would be necessary to convert theIQ score(s) to the corresponding percentile rank in the general populationin order to determine the actual degree of impairment reflected by theIQ score(s). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In cases where more than one IQ is customarily derived from the testadministered, i.e., where verbal, performance, and full-scale IQ's areprovided as on the WISC-R, the lowest of these is used in conjunction withlisting 112.05. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Tests meeting the above requirements are acceptable and encouragedfor the determination of the conditions contained in the childhood mentaldisorders included in the listings. The psychiatrist or psychologist administeringthe test must have a sound technical and professional understanding ofthe tests and be able to evaluate the research documentation related tothe intended application of the test. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In conjunction with clinical examinations, sources may report theresults of screening tests, i.e., tests used for gross determination levelof functioning. These tests do not have high validity and reliability andare not considered appropriate primary evidence for disability determinations.These screening instruments may be useful in uncovering potentially severeimpairments, but must be supplemented by the use of formal, standardizedpsychological testing for the purposes of a final disability determinationwhere such tests are required and available. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Where reference is made to developmental milestones, this is definedas the achievement of a particular mental or motor skill at an age-appropriatelevel, i.e., the skills achieved by an infant or young child sequentiallyand within a given time period in the motor and manipulative areas; ingeneral understanding and social behavior; in self-feeding, dressing, andtoilet training; and in language. This is sometimes expressed as a developmentalquotient (DQ), or the relation between developmental age and chronologicalage as determined by specific standardized measurements and observations.Such tests include, but are not limited to, the Cattell Infant IntelligenceScale, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, the Gesell DevelopmentalScreening Test, and the Revised Stanford-Binet. Formal tests of the achievementof developmental milestones are generally used in the clinical settingfor determination of the developmental status of infants and toddlers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Formal psychological tests of cognitive achievement are generallyin use for preschool children, for primary school children, and for adolescentsexcept for those instances noted below. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Exceptions to formal standardized psychological testing, when required,may be considered when a psychologist or psychiatrist who is qualifiedby training and experience to perform such an evaluation is not readilyavailable. In such instances, appropriate historical, social, medical andother information must be reviewed in arriving at a determination. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Exceptions may also be considered in the case of ethnic/cultural minoritieswhere the native language or culture is not principally English-speaking.In such instances, psychological tests which are culture-free, such asthe Leiter International Performance Scale or the Scale of Multi-CulturePluralistic Assessment (SOMPA) may be substituted for the preceding standardizedtests. Any required tests must be administered in the child's principallanguage. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``Neuropsychological testing'' refers to the administration of standardizedtests which are reliable and valid with respect to assessing impairmentin brain functioning. It is intended that the psychologist or psychiatristusing these tests will be able to evaluate the following functions: attention/concentration,problem solving, language, memory, motor, visual-motor and visual-perceptual,laterality and general intelligence (if not previously obtained). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">E. <T3>Effect of Hospitalization or Residential Placement:</T3> As with adults,children with mental disorders may be placed in a variety of structuredsettings outside the home as part of their treatment. Such settings include,but are not limited to, psychiatric hospitals, developmental disabilitiesfacilities, residential treatment centers and schools, community-basedgroup homes and workshop facilities. The reduced mental demands of suchstructured settings may attenuate overt symptomatology and superficiallymake the child's level of adaptive functioning appear better than it is.Therefore, the capacity of the child to function outside highly structuredsettings must be considered in evaluating impairment severity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On the other hand, there may be a variety of causes for placementof a child in a structured setting which may or may not be directly relatedto impairment severity and functionable ability. Placement in a structuredsetting in and of itself does not equate with a finding of disability.The severity of the impairment must be compared with the requirements ofthe appropriate listing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">F. <T3>Effects of Medication: </T3>Attention must be given to the effect ofmedication on the child's signs, symptoms and ability to function. Whilepsychoactive medications may control certain primary manifestations ofmental disorder, e.g., hallucinations, impaired attention, restlessnessor hyperactivity, such treatment may or may not affect the functional limitationsimposed by the mental disorder. In cases where overt symptomatology isattenuated by the psychoactive medications, particular attention must befocused on the functional limitations which may persist. These functionallimitations must be considered in assessing impairment severity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Psychotropic medicines used in the treatment of some mental illnessesmay cause drowsiness, blunted affect, or other side effects involving otherbody systems. Such side effects must be considered in evaluating overallimpairment severity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">112.01 Category of Impairments, Mental </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>112.02  Organic Mental Disorders: </T3>Psychological or behavioralabnormalities associated with a dysfunction of the brain.
