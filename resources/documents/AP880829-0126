MILLS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Using Medicaid computer data to identifypharmacies selling unusual amounts of controlled substances couldhelp investigators in the battle against illicit drugs, accordingto a congressional report.   ``It's an astoundingly simple concept, despite the complexity ofthe computer system,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., whoreleased the General Accounting Office study late Monday. ``Locatethe drugstores selling the highest percentage of controlledsubstances to Medicaid `patients' and you might also be finding thecrooked drugstores and the doctors purposely making illegalprescriptions.''   Aside from drugs, such as heroin, which are unlawful under anycircumstances, controlled substances include many other drugs whichbe legally prescribed but pose various risks of physical orpsychological harm through abuse. Morphine, methadone, cocaine,aspirin with codeine, phenobarbital, Valium and Darvon are amongexamples.   Except in small states, Medicaid agencies are required to have aMedicaid Management Information System which contains data onrecipients, physicians and pharmacies, according to the GAO report.Accounting Office. While separate statistics aren't collected oncontrolled drug transactions, GAO found that ``data contained inthe MMIS's can be manipulated to produce reports that may be usefulin the identification of providers who may be diverting controlledsubstances.''   The GAO said MMIS data could be helpful in spotting controlledsubstance prescription abuses within the Medicaid program throughcloser analysis of the data and sharing the information with lawenforcement agencies.   For example, GAO auditors analyzed all pharmacies in New Yorkwhere 20 percent or more of their Medicaid claims in 1986 involvedcontrolled substances. They found 11 drugstores that weresubstantially above statewide average for business involvingcontrolled substances. Of those, seven were disqualified fromMedicaid in 1987.   The GAO was careful to note, however, the a higher-than-averagelevel of controlled substance sales is not necessarily an abuse ofthe program.   The report recommended that the Health and Human Servicessecretary, in consultation with the Department of Justice, test theusefulness and cost of analyzing and providing MMIS controlledsubstances data to law enforcement, regulatory and licensingagencies.   Rangel, who is chairman of the House Select Committee onNarcotics Abuse and Control, said he would hold a hearing early inthe next Congress on the feasibility of nationwide use of MMIS datato spot controlled substance abuses.</TEXT></DOC>
