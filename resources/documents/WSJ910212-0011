Playing up his dark glasses and slicked-backhair, some draw the labor boss as a sinister gangster. Otherartists emphasize Mr. Velazquez's baggy suits and cigar tosketch him as a grandfatherly vaudevillian.   The question of whether Mr. Velazquez is sinister or notis one question in the complex negotiations over a free tradeagreement between the U.S. and Mexico.</LP><TEXT>   The biggest opposition to the pact is coming from U.S.unions. They say free trade could depress U.S. wages and sendjobs fleeing to Mexico, where businesses often benefit fromrepression, corruption and lax work standards linked to Mr.Velazquez's government -- loyal labor umbrella group, theConfederation of Mexican Workers. &quot;Fidel Velazquez is the AlCapone of Mexico's labor relations,&quot; says Daniel La Botz, ananalyst for a U.S. worker rights group that has assailed thefree-trade push.   U.S. proponents of free trade -- big business andadministration officials concerned about keeping a stableMexico -- emphasize the role of Mr. Velazquez's organizationin maintaining tranquility during Mexico's debilitating debtcrisis. &quot;It's very easy to look at this in simplistic termsand say this is wrong,&quot; says Nicholas Scheele, director ofFord Motor Co. in Mexico. &quot;But is there any other country inthe world where the working class . . . took a hit in theirpurchasing power of in excess of 50% over an eight-yearperiod and you didn't have social revolution?&quot;   As head of a vast labor network that doubles as the lastredoubt of an increasingly unpopular ruling political party,Mr. Velazquez stands at the crossroads where economic reformand political reform converge. On one hand, the governmentneeds tight control of labor to buy time for its marketoriented-economic reforms to flourish. On the other hand, itneeds to dismantle the labor apparatus to make Mexico moredemocratic.   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has been quite clearabout which of the two reform projects he considers moreurgent. &quot;We established economic reform as the priority, andto be able to realize it, we have used mechanisms of thepolitical system that permit this dialogue and thisconsensus-building,&quot; President Salinas said in an interview.&quot;I think the least convenient thing is to try to doeverything at the same time, because the result can be zero.&quot;   Mr. Salinas took another incremental step toward politicalopening yesterday when he met with populist Sen. PorfirioMunoz Ledo in what analysts called Mr. Salinas's first publicencounter with a top leader of the leftist opposition sincehe took Mexico's highest office amid charges of electoralfraud in 1988.   Of Mr. Velazquez, the president says: &quot;He's a labor leaderwith whom it's possible to converse and to reach anagreement, and he has the ability to fulfill it. Thus, heplays a very important role in the process of economicstabilization.&quot;   Mexico's ruling elite feels its choice of priorities hasbeen vindicated by the growing economic chaos, not to mentionthe rollback in political freedoms, that's occurring in theSoviet Union. They say Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev had itbackwards when he placed a full-bore political overhaulbefore a relatively limited economic overhaul.   &quot;Politically, if it's possible to have an evolution ratherthan a revolution, it's much more effective and better forall,&quot; says Alberto Santos, a leading industrialist, who hasserved as a ruling party congressman. &quot;Fidel Velazquez hasbeen a very important factor in political stability duringeconomic changes.&quot;   Mr. Velazquez has always displayed at least as muchsympathy for the government as for the rank and file. Butduring Mexico's debt crisis, he has looked the other waywhile workers endured hardship unmatched since the GreatDepression. The number of strikes has dwindled as a result ofgovernment intimidation tactics, including the use of thearmy against recalcitrant unions. Mr. Velazquez forborepushing for an immediate recuperation of purchasing power andsigned onto the government anti-inflation program.   One incentive for labor officials who keep the rank andfile in line is the well-refined system of graft, a systemthat even offends some businessmen who benefit from tameunions. The union system &quot;has its good points,&quot; says FernandoCanales, a steel executive and member of the conservativeopposition, &quot;but in my opinion, the corruption has beencarried to excess.&quot; He cites the case of a local union bosswho has amassed a real estate empire.   Whatever the excesses of his subordinates, Mr. Velazquez'sown style is spartan. The former milkman arrives atbargaining sessions without the retinue that accompanies mostofficials. At the negotiating table, he doesn't take notesbut never forgets a detail, say those who have dealt withhim. &quot;He has a razor-sharp mind,&quot; says Ford's Mr. Scheele.   But for Mexican workers, the results of Mr. Velazquez'sloyalty to the government have been mixed. A leading businesschamber this week said that some 77,000 businesses, employinghundreds of thousands of workers, had closed since thegovernment began tearing down trade barriers and opening theeconomy to foreign competition in 1986.   On the other hand, workers have benefited from the growthMexico has recorded in each of the last two years. And aprogram that cut inflation to 29% last year from 170% in 1987&quot;has helped bring an important recuperation in purchasingpower,&quot; says Jorge Vazquez Costilla, an economist at GrupoVisa, a conglomerate. He points out that some workers inservice industries now earn as much as they did before thedebt crisis, and that most manufacturers must now pay doublethe minimum wage to attract help.   The government is banking on free trade as the last stepto recovery. But to even start talks, Mexico must overcomecriticism of its political system, especially of the leaderknown as Don Fidel. &quot;It's an odd irony,&quot; says a diplomathere. &quot;This old man who was the government's greatest allyfor a decade may in this case be one of its greatestliabilities.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
