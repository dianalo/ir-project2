Before thisstatement is finalized, the two Departments will carefully consider anycomments that are received. In developing this statement, the Departmentstook into account the views of a variety of parties including air carriers,freight forwarders, airport operators, cities, shippers and other governmentagencies. The House Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight of theCommittee on Public Works and Transportation has shown particular interestin the development of this statement. The Subcommittee, chaired by CongressmanJames Oberstar, has held several hearings on this subject. The statementalso reflects the findings and conclusions of the in-depth study of theU.S. international air cargo market completed in April 1988 by the Departmentsof State and Transportation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Statement of U.S. International Air Cargo Policy</ITAG>In many respects, the air cargo industry is the most dynamic and fast-changingsector of air transportation. With an increasing percentage of U.S. exportsand imports moving by air, the economic importance of air cargo servicesis expanding rapidly. A competitive air cargo industry ensures the availabilityof efficient freight services to exporters and importers, stimulates newservice options and promotes trade. Competitive air cargo services alsoprovide a stimulus to airport development, regional economies, and employmentand make an important contribution to the national defense through industryparticipation in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program.The air cargo industry involves many participants engaged in a wide varietyof cargo activities. Combination carriers, all-cargo carriers, charterspecialists, firms providing door-to-door service, small package specialists,freight forwarders, airport operators, and shippers all play a role inthis industry.Air cargo services have specific qualities and requirements which are significantlydifferent from the passenger market. Unlike passengers, air cargo movesin one direction only. Speed is critical to competitive air cargo services.Nonetheless, cargo is less sensitive to the number of stops made enroute,to the circuitry of the routing or to changes in aircraft.Cargo is nonambulatory. Therefore, the movement and storage of air cargoon the ground is a necessary part of the air cargo business. With the growthof door-to-door service between the U.S. and other countries, the opportunityto establish sort centers and hubs, to operate or contract for pickup anddelivery services and to perform take-offs and landings during nighttimehours has become increasingly important.In order to develop an up-to-date information base and evaluate the aircargo industry's contribution to furthering broader U.S. economic objectives,the Departments of State and Transportation undertook a comprehensive studyof the international air cargo industry. The findings and conclusions ofthe Study were carefully considered in the course of developing this statement.The Federal Aviation ActU.S international air cargo policy is based on the principles and objectivescontained in sections 102(a), 102(b), 1102(b) and 1102(c) of the FederalAviation Act (Act), as amended by the International Air TransportationCompetition Act of 1979. (The texts of these sections are included as AppendixA to this statement.)Section 102(a) identifies a variety of ``Factors for Interstate, Overseas,and Foreign Air Transportation'' that are to be considered as being ``inthe public interest'' by U.S. authorities in carrying out the duties andresponsibilities mandated by the Act.Section 102(b) sets forth additional public interest factors aimed specificallyat all-cargo services. The provisions of this section include the encouragementand development of an all-cargo air service system ``responsive to (A)the present and future needs of shippers, (B) the commerce of the UnitedStates, and (C) the national defense * * *''.Section 1102(b), added by the International Air Transportation CompetitionAct of 1979, establishes specific ``Goals for International Aviation Policy''which the U.S. must pursue in the conduct of its aviation relations withforeign countries. These goals, some of which are similar to the publicinterest factors contained in section 102(a), identify ``a negotiatingpolicy which emphasizes the greatest degree of competition that is compatiblewith a well-functioning international air transportation system * * *''.Section 1102(c) requires that in developing and implementing internationalaviation negotiating policy, the Secretaries of State and Transportationconsult ``to the maximum extent practicable'' with interested parties includinggovernment agencies, airport operators, air carriers, airline labor andconsumer interest groups. Thus, the policy principles enunicated by the Federal Aviation Act identifybroad public interest considerations to be taken into account in the conductof U.S. international aviation affairs. These principles are designed toapply over a long period of time and to a wide variety of circumstances.Within this general framework, the statement of air cargo policy providesspecific policy objectives and guidelines. This statement also takes intoconsideration cargo airlift needs of the U.S. military as expressed inthe National Airlift Policy Statement. (See Appendix B of this statement.)Policy Objectives Consistent with the Federal Aviation Act, the findings of the InternationalAir Cargo Study, and broader U.S. economic and security interests, theprincipal aims of U.S. air cargo policy are to ensure the provision ofefficient, competitive air transport services for U.S. shippers and consigneesand to seek expansion of opportunities for the U.S. international air cargoindustry. An open, liberal operating environment serves this end by facilitatingthe establishment and expansion of efficient, innovative, competitive aircargo services. Accordingly, the United States seeks to achieve the following specificobjectives for all types of cargo services including scheduled and charterservices: <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Freedom of Carrier Entry </ITAG>The U.S. seeks unrestricted entry into international air cargo marketsfor all types of U.S. cargo operators, including direct air carriers andfreight forwarders. Elimination of restrictions on entry is critical ifthe shipping public is to enjoy fully the benefits of a competitive internationalaviation marketplace. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Routing Flexibility </ITAG>The U.S. seeks maximum international routing flexibility for U.S. carriersso that they can serve intermediate and beyond points freely and efficientlyutilize their hubs in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. also seeks broaderrights to change aircraft at any point on a route and to position aircraftin the most cost effective manner to serve markets that are directionallyimbalanced. Increased routing flexibility expands cargo opportunities,and in some cases may be critical to the viability of a cargo operation. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Pricing Freedom </ITAG>The U.S. seeks to establish regimes that permit airline management maximumflexibility in the setting of prices. Government intervention in air cargopricing should be limited to exceptional cases involving unfair and/ordiscriminatory practices. Pricing freedom for air cargo services promotesefficiency and cost competitiveness. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Elimination of Restrictions on Frequency and Capacity </ITAG>The U.S. seeks to eliminate governmental controls on U.S. carrier cargocapacity that restrict frequency of service, aircraft type, and/or theamount of cargo that may be carried. These restrictions impair carrierefficiency and adversely affect the availability to shippers of competitiveair cargo services. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Efficient Ground-Side Evironment </ITAG>The U.S. seeks to eliminate restrictions, impediments or unduly burdensomerequirements in the ground-side enviornment that interfere with efficiencyof service and a carrier's ability to compete effectively. Among the areasthat U.S. aviation authorities examine closely are: (1) The rights of anairline to perform its own ground handling and to offer ground handlingservices to other airlines, (2) the availability of adequate warehousefacilities at reasonable cost, and (3) the efficiency of customs clearance.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Broad Intermodal Rights </ITAG>The U.S. seeks broad rights for U.S. carriers and freight forwarders tomove cargo by truck and other surface means. Intermodal rights have becomeparticularly critical as air cargo systems have evolved to include door-to-doorservices. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Elimination of Discriminatory Practices </ITAG>The U.S. insists on elimination of discriminatory practices in all aspectsof international air cargo operations. Restrictions which result in discriminationdeny carriers the fundamental right of fair competition; they will notbe tolerated and may result in countermeasures.Negotiating Guidelines In seeking to further U.S. policy objectives through the negotiating process,U.S. authorities confront conflicting interests and objectives. For example,a city's desire to stimulate its local economy and promote commerce throughadditional air services may conflict with the U.S. airline industry's expectationthat additional route rights will be offered to the carriers of a foreigncountry only in the context of a balanced exchange of new opportunities.Different objectives also exist between the U.S. and its aviation partners.Most foreign countries take a more regulatory and protectionist approachto international air cargo services. Moreover, because negotiations involve issues that are complex and technical,differences in understanding can arise at the implementation stage. Tominimize the possibility of such misunderstandings, U.S. negotiators willseek to commit agreements to writing and to define the terms of an agreementas precisely as possible. The following guidelines are designed to assist U.S. negotiators in pursuingthe above objectives: <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Agreements and Proposals Will Be Evaluated in Terms of Actual Opportunitiesand Public Interest Factors </ITAG>The value of air cargo opportunities granted to a country should be comparableto the value of opportunities available to U.S. operators in that country.In practice, air cargo opportunities conferred by an aviation agreementare only of value to the extent U.S. air cargo operators are able to capitalizeon them. Key considerations in measuring actual opportunities availableare the size of the air cargo market to be accessed through the agreementand the quality of the operating environment in the foreign country. Theairlines of a foreign country characterized by a restrictive operatingenvironment should be granted less access than if its environment weremore open. U.S. aviation authorities will also take into account public interest factorsin considering the value to the United States of a proposed exchange ofnew opportunities. Key factors include: the vital importance of air servicesto remote locations and underutilized airports, the benefits for the localbusiness economy of more convenient air services, and the important contributionof air cargo operators to the CRAF program. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Cargo Issues Merit Special Attention </ITAG>Specific treatment of cargo issues in negotiations is essential. Cargoroutes and routing flexibility, the pricing regime for cargo, capacitylimitations (if any), the regime for cargo charters, the requirements ofexpress traffic, and the ground-side operating environment are all mattersthat should be addressed. Specific treatment includes recognition of theimportant role combination services, including maindeck ``combi'' services,play in determining market shares of bilateral air cargo markets. Thisis particularly important in any negotiations involving restricted cargocapacity regimes. The Government also must continue to develop expertise and commit resourcesto cargo issues. It must maintain a close dialogue with industry, as wellas with other constituency groups affected by air cargo operations, toensure that air cargo issues are properly addressed. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. A Flexible Negotiating Posture Best Serves U.S. Cargo Interests</ITAG>If both the foreign government and the United States are seeking new cargoopportunities that are economically comparable, then a cargo-for-cargoexchange may represent a satisfactory exchange for the two sides. In manynegotiations where the U.S. is seeking new cargo opportunities, however,the foreign government involved is often primarily interested in obtainingnew combination opportunities. In these cases, U.S. negotiators can maximizecargo benefits by negotiating agreements based on the leverage available_leveragethat is a function of what the other side is seeking. A flexible negotiating approach preserves the ability of the United Statesto pursue satisfactory resolution of cargo needs and issues, regardlessof the particular circumstances. It should be emphasized, however, thattrades between the passenger and cargo sectors will be entertained onlywhen the U.S. Government determines such a trade to be in the overall interestof the United States.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Special Procedures May Be Necessary To Resolve Doing Business Problems</ITAG>Regulations and policies of a foreign government that impede a carrier'sground-side operations have a serious impact on the competitiveness ofthat carrier's service. Such policies may interfere with the exercise ofrights specifically conferred by a bilateral agreement and thus may representa violation of that agreement. The United States is committed to seekingprompt resolution of such problems.When a doing business issue arises, interested U.S. Government agenciesinvolved will coordinate their actions to bring about a satisfactory resolutionof the issue whether or not it involves a violation of bilateral agreement.U.S. authorities first will seek prompt resolution through diplomatic effortsincluding, if necessary, consultations with all foreign government agencieshaving relevant jurisdiction. When useful, the U.S. will seek to convenespecial working groups or task forces composed of industry representativesand U.S. and foreign government officials at an appropriately responsiblelevel.In cases involving actual violations of bilateral agreements where solutionsare not found through diplomatic consultations, it may become necessaryto take countermeasures against foreign governments or airlines.<ITAG tagnum="85">Appendix A_Excerpts From the Federal Aviation Act</ITAG>Section 102(a)_Factorsfor Interstate, Overseas, and Foreign Air Transportation(a) In the exercise and performance of its powers and duties under thisAct, the Board\1\<NOTE/> shall consider the following, among other things, as beingin the public interest, and in accordance with the public convenience andnecessity:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ On January 1, 1985, the international functions of theCivil Aeronautics Board were transferred to the Department of Transportation.See Civil Aeronautics Board Sunset Act of 1984, Pub.
