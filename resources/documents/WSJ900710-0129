For a while, the crowd listens patiently, if skeptically,to his arguments. Then Mr. Zvyagilsky, a portly mine directorand member of the Ukrainian parliament, pushes his luck.&quot;Your political slogans are an insult to the honor of theCommunist Party,&quot; he gripes. The assembled miners erupt in achorus of jeers, hoots and whistles that forces Mr.Zvyagilsky off the rostrum and out of the stadium.</LP><TEXT>   As he leaves, cursing under his breath, one miner runs upto him waving his fist. &quot;You are all terrible people,&quot; heshouts.   At its Congress in Moscow, the Soviet Communist Party isagonizing over how to regain the confidence of the workingclass. Here in the Soviet industrial heartland, the workersdon't want to hear the answer. On Wednesday, the miners ofDonetsk are planning to join their colleagues around thenation in a one-day strike. Unlike their work stoppage lastsummer, they aren't calling for more soap and sausage. Thistime, it's the Communist Party that they're after.   &quot;This is a normal political strike,&quot; says Valery Chaly, aminers' leader from the town of Stakhanov, which is namedafter the legendary Soviet miner Alexei Stakhanov, who minedmore than 100 tons of coal in one shift in 1935, at theheight of Stalin's industrialization campaign. &quot;We need todestabilize the socialist model that is leading us to ruin.&quot;   Political strikes, of course, are anything but normal inthe Soviet Union. But miners, like many workers, have grownincreasingly bold and restive in the past year. Alarmed aboutan apparent conservative backlash in the party againstMikhail Gorbachev's reforms, they are joining hands withradical democrats to demand the end of party poweraltogether.   Their strike demands include the resignation of thegovernment and decisive moves to remove party influence fromfactories, the army, the KGB, the courts and the nationaleducation system. They also want all party property to behanded over to local government.   &quot;We can see at the Congress that reactionary forces haveconsolidated themselves,&quot; says Viktor Makarenko, a miners'union official. &quot;The party says it's a party of the people,but it's the party of apparatchiks. They defend theirinterests, not ours.&quot;   Such widespread sentiments are a mixed blessing for Mr.Gorbachev. On the one hand, the miners' demands for atransfer of power from the party to elected government are inline with the Soviet president's own political agenda.Although Mr. Gorbachev has urged them not to strike, miners'leaders believe he isn't completely averse to some protestaction. They say it will help him in his battle with themilitary and other party conservatives who are trying to slowthe pace of reform, if not reverse it altogether.   But with the Soviet economy in a deep recession, strikesare the last thing that Mr. Gorbachev needs. Although theminers haven't won the support of others for their one-dayprotest this week, they are lobbying hard to persuade railwayand steel workers to unite with them in future actions. Withthe national mood already restless, the situation couldeasily spiral out of control.   &quot;What we need more than ever before is the highestpossible degree of harmony in society,&quot; Mr. Gorbachev toldthe Congress last week. &quot;This is no time for ultimatums andconflicts, or for ill-considered actions that divide peopleand aggravate the situation.&quot;   Some miners agree. &quot;It's no good going on strike,&quot; saysIlya Matvienko, who has been in a wheelchair since his backwas injured in an accident at the coal face in 1978. &quot;Theycomplain that there is little in the shops. But if peopledon't work, there will be nothing at all in the shops.&quot;   Such moderation is getting harder to find these days inDonetsk, where miners are cooler headed than theircounterparts in other mining communities, such as Vorkuta inNorthern Russia or the Kuznetsk region of Siberia, whereliving conditions are worse. While a few work collectiveshere have decided against joining the strike, and others saythey may not take the whole day off, but just join a protestrally in town for a few hours, public indignation is growinglouder here.   Most miners in the region, which has some of the oldestand deepest coal pits in the nation, are angry that thegovernment has failed to fulfill the pledges it made to endlast year's national strike. They included giving miners agreater say in running their affairs, as well as promising toship in more consumer goods. One year later, people herefume, little has really changed.   &quot;It was a mistake to sign that document; perhaps it wasjust political inexperience,&quot; says Sergei Formanyuk, a memberof the Donetsk town council. He contends that Soviet PrimeMinister Nikolai Ryzhkov agreed to go along with thesettlement, &quot;not because he believed in fulfilling {theconditions}, but because he wanted to end the strike.&quot;   Such feelings of betrayal are widespread, and have alreadyled to big upheavals in Donetsk politics. The town'sCommunist Party leader resigned earlier this year afterminers and others staged mass demonstrations to press for hisremoval. In local elections soon afterwards, radicals won atwo-thirds majority of seats on the town council, makingDonetsk one of only a handful of places in the Ukraine whereconservative party officials lost control. The town councilis actively supporting this week's planned strike.   Moreover, workers at the Kalinin mine in Donetsk moved tofulfil one of their key political demands by voting to closethe offices of the Communist Party committee on the mine'spremises.   Despite these successes, the miners' leaders are unclearabout what to do next. Although they express disdain for theparty Congress now taking place in Moscow, 600 miles away,they admit that its outcome could play an important role intheir future tactics. Many would like to channel theanti-party radicalism of the miners into more constructiveefforts to strengthen the emerging system of elected localgovernment.   Their hope is that radicals will walk out of the Congressand formally set up an alternative party headed by anationwide figure such as Kremlin maverick Boris Yeltsin orAlexander Yakovlev, a liberal Gorbachev confidant currentlyon the Politburo. Such a split would deal a severe blow toparty authority, they say.   But a schism along these lines seems increasinglyunlikely. Messrs. Yeltsin and Yakovlev are both cool aboutleading a split, and Mr. Gorbachev has been doing his best atthe Congress to hold the middle ground. As a result, mostpredict the party will be weakened by an exodus of membersafter the Congress, but not challenged head-on by a breakawayalternative.   &quot;The reality is that, so far, there are no other viablepolitical parties, and there won't be for a long time,&quot; saysYuri Boldyrev, a 39-year-old engineer who is one of theDonetsk strike leaders. &quot;There are only small organizationsformed by intellectuals without a broad base.&quot; He recountshow one radical who has formed his own party, NikolaiTravkin, met with miners last month. His fierce criticism ofthe Communist Party was warmly applauded. But when he startedtalking about his own new group, the Russian Democrats,&quot;people just lost interest,&quot; Mr. Boldyrev says.   Thus for the moment, the passion and political energy ofminers such as Yuri Dubinsky is aimed against the Communists.Mr. Dubinsky sits in the Donetsk stadium surrounded bycolleagues wearing hats made out of newspaper to ward off thestinging midday sun. Roaring his approval as representativesfrom one group after another promise to join this week'sstrike, he holds up a satirical placard.   &quot;We have nothing to lose but our chains,&quot; it declares,quoting Karl Marx, and depicting a worker with a ball andchain wrapped around his neck and arms. But the ball has theinitials KPSS written on it -- Russian for the CommunistParty of the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
