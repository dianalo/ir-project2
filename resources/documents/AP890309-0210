What she turned up became a front-page,nationwide scandal.   At a time when President Jose Sarney pledged to lay off 90,000government functionaries, as part of a drastic plan to halt 1,000percent-plus annual inflation, Ms. Oliveira said she discovered thatnearly half the 560 members of Brazil's two-house Congress haverelatives, lots of them, in soft, high-paying federal jobs.   Senators and representatives, she said, employ wives, sons,daughters, brothers, sisters, nephews and nieces as ``advisers''making the equivalent of $2,000 to $4,000 a month _ in a countrywhere the government-set minimum wage is equal to $64 a month.   The 37-year-old graduate student at the National University ofBrasilia, who also works as a fact checker in Brasilia for the Riode Janeiro newspaper Jornal do Brasil, released her findings to thepress before submitting her thesis to her professors.   Her revelations brought outcries for a cleanup. They alsoresulted in angry warnings from some Congressional staffers to Ms.Oliveira to keep her nose out of their affairs.   ``This was not a cheap trick to sell newspapers or, as somepeople have charged, to provoke a military takeover of Congress,''Ms. Oliveira said in an interview. ``I did it in the interest ofBrazilian national sovereignty.''   Civilian government returned to Brazil in 1985 after 21 years ofmilitary rule, and new officials promised an idealistic ``NewRepublic.''   ``Unfortunately our new democracy is confined to paper,'' Ms.Oliveira said. ``It has not reached people's consciences.''   She said she gathered raw data for her study ``from thecongressional payroll, with help from senators and representativeswho do not practice nepotism.''   She concluded that nepotism in Congress exists across thepolitical spectrum, from right to left.   In the House of Representatives, Ms. Oliveira said, 197 of the485 members employ 279 relatives. Rep. Pedro Ceolin Sobrinho, of theconservative Liberal Front Party, is the leader with 10 familymembers on his staff.   Rep. Jose Mauricio Linhares Barreto, of the left-leaningDemocratic Labor Party, put his 14-year-old son in an advisory post,at $1,176 a month, according to the study.   It also counted 32 of the 75 senators as being nepotistic, withthe leader there being Sen. Humberto Lucena, a former Senatepresident, from President Sarney's centrist Brazilian DemocraticMovement Party. He has four children, a brother, a son-in-law, aniece and a sister-in-law on his payroll.   ``My conscience is clear,'' Lucena commented. ``We are talkingabout `confidential appointments,' permitted by law. My relativesserving in these posts will work only as long as I am in office.They will not become permanent congressional staff members. I hiredmy son-in-law, now divorced from one of my daughters, as a technicaladviser, not because of our relationship but because of his highcompetence. My brother Solon was hired by another senator, not byme.''   Another star of nepotism, according to the researcher, is thepresident's daughter, Roseana Sarney, who joined the staff ofCongress when her father was a senator and who now makes theequivalent of $4,000 a month, while living in in Rio de Janeiro, 750miles from Brasilia.   Senators and representatives may legally hire ``advisers.''Congress members also are given, at taxpayer expense, cars anddrivers, apartments in Brasilia, free mail and telephone use, andfree plane tickets to and from their home states,   ``What's immoral is the nepotism,'' said Ms. Oliveira, who hasdegrees in economics, agronomy and journalism.   Adilson Abreu Dallari, a judge and the author of the book ``TheCivil Servant,'' said in an interview that administrative corruptionhas become ``part of Brazilian culture _ everybody wantssomething.'' He said the roots of the problem go back nearly 500years when Brazilian colonists received grants, favors andhereditary titles from kings of Portugal.   Villas-Boas Correa, a widely read political columnist, said thenepotism scandal ``degrades Congress and political parties and is aninvitation for a military coup, justified on ground of morality.''He added that, like Congress, state legislatures and city hallsthroughout this nation of 144 million ``are full of `ghosts,' civilservants who do no work and show up only to pick up theirpaychecks.''   The first secretary of the Senate, Antonio Mendes Canalle, saidthat as a result of Ms. Oliveira's findings, the Senate now willdraw up a list to see who does what and works where.   But the speaker of the House, Rep. Antonio Paes de Andrade, whoserves as acting president of Brazil when Sarney is out of thecountry, told the AP that staff hiring is the ``exclusiveresponsibility'' of each legislator.   Soon afterward, Paes de Andrade made news when, while Sarney wasin Japan for Emperor Hirohito's funeral in February, he loaded twopresidential jets with friends, relatives, political cronies andjournalists and flew them to a welcoming ceremony in his humble hometown in Brazil's impoverished Northeast.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thu AMs, March 16</NOTE></DOC>
