(reduced-instruction-set computer,complex-instruction-set computer)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Ditzel, David R.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Almost all microcomputer manufacturers are basing their nextgeneration of microcomputers on reduced-instruction-set computer(RISC) architecture, making the 'RISC vs CISC'(complex-instruction-set computer) debate almost irrelevant.andP;  Itis obvious that RISC-based microcomputers run faster and moreefficiently.andP;  Some proponents of CISC say that CISC can becomeRISC by incorporating 'RISC techniques,' but it is absurd to addto a technology in order to make it simpler.andP;  RISC architectureoffers a better interface between the hardware and the compiler,and makes chips easier to implement and design.andP;  The shorterdevelopment time means that RISC chips will always be the first touse new techniques.andP;  RISC uses the power of new compilertechnology to optimize use of both hardware and software.andP;  RISCbenefits include better pipelining, fewer gates, and shorter cycletimes.andP;  RISC also encourages many companies to participate inmicroprocessor design, eliminating the dominance of a few largecompanies.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Reduced-instruction-set computersProcessor architectureComputer industryComplex-instruction-set computersCost Benefit AnalysisMicrocomputersHardwareDesignPerformance ImprovementProduct Development.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
