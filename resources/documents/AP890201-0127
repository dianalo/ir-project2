The survey, by groups opposed to the pay raise, was released asHouse Speaker Jim Wright conducted his own questionnaire on the payissue that left open the possibility of a House vote.   Wright, who had planned to allow the increase to become law Feb.8 without a vote in the House, now says members can have a vote ifthey express that view in the survey. But the speaker said heexpected members to tell him what they already communicatedprivately: they want the raise without a vote, even if the Senatedefeats the pay hike as expected this week.   The raise would become law Feb. 8 unless both houses vote to stopit. Members of Congress would have their salaries increased from$89,500 to $135,000.   The new survey said 270 House members, or about 62 percent, saidthey would oppose the raise if it came to a vote. Forty-seven, orabout 11 percent, said they would support the raise; 75 members,about 17 percent, declined to state a position, and 41 members,about 9 percent, declined to respond.   Of those willing to take a position, 85 percent said they opposedthe raise, according to the survey, conducted by Public Citizen, aconsumer advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader; the NationalTaxpayers Union, a non-partisan organization of fiscalconsdrvatives; and Coalitions for America, a conservativeorganization headed by activist Paul Wey;rich.   ``A failure to vote on this issue would be a fundamentalbreakdown of democracy,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of PublicCitizen.   Wright said Tuesday he ordered his survey to prove he is not adictator preventing a vote, but a leader who is following theprivate wishes of members.   While House members were sending their survey answers to Wright,Senate opponents of the raise told the Senate Governmental AffairsCommittee that the increase was too big, and that the system wasflawed by allowing it to become law without a vote.   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., said the system sets a bad examplefor young Americans and commented, ``What must they think of us,when we run from accountability, as cockroaches run from brightlight?''   ``A pay raise without a timely vote in both houses is stealing,''he said.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. said he was worried about Congress'reputation because, ``People all over the United States are saying,`They're a bunch of crooks'.''   But committee member Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said the raise wasneeded, especially for judges and federal officials.   ``What does it cost government to have incompetent people at thetop?'' Stevens asked.   Tuesday, supporters of the pay plan urged that the increase atleast be approved for judges and top federal executives, even iflawmakers are unwilling to raise their own salary.   The raise will become law a week from today unless both housesvote to stop it. Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine,said senators will vote Thursday or Friday, and an Associated PressSurvey indicates at least 88 of them will oppose the raise.   Should the raise become law, the House and Senate would each voteimmediately afterward on measures to bar outside income, includingspeaking fees, according to congressional leaders.   While opponents said they would try to have Congress rescind anyraise that became law, they would have a rough time convincingcolleagues to take such action once the speaking fees, known ashonoraria, are banned. Lawmakers would be reluctant to accept thenet loss of income if their raise and honoraria were taken away.   House Democratic leadership sources, speaking only on conditionthey not be named, said Wright acted on his own to order the survey,with Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., and Majority Whip TonyCoelho, D-Calif., apparently cool to the idea.   ``He (Wright) became the lightning rod'' for editorial writersand voters who criticized a no-vote strategy, even though the tactichad quiet, bipartisan support, said one leadership source. ``He'sbeen concerned about the misconception the speaker is preventing avocal majority of members from voting on something they want to voteon.''   In fact, Wright told reporters: ``Over the past several weeks, Ihave heard from many members on both sides of the aisle. I have apretty good idea of how they feel. They support `regularprocedure,''' a term that means a lengthy process that would make itimpossible to vote by next Wednesday.   But when asked if he would permit a vote should members surprisehim and demand one, Wright said, ``If the members want it, yes, ofcourse.''   Coelho, who is directing bipartisan negotiations on a package ofoutside income restrictions, said the talks are focusing on theseareas:   _ Honoraria travel. Negotiators are looking at a time limit ontravel for members invited to speak, thus preventing somene fromreceiving a week at a posh resort for making a single speech.However, Coelho said there would be exceptions for multi-day events.   _ When to end the ``grandfather'' loophole in campaign financinglaw. The loophole has allowed 190 House members who were in officeas of Jan. 8, 1980, to stockpile more than $39 million in surpluscampaign money for their personal use. Coelho said there issentiment, although no agreement, to allow members to retire withtheir cash at the end of their current term and then bar personaluse of the money starting in January 1991.   _ Restriction on outside income other than honoraria. Probablythe toughest part of the proposal, negotiators are trying to decidehow to restrict attorneys' fees, book royalties and other earnedincome. Coelho said it was possible that some forms of income, likeattorneys' fees, would be banned altogether while a percentagelimitation would be placed on outside earnings not under the ban.</TEXT></DOC>
