John Ahearne, chairman of Watkins' independent advisory panel onnuclear safety, said Wednesday that Watkins' stricter safetyapproach apparently has not yet penetrated the middle managementand lower-level workers at Savannah River.   ``What we are questioning is the effectiveness'' ofsafety-related improvement programs at Savannah River, which isoperated by Westinghouse Electric Corp. under an Energy Departmentcontract, Ahearne said in a telephone interview.   The Ahearne panel said in a letter to Watkins last Friday thatWestinghouse appeared to be relying on its training program toimpart the new emphasis on safety.   ``This will not be enough,'' the letter said.   At Savannah River, near Aiken, S.C., Westinghouse spokeswomanBecky Apter said the company has made numerous improvements insafety training programs to bring the plant up to the standards ofthe civilian nuclear industry.   Ms. Apter declined to directly dispute the Ahearne panel'sassertions but said the group was told during a visit to the plantlast September that numerous improvements were under way, includingtraining on reactor simulators.   Ahearne's group applauded what it called numerous positivechanges at Savannah River since Westinghouse took over last April,but it also raised serious questions.   ``Procedural errors and reporting problems continue and indicatethat an emphasis on safety of operations is not yet pervasive,''the panel said in its report to Watkins.   The plant's nuclear reactors, the nation's only source oftritium used to make nuclear warheads, have been shut down for morethan a year for safety reasons that include doubts about the skillsand attitudes of plant workers.   An accident during an attempted restart of one Savannah Riverreactor in August 1988 led to the hiatus. The accident wasattributed in part to operator error and led to investigations thatuncovered deep-seated safety lapses.   Watkins has made getting the Savannah River reactors runningagain by next year a top priority.   Ahearne panel's conclusions suggest Savannah River's flaws arefar from fixed.   The panel said it was generally pleased with Westinghouse'sprogram for training reactor operators, but the training was``missing coverage of reactors fundamentals'' that are alwaysincluded in training for commercial nuclear plants.   ``This omission ... may belie Westinghouse's claim that safetyis their primary concern,'' the report said.   Watkins has raised questions about Westinghouse's commitment toSavannah River.   In a letter to Westinghouse president Paul Lego in July, Watkinssaid his review of the company's blueprint for restarting thereactors caused him concern ``that Westinghouse still does notappreciate the magnitude of the problems it faces.''   Copies of the July 17 letter and Lego's response were obtainedWednesday by The Associated Press under the Freedom of InformationAct.   Watkins, citing a concern that Ahearne said still remains,suggested to Lego that more competent people should be assigned toSavannah River to resolve the safety problems.   ``Let me reiterate that I am more concerned with thecapabilities of the individuals involved than numbers of people,''Watkins wrote. ``It would be a grave mistake to imagine that theproblems cited can be corrected merely by adding to the numbers.''</TEXT></DOC>
