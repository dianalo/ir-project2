Valdez became a place on naval charts in 1790 when a Spanishexplorer, Salvador Fidalgo, saw the port's exquisite beauty andnamed it for his boss _ just as Captain James Cook named PrinceWilliam Sound for his.   It remained only that, a name on a map, until 1898 whengold-seekers docked here to take a shortcut to the Klondike over anIndian trail across the Valdez glacier. Many of them decided halfwayacross the rugged ice that no amount of gold was worth the trip andcame back. Before long Valdez became a town of more than 4,500.   When the gold boom died Valdez survived. But for decade afterdecade misfortune seemed to visit little Valdez, with uncommonregularity, mostly fires, sometimes disease. Somehow it managed tosettle into a close-knit community with schools and churches and afishing fleet and a way of life that sturdy folk with an eye fornature's gifts found attractive.   Then, in 1964, America's worst earthquake struck. It recorded 8.5on the Richter scale and its epicenter was in Prince William Sound.It destroyed Valdez. It left the ground under what remained of thetown so unstable that everybody had to move to a more solidfoundation 10 miles away.   They brought with them the town fire bell, which had saved manyof them, and the oaken bar from the Pinzon Saloon, which hadsuccored many more. Both are in Joe Leahy's museum. They laid out anew town with broad streets and grand old trees where bald eaglesnested.   The new Valdez prospered _ especially when it was chosen as theterminal of the oil pipeline.   ``But the town always knew that the oil bonanza could endsomeday, just as the gold bonanza did,'' Leahy says.   So when Valdez rebuilt, it put its chips not on oil but ontourism. Fifty cruise ships tie up every summer at Valdez andhundreds of visitors, awed by the scenery and the town'shospitality, come ashore for about a three-hour stay. Other touristsmotor here in campers and stay longer. All in all, about 100,000sightseers a year.   The largest item on the town budget is for beautification _flowers, trees, grass.   ``Look at it now,'' says Leahy. ``Cyclone fences with barbed wireon top. We never allowed that before, but Exxon seems to need it.Security guards are at every building where Exxon has rented officespace. Security guards! In Valdez!   ``A stand of trees has been bulldozed to make room for thosetemporary barracks and other equipment. Well. Eagles used to perchthere. An eagle won't sit on an Exxon radio tower or satellite dish.   ``If what the tourists see here is chaos, they certainly won'trecommend an Alaska cruise to their neighbors. The people withcampers will stay away, too, when word gets around on the CB radiocircuit that there's no place to park.''   There is, in fact, no place to park. Or to sleep. Where willValdez accommodate the seasonal workers who come every summer tooperate the fish processing plants? Nobody knows. But then theremight not be much fish processing this year. The oil spill haseliminated commercial fishing in the most productive salmon area ofPrince William Sound.   Some in Valdez, of course, benefit from the spill.   A local joke, alluding to the charges against the skipper of theExxon Valdez, is that Exxon is spending money like a drunken sailor.   The company pays up to $25 an hour, counting the overtime, tohelp clean up the oil. A fisherman can get $1,000 a day for the useof his boat to go skim oil. So why fish? One Valdezian, a labtechnician, appalled at the largesse, earned $2,700 for a week'swork and donated most of it to the Prince William Sound ConservationAlliance for lobbying against oil interests.   In Valdez, rooms in private homes are going for $100 a night, amattress on the floor for $50. At one restaurant the menu wasreprinted. Same menu, higher prices. The Pipeline Club, a popularplace for dinner, doubled its staff but not its prices and doubledits profits. It now serves breakfast and lunch as well as dinner andkeeps the bar open from 8 a.m. until 5 a.m., when state law says itmust close.   On the day of the spill, a woman from Fairbanks drove 350 milesto a Valdez trailer park where she rents out her camper for $60 anight from each of four people, two to a bed. No toilet. JackieRobb, the manager of the Valdez branch bank, posted signs askingcampers please not to use the parking lot as a restroom.   Valdez had never had a fast-food joint. Now it has. A trailerwith a window in the side pulled up near the dock with three signs:``Burger King,'' ``Open,'' and ``Help Wanted.''   Tom McAlister, the fire marshal, has postponed his retirementplans. ``I can't leave the town like this,'' he says. ``I justcan't.'' His wife, Gloria, says she has to wait dinner for Tom everynight, sometimes until midnight.   Joe Michaud, the police chief, has his hands full as well.   He has been too busy to compile the figures for May and June, butin April he recorded 81 arrests. Last April he recorded 15. Lastyear the Valdez ambulance answered 20 calls, this year, so far, 44.Drunk drivers all of last year totaled three. So far this year, morethan 20.   ``I certainly understand people going where they can to find ajob,'' says Michaud. ``I've done that myself. And 90 percent ofthese people cause no trouble even though just being here is a realstrain on the town.   ``We will get through this. We will handle it.''   Yes. But it does seem unfair that the little village destroyed byAmerica's worst earthquake must endure the anguish of America'sworst oil spill.   ``It is unfair,'' says Pat Lynn. ``Because the earthquake wasnature's doing. This was man's.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
