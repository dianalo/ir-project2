Faltering economies plague almost every member of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. So far, adecline in financial muscle -- due in part to weak oil prices-- has contributed to a failed coup in Venezuela, helpeddrive Algeria to the brink of civil war, and even sent OPECkingpin Saudi Arabia for the first time ever into thefinancial markets to borrow money. Where periodic declines inoil revenue were once accepted stoically, particularly in thePersian Gulf region, &quot;OPEC members are now fighting for everyhalf-barrel they can get for themselves,&quot; one senior OPECdelegate said.</LP><TEXT>   The 13 oil ministers -- some of them arriving at the talksdirectly from unrest at home -- seem convinced that in totalthey are producing too much for current market conditions andthat an oil glut may be just around the corner as petroleumdemand begins to slacken seasonally in the spring. All alsoare apparently in accord that total OPEC production,currently around 24.2 million barrels a day, must be trimmedfor the second quarter, if not immediately, to prevent oilprices from falling further.   After the second day of talks, however, it was clear thatthe oil ministers still were split over how much to reduceproduction and, more important, how to share the cuts. Amajority supports a new production ceiling of around 22.5million barrels a day, or more than 1.5 million barrels belowcurrent output.   But they have run up against Saudi Arabia, the group'slargest producer. which is insistent upon keeping its hugeshare of the market. To replace oil exports closed down byIraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 and to fuel theneeds of the Persian Gulf war machine that followed, SaudiArabia expanded its production from 5.4 million barrels a dayto 8.5 million.   Smaller producers which weren't able to increase their oiloutput, such as Algeria, look to Saudi Arabia to lead the wayin correcting the oversupply problem. But the kingdom, havingspent vast sums to expand its output, claims title toone-third of OPEC's total production, whatever it may be,versus one-fourth prior to the Persian Gulf crisis. And now,the Saudis are reticent about giving up their new marketshare or allowing output to drop below eight million barrelsdaily.   Hisham Nazer, the oil minister, has made clear that thekingdom will reduce output only if other OPEC members cutproportionately. The Saudi position has been that the secondquarter production level for OPEC should be set at 23 millionbarrels a day. That is the level at which the Saudis pegworld demand for OPEC oil for the period.   Other delegates said, however, that the Saudis haveindicated they would consider an output ceiling of 22.8million barrels a day -- matching the estimate from OPEC'sown economists for demand in the second quarter. That wouldsuggest that the difference between the Saudi idea of aproduction ceiling and that of the other OPEC members issmall. And several oil ministers said yesterday that thedifference has &quot;narrowed&quot; to 300,000 barrels a day.   Still, a reduction of at least 1.2 million barrels a daywould be required to meet this production level. The Saudisinsist that should be accomplished through a percentage cutacross the board. The figure most mentioned is 5%.   Also, Mr. Nazer, who has kept a low profile through muchof this meeting, wants any new system of country quotas --abandoned in the wake of the start of the Persian Gulf crisis-- to be based on capacity or on actual production withouttaking into account the old outdated formulas. &quot;Call it theSaudi formula,&quot; said John Lichtblau, chairman of PetroleumIndustry Research Foundation and an observer at the meetinghere. &quot;It's clearly a meeting based on a Saudi position,&quot; headded.   Indeed, after numerous rounds of informal meetingsyesterday the 13 ministers had essentially divided into twocamps with Saudi Arabia in one and the remaining members inthe other. Still, several ministers insisted they had madeprogress. &quot;We are still working, and we feel we are gettingcloser,&quot; Celestino Armas, the Venezuelan minister said. &quot;Wehave to take some time to assess the situation.&quot;   The oil ministers, hopeful they can hammer out an accordtoday, continued their deliberations late last night. Thereis some urgency, because the longer the meeting drags on, themore jittery oil markets get.   Last night, the other ministers were awaiting a responseby Saudi Arabia to a production policy proposal they hadcompiled during the day. Jibril Aminu, the Nigerian ministerand president of OPEC, and Saudi delegates separatelyconfirmed that the kingdom was preparing a response to theproposal, which apparently calls for a production ceiling of22.5 million barrels a day and may also provide a formula fordividing the required production cuts.   At that production level, Jack Wilkinson, chief economistfor Sun Co., estimates the price for West Texas Intermediate,the U.S. benchmark crude, would stabilize at about $19 abarrel.   All the OPEC countries are cash hungry, which means that,whatever the outcome of the talks, members are more likelythan usual to observe a pact. Three of the group's members --Iran, Iraq and Kuwait -- are rebuilding following wars thatwreaked havoc on their economies. In Iran, for instance, lackof capital to properly maintain its oil fields frequentlyputs a cap on daily output at 3.3 million barrels a day eventhough it claims production of 3.6 million a day, industryexperts say.   Venezuela, where the government was almost overthrown in arecent political coup, needs a rising cash flow. And Algeria,rocked by religious unrest fomented in part by financialcalamity, will likely have more difficulty in attracting theforeign investment it wants to help run its oilfields.   Saudi Arabia is no exception. Although it earned anestimated $50 billion in oil revenue last year, it has beenhard put to pay off its share of the Persian Gulf War.</TEXT></DOC>
