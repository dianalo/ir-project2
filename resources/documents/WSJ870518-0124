The North-South railroad was already controversial before the fraud was disclosed last week. Meant to promote agriculture in the country's desolate central region by linking it with Acailandia in the seaboard state of Maranhao -- home of the president and Transportation Minister Jose Reinaldo Tavares -- the railroad was dismissed by many critics as ill-conceived, extravagant and little better than useless: &quot;The train from nowhere to nowhere.&quot;    Then, last week, the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper said that contracts, valued at more than $1 billion and covering more than half the railroad's 967 miles, were awarded 18 companies before the results of the contract bidding had been announced. The newspaper demonstrated that it had published the results of the bidding in a small, coded advertisement the week before the winning bids were unveiled.    Because the railroad would connect Mr. Sarney's home state with Anapolis, near the capital of Brasilia, and because he approved its construction over the objections of several government ministers, it is a project on which the president has effectively staked his tattered reputation.    Now, according to political sources, he may be seeking a way out of the crisis by agreeing to direct presidential elections in November of 1988.    In exchange, he would demand political support for the railroad from the dominant Brazilian Democratic Movement, or PMDB, and a commitment to let him run for reelection. The length of the president's term -- originally set to last until 1990 -- is currently being discussed in Brazil's congress as part of the preparation of a new constitution. So, too, is the question of eligibility for a second term.    Support for elections next year, both in congress and among the public, has been growing as the president has appeared increasingly weak and indecisive. An opinion poll published over the weekend by Folha said 80% of the population favors elections next year.    The fraud comes at a time when President Sarney is being dogged by economic woes. Brazil is grappling with annual inflation of more than 800%, its trade performance is slumping and the country still is hobbled by its $108 billion of foreign debt on which it has suspended payments. Internal divisions on how to handle the economy have led to the recent resignations of a number of government officials including, last month, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro.    These problems have contributed to a widespread sense that the president has lost control of the country. That was reinforced last month when he was unable to impose his choice to succeed Mr. Funaro.    The government's response to the railroad scandal has been marked by characteristic confusion. The president said he already was aware of the fraud and had prepared to cancel the contracts before the newspaper report. However, Mr. Sarney didn't explain why he hadn't immediately done so. Meanwhile, Paulo Vivacqua, chairman of Valec, the state company overseeing the project, said he only learned of the fraud in the press.    Nobody in the government has offered an explanation for the fraud. Instead, officials close to the president have defended the railroad and said there will be new bidding in a month. But companies found by police and official investigations to have acted fraudulently will be excluded from the new bidding. If the fraud is the work of all, or even most, of the 18 companies -- Brazil's biggest civil engineering concerns -- it is unclear who would build the railroad.    Critics of the railroad say the project was approved without serious study of its viability, and they question the construction of a north-south railroad through generally uncultivated land when an east-west railroad would link the more fertile areas of Rondonia and Mato Grasso with the sea. They also say that independent experts put the cost of the railroad at more than twice the $2.4 billion envisioned by its supporters, and question whether that expense can be justified given Brazil's current economic problems. </TEXT></DOC>
