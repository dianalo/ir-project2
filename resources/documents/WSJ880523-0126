This past December, an administrative law judge of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission upheld most civil charges by the department's separate Occupational Safety and Health Administration against Los Angeles-based Unocal, following an eight-week trial.    R.M. Child, the law judge, ruled that the fire and explosion at the company's Lemont, Ill., refinery southwest of Chicago resulted from company conduct that was &quot;voluntarily done with intentional or careless disregard&quot; for the requirements of federal law &quot;or with plain indifference to employee safety.&quot;    Unocal has appealed the law judge's decision to the federal appeals court in Chicago. OSHA issued citations in January 1985, charging Unocal with three willful violations and one serious violation, and sought fines of $31,000. The law judge pared that amount to $22,000.    OSHA said its inspection of the explosion, which seriously injured many others workers and nearly destroyed the refinery workplace, focused on a ruptured pressure vessel that was propelled 3,200 feet out of the work area by the explosion. The rupture allowed the escape of large amounts of liquefied petroleum gas vapors that ignited, causing a fireball and explosion that shook the ground for 50 miles.    Mr. Child found that Union Oil Co., Unocal's name at the time, failed to inspect for cracks in its pressure vessels, establish emergency evacuation procedures, provide fire-protective clothing for operating personnel or adequately train the refinery's fire-fighting brigade. The 17 deaths included 10 firefighters.    OSHA said it asked U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas in Chicago to consider initiating criminal charges, because willful violations and fatalities were involved in the civil case. The department would decide what type of charges, if any, to bring.    OSHA seeks criminal charges infrequently, having asked for Justice Department consideration of such action 48 times in OSHA's 17-year history. The Justice Department filed charges in 22 of those cases, and an additional 10 OSHA requests are pending, including the latest one involving Unocal, the agency said.    The Justice Department declined to comment on the matter.    In a prepared statement, Unocal said it &quot;fails to understand&quot; why the Labor Department referred the issue to the U.S. attorney to consider criminal charges and will vigorously defend itself and its employees.    The company's appeal of the OSHA law judge's finding argues that the judge's finding was improper and didn't reflect the preponderance of the evidence presented, Unocal said.    ---   Eileen White Read in Los Angeles contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
