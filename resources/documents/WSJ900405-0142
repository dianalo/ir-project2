This is the majorquestion addressed by two new books, John Dinges's &quot;Our Manin Panama: How General Noriega Used the U.S. -- and MadeMillions in Drugs and Arms&quot; (Random House, 320 pages,$21.95), and Frederick Kempe's &quot;Divorcing the Dictator:America's Bungled Affair With Noriega&quot; (Putnam, 469 pages,$24.95). Mr. Dinges, a contributor to, among others, theWashington Post and Time magazine, and Mr. Kempe, a Journalstaff reporter, both describe how U.S. administrationsrepeatedly opted for short-term benefits over long-termcosts. In the end, it took 25,000 U.S. troops and severalhundred casualties to undo the damage.   Although both books cover much the same ground, theydiffer in a number of ways, with Mr. Kempe, for example,refusing to downplay the damage done by the Panama policy ofPresident Carter. To win passage of the controversial PanamaCanal treaties, the Carter administration worked overtime towhitewash the Omar Torrijos regime of charges involving drugtrafficking, money laundering for the Mafia and secretdealings with Castro that helped Cuba circumvent the U.S.trade embargo. After Congress passed the treaties, the Carteradministration had yet another reason to ignore mountingevidence that Torrijos also was shipping guns and ammunitionto the Sandinistas: Torrijos took the unwanted, deposed Shahof Iran, extricating the U.S. from a sticky situation.</LP><TEXT>   As Mr. Dinges points out, the Carter administration didremove Manuel Antonio Noriega, then Torrijos's corrupt headof intelligence, from the U.S. government payroll, after ahistory of drug involvement, rape and double-dealing againstthe U.S. But as Mr. Kempe shows, Torrijos then went on toexpand his National Guard &quot;with the blessing and assistanceof the U.S.,&quot; increasing its budget from $10 million to $100million in 1978 alone. He argues that the canal negotiationseffectively legitimized the Torrijos regime and allowed it tocreate &quot;the system of corruption and broad military powerthat Noriega would later exploit to repress a nation.&quot;   Once Torrijos died in a 1981 plane crash, Noriega did justthat with no protests from Washington, which calculated, asMr. Kempe notes, that &quot;he belonged twenty percent to them andeighty percent to us.&quot; Coddling Noriega, argues Mr. Dinges,gave the Reagan administration a &quot;staging area for itsexpanding military activities in Nicaragua and El Salvador. .. .&quot; Noriega also conveniently arranged for the fraudulentelection in 1984 of Nicolas Ardito Barletta, &quot;a presidentialcandidate he knew Washington would accept,&quot; and made &quot;all theright noises about the war on drugs.&quot;   Both Messrs. Kempe and Dinges show that the ties betweenthe U.S. and Noriega only began fraying after his criminalbehavior became impossible to ignore. The discovery in 1984of the beheaded corpse of Hugo Spadafora, an outspokenNoriega critic, prompted Sen. Jesse Helms to hold hearings. ANew York Times front page article in June 1986 linked Noriegato drugs, Marxist guerrillas, illicit money and the Spadaforamurder. Finally came the Florida indictments against Noriega.   But even then, with a bipartisan, anti-Noriega consensusin Congress, the Reagan administration could not agree on acourse of action. Economic sanctions were imposed because,Mr. Kempe argues, they represented &quot;the only step thatneither State nor Defense would block.&quot; Mr. Kempe also writesthat Mr. Reagan's subsequent plan to trade the Florida drugindictments against Noriega for his resignation was opposedby Vice President Bush because he feared it would provideMichael Dukakis with campaign ammunition. Both Messrs. Kempeand Dinges, however, question whether Noriega was seriousabout making the deal anyhow.   Only after bungling an opportunity to back an attemptedcoup against Noriega last October did the Bush administrationfinally decide to dump him. Mr. Kempe regards the invasion assuccessful, &quot;if costly.&quot; Mr. Dinges, upholding the orthodoxleft-liberal line, argues that the invasion is evidence ofWashington's double standard, since the &quot;scale of murder andrepression in Panama under Noriega was far from the killing,torture and disappearances carried out during much of thesame period in Chile, Argentina, El Salvador and Guatemalawith considerably less U.S. official condemnation.&quot;   Both authors conclude that Washington's Panama policy wasimprovised from beginning to end. For Mr. Kempe, the Panamacase drives home &quot;the cost to America of abandoning itsdemocratic principles and implementing short-term foreignpolicy goals.&quot; Mr. Dinges feels the underlying problem isthat Washington's &quot;real first priority&quot; never was democracybut &quot;the defense against challenges to U.S. influence in thearea.&quot;   Now that Latin America's dictators, with the exception ofFidel Castro, have passed from the scene, it is tempting toconclude that the lessons of Panama are no longer relevant.But the &quot;twilight of the tyrants&quot; was announced once before,by journalist Tad Szulc in 1959. Shortly thereafter, LatinAmerica was again ruled largely by dictators. It is hopedthis will not happen again. But if it does, &quot;Divorcing theDictator&quot; and &quot;Our Man in Panama&quot; should be required readingfor all U.S. policy makers.   ---   Ms. Purcell is vice president for Latin American affairsat the Americas Society in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
