It is expected to increase 1.7 percentin the second quarter of 1991, 1.8 percent in the third and 0.5 percent in thefourth.;    Meanwhile, the government reported today that initial claims forstate unemployment insurance on a seasonally adjusted basis fell 6,000 in theweek ended May 25 to 439,000 from 445,000 the previous week.;    In the weekended May 18, a total of 3,512,000 persons were receiving state unemploymentbenefits, down 82,000 from the previous week.;    The number of personsreceiving unemployment benefits as a percentage of those covered byunemployment insurance fell to 3.3 percent in the week ended May 18 from 3.4percent the week before.;    About 25 states showed declines for the week inthe level of initial claims. California, because of increased hiring in theagricultural sector, had the largest decline, with 4,261 fewer claims, theofficial said.;    Many economists had expected capital spending to slow thisyear in the midst of the recession and falling corporate profits.;    Anyincrease, however, would help stimulate the economy and pick up some of theslack from sluggish consumer spending.;    In addition, spending to replaceaging plants and equipment and expand facilities helps to boost U.S.productivity, an increasingly important factor in view of stiff competitionfrom overseas.;    Productivity, which also is considered vital to improvingAmericans' standard of living without boosting inflation, rose just 0.3percent at an annual rate during the first three months of 1991.;    That'swell below the average growth of 1.6 percent a year between 1982 and 1989.Productivity is defined as output per hours worked.;    In its initial surveyof 1991 plans last November and December, Commerce said businesses planned a0.4 percent increase. Another survey between January and March projected a 3.2percent advance. A large part of the difference between the first estimate andsubsequent projections was due to changes in computing price increases.;   Capital spending, which shot up 10.4 percent in 1989, slowed to 4.5 percentlast year as the economy fell into the recession. Spending had increased 9.5percent in 1988 and 3.1 percent a year earlier. The figures have been adjustedfor inflation.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910606  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  476  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday June 6, 199100158130,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
