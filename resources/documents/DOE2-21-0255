Chemical decontaminationhas become a common technique for reducing person-rem exposures. Twovendors are currently offering low-concentration chemical decontaminationreagents for application in boiling water reactor and pressurized waterreactor systems. All technical aspects associated with the chemical decontaminationtechnology have been commercially tested and are well advanced beyondthe research and development stage. Extensive corrosion and materialcompatibility testing has been performed on the major solvent systemswith satisfactory results. The material compatibility testing for thethree main solvent systems, CANDECON, CITROX, and LOMI, has been documentedin numerous Electric Power Research Institute reports.</TEXT></DOC>
