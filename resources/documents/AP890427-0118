WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp is halting morethan $100 million in low-income housing renovation projectsfollowing an investigation that found former top HUD appointees wonlucrative contracts through a system rife with favoritism,officials said today.   The report by the Housing and Urban Development Departmentinspector general said HUD agreed to pay $59 million in excesshousing assistance over the life of 15-year contracts that theinspector general examined. The report said if the pattern existsthroughout the program, the excess could approach $413 million.   Kemp said he was halting all fiscal 1989 funding for programs inwhich contracts had not yet been agreed upon and ordering an auditof existing contracts.   His actions stopped funding for 35 projects valued at more than$100 million while they are reconsidered, Kemp's assistant, MaryBrunette, said today. Eight other projects for which contracts werealready in place will be allowed to continue, subject to audit, shesaid.   Kemp said Wednesday that the investigation by the HUD inspectorgeneral found ``fundamental flaws'' in the department's ModerateRehabilitation program.   He said the investigation revealed that the selection andallocation process ``was undocumented, ignored existing standardsand regulations, and was based on the perception and reality offavoritism and abuse of non-public information.''   The report centered on a rehabilitation program that provides$225 million a year for housing in which developers acquire andrenovate existing projects. By winning the contracts with HUD,developers are able to receive low-interest commercial loans backedwith HUD's guarantee of federally subsidized tenants.   The report by HUD Inspector General Paul Adams said former HUDofficials and employees, actively participated, often as developersor consultants, in the projects.   It named top-ranking HUD officials during the Reaganadministration, including former under secretary Philip Abrams andformer assistant secretary for housing Philip Winn, who laterbecame owner-developers in half a dozen rehabilitation projects.   Winn is now the ambassador to Switzerland. Both he and Abramsare from Colorado. Efforts to reach them by telephone were notimmediately successful.   The report named several other former HUD officials who earnedmoney as consultants on the projects after leaving government.Among them was Joseph Strauss, a former special assistant tothen-HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce. The report said Strauss collected$1.3 million in consultant fees on such projects.   Pierce's one-time executive assistant, Lance Wilson, was alsoidentified as an owner-developer in six projects.   Adams said today he found no evidence of criminal activity, butthat the report was turned over to the Justice Department's publicintegrity section for review.   ``We at HUD are committed to ending both the reality and theperception that HUD's funding processes have been tolerant of orinattentive to program abuse,'' Kemp said in a prepared statement.``However, the inspector general has assured me that hisinvestigation found no evidence of criminality or legal wrongdoingof any kind.''   The audit was critical of HUD management as well as managementby locally run public housing authorities.   ``We concluded that the moderate rehabilitation program waspoorly managed,'' the report said. ``There was little or nodocumentation or accountability for the public housing authoritiesselected by HUD headquarters to receive the funding allocations.   ``Moreover the housing authorities selected developers withoutcomplying with the need for an effective competitive selectionprocess, and oftentimes in violation of their own administrativeplans. There was an absence of clear written policy andguidelines.''   The investigation covered the rehabilitation of 35,780 unitsover a five -year period, 1984-1988. It found favoritism in theawarding of the funding, saying that over half the units in thatperiod were awarded in 10 states, which by HUD formula were fairlyentitled to only 16 percent of the units.   Those states were Florida, Colorado, Oklahoma, Virginia, Nevada,Utah, Illinois and Louisiana, as well as Puerto Rico and theDistrict of Columbia.   The report said former HUD officials and employees ``activelysought and participated in the program as developers, consultantsor lender representatives.'' Of 69 projects examined, such formerinsiders participated in 55, it said.   It said consultants received fees of $500 to $1,500 per unitfrom developers, and that often there was no written contracts.   ``A perception of favoritism and abuse evolved, therebyimpacting program integrity.'' it said.   The report said, ``There is little assurance that housing isbeing provided to those locales having the greatest need, and thatlimited program funds are being spent efficiently and effectively.''   Kemp said he was canceling all funding selections in the programfor the current fiscal year that are still pending, and that over300 projects already executed will be audited. He said he asked forthe HUD general counsel to review existing governmental anddepartment ethics and personnel laws and regulations in light ofthe finding.</TEXT></DOC>
