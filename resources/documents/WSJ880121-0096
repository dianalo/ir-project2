And in the symbols that the Rev. Norm White and Maureen Ward live by, you can sense the raw emotions roiling Iowa's Roman Catholic vote this year -- and the widening split, politically, among Catholics nationally.    Father White's symbol is the bumper sticker above his desk that fairly shouts the personal political convictions of this feisty, wispy-haired Catholic priest. &quot;If Reagan is right,&quot; it reads, &quot;then Jesus is wrong.&quot;    Clearly, Father White is a liberal; the Feb. 8 Iowa caucuses will find him huddling with area Democrats. Electing a Democratic president is paramount to this 63-year-old social activist -- even though no major Democratic candidate shares his profound opposition to abortion.    &quot;It's a terrible compromise for me,&quot; says Father White, the Catholic Rural Life director for this archdiocese. &quot;Still, I finally came to the conclusion that Republicans aren't 'pro-life' beyond the birth of the baby.&quot;    But Maureen Ward, a registered Democrat, has abandoned that party because of another symbol. It's the red rose, emblem of the Right to Life movement. Tonight, eve of the 15th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, will find Mrs. Ward, an anti-abortion activist, at a prayer vigil here. And Feb. 8 will find this hereditary Democrat caucusing with the Republicans.    &quot;This issue (abortion) is overriding for me,&quot; says the 37-year-old mother of two. With quiet finality, she dismisses all the major Democratic candidates: &quot;I could not vote for anyone who doesn't make room for the unborn.&quot;    Catholics, more than a half-million strong and one-fifth the state population, are Iowa's largest religious group. But as Father White and Mrs. Ward indicate, they're a politically schizophrenic group. Some are moving leftward on issues like the farm problem and U.S. policy in Central America -- even as others move rightward on abortion and other social issues. The bottom line is that the Catholic vote is up for grabs; the Democrats no longer enjoy their once-big majority among Catholics, and the abortion issue, which has pulled conservative Catholics into the GOP, now seems likely to divide Republicans within their coming caucuses.    &quot;Nationally, Catholics are the biggest and most volatile swing vote in presidential and senatorial elections now,&quot; says Michael Novak, a resident scholar of religion and public policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank. &quot;They're the major contested vote between the two parties.&quot;    &quot;Iowa Catholics are maybe 55% Democrat and 45% Republican today,&quot; ventures Joseph Gaylord, executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee. &quot;That's about 20 points closer than where we used to be.&quot;    Dubuque, huddled in the cold beneath its Mississippi River bluffs, typifies Catholic volatility. Dubuque County, 64% Catholic and punctuated with the spires of country churches, is a traditional Democratic stronghold. But the stronghold abruptly collapsed in the senatorial campaign of 1978.    That year, angry anti-abortion activists jeered liberal Democratic Sen. Dick Clark at the airport here. The senator, who'd rolled up a 2-to-1 Dubuque County landslide six years earlier, barely edged Republican challenger Roger Jepsen this time -- and went on to lose the state in a stunning upset.    The pattern repeated itself two years later. Democrats Jimmy Carter and Sen. John Culver barely carried this county en route to statewide defeats. Democrats rebounded in 1984, carrying the county for Walter Mondale and piling up a 3-to-2 margin for now-Sen. Tom Harkin, only to be trounced in the Senate race of 1986.    Behind such gyrations, argues the AEI's Mr. Novak, lies an upheaval in the &quot;culture of Catholicism.&quot; He says a &quot;new class&quot; of clergy and lay leaders has come to the fore since Vatican II and the 1960s -- liberal, committed to social justice at home and abroad, oriented toward liberal-style coalition-building. But what he calls the conservative Catholic &quot;silent majority&quot; has reacted by moving to the right.    &quot;The problem Democrats face is that their most enthusiastic support comes from new class activists,&quot; Mr. Novak concludes. &quot;But those are the very people who alienate many of the conservatives.&quot;    Within each party this year, the sheer number of candidates promises to further splinter Catholic caucus-goers. Mrs. Ward, who'll soon help determine the pre-causus endorsement of Iowa's Pro-Life Action Council, sees pro-lifers divided among Robert Dole, Jack Kemp and Pat Robertson. Meanwhile, liberal activists like Father White are all over the lot; he has written off Gary Hart as unelectable, leans toward Jesse Jackson, but would be comfortable with most any other Democrat.    Officially, some bishops try to bridge the liberal-conservative gap by arguing that church teachings are a &quot;seamless garment.&quot; In this view, it's perfectly consistent to oppose abortion and the nuclear arms race at the same time; each threatens life. But the seamless garment tends to rip apart in the world of practical politics.    &quot;The people who work with us on Right to Life are the same people who oppose us on agricultural tax reform and groundwater-pollution control,&quot; says Charles Ryan, Rural Life director for the Des Moines diocese.    And yet, in Father White and Mrs. Ward, there remains a wistful, almost palpable yearning to bridge the liberal-conservative gap. These two Catholics, who know and respect one another, talk with regret of the painful choices that have led them to opposite caucuses.    &quot;This has pulled on me enormously,&quot; says Father White, who, like Mrs. Ward, often wears the red rose of the Right to Life movement. Within a decade, he has walked out of a Democratic state convention after failing to win an anti-abortion fight, registered Republican in protest, then come back to the Democrats again.    &quot;I'm still looking for a group that will be consistently pro-life, for the unborn and the born,&quot; he says quietly.    Maureen Ward, the founding chairman of Dubuque County Right to Life, talks of Irish parents who would &quot;practically choke&quot; on the word Republican. &quot;It would be a wonderful luxury to be able to look at candidates in both parties,&quot; she says.    Interestingly, both Mrs. Ward and Father White admire Mr. Jackson. Born out of wedlock, Mr. Jackson has occasionally reminded audiences that he wouldn't be around had his mother chosen abortion. Nevertheless, he has taken a &quot;pro-choice&quot; position as a presidential candidate, which rules him out for Mrs. Ward.    But ultimately, each of these Catholics yields to the polarizing forces of this election year.    Father White talks of a Democratic White House that would send &quot;ripples of hope&quot; to struggling farmers and the urban poor. He talks of the need to break a conservative &quot;stranglehold&quot; on this country.    Mrs. Ward talks of &quot;20 million lives already gone&quot; since the 1973 Supreme Court decision, and of her decision to subordinate every other issue to her anti-abortion cause. &quot;This,&quot; she says firmly, &quot;is what I do, other than live.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
