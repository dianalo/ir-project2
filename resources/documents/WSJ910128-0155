But amajor complication in the decision is the difficulty inascertaining how effective the air strikes have been.   Commanders of the Third Armored Division, the last majorU.S. ground unit to arrive in Saudi Arabia, said that theirfirst tank-killing Apache helicopters arrived near the frontonly a few days ago. Other helicopters are loaded on a cargoship that had mechanical and crew problems and was forced tomake an unscheduled stop at Malta. In addition, the divisionhas barely one-third of its heavy armor ready for action.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, the &quot;smart&quot; bombs and precision-guided missilesthe U.S is using to try to cripple Iraq's military capabilitywhile minimizing civilian casualties are making it muchharder to figure out how much damage has been done.   The bomb damage analysis, as it is called by the AirForce, will yield answers that are crucial to President Bush.His decisions on when and if to start ground fighting,according to a U.S. official, won't be made until he hasaccurate estimates of how much military strength SaddamHussein has left.   It will be a lengthy and difficult task, according to U.S.officials, to get accurate estimates of bomb damage beinginflicted on Iraqi troops, whose formations and tanks are dugdeeply into the deserts of Kuwait and southern Iraq.   &quot;You can't do bomb damage analysis the way you did in {theVietnam and Korean Wars} by following a line of bombcraters,&quot; said one official here. &quot;Sometimes now, it requiresfinding a relatively tiny hole in a building. That requiresvery sophisticated technology.&quot;   The small holes are caused by bombs such as the GBU 15,which was used over the weekend to hit a crucial piece of aKuwaiti oil pumping installation. The U.S. ordered thebombing to stop the massive oil spill in the Persian Gulf.   Similar weapons are being used to penetrate the thick,reinforced concrete roofs of aircraft bunkers. Following alaser beam pointed by the pilot, the bomb hits a precisepoint on the roof. The bomb makes a hole about a foot indiameter and then, because it has a delayed-action fuse, itpenetrates several feet of concrete before it explodes. &quot;Allyou see is a tiny hole and maybe then some smoke blow out ofa doorway. The plane inside may be incinerated, but how doyou prove it?&quot; said the official, who asked not to beidentified. &quot;To be sure, you'd have to watch what happensaround the bunker for days.&quot;   GBU bombs, which each weigh 2,000 pounds, have beendropped through air vents and windows of fortifiedmilitary-related buildings, leaving the structures intact butpresumably destroying everything inside. Using reconnaissanceaircraft, such as the Phantom RF-4, and satellites, U.S.analysts are comparing before and after photographs oftargeted buildings to spot the often subtle differences.   The bomb damage being done by massive B-52 raids isevident. But it is hard to calculate the extent to whichlayers of sandbags and enemy armor plating can withstand suchpunishment, according to U.S. experts, as long as the Iraqiarmy remains dormant.   Pilots looking down through gaps in the persistent cloudcover that slowed both the bombing and the damage assessmentslast week were amazed by what they saw.   &quot;It's a monstrously big army,&quot; Capt. Jeff Gurney, 32 yearsold, an F-16A bomber pilot later told a pool of reporters.&quot;Basically, when you hit the ground you're going to get thearmy someplace.&quot; He added, &quot;You can see the spots where B-52scame through because B-52s carry a lot of bombs and there isa big long swath of craters.&quot;   Just how long Saddam Hussein's forces continue to playpossum under the air attacks will bear heavily on thecasualties the U.S. will sustain when and if it launches aground attack. Some analysts argue that a ground attack maynot be necessary once the bombing cuts off food and watersupplies to the Iraqi troops.   But ever since the initial euphoria over U.S. bombing ofIraq subsided, U.S. officials have said publicly andprivately that a ground war will probably be required to oustIraq from Kuwait.   &quot;We've always assumed we would eventually have to send inground forces, but we don't want to do it any earlier than wehave to,&quot; Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said yesterday on NBCNews' &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; He added that U.S. forces would beready in &quot;a relatively short period of time&quot; and certainly bythe end of February.   Since the air strikes against Iraq began, commanders herehave repeatedly urged a delay in ordering any major groundaction, saying they need more time to prepare for afull-scale attack. Earlier, some military officials predictedthe troops wouldn't be fully combat-ready until mid-February.   Col. Charles Burke, 45, the Third Armored Division's topaviation officer, said that his pilots want more time topractice night flying and participate in joint training withA-10 jets. &quot;I want to go to war with all my stuff,&quot; he said.&quot;There's no reason for us to rush.&quot;   In addition to delays in getting the division's weaponsinto Saudi Arabia from its home base in Germany, Col. Burkeand many of his fellow commanders cite other reasons forcontinuing the massive bombing campaign.   Saddam Hussein has done a better job than anticipated inshielding his tanks and aircraft by keeping them in concretebunkers and other protective shelters. Military planners hopethat continued bombing will eventually force the Iraqis intothe open. But the lack of an Iraqi response so far makes itunlikely that Baghdad will launch a major offensive. &quot;He doesnot move very well at night,&quot; Col. Burke said, which isexpected to give U.S. forces another edge.   &quot;My impression is that so far, {Iraqi} tanks are simplynot moving&quot; out of concrete shelters and other defensivepositions, Col. Burke said. &quot;It is not working out exactlythe way it was supposed to.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
