Several buildings were damaged in Sunday's temblor but noinjuries were reported, the news agency said.   Tass said the earthquake, which struck at 10:28 p.m. Moscowtime, measured 6.5 on the 12-point Soviet scale.   In Boulder, Colo. Russ Needham, a geophysicist with the U.S.Geological Survey said the quake measured less than 5 on theRichter scale. A temblor of 5 on the Richter scale can causeconsiderable damage.   The epicenter of the earthquake was near Spitak, in northernArmenia, a town that was demolished in 1988, Tass said.   ``Several villages have been damaged,'' Tass said. The newsagency said there was damage to buildings in the towns ofStepanavan and Kirovakan.   Tass said the temblor was also felt in the Armenian capital ofYerevan.
