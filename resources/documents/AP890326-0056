(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Saying it is time to end the ``carnage andhavoc'' caused by assault weapons, the International Association ofChiefs of Police announced its opposition Sunday to the guns'public sale and distribution.   ``It's time we put an end to the carnage and havoc that occurswhenever an assault weapon gets into the hands of the wrongpeople,'' said Charles D. Reynolds, chief of police in Dover, N.H.,and president of the Arlington-based police chiefs' organization.``We need to find a way to keep these weapons out of the hands ofcriminals and misfits.''   The resolution said it defined assault weapons as firearms witha high rate of fire and capacity for firepower such that itsfunction as a legitimate recreational firearm is ``substantiallyoutweighed'' by its possible use to kill and injure people. Thoseinclude the AR-15, Uzi, M-16 and AK-47, the group said.   Reynolds said his group is working with people favoring andopposing gun control ``trying to develop a reasonable position thatwill curb access to these firearms while leaving undisturbed thelegitimate rights of sportsmen and hunters.''</TEXT></DOC>
