In a special one-time offer, the Chinese government isselling state-owned Xinle Wood Furniture Factory to thehighest bidder, Chinese or foreign. Xinle Wood is a furnituremaker that lost a bundle in 1988 and then a bunch more in1989.</LP><TEXT>   There's more. Whoever buys the factory also inherits its33 employees. For life. That's because when you tap into thesocialist system, you must play by its rules. Andstate-employed workers don't get fired, even if there's nowork to do. On a recent afternoon, three of the 33 paidemployees were on the job: two women idly chatting in acorner and a young man hammering nails into some plywood.   Still interested? The successful bidder also can continueXinle Wood's product line. In fact, according to the rules,the winning bidder MUST stick to the stuff that got XinleWood where it is today: cheap desks and wardrobes, and bedframes with headboards sporting two big pink hearts on ababy-blue background.   The offer ends soon, so send in those bids. The governmentof Shenzhen, a Chinese &quot;special economic zone&quot; bordering HongKong, is hoping to pull in roughly $3 million for thefactory.   In addition to Xinle Wood, the government is selling threeother struggling state-owned enterprises. There's Xinle MetalProducts Co., also in the red, and two factories barelybreaking even: Xinle Bedding Supplies and Xinle Sofa Co.   A word of caution: If a bidder's goal is to help hastenthe privatization of China's state-run economy, it's best tokeep that under one's hat. The P-word has become taboo inChina since the lethal suppression of last year's student-ledprotest movement in Beijing.   Nonetheless, the Shenzhen government is touting theplanned sales as a bold new step in China's economic-reformprogram. Guo Weiping, the bureaucrat overseeing the saleoffer, calls it &quot;industrial adjustment.&quot; Put another way, thefour factories' state-run parent, Shenzhen Decoration andamp;Construction Industrial Co., gets to dump a handful of moneylosers.   To date, no U.S. company has made a bid since the saleoffer was announced April 23. But Shenzhen is hopeful. &quot;Wedefinitely welcome U.S. investment,&quot; says Mr. Guo, adding asa tease, &quot;The first companies to jump on such an offer aresure to succeed.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
