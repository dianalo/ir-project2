Gen. Andres Rodriguez, who was Stroessner's second-in-command andwhose daughter is married to Stroessner's son, said in a nationwideradio address the commander-in-chief was under house arrest.   Rodriguez later took the oath as provisional president, thenswore in a nine-member Cabinet that included seven civilians, oneactive general and one retired general.   A message read over national radio and reportedly signed byStroessner said the 76-year-old ruler resigned as president and armycommander.   Sources said the coup occurred after Rodriguez was ordered toresign.   Stroessner, who was the Western Hemisphere's longest-rulingleader, was given 12 hours to leave Paraguay and chose exile inChile, the Roman Catholic station Radio Caritas reported.   In Santiago, Chile, Foreign Minister Hernan Felipe Errazuriz saidno asylum request for Stroessner had been received.   About a dozen bodies of soldiers loyal to Stroessner lay outsidethe headquarters of the presidential guard, and radio stationsreported by military and civilian casualties, but there was noofficial death toll.   Opposition leader Domingo Laino put the death toll at 250.Benjamin Fernandez, of the Roman Catholic station Radio Caritas,said ``there are reports of more than 100 dead'' but that thefigures were ``speculative.''   The gray, colonial-style police headquarters was pockmarked withbullet holes, its windows shattered. Armed soldiers mannedroadblocks in front of the nearby National Palace, which was notdamaged, and at checkpoints throughout the city of 900,000.   Stroessner's arrest followed eight hours of gunfights and cannonfire in the capital's streets between rebel soldiers backed by tanksand mortars and forces loyal to Stroessner. Witnesses reportedseeing 40 to 50 tanks moving through the city streets late Thursdaywhen the uprising began.   ``Order has been re-established, and with it all the human valuesof our entire constitution will be respected,'' said Rodriguez, acareer army officer allied with a faction of the ruling ColoradoParty favoring democratic reforms.   ``I communicate to you that Gen. Stroessner has surrendered andfinds himself in perfect health, deprived of liberty, being shownall human rights, at a residence within the First Army Corps,'' hesaid in the radio broadcast, speaking in a clipped, authoritarianvoice.   Diplomats and political sources said shortly before the coup thatRodriguez, for unknown reasons, apparently was ordered to give uphis command and retire or accept the post of defense minister. Herefused.   The rebellion also followed a dispute within the Colorado Partybetween a militant pro-Stroessner faction and traditionalists whowanted to distance the 100-year-old party from the aging dictator.   Richard Alan White, a senior research fellow at theliberal-leaning Council on Hemispheric Affairs in Washington, saidRodriguez acted ``in order to prevent others, including Stroessner'sson, from seizing power as the aged and sickly dictator was losinghis grip.''   White, who just returned from a trip to Paraguay, said``Rodriguez's talk of democratization and human rights is merely acamouflage for his intention to continue the Stroessner regimen.''   Between cars with tires shot flat, several large bloodstainsdried in the oppressive heat of this tropical city.   ``We're happy the government is gone, but we're sad that peoplehad to die,'' said one woman in the capital. She said the shellingand small arms fire forced her to spend Thursday night in arestaurant.   Radio Itapiru reported that 32 government officials, includingStroessner's long-time private secretary Mario Abdo Benitez, werearrested and being held at a naval base.   A member of the 3,000-man presidential guard, who spoke oncondition of anonymity, said ``there was practically no battle. Theydidn't even ask us to surrender. They just opened fire and battereddown the gates with small tanks.''   In Washington, a senior U.S. official said the United States wasmonitoring the situation. ``We don't like violence, of course, andwe hope that whatever government emerges will embrace democracy.''   Stroessner was the absolute ruler of this landlocked SouthAmerican country since seizing power in a 1954 military coup thatousted President Federico Chavez.   Stroessner was army commander-in-chief, doled out politicalfavors and jobs to his allies, and labeled his opponents Marxistsubversives.   Under Stroessner, Paraguay developed a record of providing refugeto fugitive Nazis, ousted dictators, and drug traffickers. The listincludes Auschwitz death camp doctor Josef Mengele; the oustedNicaraguan dictator, Gen. Anastasio Somoza Debayle; and heroinkingpin Joseph August Ricorde.   A staunch U.S. ally, Stroessner was criticized for human rightsabuses by Washington, and in 1986 the Reagan administration labeledhis government a dictatorship. He has been in poor health sinceprostate surgery five months ago.   Radio reports quoted an infantry division commander, Brig. Gen.Ismael Otazu, as saying the uprising was not ``insubordination but acorrection.''   Col. Dionisio Cabello told March 1 radio he was the new air forcecommander and pledged allegiance to Rodriguez, who is believed to be64 years old.   Infantry divisions in three interior cities _ Villarrica, SanJuan Bautista and Concepcion _ and an air force unit sided almostimmediately with the rebel soldiers, radio reports indicated.</TEXT></DOC>
