SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Communist Party, fighting for itssurvival, today said it fired party boss Erich Honecker to preventcivil war and to correct errors that had plunged the country intosocial and economic chaos.   The latest ringing denunciation of the old regime was read atthe beginning of an emergency congress of the party, which isconsidering radical moves in hopes it will retain some of its powerin East Germany's competitive elections in May.   The congress later released a letter by Honecker in which hesaid he had ``deceived'' himself about the state of the economy andthe mood of the people.   ``I take full responsibility for the situation that hasarisen,'' the ailing, 77-year-old former party chief told partyofficials in the letter, written nearly a month ago. He denied thathe was guilty of corruption or misuse of office.   Most of the 2,750 delegates burst into applause as Honecker, nowunder house arrest, was castigated for failing to heed Mikhail S.Gorbachev's calls for reform. He was blamed for committing errorsthat plunged the country into economic and social crises.   The party report said Honecker had to be ousted Oct. 18 toprevent ``a civil war-like bloody conflict'' with those pressingfor democratic change. It also urged members to analyze pastfailings and criticized the party for failing to stand up to thecorrupt party hierarchy.   It said, however, that the party should bear ``no collectiveguilt'' for the wrongs committed by the disgraced former leaders.   Hundreds of thousands of East Germans took to the streets andtens of thousands fled the country in revulsion of Honecker'shard-line rule in recent months. Despite democratic reforms thathave included the opening of the Berlin Wall, protests havecontinued as investigators have disclosed massive corruption andhigh living among the country's former leaders.   The party has been stripped of its constitutional mandate torule, and more than 700,000 members have quit in recent weeks,dropping party membership to about 1.6 million.   Also today, the Christian Democrats, one of the small politicalparties formerly aligned with the Communists, held its own congressand elected reformer Lothar de Maiziere to head its new drive forpolitical autonomy.      The weekend emergency meeting follows two days in which twomainstays of Communist rule, the party's militia and the hatedsecret police, were ordered dismantled by the government.   In discussing the report on the origins of the crisis, delegateMichael Schumann said Honecker's desire for ``self-promotion''outdistanced the political line he set for the party to follow.   Exposing and punishing those who misused their offices havebecome major themes of Communist reformers trying to win publictrust and support at the polls.   In appeals for order and reason, authorities have disclosedincidents of violence against secret police agents and CommunistParty members, and contended that unrest is mounting at an``alarming rate.''   But East Berlin and other major cities visited in recent days byforeign journalists appeared calm, and Western diplomats withcontacts nationwide suggest the official reports may be overstated.   Under the new party platform, the Communists are seeking toredefine themselves as social democrats. They may also vote todayto change the name of the party to reflect its new direction.   In last week's party congress, Gregor Gysi, a 41-year-oldlawyer, was chosen the party's third leader in less than two months.   Numerous grass-roots reform movements have sprung up this fall,and many of them intend to run candidates in the elections thatwill be the first to present the Communists with any genuinecompetition in more than 40 years.</TEXT></DOC>
