Can dogs think? . . . Am I ugly? . . . Did I floss? . . . Is there truth? . . . Is there any pizza left? . . . Should I buy a vowel? These and other quirky questions have been flashing on TV screens this spring, leaving more than a few people scratching their heads. As the questions appear in scrawled white handwriting on a black background, viewers hear equally mysterious background noises that sound like glass shattering, bombs exploding and children giggling. The commercial finally concludes with the enigmatic sales pitch: &quot;The new Honda Elite 50. If it's not the answer, at least it's not another question.&quot;    Here's one more question: Will anyone buy a Honda motor scooter after watching that commercial? Yes, probably a lot of people will. Offbeat ads have become a trademark for American Honda Motor Co.'s scooters, and the company gives them much of the credit for invigorating what was virtually a dead market in this country. Honda tries to be more provocative each year, and it has outdone itself with the &quot;questions&quot; commercial. &quot;We want to appeal to people who have a youthful attitude and like being different,&quot; says Neil Leventhal, advertising manager for Honda scooters. &quot;That means young people, but it also includes the middle-aged lawyer who would show up at court on a scooter.&quot;    AMERICANS WERE BUYING only a few thousand scooters a year until Japanese marketers -- Honda and Yamaha Motor Corp. -- introduced their models into the U.S. in 1983. Sales quickly took off, zooming to 125,000 scooters a year by 1985. Then sales growth came to a screeching halt last year as the strong yen drove scooter prices up as much as 40%. This year, though, with prices a little more stable, Honda predicts the industry's scooter sales will grow 20% to 150,000.    &quot;Although I find Honda's commercials a little too daring, I give the company credit for raising people's awareness of scooters,&quot; says Steven Sandborg, senior vice president of Abert, Newhoff andamp; Burr, the ad agency for Yamaha scooters. &quot;That's been good for both of us.&quot; Honda claims more than 80% of the market, down a bit from its peak of about 90%. Yamaha has almost all the rest.    While scooters are still a small market, some people doubted consumers would go for them at all. &quot;I thought Americans were too macho for scooters,&quot; says David Bodden, a Honda dealer in Charleston, S.C. Scooter buyers, it turns out, are indeed a special breed. Seldom do they trade up to motorcycles. They're more interested in a fun, inexpensive way to travel than in the power of a motorcycle. Many scooter owners are teen-agers, but older people in urban areas find them handy, too. Says Mr. Bodden, &quot;Scooters are yuppie-ish and cycles are more blue collar. It's a totally different mindset.&quot;    FROM THE START, Honda made its scooter ads more avant garde than its motorcycle commercials. The company's first memorable scooter ad took a kinky approach, showing actress Grace Jones biting rock singer Adam Ant's ear. In 1985, singer Lou Reed took a &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; for Honda. And in one of Honda's commercials last year, Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon clowned for the camera in zany outfits and sunglasses. &quot;Outrageousness!&quot; he said. &quot;It's nothin' more than a way to wake people up, especially yourself.&quot; Not a typical commercial message, but the real surprise came midway through the 30-second spot. Suddenly the commercial began running in reverse, and viewers saw the McMahon routine performed backwards.    This year for a change, Honda isn't relying on personalities to get attention. &quot;Celebrities have become so overused in advertising that their value has been diluted,&quot; says Mr. Leventhal, the Honda ad manager. But Honda probably would have used a famous face again if it could have landed its first choice. Richard Nixon, however, didn't respond to feelers the company put out. What Honda had in mind was an ad in which the ex-president commented on the ease of operating a scooter compared with a tape recorder.    Despite the growth of scooter sales, Honda's unorthodox commercials aren't without skeptics. Honda dealers in the South, for example, griped about the ads featuring Grace Jones, a black woman with an androgynous look. &quot;I'm not sure Honda's far-out ads fit in the Midwest,&quot; comments Bill Romer, an Indianapolis Honda dealer. &quot;I'm always trying to figure out what the hell they're saying.&quot;    EVEN AFTER Honda's advertising executives give their interpretation of the new &quot;questions&quot; commercial, the marketing strategy isn't exactly crystal clear. The questions, they say, represent the scrambled, &quot;left-field&quot; thinking that's typical of the human mind. &quot;There are times when you have to stop asking questions and go do something,&quot; says Mr. Leventhal. &quot;Scooters are an escape from questions. They're also an answer to some questions, although not the ones asked in the commercial.&quot;    Another new Honda ad is slightly less obscure. The camera moves in for a close-up of a scooter as an announcer growls, &quot;If you've got an itch, scratch it.&quot; Translation: Many people fantasize about riding a scooter, and they should act on their feelings.    A third Honda commercial this year features the 1950s rock 'n' roll tune &quot;Who Do You Love&quot; and has the fuzzy, jittery look of home movies as it captures the perspective of a scooter rider whizzing up and down the hills of San Francisco. Honda hopes this spot will broaden the appeal of scooters by putting them in &quot;a more real world context,&quot; Mr. Leventhal says. &quot;Now that people know scooters aren't a funny little toy for nerds, we need to make them more accessible by illustrating the exhilaration of riding one.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
