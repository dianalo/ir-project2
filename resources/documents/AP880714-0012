Maj. Gen. Boris Surikov said Star Wars devices, which theSoviets call ``space strike weapons,'' could ``in the foreseeablefuture be used to destroy strategically important targets on earthand in space.''   ``The current technology also gives the opportunity to startcover deployment of space-to-earth strike weapons even now,'' hesaid in the interview published Wednesday by the British magazineJane's Defence Weekly.   ``Independently of the actual armaments of the U.S.(anti-ballistic missiles) stations, the Soviet Union would assumethat they are armed with weapons able to destroy vital groundtargets within five minutes of a decision to mount a nuclear attackfrom space,'' he said.   Surikov also outlined steps the Soviets could take to outflankStar Wars, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative.   Although Soviet civilians and U.S. critics of Star Wars havemade points similar to Surikov's, the interview provided unusualdetail from a Soviet military source that Jane's described as ``hisgovernment's expert on new types and systems of space-basedweapons.''   Surikov hinted in the article that the Soviet Union mightdestroy such stations soon after they were deployed.   U.S. officials have denied that Star Wars would use nuclearweapons or that other SDI devices, such as high-energy lasers,would be used against targets on earth.   Congress has barred the Reagan administration from spending anymoney that might violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,which places strict limits on missile defenses.   Surikov acknowledged that the Soviet Union ``is engaged inresearch and development to improve the limited ABM system'' aroundMoscow. He said the system was ``fully in compliance with ArticleVII of the ABM Treaty,'' limiting each side to one ABM siteequipped with not more than 100 interceptors.   He also confirmed that the Soviet Union is conducting researchon new weapons systems ``based on other physical principles,'' suchas lasers, at a test site allowed under the ABM pact.   The article appeared as the Reagan administration tries todecide whether to declare the Soviet Union in ``material breach''of the ABM Treaty because it built a radar facility at Krasnoyarsk,deep inside Siberia, instead of near the border as required by thepact.   The Soviets say the Krasnoyarsk radar is designed to trackvehicles in space, but suspended work on it a year ago before itbecame operational.   Surikov did not directly respond to U.S. allegations about thefacility, but said ``all Soviet radars have lower potentials'' thanthe ceiling set in the ABM treaty, ``and cannot detect or trackballistic missiles automatically or with the necessary accuracy.''   The Soviet general also outlined steps that Moscow could take tofoil any strategic defense system built by the United States. Thecountermeasures, all of which have been discussed publicly byWestern experts, include:   _Early destruction or neutralization of orbiting stations by``anti-ABM spacecraft armed with nuclear or conventional charges,''``space mines'' or ``clouds of heavy or lightweight obstacles (likemetal balls, sawdust, sand. etc.)''   _``A build-up of offensive arms'' to present SDI with anoverwhelming number of intercontinental ballistics missiles (ICBMs)to target;   _``Cheap ICBM decoys ... which would greatly overburden thefirst space layer of the ABM defense'' and other ``imitationdevices ... to effectively camouflage the real nuclear warheads.''   _``High acceleration missiles'' designed to release theirwarheads before the launch vehicle could be destroyed by the firstlayer of a space-based defense.   _``Massive deployment of variously based cruise missiles'' or``submarine launched ballistic missiles'' for which ``there are nointerceptors at present.''</TEXT></DOC>
