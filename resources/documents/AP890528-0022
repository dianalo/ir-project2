Such is the dilemma facing the Polish United Workers Party as itprepares for the June 4 elections to parliament, Poland's firstsomewhat democratic balloting since World War II.   The communists are being challenged by a well-organized,emotionally driven opposition led by the newly legalized Solidaritylabor movement. Solidarity, with the luster of novelty and the auraof idealism, is awash in campaign contributions and volunteers.   At a converted coffee house in Warsaw's Constitution Square, theheadquarters of the Solidarity Citizens' Committee, workers almosttrip over each other to get out campaign literature, deliverplacards, sign up poll watchers and instruct citizens on votingprocedures.   A few blocks away, in a state-owned department store, theparty-led coalition's campaign headquarters is almost empty. Onecampaign workers is on duty, his piles of leaflets sitting idle andunread.   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who ordered thecrackdown that led to Solidarity's suppression in 1981 andinitiated the conciliation that resulted in its legalization thisyear, has said the communist party must be prepared to face theelectoral test.   Party spokesman Jan Bisztyga said despite Poland's dire economicproblems, the party can point to some achievements during its 45years in power.   ``We had 45 years of peace. ... At all our borders, we hadfriends. It means something,'' he said. ``We changed the classes inour country. We had a majority of peasants.''   Now, a majority has moved to an urban life, and ``we have a hugeintelligentsia.''   All this took ``tremendous economic, social and politicaleffort,'' he said. ``So it is very unjust to enter the politicalcampaign looking for errors and defeats.''   More important than the past is the future, he said. The partyis campaigning on the premise that it is the best bet for ensuringpolitical and economic reform. Of all the political forces in thecountry, he said, the party is in the strongest position toguarantee that reforms actually will be carried out.   ``To say that the reforms just started now _ it is not true,''he said. ``Always in our party, the communist party, it was a trendto adopt our policy to the actual situation in Poland.''   The party pitches itself as pragmatic and practical, implyingSolidarity is not. Banners around Warsaw say: ``With us, it'ssurer,'' and ``We have a realistic program.''   Missing is any reference to the communist party itself. Insteadof the party's Polish initials, PZPR, posters bear a logo with ared mermaid, a city symbol used by the Warsaw ``coalition'' ofparty candidates and those of allied groups.   At stake in all of this are 460 seats in the existingparliament, the Sejm, and 100 seats in the newly created Senate.The opposition is allotted only 161 seats in the Sejm, with therest reserved for the communists. But the race for the Senate iswide open.   The new system was one of the agreements that came out of twomonths of talks between the government and the Solidarity-ledopposition.   Jaruzelski's regime agreed to the talks after a series ofcrippling labor strikes last year. It is seeking Solidarity's helpin putting in place unpopular measures to overhaul the nation'ssickly economy.   In return, among other things, Solidarity was made legal againand elections were made freer.   The Solidarity Citizens Committee has named just one candidatefor each of the parliament races it can enter.   The party's slate is less clearly defined. For example, thereare more than 30 candidates on the ballot for three Senate seatsfrom Warsaw. Three represent Solidarity, but the party has neverclearly announced which of the others it supports.   Wojciech Szymborski, a party propaganda department employeemanning the coalition's Warsaw campaign center, says that isbecause the party wanted to let the people decide.   Some opposition leaders have suggested the party's strategyincludes trying to confuse voters. Candidate names are to appear onlengthy and complicated ballots with no indication of affiliation.   Although the party has been in power since the reestablishmentof a Polish government after World War II and claims a membershipof 2 million (about 5 percent of the population), it has beentrailing the opposition in opening campaign offices, announcing aplatform and putting up posters.   ``If you are talking about visual propaganda, for certain wewere behind the Solidarity side,'' Szymborski conceded, saying theparty was slower to pick its candidates.   But he said the party is dealing more specifically with theissues.   ``Solidarity first of all is basing its campaign on its name andits sign, and our campaign is more complicated and wider,'' hegrumbled.</TEXT></DOC>
