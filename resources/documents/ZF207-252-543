 When is itethical to copy software?andP;  To share customer lists?andP;  To accept money for faxnumbers?andP;  To accept free hardware and software samples from companies theyevaluate?andM;All of these are very serious ethical issues.andM;The problem with ethics is that they are not earily reduced to a set ofwritten rules.andP;  If you can write an absolute rule about something, you aren'tdealing with ethics, you're dealing with regulations.andM;Ethics, by their very nature, require judgment and as a result involve manyshades of gray.andM;Actually, establishing ethics is a special case of a general problem ofmanagement.andP;  You have a vision of the ethical atmosphere you wish to createin your organization--just as senior management has a vision for the company.andO;One of the most difficult and important tasks for a manager is to articulatethis vision, then to share it with subordinates and obtain their agreementand understanding.andM;No modern corporation would attempt to impart its corporate vision to thestaff with a single speech during training or a single document, signed andforgotten.andP;  The corporations with a viable corporate culture, the ones thatwill win in the 1990s, repeat their corporate vision in many forms, over andover again, until every employee either buys in or quits.andM;Yet PC ethics are often handled quite casually, with a single session duringthe training process or a writeen ethics statement, signed and returned toPersonnel.andM;If this is as much as you want to do, at least make employees sign thestatement annually--and make sure someone checks to see that the statementsare actually signed and returned.andM;This begs the question of whether there should be any written ethics policyat all.andP;  By their nature, reducing ethics to print tends ultimately tooversimplify them.andM;It also allows jailhouse lawyers to say, &quot;But it isn't covered in the code,&quot;while allowing real lawyers (should it come to that) to introduce the ethicscodes in evidence during a trial--sometimes to the detriment of the authorsof the code itself.andM;Despite the risks, I believe a written code of ethics is an important part ofany PC ethics program.andP;  It should be as general as possible.andP;  It should coverconflict of interest, gratuities and piracy.andP;  It should not be written bylawyers (although it might be wise to seek counsel), but by practitioners,and in clear English.andM;It should explicitly state that some situations aren't covered and, if thereare offenses in your company that result in firing, it should name them.andP;  Beprepared, though, to fire people who violate a policy that you so designate.andO;Ask employees to re-read and re-sign this policy every year.andP;  Ignorance ofthe &quot;law&quot; should be no excuse.andM;If your corporation already has an ethics statement, yours should be aspecial case, cross-referenced, couched in PC terms.andP;  If your company doesnot have written ethics, call your local Touche-Ross office and ask for theirexcellent report on the subject.andM;While such a written ethics code is the basis of an ethics program, it mustnot be the alpha and omega, so to speak.andP;  Regular examination of casestudies, drawn from actual experience in your corporation, experiences ofothers or press accounts, should be circulated and discussed.andP;  Do not usesimple case studies; no example should involve a clear, unquestionableviolation of the law.andM;Before the discussion begins, let everyone know that their opinions will notbe held against them.andP;  Otherwise, the discussion will be tame and lame.andM;There are no right and wrong answers in an ethics discussion, just differingopinions on how to apply ethical principles.andP;  When the discussion ends, ifopinions differ widely enough, you might draft new policies, clarifying yourposition as well as the company's.andM;What you'll find is that things you always assumed everyone knew and agreedon are rarely anything of the sort.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
