(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The district attorney says he willinvestigate whether jury tampering occurred in the 1964 trial of awhite businessman in the assassination of Mississippi NAACP leaderMedgar Evers.   ``It could be that it will take a grand jury investigation,'' EdPeters said Monday. The City Council voted last week in favor ofreopening the case.   The council resolution came after published reports said theSovereignty Commission, a now-defunct state panel established in1956 to preserve segregation, screened potential jurors to help thedefense of Byron De La Beckwith at his murder trial in 1964.   Beckwith was tried twice but both trials ended in hung juries.Murder charges against him were dropped in 1969.   Documents show that the Sovereignty Commission described certainpotential jurors as likely to be ``fair and impartial.'' One wasnoted as Jewish and another as having improper ``thinking.''``Fair'' jurors made the final panel; the others did not.   Mere background inquiries by the commission do not constitutetampering, Peters said. A grand jury would look for evidence thatjurors were influenced, he said.   Other legal hurdles remain in the way of reopening the case,including the right to a speedy trial, the district attorney said.   Erle Johnston, former Sovereignty Commission director, said theagency's role in Beckwith's first trial ``was unethical, but itwasn't tampering.''   Evers, an NAACP leader who fought to open white schools to blackchildren, was gunned down in the driveway of his Jackson home.Beckwith's fingerprints were found on the rifle used.   Beckwith, who said during the trial that his weapon was stolen,could not be reached for comment. There is no telephone listing forthe Greenwood businessman in the area.   Evers' widow, Myrlie, now a Los Angeles public workscommissioner, said, ``I'm heartened to know that the interest isgrowing in the possibility of reopening Medgar's case.''</TEXT></DOC>
