As a result of a nine-month U.S. investigation of India'spatent and copyright policies, the U.S. could impose tradesanctions on that country &quot;at any day.&quot; But the Bushadministration deferred a decision on whether to takeretaliatory action because negotiations with New Delhi arecontinuing, a senior U.S. trade official said.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. pharmaceutical industry has complained thatIndia's patent policies deprive it of more than $200 millionin potential sales annually. If the negotiations fail, theU.S. is likely to impose punitive duties on Indian shipmentsof equivalent value.   The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association expresseddismay at the administration's decision to defer sanctions.&quot;There is no country in the world where patent piracy ofvaluable patented medicines has been more rampant orunchecked than in India,&quot; said Gerald Mossinghoff, theassociation's president.   The U.S. is holding back in part because it has gainedwhat appear to be substantial concessions from India oncopyrights. According to the U.S., the Indian government issubmitting legislation that would allow foreign moviecompanies to rent out videos in India. It also would improveprotection for sound recordings. In addition, New Delhi isstarting a program to train police officers and prosecutorsin apprehending video and record pirates.   As another concession to the U.S. movie industry, Indiawill lift quotas and other restrictions on imported films,and it will allow foreign movie companies to distribute theirproducts directly. These measures are to take effect April 1.   At the same time, New Delhi has agreed to let U.S.companies market products in India under their own brandnames. Currently, India requires U.S. companies to marketproducts under the names of joint ventures with Indiancompanies. U.S. trade officials refer to the Indian agreementas the &quot;Let Pepsi Be Pepsi&quot; accord.   U.S. trade officials praised India for raising thestandards of its copyright and trademark protection. But theywarned that the U.S. continues to be concerned about&quot;deficiencies&quot; in India's treatment of pharmaceuticalpatents. Currently, India provides no patent protection forpharmaceutical products; it has offered to extend protectionfor 14 years, but the U.S. is seeking 20-year protection.   Moreover, the U.S. objects to India's practice ofcompelling foreign patent holders to license new drugs theywish to sell in India for production by domesticmanufacturers.</TEXT></DOC>
