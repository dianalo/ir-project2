Whereare all the other companies that prosper from the dollars spent by the Latinocommunity throughout the year?  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LATINO COMMUNITY SHOULD SET EXAMPLE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     I agree with Rodriguez's statement that the fault for alcohol and nicotineaddiction does not lie solely with the alcohol and tobacco industry. This isdefinitely a community and cultural problem.;    We must wake up to the factthat alcoholism creates dysfunctional families who must break the resultantvicious cycle to better themselves. The Latino must realize that getting drunkdoes not make him any more manly and Latinas must acknowledge the devastatingeffect that alcohol has on their unborn children. Drinking does not solve anyproblems, it creates and amplifies them!;    If we want to give our children,and ourselves, the chance to strive to attain our highest potential, we muststart by setting a good example and examining our own behavior.;    -- LorettaCorrales; San Jose;  FISCAL FIASCOES HOLD ECONOMICS LESSONS; A hard economicslesson is being learned by our federal, state and local agencies: You simplyshould not spend more money than you have. This accounting principle ispracticed by most households but has yet trickled up the political ladder.;   Politicians cannot hide behind increasing taxes, additional user fees andrelaxed campaign contribution limits. The bottom line is responsible fiscalplanning and spending.;    -- Carole Rast; San Jose;  PALESTINIANS' HOME STILLIS IN PALESTINE; I must take great exception to Bruce A. Joffe's viewregarding the West Bank and Palestinian self-determination (Letters, May 7).;   Seventy-five percent of the Jordanian population may be Palestinian, asJoffe claims, but this in no way means the world should transform Jordan intoa Palestinian homeland.;    The fact is, Palestinians live as refugeesthroughout the Middle East and the world because they have been driven out oftheir homes by expansionist Zionists since the founding of Israel in 1948.;   Secretary of State James Baker is bravely attempting to change this diresituation. However, he is finding the hard-line Israeli leadershipunrealistically stubborn. It refuses to negotiate with anybody but thePalestinian Uncle Toms and Benedict Arnolds.;    In further defiance of ourefforts for peace, the Israelis continue to build settlements on the OccupiedWest Bank and Gaza. These lands do not belong in what Joffe claims areIsrael's &quot;natural borders.&quot;;    We as Americans should support freedom andjustice everywhere. The homeland for Palestinians is lawfully and rightfullyPalestine, not Jordan.;    -- Suhail A.
