SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Only about half the adults who have a computerat home actually use it as opposed to nearly three-quarters of allchildren, the Census Bureau reports.   Youngsters use computers for learning and for games, and manychildren are also exposed to the machines in school, said bureaustatistician Robert Kominski.   Even though many adults use computers at work, the home computermay have been bought by one adult for a specific use, and not be ofinterest to others in the home, Kominski suggested.   In addition, many computers were bought ``as learning tools andgame machines for children,'' he said. ``So there probably arequite a few situations in households where children use a computerand not the adults at all.''   The report was based on a survey taken in October 1984, the onlytime the bureau has looked at computer use. The report was delayedbecause of other priorities, he said.   Computer use has skyrocketed from the nearly 7 million homecomputers in use at the time of the survey.   International Data Corp., a Boston-based market research group,estimates that the number of homes with computers reached nearly16.5 million as of last year.   Electronic Industries Association, a trade group, estimates thetotal at 17.6 million homes as of January.   While it deals with a time when fewer machines were in use, thecensus analysis is the first detailed look at who owns and uses themachines.   Of 221 million Americans aged 3 and over in 1984, more than onein five _ 21.1 percent _ reported using computers in some directway.   Among children aged 3 to 17, 15.3 percent had a computer athome, and 74.2 percent of those used it. Of those enrolled inschool, 28 percent reported using computers.   Among youngsters, the study found, boys generally use computersmore than girls.   ``If you want to risk saying anything is a socioculturaldifference at this time, that's certainly where it lies,'' Kominskisaid. ``People who study computer games find boys use these thingsmuch more than girls do, they go to video parlors more, and theyuse computers more at home and school too.''</TEXT></DOC>
