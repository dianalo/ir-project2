 As a result of modifications and consolidation, the new edition isless than half the size of the previous one.andP;  Detailed procedures now arelocated in separate handbooks on procurement, facilities design andconstruction and mail transportation procurement.andM;The manual emphasizes only significant policies and procedures.andP;  Instead ofattempting to prescribe every detailed step of the Postal Service procurementprocess, the manual establishes broad guidelines within which eachcontracting officer may operate.andM;Among its most significant changes from former policies, the new manual givescontracting officers and other Postal Service officials greater discretion toexercise business judgment in the course of a procurement.andP;  This changeclosely follows the recommendations of numerous commissions and studies, suchas the Packard, Grace and Califano reports.andM;The new policies replace the position-by-position delineation of contractingofficer authority with a contracting officer warrant system related to theindividual and his capabilities.andM;Additionally, the position &quot;head of procuring activity,&quot; has been eliminatedand delegation of authority and approval has shifted to assistant postmastergenerals.andP;  Membership in the Procurement Policy Committee has been elevatedto the officer level, providing greater visibility and increased authority aswell.andM;These changes reflect a new perception among key Postal Service executives ofthe critical nature of procurement and recognize the procurement field as alegitimate, professional discipline.andM;Another major policy revision affects purchasing methods.andP;  Also reflectingthe recommendations of various studies, the agency is requiring itscontracting officers to consider quality as well as price in competition.andM;The Postal Service has established a policy of obtaining adequate competitionfrom qualified sources, in contrast to the standard federal agency policy ofobtaining maximum competition from all sources, regardless of qualifications.andM;Emphasizing QualityandM;Contracting officers are being given the authority to restrict competition toproducts and contractors of proven quality and reliability throughprequalification procedures.andP;  Requirements now are publicized only insituations where competition is being sought.andM;The policy raises from $25,000 to $50,000 the threshold for publicizingsolicitations in the Commerce Business Daily.andP;  The award of contracts valuedat more than $100,000 with significant subcontracting opportunities, valuedat more than $50,000, also must be announced in the newspaper.andM;The Postal Service also has established a system of national and regionalcontracts and agreements for ordering suplies and services, reducing theadministrative effort of letting individual contracts order and resulting inlower prices.andP;  It also places greater emphasis on multiyear procurements.andM;Officials say they can reduce procurement lead time by letting contractingoffices restrict competition to approved sources or prequalified vendors.andO;Source selection can be made on the basis of price proposals without havingto examine vendor qualifications each time before award.andM;The manner of selecting sources of supply also has been changed.andP;  PreviousPostal Service policy emphasized formal advertising and low-bid contracting.andO;Now the agency has established a single competitive method for solicitingproposals, and contracting officers have the authority to conductnegotiations as appropriate.andM;Replacement of the varied methods with a single purchasing process willgreatly simplify procedures and reduce paperwork.andM;Purchase Ceiling Is RaisedandM;The ceiling for use of simplified purchasing procedures has been increased to$50,000, up from the current $25,000.andP;  In a major departure from federalregulations, those procedures may be used for larger purchases whenappropriate, up to $1 million for the acquisition of standard commercialproducts.andP;  Raising the thresholds will increase the number of procurementseligible for such procedures.andM;The agency also has eliminated mandatory specifications and formally adoptedthe practice of implementing commercial procedures consistent with itsmission and statutory requirements.andP;  Accompanying this new emphasis onobtaining standard and modified commercial products whenever feasible is theagency's requirement to address procurement planning considerations, whichnever before were taken into account.andM;Contracting offices now are required to perform market research to locatequality products and services.andP;  A source selection plan must be developed foreach competitive procurement other than simplified purchases when price andprice-related factors are not the sole basis for evaluation and selection.andM;The new manual also eliminates most printed forms previously used for PostalService procurement in favor of computer-generated formats that can betailored to the requirements of a particular procurement.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
