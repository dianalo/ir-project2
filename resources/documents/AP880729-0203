Attorney Ismail Ayob said he had ``an idea'' of what promptedthe attack but that he had to honor Mandela's request that nostatement be made.   ``Mr. Mandela was not the target, the family was not thetarget,'' Ayob told a news conference after spending the nighttalking to youths in Soweto, a black township oustide Johannesburg.   He said Mandela had sent a message from Pollsmoor Prison sayingthere should be ``no prosecutions, no witchhunts'' for Thursday'sattack on the Mandela home. Mandela, 70, is serving a life sentenceafter being convicted in 1964 of sabotage and plotting to overthrowthe government.   Ayob also disputed a claim by Robert J. Brown, a businessmanfrom High Point, N.C., who said he had been given power of attorneyby the Mandelas to protect their interests.   The attorney said the Mandela family would not file a complaintwith police about the arson attack and would work with communityleaders to try to bring peace and avoid reprisals.   He called ``laughable'' a report that police were investigatingthe possibility that the African National Congress' rival guerrillagroup, the Pan Africanist Congress, may have been involved in thearson.   Ayob would not respond to questions about reports by blackjournalists that teen-agers who guard the Mandela house had beeninvolved in a dispute with students at a nearby high school over agirl. The reports said about 40 youths, including some wearingjackets from the high school, attacked the house after one or morestudents were beaten by members of the group guarding the home.   Ayob said the modest four-room bungalow, in which the Mandelafamily has lived since the 1940s, would be rebuilt and the work wasexpected to take a few weeks.   Mrs. Mandela, her youngest daughter Zindzi, and twograndchildren who lived in the house were away at the time of theattack.   Ayob challenged statements by Brown who, after visiting Mandelain prison, announced that he had been given the power of attorneyto represent the family's interests worldwide and to preventconcerts and other events from being staged in the Mandela name bypeople with no connection to the family.   Brown made the announcement last week outside the prison withMrs. Mandela standing beside him.   Ayob read to the news conference a statement he said had beendictated by Mandela.   It said in part: ``Mr. Robert Brown does not represent theMandela family's interests in any way.'' It said that at the July23 meeting with Brown, Mandela had ``firmly rejected'' thesuggestion that Brown be given power of attorney, and said ``anymatter related to the family would only be dealt with by theAfrican National Congress.''   The ANC is the main guerrilla organization fighting SouthAfrica's white-controlled government.   Ayob said he discussed the issue with Mrs. Mandela Thursdaynight, after her house burned down, and she agreed to the contentsof the statement he released.   However, American publicist Armstrong Williams, a colleague ofBrown, said Mrs. Mandela had called him in North Carolina and askedhim to announce on her behalf, ``It's nonsense what Ayob said.Everything he said was exaggerated.''   The ANC issued a statement from its headquarters in Lusaka,Zambia, supporting Ayob and saying Brown's ``claims are proved asfalse.''   Brown has known the Mandelas for more than two years. He haspaid for their eldest daughter, Zenani, and her husband to attendBoston University.   He said from his Johannesburg hotel room that Mrs. Mandela andZindzi were with him during the discussion with Mandela in theprison cell and Ayob has no one to corroborate his statementpurportedly from Mandela.   Brown said, ``The family asked me to do something. Mrs. Mandelahas asked me to stop the ripoff of the Mandela family name. ... Aslong as the family wants me to do something about that I will dothat with vigor.''</TEXT></DOC>
