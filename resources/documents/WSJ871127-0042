Undergraduate enrollment in computer courses is down nationwide, and fewer students are majoring in the field or indicating they want careers working with computers. Meanwhile, many companies are struggling to fill computer jobs. As a result, the shortage of computer professionals -- which for a while seemed to be easing -- now appears likely to worsen over the next few years, educators and industry officials say.    &quot;As we look into the future and as the level of computer skills that companies need gets higher and higher, we may really bump into some problems,&quot; says Russ Johnson, manager of strategic employment for Digital Equipment Corp., a Maynard, Mass.-based computer maker.    &quot;It doesn't bode well for the country,&quot; says Kenneth C. Green, associate director of a research project by the University of California, Los Angeles, and the American Council on Education that has charted students' declining interest in computer science. &quot;If U.S. industry is serious about becoming more competitive, then producing more computer experts is an important goal.&quot;    The research study, which for 20 years has surveyed college freshmen nationwide on a wide range of topics, found that the percentage who aspired to careers as computer programmers or computer analysts declined by more than half in recent years -- to 3.5% in 1986, the latest figures available, from a high of 8.8% in 1982. The percentage planning to major in computer science fell to 1.9% in 1986 from a high of 4.5% in 1983, outpacing declines in all other scientific areas.    The decline is partly a backlash of the exaggerated expectations students had for computer-science careers in the early 1980s. Back then, the industry was booming, with companies like Apple Computer Inc. becoming stock market phenomena, and their founders rich and famous. Moreover, such success stories were happening amid a general recession. Computer science appeared to be the career of the future, and students signed up in droves.    &quot;Expectations were way too high,&quot; says Michael Simmons, president of the Fidelity Investments unit that handles the mutual fund company's high-tech needs. &quot;Kids entering school a few years ago had visions of becoming the next Bill Gates (Microsoft Corp.'s founder and chairman) or Steve Jobs (Apple's co-founder), 30-year-olds with millions and millions of dollars.&quot;    Moreover, the computer industry had &quot;developed an aura of invincibility,&quot; says Mr. Green, since it had boomed just as the rest of the economy stalled in 1982-83. &quot;It made computers seem recession-proof.&quot;    But in 1985, when computer-science enrollments were peaking, the industry entered its first slump. The notion that the field was economically fail-safe quickly disappeared as businesses tightened their capital spending and as consumers slowed their personal-computer buying spree. &quot;Suddenly everything turned around,&quot; Mr. Green says.    The demand for computer-science graduates, however, slowed only slightly during the slump. &quot;Students are reading the headlines (about the computer industry's recent problems) but not the want ads,&quot; says Thomas Costello, vice president for information sciences at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell. Although the industry began to rebound earlier this year, educators say they haven't seen a turnaround in student interest in computer science.    Many companies now say they can't find enough qualified people to fill computer jobs. High-tech recruiters for about 40 Southwest companies, for instance, have found the pickings so slim that they meet regularly in Dallas to trade names of prospects.    Average starting salaries for computer science graduates have increased 15% in the past five years, to $26,364 in 1987. Although the salaries haven't increased sharply in recent years, that's likely to change soon, as the supply of qualified job candidates shrinks. Betty Vetter, executive director of the Commission on Professionals in Science and Technology, which keeps track of job statistics in the sciences, says she expects &quot;severe shortages&quot; of computer scientists in the 1990s, &quot;which should drive salaries up quite a bit.&quot;    Meanwhile, students' attitudes toward the field have changed greatly since the boom days. &quot;When I first got here in 1983 it was total chaos,&quot; says Randy Littlefon, a University of Michigan senior majoring in computer science. &quot;The beginning classes were absolutely packed with students.&quot; But many didn't have an accurate idea of what lay ahead. &quot;The first thing people thought of when they thought of computers in 1983 was video games. You quickly learn that's not what it's all about. There's a lot of theory and a lot of math involved.&quot;    Robert Stegall, who recently graduated from the University of Texas in Austin, agrees: &quot;Everyone was saying computers would rule our lives in the year 2000, and I wanted to know what the fuss was about.&quot; He started in computer science but balked at some hard-core calculus courses, and finally switched to business.    Students' declining interest in computer science has had at least one benefit: It's relieved the pressure on overcrowded computer-science departments. At Purdue University, the biggest computer classes have shrunk to 40 or 50 students from more than 100 a few years back. Computer-science enrollment at Cornell University has fallen 25% from three years ago. The faculty &quot;welcomed the drop,&quot; says David Gries, a computer science professor at Cornell.    &quot;There's natural evolution operating here,&quot; says John Rice, Purdue's computer-science department chairman. &quot;Now that the glamour has worn off a bit, things can get back to normal. Better students, if not more students, may be the result.&quot;    That improvement would please some industry officials even more than an increase in the number of graduates. Mr. Simmons of Fidelity Investments says some schools &quot;develop kids in an academic vacuum, and the air is mighty thin. We have to spend some time detoxing them and getting them back to reality.&quot; He figures it takes 12 to 18 months before new employees fresh from computer-science programs reach &quot;payback -- the point at which their work earns their salary for the company.&quot;    At Electronic Data Systems Corp., the data-processing unit of General Motors Corp., 38% of the company's recruits have computer-science degrees. Of the rest, many have engineering and other scientific degrees, and a handful are liberal arts grads. No matter the background, all new employees must take the company's own rigorous 10-week course in computer programming and analysis.    &quot;I'd love to have more students with degrees in finance or anthropology or political science,&quot; says Stuart Reeves, EDS vice president in charge of recruiting and development, adding that being able to think critically is more important than a computer-science degree. &quot;We'll teach them what they need to know to be a computer professional.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
