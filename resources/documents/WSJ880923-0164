Mom and pop investors can't buy the product, but it could benefit their pensions from government or private employers. Such products have a hidden risk, however, as they easily can be terminated, leaving investors in the lurch and forcing them to look elsewhere for the same return.    For accounts of $50 million or more, Boston-based New England will guarantee that its new Enhanced Core Separate Account will provide a minimum annual return equaling the Salomon Brothers Broad Investment Grade Bond Index.    This index returned only 2.6% last year, when the investment-grade bond market showed the worst returns since the early 1980s. In recent years, however, the portfolio on which the index is based provided double-digit income.    So far, only a handful of insurers, including Prudential Insurance Co. of America of Newark, N.J., and Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co., Newport Beach, Calif., sell anything resembling New England's new investment vehicle. But pension consultants say more similar investment vehicles are likely as competition grows among money managers to at least match the performance of benchmark bond indexes.    Still, the vehicle is so fresh that analysts contend it hasn't been tested long enough to prove its long-term value. &quot;We haven't met with any firms that have been managing this product for a while,&quot; said Randy Burge, a research associate at pension consultants Frank Russell Co. &quot;We're open-minded about it, but we haven't yet formed an opinion.&quot;    At Wilshire Associates, another major pension consultant, analyst Howard Perlow said, &quot;We wouldn't want to make a judgment about whether it's an attractive investment vehicle.&quot;    Back Bay Advisers, an investment unit of New England, hopes the guarantee of matching the Salomon index and prospect of beating it will lure tax-qualified pension, profit-sharing and government plans with assets of at least $50 million.    In 1987, Back Bay managed a 3.84% return on a $200 million fund modeled on the &quot;enhanced core&quot; strategy for New England. That amounted to 1.24 percentage points more than the Salomon index. So far this year, the fund is returning 0.68 percentage point more than the index.    &quot;We figured a lot of people concluded that index managers outperformed {conventional} bond managers,&quot; said Anthony J. Wilkins, senior vice president at Back Bay and a member of the investment committee of the Massachusetts retirement system. &quot;So we decided to combine the attractive features of a passive manager with the best features of an active manager.&quot;    Back Bay has beaten the Salomon index by matching the duration and call protection of the index and then substituting higher-yielding, similarly rated securities for those currently in the index. For instance, three-year Treasury bonds yielding 9% could be replaced with triple-A-rated corporate bonds yielding 9.5%, said Mr. Wilkins. The substitutes could include an array of fixed-income securities ranging from collateralized mortgage obligations to Eurodollar bonds.    Back Bay also figures its fees for such service are competitive. Fees on index funds -- investments that do nothing but match a specified portfolio -- range from 0.04 to 0.14 percentage point on the amount invested. Fees on so-called actively managed funds generally are much higher. Back Bay charges 0.10 point. It also keeps 35% of any amount by which the yield exceeds the index, up to a maximum of one percentage point.    As an annual benchmark, &quot;we would hope to be returning more than 0.3 percentage point above the index,&quot; said Mr. Wilkins.    Such funds, however, may contain unperceived risks.    &quot;The first question a pension plan sponsor should learn is the structure of the insurance company's guarantee,&quot; said Mr. Burge of Frank Russell. &quot;It better be ironclad.&quot; New England's guarantee is, said Mr. Wilkins.    Additionally, &quot;there's an implicit reinvestment risk&quot; in the Back Bay fund, said Mr. Burge. &quot;No insurance company is going to maintain an indefinite relationship {that} performs poorly. If the insurance company terminates the relationship and the fund, investors are left suddenly having to find an alternative that isn't available,&quot; he added.    Back Bay, which manages more than $4 billion, doesn't view this risk as a hurdle for luring customers. &quot;Reinvestment risk is the only variable a pension fund should be concerned about,&quot; said Mr. Wilkins. &quot;But it's not a negative one. At worst, the pension fund would just lose the upside potential&quot; of matching or beating the index. &quot;It would still get its money back.&quot;    Some investment bankers say the Back Bay fund is just the beginning of a slew of insurance company-backed quasi-index funds to come. &quot;There are a lot more behind this one,&quot; said Richard Leahy, a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
