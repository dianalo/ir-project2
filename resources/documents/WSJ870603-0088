No contest. The second one is her favorite, and the reason is simple. &quot;It's Pepsi,&quot; she explains to an interviewer. &quot;I guess I'm just used to the taste.&quot;    She sips the first one again and ranks it last. Wrinkling her nose, she pronounces it &quot;Coke Classic.&quot;    After the test, Miss Strednak doesn't even ask about the results of her blind taste test; the whole thing was so obvious.&quot;I can't drink Coke,&quot; says the 16-year-old. &quot;It gives me a headache. It doesn't quench my thirst. It has an aftertaste. I have Pepsi with everything.&quot;    In fact, Miss Strednak has gotten it all wrong. Her favorite was actually Coke Classic. She wasn't even given Pepsi during the test. She is dismayed. &quot;No!&quot; she shrieks, slapping her forehead in disbelief. &quot;Are you sure? Oh, that is horrible.&quot;    If it's any consolation, she has a lot of company. In this taste test, recently conducted for The Wall Street Journal, fully 70% of the 100 taste tasters were mistaken about what they were drinking.    In the cola wars, the taste test is the ultimate Big Gun, and it has changed the course of soft-drink history. Pepsi hauled it out to fire the Pepsi Challenge at Coke in 1975, and it was Pepsi's consistent superiority in taste tests that is widely believed to have pushed Coca-Cola in 1985 to change its formula.    That monumental and widely derided formula switch was itself based on the taste test -- 190,000 or so of them, in which the smoother and sweeter-tasting new Coke consistently beat the old. It also was amazingly popular among Pepsi drinkers.    But the consumer rebellion that followed the introduction of the new Coke formula two years ago, which led the company to reintroduce its old formula as Coca-Cola Classic, was enough to shake the whole premise underlying the taste test: that taste counts.    Nonetheless, Coke and Pepsi are at it again. Coca-Cola is pitting new Coke against Pepsi. PepsiCo Inc. is pitting Pepsi against Coca-Cola Classic. And to try to get to the bottom of all this, we decided to pit all three against each other in our own taste test a few weeks ago.    Marketing Spectrum Inc., an Atlanta-based marketing and research-consulting firm, was hired to conduct the test of 100 people. That sampling is too small to be statistically accurate for the population at large. Even so, taken just as a snapshot of 100 people in the Monroeville Mall just east of Pittsburgh a few weeks ago, the exercise still proved pretty illuminating.    Headquarters for the test was the Truxell's Opinion Center, a little storefront marketing firm between a coin shop and a barber shop in the mall. For a test like this one, the center dispatches a small army of soft-spoken but persistent elderly ladies wearing irresistibly sweet smiles and buttons that say &quot;Your Opinion Counts.&quot; With clipboards in hand, they scour the mall for qualified participants -- in this case, sugar-cola drinkers over age 13, and who, like jurors, don't know too much (that is, don't work for the media, market-research firms or soft-drink makers). In addition, they were looking for equal numbers of Pepsi, new Coke and Classic drinkers.    That proved to be impossible. Out of 450 mall patrons surveyed by the researchers, only two were drinkers of new Coke.    Those picked to be tested included 52 self-declared Pepsi drinkers, 46 Coke Classic drinkers and two new Coke drinkers. And another thing that seemed impossible actually came to pass: By an ever-so-slim and unscientific margin, the winner was -- new Coke. It got 41 votes, Pepsi got 39 votes and Coke Classic got 20 votes.    No one was more surprised than the people tested, many of whom get a little defensive, even surly, when told they don't know their Coke from their Pepsi. &quot;I prefer a bottle or glass,&quot; sniffs Lee Carter, a Greyhound bus driver, by way of explaining why he ranked Pepsi ahead of Coke. The plastic cups, he insists, affect the taste. The owner of a Greensburg, Pa., video store added accusingly: &quot;They must've been shaking the bottles up.&quot;    Not true. In fact, fresh cans were popped religiously for each round to ensure an equal amount of fizz. That is just one of a host of generally accepted taste-test principles. The cola, for instance, has to be chilled to a crisp 32 degrees Fahrenheit and filled to the same level in each cup, which is to be clear plastic. Even the air must be pure and free of smoke and odors.    Sometimes this testing can get pretty sticky. It would be much easier to describe this, for instance, if each participant could have simply been served three cups, each containing one of the three choices. But that, insisted Marketing Spectrum, would have left the whole thing too subject to guesswork and the laws of probability.    So instead each participant was given four cups. Two contained one type of one cola. Two contained one type of a second cola. They were asked to taste each, rank them in order of preference, and then identify a first choice. Everything rotates -- from the positioning of the cups to the cola choices, so equal numbers of Pepsi and Classic drinkers have about equal opportunities to choose new Coke, Pepsi and Classic. And the results give a good indication of why Coke and Pepsi are tempted once more to rely on the old taste test. New Coke, indeed, tricked a lot of die-hard Pepsi drinkers. It got 10 out of 16 who were choosing between it and Pepsi.    And it got 15 out of 19 who were choosing between it and Coke Classic.    And as for Pepsi, its performance indicates why it would have the nerve -- after all the pandemonium over Coca-Cola Classic -- to take that drink on in a taste test. When pitted against Coca-Cola Classic, it seduced nine of 15 Classic loyalists while hanging on to 15 of 17 Pepsi drinkers.    One problem with taste tests, though, is they can be rigged -- by little things. Just to see what would happen, Marketing Spectrum gave each taste-test participant a second round of drinks containing a variable. When the cola was warmed to 38 degrees, 22 of 25 people changed their choices. When ice was added, all but four changed their choices. Styrofoam cups didn't matter much; they confused only 8 people out of 25. But none of the changes followed any pattern.    Another problem with taste tests is there is no accounting for image. Terry Schuffert says it won't make a whit of difference that he picked Pepsi as his first choice. &quot;I won't lower myself to drink Pepsi,&quot; says the 22-year-old engineer and Coke Classic enthusiast, whose excuses for the mistaken choice range from his bad sense of smell, worse sense of taste, and the fact that he'd rather gulp something down &quot;than let it sit and rot in my mouth.&quot; Why won't he drink Pepsi? &quot;It is too preppy. Too yup. The New Generation -- it sounds like Nazi breeding. Coke is more laid back.&quot;    Leonard McFadden, on the other hand, won't drink Coke despite his test results. &quot;I relate Coke with people who just go along with the status quo,&quot; says the 26-year-old highway-department worker. &quot;I think Pepsi is a little more rebellious and I have a little bit of rebellion in me.&quot;    Some taste-test participants think this all is much ado about nothing. Take Ruth Hrizo, a 48-year-old Monroeville resident who picks her cola based on the latest coupons. &quot;When there are so many big problems out there in the world,&quot; she says, &quot;how can people get so concerned about a brand of cola?&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Passions Heating Up as the Summer Nears; Is Headroom Passe?&quot; -- WSJ June 3, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
