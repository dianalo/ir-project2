In the first major economic adjustments since the so-called Bresser anti-inflation plan was launched June 12 with a wage-and-price freeze, the government set a ceiling on salaries for state employees, prohibited most new loans by state credit agencies, barred any wage rises in the state sector that exceed inflation and said further subsidized credit wouldn't be granted to farmers.    The government didn't give a figure for the savings expected from these moves. But it is striving to ensure that this year's deficit is cut to 3.5% of Brazil's total output of goods and services from the 6.5% that appeared likely earlier in the year. This involves cuts of about $8 billion.    The 3.5% target was set by Mr. Bresser Pereira when he announced the current anti-inflation program. But since then, a 28.8% rise in the money supply in June, a series of subsidized state loans to troubled small and medium-sized businesses, and disclosures about huge salaries in the state sector have raised doubts about whether promised austerity was being applied.    At the same time, the official statistics office has indicated that August inflation will exceed 6%, almost double last month's rate and the target for this month set by President Jose Sarney. This figure has caused widespread concern at a time when the delicate process of easing the two-month-old price freeze scarcely has been broached. &quot;It looks like we're heading for 10% a month by October&quot; said former Finance Minister Ernane Galveas. Inflation peaked at 26.06% in June.    Last year's Cruzado anti-inflation plan, which also imposed a wage-and-price freeze, is widely viewed as having ended in disaster because accompanying measures weren't adopted to hold down the federal deficit, and because the freeze was maintained too long. With Brazil in the seventh month of a moratorium on $67 billion of its foreign debt, there is widespread international concern over whether the current program can rectify these mistakes.    The latest measures set a ceiling of about $3,300 a month for salaries in the state sector. This sum, equivalent to 80 times Brazil's minimum salary, is well below the current wages of many state employees who have become popularly known in recent months as &quot;maharajas&quot; because of their huge salaries. In Sao Paulo state, one retired military police officer was recently found to be earning more than $16,000 a month.    Further curbs include a ban on new loans by state credit agencies to state-owned companies, state governments and municipalities. States and municipalities also have been barred from incurring any new debt through the issuing of bonds or other financial instruments. Moreover, financing won't be conceded to any ministries, state companies or other federal bodies exceeding their budgets. &quot;This,&quot; said Mr. Bresser Pereira, &quot;is a question of life and death.&quot;    The deficit repeatedly has been singled out by the International Monetary Fund and foreign creditor banks as a chief cause of Brazil's high inflation and other economic problems. But attempts to curb it have been diluted and will now again face the resistance of recently elected state governors who have promised ambitious social programs for their myriad poor or destitute constituents. </TEXT></DOC>
