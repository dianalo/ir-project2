Authorities are considering publishing the woman's photograph toalert her sexual partners, who were mostly foreigners, the labornewspaper Trud reported. The 29-year-old woman died Sept. 5 ofpneumonia following a 26-pound weight loss, chronic tonsillitis andbronchitis, Trud said.   All are common symptoms of acquired immune deficiency syndrome,and the newspaper said epidemiologists were angry that the woman'sdoctors failed to diagnose AIDS before she died.   Soviet officials say they have identified 83 carriers of theAIDS-causing virus but only one person who has developed the deadlydisease. However, they say other cases may have been diagnosedincorrectly.   The AIDS victim was registered as a night school student and asa factory worker, but police said she earned her living as aprostitute, the report said.   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spreadmost often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared bydrug abusers, and infected blood or blood products. Pregnant womencan also infect their offspring.</TEXT></DOC>
