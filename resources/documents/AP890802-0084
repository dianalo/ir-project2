(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The crew of the nuclear submarineTennessee, thwarted last week by anti-nuclear protestors, launcheda Trident 2 missile today in the first successful underwater testof the Navy's newest, deadliest weapon.   The Tennessee was cruising about 50 miles off Cape Canaveralwhen the 44-foot Trident 2 burst to the surface, ignited andpropelled a dummy warhead package far down the Atlantic trackingrange.   The Navy announced several minutes after the 11 a.m. firing thatthe test flight was a success. A Navy statement provided no details.   The results were in sharp contrast to the Trident 2's firstsubmarine launch on March 21 when the missile pinwheeled out ofcontrol and exploded four seconds after it was launched from theTennessee.   Investigators traced the problem to a mechanical linkageresponsible for moving the rocket nozzles back and forth. Thesystem was redesigned.   The test had been scheduled last Friday but was halted when twolarge Greenpeace U.S.A. ships sailed into the launch danger zone ininternational waters. Two small motorized rafts dispatched from oneof the ships buzzed the submarine and crew members attached three``nuclear free seas'' banners to it.   The Greenpeace vessels did not return today. Protest officialssaid last week they had made their point by stopping the launch andcalling attention to their cause.   The launch today was one of about eight underwater tests plannedover the next few months. If all goes as planned, the Navy willdispatch the Tennessee on patrol in March with 24 of thenuclear-tipped missiles.   Each of the $23.7 million missiles is designed to hurl up to 10nuclear warheads to different targets more than 4,600 miles away.   The Navy had hoped to have the Trident 2 operational late thisyear, but that was delayed by the March explosion.</TEXT></DOC>
