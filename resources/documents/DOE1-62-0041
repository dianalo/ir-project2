<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-62-0041 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new chemical treatment for hazardous waste applications has been developedand found successful in an actual field application. Soils generatingleachable lead concentrations in the range of 200 to 300 mg/l using theCalifornia WET procedure (which is far more stringent than U.S. EPA'sExtraction Procedure Toxicity test) were subjected to treatment and subsequentlyre-tested for lead. Test results show the leachable lead concentrationsin the treated material were reduced to only 2 to 4 mg/l (the Californiastandard is 5 mg/l). In one case, a sample having a concentration of2,300 mg/l was reduced to 10 mg/l lead with only a modest increase intreatment. The cost of the treatment is in the range of $15 to $20 perton. This chemical treatment is based on the use of a proprietary silicate-basedsystem in combination with a cementitious fixative, such as lime, whichgenerally does not result in substantial volume increases, as is typicalwith traditional fixation and stabilization approaches.</TEXT></DOC>
