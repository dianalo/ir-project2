Brown, chairman of Central PointSoftware Inc. of Beaverton, Ore., expressed concern that the directive couldbe more restrictive than U.S.andP;  laws in areas neither association hasmentioned.andM;As examples, Brown cited prohibitions on software rental and the lack of anyprovision that would allow users to make backup copies of software, which isspecifically permitted under U.S.andP;  law.andP;  Of particular concern, Brown said,is the portion of the Software Directive that would prohibit making,importing, possessing or dealing with articles intended to remove copyprotection.andM;&quot;In the United States, copy protection went away because it was ineffectiveand users didn't like it.andP;  If it were made effective in Europe, by means oflaw, it wouldn't go away,&quot; said Brown.andM;Apple's Burger attributed the recent flurry of activity surrounding theSoftware Directive to heightened awareness of the issues among developers.andO;He said the industry is concerned about precedents that could affect theupcoming General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs Trade Round on IntellectualProperty.andP;  That meeting, at which government representatives will setstandards for international trade policies and tariff regulations, will takeplace later this year.andM;&quot;If Europe adopts the aberrations from current copyright law, we'll be in adifficult negotiating position relative to Third World countries' laws,&quot;Burger said.andP;  He added that the lack of sufficient legal protection coulddelay development of software markets in those countries by years.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
