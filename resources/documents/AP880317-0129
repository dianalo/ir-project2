A record crowd of 300,000 people, including thousands ofAmerican tourists, thronged the three-mile parade route from St.Stephen's Green to O'Connell Street, the main thoroughfare.   Many adorned their lapels with sprigs of shamrock, the wildclover that is Ireland's national emblem.   About 6,000 people took part in the parade of dancers, marchingbands and historic-theme floats. Skies were overcast but the rainheld off.   March 14-20 was designated St. Patrick's Week in honor ofIreland's patron saint and Dublin's millennium celebrations, withdaily displays of Irish folk music, dance and street theater.   In Northern Ireland, St. Patrick's Day celebrations were heavilyovershadowed by Wednesday's outbreak of sectarian violence, when aProtestant gunman shot and threw grenades at Catholic mournersburying three Irish Republican Army guerrillas in Belfast. Threepeople died and 68 were wounded.   Mourners wearing shamrocks and green armbands attended thefuneral Thursday of a slain IRA guerrilla a day after the bloodbathat Milltown Cemetery. The service was peaceful.   The violence had little visible impact on the Dublin parade. Itwas a day to set aside thoughts of an unemployment rate near 18percent, high taxation and an emigration outflow estimated at30,000 a year.   Prime Minister Charles Haughey reviewed the parade from a standoutside the General Post Office where rebels launched the EasterRising of 1916 against British rule.   Organizers said crews from more than 80 TV stations in theUnited States and Canada photographed the parade.   Government offices, schools, banks and most businesses wereclosed in the south, but many industries, offices and departmentstores stayed open in Northern Ireland, where the majority isProtestant and doesn't regard St. Patrick's Day as a nationalholiday.   The Irish also took a somewhat bemused look at how the UnitedStates celebrates March 17.   ``There's a bar in West 39th Street that is advertising liveleprechauns and bagpipe music tonight. ... There's even a Jewishdelicatessen on 47th Street offering Irish bagels,'' marveled theIrish Times correspondent in New York, Eugene McEldowney.   In Dublin, botanist Charles Nelson remarked: ``We tend to thinkof the Americans as being a bit eccentric in this regard.''   Some U.S. customs seemed to be catching on here. An Americanhamburger chain was selling ``shamrock-flavored'' shakes.   Roman Catholic churches were full for morning Mass, and laterthe pubs filled up for celebrations.   Some Irish newspapers marked the day by editorializing about itin Irish, or Gaelic, which is the country's first officiallanguage, although only a minority are fluent in it.   The Irish Independent, editorializing in English, wondered whatSt. Patrick, the 5th century missionary who Christianized Ireland,would think of the country were he to return.   ``As a missionary he would have to come to the conclusion thatthe faith he worked so hard to spread here has come on bad times.There are plenty of churches but they are not always packed. Thereare many people who call themselves Christian but may not beentitled to do so,'' it said.   And if he went to Northern Ireland where he lived as a youngman, ``what would he make of the violence, hate and bigotry?'' thepaper asked.   But it also noted that he would find a worldwide Irish diasporawho ``carried with them into exile an attitude to life which wasfashioned basically by what Patrick taught our ancestors 1,500years ago. That is a plus.''</TEXT></DOC>
