But volume was light; only 70 million shares changed hands on the Nasdaq National Market System, and just 94 million traded on Nasdaq.    The big paper, telecommunications and semiconductor stocks rose yesterday, recouping some of their Friday losses. But prices of the big retail and biotechnology shares fell, some giving up more than Friday's gains.    Genentech, the biggest OTC biotechnology issue, fell 1 1/4 to 38; LyphoMed was off 3/8 to 14 1/8. Among the retailers, Charming Shoppes was off 1/2 to 12 1/8; Safecard Services fell 1/4 to 6 7/8.    The big computer stocks and bank stocks, the largest Nasdaq groups, generally rose in price yesterday, as they did Friday. Apple Computer was up 3/4 to 36 1/2; Microsoft, the biggest OTC software issue, was up 1/4 to 47 3/4, and Lotus Development rose 1 to 25.    The Nasdaq composite rose 0.20% to 313.13; but the National Market System Industrials rose a slightly heftier 0.35% to 119.80. The big institutionally traded issues are best reflected in the NMS industrial index.    Several groups held back gains of the composite index. Most insurance stocks slid a bit yesterday. American National Life was off 3/8 to 24 3/4; Ohio Casualty slipped 1/2 to 38. And while bank stocks rose, the general gains weren't as substantial as those of the big, institutionally traded industrial issues.    The biggest gains yesterday were on the American Stock Exchange, which has generally moved with the Nasdaq prices since the crash more than the New York Stock Exchange average. In the past, prices on the Amex -- which includes largely secondary stocks similar to those on the National Market System -- performed somewhere in between the NYSE and Nasdaq averages.    The makeup of the big secondary stock groups on the Amex and on Nasdaq, however, are significantly different. Few bank stocks trade on the Amex, for example, and only a handful of computer and technology stocks trade there. And the Amex has fewer very tiny stocks.    Typically, the Amex has fewer but larger oil-exploration stocks than Nasdaq and three integrated oil companies, while none trade in the over-the-counter market. Yesterday Imperial Oil, the biggest oil stock on the Amex, rose 1 1/8 to 39 1/8. Texaco Canada was up 3/4 to 20 1/2.    In addition, the biggest NMS gold mining company, Echo Bay Mines, with a market value of nearly $3 billion, recently moved to the Amex. It was up 1 3/8 to 20 1/4 yesterday. Several large gold stocks also showed good gains in Nasdaq trading yesterday, but they don't count in the Nasdaq indexes. The biggest were South African gold stocks, such as the $500 million market value American depository receipt for Vaal Reefs Exploration, which rose 7/8 to 10.    But Nasdaq has more and bigger broadcast stocks, which generally did well yesterday. Scripps-Howard, an OTC issue recovering from a pounding when it had to take a $16 million charge against earnings earlier this month, jumped 3 to 76 1/2 in Nasdaq trading yesterday. And LIN Broadcasting, with some $2 billion in market value, also rose 3/8 to 39 in Nasdaq trading yesterday. Turner Broadcasting, with $1 billion in market value, is the biggest broadcasting stock on the Amex. It was unchanged yesterday at 10.    The indexes are weighted to reflect the market value of the individual stocks -- so big ones count more. Thus, when Worlds of Wonder, the beleaguered toy company that makes Laser Tag, rebounded 5/16 to 3 1/4 yesterday, it contributed little to the Nasdaq composites as all of Worlds of Wonder's stock has a value of $72 million in a market of more than 4,800 stocks. In contrast, when Hasbro rose 1/4 to 12 yesterday on the Amex, the effect may have been greater as Hasbro has a $500 million market value, and fewer than 900 stocks go into the Amex composite. </TEXT></DOC>
