DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   From copyrights to civil rights, Congress hasoverridden nine of the 63 vetoes President Reagan has exercisedsince he took office in 1981.   This gives Reagan a better batting average than his lastRepublican predecessor, President Ford but not as good a one asPresident Carter, who had Democratic majorities in both houses ofCongress.   Ford, with the opposition party controlling both the House andSenate, sent up 66 vetoes and had 12 of them, or 18 percent,knocked down.   Carter vetoed 31 bills and had only two of them overridden, wellunder 10 percent.   Counting Tuesday's override of his civil rights bill veto,Reagan has struck out 14 percent of the times he has used hisconstitutional power to disapprove legislation.   Reagan has faced Democratic control in the House throughout hismore than seven years in office. The Senate, however, was underRepublican control from 1981 until last year.   It takes a two-thirds majority of both houses to overcome apresidential veto.   Records of the White House executive clerk's office show thatfive Reagan vetoes have been sustained. In the other 49 cases, thequestion of an override was not put to a vote.   Once, Reagan squeaked through by one vote. That was on June 5,1986, when the Senate sustained a presidential veto allowing aweapons sale to Saudi Arabia to proceed. The count was 66-34, justshy of the 67 votes needed for a two-thirds majority with allsenators voting.   On another occasion, it took nearly eight months to round up thevotes to block the House from overriding the president's veto oftrade legislation curbing textile, apparel and shoe imports. Reaganvetoed the bill on Dec. 17, 1985. The House put off action untilnext year and it was not until Aug. 6, 1986, that it voted. Thecount was 276-149, or eight votes short of the two thirds needed tooverride.   Tuesday's House and Senate votes marked the 101st time in U.S.history that a presidential veto has been overridden. There havebeen 2,452 vetoes, beginning with the administration of GeorgeWashington.   Andrew Johnson had the worst veto record in history. Thepost-Civil War president vetoed 29 bills and was overridden 15times.   The bills previously put into law over Reagan's veto were:   _An act to amend the manufacturing clause of the copyright law,vetoed July 8, 1982.   _A $14.2 billion supplemental appropriation for the fiscal yearending Sept. 30, 1982, vetoed on Aug. 28, 1982.   _An act authorizing a transfer of federal land in Lane County,Ore., vetoed Oct. 19, 1983.   _An act to authorize continuation of a program of waterresources research, vetoed Feb. 21, 1984.   _An act revising authorization laws governing the NationalInstitutes of Health and National Research Institutes, vetoed Nov.8, 1985.   _An act providing economic sanctions against the white minoritygovernment of South Africa, vetoed Sept. 26, 1986.   _The Water Quality Act of 1987, a $20 billion anti-pollutionmeasure, vetoed Jan. 30, 1987.   _The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1987, an $88 billion highway andmass transit measure, vetoed March 27, 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
