They say the burning increases the amount of carbon dioxide inthe atmosphere and adds to the greenhouse effect, which causes aglobal warming.   Marcos Pereira, a researcher at the Space Studies Institute, saidexperts in the past two months detected 59,000 fires that devastated12,700 square miles of forest _ an area larger than Maryland.   That represents roughly 1.5 percent of the so-called legalAmazon, a 2 million-square-mile region.   ``We're certainly going to have fewer fires and less destructionin 1989 than in 1988, primarily because we've had unusually heavyrains this year,'' Pereira told The Associated Press by telephonefrom Sao Jose dos Campos, 210 miles southwest of Rio.   In 1988, about 45,600 square miles were destroyed by 205,000fires, Pereira said.   The institute monitors fires in the Amazon by using satellitesthat detect smoke and heat.   Pereira said the government helped reduce the number of fires,mainly by suspending incentives for large-scale agricultural andranching projects.   It also began a plan this month to monitor part of the region byhelicopter and fine those found guilty of clearing the forestillegally.   Officials handed out $9 million in fines in the first 15 days.   ``There's a greater awareness of the problem, on the part of thegovernment and individuals, and that will make it easier to protectthe Amazon,'' Pereira said.   Ranchers and farmers burn off large tracts of the rain forest toclear land for planting and grazing.</TEXT></DOC>
