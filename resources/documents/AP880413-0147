Col. Ron Sconyers, chief public affairs officer for the U.S.Southern Command, told a news conference there were no apparentinjuries on either side in Tuesday night's fighting. It was thesecond reported incident of its kind in two days at the tank farmin Howard Air Force Base, near Panama City.   The firefight took place at the Arriajan Tank Farm, an 800-acredepot where a Marine was shot and killed Monday night whileinvestigating what U.S. officials called a suspected break-in bysix to eight camouflaged men.   A Defense Department spokesman in Washington said the victimappeared to have been shot accidentally by fellow Marine guards,but suggested the incident was sparked by the intrusion ofPanamanian military personnel.   The Panamanian government said the statement was ``totally falseand stupid'' and aimed at justifying ``a military intervention.''   Sconyers said a 12-man Marine patrol reported receiving fire atabout 7:35 p.m. EDT Tuesday from a location where they had observedbetween 40 and 50 ``unauthorized personnel.''   ``The Marines returned the fire. Sporadic firing continued forabout two hours,'' Sconyers said.   Sconyers said the Marine patrol summoned reinforcements, whoengaged the intruders in small arms fire followed by three highexplosive mortar rounds at their suspected positions andilluminated the area with aerial flares.   Sconyers said the intruders were wearing dark uniforms and ``hadsome kind of military hats,'' but declined to identify them asmembers of the Panamanian Defense Forces.   ``I can neither confirm nor deny that they were PDF,'' he said.   On Monday night, a U.S. Marine, Cpl. Ricardo M. Villahermosa,25, was killed while investigating a suspected break-in at thestorage depot.   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said Tuesday that Villahermosaapparently was shot accidentally by fellow Marine guards, but addedthere had been a series of intrusions at the base in recent weeksby ``individuals who were uniformed and camouflaged.''   About two hours after the fighting Tuesday, most of Panama Citywas plunged into darkness by an apparently unrelated power failure.   Earlier, another Southern Command spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. DougSchamp, told reporters there was ``no reason at all at this time''to suspect Panamanian military involvement in Monday's shootingincident.   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the country's de facto leader andhead of its 15,000-strong Defense Forces, has so far successfullydefied U.S. efforts to force him out of office.   The Reagan administration imposed economic sanctions on Panamaafter Noriega was indicted on U.S. drug trafficking charges inFebruary. Panama's banks have been closed for more than a month andthe economy is in a shambles, but Noriega has maintained power.   In a statement Tuesday night, the Defense Forces publicrelations director, Maj. Edgardo Lopez, called Howard's suggestion``totally false and stupid.   Another Panamanian military spokesman, Maj. Daniel DelgadoDiamante, later called Howard's comments ``an act of provocation''aimed at justifying ``an aggression against our territory, ourpeople.''   Schamp said there have been numerous intrusions in the area overthe years, the most recent by a poacher caught with two deadanimals last week.   Villahermosa, of Santurce, Puerto Rico, was one of nearly 2,000Marines and Army personnel sent to Panama in the past few weeks tostep up security for the Panama Canal, other U.S. installations andAmerican citizens.   Officials said he was a member of I Company, 3rd Battalion, 4thMarine Regiment of Camp LeJuene, N.C. and had arrived just a weekago.   Sconyers said Villahermosa was part of a 12-man Marine patrol atthe depot.   The Southern Command and the Pentagon issued identicalstatements saying the shooting Monday ``occurred after an apparentintrusion by six or eight individuals into the tank farm area.''   Sconyers said the Marine had been shot in the stomach and diedfrom massive internal bleeding. The Pentagon said the incident wasunder investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
