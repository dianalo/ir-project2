Aspects of the study included the synthesis of a high-zirconiaglass, a detailed study of the crystallization behavior of the glass,and determination of the mechanical properties of the resultant glassceramics. Transformation toughening was found to be a significant tougheningmechanism in some of the glass ceramics. The particle-size dependenceof the tetragonal-to-monoclinic transformation temperature and the low-temperature(below the bulk equilibrium temperature of tetragonal stability) crystallizationof t-ZrO{sub 2} were both examined. The results are discussed in termsof current theories and explanations. A crystallization treatment wasdesigned to optimize the fracture toughness of the resultant glass ceramic.The material properties (thermal expansion, electrical conductivity,etc.) of this glass ceramic were measured.</TEXT></DOC>
