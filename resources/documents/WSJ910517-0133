The settlement, approved by U.S. District Judge Jack B.Weinstein of Brooklyn, will speed payments by the trust toasbestos victims and provide a badly needed infusion of asmuch as $520 million. The trust, established in 1988 byManville Corp. to enable the former asbestos maker to emergefrom bankruptcy-law proceedings, last year ran out of cash topay new claims.                                                                                                          The settlement could affect as many as 333,000 current andfuture personal-injury claimants.   Judge Weinstein also reaffirmed an injunction barringasbestos victims from suing the company for damages. He saidit was essential to protect Manville from such suits becausethe trust depends on the company for its funding. Asbestos,once widely used in shipbuilding and other industries, causescancers and respiratory illnesses.   Judge Weinstein's decision, which was joined by BankruptcyCourt Judge Burton Lifland of Manhattan, is expected to beappealed by other former asbestos makers, who say thearrangement will force them to pay higher damages in theirown asbestos litigation. Several plaintiffs' attorneys alsoplan to appeal the decision on grounds that it isn't fair toall asbestos victims.   Other plaintiffs' attorneys, however, said they believethe settlement was the best that could be obtained to protectcurrent and future victims.   &quot;Hopefully it will bring about some means to expedite theresolution of claims in the future,&quot; said Robert Hatten, aplaintiffs' attorney in Newport News, Va. &quot;The entire processhas been like Vietnam -- we've been stuck in the mud with noprogress and no end in sight.&quot;   Judge Weinstein, one of the leading judges in the effortto deal with the backlog of asbestos litigation, also usedhis 503-page decision to blast the Manville trust's managersand the plaintiffs' lawyers. He criticized spending by thetrust, including &quot;a rental of a million a year for plushquarters in Washington,&quot; and accused the plaintiffs'attorneys of charging higher fees than they deserved.   As part of the settlement, plaintiffs' attorneys' feeswill be capped at 25% of the claims paid, compared with the33% to 40% they had been receiving.   Judge Weinstein wrote that former asbestos makers faceestimated damages of $26 billion to $51 billion from currentand future personal-injury suits.   The judge urged that efforts be made to come up with asingle system to resolve personal-injury claims against allthe companies who used to make asbestos, because many of theother manufacturers can't afford to continue dealing with theclaims in court.   &quot;Evidence is accumulating that almost all formermanufacturers of asbestos will encounter the same fundamentalfinancial difficulties,&quot; Judge Weinstein wrote.   Calling for Congress and the courts to address theproblem, he added that many former asbestos makers &quot;don'thave, and they probably won't have, assets to pay for theircurrent and contingent asbestos liabilities, given thepresent mode of disposing of asbestos claims.&quot;   ---   BOLAR PHARMACEUTICAL will pay $20 million to settle classaction suit.   The generic drug company, based in Copiague, N.Y., agreedto settle a shareholder class action. The plaintiffs allegedthat six Bolar executives sold shares knowing they had filedfalse documents with the Food and Drug Administration about ageneric drug.   In a statement, the company said it expects to restate itsnet loss for the first quarter to $16.6 million, or 77 centsa share, from $800,916, to reflect a reserve made inanticipation of the settlement.   Under terms of the proposed settlement, which must beapproved by a federal judge, Robert Shulman and Jack Rivers,two officers who resigned last year, have each agreed tocontribute 500,000 shares of Bolar stock to a settlementfund.   The case is a consolidation of 14 suits filed againstBolar between August 1989 and February 1990, said DanielBerger, an attorney for the plaintiffs. The class includesabout 1,000 shareholders who bought stock and options betweenAug. 21, 1987, and Feb. 7, 1990, he said.   The suit accused Bolar of violating federal securitieslaws, breach of fiduciary duties, mismanagement, waste ofcorporate assets, violation of the Racketeer Influenced andCorrupt Organizations Act, fraud and negligentmisrepresentation.   Bolar has been mired in legal problems since 1989, whencongressional investigators said they received informationthat suggested the company had filled capsules with Dyazide,a blood pressure medication made by SmithKline Beecham PLC,to win U.S. approval of its own generic form of version ofthe drug.   In March, Bolar agreed to plead guilty to federal chargesof selling adulterated and mislabeled generic medicine forhigh blood pressure and pay $10 million in fines. The companyalso admitted to obstructing an FDA inquiry and lying toinvestigators. The guilty plea came after a nearly three-yearinvestigation that netted guilty pleas from three formerBolar managers, who are cooperating with the federal inquiry.   In March 1990, Bolar settled a Securities and ExchangeCommission suit without admitting or denying the agency'sallegations that the company had violated securities law.   Irwin Sugarman, Bolar's attorney, said the company has notyet resolved suits filed by SmithKline Beecham and consumers.In addition, Bolar said that Norwich Eaton PharmaceuticalsInc., a unit of Procter andamp; Gamble Co., filed suit in federalcourt in Newark, N.J., alleging that Bolar attemptedfraudulently to obtain FDA approval to market a genericversion of Norwich's Macrodantin, a product used to treaturinary tract infections.   ---   PARENT CAN BE ORDERED not to bad-mouth ex-spouse tochildren.   Florida's highest court ruled that a divorced mother'sFirst Amendment rights were not violated when a lower courtordered her to &quot;instruct the children to love and respecttheir father.&quot;   Laurel and Richard Schutz were divorced in 1978 after sixyears of marriage. In 1981, Mrs. Schutz moved with theirchildren from Miami without notifying the father. By the timeMr. Schutz located his children four years later, thechildren hated him and no longer wanted to see him, theFlorida Supreme Court wrote.   The court ordered Mrs. Schutz to refrain from doing orsaying anything that might interfere with the children'srelationship with their father. It ruled that any burden onher First Amendment rights was &quot;incidental&quot; and necessary toprotect the rights of the children and their father torestore their relationship.   Andrew Leinoff, a Coral Gables lawyer for Mr. Schutz, saidthe ruling is a victory for divorced parents who do not livewith their children. &quot;The court said that a parent must takeaffirmative steps to ensure that the children love anon-custodial parent. The damage has been done in this casebut hopefully the decision will become a bill of rights forother parents,&quot; he said.   Cynthia Greene, a Miami lawyer for Mrs. Schutz, said shewas pleased the decision does not require her client toexpress opinions about her ex-husband she does not believe.   ---   A FORMER OFFICER of First Jersey Securities is indicted.   In a two-count indictment, Jack G. Mondel, the manager ofFirst Jersey's Cherry Hills branch, was charged by the U.S.attorney in Newark with conspiring to launder nearly $600,000and defraud the IRS by helping brokerage customers hide cash.Between February 1984 and August 1986, Mr. Mondel allegedlyprevented First Jersey and various banks from reporting largecash payments to the IRS. He also allegedly tried to arrangegold transactions to conceal cash income.   Under IRS regulations, cash transactions over a $10,000threshold must be reported to the IRS on a form thatidentifies the person making the cash payment.   The indictment does not allege that any of the banksinvolved were aware that money was being laundered.   Mr. Mondel, of Cherry Hills, N.J., could not be reached.   ---   NOTED: Robert P. Davis, the Solicitor of the U.S.Department of Labor, will join the Washington office ofMayer, Brown andamp; Platt later this month. Mr. Davis, who servedas chief of staff to former U.S. Transportation SecretaryElizabeth Dole from 1983 to 1985, will concentrate on labor,employee benefits and regulatory work at the Chicago-basedlaw firm.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
