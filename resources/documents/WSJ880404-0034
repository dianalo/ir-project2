These investors rely on &quot;asset allocation&quot; models to bring cold mathematical reason to the tough call of whether to be in or out of stocks. Their approach sparkled in 1987, as most asset allocators backed away from equities before the market crash. Their average returns for the year: 12% to 15%, well ahead of the 5% gain in the overall stock market.    At least $20 billion is currently under direct management of asset allocators. Another $100 billion may indirectly use some of their techniques. Leading asset allocators include the investment units of Wells Fargo andamp; Co., Citicorp, First Chicago Corp. and Mellon Bank Corp., as well as TSA Capital Management Inc., Los Angeles.    &quot;In the last week, stocks have seemed much less attractive than bonds,&quot; says Richard Boling, managing director of TSA. His firm manages $2.5 billion, and it has put as much as 89% of assets into bonds, with most of the rest in cash reserves. That's a switch from mid-March, when bonds were just 65% of assets and stocks accounted for about 25%.    Mr. Boling says the recent rise in bond yields is a major factor in TSA's bearishness on equities. Higher bond yields make stocks' dividend yields seem punier in comparison. As investors move to bonds from stocks, equities' price-earnings ratios can be driven lower. Furthermore, Mr. Boling says that as stock market volatility calms down, the potential for bigger investment gains from equities may be diminishing.    Edward Kirschner, who runs an asset allocation model for PaineWebber Inc., also admits to &quot;a modest preference for bonds.&quot; Mr. Kirschner currently advises clients to have 31% of assets in stocks, 58% in bonds and 11% in cash. By comparison, he was advocating 60% in stocks at the beginning of 1987.    The largest asset allocator, Wells Fargo Investment Advisors, won't say exactly what its model currently advises. But &quot;it's pretty close to Ed Kirschner's,&quot; says Jeffrey Skelton, a senior Wells executive.    Also tilted toward bonds is First Chicago Investment Advisors. It averages 65% exposure to stocks on its asset allocation accounts, but it currently is at just 49%. Within the stock market, First Chicago is concentrating on small-capitalization issues, money center banks and the capital goods area.    Asset allocators generally take a &quot;buy low, sell high&quot; approach to financial markets. Thus, the stock market's relatively good showing the past few months may be spurring them to do a little profit-taking. The Dow Jones Industrials have risen about 250 points from their Oct. 19 lows, closing at 1988.06 last Thursday.    One of the few asset allocators who's bullish about equities is Charles DuBois of Citicorp Investment Management. Most of his accounts just choose between stocks and cash, and he has them set at 100% stocks. In fact, Mr. DuBois has used leverage to boost some accounts to the equivalent of 180% in stocks.    Mr. DuBois takes cheer from &quot;sentiment indicators,&quot; such as the high cash reserves of equity mutual funds -- which eventually are likely to be put back into the stock market. He also figures the merger boom is shrinking the supply of stocks, making those that remain more valuable.    Most other asset allocators don't look at such variables, figuring that they can be swayed too much by irrational factors. Another difference: Mr. DuBois's model takes a more favorable view of interest rates by focusing on short-term rates, which haven't moved much, rather than longer-term bond yields, which have risen.    With asset allocators having done well last year, new clients are signing on, and some think total funds under management could double in the next year or two, to $40 billion. That begs the question: Could asset allocators ever grow so big that their trading might jolt the rest of the market, the way users of &quot;portfolio insurance&quot; did last October?    Asset allocators insist that isn't a danger. The strategies involved in portfolio insurance &quot;reinforced the market's trend,&quot; says PaineWebber's Mr. Kirschner. &quot;Asset allocation tends to involve investing against the trend. If anything, it should be a force for stability.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
