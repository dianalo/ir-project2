In a decision overturning a Worcester County judge, the highcourt said it could find nothing in the federal or stateconstitutions compelling ``the conclusion that a defendant has theright to counsel before deciding whether to submit to aBreathalyzer test.''   In a unanimous opinion, the high court said ``the moment atwhich a person must decide to take or to refuse to take aBreathalyzer test is not a critical stage in the criminal process.''   Refusal to take the test results in suspension of a driver'slicense for 120 days.   The decision stemmed from an appeal by the Worcester Countydistrict attorney's office in central Massachusetts in a caseinvolving Roy D. Brazelton, a Worcester-area resident arrested in1987 for operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol.   Brazelton was taken to the Worcester police station and booked,and was advised of his Miranda rights and his right to take abreath test or blood alcohol test.   When an officer told Brazelton he couldn't call his attorneyuntil after he had decided whether to take the breath test,Brazelton refused the examination.   District Judge Thomas F. Sullivan Jr. dismissed the chargesagainst Brazelton on grounds that he should have been allowed tocall his attorney first, saying ``it would not have caused anunreasonable delay in the administration'' of the test.   But the high court, in voiding Sullivan's order and remandingBrazelton's case to trial, said ``formidable practical problems''could arise if the lower court's ruling stood. For instance, thejustices said, ``If an attorney is not available, a delay may ensueand the test results may then be stale and inaccurate.''   Brazelton's attorney, Herbert F. Travers III, said that becausecourts in other states have been divided on the question, ``atleast on 14th Amendment (due process) grounds, it may be a properissue for determination by the (U.S.) Supreme Court.''   It was the first time the high court had been asked to decide onthe right to counsel before a breath test.   Some courts in other states, such as Alaska, have found theright to counsel on breath tests in their state laws, stateconstitutions or the U.S. Constitution.</TEXT></DOC>
