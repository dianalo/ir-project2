Gen.Thomas W. Kelly, the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.;   Still, some in the intelligence community were aghast that Pentagon officialswent even as far as they did.;    Even Kelly's acknowledgment of acommunications intercept -- or &quot;sigint,&quot; for signals intelligence, as it isknown in the intelligence community -- was considered highly unusual.;    Inaddition, experts fear that the administration has risked drying up whateverintelligence sources the U.S. has in Iraq, and also has given Saddam Husseincritical information that indicates its successes in monitoring hiscommunications.;    Seeking to close the door on debate over the bombing,White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: &quot;The military has lookedinto this. They have considered it. They discussed it publicly; announcedtheir conclusion. We are satisfied that we've looked into it and did the rightthing for the right reasons and we will continue to attack command and controlcenters.&quot;;    Asked why the coalition felt it needed to continue bombingBaghdad, rather than restricting its targets to the troops and supply linescloser to the Kuwaiti battlefield, Fitzwater said, &quot;their command and controlcenter is there. Their military is there, just like our military is inWashington. It's as simple as that.&quot;;    To the suggestion that theadministration had offered no proof that the bombed facility was a command andcontrol center, Fitzwater said: &quot;We think that it is, without question in ourmind, through various intelligence sources, and not a matter that we have toaddress again. . . .&quot;;    Consequently, the question of the facility's purposeremains unanswered and open to conjecture.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DOYLE MCMANUS AND JAMES GERSTENZANG, Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910215  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  18A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  556  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday February 15, 199100046152,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
