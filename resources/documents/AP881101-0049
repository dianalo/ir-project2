The 14 public utilities from around the state voted Monday toapprove the settlement that would let them out of the trial, whichstems from WPPSS' record default on $2.25 billion in bonds used tofinance construction of two nuclear power plants that never werecompleted.   The agreement, which also involves the state of Washington andthe federal Bonneville Power Administration, leaves SnohomishCounty Public Utility District the only remaining utility defendant.   ``It's an opportunity to get it behind us,'' Gov. Booth Gardnersaid of the settlement. It removes a ``burr in the saddle.''   Snohomish contracted for the biggest single share, 13 percent,on the two partially built WPPSS plants that were abandoned in1982. Under the settlement memorandum, Snohomish would be allowedto settle until Nov. 10.   Snohomish officials said they welcomed the settlement proposal,even though they were not included.   Attorney Don Hale said there was a risk remaining in trial, butit appeared settlement figures were coming down as the trialprogressed and that could work to his utility district's benefit.   But Hale and other Snohomish officials would not comment on thepossibility of settlement, which would call for it to pay $48.7million, based on the size of its interest in the abandoned plants.   Other defendants remaining include two engineering firms and afinancial advisor firm, out of nearly 100 entities originally sued.   The trial, which was moved to Tucson, Ariz., was recessed lastweek when attorneys reported a settlement was possible. It wasscheduled to resume Wednesday.   ``It's a (settlement) we can certainly live with and handle, andit won't have great diverse ... impact on our state,'' said Tacomaattorney Albert Malanca, who engineered the agreement.   Under the agreement, the 14 utilities would pay $181 million,BPA and the federal government would pay $35 million and the statewould pay $10 million to plaintiffs who sued after WPPSS defaultedin 1983.   The plants were begun but never finished after regional energyplanners determined power from the plants wouldn't be needed. Theregion's economy suffered when WPPSS attempted to build fivemulti-billion dollar nuclear power plants and finished only one.   Several utilities that agreed to the settlement said rateincreases may be necessary but would be small.   The governor said the state would pay $10 million toward thesettlement, if the Legislature concurs.   Washington state is not a defendant in the case, but asettlement should end a separate lawsuit against it involving thesame plaintiffs, who are suing to recover $7.5 billion _ the $2.3billion default plus interest.   BPA participation still requires the approval of the U.S.Department of Justice, which was expected this week, and finalapproval will have to come from U.S. District Judge WilliamBrowning, who is overseeing the case.   ``A settlement now will put one of the region's major problemsbehind us,'' said Jim Jura, head of the BPA. ``It would enable usto devote more of our time, attention and legal talent toproductive work.''   Besides Tacoma City Light, utilities agreeing to the settlementare the city of Ellensburg and Cowlitz, Mason No. 3, Clark, GraysHarbor, Lewis, Okanogan, Pacific, Skamania, Wahkiakum, Benton,Franklin and Klickitat county Public Utility Districts.   Tacoma director of utilities Ted Coates said the settlementwould bring to $591 million the amount paid to plaintiffs.   A class of more than 24,000 past and present bondholders andChemical Bank of New York, a trustee for bondholders, areplaintiffs in the trial that began Sept. 7 and was expected to lasta year. They alleged the defendants conspired to lie and hideinformation that might have discouraged potential investors.</TEXT></DOC>
