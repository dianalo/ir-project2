Playboy Enterprises is the latest company to find its wayaround the corporate tradition of one share, one vote. TheChicago publisher plans to issue three shares of nonvoting,or B stock, for each voting A share.</LP><TEXT>   With a supportive nod from Shearson Lehman Hutton, Playboyhas touted its plan as a benign recapitalization that willenable it to issue nonvoting shares without diluting HughHefner's 71% control.   Securities analysts accept the company line. &quot;As abusiness tool it makes sense. It doesn't matter whether theshares vote or not,&quot; says PaineWebber's J. Kendrick Noble.   Others aren't so sure. Rex Sinquefield, chief investmentofficer for Dimensional Fund Advisers, a big Playboystockholder, is rankled that Playboy's plan will be imposedJune 7 in a majority vote of all shares, including Mr.Hefner's. &quot;The most honorable thing to do would have been tolet the public holders decide&quot; in a separate vote, he says.   As of now, the 64-year-old founder has to hang on to amajority of the stock to keep control. But with two classesoutstanding, he or his estate could sell the nonvoting stock-- cashing out 75% of his investment -- without changing his71% voting control of the company. If Playboy stumbled later,shareholders with the biggest economic stake in the companywouldn't have the means to affect its future.   Some investors oppose all nonvoting stock. &quot;You end upwith nonresponsive management,&quot; says Richard Koppes, generalcounsel of the California Public Employees Retirement System.   In 1988, the Securities and Exchange Commission created abarrier to issuing dual classes of stock; it prohibited stockexchanges from listing shares of companies that &quot;restrict orreduce the per-share voting rights of {current} holders.&quot;(Previously existing dual stock classes, including those ofDow Jones, publisher of this newspaper, were allowed toremain listed.)   Until recently, the 1988 rule seemed to protect theone-share, one-vote principle. But nonvoting shares now areon the rise.   Reader's Digest Association sold nonvoting shares in arecent initial public offering and Viacom International hasan issue in the works.   Holders of voting stock at times have been offeredtakeover premiums that weren't offered to nonvoting holders-- as happened when Donald Trump went after ResortsInternational. Playboy's plan has a feature to prevent suchtactics. Anyone buying 10% or more of its A stock would berequired to offer to buy an equal stake in the B stock, andto pay at least as much per share.   Because of this clause, Shearson says, Playboy's A and Bshares should trade at about equal prices. However, theclause isn't bullet-proof. If a raider first bought nonvotingstock at the market price, he then could pay a premium for anequal stake in the voting stock. Result: Holders of Playboy Astock might receive a higher price.   Christie Hefner, the 37-year-old chairman and daughter ofthe founder, says that, while creating dual stock &quot;gives theestate a vehicle for dealing with estate taxes,&quot; that wasn'tthe purpose of the plan and she doesn't think her father islikely to sell. &quot;The notion that he would cash out and thenallow the value of the asset to decline isn't a real issue.Hefner &quot;doesn't have those intentions.&quot;   Creating nonvoting shares, she notes, won't increase herfather's control or give him additional rights. Playboy'sintent, she adds, was to give management &quot;the mostflexibility.&quot;   Playboy hasn't issued stock in the past because Mr. Hefnerhas been unwilling to dilute his control. Ms. Hefner wantsthe freedom to do so -- first, for use in management options,and later, perhaps, for use in acquisitions. As it standsnow, Ms. Hefner says she has the burden of managing a publiccompany without having its chief benefit -- access to publicmarkets to sell additional shares.   Few doubt that Ms. Hefner's intentions are honorable.Since taking the helm in 1988, she has refocused PlayboyEnterprises on publishing, licensing and video; profit thisyear is up.   &quot;Reading between the lines, there is a tension&quot; betweenMs. Hefner's needs as a manager and her father's desire toretain control, Mr. Sinquefield says.   Ms. Hefner says that she doesn't expect the issue to becontroversial. Then why not let minority holders vote on it-- separately? The founder's vote should count, too, shesays. &quot;I'm sort of a believer in one share, one vote.&quot;   ---   Playboy   (NYSE; Symbol: PLA)                                                                                                          Business: Magazines, cable television                                                                                                          Year ended June 30, 1989:   Revenue: $166.2 million   Net loss: $3.8 million                                                                                                          Third quarter, March 31, 1990:   Per-share earnings: 5 cents vs. 2 cents                                                                                                          Average daily trading volume:   1,448 shares                                                                                                          Common shares outstanding: 9.4 million</TEXT></DOC>
