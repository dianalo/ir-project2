The bulk of the Contra forces havespent most of the last two years at camps in Honduras.   Ms. Tutwiler said the admnistration has dispatched veteran envoyHarry Shlaudeman to Honduras to confer with the Contras about theirconcerns. Shlaudeman served as ambassador to four South Americancountries and was called out of retirement last year to deal withthe Nicaraguan issue.   Ms. Tutwiler said that equally important to the Contrademobilization is the ``full and unequivocal transfer'' of civiland military power to the new Nicaraguan government.   Both President Daniel Ortega and the victorious oppositioncandidate in Sunday's election, Violeta Chamorro, have said theContras should be disbanded. Ortega has indicated thatdemobilization is necessary if a peaceful transition is to becarried out on April 25, inauguration day.   But State Department officials said that a former Contraregional commander who went back to Nicaragua to join the electionprocess several weeks ago accused the Sandinistas of mistreatingreturning Contras.   The Contra officer, known as Comandante Johnson, said that of 41rebels who had returned in peace, 27 were in prison, 12 were deadand only two were free. State Department officials, insisting onanonymity, said they believe Johnson's figures are essentiallycorrect.   About 10,000 rebels are at camps in southern Honduras, survivingon food and other necessities provided by the United States. Thetotal number being cared for in the camps, including familymembers, is 60,000.   The demobilization of the Contras and civilian control over themilitary, now under Sandinista party control, have dominated thepolitical debate in Nicaragua since Mrs. Chamorro's electionvictory.</TEXT></DOC>
