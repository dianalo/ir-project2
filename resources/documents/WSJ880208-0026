The agency attributed the decline to a drop-off in buyer interest in OPEC oil, reflecting what analysts have called a growing unwillingness among oil companies to pay OPEC prices that are well above free-market levels.    OPEC's official average price is $18 a barrel, whereas crude of comparable quality is selling in the open market for about $1.50 a barrel less.    OPEC production in January was 17 million barrels a day, down from 18.3 million a day in December, according to the energy agency's monthly report. The Paris-based agency monitors world oil market developments on behalf of 21 Western governments.    As previously reported, industry analysts estimated that oil output for the month would be 16.5 million barrels to 17.5 million barrels a day. </TEXT></DOC>
