Barbour, Esq., Office of ChiefCounsel for Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room H-3837,14th andamp; Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230.Preliminary StatementThe Office of Export Enforcement (``the Agency''), Bureau of Export Administration,U.S. Department of Commerce issued a December 22, 1988 charging letteragainst Respondent Klaus Westphal. The letter was issued under the authorityof the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C.A. app. 2401-2420),as amended (``the Act''), and under the authority of the Export AdministrationRegulations (``the Regulations''), promulgated pursuant to the Act.\1\<NOTE/> The letter alleged that Respondent had violated andSection;787.6 of the Regulations in 1983-84 by making four reexports of U.S.-originequipment from the Federal Republic of Germany without the required U.S.authorization.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Act was reauthorized and amended by the Export AdministrationAmendments Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-64, 99 Stat. 120 (July 12, 1985), andamended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-418,102 Stat. 1107 (August 23, 1988). <ITAG tagnum="28">The Regulations, formerly codified at 15 CFR Parts 368-399, were redesignatedas 15 CFR Parts 768-799, effective October 1, 1988 (53 FR 37751, September28, 1988).</ITAG>When three months passed after the issuance of the December 22, 1988 chargingletter without Respondent's having filed an answer or any submission, anOrder of March 22, 1989 declared Respondent in default and directed theAgency to make the default submission prescribed by andSection; 788.8 ofthe Regulations. The Agency made that submission on April 21, 1989. OnApril 24, 1989 the Agency filed a copy of a letter, dated April 15, 1989,that it had received from Respondent on April 21, 1989 in which Respondentprovided a new address for himself and stated generally that he was seekingcounsel from officials and a lawyer in the FRG and from a lawyer in theUnited States.DiscussionProcedurally, Respondent is in default under andSection; 788.8 of the Regulations,as declared by the Order of March 22, 1989. Section 788.7 provides thatthe charging letter must be answered within 30 days of service, and Respondentwas advised by the charging letter that failure to file timely would bea default under andSection; 388.8. Respondent has never answered the chargingletter.Evidence that the charging letter was served on Respondent on or aboutJanuary 4, 1989 was included in the Agency's April 21, 1989 default submission(Exh. 1). Such service is further evidenced by Respondent's April 15, 1989letter in which he apparently acknowledged this proceeding.Respondent's letter does not cure his default that was declared by theOrder of March 22, 1989. The 30-day period for Respondent's answer followingservice of the charging letter expired long before Respondent's letter,which was dated April 15, 1989 and received by the Agency April 21, 1989.Further, Respondent addressed that letter to the Agency and never filedit with this Tribunal, whereas an answer, as Respondent was advised bythe charging letter, is to be filed with this Tribunal; a copy of Respondent'sletter, as noted, was filed with this Tribunal by the Agency April 24,1989. Finally, the content of Respondent's letter_that he was seeking counselfrom officials and lawyers_does not excuse his default in answering thecharging letter.As for the Agency's evidence to support the allegations of its chargingletter, in its April 21, 1989 submission it withdrew its allegations concerningthree of the four reexports cited in the charging letter and supplied evidenceto support its allegations concerning the remaining reexport. That reexportoccurred December 23, 1983, and it involved the shipment by an FRG companyfrom the FRG to Czechoslovakia of a U.S.-origin machine for the manufactureof semiconductor and other devices. According to the Agency's evidence,Respondent was in 1983 the managing director of that FRG company, whichwas a subsidiary of an American company. The Agency presented copies ofdocuments in which Respondent during March-August 1983 had sent price quotationsfor this machine to the Czechoslovak buyer.The Agency's evidence showed that in September 1983 the FRG company orderedthe machine from its American parent in the United States, and in October1983 the American parent sent the company an invoice for it. This evidenceshowed further that also in October 1983 the Czechoslovak buyer sent theFRG company a purchase order for the machine, and in December 1983 theFRG company sent invoices to the buyer for the purchase. According to additionalAgency documents, the FRG company shipped the machine by truck from theFRG to Czechoslovakia and the Czechoslovak buyer on December 23, 1983.The Agency's evidence showed also that Respondent concealed from the U.S.parent company both the order from and the sale to the Czechoslovak buyer.The Agency's presentation showed that a U.S. authorization, for nationalsecurity reasons, was required for the reexport of this U.S.-origin machinefrom the FRG to Czechoslovakia, and also showed no issuance of such authorization.In addition, the Agency's evidence indicated that, had proper applicationbeen made for such an authorization, a presumption of denial would haveexisted in the processing of it. In light of all these factors, the Agencyproposed a ten-year denial of Respondent's export U.S. privileges.ConclusionRespondent is in default in this proceeding, and the Agency has sufficientlydocumented the one allegation against Respondent that it has pursued. Thusthe conclusion follows that, as alleged in the charging letter and elaboratedin more detail in the Agency's April 21, 1989 submission, on December 23,1983 Respondent, in his capacity as managing director of an FRG subsidiaryof an American company, violated andSection; 787.6 of the Regulations bymaking a particular reexport. That reexport, from the FRG to Czechoslovakia,was of a U.S.-origin machine for the manufacture of semiconductor and otherdevices; and the reexport was made without the U.S. authorization thatwas required for national security reasons. The Agency's proposed sanctionof a ten-year denial of U.S. export privileges is severe; but in view ofthe seriousness of the offense, it is reasonable. Accordingly, it shallbe so ordered.OrderI.
