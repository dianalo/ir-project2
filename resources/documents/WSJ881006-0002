Augusto Pinochet, and sharply conflicting first results suggested that they rejected his proposal to rule for nine more years.    But widespread confusion over the vote-counting persisted last night, with neither side declaring outright victory.    Results tallied by the opposition, or 'no' campaign, based on 44% of the vote, gave the opposition 57.1% against 40.8% for the regime. The figures were taken from throughout the country, said Genaro Arriagada, secretary general of the &quot;no&quot; movement. Early results from the centrist Radio Mineria and the left-leaning Radio Cooperativa also suggested that the 'no' vote had a clear advantage.    In the first admission by a supporter of the regime that Gen. Pinochet may have lost, Sergio Onofre Jarpa, a former interior minister in the military government, said: &quot;It seems the 'no' vote is winning.&quot; This trend, he added, was not conclusive and was based on close to one-third of the returns.    Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry repeatedly delayed promised partial results, limiting itself to a declaration based on 3.04% of the vote. This showed the regime winning by a margin of 51.3% to 46.5%, with the remainder either absentions or spoiled ballots.    Opposition leaders dismissed these figures as so fragmentary as to constitute &quot;disinformation.&quot;    It appeared increasingly possible that the two camps would give differing accounts of the final results, expected during the night. A respected French opinion-poll organization gave the opposition 60% and the regime 40%, based on interviews with people after they had voted.    The country was calm as 7.4 million Chileans went to the polls to say 'yes' or 'no' to the 72-year-old Gen. Pinochet ruling until 1997. He seized power in a 1973 military coup in which democratically elected Marxist President Salvador Allende died.    If the 'no' vote wins, the general is obliged by the 1980 constitution he drafted to call open presidential elections by the end of next year.    Military patrols combed the streets of the capital, but there was no sign of disorder after a night of uncertainty Tuesday that was punctuated by power cuts and occasional explosions. People waited patiently in long lines to cast their ballots. Many of them were voting for the first time in this country, which had known a long democratic tradition before Gen. Pinochet seized power.    In the voting, widespread disapproval of military rule, of the regime's human-rights abuses and of Gen. Pinochet's wish to extend his presidency to 24 years were offset, but apparently only partially, by fears of communism and of the unknown and by worries that Chile's strong recent economic growth might be disrupted.    The young and inhabitants of big cities tended to favor overwhelmingly the 'no.' Support of Gen. Pinochet is concentrated in the countryside, small towns and among those still traumatized by the economic hardships endured under Allende's Marxist government.    With the secret ballot tightly controlled by officials of both camps, there appeared to be little chance of significant fraud. There was, however, widespread concern at possible maneuvers by the junta during the night if the vote were seen to be going the opposition's way. There have been power cuts on two of the past three nights, attributed by the regime to terrorist attacks but dismissed as self-serving by many observers. Another such blackout during the vote-counting could create a chaotic situation.    But the atmosphere at voting booths was one of civility. There were only occasional complaints over the long waits.    At the national stadium, transformed by the military into a concentration camp in 1973, more than 40,000 people waited in the sun to vote. One, Angel Rojas, the 33-year-old owner of an auto-parts business, said he and 30 of his 32 employees intended to vote 'no.' He said, &quot;Chile has the maturity for democracy.&quot;    Behind him, Alfonso Roman, 82, countered that he intended to vote 'yes' because this was more secure. &quot;The young don't remember what this country was like under Marxism,&quot; he said. He noted, however, that his two daughters planned to vote against the regime.    Standing behind Mr. Roman, law student Raul Ferrara, 22, said he would vote 'no' and that 60% of his faculty also favored the opposition. But he added that his family was divided, with his mother favoring the regime and his father opposed. Gen. Pinochet has expressed &quot;particular faith in the women of Chile.&quot;    Final results had been expected around midnight, but the long lines delayed the vote count. A period of great tension is expected in the immediate aftermath of the poll, whatever the result. The armed forces are fervently committed to remaining in power until the end of the century, while the opposition is convinced that its time has come. </TEXT></DOC>
