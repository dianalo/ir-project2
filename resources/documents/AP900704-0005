(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   America has gone Goofy this summer. AndMickey. And King Kong. And Shamu.   The tourist behemoth that includes Orlando and its environsdraws 13 million visitors a year. And this summer should cementCentral Florida's reputation as the nation's favorite vacationdestination.   Universal Studios Florida, a glitzy, high-tech version of theCalifornia attraction, opened officially June 7, and is expected tobe a strong competitor to the year-old Disney-MGM studios.   Either of the two movie parks would be the largest attractionalmost anywhere else. But here they stand in the shadow of DisneyWorld, with its EPCOT Center, and stand shoulder to shoulder withSea World, Cypress Gardens and other older tourist attractions.   Of course, not everyone can go to Disney World _ if they did,the lines would rival the queues that form for just about anystaple in Moscow.   So come vacation time this summer, some will go to their nearestbeaches, some will flee to the mountains, some will stay at homeand avoid doing the home projects they had planned.   But some will join the crowds who flock to the popular vacationspots.   What follows is a tour of a few of those spots, as selected byVoit Gilmore, president of the American Society of Travel Agents.</TEXT><HEAD>CENTRAL FLORIDA:</HEAD><TEXT>   Too many Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles? An over-abundance ofDick Tracyana? Too much Shamu? Impossible.   To meet the Universal challenge, Disney-MGM has introduced alive-character Muppet show, outdoor audience-participationperformances of those aggressive Turtles and a rousing musical showbased on the Dick Tracy characters.   And Sea World is offering an all-new Shamu extravaganza, withtwo _ count 'em, two _ underwater cameras to capture the whale atwork.   Meanwhile, the $630 million Universal park, built on 444 acres,has had its problems. Audience-involvement shows featuring Jaws,King Kong and a San Francisco earthquake failed to operate onopening day.   Technicians fixed up Jaws in a day or two. They are reworkingthe earthquake to make it more dramatic; it is not expected to openuntil mid-July.   ``Kongfrontation,'' the massive-scale Kong attack on New YorkCity, has overcome its computer problems. ``It will be the finestride in the business, period,'' says the park's general manager,Tom Williams.   Both parks have full movie and TV production facilities, withUniversal boasting the largest sound stage complex outsideHollywood.   ``I can't see anything in the near future that will hold downthe crowds,'' said Charley Ridgway, Disney's publicity director.</TEXT><HEAD>HAWAII:</HEAD><TEXT>   June, July and August traditionally are the heavy months forHawaiian tourism, and this year officials expect an increase of 3to 5 percent in the number of visitors, says Gene Cotter of theHawaii Visitors Bureau.   This is not ascribed to any new attractions _ no one has built aKilauea adventure ride, with mock lava spewing on appreciativemainlanders.   First-time visitors _ about 47 percent of the traffic _ usuallyzero in on Oahu, the main island, and possibly one other island,Cotter said. Their agenda is sightseeing _ luaus are still big _and some beach time.   The outer islands are prized by repeat visitors. There are fewtourist attractions; instead, vacationers must be satisfied withthe lush beauty of tropical islands.   ``They really are beautiful places,'' says Mike Foley of thePolynesian Cultural Center.</TEXT><HEAD>GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK:</HEAD><TEXT>   Forget Yosemite. Forget Yellowstone. Great Smoky MountainsNational Park is the most popular national park in the country,drawing 8.5 million visitors last year.   This partly due to an accident of geography _ the park is withina two-day drive of half the nation's population.   But it also is testament to the park's 520,000 acres straddlingthe Tennessee-North Carolina border, its 16 6,000-foot mountains,its 975 miles of hiking trails (including 70 miles of theAppalachian Trail) and 700 miles of fishable streams.   It is hard to believe that a park of this size could be crowded,but spokeswoman Nancy Gray said popular campsites are fully bookedon weekends a month in advance, and traffic on the two main roadsis growing.   ``A high percentage of our visitors are the kind who stay in thecar and do a windshield experience,'' she said.</TEXT><HEAD>NEW YORK CITY:</HEAD><TEXT>   People still want to see the Statue of Liberty, RockefellerCenter and Times Square, but that's not all. They have a hankeringto visit the New York Stock Exchange.   ``Everyone wants to see that,'' said Jack MacBean, a spokesmanfor the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``I guess becauseit's been in the news so much lately. All I know is that they hadto reorganize their whole tour schedule to handle the crowds.''   Dave Hetland of Merced, Calif., and his daughters Christy, 19,and Heather, 16, were among those eager to see the bastion ofcapitalism.   ``We've seen it in the movies,'' said Christy, who was posingfor pictures with her sister outside the Rockefeller Center skatingrink. ``It'll be neat to see what it's really like,'' her sisteradded.   They also wanted to view the United Nations, take a walking tourof Greenwich Village and see ``Les Miserables'' on Broadway.   Myron and Holly Civils of Miami added one more stop: Trump Tower.   Were they going to see the place or the man?   ``The place, but if I get to see the man I'll be just ashappy,'' Mrs. Civils said.</TEXT><HEAD>ALASKA:</HEAD><TEXT>   In New York, they're flocking to see the market that crashed in1987. In Alaska, vacationers are boarding sightseeing boats thatwill take them to the site of another disaster _ Bligh Reef, wherethe tanker Exxon Valdez went aground last year.   The resulting spill frightened the Alaskan tourist industry;visitors had declined by 40,000 a year in 1987 and 1988, and therewas reason to believe tourism would join wildlife and the shorelineas victims of the black goop.   It didn't happen. Exxon poured thousands of dollars into tourismadvertising to counteract the pictures of polluted Alaska, and thestate launched a successful campaign to explain the size of Alaskaand point out the many uncontaminated places.   Tourism rebounded to the level of 1986, when more than threequarters of a million visitors came to Alaska.   More than half of the Alaska visitors arrive with a package orcharter tour.   Typically, these include lodging at Anchorage; a train ridenorth to Denali National Park to see North America's highest peak,Mount McKinley; a Prince William Sound boat tour to see glaciers;``flightseeing,'' seeing Alaska by air from small planes; andfishing excursions to the Kenai River or south central bays.</TEXT></DOC>
