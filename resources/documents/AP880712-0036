He has expressed his complete satisfaction with the policyand reiterated his belief that the actions of the USS Vincennes onJuly 3 in the case of the Iranian airliner were justifiabledefensive actions.   At the same time, he remains personally saddened at the tragicdeath of the innocent victims of this accident and has alreadyexpressed his deep regret to their families.   Prompted by the humanitarian traditions of our nation, thepresident has decided that the United States will offercompensation, on an ex gratia basis, to the families of the victimswho died in the Iranian airliner incident. Details concerningamounts, timing and other matters remain to be worked out.   It should be clearly understood that payment will go to thefamilies, not governments, and will be subject to the normal U.S.legal requirements, including, if necessary, appropriate action byCongress.   In the case of Iran, arrangements will be made throughappropriate third parties. This offer of ex gratia compensation isconsistent with international practice and is a humanitarian effortto ease the hardship of the families. It is offered on a voluntarybasis, not on the basis of any legal liability or obligation.   The responsibility for this tragic incident, and for the deathsof hundreds of thousands of other innocent victims as a result ofthe Iran-Iraq war, lies with those who refuse to end the conflict.   A particularly heavy burden of responsibility rests with thegovernment of Iran which has refused for almost a year to acceptand implement Security Council Resolution 598, while it continuesunprovoked attacks on innocent neutral shipping and crews in theinternational waters of the gulf.   In fact, at the time of the Iran Air incident, U.S. forces weremilitarily engaged with Iranian forces as a result of the latter'sunprovoked attacks upon neutral ships and a U.S. Navy helicopter.The urgent necessity to end this conflict is reinforced by thedangers it poses to neighboring countries and the deplorableprecedent of the increasingly frequent use of chemical weapons byboth sides, causing still more casualties.   Only an end to the war, an objective we desire, can halt theimmense suffering in the region and put an end to innocent loss oflife. Our goal is peace in the gulf and on land. We urge Iran andIraq to work with the Security Council for an urgent comprehensivesettlement of the war pursuant to Resolution 598. Meanwhile, UnitedStates forces will continue their mission in the area, keenly awareof the risks involved and ready to face them.</TEXT></DOC>
