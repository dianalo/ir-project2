But this summer, CIP Inc., one of Canada's leading newsprint producers, replaced wood-based pulp with a hemp-like crop called kenaf to produce 20 metric tons of newsprint at its Trois-Rivieres mill.    The test run, backed by the U.S. Agriculture Department and a California newspaper, was considered a success and may lead to construction of a $300 million newsprint mill along the Rio Grande that would be the first in North America to use kenaf as a raw material.    Promoters of the project say kenaf could provide a low-cost replacement for wood in the manufacture of paper and a badly needed alternative crop for farmers in the southern U.S.    &quot;I feel very strongly that there's a high probability of this materializing,&quot; says Charles Thompson, vice president of product development at CIP, a unit of Montreal-based Canadian Pacific Ltd. &quot;There will be a mill producing kenaf pulp or newsprint by the early 1990s.&quot;    Some paper-industry officials aren't impressed, contending that the project can't work because of uncertainties with growing, harvesting and storing the crop.    &quot;I would be shocked&quot; if the project goes ahead, says William Price, president of Newsprint South Sales Inc., the sales arm of Newsprint South Inc., which is building a conventional newsprint mill in Mississippi.    Making paper from non-wood fibers is nothing new. &quot;You can make paper out of anything, from rags on,&quot; says Nicholas Keane, vice president of marketing at Reed Inc., the Canadian newsprint arm of Reed International PLC of Britain. &quot;But is it commercially feasible? That's the question.&quot;    Critics say the problem with non-wood fibers is that supplies are uncertain and the quality isn't up to North American standards for paper. But that isn't the case with kenaf, its backers say.    &quot;Kenaf newsprint is equally as good as west coast, southern or northern newsprint&quot; made with wood fiber, says CIP's Mr. Thompson.    &quot;We were extremely pleased with the strength, the whiteness and the quality of the paper,&quot; says Gene Patterson, chairman and chief executive of the St. Petersburg Times, a Florida daily and one of several newspapers that tested CIP's kenaf newsprint in a regular press run this summer. Mr. Patterson says a new source of newsprint could be a big boon to publishers. &quot;Common sense tells me that this could create cheaper newsprint. Since one-third of our bucks go into newsprint, we're very interested in it.&quot;    Kenaf is a hemp-like crop that grows as high as 12 to 15 feet in five months in semi-tropical climates. The U.S. Agriculture Department began studying the plant 40 years ago, originally as a substitute for jute in the making of rope. It later turned back to kenaf when it was studying nonwood fiber to make pulp.    The American Newspaper Publishers Association became involved in the late 1970s in an effort to diversify publishers' newsprint sources. Kenaf was grown in Arizona and made into newsprint in a trial that involved several newspapers and International Paper Co., then CIP's parent.    That test was less than a complete success. Dirt that accumulated in the kenaf during harvesting wasn't all removed and ended up in the paper. The kenaf also jammed in some equipment because it had been cut in lengths that were several feet long.    The thrust behind the current test comes from Kenaf International Inc., formed in 1981. Its major shareholders are the Bakersfield Californian, an independently owned daily and Agrifuture Inc., a Bakersfield-based agricultural concern.    J.K. Stanners, president and chief executive of the Californian and chairman of Kenaf International, says kenaf &quot;can be very competitive&quot; with other newsprint sources. The proposed mill would be built in the area of McAllen, Texas, and would produce 215,000 metric tons of newsprint annually, he says.    Kenaf International owns 60% of a joint venture formed for the Texas project, and CIP owns 40%. Mr. Stanners said the venture also would seek to secure equity positions in the project from publishers, a common practice in the construction of newsprint mills. A final decision is expected next year, said a CIP spokesman. </TEXT></DOC>
