He stressed dialogue again later in talking to the nation'sseven bishops, calling Moslems ``important partners'' with``authentic religious values that we need to recognize andrespect.''   ``Dialogue with them is not always made easy, nor desired byall, and we sometimes find it difficult to find a common languageand representatives,'' he told the bishops. ``It is here thatChristian generosity should help us to be realistic and courageous,all at once.''   About 1 percent of the nation's 8 million people are RomanCatholic, while Moslems make up about 70 percent.   The pontiff was greeted by Bamako's Archbishop Luc Sangare andMali's Moslem President Moussa Traore, who welcomed him as the``king of peace and freedom.''   The pope and the president, dressed in a robin's-egg blueboubou, or loose, flowing garmet, paused and applauded a group ofdancers from the animist Dogon tribe of northern Mali, who woregrass skirts, painted wooden masks and ankle bracelets made ofbottle caps.   A cacophony of drums and balafons, the traditional Africanxylophone, blended with the chants and cheers from the colorfullydressed crowd.   The pope met with workers at the Sacred Heart Cathedral in theafternoon and prayed for victims and families of those who died inthe crash Thursday of an Avianca jetliner in Cove Neck, N.Y., andin the storm that struck Europe last week.   At dusk, while the Moslem call to prayer spread over the cityfrom the central mosque, more than 25,000 people packed thebleachers at Bamako's sports stadium for the papal Mass.   Earlier, the pope completed his visit to the nation ofGuinea-Bissau by blessing disfigured patients at a leper hospitaland making an impromptu visit to the mud hut of a village family.   At the leper hospital in Cumura, a bush village six milesoutside the capital of Bissau, he told the 250 leprosy victims, ``Ilove you very much.''   ``Don't let yourselves be beaten ... (Have) trust and courage inmedical progress and in the good will of those who offer you love.I will never forget you,'' he told those seated on wooden benchesoutside the hospital.   His visit was scheduled to call attention on World Day ofLeprosy to the disease that afflicts up to 15 million peopleworldwide, one-third of them in Africa.   The pope called for an international effort to conquer thedisease.   En route to the Bissau airport, John Paul asked to stop at aclay hut where he visited an elderly man and his family. Thepontiff noted that poverty as much as totalitarian politicscompromises freedom.   A Vatican representative with the pope gave the family $100.   Africa's sub-Saharan nations, including Guinea-Bissau and Mali,are locked in a struggle with disease, illiteracy, and hungerwrought by drought, political mismanagement and the spreadingdesert.   Mali, one of Africa's 10 poorest countries with a per capitaincome of $210 per year, has the second-highest infant mortalityrate in the world. Life expectancy is 47 years.   Only about 20 percent of the people can read and write, andeducation is one of the main activities of the Catholic Church,which runs 42 primary and secondary schools and accepts children ofall religions. Only 25 percent of Malian children attend school,and one-fourth of them are taught by the church.   The pope continues his eight-day trip Monday in Burkina Faso. Heheads to Chad before returning to Rome on Thursday.</TEXT></DOC>
