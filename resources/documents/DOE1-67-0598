Reports on the engine trouble are now reported. We,therefore, experimented with cetane, diesel oil, marine fuel oil andF.C.C. bottom base oil, and tested the combustion characteristics ofoil drops from the integrated value of hour-average temperature and time.Results are as following: Oil drop size of cetane and diesel oil decreasesby time, but changes of oil drops of marine fuel oil and residual fueloil were fluctuating. Combustion time of sample oil gets shorter forthe higher initial heating with higher average rate of combustion, butthe marine fuel oil and residual oil are susceptive to the ignition delayand the combustion time. Rate of combustion and its efficiency was higherin the order of cetane, diesel oil, marine fuel oil, and the residualoil, from high to low. ( 17 figs, 4 tabs, 24 refs )</TEXT></DOC>
