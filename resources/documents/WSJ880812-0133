Toshiba Machine's U.S. subsidiary, Toshiba Machine Co., America, has sales and maintenance responsibilities in the U.S. It has 85 employees.    The U.S. trade bill passed by the Senate last week and sent to President Reagan, who has said he will sign it, bars Toshiba Machine from exporting to the U.S. for three years. It also bars the machine company's parent, the electronics giant Toshiba Corp., from doing business with U.S. government agencies for three years. The sanctions are in reaction to Toshiba Machine's illicit sale to the Soviet Union of military sensitive milling equipment.    &quot;We understand it is only a matter of time now that the bill will be signed and take effect,&quot; said Hiroshi Yamaguchi, Toshiba Machine's senior spokesman. &quot;So, whether we like it or not, we will have to trim down the U.S. unit sooner or later.&quot;    Exports to the U.S. accounted for 12.2% of Toshiba Machine's sales in the year ended March 31. The company's total sales are likely to increase in the current fiscal year because of brisk domestic demand, Mr. Yamaguchi said. </TEXT></DOC>
