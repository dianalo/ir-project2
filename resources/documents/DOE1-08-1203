<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-08-1203 </DOCNO><TEXT>A compact, simple and reliable combustor-gasifier system has been developedunder a previous EEC contract (ESE-R-087-B). Very high and stable solidcirculation rates have been obtained (1000 kg/s square m) between thecells. Biomass pellets have been used successfully as a fuel. Howeverthe gas mixing cells ranges between 20 and 40%. It is the goal of thepresent project to reduce this gas transfer while the solid flux willremain high. Another goal of the project is to increase the flexibilityof the system versus several downstream processes like a dual fuel dieselengine, chemical synthesis processes, etc., by using catalysts or bytrying operation under pressure.</TEXT></DOC>
