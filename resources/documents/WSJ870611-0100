It establishes our very perception of economic, social and political realities and subtly affects our attitudes toward those realities.    Oddly enough, though conservatives are quick to lament the &quot;debasement&quot; and &quot;vulgarization&quot; of our language, they are extraordinarily slow to realize its political, as distinct from its cultural, abuse. As a result, liberals and socialists have, over recent decades, made a highly successful takeover bid, so that the words we unthinkingly use end up being their words, with their connotations, insinuating the exclusive legitimacy of their way of looking at the world.    Sometimes, little more is involved than a kind of superficial, though effective, verbal intimidation. Thus, one notes that Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee on the possible risks involved in the Persian Gulf if, as planned, we place 11 Kuwaiti tankers under the protection of the American flag. He said: &quot;There are no absolute guarantees that such an operation will be casualty free, or that Iran will not escalate the sea war, which will present us with further difficult choices.&quot;    I would call your attention to those final words. What &quot;difficult choices&quot; can Adm. Crowe be referring to? Presumably, if Iran attacks ships flying the American flag it would provoke so punitive a response from our superior naval and air power that Iran would promptly cease and desist. Where's the difficulty? Surely the overwhelming majority of Americans would feel no reluctance to respond to such a provocation -- still another provocation -- by the ayatollah and his cohorts. If this represents a &quot;difficult choice&quot; for our Chiefs of Staff, what would be an easy one?    And why that most peculiar reference to the absence of an &quot;absolute guarantee&quot; against our suffering any casualties? Is Adm. Crowe under the impression that he is at the head of a uniformed Peace Corps? It goes without saying that in any military operation casualties are likely. What kind of military leadership is it that thinks in terms of an &quot;absolute guarantee&quot; against them? What kind of appropriate criterion is this for military planners?    It is clear what happened. Adm. Crowe surely does not ordinarily talk this way. (At least one hopes not!) But he knew he was appearing before a Senate committee dominated by Democrats who are either isolationist-minded, as so many liberal Democrats are today, or are minded to be anti-Reagan at any cost, as practically all Democrats seem to be today. So he tailored his language to suit their political attitudes.    What he surely did not realize is that, in doing so, he vindicated those very attitudes as the appropriate context for any discussion of projecting American power, anywhere, at any time. Since one may reasonably assume that Adm. Crowe is not an advocate of American powerlessness, he ended up losing the debate on this issue at the very outset, by permitting himself to be maneuvered into using self-defeating language.    Such mindless passivity before linguistic-political challenges (which are not even perceived as such) is common enough, with the consequences being obvious enough. But there are more subtle and complex challenges that, by now, one fails even to recognize and identify as such.    I am struck, for instance, with the easy way the terms &quot;disadvantaged&quot; and &quot;underprivileged&quot; have over the past 15 years been inserted into our everyday parlance. They are loaded terms -- just how loaded can be seen by substituting other, apparently equally appropriate, words to describe those same people. &quot;Poor,&quot; for instance. Why prefer &quot;disadvantaged&quot; to this older, perfectly good word?    Well, there is a powerful reason for such preference -- if your concept of a welfare state is one in which the government not only helps those who are not in a position to help themselves, or whom we discover to have fallen through holes in the &quot;safety net&quot; of social programs, but is also given the task of striving for greater equality of condition as regards income, wealth and educational achievement. In short, it is a term with a definite tilt toward egalitarianism. You don't have to be a socialist or a social-democrat in the U.S. today, arguing explicitly for extensive equality. You can be a &quot;liberal&quot; focusing public attention on the &quot;disadvantaged&quot; and &quot;underprivileged.&quot; This latter position is so much more convenient.    If we are talking about people who are &quot;poor&quot; (or, perhaps, &quot;handicapped&quot;) we impose upon ourselves a moral obligation to help such people cope with their difficult lives, to the degree that we can sensibly do so without further complicating those lives. This conception of the welfare state, based on the Judeo-Christian tradition, is one that conservatives ought to find acceptable. True, conservatives would prefer to emphasize the ways in which such people can be influenced to help themselves, and would also like to leave a large area open to private philanthropy. But in a large, complex, dynamic society such as we live in today, most conservatives would agree that there is a positive role, however minimal, for government.    But note: When we define people as &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;handicapped,&quot; we morally obligate ourselves. We do not give those people &quot;rights&quot; to our own property and resources. The whole point of making them &quot;disadvantaged&quot; or &quot;underprivileged&quot; is to identify inequality with injustice, inequality with inequity -- to imply that they have been denied privileges and advantages that are theirs by right, and that they therefore have a legitimate grievance against the rest of us. This grievance can be addressed only if the welfare state goes beyond helping them with their problems and actively seeks to redistribute income and wealth in the direction of greater equality, and signals us that we ought to feel guilty to the degree that this mission is not accomplished.    This attitude, once established, quickly spills over national frontiers. &quot;Underdeveloped&quot; and &quot;less developed&quot; nations, previously merely &quot;poor,&quot; now join the ranks of the &quot;underprivileged&quot; of the earth. Here again, there is no doubt that a relatively affluent nation such as the U.S. has a moral obligation to help poorer countries when they suffer those catastrophes curiously called &quot;acts of God&quot; -- e.g., floods, famines, epidemics.    But such help is never the issue today. Instead, in one international forum after another, we Americans are informed in no uncertain terms that disparities of income and wealth among nations, whatever their cause, are inherently unjust, that poor countries have a &quot;right&quot; not to be poor, that they have a legitimate grievance against us so long as those disparities exist, and that all affluent nations ought to feel ashamed of themselves for being affluent while others are not.    All of this is the result of the seepage of socialist attitudes and assumptions into the liberalism of yesteryear, with a consequent deformation of our political discourse. It helps explain the notorious phenomenon whereby our media casually refer to &quot;right-wing&quot; congressmen but never to &quot;left-wing&quot; congressmen, to &quot;ultra-right&quot; politicians and publicists but never to &quot;ultra-left&quot; politicians and publicists. Isn't it revealing that our major newspapers and news magazines have no trouble labeling Pat Robertson a &quot;right-wing&quot; candidate but find it unthinkable that they should refer to Jesse Jackson as a &quot;left-wing&quot; candidate, which he unquestionably is?    Many conservatives, properly outraged at this situation, react by denouncing the &quot;liberal bias&quot; in our media. Such general denunciations are a waste of time. The media don't think they are biased, don't know they are biased, don't begin to comprehend the complaint, which they interpret simply as an effort at intimidation.    This is because liberalism has, in the past quarter century, moved so decisively to the left portion of the political spectrum that liberals -- and most journalists do regard themselves as liberals -- simply cannot distinguish what is liberal from what is &quot;left.&quot; That is why, though both Michael Harrington and John Kenneth Galbraith have publicly declared themselves to be socialists, the media persist in calling them &quot;liberals.&quot; For the media to perceive you as &quot;ultra-left&quot; these days, you have to commit an egregious act of terrorism -- and even that might not suffice, if you dress up the act in the right kind of rhetoric.    How does a conservative cope with this reality? Well, the only serious way of coping is to take words seriously, and to appreciate the fact that any war of ideas or ideologies is, above all, a war of words -- a war in which conservative defeat is not inevitable.    An example comes to mind. Sen. Claiborne Pell, a liberal Democrat, in a recent commencement address at New York University, is reported to have said: &quot;It is communism, not capitalism, that contains the seeds of its own destruction.&quot; The sentiment is banal, but the use of that word &quot;capitalism&quot; is not. Ten years ago, Sen. Pell might have said &quot;democracy,&quot; or &quot;a free society&quot;; he would never have dreamed of saying &quot;capitalism.&quot; He could use that term today because he has seen it used, as a matter of course, in Time, Newsweek, in book titles, and even in corporate advertisements.    Such usage is no accident, but resulted from a conspiracy among a handful of neoconservative intellectuals -- Michael Novak, Peter Berger, George Gilder, Norman Podhoretz and (I am pleased to say) myself. We felt the need for a word to describe the kind of economic and social order we favored. Socialists believed in socialism. What did we believe in? We did not like &quot;free enterprise,&quot; with its Darwinian connotations, and &quot;market economy&quot; we felt was too narrow. So we decided, after considerable debate and with some misgivings, to be belligerent and to take the term &quot;capitalism,&quot; a term invented and used by socialists, as our own. We were tired of being accused of supporting capitalism. Henceforth, we would advocate it.    It has worked, though it has taken a while. And it has even had an international resonance. In France, the mother country of the socialist idea, the term &quot;le capitalisme&quot; has now acquired a legitimacy and a positive association that no one would have dared forecast a few years ago.    Another couple of such small victories, and the war of the words will be fought on less unequal terms.    ---   Mr. Kristol is the John M.
