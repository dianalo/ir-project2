Mandela was interrupted by standing applause several times, oncewhen he said the U.S. economic sanctions against South Africashould not be lifted now. ``The purpose for which they were imposedhas not been achieved.''   Mandela did not specifically address his support of violence asa last-resort alternative in the struggle for freedom, but hereminded his audience of the many Americans who died for freedom inthe Revolutionary War, the Civil War and two world wars.   Mandela was greeted with prolonged applause as he made his wayinto the chamber. He beamed a wide smile as he mounted the podium.   Despite the public show of support for Mandela, some members didnot attend as a show of protest over Mandela's support for Cuba,Libya and the Palestine Liberation Organization and his backing ofarmed struggle.   Conservative Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., said heboycotted the speech as a ``matter of principle.'' Rep. LarrySmith, D-Fla., also stayed away.   Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., said he was disappointedMandela continued to advocate armed struggle. ``Who is the realNelson Mandela?'' he asked.   But other praised the speech. ``It's an extraordinary day,''said Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif. He said lawmakers heard ``amagnificent black man ... speak powerfully and eloquently as a manof peace.''   In his speech, Mandela said, ``We would be fools to believe thatthe road ahead of us is without major hurdles. Too many among ourwhite compatriots are slaves in the ideology of racism to admiteasily that change must come.''   He added, pointedly: ``For those who care to worry aboutviolence in our country as we do, it is at these forces that theyshould focus their attention.''   He credited the economic sanctions in place against South Africafor contributing to his release from prison after 27 years. Andsaid they should remain in place until a new constitution is passedand democratic elections held.   And he clearly preferred to talk of his vision of a peacefulfuture:   ``Let us keep our arms locked together so that we form a solidphalanx against racism to ensure that that day comes now. By ourcommon actions, let us ensure that justice triumphs without delay.''   Envisioning a day when the white-minority government has beenreplaced, Mandela said the country's economy must be transformed.But, addressing administration concerns about his socialisteconomic views, Mandela said, ``The ANC holds no ideologicalpositions which dictate that it must adopt a policy ofnationalization.''   Mandela asked for resources for the ANC, even though U.S.officials say President Bush has been reluctant to provide directfinancial support for the ANC because the group has refused torenounce violence.   ``Here we have friends. Here we have fighters against racism whofeel hurt because we are hurt, who seek our success because we,too, seek the victory of democracy over tyranny.''   In their struggle for democracy, Mandela said, black SouthAfricans are following the examples of George Washington, AbrahamLincoln and Thomas Jefferson, as well as black American leaderslike Martin Luther King Jr.   ``Our people demand democracy. Our country, which continues tobleed and suffocate, needs democracy,'' he said.   Mandela had a separate breakfast meeting with members of theCongressional Black Caucus and singer Harry Belafonte.   Later, several thousand jubilant people gathered for a noontimerally to honor Mandela on Pennsylvania Avenue. Although organizerssaid Mandela might stop, he did not, waving instead from hislimousine.   Mandela, who met with Bush on Monday, was wrapping up his visitto Washington later in the day after several other publicappearances, including an afternoon outdoor rally and an eveningspeech to a crowd that paid $10 or $25 per ticket. In between, hewas meeting with congressional leaders.   He was traveling to Atlanta on Wednesday, the next stop on hiseight-city tour of the United States.   Mandela, 71, was honored at a dinner Monday night hosted bySens. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate IntelligenceCommittee, and Terry Sanford, D-N.C.   Meanwhile Monday, Senate leaders decided to postpone aprocedural vote on a civil rights bill, opposed by theadministration, scheduled for today. Republicans complained thatthe vote was a ploy by Democrats to embarrass them during Mandela'svisit.</TEXT></DOC>
