Ask them ifthey believe in opening up a small strip of land on Alaska'sremote northeast coast to oil exploration and drilling. Theissue may well set off the most contentious debate of theyear in Congress.   The 20-by-100-mile coastal plain of the Arctic NationalWildlife Refuge is basically a frozen desert, wind-swept andbleak even in summer. There are no trees, few flowers, and alot of mosses and lichens. Yet this area may well conceal thelast major oil reservoir in North America, one that couldrival the nearby Prudhoe Bay discovery that now produces 25%of the nation's domestic oil. The Interior Department putsthe chances of a major find at one in five as against the oilindustry's typical success rate of one in 50.</LP><TEXT>   Some 92% of the Maine-sized ANWR area is alreadyoff-limits to development. The rest was specifically setaside by Congress in 1980 for possible oil exploration. Butthis hasn't stopped environmental groups from trying to slapa wilderness label on even this small remainder. The area isused by migrating caribou and other wildlife.   Alaska officials and local Eskimo leaders almostunanimously back development of the coastal strip. They saythe Prudhoe Bay field shows that a balance can be struckbetween the needs of environmental protection and economicgrowth. In the 12 years since drilling began there, the localcaribou herd has tripled in size to 18,000 animals. The800-mile-long Alaska pipeline has had a superb safety record.   Nor would oil exploration and production disturb much ofANWR. With Prudhoe Bay as a guide, the best estimates arethat less than 23 square miles -- 0.1% of ANWR's total area-- would be affected by drilling pads, roads and otherfacilities. All would be removed carefully and the groundreseeded once exploration or drilling was completed.   Bills that would have allowed exploration in ANWR'scoastal plain were passed by both House and Senate committeesin 1989. Then the Exxon Valdez disaster wiped ANWR off thelegislative map. The Gulf crisis has brought the issue frontand center again. Last August, the Senate passed an amendmentthat would open up ANWR and other non-wilderness federallands to oil and gas development if oil imports rise above50% of domestic demand. They are now 45%.   But development of ANWR makes sense regardless of how muchoil America imports, and Congress will take up the issue inearnest early this year. The Beltway environmental groups arefighting to keep all of it in perpetual cold storage. AWilderness Society official says there is a &quot;need to protectthe land not just for wildlife and human recreation, but justto have it there.&quot;   That is environmental overreaching. It ignores the needsof real Americans, many with low incomes, who have to driveto work every day to support their families and will probablynever have the means or the desire to fly 800 miles north ofAnchorage, Alaska, and appreciate the stark, wind-sweptterrain of ANWR.   Sensible conservationists believe that opening up a smallsliver of Alaska's tundra for oil exploration simplyrecognizes that the welfare of human beings should also be afactor in environmental policy.</TEXT></DOC>
