The charges, expected to total $150 million, will include the cost of retiring some high-interest debt, writing down some assets and establishing a reserve for the sale of some units.    Household also said it expects to report 1986 profit of about $205 million, or about $4.25 a fully diluted share, during the second week of February. In 1985, Household had profit from continuing operations of $167.9 million, or $2.82 a fully diluted share. Profit from discontinued operations of $43 million made net income for the year $210.9 million, or $3.54 a fully diluted share.    Household didn't project fourth-quarter profit. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, it reported profit of $156.9 million, or $3.17 a fully diluted share.    Household, a financial services and manufacturing concern, last month sold National to an investor group for $459 million. </TEXT></DOC>
