Ed Wolfe, the State Department's ambassador for oceans andfisheries, told a House subcommittee that an inter-agency taskforce was examining the policy, which allows for the boarding of aforeign vessel only after receiving permission from the governmentwhose flag the ship flies.   ``Because of the recent incident invovling Taiwan, we arereviewing our high-seas boarding policy,'' Wolfe said. ``I amconfident we will come up with something.''   Wolfe said the United States has jurisdiction over such fish assalmon that were born in U.S. waters and return there to spawnafter several years in the ocean.   ``The problem is what we do with that jurisdiction,'' Wolfe saidduring a hearing before the fisheries, wildlife conservation andenvironment subcommittee of the House Merchant Marine and FisheriesCommittee.   Wolfe said the present policy is based on ``customaryinternational law'' and in a brief interview after the hearingdeclined to discuss possible alternatives.   ``We are exploring various possibilities,'' Wolfe said.   Northwest lawmakers said that fishermen in Alaska, Washingtonand Oregon are becomming increasingly angry over what the illegalcatch of U.S. salmon by foreign driftnet fleets from Tawian, SouthKorean and Japan.   Alaska Republican Rep. Don Young said the only way to get theattention of the three countries with driftnet fleets would be toimpose trade sanctions.   Coast Guard Rear Adm. Ted Leland told the subcommittee that U.S.personnel who boarded the Taiwanese vessel in the North Pacificlast month found ``no conclusive evidence'' it had been illegallyfishing for salmon.   The cutter Jarvis shadowed the Taiwanese ship for more than 700miles before Coast Guard personnel were given permission from thegovernment of Tawian to board. Efforts to find the ship's net,which was abandoned after the vessel was first spotted by theJarvis, were unsucessful.   Under various diplomatic agreements, driftnet fishing has beenlimited to areas well away from the migration routes of salmon.   Since Congress enacted a law in late 1987, the State Departmenthas been trying to negotiate driftnet monitoring and enforcementagreements with each of the three countries.   If such agreements are not concluded by June 29, the presidentcan then impose trade restrictions on imports of fish products fromthose countries.   American fishermen claim that vessels from Taiwan, South Koreaand Japan are using driftnets to illegally snare millions of tonsof salmon under the guise of squid fishing. Fishing groups havesaid the illegal fishing has already affected salmon runs inAlaska, Washington and Oregon.   An estimated 700 fishing boats from Taiwan, South Korea andJapan use driftnets, which can stretch 35 miles in length and covermore than 30,000 square miles of ocean on any given day.   Environmentalists have likened driftnet fishing to clear cuttinga forest and charge the nets are responsible for the deaths ofthousands of porpoises, seals, seabirds and other marine lifeannually.</TEXT></DOC>
