No emergency action had been taken as of Friday, despite speculation that the exchange was planning to reduce the limit on individual traders' holdings in pork belly contracts for delivery this month.    Supplies of frozen bellies have been tight most of this year because of a smaller than expected slaughter of hogs. The result has been a 17% increase in the May futures contract price since early March.    Pork belly futures prices fell late last week, tumbling as much as the permissible daily limit of two cents a pound, or $2 a hundred-weight. Profit-taking and speculation that Merc officials had met with some buyers in the market, asking them to close out their positions, helped fuel the selling, according to an analyst who asked not to be identified.    Trading in the contract ends May 21, although deliveries against it continue until May 29. Supplies available for delivery against the Merc's contracts are scarce. Contracts calling for delivery of 68.7 million pounds of bellies, or uncured slabs of bacon, were outstanding on the Merc as of last Thursday, the most recent data available. As of May 3, only 10.4 million pounds were certified by the exchange for delivery against its futures contract.    In February, the Merc did place a limit on traders' holdings in that month's contract. </TEXT></DOC>
