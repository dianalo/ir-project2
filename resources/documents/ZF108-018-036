 Many of them offer what can rightfully becalled &quot;integrated&quot; network management systems, stations, centers, ormanagers.andP;  They're integrated because they combine many managementcapabilities--from performance monitoring to audit-trail accounting tochanging configuration parameters--into one package.andP;  Whatever a vendor callsits integrated network management product, it's designed to provide networkmanagers with the up-to-date, real-time information they need to understand,and thus manage, better the network's operation.andM;Network ManagementandM;Traditionally, network management products have been divided into fivecategories:andM;* Security management (or variations of password-protection schemes).andM;* Performance management (monitoring network capacity and loading).andM;* Accounting (audit trail) management (capturing and allocating costs of thenetwork to network users).andM;* Fault management (troubleshooting, finding and correcting failingequipment).andM;* Configuration management (network installation, booting, trackinghardware/software configurations).andM;Providing as many of these capabilities as possible in one software packageis the goal of vendors offering integrated network management systems.andP;  Thesesystems, usually made up of hardware and software components, offer agraphical look at all or parts of a network, both from a physical andstatistical point of view.andP;  They generally overlay the LAN's components on ageographical or logical map displayed on a color graphics monitor, andprovide a wide range of statistical information the LAN manager can use tofind out what's going on around the network, and then reconfigure thecomponents on the LAN to avoid potential future disaster.andM;An integrated network management product, unlike the myriad stand-aloneapplications available, could automatically tell a LAN manager that a serveror remote bridge is overworked, then allow taking that component out ofoperation, changing its operating parameters, then putting it back inservice.andP;  It could also let the manager see how many bad packets are crossingan Ethernet--thus slowing it down--or set danger thresholds thatautomatically beed or display an on-screen message when a network componentis experiencing trouble or about to fail.andM;An ever-increasing number of these integrated systems are now or soon will beon the market.andP;  Not all of them are appropriate for every network, and infact none may be appropriate for a particular installation.andP;  Most likely,however, one of these products can help you manage your network moreefficiently, in less time, and from a central location.andM;Integrated ManagersandM;Sun Microsystems (Mountain View, Calif.) used the Interop Conference at SanJose, Calif., in October to demonstrate its SunNet Manager (SNM), one of themore ambitious integrated systems available, for the first time.andP;  In additionto providing the SunNet Manager with its own proprietary network monitoringfacilities, which let a LAN manager analyze and control a Sun-based network,Sun also permits incorporating third-party &quot;proxy agents,&quot; managed objects,OS resources, and other network services, communications protocols, anddevices into the SunNet Manager evironment.andP;  These can add functionality--forexample, a properly written proxy agent could allow monitoring andcontrolling T-1 multiplexers via the SNM.andM;The SunNet Manager's core group of products, called the Open NetworkComputing (ONC), run in Sun's SunView operating environment on SPARCstations(Sun recommends running SunNet Manager on a Sun1 or 4/SPARCstation).andP;  Suncalls its ONC products &quot;a platform for the development of distributedapplications.&quot;andP;  A number of network services, including Sun's widely licensedNetwork File System (NSF), run on ONC.andM;SunNet Manager is made up of a basic set of event management tools andservices, a number of proxy agents, and a database.andP;  The management toolsoffer two application programmatic interfaces (APIs) that allow end-users andthird-party vendors to turn an existing management program into a proxy agentthat can work with the SNM (Sun provides an ONC-based library of servicesthat users can employ in creating their own agents).andM;When available, in the first quarter of 1990, the SNM will operate overTCP/IP networks and support the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP);migration to OSI is planned.andP;  Sun plans to add support for Digital's DECnetNetwork Information Control Exchange (NICE) protocol and Fiber DistributedData Interface (FDDI) for the SNM in the future.andM;The SunNet Manager offers a graphical interface based on Sun's Open Look,which uses icons, mouse controls and pull-down menus to manipulate on-screenobjects; Open Look and the SNM present all networked objects--from PCs toSPARCstations to internetwork bridges--and their status graphically as icons.andO;Users define networks and their components via a set of easy-to-use pull-downmenus; these menus can be custom-tailored so users can include a wide rangeof components within the network map generated and displayed by the SNM.andM;In operation, the SNM can automatically notify a network manager when anypre-defined &quot;event&quot; occurs--for instance, a server failure or disk drive usereaches a certain level.andP;  This warning can be a beep, a screen prompt,graphically highlighted icon or an electronic mail message.andM;The SunNet Manager also offers network performance monitoring, a keycapability for any integrated network management system.andP;  It canautomatically collect a variety of performance data--bandwidth or CPU use,for example--and present it in graphs or charts.andP;  The SNM stores this data ina &quot;flat file&quot; database, so the data can be easily exported to statisticalanalysis packages.andP;  These can show the network manager where bottlenecks orother potential problems are likely to occur.andM;Although designed to manage distributed workgroups, the addition of variousthird-party proxy agent applications allows expanding the SNM into anenterprisewide management tool.andP;  Fourteen vendors (see related box) havereleased or will soon release products that add wider network managementcapabilities to the SunNet Manager.andM;Single copies of SunNet Manager cost $10,000; discounts down to $4,000 areavailable for multiple-copy purchases.andM;As already noted, Sun isn't the only networking vendor offering an integratednetwork management system.andP;  Details on other vendors' integrated systemsfollow.andM;The WANmanagerandM;Vitalink's 802 WANmanager allows managing extended, or wide area, networkscomprised of the Fremont, Calif., vendor's link-level TransLAN Ethernetbridges.andP;  The Digital VAXstation-based (Ultrix) WANmanager lets a networkoperator monitor, analyze, and control the entire Vitalink WAN using a mouse,color icons, windows and pull-down menus.andP;  The WANmanager software is made upof a graphical user interface based on X Windows and a relational database(custom-tailored for Vitalink by Informix) &quot;sitting on top&quot; of a set ofcommunications modules.andP;  These modules, based on Digital Equipment's BridgeManagement Protocols (BMP), operate under Vitalink's own version of BMP,called VBMP, and provide WANmanager with its functionality.andM;According to Vitalink network management product manager Tim Lee-Thorp, themodules can be replacing them when newer, faster, more efficient protocolsare developed.andP;  The application is SNMP-compatible, so WANmanager can migrateto OSI when necessary.andM;The WANmanager gives users a topological rather than physical map of thenetwork, with the status of each bridge and the links between bridgesindicated in specific colors.andP;  Operators can change this map as they like.andM;Because the WANmanager primarly monitors and controls mostly Vitalink's ownproducts--it is also compatible with DEC's LAN Bridge 100 and ChipcomEtherModem II bridges--the WANmanager can automatically &quot;sense&quot; whatcomponents make up the network and &quot;learn&quot; the network's topology during itsinitial moments of operation.andP;  This takes about two minutes on a 100-nodeWAN, says Lee-Thorp; it also continually updates this network map as the WANchanges.andM;The WANmanager provides color-coded information that identifies busy,congested, or disabled bridges, and shows which network links are operatingor disabled.andP;  For example, a malfunctioning bridge flashes red rather thanthe normal blue (when an icon turns yellow, the bridge or link it representsis congested, but still operating).andM;With the WANmanager, an administrator can connect to any bridge on the WAN,make queries to and change the configuration of the bridge, display real-timelink and LAN use graphs, and access individual or multiple bridge alarmdatabases on the WAN.andM;WANmanager allows point and click control of the on-screen icons thatrepresent network components.andP;  For example, clicking on a bridge icondisplays an expanded view of pertinent information about that bridge; theadministrator can then take the bridge out of ervice, reconfigure it, andrestore it to the WAN.andP;  A manager can perform similar routines on the linksbetween bridges.andP;  WANmanager also permits opening multiple windows, allowinga network manager to configure both bridges on a single communication link atonce.andM;Vitalink says WANmanager requires a VAXstation configured with a minimum of 6megabytes of memory and at least a 154 MB hard disk drive, 19-inch colordisplay, 95 MB tape backup system and mouse.andM;9100 Management CenterandM;The Hughes LAN Systems (Mountain View, Calif.) 9100 Network Management Centeris an SN,P-compatible application that helps manage and control Hughes'proprietary networking products.andP;  Based on a relational database with SQLcapabilities that manage and provide access to data collected from across thenetwork, the 9100 software runs on any Sun 3 computer.andP;  Hughes recommendsrunning the 9100 on a Sun 3/80- 8-P2 using Sun OS 4.0, a quarter-inch SCSItape drive (Hughes supplies the 9100 software in quarter-inch tape format),and thin Ethernet and RS232 interfaces.andM;The 9100 Management Center provides database, configuration, performance,fault, and utilities management capabilities that can support networks of upto 18,000 devices including PCs, hots, terminal servers, and bridges.andP;  Thedatabase manager allows a LAN administrator to store and recall configurationdata and utilization history of each network node, assign new Internetaddresses, and create files for storing device attributes.andM;The 9100 logs and reports a variety of performance statistics collected bynetwork devices, such as Hughes terminal servers and bridges.andP;  It displaysnetwork traffic graphically, sorted by packet size, protocol, network use,primary packet sources, and popular packet destinations.andM;The 9100 Management Center also provides a configuration model that lets theadministrator configure large networks via SNMP, and will support CMIP whenstandardized.andM;The 9100 Management Center's fault-management facility records specifiedevents as alarms that indicate potential problems with a node or the networkconnection.andP;  These alarms trigger a flashing icon at the 9100 Centerworkstation.andP;  The Hughes Network Management Center sells for $14,000 perunit.andM;ACS 4800andM;Although the ACS can manage any SNMP-driven device, it operates optimallywithin a network made up of ACC's SCS Series 4000 internetwork devices; theseshare a common hardware architecture and all implement SNMP, thus allowingthe ACS 4800 to manage a wide range of ACC's internetworking bridges androuters.andM;The ACS 4800 offers users a graphical interface driven by a mouse and iconbuttons.andP;  These are used to move quickly between ACS 4800 functions, modifythe on-screen network manp and database, and monitor performance statistics.andM;Based on a Sun-3 or Sun-4/SPARCstation, the ACS 4800 allows the networkmanager to build a network map that shows only key network components, suchas those that need managing; individual network elements--bridges, hosts,routers, etc.--are color- and symbol-coded for easy on-screen recognition.andM;The ACS 4800 creates an information file for each network device in a&quot;rolodex-style&quot; database; this file can contain a broad range of performancestatistics.andM;When a network device doesn't respond to the ACS 4800 poll, the systemhighlights the problem area in red and begins a trap-directed pollingsequence.andP;  This process queries all the devices and links in the area of theproblem, thus helping to isolate the failure.andM;The ACS 4800 is available as a turnkey system with a Sun-4/SPARCstation for$27,420 or as a software-only application for $9,500.andM;DECnet NCPandM;Although not a stand-alone system, Digital Equipment's DECnet Network ControlProgram (NCP), when used in conjunction with a number of optiomalDEC-provided software tools, offers many capabilities.andM;NCP, which operates in tandem with two agents, the network managementlistener (NML) and a &quot;mirror,&quot; offers commands that allow examining andcontrolling all the layers of the DECnet architecture, and helps manage X.25features when available.andM;The NML accepts connections from NCP or user-written applications that&quot;speak&quot; the NICE network management protocol, an application layer protocolsimilar to the OSI CMIP.andM;Optional network management products available for use with DECnet includingan NMCC/DECnet Monitor, an NMCC/VAX Ethermin (Ethernet network integritymonitor), a LAN traffic monitor that presents traffic stats in graphicalform, a remote system manager, and remote bridge management software for usewith DEC's LANbridge 100.andM;LAN MANAGER/NetViewandM;IBM, in a use of terminology certain to confuse a lot of people, offers alocal network management product called the LAN Manager that, with oneexception, operates only in tandem with IBM's mainframe-based NetViewapplication.andM;The LAN Manager--it is offered in two versions, a LAN Manager V2.0 and a LANManager Entry V1.0--is what IBM calls a &quot;service point&quot; within IBM's overallnetwork management structure.andP;  A service point is one of four entitiesdefined within IBM's network management structure; the others are the focalpoint, entry point, and target.andM;A focal point, which sits atop a hierarchical model of a system (seeillustration), manages all of the remotely and locally attached networkcomponents in its domain from a central location.andP;  This centralizationprovides a global view of the network, and helps the network administratorbetter understand the relationships between network elements.andM;Service points make network components visible to the network manager sittingat the focal point.andP;  They handle the transportation of management databetween the network component--what IBM calls &quot;targets&quot;--and focal point.andP;  Anentry point moves both network management information and data around thenetwork.andP;  Within this structure, LAN Manager provides network managementfunctions as a service point.andM;Unlike earlier versions, LAN Manager Entry Version 1.0 does not provide auser interface at the local network level--management functions are availableonly at the central mainframe console running NewView Rel.andP;  3.andP;  The LANManager Entry V1.0 application can manage a single IBM Token-Ring or IBM PCNetwork (broadband or baseband) network segment; it supports both 4- and16-megabit-per-second token rings.andP;  By porting the Entry version from DOS toOS/2, IBM has eliminated DOS's 640-kilobyte memory restraints and the needfor a dedicated LAN management server.andM;The entry LAN Manager uses the OS/2 Communication Manager to communicate withNetView operating in a host, acting as a NetView agent; communication must bethrough a gateway--for example, a 3174--or SDLC.andM;In operation, the LAN Manager Entry V1.0 monitors the LAN for the detectionof hard errors; displays ring status information; and monitors functions suchas the detection of soft errors and the display of REM tables.andP;  It alsoprovides six commands that generate network and adapter profiles and status,permit removing an adapter from the network, and restarting the LAN Manager.andO;It can verify the connection between two stations, list the active adapters,and display or print an event log.andM;The LAN Manager Version 2.0 is designed for use in a mixed-LAN environment.andO;It also operates under OS/2 Extended Edition 1.1, and can be executed inthree modes:  as a stand-alone application, a LAN management agent forNetView running in a host, or as an independent application to NetView/PCV1.2 while providing service point functions for multiple applications orsubsystems.andM;The LAN Manager V2.0 allows a network administrator to specify a network nodehe or she wants monitored; when the node loses contact with the network, LANManager puts out an alert.andP;  This lets the LAN administrator closely monitorresources---printer servers, key file servers, or gateway servers--that areessential to the operation of the network.andM;LAN Manager V2.0 also allows applications to generate and send alerts to afocal point such as NetView.andP;  In addition, LAN Manager V2.0 allows users tochange a host of bridge configuration parameters, including hopcount limits,link passwords, bridge number, and LAN segment number per adapter.andM;Both versions of the LAN Manager require a PC or PS/2 running OS/2 ExtendedEdition 1.1.andP;  The Entry version also requires the computer to be equippedwith an IBM Token Ring adapter, an SLDC or IBM PS/2 multi-protocol adapter,500KB of memory, and a monitor.andM;LattisNet NMSandM;The LattisNet Network Management System (NMS) from SynOptics Communications(Mountain View, Calif.) gives LAN managers tools to manage network traffic,isolate network faults, and plan for network growth.andP;  The system manages thephysical and data-link layers of SynOptics' Ethernet LANs from a centralconsole, presenting real-time management data via a Windows-based interface.andM;The LattisNet NMS provides a programmable report generator, a real-timegraphics-based display of SynOptics System 3000 Concentrators that offers anexpanded view down to the board and port levels, and media-access control(MAC)-level statistics-gathering capabilities.andM;The LattisNet NMS allows identifying every network connection by its stationaddress and characterizing the station by its data activity and MAC-levelstatistics and errors.andP;  Network managers can program the system toautomatically disconnect stations that exceed predefined performance orMAC-level error thresholds.andM;LattisNet NMS modules are connected to a dedicated network management bus oneach SynOptics System 3000 Concentrator backplane; these modules gather andtransmit specific data to a central control console adapter, installed in anIBM PC/AT or compatible computer.andP;  SynOptics' LattisNet management softwarethen presents the data as a graphical map of the network.andM;The management functions built into the System 3000 Concentrators and hostmodules give the LAN manager a detailed picture of network activity at theconcentrator, module and port levels.andP;  The LattisNet NMS software reportgenerator creates a visual or printed log of network events, alerts,performance, and diagnostic data that the network manager wants.andM;The network manager can use these statistics in a wide range ofways--pinpointing overworked sections of the LAN, deciding where newconcentrators are needed, maintaining network integrity, and providing forcost-effective network growth.andM;LattisNet NMS components generally run about 10 percent of the networkper-port cost, say SynOptics officials; a LattisNet port typically ranges incosst from $350 to $500, depending on transceiver options, so the incrementalcost of a LattisNet Network Management System would be from $35 to $50 perport.andM;NCS AT/2andM;3Com(s Network Control Servers monitor and manage the Santa Clara, Calif.,andO;vendor's internetwork bridges and gateway and communications servers.andP;  3Comoffers two versions of the NCS: the 286-based NCS/AT, which can support 512servers, and the 68020 Sun-3-based NCS/2, which can handle up to 4,096servers; with few exceptions, they operate identically, and can be purchasedin a &quot;kit&quot; form that allows adding them to an existing system.andP;  Theycurrently operate under a proprietary protocol, but will support SNMP &quot;in thenear future,&quot; says 3Com.andM;The NCS products offer real-time monitoring of major network events, audittrail records with time/date stamps, and a variety of reports that displayand analyze the activity of 3Com bridges and communications and gatewayservers.andM;The NCS systems provide command-file facilities that let the LAN managerautomate sequences of network management tasks; they provide anaccess-control database that permits the manager to set up and manage networkaccess rules--that is, user rights to access particular components.andP;  Theyalso allow the manager to boot up a remote communication from a central NCS.andM;They also generate a variety of statistical data: peak traffic periods,session statistics (connection source, destination, and duration), networkutilization, and serial line traffic rates.andP;  The NCS/AT sells for $12,000,the NCS/2 $35,000.andM;DCA's ONMSandM;DCA's Open Network Management System (ONMS) gives network managers agraphical view of their entire, multivendor DCA network.andP;  ONMS can operate instandalone fashion or as a &quot;middle manager&quot; in tandem with large networkswith end-to-end network management systems.andM;Based on OSI CMIP/CMIS standards (it also supports ATandamp;T's Unified NetworkManagement Architecture), ONMS is made up of &quot;plug compatible&quot; softwaremodules that run on a Sun workstation.andP;  ONMS is controlled by a systemmanager that provides graphical, textual, and relational database facilities.andO;The ONMS manager works in cooperation with three agent-management modules tocontrol DCA's System 9000 backbone and Series 300 products as well CMIP-basedproducts.andP;  These modules transmit management information between the managerand other network components.andM;In operation, ONMS allows the network manager to view all or parts of thenetwork; point-and-click capabilities allow &quot;zooming&quot; in on specific elementsof the network.andP;  ONMS' Unify database controls storage and access to networkcomponents.andM;ONMS allows 10 users to access it simultaneously, and it can be accessed froma VT100 modem-equipped terminal for remote troubleshooting.andM;OpenViewandM;Hewlett-Packard's OpenView is a modular set of OSI-compliant networkmanagement tools that presents the user with a graphical map of a network.andO;The core product, HP OpenView Windows, runs on an HP Vectra PC that serves asa central management point for both local and wide area networks.andM;OpenView lets LAN managers monitor and troubleshoot local and remote networksthrough a comprehensive line of OpenView WAN and LAN modular products.andP;  Amongthose available are a bridge manager, a network command interpreter, a dataline monitor, an NS diagnostic monitor, a digital data test set, and aWindows developer's kit that allows creating custom-designed OpenView toolsthat are consistent with the OpenView interface.andM;Among the capabilities OpenView products provide are monitoring the status ofand collecting network-performance data on remote HP 3000 computer systemsand managing bridges to optimize communications bandwidth use.andM;HP plans to port its DOS-based OpenView products to UNIX, thus bringingmultitasking capabilities to its network management line.andM;OverVIEWandM;Proteon calls its OverVIEW a &quot;turnkey network management system designed formonitoring and controlling multivendor .andP;  .  .  multiprotocol internetworksystems.&quot;andP;  OverVIEW runs on a 286-based AT-compatible computer and supportsSNMP and its predecessor, SGMP.andM;It offers a multilevel, graphic view of a network, with zoom capabilities forisolation of problem areas.andP;  Its capabilities allow a network manager todefine an internetwork topology in hierarchical levels, simplifying what aregenerally complex internetworks.andM;By polling SNMP-compatible devices at regular intervals and collectingpertinent data, OverVIEW creates a real-time picture of the internetwork'soperation.andP;  OverVIEW's graphic representation of network elements lets amanager move rapidly from component to component.andM;OverVIEW provides WAN data definition for point-to-point serial, DDN, PDNX.25 and ARPANET DDN 1822 connections, and local data definitions for IEEE802 networks and Proteon's own token ring products.andM;OverVIEW's network database allows the network manager to add, modify, ordelete information about network segments and standard network items--forexample, node names, physical node addresses, and interface types.andP;  OverVIEWalso maintains a history of network alerts and important operational events.andO;An alert log, containing types of errors and traps generated by networknodes, is accessible from OverVIEW's color-coded network map.andM;One key OverVIEW features, called the performance monitor, presents a&quot;histogram&quot; of network traffic and errors.andP;  OverVIEW network managementstations are priced at $9,995.andM;NYSERNet's NMSandM;NYSERNet's Network Management Station (NMS) is an SNMP-compatible applicationthat consists of 18 tools, many of them graphical.andP;  These tools range fromtopology maps that help oversee network operation to tools that indentifyactivity of various network objects of interest to the network manager.andO;NYSERNet licenses its NMS source code to commercial and end-users.andM;ATandamp;T's STARLanandM;ATandamp;T's STARLan Network Manager (SNM) offers versions for managing bothSTARLan and STARLan 10 networks.andP;  SNM release 1.0, for STARLan-only networks,runs on ATandamp;T's 3B2 or 6386 WGS computer; SNM release 2.0, for STARLan andSTARLan 10 networks, runs on the 6386 WGS.andP;  A LAN manager can also operatethe program at an RS-232 terminal or an ATandamp;T PC6300 or compatible PC withterminal emulation.andM;The STARLan NMS allows LAN managers to administer and reconfigure networknodes, monitor equipment status and performance, collect and study reportdata, and troubleshoot and isolate network problems.andM;The STARLan SNM is based on an Informix on-line database, called the networkconfiguration database (NCD), that contains user-defined information aboutthe network.andP;  The database allows the LAN manager to display all or part ofthe network graphically, and show reports on a variety of events, such asnode error counts.andM;SNM's fault-detection-and-monitoring facilities give the administrator anumber of specific test procedures--for example, a communication test routinethat exchanges packets between the SNM and faulty node provides errorstatistics--for troubleshooting the network.andM;The product also produces daily reports and is easily customizable.andP;  Forinstance, the user can determine the node-status polling frequency, severitylevels for alarm generation, and the daily maintenance times.andM;WIN/MGTandM;Wollongong's SNMP-compatible Integrated Networking/Management (WIN/MGT)products give users the ability to analyze, monitor, alter, and manage largeinterconnected, multivendor networks.andP;  They also provide end-to-endmanagement services for gateways and hosts.andP;  Wollongong offers WIN/MGT agentsfor DOS, NCR Tower and Macintosh computers.andP;  Wollongong sells a WIN/MGTstation for the SunOS and agents for VMS and 386 STREAMs.andM;WIN/MGT allows network managers to determine the status of networkcomponents, review error situations in network links and interfaces, remotelyverify the location and status of network nodes and services, and detect andidentify the sources of incorrect routing information.andM;These capabilities let the WIN/MGT user diagnose and correct common faultsand bottlenecks, assure the availability of basic services, and automaticallygenerate network activity reports.andP;  A WIN/MGT station for the SunOS is pricedat $10,000; a WIN/MGT agent for VMS sells for $1,500 to $8,200, depending onthe CPU platform; the WIN/MGT agent for 386 STREAMS is $300.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
