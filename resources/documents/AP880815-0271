The report from the Greater Washington Research Center citesstrong growth in the area's private sector, in part fueled byfederal contracting, as the reason for the region's booming economyand consequently low unemployment.   Recent figures have put area unemployment at 2.7 percent,described by economists as a ``frictional'' rate because mostunemployed workers are in the processs of switching jobs ratherthan looking for them.   In addition to private sector growth, the area's growingimportance in high-tech, international and regional development isa strong impetus to local economic development, according to authorGeorge Grier.   ``Washington is becoming the hub of an emerging mega-metropolisthat has become identified as the `Chesapeake Crescent,''' whichcombines the economic power of the Baltimore, Washington, Richmondand Norfolk-Newport News areas, Grier said.   But it also faces problems recruiting workers, Grier says, ashousing costs increase and commuting distances lengthen, Grier says.   ``Many people who might otherwise consider locating in thegreater Washington area find themselves priced out of the market,''he says.   Making better use of resident resources could add up to 300,000people to the current labor force, Grier says.   Support systems to compensate for special needs, such asflexible and part-time schedules, could attract retired people whootherwise might not want to work, according to the report.   In addition, providing child care facilities would allow motherson welfare and other non-working mothers more freedom to work, thestudy says.</TEXT></DOC>
