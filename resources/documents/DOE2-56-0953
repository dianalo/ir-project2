The theoretical values of the hyperfinesplitting obtained from a solution of Dirac's equation for this modelof the muon, the positron, and the proton agree with the observed valuesin muonium, positronium, and hydrogen, to within the uncertainty in therespective QED corrections: except for an unaccounted factor of 2. Inhydrogen one also has to introduce the observed value of the magneticmoment of the proton. The singularity in Dirac's radial differentialequations is shifted from the origin, where it is located in the caseof flat space, to a pair of conjugate points on the imaginary axis ofthe radial coordinate. Consequently, the energy eigenvalues have a traceof an imaginary part, making the bound states of our model unstable.</TEXT></DOC>
