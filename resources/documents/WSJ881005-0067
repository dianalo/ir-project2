Dealers said buying interest surfaced to rescue the dollar whenever it dipped below 1.8600 marks, indicating that the U.S. unit has firm technical support around that level. The dollar didn't sink below 1.8575 marks during the session, and many traders now identify 1.8580 marks as an &quot;unbreakable&quot; floor this week, at least until Friday's release of the U.S. September employment report.    Selling of sterling, meanwhile, occupied center stage during yesterday's lackluster dealings, as recent weakness in petroleum prices and news that the Kuwait Investment Office may have to shed a large amount of its shares in British Petroleum Co. took their toll on the pound.    Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at 1.8649 marks, up from 1.8615 late Monday in New York. The U.S. unit was also at 133.38 yen, down from 133.68 yen. Sterling traded at $1.6952, off from $1.7020.    In Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar opened at 133.40 yen, up from Tuesday's close of 133.15 yen.    The United Kingdom government decided to order the Kuwait Investment Office to reduce its holding in BP to 9.9% from 21.68% over a period of around 12 months, to avoid a possible conflict of interest resulting from Kuwait's membership in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Many dealers in Europe thought the Kuwaitis, angered by the decision, would transfer the revenue from the eventual sale of BP assets from pounds to another currency -- most probably dollars -- and invest them in a country other than the U.K.    When news of the decision reached European trading rooms, dealers dumped the U.K. unit, driving it as low as $1.6920. But the pound regained some ground against the dollar during the New York session as traders reconsidered the possible effects of the Kuwaiti sale.    In general, traders in New York thought their European counterparts jumped the gun when they sold off the pound after the announcement. Said one sterling dealer at Barclay's Bank in New York: &quot;Sure, it might hurt the pound if the Kuwaitis decide to take their money out of the country, but they may just decide to put their pounds into other investments in the U.K. At this point it's far too early to tell what they will decide to do. Only the Kuwaitis can say.&quot;    Further, she added, the British government said the timing of the BP sale should be subject to some flexibility in light of volatile stock-market conditions, implying that the divestiture may not take place for some time.    Dealers noted, however, that other developments, such as the recent decline in crude-oil prices, have contributed to the pound's weakness, as Britain is an exporter of oil. The near-term West Texas Intermediate November contract was unchanged on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, closing at $13.05 a barrel.    The oil market apparently took little solace from reports that Prince Bandar Idn Sultan, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the U.S., said his country &quot;categorically&quot; denies rumors circulating in financial and commodity markets that the Middle Eastern kingdom is pulling out of OPEC.    The Saudis had announced Monday that they wouldn't limit their oil production to their OPEC quota limit as long as other OPEC members were exceeding their respective quotas. The announcement had prompted speculation that the kingdom might be planning to abandon the cartel.    On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery gained 60 cents to settle at $398.10 an ounce in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.1 million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Wednesday, gold was quoted at $398.30 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
