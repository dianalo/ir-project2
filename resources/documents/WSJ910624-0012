In a 5-4 decision, the high court upheld theconstitutionality of an Indiana public indecency law used toprohibit nude dancing in a South Bend bar and adultbookstore. Justice David Souter cast the pivotal fifth votein the case, which almost certainly would have come out theopposite way if William Brennan, whom Mr. Souter succeededlast year, hadn't retired.</LP><TEXT>   Free-speech advocates said the decision reflected anominous trend. &quot;This case isn't about nude dancing; it's moreabout this Supreme Court recognizing that expressive conductis protected by the First Amendment and then saying,basically, `We don't care,'&quot; said Philip Gutis of theAmerican Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU filed a&quot;friend-of-the-court&quot; brief opposing the Indiana law.   But Richard Ruda, chief counsel for a coalitionrepresenting state, county and local officials, said: &quot;It'san important case because of its clear affirmation of thestates' right to exercise their authority to regulate in thisarea.&quot; At least 47 states have some type of law barringpublic indecency; courts in at least seven of those stateshave upheld broad applications of the statutes to prohibitnude dancing.   The Indiana law was challenged by two South Bendbusinesses that featured dancing and by three women who saidthey wanted to dance without having to wear pasties andG-strings, as required by the state. The businesses anddancers failed in their effort to get the law invalidated bya federal trial judge. But a federal appeals court in Chicagoreversed that decision, concluding that nude dancing is&quot;inherently expressive&quot; and as such is constitutionallyprotected.   Five justices said the appeals court erred. But theyexpressed this view in three splintered opinions on how muchconstitutional protection to afford conduct when it iscombined with expression to form what the high court hascalled &quot;symbolic speech.&quot;   Chief Justice William Rehnquist, in an opinion joined byJustices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy, wrote thatnude barroom-style dancing falls &quot;within the outerperimeters&quot; of the First Amendment's guarantee of freespeech, but &quot;only marginally so.&quot; Having minimized theconstitutional stakes in the case, Justice Rehnquist saidIndiana's law passes muster because it &quot;furthers asubstantial government interest in protecting order andmorality.&quot; The state's goal, he added, &quot;is unrelated to thesuppression of free expression.&quot;   Robert O'Neil, a First Amendment scholar at the Universityof Virginia's Thomas Jefferson Center, called the notion of&quot;marginally&quot; protected speech &quot;new and potentiallydangerous.&quot; Although adopted by only three justices and thuslacking precedent-setting authority, the idea stilleventually could be applied to &quot;nude performances withartistic merit,&quot; such as operas or ballet, Mr. O'Neil said.   Justice Souter wrote a separate, concurring opinion tostress that in his view, protecting subjective moralstandards isn't a sufficient justification for barringsymbolic speech. Instead, he deemed the Indiana lawconstitutional because it serves the &quot;state's substantialinterest in combatting the secondary effects&quot; of nude eroticdancing, such as prostitution, sexual assault and relatedcrimes. Justice Souter said states don't have to prove anyconnection between X-rated entertainment and crime.   This is the second time Justice Souter has provided thefifth vote to restrict speech in a critical First Amendmentcase. In a decision last month, he was one of five justiceswho voted to uphold a federal regulation prohibiting familyplanning clinics that receive federal funds from providingwomen information about abortion.   Justice Antonin Scalia also wrote a concurring opinionupholding the Indiana statute, but he said that nude dancingis strictly conduct and doesn't deserve any First Amendmentprotection.   Justice Byron White, in a dissent joined by JusticesThurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens,contended that Indiana intended to restrict not just conductbut the emotional or erotic messages conveyed by womendancing without clothes. Such efforts to restrict the contentof symbolic speech require &quot;the most exacting scrutiny,&quot;including demonstration of a &quot;compelling&quot; state interest,Justice White wrote. No such interest had been shown, heargued. (Barnes vs. Glen Theatre)   Separately, the Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that localgovernments may go further than the federal government inregulating pesticide use.   The town of Casey, Wis., and Wisconsin's public advocatehad appealed a 4-3 state Supreme Court ruling that localregulation of pesticides is pre-empted by the FederalInsecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act.   The lawsuit was filed by a landowner who challenged a 1985ordinance adopted by Casey officials. Under the ordinance,the landowner was denied a permit for aerial spraying and wasallowed to use ground spraying on only a limited portion ofhis property.   The question of whether the federal law leaves room foradditional regulation by local governments has been decideddifferently by a number of state and federal courts. TheSupreme Court's decision resolves this conflict. (Wisconsinvs. Mortier)   ----   Stephen Wermiel contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
