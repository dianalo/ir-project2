The book also says that Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, in atelephone conversation with Marilyn Monroe, offered to divorce thepresident if the actress would agree to marry him and move into theWhite House.   The biography by C. David Heymann, ``A Woman Named Jackie,'' wasto be serialized beginning today in the weekly Star, a supermarkettabloid.   The Star reports in its April 18 edition that later excerptswill include disclosures about amphetamine use by the Kennedys inthe White House.   Heymann, also author of ``Poor Little Rich Girl: The Life andLegend of Barbara Hutton,'' said that he obtained Secret Service,FBI and CIA files through the Freedom of Information Act and thathe and his researchers conducted 825 interviews. He also had accessto the former first lady's White House social files.   Mrs. Onassis' spokeswoman, Nancy Tuckerman, said Friday thatMrs. Onassis had no comment.   The charges about Kennedy sneaking away from the Secret Servicewere made by Langdon Marvin Jr., a former defense consultant toKennedy.   The book said Marvin and Kennedy sneaked out of the HotelCarlyle in New York to attend a party at a townhouse across thestreet.   ``Within minutes, Jack had made his choice of partner and goneoff with her to her apartment. Moments later, the Secret Servicearrived. Where was the president? Nobody knew. The agent paled.   ``On the street in front of the townhouse stood an Armylieutenant with an attache case handcuffed to his wrist. Jack wasoff making love, and the bagman with the black satchel had beenleft behind.   ``The Russians could have bombed us to hell and back, and therewould have been nothing we could have done about it,'' Marvin wasquoted as saying.   The date of the alleged incident was not given. Marvin died in1987, according to Sandra Bodner, a spokeswoman for the publisher,Lyle Stuart.   ``We are not aware of any material that would support thatallegation,'' said Frank Rigg, a spokesman for the John F. KennedyLibrary in Boston.   Kennedy also had illicit sexual liaisons on the night of hisinauguration and before the Nixon debates, the book said.   Miss Monroe, who has been romantically linked with thepresident, told Kennedy's brother-in-law Peter Lawford that she hadcalled Mrs. Kennedy at the White House, according to the first partof the series.   ``According to Marilyn, Jackie wasn't shaken by the call. Notoutwardly. She agreed to step aside. She would divorce Jack, andMarilyn could marry him, but she would have to move into the WhiteHouse. If Marilyn wasn't prepared to live openly in the WhiteHouse, she might as well forget about it,'' Lawford was quoted assaying.   ``Actually, Jackie was infuriated by the call, and for somereason blamed Frank Sinatra for it. She couldn't easily blame mebecause I was family, so she took it out on him. Sinatra was nolonger welcome at the White House, or in any of the other Kennedybastions,'' said Lawford, who since has died.</TEXT></DOC>
