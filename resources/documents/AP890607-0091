The agency said it is sending technical guides to 39,000 localgovernments, encouraging them to review census maps to make sure allhousing units are included.   More than 100 million census forms will be sent to Americanhouseholds at the end of March 1990 to be used in completing thenational head count April 1.   The bureau said it will hold 470 training sessions for localofficials across the nation.   Then, later this summer, census maps will be sent to the localgovernments for comparison with local tax records, occupancy anddemolition permits, utility hookups and other records to make sureno home has been overlooked.   Once that is completed the Census Bureau will compileblock-by-block housing counts and send them back to local officialsin November for yet another check prior to the actual census.   Census counts are vital to city, state and other localgovernments because those numbers are used to determinerepresentation in Congress and in the distribution of billions ofdollars in state and federal funds to communities.</TEXT></DOC>
