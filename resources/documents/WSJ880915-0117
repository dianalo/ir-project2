But now the softspoken chairman of Kroger Co. is bargaining to keep his company.    Earlier this week, the Haft family received federal clearance to buy an unspecified stake in the Cincinnati-based retailer. Although it's not clear whether the Hafts will mount a takeover attempt, their moves have often sparked bidding wars. So the 62-year-old Mr. Everingham, who began his career at Kroger 42 years ago as a produce clerk, isn't taking any chances.    He's already considering a $3.8 billion restructuring plan that includes a special $40-a-share common stock dividend in an effort to squash any possible hostile bid.    The plan won't necessarily thwart a hostile takeover attempt. Moreover, it isn't without risks. It will saddle the already highly leveraged Kroger with steep debt. Already, two rating agencies, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Service Inc., are reviewing Kroger debt for possible downgrades because of concerns about the substantial funds Kroger must borrow to finance the restructuring.    But Mr. Everingham, a down-to-earth executive who often opts for luncheonettes over fancy restaurants, apparently concluded Kroger had few alternatives. For one thing, the current $745 million long-term debt level prohibits a leveraged buyout, contends Linda Morris, an analyst at Provident National Bank in Philadelphia. (Mr. Everingham declined to be interviewed for this story.)    Moreover, the company's performance in recent years, like that of its large competitors, has been lackluster, with earnings flat. Critics cite a number of strategic mistakes that have proven especially costly at a time when Kroger faces stiffer competition from specialized retailers. Among these: unsuccessful acquisition choices, including a chain of Florida stores that are being dumped just a year after being purchased; poor site selection for stores; and over-reliance on private label goods at a time when consumers prefer brand names in foods.    What's more, an organizational restructuring undertaken two years ago -- when Kroger sold its 890 drugstores and 100 unprofitable food stores and cut corporate staff -- was too little, too late. &quot;It seems (Mr. Everingham) is too conservative, and too slow to take action,&quot; says Gary M. Giblen, an analyst with Rotan-Mosle Inc., Houston. &quot;He's a plain vanilla, white-bread merchant in an age of ethnic and demographic preferences.&quot;    A Kroger spokesman maintains that Mr. Everingham has had the &quot;flexibility&quot; to deal with highly competitive markets. &quot;Anyone who knows the supermarket industry today would have to say we have the most modern and best asset base of stores,&quot; he said.    Mr. Everingham, who was named chief executive in 1978 and chairman a year later, is credited with broadening Kroger's appeal to working women, men and other special-interest groups, in addition to the prototypical housewife, by offering full-service delicatessens, bakeries and even prescription drugs in traditional supermarkets.    Whether the mild-mannered Mr. Everingham, who has had to wrestle for more than year with takeover rumors, can launch an effective counteroffensive should a hostile takeover battle emerge remains to be seen.    One chief executive at a neighboring Cincinnati company describes him as &quot;a very modest man who you can't get words out of easily.&quot; And a Kroger spokesman agrees that &quot;he's not the kind of person who comes into a meeting barking orders -- although when he wants something, he's extremely tenacious.&quot;    Robert M. Raiff, an analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc., New York, says that Mr. Everingham, since learning of the possible move by the Haft family, &quot;hasn't done anything self-oriented or capricious.&quot; Whatever foes Mr. Everingham faces, other industry observers and Kroger employees say, he's likely to respond straightforwardly. </TEXT></DOC>
