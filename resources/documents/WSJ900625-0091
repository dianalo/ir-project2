But this journey will be nohigh-speed, trouble-free dash on the autobahn, they warn.   &quot;There is no precedent for this; it's never been donebefore,&quot; says Kurt Morgen, a Frankfurt-based member of themanaging board of Dresdner Bank AG.</LP><TEXT>   The engine driving the mark's upward mobility, predict thebulls, will be a combination of a booming German economy,higher interest rates, enlarged domestic financial marketsand wider use of the currency in trade and investment,particularly in Eastern Europe.   &quot;The D-mark is going to be the basis for German politicaland economic power in Central and Eastern Europe, andtherefore throughout Europe,&quot; predicts Peter Rona, presidentand chief executive officer of IBJ Schroder Bank andamp; Trust Co.in New York. Among the implications of this are strongerGerman stock and bond markets.   But these forecasts come with timetables that are at leastsix months to a year away.   Meanwhile, monetary and economic union between East andWest Germany is scheduled to take place Sunday. Apprehensionabout its effects has had currency markets on edge sinceearly February. That's when the mark's 20% rise against thedollar and yen -- a climb that began last September andaccelerated after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November --stopped dead in its tracks.   In late New York trading Friday, the dollar stood at1.6745 marks and 154.85 yen, compared with 1.6778 marks and154.80 yen late Thursday. Meanwhile, the British pound roseto $1.7330 from $1.7200.   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at155.10 yen; it closed Friday in Tokyo at 154.75 yen.Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6743marks, down from Friday's Tokyo close of 1.6796 marks.   Since early February, the mark has mostly traded in anarrow band of 1.65-1.71 to the dollar. Slowing its advancewere worries over the inflationary impact of the plannedcurrency union and the huge outlays needed for overhaulingthe East German economy.   The mark also has been weakened by concern about growingturmoil in the Soviet Union, and it is especially vulnerableto political instability in Eastern Europe because ofGermany's geographic proximity and trade links to the region.   Few traders or economists expect these negative factors todisappear anytime soon. The West German budget deficit willbe about 50 billion marks ($29.8 million) this year and riseto 100 billion marks in 1991, predicts David D. Hale, chiefeconomist at Kemper Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.   &quot;The Bundesbank will have to increase its money supply tomake credit available for growth in East Germany and make itpossible for corporations to raise funds they want to investin Eastern Europe,&quot; says Thomas Barman, head of treasuryoperations for Credit Suisse in New York.   At the same time, &quot;it's very clear there will bePan-German elections in December or January. Meanwhile,unemployment in East Germany will rise toward two million,which will lead to more pressure for government spending,which raises inflation,&quot; warns Mr. Hale. What's more, headds: &quot;There's the unknown cost of Germany having to supportthe Soviet Union.&quot; Last week, Bonn said it will guarantee afive billion mark bank loan to Moscow.   This spending spree puts the Bundesbank in a bind. If ittightens monetary policy too quickly, &quot;it could stranglegrowth,&quot; warns Eric Taze-Bernard, senior economist at BanqueIndosuez in Paris. Yet if its policies are too lax, Germanyrisks accelerating inflation and a weakening mark.   &quot;The big short-term, six-month question is theindependence of the Bundesbank,&quot; says Mr. Hale. &quot;Can{Bundesbank President Karl Otto} Poehl be allowed to do what{Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul} Volcker did in1981-1982?&quot; -- temper faster growth and inflation with atighter monetary policy.   In the long run, Mr. Hale and others are betting he will.And as a consequence, many of the short-term mark bearsremain long-term bulls.   Economists at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. see the combination of arelaxed fiscal and tight monetary policies propelling themark to new highs, just as a similar U.S. policy mix sent thedollar soaring in the early 1980s. Michael Andrews, a Merrilleconomist, predicts the mark will eventually rise toward 1.50marks to the dollar, surpassing its record of 1.56.   &quot;The {mark} will strengthen, because it will attractcapital,&quot; says Mr. Barman of Credit Suisse. &quot;The German stockmarket is going to look very, very attractive in years tocome.&quot;   Mr. Rona of IBJ-Schroder envisions the evolution of a hugetrading bloc in Eastern Europe that uses the mark as itspayments currency. Neither the Soviet Union nor any of itssix former East bloc satellites -- Poland, East Germany,Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania or Bulgaria -- haveconvertible currencies. Up to now, trade within the group --the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, or Comecon -- hasbeen paid for in so-called &quot;convertible rubles,&quot; a hybridthat is essentially a system of credits and debits.   But as of Jan. 1, 1991, trade between the seven will beconducted in hard currencies. Besides East Germany, Mr. Ronabelieves other East bloc nations will adopt the mark fortrade transactions. &quot;Poland, Romania, Hungary andCzechoslovakia will be filing up to join,&quot; he argues.&quot;Imports, exports, investment decisions and returns will allbe calculated in D-marks.&quot; Even domestic prices and wageswill be figured in marks, he predicts.   Germany &quot;can create a Deutsche mark zone throughoutEurope,&quot; asserts Mr. Rona. Already, the Dutch, Swiss andAustrian currencies are closely tied to the mark, and thecurrency has long been the linchpin of the European MonetarySystem's exchange rate mechanism, a joint float of nineEuropean currencies.   &quot;Given the economic links in the region, the mark couldemerge as a more important global currency,&quot; says Kemper'sMr. Hale.   The mark's status could be further cemented by the pivotalrole German companies and banks are expected to play inEastern Europe's development. Already, &quot;Germany is thebiggest supplier of credit to Eastern Europe and its biggestwestern trading partner,&quot; adds Michael Rosenberg, a vicepresident at Merrill Lynch.   George Noble, a portfolio manager at Fidelity Managementand Research Co. in Boston, says that one top Italianexecutive called Eastern Europe &quot;a private German huntingpreserve.&quot;   Analysts also predict that the large costs of fundingGerman reunification will lead to a rapid growth in theGerman bond, stock, short-term money and futures markets.&quot;That,&quot; says Mr. Hale, &quot;will encourage increased use of themark.&quot;   Not everyone, however, buys the supermark argument. DavidM. Mars, European economist for S.G. Warburg Securities Ltd.in London, predicts the Bundesbank won't be able to check theinflationary pressures that unification unleashes. He arguesthat despite the central bank's solid reputation as aninflation fighter, it has oversold its ability to control theGerman money supply and remain independent of politics.   Mr. Mars says that at some point, five new members of thecentral bank's governing council will come from East Germanyand &quot;they will constantly fight for easier credit policies.&quot;He adds: &quot;Poehl and the rest of the council aren't going toraise interest rates to fight inflation, and the mark willweaken.&quot;   Mr. Mars also questions East Germans' work ethic aftermore than four decades of life under communist rule. Withinsix months, he says, &quot;people will start to look for analternative to the mark.&quot; He predicts it will be the Frenchfranc. Backed by a big economy and a government committed tolow inflation, &quot;France will look like a zone of stability,&quot;he says.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold forcurrent delivery settled at $350.40 an ounce, down 30 cents.Estimated volume was a moderate 2.5 million ounces.   In Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at $350.35 an ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
