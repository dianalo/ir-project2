But the outcome is far from certain.    Taiwan, whose people have been ruled by the Kuomintang government that fled from the Chinese mainland in 1949, moved from an underdeveloped backwater to a newly industrialized economy swimming in cash by selling inexpensive goods to the world, mostly to the U.S. The authoritarian government, trying to show that capitalism provided more growth than the communist system on the mainland, promoted Taiwan's single-minded export drive.    Now, that path has reached a blind alley. The U.S., which since late 1978 has recognized Beijing, not Taipei, as the legitimate Chinese government, is now raising the specter of protectionism against Taiwan and other major exporters, while other Southeast Asian countries are chasing Taiwan with lower-priced goods. And China has all but abandoned its inefficient egalitarianism to pursue a more profit-oriented economic course.    Those economic forces, coupled with the death of President Chiang Ching-kuo in January, are pushing Taiwan to follow a new road -- toward economic and political liberalization.    President Chiang, in the year before he died, lifted martial law, loosened foreign-exchange controls, slashed tariffs on imports and opened the door for visits to relatives in mainland China. Opposition parties still aren't legal, but they are tolerated. And the press is freer.    Still, influential Taiwanese say the changes aren't enough and that Taiwan must open its markets, encourage domestic consumption and give its people even more political freedom.    That's a tall order for Lee Teng-hui, the first native Taiwanese president and newly elected chairman of the ruling Kuomintang, or KMT. President Lee says he will forge ahead with the late President Chiang's reforms. But Mr. Lee isn't the strongman that his predecessor was, and his initiatives may meet resistance.    &quot;The general thrust of the reforms will continue, but the pace will be slower,&quot; says Lu Ya-li, a political science professor at National Taiwan University.    Despite his success in promoting like-minded younger reformists to the KMT Central Committee at the party congress last month, Mr. Lee still must walk a political tightrope. He must take care not to offend the conservative old KMT clique while still meeting popular demands for change.    &quot;They (KMT leaders) want reform, but they are also afraid of reform. They want to meet the expectations of the people but they are afraid of upsetting vested interests,&quot; says reform-minded KMT legislator Jaw Shau-kong.    But inevitably, reforms will mean wrenching change. Economists say the small family businesses that dominate Taiwan's economy must make more value-added products -- fewer toys and more computers. At the same time, the government must balance industry's demands for infrastructure projects, such as power plants, with the demands by a growing middle class for cleaner air and a better quality of life.    But critics say the 12-chapter platform hammered out at the party congress last month was heavy on propaganda and skimpy on specifics. &quot;They don't have an action plan,&quot; says Mr. Jaw. While the politicans are bogged down in their attempt to please all parties, the Taiwanese people are raring to go. In super-congested downtown Taipei, modern office towers are quickly replacing make-shift family factories, a sign of confidence that the economic boom will last.    Optimism also pervades the markets and flashy department stores. With per-capita income last year of almost $5,100, among the highest in the developing world, Taiwan's residents are eager to enjoy their new wealth. In Taipei's bustling Rebar department store, for example, the aisles are overflowing with American appliances, Japanese consumer electronics and European household goods. Standing near a demonstration of a European ice-cream maker, Soong Chang Yuen-chun, a 51-year-old Taipei housewife says, &quot;Eating ice cream is still a luxury in Taiwan. I want to make it at home.&quot;    Like many consumers, Mrs. Soong and her retired husband own a television, refrigerator, washing machine and other major appliances. They even had enough left over to travel abroad twice this year.    Not everyone likes the changes. Many older, established companies were shocked when railway workers staged Taiwan's first major national strike in May. W.S. Lin, president of Tatung Co., the largest domestic manufacturer of consumer electronics, worries that an ignited labor movement will thwart Taiwan's economic progress. &quot;We don't want to catch the British disease,&quot; he warns.    The government appears to share some of Mr. Lin's concern but so far has responded by pledging to investigate disputes and step up enforcement of existing labor laws. But foreign observers don't see the infant labor and environmental movements as a serious threat to the economy. Economists predict real growth in gross national product will be about 8.5% this year (GNP measures the total value of all goods and services produced).    While domestic pressures have forced most of the political changes, foreign pressure, mostly from the U.S., Taiwan's No. 1 trading partner, has been a key catalyst for economic reform.    For years, the U.S. took in about 50% of Taiwan's total exports. But as the trade imbalance swelled in Taipei's favor, the U.S. started pressuring Taiwan to cut tariffs on imports, stimulate domestic demand and liberalize the financial system. The U.S. even dropped Taiwan from its list of countries with special tariff-free trading privileges.    In response, Taiwan is moving to correct its heavy dependence on exports and its huge trade surplus ($19 billion in 1987) with the U.S. Taiwan's central bank has allowed the New Taiwan dollar to rise about 40% since September 1985. Many Taiwan exporters hit by the strong currency have moved production elsewhere in Asia -- even discreetly to China. And the government is encouraging exporters to look to new markets: Europe, Japan, Southeast Asia and the Eastern bloc.    These efforts are beginning to pay off. Some economists predict Taiwan's 1988 trade surplus with the U.S. may dip to between $10 billion and $12 billion.    But the U.S., noting that Taiwan has more than $70 billion in reserves, wants Taiwan to further reduce import quotas and tariffs on farm products.    One area that analysts see more hope for agreement is liberalization of Taiwan's underdeveloped financial system to create new ways of raising capital and freeing the flow of funds. State-owned banks are so flooded with cash that they pay lower interest rates to customers with big deposits. Lingering memories of investors holding worthless mainland government bonds in the 1940s have stunted the growth of government and corporate bond markets. And disclosure rules discouraging family-owned businesses from taking their shares public have created a severe shortage of new listings on Taiwan's stock exchange.    The U.S wants greater access for American firms in the banking, insurance and securities industries, arguing that their presence will help modernize the system. Mr. Lee has placed bank reform high on his agenda, but the entrenched bureaucracy is reluctant to give up control.    The government is also stimulating domestic demand. It is issuing an additional 100 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$3.5 billion) in government bonds this year to improve roads, mass transit, health care and other public works that lag far behind the nation's wealth. &quot;We should have started this 10 years ago,&quot; says Su Hang-ming, chief economist at the International Commercial Bank of China.    The government has been slow to develop the domestic infrastructure, in part because the military swallows about 50% of the national budget. But some analysts cite another reason: The ruling KMT feared that people might get too comfortable and lose their will to recapture the mainland. But now, with a native Taiwanese president and a younger generation psychologically detached from the mainland, the emphasis is on making Taiwan a better place to live.    ---                            Taiwan                   1987 Economic Signposts              Population        19.7 million              Exports           $57.80 billion              Imports           $41.00 billion              Norminal GDP      $94.75 billion              External Debt     $22.80 billion              Interest Payment              as % of Exports    1.8%   Source: Institute of International Finance, Washington</TEXT></DOC>
