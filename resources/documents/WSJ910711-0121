Butthey are right for the wrong reasons. Conservatives see Mr.Thomas as an advocate of judicial restraint and thejurisprudence of Original Intent. Mr. Thomas is not, however,cast in the Bork mold, and it would not be good news if hewere. The real reason to celebrate the Thomas nomination isthe seed of judicial activism in his writings -- morallyprincipled activism on behalf of economic and other personalrights.   In four published writings, penned near the close of histenure as chairman of the U.S. Equal Employment OpportunityCommission, Mr. Thomas distanced himself from the Reaganadministration's cramped reading of constitutional rights.These articles appeared in 1987 issues of the Howard LawJournal and of the Yale Law and Policy Review, in a 1988 bookpublished by the Cato Institute, &quot;Assessing the ReaganYears,&quot; and in a 1989 issue of the Harvard Journal of Law andPublic Policy. Each of the articles is concerned with anaspect of civil rights, but all explore broader questions ofconstitutional interpretation. The articles fit snugly withwhat is known of Mr. Thomas's Catholic background, defend hisactual performance at the EEOC and offer some tantalizingclues about what kind of justice he might be.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Thomas's writings are a catalog of Originalistanathemas. He repeatedly invokes &quot;higher law,&quot; and deniesthat constitutional rights exist only because of somepolitical act. He calls for a jurisprudence based on broadmoral principles of freedom and equality. Far from beingtransfixed by the specter of judicial activism, heunderstands the pre-eminent democratic dangers of tyrannicalmajorities and elected officials run amok. He speakseloquently of the need to recognize the place of economicliberties in the Constitution's scheme of values.   The Thomas constitutional vision is first and foremostLincolnian: The Constitution should be read, as Lincoln readit, in light of the moral aspirations toward liberty andequality announced in the Declaration of Independence. Theseprinciples specify goals to strive for, and so their meaningcannot be exhausted by the specific understandings orpractices of the founding generation.   Again like Lincoln, Mr. Thomas also insists thatconstitutional principles are politically educative. Lincolnstrove to hold the wrongness of slavery before the publicmind in order to keep that horrid practice on the path ofultimate extinction. For similar reasons, Mr. Thomas insistson getting the principle of equality right. The correctprinciple, as he sees it, is equal opportunity forindividuals, not special entitlements for groups. Mr. Thomascondemns racial set-asides and other group preferencepolicies on the ground that these teach dependence ongovernment largesse and undermine individual self-reliance.   Mr. Thomas's opponents will undoubtedly point to hisfrequent invocations of &quot;higher law&quot; or &quot;natural law.&quot; Mr.Thomas calls these &quot;the best defense of liberty and limitedgovernment. . . . {and} of judicial review.&quot; Is &quot;higher law&quot;a stand-in for religion or merely personal opinions aboutmorality? Does &quot;natural law&quot; mean a return to untrammeledlaissez-faire?   There's nothing spooky about &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; law. Itstands for the idea that some things are wrong, not simply asa matter of social convention or political fiat, but on moregeneral or abstract grounds. So even where slavery, forexample, is legally protected and accepted by localconventions, it is still an unjust infringement on humandignity and equality. Nearly everyone would accept that. Mostof us believe in something like &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;higher&quot;morality. The question is whether moral judgments have anyrole to play when judges interpret the Constitution. JudgeThomas appears to think so, and for good reason.   Many parts of the Constitution can be interpreted withoutreference to morality -- that a president must be 35 yearsold, for example. But in some places the Constitution itselfuses moral terms: The Preamble speaks of &quot;establishingjustice,&quot; the Eighth Amendment bans &quot;excessive&quot; bail and&quot;cruel&quot; punishments, the Ninth speaks of unenumerated&quot;rights&quot; &quot;retained by the people.&quot; And as Mr. Thomas remindsus, the Constitution presupposes and refers back to thenatural-rights language of the Declaration of Independence.The Constitution itself makes morality relevant.   Morality always plays a role in constitutionalinterpretation, whether or not that role is acknowledged.Pro-government conservatives rely on a morality of majoritypower, which requires a narrow reading of individual rights.Liberal activists deploy a morality at odds with theConstitution's explicit and repeated protections for propertyrights and economic liberty. Judge Thomas's admittedlysketchy writings are compatible with a broad understanding ofrights, an understanding well-grounded in constitutional textand tradition.   There are many sources of constitutional meaning: the textand structure of the document, the tradition of itsinterpretation. No theory -- including one that invokeshigher moral principles -- provides all the answers. Morallyprincipled activists argue only that moral judgment has arole to play.   If Mr. Thomas means it when he says that &quot;freedom is themain source of all that is good politically,&quot; then he shouldbe prepared to recognize a right to privacy. Privacy is notexplicitly mentioned in the Constitution, but iswell-supported by principles clearly present in the foundingdocument. And if he means it when he says that economicliberties are &quot;a vital part of the rights protected byconstitutional government,&quot; then he can press for meaningfulreview of laws infringing on economic liberties. The point isnot to charge back to wild-eyed activism, left or right. Thepoint is to acknowledge that an active and principled SupremeCourt is a necessary counterbalance to the ever more powerfulmajoritarian branches of government.   The Thomas nomination provides conservatives with a timelyopportunity to reassess their attitude toward the SupremeCourt. It's time to stop fighting the last war: Warren Courtactivism. It's time to embrace the unique contribution thatthe court can make to the core values of the Americanpolitical tradition: individual freedom, equal opportunityand limited government.   The promise of Clarence Thomas is that of a principledjudicial activism that honors the whole range ofconstitutional values. This promise cannot be realized unlessconservatives get over their worn-out fetishes of judicialdeference and majoritarianism. The court remains what theFounders hoped it would be: one great bulwark of limitedgovernment and individual freedom. The conservative voiceshould help define and defend those freedoms.   ---   Mr. Macedo, an associate professor of government atHarvard, is the author of &quot;Liberal Virtues&quot; (Oxford, 1990).</TEXT></DOC>
