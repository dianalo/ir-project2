The container has been outfitted with instruments for measurementsof different environmentally relevant trace gases. The instruments areoperated during the flight by two members of the Institute. Flight missionswere mainly performed between Frankfurt, FRG, and Sao Paulo, Brazil.Latitudinal distributions have been determined for the trace gases CH/sub4/, H/sub 2/O, O/sub 3/, CO, NO, NO/sub y/, CO/sub 2/, N/sub 2/O, CF/sub2/Cl/sub 2/, CFCl/sub 3/, C/sub 2/F/sub 3/Cl/sub 3/, CHCl/sub 3/, CH/sub3/CCl/sub 3/, CCl/sub 4/, C/sub 2/H/sub 2/, C/sub 2/H/sub 2/, C/sub 2/H/sub6/,C/sub 3/H/sub 6/, C/sub 3/H/sub 8/, C/sub 4/H/sub 10/, C/sub 5/H/sub12/, C/sub 6/H/sub 6/, and C/sub 7/H/sub 8/. The data are presented anddiscussed in this report. The results obtained between 1982 and 1987show an increase of the upper tropospheric concentrations of severaltrace gases. The average annual increase is found to be 0.76% for CH/sub4/, 0.16% for N/sub 2/O, 4.4% for CF/sub 2/Cl/sub 2/, 5.3% for CFCl/sub3/, 17.2% for C/sub 2/F/sub 3/Cl/sub 3/, 4.5% for CH/sub 3/CCl/sub 3/and 2.1% for CCl/sub 4/.
