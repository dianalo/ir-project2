Under a settlement worked out over the past 10 days and announcedin U.S. District Court, the Commerce Department and the CensusBureau agreed to create an eight-person panel to review censusmethods and advise the secretary of commerce whether blacks andother minorities are accurately counted.   The agreement was reached in a lawsuit brought last November byNew York City and joined by two states and several cities with largeminority populations.   It has potentially far-reaching implications, and could influencehow federal money is distributed, as well as the boundaries ofcongressional districts which are determined by population.   ``This is a civil-rights issue, not a money issue,'' said cityCorporation Counsel Peter L. Zimroth. ``The money is secondary, whatwe want is the most accurate count. There are people in this countrywho are not brought into account. They are losing representation.''   Under the arrangement accepted by U.S. District Judge Joseph M.McLaughlin, the panel of statisticians and demographers will examinethe results of the 1990 census and recommend to the commercesecretary whether the numbers need to be adjusted.   Following the nationwide head count, the Census Bureau willconduct a massive follow-up survey sampling 150,000 householdsnationwide to determine whether the final tally should be adjusted.   In a suit joined by New York state, California, Los Angeles,Chicago, Houston, Dade County, Fla., and several civil-rightsorganizations, New York City charged that the counting methods ofthe Census Bureau commonly undercounts blacks, Hispanics, thehomeless and illegal aliens.   Zimroth said the agreement potentially means ``many millions ofdollars'' for the city in federal funds lost because of theundercounting.   According to the city, the 1980 census missed as many as 500,000people, or 6 percent of the city's population. The city estimates ithas lost as much as $52 million annually in federal funds beginningin 1980.   Stephen Hart, a Justice Department lawyer, said the 1990 census``is going to be taken in the normal fashion'' and the commercesecretary will then hear the advisory panel's recommendations anddecide by July 15, 1991, if adjustment is needed.   While 99 percent of everyone living in the country is counted, asmany as 7 percent of the nation's blacks are overlooked, said Hart.The Census Bureau was looking at methods to reduce the undercount,caused by people not responding to questionnaires or not cooperatingwith neighborhood canvassers.   ``The problem is that the initial census is very flawed,''Zimroth said.   Speaking at a City Hall news conference, Mayor Edward I. Kochsaid the agreement was ``a great victory'' for the city and added``the impact is money.''   Monday's agreement removed a motion by the city for a preliminaryinjunction that could have stopped the 1990 census. However, amotion for a permanent injunction that could prevent the CensusBureau from using the 1990 count should the federal government notabide to the terms of the agreement remained in place.   The agreement essentially reverses a position taken earlier bythe Commerce Department, parent agency of the Census Bureau.   Census officials, aware of criticism that they missed 1 percentto 2 percent of Americans in 1980, and as many as 5 percent ofminorities, had been studying methods of making an adjustment in1990, including a post-census survey to be used to evaluate thecount itself.   The Commerce Department, however, announced last fall that noadjustment would be made in 1990. That agency cited concerns that nosurvey could be as accurate as the actual head count and said thatit was worried that adjusting the figures would lead to even morelawsuits and jeopardize public confidence in the results of thecount.   At that time Barbara Bailer, who had been in charge of the Censusprogram studying the undercount, resigned in protest of thedecision. Bailer, who now heads the American StatisticalAssociation, could not be reached for comment on the new agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
