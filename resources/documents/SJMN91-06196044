Theyusually only get cursory mention in the final declaration.&quot;;    For instance,a German decision to lower interest rates would stimulate employmentthroughout Europe. A decision not to will have the reverse effect.;    Thesummit is expected to endorse a debt-reduction plan for the poorest countriesof Africa. It is the only Third World issue on the agenda.;    The Group ofSeven members are the creditor nations. They determine how and where capitalflows. As a bloc, they produce more, buy more and sell more than the rest ofthe world combined.;    The influence of this group is greater today than ithas ever been, tremendously enhanced by the collapse of the economies of thesocialist countries over the last two years.;    Before that occurred, therewere two strategies for development in the world, two paths into the future:the socialist command economy (central planning and price controls) and thefree-market system.;    Most of the Third World nations came into being in thelate 1950s and early 1960s on the ruins of the retreating European empires asthe East-West confrontation crystallized. They linked their destinies to onesystem or the other.;    Now the socialist side has collapsed. That path lednowhere. A few holdouts struggle on, trying to live by socialist strategies:China, North Korea, Cuba. Their progress is minimal, their political systemssqualid and corrupt.;    Hurtado said she believes the breakup of thesocialist world has not helped the poorer nations. Rather, it has sharpenedthe division between North and South, rich and poor, leaving the Third Worldincreasingly isolated.;    No one responsible has suggested the Group of Sevenis ignoring the needs of the Third World out of malice. One economist said,however, that the removal of the competition between East and West forallegiance of Third World countries has not helped them.;    &quot;There is noreason for (the West) to pay attention now. If you have strength, or leverage,you can get attention. No strength, no attention. It makes people cynical,&quot;the economist said.;    One Canadian development worker, who declined to allowhis name to be used, complained that the richer countries in the Group ofSeven rarely address the fundamental problems of development or work to createbetter terms of trade.;    &quot;We tend to hunker down behind our nationalboundaries, put up strong barriers to immigration and refugees, give verysmall amounts of foreign assistance, then point our fingers at the non-whiteworld and say, 'If you were as smart as us, you'd be developed, too.' &quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RICHARD O'MARA, Baltimore Sun  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  London  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910714  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  580  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday July 14, 199100196044,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
