EdwardKennedy, D-Mass., told a reporter this week. The rights bill is snarled in apolitical impasse between the Republican White House and theDemocrat-controlled Congress.;    Kennedy, the chairman of the SenateEducation and Labor Committee, has offered several bills that he said aremeant to &quot;plug the gaps&quot; in education legislation offered by the president.Some of Kennedy's proposals are likely to be stitched into a compromise billthat education lobbyists say has a good chance for enactment.;    In effect,Kennedy's committee will put the education debate on fast and slow tracks. Onthe fast track will be Bush's less-divisive proposals, along with some ofKennedy's.;    Top-priority proposals;  (check) Help teachers upgrade theirknowledge and qualifications.;    (check) Reward schools that do a good job ofmeeting the national goals set forth last year by Bush and state governors.Those include helping preschoolers prepare adequately for entering firstgrade; increasing high school graduation rates; improving math and scienceperformance; achieving universal literacy; and making schools safe anddrug-free.;    (check) Encourage alternative teaching methods that embrace newtechnologies for self-instruction and hands-on learning.;    Bush also wantsto transform much of the $6 billion program for low-income pupils, known asChapter 1, from a direct-grant to a tuition-voucher system. This would letparents send their children to whatever school, public or private, they couldafford with the vouchers. That money goes now to public schools that enrollsuch youngsters.;    Bush for choosing schools;  The president also would givestate and local governments money to encourage them to devise school-choiceprograms, allowing pupils to switch to better schools -- public or private.;   The cost differential between the White House and the Senate Democrats'bills, however, could pose a serious problem. Bush's plan would cost $690million; Kennedy's, $3.2 billion -- although that includes $1 billion forextending the preschool Head Start program, a proposal the administrationopposes.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID HESS, Mercury News Washington Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910525  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  425  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday May 25, 199100146029,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
