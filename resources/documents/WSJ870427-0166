We support a continuing evolutionary process toward a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue.&quot;    He went on to note that &quot;the pace, however, will be determined by the Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait, free of outside pressure.&quot; Then, in a statement that raised eyebrows among China watchers world-wide, the secretary said: &quot;We have welcomed developments, including indirect trade and increasing human interchange, which have contributed to a relaxation of tensions in the Taiwan Strait. Our steadfast policy seeks to foster an environment within which such developments can continue to take place.&quot;    I was in Taipei at the time of Mr. Shultz's remarks, then traveled to Beijing before returning to Washington late last month. In each country, different interpretations were made of Mr. Shultz's rephrasing of U.S. reunification policy. In the past, that policy had stressed three points: Chinese on both sides should resolve the issue themselves; the U.S. would not become involved; and the sole U.S. interest is that the issue be settled peacefully.    The U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Gaston Sigur, reiterated traditional American policy last December in a speech before the World Affairs Council in San Francisco:    &quot;Some have urged the U.S. government to become involved in efforts to promote peaceful resolution of the differences between Beijing and Taipei. However, there is a real danger that American involvement would be counterproductive. For at least two decades, we have viewed this issue as an internal matter for the PRC {Peoples' Republic of China} and Taiwan to resolve themselves. We will not serve as an intermediary or pressure Taiwan on the matter. We leave it up to both sides to settle their differences; our predominant interest is that the settlement be a peaceful one.&quot;    The critical difference between statements made by Mr. Shultz and previous policy is that the secretary's remarks implied U.S. approval of increased contact between Beijing and Taipei. Earlier policy had stressed that the U.S. would not become involved other than to insist that any settlement be peaceful.    The difference may be subtle but it is highly significant in the context of the U.S.-Taiwan-China triangle, as shown by the various interpretations of the Shultz remarks I encountered during my trip. In Taipei, there was genuine concern that America had moved incrementally toward encouraging Taiwan to reunify with the communist mainland. By publicly approving &quot;indirect trade and increasing human interchange,&quot; the American secretary of state was thought to be signaling Taipei that it should change its official policy of &quot;no negotiations, no compromise, and no contact&quot; with China.    Such an interpretation is possible because of Taiwan's heavy dependence on the U.S. for trade, arms and political support. Taipei considers reunification a &quot;life-and-death&quot; issue and suspects that Washington's deviations from previous statements are attempts to resolve the &quot;Taiwan issue&quot; to clear the decks for improved U.S.-China relations.    By contrast, scholars and officials in both Beijing and Shanghai reacted to Mr. Shultz's remarks with muted elation. They saw in his approval of &quot;indirect trade and increasing human interchange&quot; a nod in the direction of Beijing's repeated request for the Reagan administration &quot;to do something&quot; to help bring about peaceful reunification. Since the December 1984 signing of the Sino-British accord on the future of Hong Kong, Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese officials had badgered the president and the State Department to use their influence to persuade Taipei to accept the &quot;three exchanges&quot; with the mainland -- trade, visits and mail.    In an interview with CBS-TV in September, Mr. Deng told his American audience that he hoped President Reagan would make &quot;some effort {regarding} China's reunification. I believe the United States, President Reagan in particular, can accomplish something with regard to this question.&quot; Conversations in China last month clearly convinced me that many mainland Chinese viewed Mr. Shultz's rephrasing of U.S. policy as a positive response to Mr. Deng's request.    In Washington, I heard a third interpretation. In both private and public meetings, State Department officials in charge of U.S.-China policy said Mr. Shultz was merely repeating current U.S. policy but in a different way. References to &quot;indirect trade and increasing human interchange&quot; were observations of fact, not statements of policy, they said. They emphasized that America, at least under President Reagan, would not pressure Taipei into a settlement with the mainland.    But the strong reactions in Taipei and Beijing suggest creative rhetoric may not be what is needed. As a U.S.-born Chinese told me, &quot;Any Chinese would see Shultz's statement as a move toward the mainland's position.&quot; If, as the State Department assures us, Mr. Shultz's words do not signify a change in policy, then perhaps the words should not change either.    ---   Mr. Lasater directs the Asian Studies Center at the Heritage Foundation. </TEXT></DOC>
