In this paper, specific technicalcase studies are addressed in the fields of greenhouse agriculture andheating systems in the domestic, commercial and industrial sectors. Businessopportunities are examined in each of these sectors through the utilizationof appropriate technology and conservation techniques. The examples givenare to illustrate current practices and to outline short-term and projectedlong-term opportunities. In the field of greenhouse agriculture, considerationis given to this technology as an alternative source of food production,with technical discussion examining problems relating to the Canadianenvironment. Potential economic benefits, including increased employmentopportunities, are identified. A unique contribution to this discussionis the proposal for using currently-unused building roofs as greenhousesites. This paper also covers waste-heat utilization, the adaptationof new energy sources (especially solar), and the assessment of the propertechnology potential in this field. 12 figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
