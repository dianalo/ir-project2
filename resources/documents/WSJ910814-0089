In the past 30 years, our legalsystem has become burdened with excessive costs and longdelays. Overuse and abuse of the legal system imposetremendous costs upon American society: an estimated $300billion a year.   To address these problems, the President's Council onCompetitiveness, which I chair, established a working groupon Federal Civil Justice Reform in January 1991. The workinggroup, led by Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr, was askedto recommend reforms to the federal civil justice process inorder to decrease the costs and time required to resolvelegal disputes. The following is excerpted from the Council'sFinal Report, released yesterday, and entitled &quot;Agenda forCivil Justice Reform in America.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   -- Dan Quayle                                                                                                          In 1989, nearly 18 million new civil cases were filed inthe state and federal courts. This amounts to one lawsuit forevery 10 adults. In the federal courts alone, the number oflawsuits filed each year has almost tripled in the past 30years -- from approximately 90,000 in 1960 to more than250,000 in 1990.   This dramatic growth in litigation carries with it veryhigh costs for the U.S. economy. A recent survey by theConference Board, a group of 3,600 organizations in more than50 nations, reports that for fear of civil liability:   -- 47% of U.S. manufacturers have withdrawn products fromthe market;   -- 25% of U.S. manufacturers have discontinued some formsof product research.   -- Approximately 15% of U.S. companies have laid offworkers as a direct result of product liability experience.   According to a 1984 study commissioned by the U.S.Department of Commerce, foreign competitors often haveproduct liability insurance costs that are 20 to 50 timeslower than U.S. companies. In a survey of more than 250American companies, more than three-quarters of theexecutives said they believe that the U.S. will bedisadvantaged in world markets unless modifications are madein the liability system.   The current common law approach to punitive damagesfrequently distributes awards in a random and capriciousmanner. In the past, punitive damages were assessed only incases where the defendant was proved to have had aquasi-criminal intent to harm the plaintiff. Today, however,plaintiffs in civil lawsuits routinely ask juries to awardnot only compensatory damages, for their economic, orout-of-pocket losses, but also punitive damages. A 1987 studyby the Institute for Civil Justice, which examined 24,000jury trials in Cook County, Ill., found that the averagepunitive damage award increased, in inflation-adjusteddollars, from $43,000 in 1965-69 to $729,000 in 1980-84 -- ajump of 1,500%. In personal injury cases, the rise has beeneven more dramatic.   The Council recommends that punitive damages be awarded ina rational and consistent manner. Plaintiffs seeking punitivedamages should not be allowed to assign a specific dollaramount to their requests. Where there is evidence ofoutrageous misconduct or where there is clear and convincingevidence of the defendant's intent to cause injury, thenpunitive damages may be awarded in a separate proceeding. Inany event, however, the amount of punitive damages should notexceed the plaintiff's actual damages.   The Council also recommends a test of a modified two-wayfee-shifting arrangement, whereby the loser of a lawsuit paysthe costs incurred by the winner. Although limitations wouldbe built into this system to safeguard equal access to thecourts, this reform would encourage pretrial settlements andimpose market discipline on the litigation process.   The &quot;loser pays&quot; rule (sometimes called the English Rule)is grounded in fairness -- in the equitable principle that aparty who suffers should be made whole. Because the losingparty will be obligated to pay the winner's fees, thisapproach will encourage litigants to evaluate carefully themerits of their cases before initiating a frivolous claim oradopting a spurious defense.   The Council further proposes a moratorium on the more than150 one-way fee shifting statutes under which victoriousplaintiffs recover their fees from losing defendants, whilevictorious defendants get no such recovery.   Pretrial discovery is frequently the source of needlessdelay and expense. Litigants have virtually unlimited abilityto take sworn depositions of witnesses, request documents andsubmit written questions to witnesses. More than 80% of thetime and cost of a typical lawsuit involve pretrialexamination of facts through discovery. A 1980 survey foundthat 92% of all attorneys use discovery tactics as aneconomic weapon against their opponents.   The Council recommends several fundamental reforms to thediscovery process, including disclosure of basic informationand an initial round of discovery that would continue to be&quot;free&quot; to the requesting party. Beyond this initial round,however, the requesting party would have to pay foradditional discovery.   Mandatory early disclosure of core information recognizesthat in the vast majority of cases there are basic facts thatshould be exchanged by the parties in order to reach asatisfactory resolution and that this exchange should beaccomplished without gamesmanship or expense. This earlyexchange would increase the opportunity for effectivediscovery planning and early settlement discussions.   Reform of expert witness practice is also essential iftrials are to remain fair and rational mechanisms forconflict resolution. &quot;Expert&quot; witnesses regularly offer their&quot;scientific&quot; opinions on the connections between automobileaccidents and breast cancer or environmental pollutants and&quot;chemically induced AIDS.&quot; As if the ability to fashionalmost any opinion into expert testimony were not enough,there is considerable use of contingency fees to pay expertwitnesses.   One of the Council's principal recommendations in thisregard is to require expert testimony to be based on &quot;widelyaccepted&quot; theories. This would eliminate testimonyunsupported by professional practice or scientific knowledge.   The Council also recommends banning contingency fees forexpert witnesses. This should prevent expert witnesses frombecoming mercenaries or advocates, instead of impartial andobjective witnesses.   In addition to these reforms, the Council'srecommendations include:   -- Promote voluntary use of Alternative Dispute Resolution(ADR) Techniques: Create a &quot;multi-door courthouse&quot; to permitparties to choose between different methods for resolvingtheir dispute.   -- Early trial dates: Judges should establish an earlytrial date immediately after the pleadings are completed.Once established, the trial date should be delayed only forcompelling reason, or the needs of the court.   -- Require notice prior to filing a lawsuit: In mostcases, the right to sue should be conditioned on a showingthat the parties have attempted, but failed, to resolve theirdispute.   -- Penalize abusive discovery: Amend the Federal Rules ofCivil Procedure to establish clear standards for imposingsanctions upon attorneys who abuse the system. The partywhose conduct necessitated the discovery motion would bearthe burden of establishing that its position wassubstantially justified.   -- Strengthen sanctions against false court filings: Thepresent attorney sanctions provision, Federal Rule 11, shouldbe retained. Courts should have the power to penalize thoseresponsible for making unfounded assertions in filings, notmerely the attorney who signs the document.   -- Reduce poor draftsmanship in legislation andregulations: All proposed laws and regulation should undergoa &quot;litigation hazards&quot; review to insure that poor drafting oflegislation and regulation does not create unnecessarylitigation.   The administration will draft legislation to implementthese recommendations and will work with Congress towardreform. Other changes will require amendment to the FederalRules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence andthe Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. The administrationwill draft proposed rules changes and submit the proposals tothe Supreme Court's Rules Advisory Committees.   The administration is committed to the fair, efficient andearly resolution of disputes. To underscore this commitment,the administration will apply many of the suggested reformsto the conduct of litigation by the federal agencies.</TEXT></DOC>
