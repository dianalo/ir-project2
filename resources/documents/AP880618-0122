There was no indication on Friday that the civilian governmentof President Vinicio Cerezo will accept the rebels' latest call torenew peace talks. The first round ever held in 27 years of wartook place last October in Madrid, Spain, without visible results.   The influential military, which held direct control of thegovernment until permitting Cerezo's inauguration in January 1986,opposes more talks.   A scheduled meeting between the rebels and a nationalreconciliation commission was canceled after a failed military coupin May.   The text of the letter from the commanders of the rebelcoalition Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union to the head ofthe reconciliation commission was published in the daily newspapersEl Grafico and Prensa Libre Friday.   The letter accuses the government of defying a regional peaceplan signed by Cerezo and the presidents of four other CentralAmerican nations last year. The accord calls for negotiations toend the region's civil wars, of which Guatemala's is the longest.   The rebel union's statement says the army has secretlyintensified the war in a bid for all-out victory.   The rebel commanders propose direct, high-level talks with thegovernment during a cease-fire that would begin on July 1. Thetalks would focus on human rights guarantees and on a schedule for``dismantling the instruments of control of the population that nowexist.''   Human rights groups accuse the military of committing massiveviolations in a bloody anti-guerrilla campaign that began in thelate 1970s. The violence has diminished, but selective killings anddisappearances are still reported.   In the letter, the guerrillas also set out their conditions fora political solution to Guatemala's conflict. They said thegovernment must recognize the historical causes of the conflict,demonstrate a desire to end the war and recognize the rebel unionas a party to any negotiated settlement.</TEXT></DOC>
