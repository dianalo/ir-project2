The court, without comment, let stand rulings that dismissedstate Supreme Court Justice Rolf Larsen's suit against ThePhiladelphia Inquirer and The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.   As a result of various articles appearing in both newspapersabout Larsen, the state's Judicial Inquiry and Review Board beganan investigation in mid-1982.   In his suit, Larsen said the articles portrayed him as beinginvolved in ``political activity, racism, favoritism andinfluence-peddling.''   Completed in May 1983, the state board's investigationexonerated Larsen of any wrongdoing.   During the investigation, both newspapers published reportsabout the board's supposedly secret proceedings. Some articles evencontained excerpts of hearing transcripts.   Those reports were the basis of Larsen's suit, in which hecharged the newspapers with obtaining the transcripts illegally andpublishing only selected excerpts that placed him in a false light.   The suit, which sought monetary damages, also claimed that thearticles invaded Larsen's privacy and violated the confidentialityprovisions of state law.   A state trial judge dismissed most of the lawsuit's counts, andthat dismissal was upheld by a state appeals court.   The appeals court relied heavily on a 1978 ruling by thenation's highest court in a Virginia case.   In that decision, the justices said the free-press protectionsin the Constitution's First Amendment mean newspapers cannot becriminally punished for publishing truthful information aboutsecret governmental proceedings.   The decision struck down a Virginia law that made it a crime toreport about a state judicial commission's confidentialinvestigations into judges' fitness to hold office.   The Pennsylvania appeals court ruled that allowing Larsen'scivil suit would, like Virginia's criminal law, violate free-pressrights.   ``The imposition of monetary damages (civil sanctions) can bejust as inimical to and an encroachment of one's First Amendmentguarantees as criminal sanctions,'' the state court said.   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court refused to hear Larsen's ensuingappeal last Oct. 31.   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Larsen argued that thestate courts wrongly concluded that the newspapers' free-pressrights would be harmed if Larsen were allowed to sue overviolations of state confidentiality provisions.   Lawyers for the newspapers urged the justices to reject theappeal. They noted, among other things, that the state courtrulings left Larsen free to amend his complaint to explain hisassertion that confidential information was obtained ``illegally.''   The case is Larsen vs. Philadelphia Newspapers, 88-1274.</TEXT></DOC>
