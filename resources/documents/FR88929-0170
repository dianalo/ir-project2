TheAmerican people have long recognized that the liberty we cherish must includethe freedom to worship God as each of us pleases. We can all rejoice innoting that a critical step in the history of this freedom was taken nearlytwo centuries ago this month.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">On September 25, 1789, the Congress proposed and sent to the Statesfor ratification a series of 10 Amendments to the new Constitution. ThisBill of Rights would safeguard and perpetuate the rights and libertiesfor which the American people had fought the War of Independence and theStates had ratified the Constitution. Because of the First Amendment'svital clauses_``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishmentof religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; . . .''_the 199thanniversary of the introduction of the Bill of Rights is a fitting timeto begin a week i celebration of religious freedom.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The religious liberty described in this Amendment is the protectionof religion and conscience from government interference. It creates neitherhostility between government and religion nor a civil religion of secularism.The fundamental principle of religious liberty, that government can neitherforbid nor force the people's practice of religion, was essential to thefounding of our Nation. Our leaders knew that faith blesses men and nationsalike as it fosters morality and justice. George Washington stated in hisFarewell Address, ``Reason and experience both forbid us to expect thatnational morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.'' TheNorthwest Ordinance of 1787, which the Congress reenacted in 1789, similarlystated, ``Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good governmentand the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of learning shall foreverbe encouraged.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Founders realized that we must guard freedom of religion witheternal vigilance against tyranny and bigotry. Washington emphasized thisin a letter to Moses Seixas of the Hebrew Congregation of Touro Synagoguein Newport, Rhode Island, in 1790. Our first President noted Americans'``liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship'' and said that itwas not ``by the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyedthe exercise, of their inherent natural rights.'' Rather, ``happily theGovernment of the United States, . . . gives to bigotry no sanction, topersecution no assistance. . . .''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">President Washington proudly called this policy ``enlarged and liberal''and ``worthy of imitation.'' Through the years, Americans of goodwill haveechoed these sentiments, seeking freedom, brotherhood, justice, and reconciliation.We will always do so if we continue to revere the First Amendment's protectionof religious freedom.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Congress, by House Joint Resolution 518, has designated the weekof September 25, 1988, as ``Religious Freedom Week.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States ofAmerica, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution andlaws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week beginning September25, 1988, as Religious Freedom Week.

Thecourage and witness of thousands of students from these institutions werekey components of the civil rights movement. their words and action sparkedAmerica's conscience and helped lead to the ending of legal sanction forracial discrimination and segregation.
