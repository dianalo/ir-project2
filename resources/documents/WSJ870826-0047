Harris Jr.Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WIX </IN><TEXT>   Wickes Cos. established an $11.2 million after-tax reserve for costs related to a division's substandard carpeting, surprising Wall Street analysts who initially had estimated a crippling liability in the hundreds of millions of dollars.    Wickes had been hinting in recent months that the carpet problems were less severe than initially believed when it disclosed them in April, and securities analysts had responded by paring their numbers sharply. But the reserve taken by the Santa Monica, Calif.-based retailing and manufacturing concern, equal to $20 million pretax, still was far lower than most expectations.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Wickes shares closed at $20.25, up $2. It traded as high as $21.125 after an early-morning announcement that accompanied Wickes's earnings report for its second quarter ended Aug. 1.    Wickes posted net income for the period of $18.9 million, or 37 cents a share, down 30% from the $26.9 million, or 66 cents a share, a year ago. Before accounting for the carpeting charge, a tax credit and a loss on retirement of debt, Wickes reported operating profit of $27.4 million, or 55 cents a share, for the latest period, which included a $20 million pretax gain from sale of assets. In the 1986 period, operating profit was $20.7 million, or 48 cents a share, before a tax credit. Sales rose 30% to $1.45 billion from $1.11 billion.    &quot;For all intents and purposes the case is closed,&quot; Wickes Chairman Sanford C. Sigoloff said of the carpet problems. While he didn't break down specific components of the charge, the executive said much of the reserve reflects legal and other fees, the price of tracing and dealing with individual carpet customers, and the costs of &quot;obsoleting inventory.&quot;    In recent months Wickes has indicated that it expects very little carpet replacement, a remedy some analysts had expected initially when they estimated liability as high as $500 million.    Wickes spurred concern by analysts four months ago when it reported that its recently acquired Collins andamp; Aikman unit had sold for a decade about $360 million of polyvinyl chloride-backed carpet that didn't meet some local flammability and smoke-density standards. Wickes's auditor, Arthur Andersen andamp; Co., qualified its opinion on fiscal 1987 financial reports, citing the uncertain liability.    Wickes, which said yesterday that Arthur Andersen had indicated it would remove the qualification, in April assigned the job of determining liability to a &quot;task force&quot; of company officials and carpeting experts. Before yesterday, the company had steadfastly refused to estimate its potential exposure from the problem.    Wickes also has maintained that the carpeting -- about 30 million square yards, sold mostly to commerical and institutional customers such as hospitals, schools and offices -- was safe and hadn't been cited in any fire-related incidents.    The small size of the $20 million pretax charge &quot;was delightful and very unexpected,&quot; said H. Lloyd Kanev, who follows Wickes for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York. Smith Barney, in recently reducing its estimate of potential liability to no more than $50 million, had moved Wickes's stock to an &quot;accumulate&quot; recommendation from &quot;strong hold.&quot;    Mr. Kanev said that operating earnings at Wickes, excluding the carpet-related reserve, tax credit and the $20 million gain on sale of assets, reflected weakness in its apparel, automotive and other markets, but were close to what Wall Street had been predicting.    Anthony Pearce-Batten, an analyst with Baltimore-based Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc., blamed an &quot;information vacuum&quot; for Wall Street's &quot;patently unrealistic guesses as to what the damage would amount to.&quot; His estimates have proved lower than those of counterparts at other firms; his most recent estimate, made earlier this month, set liability at between $30 million and $50 million.    In a telephone interview, Mr. Sigoloff hailed Wickes employees for a willingness to &quot;jump into the fray and do a superb job&quot; to counter the carpet problems. He singled out the Collins andamp; Aikman personnel who first tipped Wickes off to irregularities at the unit, and other individuals who &quot;worked night and day to test and retest&quot; product suspected of being substandard.    Mr. Sigoloff also defended Wickes's decision to &quot;blow the whistle on ourselves&quot; at a time when it couldn't even guess the final cost of the carpet problem. When &quot;the possibility of a faulty product&quot; existed, he said, &quot;my moral value is such that we wouldn't put any of our product or any of our customers at risk.&quot;    Wickes had determined in its investigation of the carpet matter that some Collins andamp; Aikman employees, since fired, had a practice of sending phony carpet samples to an independent laboratory for testing. They then applied the results to carpeting they knew to be substandard. Wickes has maintained that the improper procedures weren't known to Collins andamp; Aikman executives, although there also have been several changes in top-level managment of the carpet concern in recent months.    For its six months, Wickes reported net income of $138.9 million, or $2.85 a share, nearly triple the $47.5 million, or $1 a share, in the prior year. Excluding extraordinary charges in both six-month periods, operating profit surged to $110.1 million, or $2.25 a share, from $36.5 million, or 65 cents a share. However, pretax gains on asset sales contributed $139.5 million to operating profit in the latest half, and only $3 million to operating profit in the year-ago half. Sales rose 42% to $2.99 billion from $2.11 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
