The area under the load P-shift of the points of load application{Delta} diagram, on which there is no information about the total specimenenergy at the time crack growth ceases in it, is ordinarily used in theexperimental determination of the elastic-plastic fracture viscosity(the limit values of the J-integral). At the same time the specimen itselfwith its stress-strain state in the neighborhood of the crack apex isthe carrier of this information. An experimental method is proposed inthis paper to determine the elastic-plastic fracture viscosity in thecrack halt stage J/sub a/ on thin-sheet plastic specimens with centralsurface notch on the basis of an analysis of the stress-strain stateat the crack apex, executed by using the method of dividing grids.</TEXT></DOC>
