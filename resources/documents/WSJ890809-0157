The National Space Development Agency of Japan and industry analysts played down the technical problem, saying the H-1 rocket probably could be fixed in the next few weeks.    It was the first time since 1975 that a technological glitch hampered a satellite launch here. But it comes just a month after the government was forced to announce it would postpone for one year the planned launch of its high-stakes next-generation rocket, the H-2. Engine problems have pushed back that program to 1993.    Despite its superiority in many high-technology industries, Japan lags far behind the U.S. and Europe in aerospace, and is sensitive to any perceived setbacks.    &quot;This morning's failure is just minor,&quot; said Eiichiro Sekigawa, a Japanese aerospace industry analyst. &quot;But following the occurrence of the H-2 {announcement}, it clouds the space program.&quot;    The launch was originally scheduled for earlier in the month, but was delayed by bad weather on three occasions. Yesterday's launch was set for 4:40 a.m. in southern Japan. Although the main engine started on time, it failed to ignite the rocket's boosters.    &quot;We think if we change some components we can launch the satellite&quot; by the end of September, Eijiro Hirohama, a space agency spokesman said. &quot;But we need to study it more.&quot;    Mr. Hirohama emphasized that the engines in the H-1 and H-2 rockets are different, so &quot;there is no relationship&quot; between the two problems.    Asked if the delay would hurt the space program, he said that &quot;if we can launch {soon}, I think it will have no effect.&quot; But if the launch is delayed longer, it could push back other planned launches.    Over the past decade, Japan has been pushing toward a long-term goal of space-technology independence from the U.S. and other countries. The rocket program is a major part of this effort.    The H-1 was developed with help from the U.S., and Japan doesn't have total control over its use. The H-2 will be the country's first completely indigenous rocket. However, even before last month's announced delay, analysts forecast problems for the H-2 because of high costs. </TEXT></DOC>
