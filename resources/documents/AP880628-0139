Minister of State Pedro de Castro Van-Dunem told reporters thatmultiparty democracy has failed elsewhere in Africa and would notenable Angola to fulfill the goal of achieving a national identity.   He said the solution for Angola is for the UNITA rebels, whohave waged war against the country's leftist government for 13years, to lay down their arms and participate in nationalreconstruction.   Van-Dunem, who was accompanied by two other senior Angolanofficials, met with reporters as UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi was onthe second day of a Washington visit aimed at rallying support fornational reconciliation talks between the warring parties. Savimbiwas to meet late Tuesday with Secretary of State George P. Shultz.   Last week, officials from the United States, Angola, Cuba andSouth Africa met for a second time in six weeks to discuss thepossibility of a peaceful settlement in Angola.   South Africa, along with the United States, supports Savimbi'smovement with military equipment and other items. South Africa sentseveral thousand troops to Angola last year. Some have beenwithdrawn and an undetermined number remain.   Van-Dunem said Angolan authorities are willing to talk to SouthAfrica but not to Savimbi's envoys because ``they are not themasters of their own interests.''   Angolan Justice Minister Fernando Franca Van-Dunem said he viewsthe UNITA insurgents as ``ancilliary forces'' of South Africa. Atanother point, he said that from the beginning, Savimbi ``hasalways appeared as a man sent by somebody else.''   The Reagan administration has been supporting Savimbi since1985, seeing him as an ally in its quest to encourage the removalof more than 40,000 Cuban troops based in Angola.   The administration also supports the concept of bringing an endto the fighting in Angola through national reconciliation talks.   But the Angolan representatives expressed strong opposition toachieving a peaceful settlement through an electoral process.   Van-Dunem, the justice minister, acknowledged that the Angolanpresident is not the product of an electoral process but said thecountry does elect representatives at the provincial and municipallevels. Some candidates, he added, are not members of the rulingMPLA party.   His colleague, the minister of state, said it is not the policyof the Angolan government to ``smash UNITA'' once peace is achieved.   ``We do not identify with the objectives of UNITA, which are toliquidate the people of Angola,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
