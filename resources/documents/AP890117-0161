Baker IIIdeftly sidestepped most direct questions Tuesday at his Senateconfirmation hearing, including queries about when the United Stateswould resume nuclear arms control talks with the Soviet Union.   But in his answers to questions from members of the SenateForeign Relations Committee, Baker made it clear that theadministration of President-elect Bush will largely adhere to pathslaid down by President Reagan, and will move cautiously when it doesdepart from those policies.   In the Middle East, in Central America, in South Africa _ alltrouble spots the new administration will be forced to grapple within its early months in office _ Baker disclosed no specific plansfor dramatic change, saying only that policies are under review andthat in some instances the Bush team will be open to new approaches.   As the scheduled two-day hearing opened, committee chairman Sen.Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., urged Baker to press for quick resumption ofstrategic arms control talks with the Soviets.   ``There is no more urgent priority facing you than to continuethe momentum in arms control with the Soviet Union, mostparticularly in the area of strategic nuclear weapons,'' Sen.Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the committee, said as Baker'sconfirmation hearing opened.   The START talks on deep cuts in strategic nuclear weapons havebeen recessed since November, and the incoming Bush administrationis reviewing U.S.-Soviet relations, including arms-controlnegotiating postures.   Pell and other lawmakers urged that the START talks be resumedquickly and without linkage to other negotiations, such as upcomingmultilateral talks on reductions in conventional forces.   Baker was noncommittal, saying he could not specify a date bywhich the talks will resume. ``We must take a hard look at ournegotiating position,'' Baker said, adding that Bush also will wantto review the nation's needs for strategic modernization.   But he noted that Bush has ``made it very clear he wants to buildon the progress made to date,'' and added, ``It is my thought thatwe should move forward with START talks without necessarily linkingthem to anything else.''   Opening the hearing, Baker read a statement calling for a newrelationship between Congress and the administration on foreignpolicy, and promised more extensive consultation with Capitol Hillthan was evidenced during President Reagan's two terms. He askedthat Congress reciprocate.   ``Yes, this is an appeal for a kinder, gentler Congress,'' Bakersaid, borrowing from Bush's campaign-trail promise of a ``kinder,gentler nation.''   He said if partisanship and division on some thorny issuescontinue, stalemate will be inevitable. ``When we held the linetogether, on Afghanistan, or throughout the INF negotiations, wesucceeded. When we did not _ in Central America _ the outcome wasunsatisfactory to everyone,'' he said.   He also called for renewed efforts to reach peace in the MiddleEast, a strong international effort to rid the world of the threatof chemical weapons and new efforts to address global environmentalproblems such as the greenhouse effect.   Baker, who was White House chief of staff during Reagan's firstterm and treasury secretary in the second, has little directexperience in foreign policy making. But his skill in dealing withCongress and in negotiations are widely respected, and confirmationseemed virtually certain.   On U.S.-Soviet relations, Baker said he remains wary of apparentmoves by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to restructure and openSoviet society. ``The Soviet Union remains a heavily armedsuperpower,'' Baker said. ``The talk is different, but the forcestructure and policies that support far-reaching interests andclients have not changed commensurately.''   Questioned about continued U.S. involvement in regional conflictsaround the world, Baker reiterated the new administration'sintention to continue U.S. support for the UNITA rebels in Angolauntil ``national reconciliation'' is achieved and said the newadministration ``cannot and must not'' abandon the Contra rebels inNicaragua.   But in Nicaragua, he added: ``Clearly, we need a differentapproach,'' perhaps including an economic development plan assistedby European and Japanese allies.   The standard for whether the United States will militarilysupport rebel movements _ a policy that has come to be called ``theReagan doctrine'' _ will be whether the group is a broad-basedliberation group, national in scope, ``that expresses the will ofthe people,'' he said.   During questioning on a wide range of issues, Baker also said:   _ That the new administration will undertake ``a full-scalereview'' of the issue of Third World debt. ``I believe there is roomfor more creative financing mechanisms that can result in areduction in the stock of debt,'' he said, suggesting thatfundamental changes in the economies of debtor nations may be neededas much as debt relief.   _ U.S. attempts to pressure South Africa to abandon its apartheidpolicy of official racism through economic sanctions have not hadthe desired results. ``We need to review our policy in SouthAfrica'' and reach agreement with Congress on a unified plan, hesaid. ``We ought to consider perhaps some creative ways to buildblack institutions in South Africa.''   _ A decision on a U.S.-approved Panamanian administrator for thePanama Canal, due in 1990, will have to await developments there.``I'm not sure it's in the best interests of the United States tosee us move forward down there under the current situation,'' inwhich strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega continues to hold powerin defiance of U.S. efforts to oust him. ``It is difficult to makeprogress on normalizing relations as long as Gen. Noriega remains incharge.''   _ The United States will recognize whatever government takespower in El Salvador after the March elections, provided theelections are ``free and fair and in the best democratictradition.'' He said the Bush administration will stand stronglyagainst any resumption of death-squad activity and might issue a newwarning to the Salvadoran government that such a resurgence mightlead to cutoff of U.S. aid.</TEXT></DOC>
