The statement appeared to be aimed at stemming a rash of killingsthat have left 106 Arabs dead since the Palestinian uprising beganin December 1987. Most of the dead were accused of collaborating,but some were suspected of drug sales or prostitution.   Nearly two-thirds of the deaths have occurred this year,including 13 in August and six this month.   The Israeli army says at least 245 collaborators have also beenwounded by fellow Arabs.   In their latest underground leaflet, leaders of the revolt saidPalestinians ``should refrain from rash decisions'' about suspectedcollaborators and consult the uprising leaders before warning orpunishing them.   ``A chance should be given to repent, and dialogue andwatchfulness should be employed as a better alternative thanpunishment,'' said the leaflet, which was circulated in the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip.   Israeli officials on Sunday announced that rules for shooting atsuspected enforcers of the uprising would be broadened. They saidIsraeli forces would be allowed to use live ammunition at any hourof the day or night to stop masked Palestinians trying to avoidarrest.   Sources said that previously troops could only use liveammunition in such circumstances at night.   There have been increasing reports that Israeli security forcesare arming collaborators. The Hebrew daily Maariv said today thatthe Arabs were also receiving weapons training.   In scattered clashes today in the territories, seven Palestinianswere reported wounded by army gunfire.   In the 21-month uprising aimed at ending Israeli rule, 557Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians, and39 Israelis have died in the violence.   Also today, two members of the Civil Guard were dismissed forfailing to act on reports that subordinates beat 20 Arabs threeweeks ago in a dormitory. Five of the Arabs were hospitalized.   The independent Yediot Ahronot said that in addition to beatingthe Arabs, the volunteer policemen took them to a rooftop andinsisted they hit each other.</TEXT></DOC>
