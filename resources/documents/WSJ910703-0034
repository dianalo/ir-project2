That's the bet being made by three of the mutual fundindustry's top-performing fund managers, all of whom arebullish on health care stocks. These stocks were dazzlingperformers in 1990 and early this year, though theirperformance in recent months hasn't been nearly so strong.</LP><TEXT>   Morris Smith, manager of Fidelity Magellan Fund, right nowhas 14% of his fund's $15.3 billion in assets invested inlarge drug companies and other health care stocks. That'smore than he has committed to any other industry sector.Fidelity colleague Michael Gordon, who runs the Boston fundgroup's biotechnology sector fund, says his &quot;view is aspositive as it's ever been&quot; when it comes to Amgen, thebellwether biotechnology stock.   John Kaweske of Financial Strategic-Health Sciences saysthe big drug companies, with their relatively predictableearnings growth, could outpace the market averages as theeconomic recovery turns out to be more tepid than investorscurrently expect.                                                                                                          10-YEAR LEADER                                                                                                          Fidelity Magellan Fund                     +583.63%                                                                                                          Fidelity Magellan Fund's Mr. Smith isn't given to grandpredictions about the direction of the stock market. But thatdoesn't stop him from being notably bullish.   The reason for Mr. Smith's optimism: He's looking down theroad, and what he sees is higher corporate earnings.   &quot;I don't know whether it's in 1992 or 1993 that we'll seethe explosion of earnings, but I do think earnings will betrending up,&quot; says Mr. Smith, 33 years old, who took over asMagellan's manager in June 1990. Under the stewardship of Mr.Smith and his celebrated predecessor Peter Lynch, Magellanhas returned 583.63% over the past decade, better than anyother fund.   Mr. Smith concedes that &quot;the market is expensive today&quot; ifyou look at the ratio of stock prices to current earnings.The 500 large company stocks in the Standard andamp; Poor's500-stock index, for instance, are currently trading atalmost 18 times trailing 12-month earnings.   But, argues Mr. Smith, &quot;you're looking at troughearnings.&quot; He points to the first quarter of 1989, when Sandamp;P500 earnings last peaked. If you seasonally adjust thoseearnings to arrive at a full year's profit potential, &quot;youprobably have the Sandamp;P earning $28 or $29,&quot; says Mr. Smith. Ifearnings recover to that level, the Sandamp;P 500 would stand atonly around 13 times earnings.   With his eye on recovering earnings and a rejuvenatedeconomy, Mr. Smith is heavily invested in so-called earlycycle stocks such as home builders, auto makers, mediacompanies and retailers, all of which he expects to do wellas the economy picks up steam.   But while Mr. Smith is favoring economically sensitivestocks, his biggest industry bet is on recession-resistanthealth care companies such as American Cyanamid andSchering-Plough, which he thinks are cheap compared withtheir expected earnings growth rates.   For the quarter, Magellan had a narrow loss of 0.14%,performing slightly better than the average stock fund.&quot;There's no doubt that we're going through a period of marketindigestion right now,&quot; says Mr. Smith. &quot;We're in a holdingpattern while the market waits for the economy to come alongand support the current valuations.&quot;                                                                                                          FIVE-YEAR LEADER                                                                                                          Financial Strategic-Health Sciences        +201.56%                                                                                                          Health care stocks have been tearing up the track for muchof the past decade, but top fund manager John Kaweske reckonsthe good times will keep on rolling.   Mr. Kaweske, who manages Financial Strategic-HealthSciences, the top-performing fund for the past five years,believes there are a couple of reasons to be optimistic aboutthe industry's long-term prospects.   He cites the need for medical attention among anincreasingly elderly population. The percentage of thepopulation aged 65 or over should reach 22% by the year 2030,up from 12% today.   Mr. Kaweske, 50, also says that the health care industryprobably spends more on research and development than anyother U.S. industry, a pattern that should continue totranslate into new and highly profitable medical treatments.   Over the months ahead, Mr. Kaweske is especiallyoptimistic about the prospects for big drug companies such asBristol-Myers Squibb, Merck and Schering-Plough.   Many of the big drug stocks have only kept pace with themarket averages so far this year. But Mr. Kaweske thinks thedrug stocks may pick up steam, as the economic recovery turnsout to be weaker than expected.   That, says Mr. Kaweske, will cause investors to switch outof cyclicals and economically sensitive stocks and intosteady growers like the drug companies.   Right now, Mr. Kaweske's biggest position isSchering-Plough, which accounts for 5% of the fund's $370million in assets. &quot;It has a lot to recommend it -- a goodrate of earnings growth, good product innovation and, mostimportantly, very attractive valuation,&quot; says Mr. Kaweske. Hethinks Schering, which earned $2.50 a share last year, willearn $3 a share this year and $3.60 in 1992. The stock closedyesterday at $51.375 a share in New York Stock Exchangecomposite trading.                                                                                                          12-MONTH LEADER                                                                                                          Fidelity Select-Biotechnology              +49.74%                                                                                                          After over two years of sizzling performance,biotechnology stocks have finally stumbled.   During the second quarter, companies such as Amgen, Chironand Immunex saw their shares smacked down 20% and more fromtheir peak prices, though some of the biotechnology stockshave since recouped part of the lost ground. &quot;I'm asoptimistic as I've been in several months,&quot; says MichaelGordon, manager of Fidelity Select-Biotechnology. &quot;The markethas beaten them down to the point where they're veryattractive.&quot;   Mr. Gordon's fund, which has the best 12-month record inthe mutual fund industry, has weathered the biotechnologyselloff moderately well. The fund, bolstered by its stake insome larger pharmaceutical companies, was down 3.69% in thesecond quarter. Assets of the fund have dipped to $485million today from $530 million three months ago.   &quot;I haven't been hit by big redemptions&quot; by departingshareholders, says Mr. Gordon, 26. &quot;I'm hoping, maybesomewhat naively, that the people who are in the fund at thispoint believe in the long term future of the stocks.&quot;   Mr. Gordon's biggest bet is on Amgen, which accounts forroughly 10% of the fund's assets. Amgen has two major drugson the market, Epogen, which stimulates red blood cellproduction, and Neupogen, which helps boost a patient'simmune system.   Mr. Gordon, 26, blames Amgen's recent weak stock marketperformance partly on investors' belief that earnings in thequarter just ended probably were lower than in the precedingquarter, when Amgen's bottom line got a boost from the launchof Neupogen.   But Mr. Gordon remains optimistic about Amgen's long termprospects. He says the company should earn $3.50 a share inthe fiscal year ending March 1992, and more than $5 a sharein the following year. Amgen closed yesterday at $116.125 ashare in national over-the-counter trading.   Biotechnology stocks are &quot;definitely going to haveshort-term bumps,&quot; says Mr. Gordon. &quot;I think we just had one.But the long-term message is still the same: People will bevery pleased if they invest in this group.&quot;   SECOND-QUARTER LEADER                                                                                                          Strategic Investments                      +34.39%                                                                                                          Every dog has its day, and Strategic Investments Fund gotits turn during the second quarter.   The $38 million fund, which specializes in South Africangold shares and has one of the worst long-term records in themutual fund industry, zoomed up 34.39% in the past threemonths as Johannesburg-traded gold stocks returned to favor.   &quot;I think there's a growing recognition on the part of alot of people that sanctions will be lifted against SouthAfrica, and so it will once again be socially acceptable toinvest in South Africa,&quot; says Leroy Brenna, the fund's64-year-old manager.   Mr. Brenna offers a laundry list of reasons for why evenbetter times lie ahead for South African gold stocks. Hethinks there could be a post-apartheid economic boom in SouthAfrica. He says gold may return to popularity as an inflationhedge because bonds are no longer serving that purpose due tofalling interest rates. And he believes that world demand forgold could get a boost from renewed Saudi Arabian buying nowthat the Gulf War is over.   &quot;There's a potential for a tremendous move,&quot; concludes Mr.Brenna.   Mr. Brenna is also hoping to leave behind some problems ofhis own. The Securities and Exchange Commission has beeninvestigating Mr. Brenna's fund group since 1987. Among theissues raised by the SEC: that Mr. Brenna -- through stockand warrants -- owned a 5%-plus position in a company inwhich one of his funds also had a stake, and that two of Mr.Brenna's funds violated their own investment policies bybuying more than 10% of a company's stock.   Mr. Brenna dismisses these issues as mere technicalities.&quot;It's like breaking speeding laws,&quot; he says. &quot;We've beentrying to get that thing settled with them for ages.&quot; Mr.Brenna says he hopes to sign a settlement with the SEC&quot;within the next 30 days.&quot;   ---        How the Biggest Stock Funds Have Performed                                                                                                          Percentage gains for periods ended June 30; assets as ofMarch 31                                                                                                                     ASSETS      SECOND    TWELVE   FIVE      TEN          (in billions)   QUARTER   MONTHS   YEARS    YEARS                                                                                                        Fidelity Magellan Fund              $14.8        -0.1%     9.8%    82.1%   583.6%                                                                                                        Windsor Fds:Windsor                7.6         0.7      2.3     53.5    334.2                                                                                                        Investment Co of America                7.0        -0.7      8.3     74.0    359.0                                                                                                                       6.4         0.4      8.6     66.7    374.6                                                                                                        Fidelity Puritan                4.7         2.1      7.2     55.8    314.0                                                                                                        Fidelity Equity-Inc                4.2         1.1      3.1     42.7    295.8                                                                                                        Templeton Fds:World                4.1         0.4     -2.2     49.4    265.5                                                                                                        Pioneer II                4.1         1.0     -1.5     46.8    227.0                                                                                                        American Mutual                3.8         1.7      7.3     61.0    323.0                                                                                                        Twentieth Cent:Select                3.7        -3.3      1.4     56.7    326.2                                                                                                        Affiliated Fund                3.5        -0.4      3.3     51.9    269.5                                                                                                        Dean Witter Div Gro                3.1         1.9      7.1     65.5    325.4                                                                                                        Windsor Fds:Windsor II                2.8        -1.7      7.6     62.5     N.A.
