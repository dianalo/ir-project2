Pursuant to Department of Defense and Department of theArmy regulations and regulations of the President's Council on EnvironmentalQuality, a decision on whether to proceed with the proposed action willbe made upon expiration of a 30 day period commencing with the date ofthis notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The HEDI technology program is one of the technologies being consideredin the Strategic Defense Initiative Program. It is currently in the ConceptExploration phase of the DOD systems acquisition process. The purpose ofthis EA is to analyze the environmental consequences of testing activitiesfor the HEDI technology development program in compliance with all pertinentregulations and agreements.Army Regulation 200-2 establishes policy, procedures, and responsibilitiesfor assessing the environmental effects of Army actions. It implementsDOD Directive 6050.1 which establishes the DOD environmental impact analysisprocess. This directive implements the National Environmental Policy Act(NEPA) of 1969 (Pub. L. No. 91-90 (1970), 42 U.S.C. 4321, 4331-4335, 4341-4347(1976) and the President's Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulationsfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA, (40 CFR Parts 1500through 1508).HEDI Technology Testing ProgramThe current HEDI concept would employ ground-based missiles to interceptand destroy hostile submarine-launched and intercontinental ballistic missilesin the terminal portion of their trajectory. The HEDI vehicle would consistof a two-stage launch vehicle (booster) and a kill vehicle with a conventionalwarhead. The basic thrust of the efforts already accomplished in ConceptExploration has been to assess the technical feasibility of HEDI in thecontext of a complete strategic defense system.The HEDI technology test program will be conducted in two parts. Each partwill test a particular aspect of the technology and provide informationand data necessary to make decisions for advancing to the next phase oftesting. The first part, which includes the Kinetic Kill Vehicle IntegratedTechnology Experiment (KITE), will consist of a number of test activitiesto be conducted at nine different testing sites culminating with a seriesof flight tests at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. These activitiesare catagorized as analyses, simulations, component/assembly testing, andflight testing. Part two includes the HEDI Experimental Test Vehicle (XTV)development, which is expected to conclude with two flight tests at theU.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll. The specifics of the HEDI XTV testing activitieshave not yet been defined; however, further environmental analysis willbe conducted as the program progresses and new information is identified.This EA, submitted in accordance with applicable directives and policiesand made available to the public, provides information on the potentialenvironmental effects of conducting the testing activities described andknown at this time.The locations of test activities for HEDI technology testing activitiesinclude the McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Company, Huntington Beach,CA; Vandenberg AFB, CA/Western Test Range; the National Test Facility,Falcon AFB, CO; Naval Surface Warfare Center, MD; Sandia National Laboratories,NM; White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), NM; the U.S. Army, Kwajalein Atoll(USAKA), Republic of the Marshall Islands; Arnold Engineering DevelopmentCenter, Arnold AFB, TN; and Hill AFB, UT. Of these, the major component/assemblytesting and flight testing will occur at USAKA and WSMR.In addition to the above test activities, a no action alternative was considered.An environmental impact analysis was conducted for test activities at eachlocation. An environmental assessment was prepared documenting the resultsof those analyses. To determine the potential for significant environmentalimpacts of HEDI technology testing, the magnitude and frequency of thetests that would be conducted at the proposed test locations were comparedto the current activities at those locations.The proposed test activities were evaluated to assess impacts in the followingareas: air quality, biological resources, cultural resources, hazardouswaste, infrastructure, land use, noise, public health and safety, socioeconomics,and water quality. As a result of that evaluation, consequences were assignedto one of three catagories: insignificant, mitigable and non-significant,or potentially significant.The following methodology was used. Environmental consequences were determinedto be insignificant if no serious concerns existed regarding impacts tothe affected area. Consequences were deemed mitigable and non-significantif concerns existed but it was determined that all of those concerns couldbe readily mitigated through standard procedures or by measures recommendedin existing environmental documentation. If serious concerns were identifiedthat could not be readily mitigated, the activity was determined to representpotentially signficant consequences.Insignificant environmental consequences were found for all test activitiesat McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Company, Huntington Beach, CA; ArnoldEngineering Development Center, Arnold AFB, TN; Hill AFB, UT; NationalTest Facility, Falcon AFB, CO; Naval Surface Warfare Center, MD; SandiaNational Laboratories, NM; and Vandenberg AFB, CA/Western Test Range.Mitigable and nonsignificant impacts resulting from flight testing of theHEDI were found at USAKA and at WSMR.Flight tests for HEDI XTV at USAKA will have mitigable and nonsignificantenvironmental consequences for infrastructure and socioeconomics (housing).Potential infrastructure impacts on water supply will be mitigated by constructionof a proposed desalination plant. Potential infrastructure impacts on thewastewater treatment system will be mitigated by participation in waterconservation procedures, continued wastewater monitoring, and participationin a wastewater treatment effectiveness study. Potential socioeconomic(housing) impacts which are a result of the anticipated housing shortagewill be mitigated by the construction of new housing units and the retentionof trailers beyond their planned phase-out date. Potential impacts fromsolid and hazardous waste will be avoided by requiring HEDI XTV contractorsto manage their waste in accordance with appropriate federal requirements.Flight tests for HEDI KITE at WSMR will have mitigable and nonsignificantenvironmental consequences for biological and cultural resources. Potentialbiological resource impacts will be mitigated by avoidance of threatenedand endangered plant and animal species. Potential cultural resource impactswill be mitigated by avoidance and/or data recovery of historic and prehistoricarchaeological sites.Finding of No Significant ImpactBased upon the foregoing, the U.S. Army Strategic Defense Command has concludedthat the proposed action, to conduct the HEDI technology testing program,would not significantly impact the human environment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>For Further Information Contact: </T2>Mr. Dru Barrineau, (205) 895-3632.Address: U.S. Army Strategic Defense Command, CSSD-H-SSP, Post Office Box1500, Huntsville, Alabama 35807-3801.<ITAG tagnum="34">Date: July 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lewis D.
