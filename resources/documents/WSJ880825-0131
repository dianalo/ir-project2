The agency acted on a petition requesting an investigation filed by lawyers for Jimmy Garrett, a teen-ager who was awarded $3.3 million by a federal court jury after alleging that the design of the Escort seat belt caused severe internal damage during a crash. Mr. Garrett is paralyzed from the waist down.    The petition asks the agency, a part of the Transportation Department, to require that Ford Motor Co. recall all Escorts and Lynxes manufactured since 1984 and repair the allegedly defective seat belts. The Mercury Lynx model was discontinued in 1987.    The petition alleged that an elastic strap used on Escorts and Mercury Lynxes to keep the rear belts from slipping behind the back seat could cause crippling injuries. According to the petition, the strap pulled the belt up from the hips, where it belongs, to the waist -- where it can do serious internal damage during an accident.    In a letter to the Garrett attorney, the highway safety agency said that after a technical review, it was &quot;unable to conclude&quot; that the elastic strap could adversely affect safety. But it added that the testing indicated the Escort and Lynx rear seat belts, with or without the elastic strap, fit differently from other models. So it said it began a mid-level investigation, called an engineering analysis, to see whether the different design can lead to safety problems.    Ford said in a statement yesterday that the Escort and Lynx seat belts are &quot;safe and effective&quot; and in compliance with all federal requirements. The company said it will cooperate with the investigation, and expressed confidence that &quot;no safety-related defect is involved.&quot;    Harold Sakayan, an attorney for the Garrett family, reacted glumly to the agency's decision. &quot;I think we're being finessed,&quot; he said. &quot;They're doing a study on top of a study. The purpose is delay or inaction.&quot;    The Garrett petition said that repairing the elastic strap problem simply required cutting off the strap with a pair of scissors.    Auto makers and government regulators for years have had evidence that lap belts alone aren't as safe as the combination lap-shoulder belts that are now standard in front seats. So far, however, regulators haven't mandated rear lap-shoulder belts. But in the face of mounting legal costs and consumer pressure, the major U.S. auto makers, including Ford, have dropped their opposition to the feature and now say they will make rear shoulder belts standard on most cars beginning in the 1989 model year. General Motors Corp. and American Honda Motor Co. also have been sued over injuries allegedly caused by rear seat belts. </TEXT></DOC>
