The crystals have been used as saturableabsorbers to modulate and control CO{sub 2} laser radiation. ReO{sub4}{minus}} ion concentrations in excess of 10{sup 17} cm{sup {minus}3}were achieved in KCl with good optical quality. The room temperatureabsorption of the ReO{sub 4}{minus}} ion in KCl was centered at 936.8cm{sup {minus}1} with 1.5 cm{sup (minus}1} linewidth and with absorptioncross section determined to be (0.46 + 0.02) {times} 10 {sup {minus}16}cm{sup 2}. The addition of Li{sup {plus}} as a second dopant resultedin a splitting of the ReO{sub 4}{minus}} resonance into two componentsat 957.5 cm{sup {minus}1} and 900.7 cm{sup {minus}1}. The characteristicallysharp resonance of ReO{sub 4{minus}} was not detected in NaCl grown withNaReO{sub 4} additions to the melt. Only with addition of Ca{sup ++}as a co-dopant was the ReO{sub 4{minus}} resonance observed. The absorption,detected as a very weak resonance through a 92 mm path length, was centeredat 946.0 cm{sup {minus}1} with linewidth of 5 cm{sup {minus}1} with linewidthof 5 cm{sup {minus}1}, overlapping the P(20) transition in the 10 micronCO{sub 2} band. 6 refs., 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
