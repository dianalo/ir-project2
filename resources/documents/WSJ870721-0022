BulkeleyStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/21/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> UIS WANB APCIEARNINGS (ERN)COMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   Unisys Corp. and Apollo Computer Inc. posted sharply higher second-quarter net income, and Wang Laboratories Inc.'s profit soared in its fiscal fourth quarter.    For the quarter, Unisys profit rose 59%, and Apollo's jumped more than sevenfold from a year earlier. Wang's profit for its quarter ended June 30 soared to $32 million from $800,000 in the depressed year-earlier period.    Unisys earnings slightly exceeded analysts' expectations and showed that the company remains on track following its formation in the Burroughs-Sperry merger. Apollo, a maker of computer workstations, has been benefiting from a boom in the market for its products. Wang's results, which were at the high end of analysts' estimates, reflect its success at controlling costs and boosting sales, the company said.    Unisys   Unisys revenue in the quarter increased 70% to $2.28 billion from $1.34 billion a year earlier.    Following the announcement, Unisys stock slipped $1, to $128.375, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply.    The computer maker continued to benefit from cost cutting, but revenue also exceeded most analysts' forecasts. Daniel Mandresh of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. said it's still too early to tell how much sales momentum Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys will be able to generate, but said cost-cutting should continue to buoy earnings well into next year.    Unisys's chief executive officer, W. Michael Blumenthal, said in an interview that &quot;the way things are going, we should be in the upper part of our range&quot; of full-year per-share earnings of $8 to $9 before a recent 3-for-1 stock split. He said he was encouraged because Unisys's product cycle, which was expected to boost sales in late 1988 and 1989, seemed to be attracting customers sooner than expected.    The company benefited primarily because the year-earlier results preceded the merger and didn't include Sperry's results. But, in addition, Unisys said it continues to make &quot;rapid progress&quot; in reducing costs and debt. It said debt fell to less than 35% of total capital at the end of the latest quarter, from 39% at the end of the first quarter and 55% at the time of the merger last year.    Unisys said results for the period also benefited from the weaker dollar, which increased the dollar value of its foreign revenue and earnings. The earnings increase would have been slightly greater except for a gain of $5.3 million a year earlier.    In the first half, Unisys net more than doubled while revenue climbed 90% to $4.69 billion from $2.47 billion.    Separately, an industry source said Unisys will announce today a new version of the operating system software for its work stations. A Unisys spokesman confirmed the broad outlines of the announcement.    The product will offer the ability to run more than one application software package simultaneously and will enhance the workstations' ability to handle data bases and to communicate in network with each other and with mainframes. Many of these features won't be available on International Business Machines Corp.'s new personal computers until 1988 or 1989, but the Unisys product will have limited impact because it is a proprietary system that will run just on Unisys machines.    Apollo Computer   Apollo's sales for the quarter rose 50% to $132.2 million from $88.4 million a year earlier.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Apollo shares fell 37.5 cents to close at $19, in the face of a declining market for most technology stocks.    Apollo benefited from the booming market for workstations, which are mostly used by engineers who design products on their large screens. Chelmsford, Mass.-based Apollo's archrival, Sun Microsystems Inc., based in Mountain View, Calif., has been growing even faster than Apollo.    Apollo said its growth reflected strong sales to existing customers and the addition of 150 new accounts during the quarter, raising its total number of accounts to more than 2,100.    In the first half, Apollo's net income rose ninefold, and sales increased 50% to $255.6 million from $170.4 million.    Wang Laboratories   Wang's revenue in the quarter rose 15% to $824 million from $716.8 million.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Wang shares rose 50 cents to close at $17.625.    Marc Schulman, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc., said, &quot;Things have improved, but I wouldn't say they're out of the woods.&quot; He noted that the company is easing off some cost controls, including ending a six-month 6% pay cut for salaried employees, and he predicted that new products from Digital Equipment Corp. will force Wang to lower some prices in the next two quarters.    In an interview, Frederick A. Wang, president of Lowell, Mass.-based Wang, said the company intends to be profitable in each quarter of its fiscal year ending June 30, 1988, and has set a goal of a 4% after-tax profit margin for the year as a whole. He added, &quot;We plan to grow (sales) in the area of 12% this year.&quot;    Wang said new orders in the latest quarter rose 12% to $718.2 million from $640.3 million. The increase would have been sharper if Wang hadn't eliminated $30 million of orders because customers, mostly in China, couldn't arrange financing for imports, the company said.    In contrast to past months when international business provided Wang's sharpest growth, Mr. Wang said that U.S. sales rose &quot;equivalently&quot; to international sales in the latest quarter. He said that more big customers are inquiring about products, and that Wang's biggest systems are selling better.    Despite the latest quarter's results, Wang reported a loss for the full year, as expected. Revenue rose 7.3% to $2.84 billion from $2.64 billion a year earlier.    ---                           1987              1986                        in      per       in      per    %                     millions  share   millions  share  chg.
