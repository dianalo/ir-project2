In a statement addressed to Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez,Mrs. Aquino said her adminstration has failed to enforce lawsbecause of a double standard favoring the rich.   ``Nothing impairs the credibility of government more than thecommon perception that we have two standards of justice, one for thepoor, and another for the rich and powerful,'' she said in thestatement, released to news media.   ``We have done nothing to disprove this perception. Until now wehave not secured the conviction of that elusive `big fish,''' sheadded.   ``I am now placing all of you under probation,'' she said. ``Atthe end of the year, we will assess your performance as individualsand a department. If I am not satisfied, I will not hesitate toexercise my power to remove appointees.''   Mrs. Aquino's former spokesman, Teodoro Benigno, says thepresident knows who the biggest offenders in the government andprivate sector are but has not moved against them because of a lackof evidence.   ``The president will need ... audacity in dealing with graft andcorruption,'' Benigno wrote recently in the newspaper The PhilippineStar. ``And she'll have to do away with that tired, old cliche thatshe needs proof.''   Mrs. Aquino ``knows who the big grafters are, who the big taxevaders are, who the big smugglers are. And I can assure her theentire nation will cheer if tomorrow she marches three of them topokey,'' Benigno said.</TEXT></DOC>
