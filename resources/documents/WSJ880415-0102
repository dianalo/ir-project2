The long-awaited decision leaves intact 17-year-old air-pollution standards affecting power plants, smelters and other boilers. Health and environmental groups accused the EPA of favoring industry over public health by refusing to limit short-term peak emissions of sulfur dioxide, which can cause problems for asthmatics exposed to certain concentrations for less than five minutes.    If the agency had switched and limited sulfur-dioxide emissions to an hourly level instead of a daily average, the tougher rules could have cost industry as much as $5 billion for new pollution controls, according to the Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade group.    But J. Craig Potter, the EPA's assistant administrator for air and radiation, said the agency by law couldn't and didn't take costs to the industry into account. The agency considered only health effects, he said, and concluded that current regulations &quot;are sufficient with an adequate margin of safety to protect public health.&quot;    The decision isn't the final word on sulfur-dioxide emissions, however. The agency said it will seek public comment for 90 days on whether to change its position and move to a one-hour standard. &quot;It's possible there may be additional information, or perhaps we've grossly underestimated the number of people that may be affected,&quot; Mr. Potter said.    In addition, Congress is considering limiting emissions of sulfur dioxide to help control the problem of acid rain.    The EPA didn't consider the acid-rain issue in its decision, but concentrated on health effects. Recent scientific studies have shown that asthma sufferers, who number 30 million according to the American Lung Association, can experience wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath at certain short-term levels of sulfur-dioxide emissions.    Since emission levels from a coal-fired plant vary during a day, environmental groups worry that asthmatics are exposed to unhealthy levels, even from a plant in full compliance with clean-air laws.    Although it was &quot;a tough call,&quot; Mr. Potter said, the EPA decided that changing the air-pollution standards to protect asthmatics from peak exposures wouldn't result in significant enough health gains. The EPA would be sparing only a small number of people from short-term, reversible effects, suffered primarily during exercise and by those not taking asthma medication, he said.    By EPA estimates, some 100,000 asthma sufferers living near coal-fired plants may be exposed to five-minute bursts of high sulfur-dioxide emissions each year. But fewer than 25,000 of them would suffer any effects, the agency estimated.    Environmental groups charged that the EPA isn't living up to the Clean Air Act, which requires air-pollution standards to protect public health. Robert Yuhnke, an attorney with the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund, predicted the agency's decision will be challenged in court, unless reversed by this or the next administration. &quot;The next administration seems to be the only hope,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
