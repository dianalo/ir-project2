The regional Bell holding company, which took a similar action last year, cited the &quot;increasingly competitive nature of the telecommunications business.&quot; A spokesman added, however, that the effort doesn't reflect any &quot;acute&quot; negative factors.    U S West said the incentive program won't affect 1987 earnings because the resulting savings will offset costs of the plan. The spokeman declined to comment on the impact the move will have on first-quarter results.    But securities analysts said they don't expect the company's first-quarter results to be much different from the depressed year-earlier figures. In the 1986 first quarter, U S West's profit fell 8.9% to $179.9 million, or $1.89 a share, largely because of a $114 million charge related to an early retirement incentive program during that period.    U S West said its Mountain Bell, Northwestern Bell and Pacific Northwest Bell units employ about 17,000 managers. While terms of the plans vary among the three units, each includes such items as special leaves of absence and payments based on length of employment, U S West said.    U S West had 69,375 employees at the end of 1986 compared with slightly more than 73,000 when the Bell system was broken up Jan. 1, 1984. </TEXT></DOC>
