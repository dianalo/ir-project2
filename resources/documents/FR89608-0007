Congress amended section6 in 1983 to substitute the Director of the Office of Foreign Missionswithin the Department of State for the President, and added the conditionthat the liability insurance requirements ``reasonably be expected to affordadequate compensation to victims.'' The Director of the Office of Foreign Missions has determined that an adequatelevel of liability insurance is provided by policies with limits of $100,000per person and $300,000 per incident for bodily injury and $100,000 perincident for property damage or of $300,000 combined single limit for allbodily injury and property damage from a single incident.
