The council, known for its human rights achievements, is theoldest post-World War II body promoting European cooperation.   ``It is certainly a great day for me and for all Hungarians tobe admitted into Europe and the Council of Europe,'' ForeignMinister Geza Jeszenszky of Hungary told a news conference in the17th-century Barberini Palace in central Rome.   He said membership in the Council of Europe ``is an additionalprotection for the newborn democracy in Hungary.''   Jeszenszky explained that if Hungary did not maintain high humanrights and democratic standards, it would be forced to leave the41-year-old Council.   He spoke hours after he and Council Secretary-General CatherineLalumiere signed documents admitting Hungary and committing it tothe council's human rights treaty.   ``When the time came, Hungary was bold enough to open a hole inthe Iron Curtain,'' Ms. Lalumiere told council ministers gatheredaround the table in the gilt-edged room.   ``The leaders and indeed the people have contributed so much tobringing the division of Europe to an end.''   The ministers then watched on TV as the red, white and greenHungarian flag was raised along the other 23 members' flags at theCouncil of Europe offices in Strasbourg, France.   Czechoslovakia and Poland are expected to join the Council ofEurope soon. Like Hungary, they made a dramatic, peaceful switchfrom Communist dictatorship to democracy.   The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have observer statusand Romania and Albania may become observers soon.   Tuesday's signing came at the start of a daylong meeting byCouncil of Europe foreign ministers.   During the session, they invited the Soviet Union to sign thecouncil's treaty on cultural exchanges. They also condemned Iraq'sdetention of hundreds of foreigners since its invasion of Kuwait onAug. 2.   In a statement, the ministers ``agreed that unity of actionwould present the best chances for the unconditional release of allthe hostages.'' The declaration was an implicit criticism ofEuropean politicians who have traveled to Baghdad to win freedomfor their fellow citizens.   The Council of Europe has produced 130 international treaties.It is best known for the European Human Rights Convention andEuropean Court of Human Rights, whose rulings are binding oncouncil members.   Hungary applied for council membership a year ago, when reformCommunists were still in power. A government dominated by thecenter-right Hungarian Democratic Forum was formed last summerafter the first free multiparty elections in four decades.   The council is seeking to increase its influence in human rightsissues and possibly develop a parliament bringing together theUnited States, Europe and the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
