The Directors Guild of America called the first strike in its 51-year-history Saturday after union negotiators rejected final offers in two sets of negotiations, one with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, representing more than 200 movie and TV producers, and the other with the three major TV networks. Union contracts with the two groups expired June 30.    The union said it would strike NBC, Warner Bros. and Columbia Pictures. The movie studios are units, respectively, of New York-based Warner Communications Inc. and Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co.    If NBC is struck, CBS Inc. said it will tell its Guild staff members not to come to work, a CBS spokesman said. Sidney Sheinberg, president of MCA Inc., said he hopes the producers will also stick together.    Officials of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., which owns the third major network, couldn't be reached for comment, nor could leaders of the motion picture alliance. The Associated Press reported that a spokesman for film and television producers said all members of the Directors Guild will be locked out if the strike is carried out.    If the walkout spreads to all three networks and all the alliance's studios, it could cripple movie and TV production. Theatrical motion pictures won't be immediately affected, since most of the industry rushed to finish movies by June 30.    A strike likely would have an immediate effect on news, sports and some daytime TV production at the affected networks. Any strike of more than a month would probably delay the prime-time television season this fall.    While the networks stockpiled episodes of important shows in anticipation of a strike, they haven't received episodes of some returning series and many new series. For example, an NBC spokesman said NBC doesn't yet have any episodes for the &quot;Cosby Show,&quot; &quot;Family Ties,&quot; &quot;Cheers&quot; or &quot;L.A. Law,&quot; its big hits.    Where episodes are lacking, the networks would probably have to air reruns and movies, which could help profits in the short run by reducing the cost of programming, analysts said.    Talks with the motion picture producers, whose contract covers more than 90% of the union's members, were stuck on the issue of residuals, the payments directors get for subsequent uses of their work. The issue is important because revenue from television, cable, and videocassettes has skyrocketed, and the directors' contract is widely seen as a precedent for other entertainment unions.    As for the networks, which employ more than 400 Directors Guild members, the two sides are said to disagree on such issues as a network demand for freedom to lay off union members without regard to seniority. But Day Krolik III, NBC vice president for labor relations, said the differences &quot;are not insurmountable,&quot; and &quot;there's time to work out an agreement.&quot;    More than 250 mostly smaller production companies have already signed separate agreements with the Directors Guild that would let them keep working in the event of a strike.    Some analysts believe the union is reluctant to launch a full-scale confrontation on its own.    &quot;The selective thing tells me they really don't want to strike,&quot; said Dennis I. Forst, who follows the entertainment industry for Security Pacific Bank.    Guild spokesman Chuck Warn said he wouldn't comment on why the three strike targets were chosen, or whether the strike would be expanded.    NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., is already being struck by 2,800 members of the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians. An NBC official said federal mediators have called a meeting of negotiators for the 2,800 network and striking technicians and news employees for next Monday.    Meanwhile, a strike by the Screen Actors Guild against four of the five big cartoon studios continues. It involves the roughly 300 actors who do perform as cartoon voices. The union is demanding a shorter workday and extra money for performing multiple characters. </TEXT></DOC>
