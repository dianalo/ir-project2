Although the South African government denied involvement, theForeign Office appeared to implicate Pretoria when it spoke of``the grave concern with which Her Majesty's Government viewed theinvolvement by South African officials in this affair.''   It gave the South Africans one week to withdraw First Secretaryfor Information Jan H.P. Castelyn, Counselor Jonathan Fourie, andStaff Sgt. Mark Brunner, who works in the defense attache's office.   While there was no suggestion they were implicated in theaffair, their expulsion is a rebuff at a time when Pretoria'srelations with Britain seemed to be warming.   It came two weeks after French police raided a Paris address andarrested a South African diplomat, an American arms dealer andthree militant Protestants from Northern Ireland.   The Northern Irelanders, one a warrant officer in the province'sTerritorial Army, allegedly were handing over parts of a Blowpipe,a shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile manufactured in Belfast.   British officials say they are gravely concerned by charges theSouth Africans were supplying weapons to the Protestants inexchange for the missile parts.   The arrested South African, identified by French sources asDaniel Storm, was released after claiming diplomatic immunity. Aweek later, the French government expelled three South Africanofficials implicated in the affair.   The three Irishmen and American Douglas Bernhart are being heldin France on gun-running and conspiracy charges.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took the lead in ordering theexpulsions, angered that she should be repaid in such a manner fordefending South Africa against a world drive for economicsanctions, said the domestic Press Association news agency.   The Foreign Office said Permanent Undersecretary Sir PatrickWright summoned South African Ambassador Rae Killen and informedhim of the expulsions.   Wright warned that South Africans should be ``under noillusions'' about how gravely London views the affair.   He reminded that South Africa is under a U.N. arms embargo, andthat ``the lives of innocent people are at risk'' in NorthernIreland.   British press reports say the South Africans are even moreinterested in the Blowpipe's sophisticated successor, theStarstreak. This week, newspapers reported that two techniciansfrom Shorts, the state-owned manufacturer of Blowpipe andStarstreak, have been hired at four times their salaries to workfor the South African arms industry.   South African Defense Minister Gen. Magnus Malan acknowledged onApril 24 that South Africa sometimes uses ``unconventionalmethods'' to get around the arms embargo.   President P.W. Botha called the Blowpipe affair a``transgression'' he regretted, while Malan said an officialinquiry showed Storm acted without government approval.   Malan said he regretted the embarrassment caused to the British,French and Irish governments and would make sure it did not happenagain.</TEXT></DOC>
