The 50% inhibitory dose for these cells was 120microM, and after 24 h at a cytostatic concentration (480 microM) S-phasearrest was observed by DNA flow cytometry. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphatepools were all reduced (dATP, dGTP, and dCTP by 50%, dTTP by 25%), suggestinginhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. Administration of tracer amounts(0.5 microM) of either [3H]uridine or [3H]deoxyuridine confirmed thatDNA synthesis had been inhibited to 20% of control rates by gallium.Further, the flow of the ribonucleoside into the dTTP pool and DNA wasselectively reduced compared to that of the deoxyribonucleoside. Galliumdecreased the specific activity of dTTP labeled from uridine by 50%,whereas the specific activity of dTTP labeled from deoxyuridine was increased2.5-fold. Thus counts in DNA derived from [3H]uridine were decreasedby more than 80%, while counts in DNA derived from [3H]deoxyuridine werevirtually unaltered. Uridine incorporation into RNA was not affected.Gallium did not significantly alter the capacity of permeabilized naivecells to incorporate [3H]dTTP into DNA, while 24-h gallium pretreatment(which increased the percentage of S-phase cells) produced a modest increasein [3H]dTTP incorporation, indicating that any effect of gallium on DNApolymerase alpha is minor. Gallium treatment did not induce or inhibitthe repair of DNA single strand breaks. These data demonstrate that galliuminhibits replicative DNA synthesis, with the major specific enzyme targetprobably being ribonucleotide reductase.</TEXT></DOC>
