While financial terms weren't disclosed, people close tothe heated bidding among several companies in the past fewmonths said the price is above $350 million.</LP><TEXT>   LTV put the businesses up for sale in May to help it raisecash for its reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws.The businesses had $1.7 billion in 1991 revenue and generatedroughly $100 million in operating profit. They build largeparts of the B-2 Stealth bomber and the C-17 military cargoplane, make a range of missiles and do significant StrategicDefense Initiative work, and build tail sections for BoeingCo. jetliners as part of a strong commercial segment.   The proposed transaction involves Lockheed and MartinMarietta each owning 50% of a new company, to be calledVought Corp. Dallas-based LTV said current management isexpected to continue at the helm of Vought, which will haveits own independent board of directors.   Separately, Lockheed said fourth-quarter net income rose4% to $103 million, or $1.63 a share, from last year's $99million, or $1.57 a share, on a 7.1% decline in sales to$2.76 billion from $2.97 billion. In its financial statement,released before the Vought agreement was announced, Lockheednoted progress in its effort to increase its mix ofcommercial business in a time of shrinking defense budgets.At the end of 1991, about 30% of its business wasnon-military, up from 26% a year earlier.   But in an interview, Lockheed Chairman Daniel Tellep saidthat the plan to form a company owning half of the LTVbusinesses &quot;doesn't signal a change from our long-termstrategy of lessening our dependence on defense.&quot; Lockheed'sview, he said, is that &quot;you can't foreclose on an extremelyattractive opportunity,&quot; such as the arrangement with MartinMarietta, in the military sector.   Mr. Tellep estimated that if the transaction is completed,as he expects it to be before midyear, it would fulfillsecurities analysts' estimates of a contribution to Lockheedearnings of about 10 cents a share in 1992. After that, hesaid, he is comfortable with estimates that &quot;we can add 20 to35 cents a share beginning in 1993 and going through 1996.&quot;   &quot;The synergies are incredible&quot; between the LTV businesses,Lockheed and Martin Marietta, said Howard Rubel, an analystwith C.J. Lawrence Inc. For both the acquiring companies, hesaid, &quot;there is a payback as quick as four or five years&quot; forthe investment, &quot;and there is going to be positive cash flowfrom day one.&quot;   Lockheed and Martin Marietta had been considered thefront-runners in bidding for the LTV operations in recentweeks. Among other parties said to have bid were Frenchelectronics giant Thomson S.A. and Carlyle Group ofWashington, D.C., through a jointly made offer, and BoeingCo. A Carlyle spokesman didn't return a phone call, andBoeing said it doesn't comment on reports about possibleacquisitions.   A spokesman for Martin Marietta, based in Bethesda, Md.,wouldn't comment on the bidding except to say that the LTVbusinesses had sparked &quot;a lot of interest.&quot; He called thecombination of LTV aerospace operations with Martin Marietta&quot;a perfect match.&quot;   The LTV missile unit makes the Multiple Launch RocketSystem and the Army Tactical Missile System. The aerospaceunit, while a major subcontractor for Northrop Corp.'s B-2bomber and McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s C-17 transport, alsomakes tail structures for Boeing's 747s, 757s and 767s. Thetwo units have about 13,400 employees.   In the interview, Lockheed's Mr. Tellep took special noteof the airliner-parts business, which he said generated $400million of sales for LTV last year. &quot;Strategically, Lockheedhas aspired to getting into that non-defense area,&quot; he said.He said the C-17 &quot;has received very strong support&quot; in theBush administration's recent budget review. And in studyingprospects for work on the B-2, now proposed to end after 20aircraft, Lockheed had &quot;assumed it might be terminated at15.&quot;   The plan to set up a separate company to hold the LTVbusinesses, said Mr. Tellep, who is a close friend of MartinMarietta Chairman Norman Augustine, eliminates &quot;risks whichcould occur directly to Lockheed or Martin,&quot; includingpotential problems relating to environmental or pensionfunding requirements.   LTV said it expects a definitive agreement in 10 days totwo weeks, but noted that any pact is subject tobankruptcy-court approval. Proceeds will be used as part ofLTV's Chapter 11 reorganization plan. The company has saidthat a substantial portion of the funds will be used tosettle a dispute with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. overa $3 billion shortfall in its pension plans.   ---   Karen Blumenthal in Dallas contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
