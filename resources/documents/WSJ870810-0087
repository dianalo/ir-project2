The exchange sent letters Friday to between 100 and 150 of its roughly 350 member firms establishing the deadline. The letter affects firms that have unsettled transactions of #100,000 ($157,000) or more outstanding for more than four weeks.    The move marks the exchange's latest effort to curb the growing backroom backlog. Inadequate settlement procedures and a surge in trading volume since last October's sweeping deregulation of the London financial markets have led to the backroom troubles.    Securities firms are facing a mountain of unsettled transactions, currently estimated at #6 billion ($9.46 billion). Some transactions are taking as long as two months to clear, compared with the expected two weeks.    Michael Baker, the official supervising the exchange's efforts to resolve the backroom problems, said that firms who fail to meet the deadline without a valid explanation will be fined. It wasn't immediately clear what would serve as a valid explanation. An exchange official said that &quot;firms that haven't done anything at all&quot; by the Aug. 28 deadline are the ones most likely to be fined. That may be very few firms; most exchange members have already begun efforts to beef up settlement staff and reduce the paper backlog.    An exchange official said that the level of fines hasn't yet been decided. &quot;We'll be looking at the level over the next few weeks,&quot; the exchange official said.    The letters followed a series of meetings last week between exchange officials and member firms over the settlement problems. The exchange had earlier announced a series of possible measures including fines, public disclosure and possible trading restrictions for those firms that don't take steps to reduce the backog. </TEXT></DOC>
