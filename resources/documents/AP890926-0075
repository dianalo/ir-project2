A 3-day-old truce, which halted six months of fighting betweenthe Syrian army and Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun's forces, was``generally holding'' with no serious violations, police said.   Sporadic sniper fire crackled along Beirut's dividing GreenLine, but that has become a daily ritual.   ``The military battle is not over yet and will not be finishedon the basis of a new sectarian compromise contained in thecommittee's draft plan,'' declared Walid Jumblatt, leader of theSyrian-backed Druse Moslem Progressive Socialist Party.   His remarks, published by the independent An-Nahar daily,reflected the hostility between Syria's Moslem and leftist alliesand the Christians who have long dominated Lebanon's politicalsystem.   Shiite Moslem militia chieftain Nabih Berri also criticized theproposed reforms, which aim to split power equally, saying theywere ``not enough.''   ``The constitution which they want to change gives us more thanthe Arab committee's plan for reforms,'' he said.   Berri did not elaborate. But he has been insisting thatLebanon's 1.2 millin-strong Shiites, the country's largest sect,should have a greater share of power than other sects.   The remarks by Jumblatt and Berri underlined the fragility ofthe cease-fire, brokered by an Arab League committee, that tookeffect Saturday.   The truce was part of a seven-point peace plan forged by KingFahd of Saudi Arabia, King Hassan II of Morocco and PresidentChadli Bendjedid of Algeria in an effort to end the civil war thathas claimed more than 150,000 lives.   The criticism came as Arab League mediator Lakhdar al-Ibrahimi,an Algerian, met Christian legislators to discuss a planned meetingby Lebanon's parliament in Saudi Arabia on Saturday on the proposedpolitical reforms.   Ibrahimi, deputy secretary-general of the Arab League, latertold reporters: ``The ball's now in the legislators' court.''   Legislator Jibran Taouk said Maronite deputies will ``announceour stand on the reforms Wednesday after a meeting with Gen. Aoun.''   Beirut's leftist As-Safir daily reported that Aoun was also``exerting pressure on Christian parliamentary deputies prior totheir departure for Saudi Arabia.''   Aoun, a Maronite, was believed to be pushing the Christiandeputies not to give too much away in Saudi Arabia.   The venue was selected because it will allow the deputies todiscuss the reforms far from any pressure by the powerful militialeaders.   The militias do not have representatives in parliament, whichwas elected in 1972. The civil war has prevented elections and theHouse has regularly renewed its four-year mandate.   A Sunni Moslem parliamentary deputy, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said the warlords were ``upset because deep down theydon't want an end to the war.   ``It gave them privileges which they'll lose the moment peaceprevails. A parliamentary meeting is stripping them of thecapability to steer events. That's why they're rejecting in advancewhat we'll agree on in Saudi Arabia,'' he said.   The Arab League peace plan calls for ending the Christians' 45years of domination of Lebanon's political system.   The Shiites, long downtrodden but now the most powerful Moslemfaction in Lebanon, in particular are demanding sweeping reformsthat would strip the Maronites of their privileges.   At the Vatican today, Pope John Paul II issued the Vatican'sfirst formal appeal to Moslems and pleaded for their help in savingLebanon.   ``Let your voices be heard, and even more, unite your effortswith those who demand for Lebanon the right to live,'' the popesaid.   The pontiff also said ``I firmly intend'' to go to Lebanon but aVatican spokesman said no immediate trip was planned.</TEXT></DOC>
