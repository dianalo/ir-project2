Rejecting the appeal by the three as premature, the three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn't rule on the merits of the argument that some of the congressional testimony the defendants gave under limited immunity from prosecution subsequently was used illegally to help build a criminal case against them. The unanimous decision by Judges Douglas Ginsburg, David Sentelle and James Buckley -- all of whom were nominated to the appeals court by President Reagan -- removes a major stumbling block for trials against the three men on conspiracy, fraud and other charges. The first trial, involving retired Marine Lt. Col. North, is expected to begin sometime after the November elections.    But in one section of the opinion, the judges suggest that down the road they may look favorably on some of the legal challenges raised by the defendants. &quot;Appellants may ultimately be correct in their assertion,&quot; the judges said, that if grand-jury action was tainted by the use of immunized testimony, &quot;dismissal of the indictment will be required to remedy the harm.&quot;    The judges ruled that U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell, who refused to dismiss the charges, will have the opportunity both during and after trial to resolve the issues raised by the defendants. &quot;Any errors that remain&quot; after that, the judges ruled, &quot;may become the subject of review on direct appeal.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
