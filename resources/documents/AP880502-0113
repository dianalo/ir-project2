The justices, by a 6-2 vote, said such a ``vertical restraint''imposed by a manufacturer on a retailer becomes illegal only when``it includes some agreement on price or price levels.''   The decision, a significant one for antitrust law, is a victoryfor Sharp Electronics Corp. and a setback for a former Houstonretailer of Sharp calculators.   Business Electronics Corp., owned and operated by KeltonEhrensberger, was the exclusive retailer of Sharp calculators inHouston from 1968 to 1972.   During that period, Sharp became dissatisfied with BEC'sperformance. Sharp contended that it was unhappy with BEC's failureto meet sales quotas but a federal jury found that Sharp wasdissatisfied with BEC's policy of selling calculators at priceslower than those suggested by Sharp.   Sharp in 1972 appointed Hartwell's Office World as a secondretailer of its calculators in Houston, and in 1973 terminatedBEC's dealership. Hartwell had told Sharp that it o the best possible jobathome before expanding coverage elsewhere, he said.   Ingersoll, who took over the family newspaper business when hewas 27, has focused on buying newspapers and turning them around bymodernizing and streamlining their operations and targeting theirmarkets.   ``Lean, capable management is at the heart of all successfulcompanies,'' said Ingersoll, whose company has a 1988 revenueprojection of $706 million with an operating cash flow of about$180 million.   Ingersoll said one of his corporate goals is to take advantageof opportunities in European countries and eventually to turn thecompany into an American-owned international publishing company.</TEXT><HEAD>Judge Bans Press In Surrogate Case</HEAD><TEXT>   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ A judge has barred the press from a hearinginvolving a custody fight between a couple and a surrogate mother,saying the case was essentially a closed-door adoption proceeding.   Superior Court Judge Lloyd von der Mehden issued his rulingApril 25 despite appeals by attorneys representing several SanFrancisco Bay area news organizations, including the San FranciscoChronicle, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat, the Marin IndependentJournal and San Francisco television station KRON.   Nancy Barrass signed a contract in 1985 to bear a child for Timand Charlotte Myers of Napa after being artificially inseminatedwith sperm provided by the husband. She was paid $9,000 when theboy was born in 1986.   Barrass, a Novato resident, says she had no intention of givingthe couple full custody of the child. She wants to be legallyrecognized as the boy's mother and granted liberal visitationrights.   The case is ``more than just a normal adoption matter,'' saidRobert Faux, one of the attorneys who want the hearing opened.   ``It's important to have the facts and issues before the publicbecause this is a whole field that has great importance to thepublic,'' he said.   He also said secrecy was not needed because the names of allparties in the case are already known and have been mentioned inearlier news stories.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
