(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker once bought a 12-carat, $22,000raw diamond to provide for his retirement and took out insurance ona series of ever-larger boats, witnesses said at the evangelist'strial today.   Ernest Perry, owner of Perry Jewelry Emporium in Charlotte, saidBakker told him that the 12-carat stone, as well as an eight-caratdiamond Bakker purchased, would be ``a good investment for hisretirement.''   Another witness, Carolyn Smith, of the Jerry Tuttle Insuranceagency in Charlotte, testified the Bakkers' homeowners policy valuedtheir personal property at $134,000 for the period June 1, 1986,through June 1, 1987.   The policy covered such things as a $45,000 diamond ring, a$27,000 diamond ring and a $29,000 diamond bracelet, and the premiumwas paid by PTL, she said.   Ms. Smith said Jim and Tammy Bakker also insured successivelylarger boats: in 1978, an 18-footer valued at $8,600, in 1984, a19-footer valued at $10,000, and in 1986, a 22-footer valued at$29,000.   Bakker is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy andfaces 120 years and prison and more than $5 million in fines ifconvicted. Prosecutors say he used nearly $4 million in ministryfunds to finance a lavish lifestyle.   Mrs. Bakker, in an interview broadcast on the ``Donahue'' showthis morning, denied the couple did anything wrong. She has not beencharged in the case.   ``We know inside we are not guilty,'' she said in an interviewwith Phil Donahue taped in Charlotte on Friday and broadcast today.``If I was guilty, I'd hide my head, but when you're not guiltyyou're not guilty.''   The growing evangelical empire, which included the Heritage USAtheme park near here as well as their nationally televised religiousprogram, ``got to where it didn't even feel a part of us,'' Mrs.Bakker said. ``We almost couldn't catch up with it. ... I felt likea little girl who didn't know where she was supposed to be.''   A former top executive at the TV ministry was scheduled totestify this week against Bakker. Until Richard Dortch pleadedguilty Aug. 8, prosecutors were planning to try him with Bakker.Dortch was sentenced to eight years in prison.   In cross-examining other witnesses, Bakker's attorney, HaroldBender, has sought to create an impression that Dortch directed someof PTL's most excessive spending.   Dortch, who was released from a Florida hospital last week afterfive days for treatment of an undisclosed ailment, is expected totestify that Bakker called the financial shots.   Bender and co-counsel George T. Davis aren't saying whetherBakker will take the stand, and neither is Bakker, who quit PTL in asex and money scandal in 1987.   Also expected to testify this week against Bakker is former aideJames Taggart, who, with his brother, David, was convicted in Julyof tax evasion and conspiracy over their use of PTL cash advancesfor personal purchases.   On Friday, David Taggart was sentenced to more than 18 years inprison and James to more than 17 years.   Mrs. Bakker will not testify, lawyers said.</TEXT></DOC>
