Inthe case of a subsea development the reliability of the components used,together with the flexibility of the design to overcome unit failuresand minimise risks, contribute significantly to a successful project.The objective of this paper is to identify some of the primary factorsto be considered in the development of a safe, reliable and economicsubsea project. Practical experience gained during the conceptual evaluationand detailed engineering design of various North Sea subsea developmenthas been used in preparation of the paper. 3 drawings, 1 table.</TEXT></DOC>
