The Commerce Department said the gross national product, thebroadest measure of economic health, grew at an annual rate of 2.7percent in the third quarter, slightly higher than the 2.5 percentrate originally reported last month.   Earlier this year, economists had widely forecast only sluggishgrowth in the quarter, but the revision means the third quartertopped the 2.5 percent second quarter rate.   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwatersaid, ``We always like to see increase in growth. And this reportis relatively good news in that sense.''   However, private analysts predicted with near unanimity asharply weaker performance in the final three months of 1989 andthe first quarter of next year. A few expect the nation to toppleinto a recession, ending the expansion, which enters its eighthyear in December.   ``We should enjoy these (third quarter) numbers because thechances are we're not going to see their like anytime soon,'' saideconomist Robert Dederick of Northern Trust Co.   Most economists attribute the current sluggishness to ayear-long anti-inflation campaign by the Federal Reserve Board,which pushed interest rates up through this spring.   Since then, the Fed has nudged rates lower, but the economywon't reflect the full benefit of rate cuts _ and any furtherdeclines in the next few months _ until later next year.   ``The reason the economy will skirt a recession, but not fallinto one, is interest rates are coming down substantially,'' saideconomist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch. He predicted a furtherdecline in rates next month.   In other economic news, an administration source who spoke onthe condition of anonymity said that President Bush planned to nameAssistant Treasury Secretary David W. Mullins Jr. to a vacancy onthe Federal Reserve board. Economists said the appointment waslikely to give the administration, which has sought a loosermonetary policy, a greater voice in the Fed's decisions.   Although the GNP revision Wednesday was in line with economists'expectations, it still caused a negative ripple in financialmarkets because traders interpreted it as a sign the Fed will feelless pressure to lower rates immediately.   Most of the revision was attributed to a better-than-anticipatedtrade performance. The September trade deficit, which hit afive-year low, was unavailable when the advance estimate was made.   Exports climbed at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the thirdquarter, compared with an earlier estimate of no change, whileimports grew only 9.5 percent, compared with a 15.1 percent jump inthe initial report.   Consumer spending was also better than first thought, rising ata brisk annual rate of 6.2 percent _ the strongest since the firstquarter of 1988 _ compared with a preliminary estimate of 5.8percent.   Inflation, as measured by a price index tied to the GNP,improved dramatically in the third quarter, climbing at an annualrate of 2.9 percent after a 5.0 percent jump in the April-Junequarter. Those figures were unchanged from the advance estimate.   Analysts generally expect that the third-quarter surge inconsumer spending will not be repeated, attributing much of therise to auto purchases spurred by dealer discounts and financingincentives.   They also are pessimistic about trade, believing that thestrength in the dollar will stall further improvement in thedeficit.   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said after-taxcorporate profits were off a sharp 7.2 percent in the thirdquarter, matching the decline in the second quarter, which was theworst performance in three years. It was the third consecutivequarter that profits have dropped. The department attributed muchof the decline to losses from Hurricane Hugo.</TEXT></DOC>
