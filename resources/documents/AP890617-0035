The Pacific Stars and Stripes, an unofficial U.S. militarynewspaper, quoted Filipino authorities in Angeles City as sayingthey learned of the surveillance through documents captured lastJuly from the communist New People's Army.   According to the report, the rebels watched two U.S. Air Forcecolonels, a lieutenant colonel, four captains, and two sergeantsassigned to the base in Angeles City.   The newspaper quoted police Maj. Efren Alamares as saying thenine were apparently targeted because they lived off post.   Efforts to contact police in Angeles City were unsuccesfulbecause telephone lines there were out of order.   Philippine rebels have sometimes attacked Americans in the past.   Last April, they killed U.S. Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe as hedrove to work at the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group in theManila suburb of Quezon City.   In October 1987, rebels killed three Americans and a Filipinocivilian in coordinated ambushes outside Clark.   The rebels have repeatedly threatened attacks on U.S. personnelbecause of Washington's support of President Corazon Aquino'scounterinsurgency campaign.   Capt. Donna Eggelston, Clark spokeswoman, said the Air Force``periodically receives intelligence reports on terrorist activity.   ``The report in question concerns information received in 1988,''she said. ``Due to the sensitive nature of these reports, we do notcomment on them, and we do this to protect individuals who may beinvolved.''   She refused to say whether the nine personnel are still assignedto Clark or to describe their duties.   About 40,000 American troops, civilians and military dependentsare stationed at six U.S. military installations in the Philippines.   More than half are stationed at Clark in central Luzon, the mainPhilippine island. Rebels are strong in the area.   The New People's Army has been waging a 20-year insurgency toestablish a Marxist state.</TEXT></DOC>
