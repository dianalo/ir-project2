Henoted the charges were announced the day before federal income taxreturns are due.   The Helmsleys were joined in pleading innocent to the statecharges by Frank Turco, 45, of Lutz, Fla., Mrs. Helmsley's formertop aide, and Joseph Licari, 51, of Oyster Bay Cove, the couple'sformer financial manager.   Both also were named in the federal indictment, which containedsimilar charges. That indictment also accused Mrs. Helmsley andTurco of extortion conspiracy; they allegedly received kickbacks bythreatening suppliers with a cutoff of Helmsley business and bythreatening Helmsley employees with loss of their jobs.   The Helmsleys, whose holdings include the Empire State Buildingand the Helmsley Palace Hotel, are estimated to be worth at least$1.4 billion.   According to the indictments, the Helmsleys spent approximately$4 million to refurbish the mansion with an enclosure for one ofthe estate's two pools; a breakfast room and marble dance floor onthe roof of that enclosure; an elaborate indoor-outdoor stereosystem; more than $370,000 in landscaping; and an assortment offurniture and paintings.   In addition, a $45,000 birthday present for Helmsley _ a clockin the shape of the Helmsley Building on Park Avenue _ was billedto and paid by the Park Lane Hotel in December 1984, it said. Andfour jade art objects worth $500,000 were paid for by four New YorkCity hotels as furniture purchases in 1984, the charges said.   Prior to their arraignment, the Helmsleys were booked andfingerprinted at Police Headquarters ``like anybody else. Theyreceived no special treatment whatsoever,'' said state AttorneyGeneral Robert Abrams, who announced the state indictment.   Later, in court, the Helmsleys sat quietly in the front row asalleged drug dealers and thieves were arraigned. They spoke fromtime to time. Helmsley, 79, wore a brown suit and cashmere coat.Mrs. Helmsley, 67, in a long red coat-dress with a blue collar,appeared depressed; her mascara had run.   State prosecutors requested $1 million bail each for theHelmsleys, with $100,000 bail for their aides. But acting stateSupreme Court Justice Carol Berkman released them on their ownrecognizance pending a June 1 court date.   All four are due in U.S. District Court on April 21 forarraignment on the federal charges.   The state indictment against each defendant included 139 countsof falsifying business records; 44 counts of offering a falseinstrument for filing; three counts of scheme to defraud; one countof conspiracy; and one misdemeanor count of scheme to defraud.   The indictment said the crimes were committed between 1982 and1986.   The charges in the federal indictment include conspiracy, incometax evasion, filing false and fraudulent income tax returns, mailfraud and, for Mrs. Helmsley and Turco, conspiracy to commitextortion.   The maximum fine and prison term on conviction of the charges isunclear. Each state felony count carries with it up to four yearsin prison and a $500,000 fine; the federal counts carry sentencesof up to five years in prison and fines of up to $250,000.   The extortion conspiracy count, however, can bring up to 20years in prison and a $250,000 fine.   Mrs. Helmsley, who is prominent in ads for a string of hotels,recently turned down a deal from prosecutors, who said they wouldnot seek the indictment of her ailing husband if she pleaded guiltyto fraud, a source has said.   Giuliani, at the news conference, also congratulated the NewYork Post for its investigative reporting involving the Helmsleys'finances. The Post, over the last 15 months, ran a series ofarticles about the couple.   As many as 30 past and current employees of the Helmsleyorganization reportedly were given immunity from prosecution inreturn for testimony before state and federal grand juries;Giuliani refused to comment on that.</TEXT></DOC>
