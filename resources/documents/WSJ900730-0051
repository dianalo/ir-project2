Under pressure from their heads of state -- includingPresident Saddam Hussein of Iraq, who wanted a 40% jump --the oil ministers approved a $3 increase to $21 a barrel inOPEC's &quot;minimum reference price&quot; for a basket of sevencrudes. Iraq was pushing for a $7 rise.</LP><TEXT>   Effective immediately, the increase is the first in almostfour years from an $18 reference price. The figure isn't aset selling price; instead, it is a goal OPEC hopes toachieve in the open market through self-imposed productioncontrols.   Right now, the market price of OPEC oil is a bit under theold reference price, averaging around $17.50 a barrel. It hadfallen as low as $14, or $4 under the old target, earlierthis year.   Still, said Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, &quot;Wedo not foresee that the price will not get to the minimumlevel.&quot; OPEC has seen its average price hit or exceed itstarget at times in the past, but has been unable to keep itthere because quota &quot;cheating&quot; by some members created excesssupply.   This time the ministers believe that price-eroding excessproduction won't occur. They agreed here, as expected, toraise OPEC's production ceiling by 400,000 barrels a day to22.5 million. While higher, the new ceiling, if realized andsustained, would represent a cut in the actual amount of OPECoil entering the market. The ceiling was raised to allow abigger production quota for the United Arab Emirates, whichuntil now has been a chronic over-producer. In return, theUAE has said it will honor its new quota as part of thegroup's bid to push prices to $21.   Thus, OPEC hopes to underwrite its reference-priceincrease of $3 a barrel by taking as much as 700,000 barrelsa day out of glutted world oil markets.   The cuts would come from Kuwait, another of OPEC's leadingover-producers, as well as from the UAE. The two were chieftargets of Iraq's President Hussein, who blamed them for thisyear's oil-price fall and threatened to use military force tostop their quota &quot;cheating.&quot; Only a week ago, on the eve ofOPEC's meeting, President Hussein moved troops and tanks tothe 100-mile border Iraq shares with Kuwait.   Formerly known for aggressiveness in OPEC affairs, Kuwaitwas noticeably conciliatory at the meeting here and isunderstood to be cutting output. The UAE also is arranging toreduce production to its new quota of 1.5 million barrels aday from two million barrels.   Many considered the session here crucial for OPEC andseveral suggested OPEC is on a new course. &quot;This is theturning point,&quot; Jibril Aminu, Nigeria's oil minister, said inan interview during the weekend. &quot;The credibility of OPEC ison the threshold of being restored.&quot; Ministers cited a newarrangement to monitor quota violations and a mechanismintended to adjust prices and production in tandem in futuresix-month periods.   This was also OPEC's shortest regular conference in sixyears. The 13 ministers took only three days of informal andformal talks to settle on a new price target, output ceilingand a formula linking future price and production changes.The new reference price and output ceiling are in effectuntil year end.   Most delegates maintained that their focus here was on theeconomics of oil, not politics. Some privately complainedabout Iraq's &quot;gunboat diplomacy&quot; with Kuwait and the UAE, butthe majority seemed convinced that President Hussein had madean offer they couldn't refuse. &quot;He was the catalyst in thisagreement,&quot; said one senior OPEC source.   While Iraq appears to have succeeded in getting pledges ofquota compliance, it didn't get the much-higher referenceprice it wanted. Only Libya openly supported Iraq's bid for$25 a barrel. A majority, including Saudi Arabia andVenezuela, considered that unrealistic and favored $20.Nigeria suggested $22.   Iraq regards the final $21 figure, &quot;a step forward inimproving the prices,&quot; its oil minister, Issam Abdul RaheemAl-Chalabi, said in an interview. &quot;This was, in fact,engineered by Saudi Arabia and Iraq with consultation withothers,&quot; he said.   Iran initially proposed a $20 reference price, and forweeks before this meeting, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oilminister, promoted that idea in visits to other OPECcountries. &quot;I felt the market would accept&quot; a $2 rise in oilprices, he said in an interview. From now on, OPEC hopes tomake that judgment process routine by linking any futureincreases in its production ceiling with increases in itsreference price. The aim is to assure progressive, gradualrises in prices. &quot;We don't want price shocks,&quot; he said.   Besides Iran and Iraq, Saudi Arabia played a leading rolein the new agreement. The new output ceiling and some othermatters were worked out as long ago as July 10 at a meetingin Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, attended by Mr. Nazer and the oilministers of Kuwait, the UAE, Iraq and Qatar. It was followedby a telephone call from Saudi King Fahd to the ruler of theUAE, which then announced it would accept a new OPEC quota.On Friday, Mr. Nazer listed as among the agreement's &quot;veryimportant elements&quot; the fact that it is &quot;based on the fullpolitical commitment at the highest level by membercountries.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
