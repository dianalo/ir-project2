The hilltop site of the 27-year-old hotel was ownedby the noble Okura family, which had run one of the big pre-warindustrial combines called zaibatsu.   The 888-room hotel, across the street from the U.S. Embassy andambassador's residence, just finished a three-year refurbishmentlast September. The management says the U.S. delegation is takingabout 400 of the Okura's rooms, and 13 other foreign delegations tothe funeral of Emperor Hirohito also will be housed there.</TEXT><NOTE>Akasaka Palace</NOTE><TEXT>   The palace, where Hirohito spent part of his young manhood andearly married life before he ascended the throne in 1926, wascompleted in 1909 to be the crown prince's residence, and was such agrand building that the Meiji Emperor (1868-1912) was said to beunwilling to visit it.   Modeled on the palace at Versailles and the Louvre, AkasakaPalace is a grand example of architecture in the late Meiji periodwhen Japan, then emerging in a rush from feudal isolation, wastrying to outdo the West. Most of the building materials andfurnishings were imported.   The palace, which sits in its own large park, was restored in the1970s and now is used as a guesthouse for foreign dignitaries and tohold major conferences, such as the 1986 economic summit. PrimeMinister Noboru Takeshita will host a reception there following theHirohito funeral.</TEXT><NOTE>The Imperial Palace</NOTE><TEXT>   The main ceremonial building within the moated, 284-acre palacegrounds in the center of Tokyo, the Imperial Palace was built in1968 to replace a structure lost in a World War II firestorm causedby U.S. bombing.   The palace grounds include ponds, moats and forests as well asadministrative buildings and the Fukiage Mansion where Hirohitolived through his final illness.   The moats, walls and some structures date from the 17th century,when the whole complex was called Edo Castle, the fortifiedheadquarters of the Tokugawa Shogunate that then ruled Japan fromEdo, the old name of Tokyo.</TEXT><NOTE>Shinjuku Imperial Gardens</NOTE><TEXT>   The site of the Hirohito funeral services, the park once servedas the garden for the imperial household. In mid-April, it becomesone of the favorite places in Tokyo for people to picnic under whatseem to be clouds of cherry blossoms.   A sanctuary has been constructed for the funeral, as well as twotents 482 feet long to shelter 10,000 Japanese and foreigndignitaries from the February weather.</TEXT><NOTE>BEIJING</NOTE><NOTE>Great Hall</NOTE><TEXT>   This cavernous, Soviet-style hall of beige-colored stone wasbuilt in less than a year for the celebration of the communistgovernment's 10-year anniversary in 1959. It sits on the west sideof Beijing's broad Tienanmen Square in the traditional heart of thecity, and is the site for all major gatherings, including CommunistParty conferences and legislative sessions.   Bush, like other state visitors, will come here for his officialred-carpet greeting, including cannon volleys and gifts of flowersfrom small children who jump up and down and shout in sing-song,``Warm welcome.''   The president also will be toasted by China's top leaders at aGreat Hall banquet. The central banquet hall, with a two-story-highceiling, can sit 5,000 people and often does. But it is a long wayfrom the basement kitchen, and food often arrives cold.</TEXT><NOTE>Zhongnanhai</NOTE><TEXT>   Meaning ``the Central and South Seas,'' Zhongnanhai is a 213-acrecompound embracing two large lakes that used to be part of theimperial palace grounds. It now serves as Communist Partyheadquarters, and many visiting leaders, including Bush, are takenbehind its well-guarded vermillion walls to meet with party GeneralSecretary Zhao Ziyang.   In the past, many top leaders also lived in Zhongnanhai, althoughthe current leaders are believed to live most of the time in theirown homes. A small portion of Zhongnanhai is open to Chinesetourists as a park, but remains closed to foreigners.</TEXT><NOTE>Chongwenmen Christian Church</NOTE><TEXT>   Bush is expected to attend services at this Protestant churchhidden behind high stone walls along a narrow hutong, or alley. Thestone church built by missionaries with a round, dark-wood vaultedceiling usually is filled to capacity on Sundays with about 1,500people, making it one of the largest of Beijing's six Protestantchurches.   It was being used as a factory when Bush lived in Beijing as theU.S. envoy. Like all other churches and temples, its religousfunctions were halted during the radical leftist Cultural Revolutionof 1966-76, when religion was banned. It reopened as a church in1983.   During the ban on religion, however, the pastor, the Rev. KanXueqing, was ordered by the government to hold Sunday services forthe small foreign community. The Bushes attended, and in 1975 Kanbaptized their daughter, Dorothy, then 16.</TEXT><NOTE>Diaoyutai State Guesthouse</NOTE><TEXT>   Chinese antiques, a king-sized bed, gold-plated plumbing and anelectric massage chair are among the accommodations awaiting Bush inthis elegant, high-security government hotel.   Diaoyutai, ``the fishing terrace'' covering 100 acres of park,served as a retreat for emperors more than 800 years ago. Thecommunist government built guest villas there in 1959 to accommodatethe many foreign leaders visiting on the 10th anniversary of thecommunist takeover.</TEXT><NOTE>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA</NOTE><NOTE>The Blue House</NOTE><TEXT>   The house and its auxiliary facilities have been used as thenation's presidential residence since the first Republic of Koreawas formed in 1948, and is now the home of President Roh Tae-woo.   Built in 1927 by Japanese colonial rulers, the big two-storygranite structure derives its name from its tiled roofs, which arepainted blue. It is on a mountainside north of the city center, nearthe remaining royal palaces of the Chosun Dynasty kings, who ruledKorea for five centuries. The U.S. military administration used theBlue House as its headquarters for three years after Korea wasdivided in 1945.</TEXT><NOTE>The National Assembly</NOTE><TEXT>   The National Assembly building, home of South Korea's unicamerallegislative body, is a domed six-story structure surrounded bygranite columns said to symbolize the harmony of diverse opinions ofthe Korean people.   The assembly building was constructed in 1975 on an island in theHan River, which runs through the capital city. Bush made a speechat the National Assembly during his visit in April 1982 as vicepresident.</TEXT><NOTE>Yongsan garrison</NOTE><TEXT>   The garrison is headquarters for the Combined Forces Command, theU.S. Forces Korea, the U.S. 8th Army and the United Nations Command,and serves as operational control center for the 42,000 U.S. troopsstationed in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.
