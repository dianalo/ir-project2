Harcourt is the target of a previously reported $44-a-share, or $1.73 billion, offer from British Printing andamp; Communications Inc., which is controlled by Robert Maxwell. Harcourt stock, which soared $16.125 a share after the announcement Monday and rose another $1.375 Tuesday to $48, fell $1 on Wednesday and closed yesterday at $45.75, down $1.25, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Volume totaled more than 1.9 million shares, making Harcourt the fourth-most active issue.    Harcourt's feisty chairman and chief executive officer, William Jovanovich, has retained First Boston Corp. to help prepare a defense against Mr. Maxwell, but Harcourt isn't understood to be actively shopping itself to potential buyers. Yet Wall Street sources said they expect increasing pressure will be put on Harcourt to boost its stock price. Sources said that before the company talks with Mr. Maxwell, its investment bankers may first attempt to explore the possibility of a stock buyback or to find a friendly buyer.    Meanwhile, Harcourt plowed ahead with a meeting of shareholders scheduled for this morning, defying both Mr. Maxwell and some of Harcourt's own institutional holders. Harcourt had called the meeting on May 4 -- before Mr. Maxwell's bid -- to seek approval for doubling its authorized common shares to 100 million, needed to proceed with a planned public offering of 8.6 million common shares. It currently has about 39.4 million shares outstanding.    Mr. Maxwell said yesterday in an interview that he hasn't received a response to his request to meet with Mr. Jovanovich to discuss &quot;all matters, including price,&quot; in his bid. He added that he doesn't plan at present to make a hostile tender offer for Harcourt. But Mr. Maxwell said he might consider sweetening his bid if his advisers or Harcourt convince him that the company is worth more than $44 a share, or if a higher competing bid emerges.    But some Wall Street publishing specialists and industry executives questioned whether another bid will be made, at least from another major publishing company. A number of publishing concerns that had been thought to be potential rival bidders or friendly suitors for Harcourt have made it clear they aren't interested -- at least not in the whole company. A spokesman for McGraw-Hill Inc., which had been rumored to be a primary candidate, said yesterday, &quot;We are not interested in Harcourt Brace and won't be a white knight.&quot;    Gulf andamp; Western Inc. and Time Inc. both declined to comment on reports they might bid for Harcourt, but executives at both companies said privately that they weren't interested in acquiring Harcourt, though they might be interested in picking off pieces, should assets be put up for sale.    Mr. Maxwell said he had been assured by News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch that he wouldn't be a rival bidder. Mr. Murdoch couldn't be reached for comment, but Martin Singerman, who heads News Corp.'s publishing operations, said that &quot;as far as we know, there is nothing going on here and no interest in Harcourt&quot; at present. News Corp. recently purchased Harper andamp; Row Inc. for about $200 million.    Though Mr. Jovanovich owns a scant 1% of Harcourt's stock, his mercurial manner is viewed as a roadblock to most other publishers. One Wall Street executive familiar with Mr. Jovanovich said that finding a friendly buyer will be difficult. &quot;Another publishing company will want to move the operation to New York and Mr. Jovanovich isn't going to allow that,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;Jovanovich can be a difficult fellow to deal with. There aren't going to be a lot of takers.&quot;    A top publishing attorney, who asked not to be identified, said that &quot;if there's an overbid, it could come from a surprising direction outside the publishing industry,&quot; such as a company &quot;interested in education or amusement parks.&quot; He added that Harcourt might be a good fit for Walt Disney Co. or MCA Inc., both of which have media and entertainment interests and operate theme park attractions. Harcourt is a leading educational publisher and owns Sea World marine parks. A Disney spokesman said he &quot;couldn't speculate on what has been a rumor&quot; that Disney might be interested in acquiring Harcourt. He said Harcourt is &quot;considered a good competitor&quot; to Walt Disney World in Orlando through Harcourt's Orlando-based Sea World operation. MCA officials couldn't be reached for comment.    Publishing industry executives also said that another foreign bidder could emerge.    Mr. Maxwell said he wasn't aware of any other bid in the works, but he added, &quot;It's no secret that everyone on the Street . . . is working out what they ought to do about it.&quot;    Charles Harris, a Harcourt lawyer, said the planned stock offering that is the subject of today's holder meeting &quot;was in no way intended as a defense against&quot; a possible suitor. But it would make any takeover much more expensive, and Mr. Maxwell has said he won't pursue his current bid if new shares are issued.    Moreover, some of Harcourt's largest holders are lining up against the stock proposal. At least one institution that owns several hundred thousand shares switched its vote after Mr. Maxwell emerged and now opposes the proposal to increase authorized shares. &quot;Obviously, you don't want another nine million shares floating around out there, making a takeover impossible,&quot; griped one institutional investor. &quot;I can't believe Harcourt hasn't canceled this meeting.&quot;    Despite such opposition, several analysts suggested that Harcourt's intention to hold the meeting signals that the company already has enough proxy votes to win approval of the plan. Harcourt declined to comment on any aspect of its strategy.    Some on Wall Street have speculated that Harcourt may attempt a recapitalization or a leveraged buyout. But in Harcourt's 1985 annual report, Mr. Jovanovich said the company &quot;will never engage in a leveraged buyout of the company designed to include its own management among the new private owners.&quot; He has previously described such buyouts as &quot;despicable.&quot; In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    ---   Charles F. McCoy in Miami contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
