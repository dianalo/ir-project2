The charge stems from a recent arbitration decision involving its Canadian subsidiary, Commonwealth Insurance Co. The decision relates to Commonwealth's dispute with American Centennial Insurance Co., Peapack, N.J., over certain reinsurance agreements from 1977 to 1983. Home Group said the reserve will provide &quot;for known and potential future liabilities in this and other cases.&quot;    For the year-earlier second quarter, Home Group, a New York financial services and insurance holding company, posted net income of $47.7 million, or $1.31 a share, on revenue of $588.1 million.    Home Group shares closed Friday at $13.50, up 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
