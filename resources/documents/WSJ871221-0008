The jury held Detroit-based Ford liable not only for installing defectively designed rear lap belts, but also for failing to install rear-seat shoulder belts, said Harold A. Sakayan, the lawyer for the injured boy's family. The verdict is one of the largest ever in a case involving seat belt design, Mr. Sakayan said.    Ford has denied that its seat belts are defective, and said it will appeal the award.    The boy, James Garrett, was injured in 1985 when the Ford Escort he was riding in collided with a dump truck. The boy was buckled into the rear lap seat belt, and suffered spinal injuries when he was whipped forward by the impact, Mr. Sakayan said. Another child buckled into the Escort's back seat was killed when the belt severed an artery in his stomach, he said.    The verdict comes at a time when consumer groups and the National Transportation Safety Board are pushing for federal action to require rear-seat shoulder belts. Auto makers have resisted installing them.    &quot;The jury found that manufacturers have got to do more than the minimum standards,&quot; said Robert Dewey of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Auto Safety. </TEXT></DOC>
