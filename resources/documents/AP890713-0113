The early presentation provided ``further evidence of ... ourdesire to achieve early results,'' Michael Edes, the head of theBritish delegation speaking on behalf of NATO, told a newsconference.   Presenting the proposal today instead of in September, asoriginally planned, gives the Warsaw Pact time to frame a responseduring an eight-week recess in the talks. Negotiations broke todayand resume Sept. 7.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III outlined details of theNATO proposal Wednesday. He said NATO was recommending a ceiling of5,700 combat aircraft and 1,900 combat helicopters for eachalliance. The inclusion of an aircraft cutback complied with along-standing East bloc demand.   According to NATO data, the Warsaw Pact countries have about9,600 combat aircraft versus about 6,700 NATO aircraft.   The Western proposal is based on a blueprint for deep reductionsin conventional arms and troops in Europe first unveiled byPresident Bush at an alliance summit in May and subsequentlyendorsed by NATO members.   Bush called for military cutbacks that would fix the same ceilingof 275,000 troops in Europe for each superpower. According to NATOstatistics, that would require the United States to remove 30,000troops from Europe while the Soviets would have to pull out morethan 10 times that, or 325,000.   The proposal also foresees deep cuts in armaments, with aproposed ceiling of 20,000 tanks for each side and reductions incombat aircraft and artillery.   The decision to make the proposal was reached by a panel ofsenior North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials in Brussels onFriday, a U.S. official in Budapest said.   It complied with East bloc appeals that the presentation bespeeded up.   The head of the Soviet delegation, Oleg A. Grinevsky, welcomedthe NATO proposal but said he was ``sorry'' it did not go further.   ``At first glance the proposal tabled by NATO today has no newelements,'' Grinevsky, said in a news conference.   ``Rather it is a more detailed elaboration of the positions thatwere stated in Brussels, and only in respect of aviation andhelicopters at that,'' Grinevsky said.   At a meeting in Bucharest, Romania, last weekend, leaders of theSoviet-led Warsaw Pact praised Bush's NATO proposal and said aninitial accord on reductions could be reached as early as next year.   However, the East bloc summit did not produce any new concreteproposals on arms control of its own.   The Bush proposal called for reaching agreement in six months toa year, and for reductions to be carried out by 1992 or 1993.   In a statement issued at the end of the two-day Bucharest summit,the Warsaw Pact said, ``The situation of the negotiations is suchthat the first understandings may be achieved already in 1990.''   Last week, the head of the Polish delegation to the Vienna talkscalled on NATO to submit the proposal before the recess rather thanwaiting until the third round of talks opens in the fall.   The Soviet military bloc has a proposal on the table to reducesix kinds of weapons 10 percent to 15 percent below present levelsby 1994, then add a further 25 percent reduction by 1997 beforemoving to purely defensive forces in the year 2000.   The Soviet Union has also begun unilateral troop withdrawals fromEastern Europe that are to reduce the number of Soviet troops in theregion by 50,000 by 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
