Background</ITAG>The Peer Review Improvement Act of 1982 (Title I, Subtitle C of the TaxEquity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, Pub. L. 97-248) (TEFRA) establishedthe Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization (PRO) program.TEFRA requires the Secretary to enter into contracts with private PeerReview Organizations (PROs) for the review of services furnished underMedicare. In the past, these contracts have been subject to renewal ona biennial basis. The specific review obligations of PROs are outlined in a document knownas the Scope of Work, which defines the duties and functions of Medicarereview performed by the PRO. Such duties and functions include the implementationand operation of a review system to assure the quality of services forwhich payment may be made, in whole or in part, under Title XVIII of theSocial Security Act, and to eliminate unreasonable, unnecessary, and inappropriatecare provided to Medicare beneficiaries. The first Scope of Work coveredthe 1984-1986 contract period. On November 12, 1985 (50 FR 46702), we publisheda notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> which announced the availability of the proposedsecond Scope of Work and solicited comments on its content. We subsequentlyconsidered the comments and incorporated them into the final second Scopeof Work. The second Scope of Work was effective for the 1986-1988 contractperiod. On September 12, 1988, we published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 35234) which identified the requirementsof the third Scope of Work for all States except Maryland; the Virgin Islands;and Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territoryof the Pacific Islands. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Implementation of Recent Legislation </ITAG>Section 4091(a) of Pub. L. 100-203, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Actof 1987 (OBRA 87), allows a one-time contract extension (of up to 24 months)for existing contracts in order to permit the Secretary to more effectivelyadminister PRO contract renewals and changes the PRO contract period fromtwo to three years. Accordingly, we have developed a schedule for extendingthe current contracts and an implementation schedule for the third Scopeof Work for the new three-year contract period. Hence, on October 1, 1988,approximately one-fourth of the PRO's began a new 3-year contract periodunder which they must implement the third Scope of Work. The remainingPROs will implement the third Scope of Work on April 1, 1989 (some throughnew contracts and others through extensions and modifications to theirexisting contracts). Section 4091(b) of OBRA 87 requires that we publish, 30 days prior to theeffective date, any new policy or procedure adopted by the Secretary whichsubstantially affects the performance of contract obligations under PROcontracts. Therefore, we are publishing this notice to inform the publicthat the Third Scope of Work contains some new requirements that substantiallyimpact on PRO contract obligations for Maryland; New Jersey; and the VirginIslands.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Third Scope of Work</ITAG>The third Scope of Work, for all geographical areas, was developed followingan extensive analysis of the review requirements of the second Scope ofWork. In addition, the third Scope of Work incorporates the provisionsof three public laws which impact on PRO review that were passed afterthe development of the second Scope of Work. These laws are: Pub. L. 99-272,the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA); Pub.L. 99-509, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA 86); andOBRA 87. Relevant provisions of these laws are discussed in section IVof this notice.In the September 12, 1988 (53 FR 35234), <T4>Federal Register</T4> we indicated that the requirements of the Scopeof Work applicable to the PRO areas of Guam/American Samoa/Northern MarianaIslands/Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands might be changed. We, however,are not making changes at this time; hence the PROs in this area will continueto perform review following the requirements of the second Scope of Work.Until recently, New Jersey received a waiver from Medicare's prospectivepayment system (PPS). All acute hospital care in New Jersey was under theState's cost control system, a DRG-based system, and accordingly, the NewJersey PRO contracted under a Scope of Work developed specifically to meetthe state's review needs. Effective January 1, 1989, New Jersey convertedits Medicare reimbursement program to PPS and, thus, the PRO will now performPPS-based review outlined in the September 12, 1988, (53 FR 35324), <T4>Federal Register.</T4>The provisions of the third Scope of Work are effective in Maryland andthe Virgin Islands on April 1, 1989. Both Maryland and the Virgin Islandsare exempt from Medicare's Prospective Payment System. In Maryland, allacute care hospitals and non-State-owned specialty hospitals are subjectto regulatory rate review by an independent State agency, the Health ServiceCost Review Commission. The Commission reviews all proposed service charges(based on costs) and, where a proposed rate is not appropriate, changesthe rate. The Maryland system and Medicare's PPS provide essentially thesame incentives to hospitals. The purpose of Maryland's cost control systemis to change hospital behavior through financial incentives which encourageefficient medical care management by doctors and hospitals.An individual or organization interested in obtaining copies of the secondand third Scopes of Work for any of these PRO areas should specify thePRO area Scope he or she wishes to receive and address requests to: HealthCare Financing Administration, Attention: Bob Lozosky, Office of Budgetand Administration, Room 322A East High Rise Building, 6325 Security Boulevard,Baltimore, Maryland 21207.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Program Changes and Legal/Administrative Requirements</ITAG>In an effort to achieve consistency and be least disruptive to on-goingreview activities, we attempted to change review activities in the Marylandand Virgin Islands Scopes of Work only where absolutely warranted. Thus,much of the consent of the second Scope of Work remains a part of the Scopesof Work for these areas. Where changes were made, they were done in theinterest of creating a more effective review system and making more efficientuse of PRO resources. In some cases, the third Scope of Work in Maryland,and the modified second Scope of Work in the Virgin Islands, contain certaintypes of review required by legislation. To the extent that we have flexibility,we are amending the review requirements in the interest of increasing PROeffectiveness and efficiency. Some existing requirements which have proveninefficient or ineffective are being deleted.We have, in an effort to achieve consistency among PROs, developed a basicquality intervention plan (QIP). This plan is a prescribed blueprint whichrequires each PRO to implement specific interventions in response to confirmedquality problems. The QIP mandates a three level severity indexing systemto be used in categorizing quality problems. It also requires the PRO tofollow a specific process, along with timeframes, for notifying the involvedphysician and/or provider. This process provides these parties with anopportunity to discuss the problem. The QIP dicatates what profiling andweighting of quality problems must occur to determine the prescribed qualityintervention.We have modified the HCFA quality screens which PROs use. These screenswere made more explicit in response to comments and ongoing data analysis,so that ``false positives'' were significantly reduced. Sections V and VI contain summaries of the differences and similaritiesbetween the second and third Scope of Work applicable in Maryland and,the second modified second Scope of Work in the Virgin Islands. The reviewrequirements are grouped according to whether they are: (1) Continuingrequirements; (2) new requirements; (3) requirements which continue withsome amendments; or (4) requirements which have been deleted.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Specific Review Requirements in Maryland</ITAG>A. Continuing Requirements_The PRO must andbullet; On every case selected, review for quality of care (e.g., UsingHCFA generic quality of screens), appropriateness of discharge, lengthof stay, medical necessity, appropriateness of setting and make limitationof liability (i.e., waiver of liability) and coverage determinations. andbullet; Review the following hospital cases without a change in levelof effort from the second Scope of Work: <ITAG tagnum="15">  + Noncovered Admissions which are followed by a period in whichthe level of care is covered, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">  + HCFA Regional Office and FI Referrals. </ITAG>andbullet; Review freestanding cardiac catheterization facilities, when requested.andbullet; Upon request, reconsider initial determinations and review DRGchanges. When an appeal (i.e., hearing) is required, the PRO will preparethe appeals folder. andbullet; When appropriate, initiate sanction recommendations against practitionersand providers. andbullet; Maintain at least one non-physician consumer member on the PRO'sgoverning board. andbullet; Investigate beneficiary complaints about the quality of care.andbullet; Review, upon request, hospital emergency room records to determineif the hospital has complied with the requirement to serve all individualsin need of emergency care (Anti-Dumping). andbullet; Offer the attending physician and provider at least 20 days todiscuss the proposed denial or DRG change.   andbullet; For cases selected for review, review each day for which paymentwas made or billed to determine that each day of inpatient care was necessaryand appropriate.  andbullet; Review all cases with certain principal diagnoses identified bythe Medicare Code Editor. In addition, in accordance with the Health Maintenance Organization/CompetitiveMedical Plan (HMO/CMP) Scope of Work, the review of inpatient and ambulatorycare provided to a sample of all Medicare beneficiaries who have enrolledin a risk-based HMO/CMP will continue. Cases which are reviewed are: andbullet; A random sample of hospital discharge; andbullet; Sample of hospital readmissions within 31 days; andbullet; Sample of non-trauma death; andbullet; All transfers from a hospital with which the HMO does not havean agreement to one with which the HMO has an agreement; andbullet; A sample of hospital discharges for 13 identified conditions (including,based upon the identified condition, post and/or prehospital care); and andbullet; Random sample of enrollees receiving ambulatory care.B. New Requirements_The PRO must andbullet; Conduct a significant amount of review onsite in at least 20 percentof the rural hospitals as required by section 4090(b) of OBRA 87. andbullet; Determine in cases selected for review if an invasive procedurewas reasonable and medically necessary. (Originated because of concernthat unnecesary procedures might be performed.) andbullet; Develop a quality intervention plan which meets HDFA requirements.(Originated with intention that quality problems be handled with more consistencyacross the 54 PRO areas.) andbullet; Conduct a review of ambulatory surgery procedures as requiredby section 9343(d) of OBRA 1986. andbullet; Use (to the extent possible) a physician reviewer who is trainedin psychiatry or physical rehabilitation as required by section 4904(c)(2)of OBRA 1987, when a psychiatric or physical rehabilitation case is reviewed.andbullet; Publish (not less than annually) a report that describes the PRO'sfinding with respect to the types of cases in which the PRO has frequentlydetermined that care or services were necessary, inappropriate, renderedin an inappropriate setting, or did not meet professionally recognizedstandards. The findings are to be distributed to providers and practitionerswhose services are subject to review. (This requirement is mandated bysection 4094(c)(1) of OBRA 1987.) andbullet; Review, as required by section 9352 of OBRA 86, post-hospitalintervening care (e.g., home health agency, skilled nursing facility),for which Medicare payment could be made, that is delivered between 2 hospitalreadmissions where the second admission is within 31 days of the dischargefrom the first admission.andbullet; Conduct intensified reviews of those physicians, providers, orDRGs found to exhibit a pattern of substandard care. As part of the QIP,implement specific interventions to rectify identified patterns of substandardcare.In addition, if the PRO negotiates with the Office of Civilian Health andMedical Programs of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), the PRO may reviewinpatient care provided to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. The review is basicallythe same as Medicare's PPS review and it is estimated that it will consistof approximately 17% of CHAMPUS inpatient cases.C. Continuing Requirements with Some Amendmentandbullet; The PRO must continue to select a random sample of dischargesfor review; however, the sample size has been decreased from 6 percentto 3 percent.andbullet; Conduct coding validation for those cases selected in the 3 percentrandom sample.andbullet; The PRO must continue to propose objectives to HCFA in order toresolve identified utilization and quality problems (i.e., a dynamic process).Objectives are based on confirmed quality problems identified through applicationof generic quality screens. Objectives may be statewide or focused by physician,provider, DRG, etc.andbullet; Preadmission/Preprocedure Review_Increased from 5 to 10 procedures,and can extend to outpatient procedures as well. The mandatory review ofpacemaker implants has been changed to a mandatory cataract surgery andcarotid endarterectomy review. Therefore, the PRO will choose 8 additionalprocedures from the following 11 (listed below) or produce evidence whya procedure not on the list should be subjected to 100 percent preadmissionreview: cholecystectomy, major joint replacement, coronary artery bypasswith graft, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, laminectomy,complex peripheral revascularization, hysterectomy, bunionectomy, inguinalhernia repair, prostatectomy, pacemaker insertion.

Additionally,the PRO will review requests for use of an assistant when an intraocularlens will be implanted after the cataract surgery has been performed. Thisis required by section 411 of Pub. L. 101-360, the Medicare CatastrophicCoverage Act of 1988, which amended section 1862(a)(15) of the Act.andbullet; Sample the following review categories with new levels of effort:<ITAG tagnum="15">  + Readmissions-Reduced from 100 percent of all related readmissionswithin 15 days of discharge to 25 percent of all readmissions occurringwithin 31 days from discharge from a hospital.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">  + Focused DRG Review-Seven low volume DRGs related to newborns mustbe reviewed at 100 percent level of effort, while the requirement to reviewDRG 462 (Rehabilitation) has been deleted.
