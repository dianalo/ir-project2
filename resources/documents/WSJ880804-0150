Kuwait originally argued that it needs the $1.9 billion arms package, which got a green light in Congress this week, to protect itself from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Iran. But now officials in the tiny, oil-rich kingdom contend that the arms ultimately may be needed to deter the ambitions of Iraq, whom Kuwait supports in the Persian Gulf war.    Iraq has never given up its claims to Kuwaiti territory. It threatened to invade Kuwait on its independence day in 1961. U.S. military analysts fear Baghdad's threat to Kuwait could resume once peace in the gulf allows Iraq to bring home its warships, which are in safe harbors in Italy, and concentrate its diplomatic and military efforts elsewhere after fending off eight years of Iranian assaults.    &quot;Iraq may re-emerge as a threat to the conservative gulf states,&quot; says Anthony Cordesman of Georgetown University's National Security Studies Program. &quot;You can't predict the future of Iraq.&quot; Mr. Cordesman says Iraq could emerge as a well-armed and confident nation further bolstered in the Persian Gulf region by three guided-missile-equipped frigates, which are among its ships currently secure from Iranian attack in Italy.    The proposed U.S. arms sale to Kuwait includes 40 F-18 fighter aircraft and 300 Maverick air-to-surface missiles. Pro-Israeli congressmen this week decided to allow the sale to proceed after compromises intended to safeguard Israel. They were also chastened somewhat by Saudi Arabia's decision last month to turn to Britain for a $30 billion, 10-year arms deal, after legislative opposition killed similar Saudi purchases from the U.S.    Congress can block an arms sale if both houses disapprove it and then override a presidential veto. Neither house had disapproved the Kuwait sale, although the Senate had voiced opposition to the introduction of Mavericks to the gulf. The compromise clears the way for the sale.    Military analysts believe the arms sale will help safeguard U.S. interests in the gulf once American warships leave. Many of the U.S. vessels would sail home if current efforts to bring an end to the Iran-Iraq war succeed. The sale would tie the U.S. more closely to neutral Kuwait, which enjoys the best relationship of any gulf state with the Soviet Union and has previously balked at being too close to Washington.    Mr. Cordesman says the sale would make Kuwait &quot;the closest thing to {an aircraft} carrier in the gulf in the near future.&quot; Kuwait won't let the American military use its territory in peacetime. But U.S. planes invited during a crisis could make better use of Kuwaiti facilities if they were designed for American equipment. &quot;We are building relations for a contingency we can't predict,&quot; he says.    Still, it was shifting political sands in Washington, not in the Persian Gulf, that allowed the sale to go ahead. Many usually strident pro-Israel congressmen and senators withdrew opposition despite fears that such sales of sophisticated weaponry are escalating the explosiveness of the region and the ultimate threat to Israel.    Yet, after the British sale to Saudi Arabia, many lawmakers believe it may be better for the U.S. to sell the weapons and have more influence over how they are used. Israel also considers Kuwait far less a threat than other Arab states, and it has been pleased by the country's refusal to release Shiite terrorists despite threats. Pro-Israel lobbyists are picking their targets more carefully at a time when national sentiment toward Israel is more negative because of the West Bank crisis.    Rep. Larry Smith (D., Fla.), who prepared a resolution for disapproval of the sale, backed off after a compromise was reached last week involving U.S. Jewish leaders, Congress and President Reagan's national security adviser, Colin Powell.    &quot;You are either a pragmatic politician or a great statesman who gets run over,&quot; said Rep. Smith, complaining that in the wake of the British sale to the Saudis, no one in the Senate proposed a resolution for disapproval to match his effort in the House. &quot;What we've done is shape the sale as much as we could.&quot;    Under the compromise, Kuwait can't extend the range of the F-18s with refueling capability, the aircraft can't be based outside Kuwait and the missiles won't be delivered until all the fighters are operational -- probably not until 1994. Kuwait also had to abandon plans to buy 200 Maverick-D missiles, better suited for use against tanks and artillery, and instead take bigger Maverick-G missiles, which are more useful against ships and fortifications. The change reduces the threat to Israel, some members of Congress reason.    The sale faces one hurdle, but administration officials believe it will be relatively easy to overcome. Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.) proposed amending the foreign appropriations bill to ban the sale of Maverick missiles -- made by General Motors Corp. unit Hughes Aircraft Corp. in his state -- to any Persian Gulf country. He pledges to continue his fight against the spread of high-technology weapons, but administration officials expect the amendment to fail. </TEXT></DOC>
