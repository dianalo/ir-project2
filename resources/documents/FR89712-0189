Blackstone seeks an exemption under 49 U.S.C.10505 from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343 regardingits common control of CNW/CNWT and the carriers it was authorized to controlthrough control of Transtar, Inc., in Finance Docket No. 31363, <T3>Blackstone Capital Partners L.P._Exemption from 49 U.S.C. 10746, 11321,and 11343</T3> (not printed), served December 23, 1988. Blackstone alsoseeks an exemption under section 10505 from applicable provisions of 49U.S.C. 11321 and requests that the Commission make such findings as maybe required to grant that exemption.On June 21, 1989, CNWT and Midwestern Railroad Properties, Inc. (MRPI)filed a notice of exemption for issuance of securities and assumption ofliabilities under 49 CFR Part 1175 and 49 U.S.C. 10505 and 11301.

The notice also covers the issuance ofguarantees, security interests or mortgages by CNWT and/or MRPI in a principalamount of up to $1,060 million. The Commission has stayed the effectivedate of this exemption until July 31, 1989, in a decision served July 5,1989.The Commission requests comments in response to both the petition for exemptionfiled in Finance Docket No. 31493 and the notice of exemption for issuanceof securities filed in Finance Docket 31493 (Sub-No. 1). Although docketedseparately, these two transactions appear interrelated, and we will consolidatethem. The lead case will be Finance Docket No. 31493, and all commentsshould refer to that case number. Comments on the petition should addressthe section 10505 exemption criteria in light of the statutory standardsat section 11344(d) of the Act. Comments on the notice should address whetherpermitting the proposed securities issuance to take effect through exemptionwould be consistent with the provisions of 49 CFR Part 1175, or whetherthe proposed issuance should be considered under the standards of 49 U.S.C.11301. Comments also should indicate whether we should approve the issuanceif considered under 49 U.S.C. 11301.Copies of the petition for exemption can be obtained from Blackstone'srepresentative: Betty Jo Christian or Timothy M. Walsh, Steptoe andamp; Johnson,1330 Connecticut Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20036-1795, (202) 429-3000.Copies of the notice of the securities exemption can be obtained from theCNWT: James P.

If comments we receive on the proceduralschedule convince us that this schedule is inappropriate, we will immediatelyissue a notice establishing a new schedule or postponing the due datesof the existing one. Otherwise, parties should file comments and supportingverified statements in response to the petition and notice no later thanJuly 28, 1989. Applicants may file a reply and rebuttal verified statementsno later than August 4, 1989.In connection with Blackstone's proposed acquisition of control of CNW,Union Pacific Corporation (UPC) will take certain actions. In additionto the planned acquisition of certain trackage rights over CNW lines byUnion Pacific Railroad, UPC will acquire a substantial preferred stockinterest in Chicago and North Western Holdings Corp. At UPC's option, afterfive years this interest would be convertible into common stock representing25 percent of Holding's common stock on a fully-diluted basis. UPC hasindicated it will seek Commission approval, exemption, or declaration thatno approval or exemption is required for the trackage rights and any conversionof preferred to common stock interest after the Commission acts on theBlackstone proposals.We specifically seek comments on whether the Blackstone and UPC proposalscan or should be considered in isolation. The competitive considerationswhich will be the primary focus of either an application or exemption proceedingmay require contemporaneous analysis of all aspects of the CNW takeover.Comments directed to this issue will substantially assist the Commissionin making a determination on this question. Comments must be filed no laterthan July 14, 1989, with a Commission determination on this issue to madeshortly thereafter.An original and ten (10) copies of all comments should be filed with theSecretary of the Commission.
