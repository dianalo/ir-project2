The southern republics have been locked in ethnic violence formore than 19 months, largely over territorial rights to theAzerbaijani enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.   Armenia is seeking control of the area, which is populatedmainly by ethnic Armenians.   Almost all the supplies that come to Armenia from other parts ofthe Soviet Union have to go through Azerbaijan first.   Soviet troops moved into the region last week to break aneconomic blockade that has been strangling Armenia for nearly threemonths, and Nagorno-Karabakh for even longer. About 400 trains with60,000 cars have been reported idled on the tracks in the region.   In the past 24 hours, authorities did manage to push 1,748 railcars of supplies through to Armenia, the official news agency Tasssaid today. But those cars did not carry any oil, and the republicremains strapped for fuel, Tass said, quoting a speech by DeputyPremier Lev Voronin to the Supreme Soviet legislature.   Voronin said transport in Armenia and Azerbaijan is stilldifficult due to ``blown-up bridges and continuing strafing oftrains.''   Much of the cargo that does arrive in Armenia on its main railartery through Azerbaijan has been damaged beyond repair, Pravdareported today.   Factory-built temporary houses for victims of last year'sArmenian earthquake were smashed into piles of metal, broken glassand crushed window frames, it said.   Pre-furnished rooms for the earthquake reconstruction projectarrived with ovens, sinks, pipes and beds ruined, and ``they simplycannot be restored,'' Pravda said.   Tass said it was particularly difficult to restore transport ofsupplies in Nagorno-Karabakh. The regions of Martuninski andGadrutski have been cut off since a bridge was blown up Saturday,the newspaper Red Star said.   It also said weapons were found hidden in sacks of flour on anArmenian helicopter relief flight. The pilot denied any knowledgeof the weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
