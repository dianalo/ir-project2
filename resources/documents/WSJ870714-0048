LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ralston Purina Co. said it signed a definitive agreement to sell its Drake Bakeries Inc. unit in a leveraged buyout led by Drake management.    The food and animal feed concern didn't disclose terms of the pact. But it said the sale will generate a pre-tax gain in the fourth quarter of more than $115 million. Ralston paid about $115 million to acquire the unit from Borden Inc. in July 1986. The company said it expects to complete the sale within 45 days.    In the 1986 fourth quarter, Ralston earned $90.6 million, or $1.18 a share, on sales of $1.6 billion.    Ralston said in April that it was considering the sale of the unit. The move came after a federal court in Philadelphia ruled in an antitrust suit that Ralston had to operate Drake independently of its Continental Baking unit.    The suit was filed by Tasty Baking Co., which claimed the combination would give Ralston control of more than 70% of the snack cake and pie market in New York City. A Ralston spokesman said the company expects the buyout to settle the suit. Tasty Baking, a Philadelphia-based snack food maker, couldn't be reached for comment.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquire a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Ralston closed at $85 a share, up 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
