The later-than-projected restart is due to delays in implementinga department plan to overhaul training, safety, inspection,management and other operations at the plant, the newspaper said,citing government engineers.   Savannah River is the nation's only source of tritium, aradioactive form of hydrogen used in nuclear weapons. The gas decaysrapidly and must be replaced. None has been made since April.   Pentagon experts have said that if Savannah River did not haveall three reactors operating by next summer, extraordinary stepsmight be needed, including deactivating warheads and taking thetritium for higher-priority weapons.   On Tuesday, Energy Secretary John S. Herrington, said one of thethree reactors at the government-operated plant near Aiken, S.C.,would open by spring or summer. The reactors have been closed forsafety reasons.   Robert M. Keller, a senior nuclear engineer at the EnergyDepartment who wrote the overhaul plan, said it may take untilDecember 1989 to restart the first of the reactors, according to theTimes. The newspaper said engineers estimated that it would probablytake until the end of 1990 to restart the others.   C. Anson Franklin, the Energy Department's chief spokesman, saidHerrington last week was not making a firm prediction, only ``aguesstimate that may or may not be validated when all theinformation is in.''   Franklin said a report due to be completed Thursday would outlinethe schedule for putting the plan into effect and offer a firm datefor reopening.</TEXT></DOC>
