Pillsbury Co. says behind-the-counter crews at its Burger King restaurants have to be replaced two to three times a year. Endata Inc., a data-processing company, estimates overall turnover at 40%, with drivers and computer operators the most likely to leave fast. The attrition rate declines sharply, however, the higher one goes up the corporate chain of command. And, at some companies in other industries, most workers seem content just where they are.    Scott Paper Co. says fewer than 5% of its U.S. workers leave each year. Hercules Inc. estimates that 90% of its hires eventually will retire from the company; if any worker strays for greener pastures elsewhere, it's likely to be a computer programmer or systems analyst. At SmithKline Beckman Corp., 91% of the workers at its Philadelphia headquarters indicated in a survey they expect to remain at least five more years.    Poor hires are expensive. SmithKline figures it spends $10,000 on average to recruit and train each worker.    ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS may be losing some pay protection they once had.    Under previous case law, an alien in the U.S., even an illegal one, was entitled to the same minimum-wage rights of the Fair Labor Standards Act as any U.S. citizen. But a federal court judge in Birmingham, Ala., now says the immigration law signed last November has changed all that.    In a case involving an illegal immigrant from India who was working at a Birmingham motel, Judge William Acker Jr. has ruled the new immigration law was intended to eliminate employment as an economic incentive for illegal entry. Extending wage protection to illegals &quot;would effectively repudiate the policy and purposes&quot; of the immigration law, he held. The decision is being appealed.    A SHORTAGE OF COACHES forces some high schools to recruit outsiders.    With fewer gym instructors and other teachers willing to head up athletic programs -- because of the aging teacher population, the long hours and the relatively low pay -- school officials increasingly are looking beyond the classroom to fill coaching assignments. New Rochelle, N.Y., has turned to a Baptist minister and a social worker. In Seattle, Wash., a quarter of the coaches aren't certified teachers.    &quot;If we don't use walk-ons, we'll have to eliminate sports, and that's not acceptable,&quot; says Marty Bledsoe, president of the teacher's union in Grossmont, Calif. But critics contend that students are being shortchanged. &quot;I think coaches are educators first and coaches last,&quot; asserts Joe Murry, Little Rock, Ark., athletic director.    &quot;Most walk-on coaches are here today and gone tomorrow,&quot; says Wayne DeBate of San Diego city schools.    IF GLOBAL TRADE is such a buzzword, a consultant asks, why are so few companies planning their international personnel needs? Michael Tucker of Moran, Stahl andamp; Boyer Inc. complains, for instance, that only 4% of companies it surveyed say that overseas assignments &quot;have a positive effect on career advancement.&quot;    LAWYER, REPRESENT THYSELF: According to a survey by McCabe andamp; Schwartz, a search firm, attorneys with five to eight years' experience in employee benefits can expect to earn up to $90,800 at a consultant, as much as $103,000 at an insurance company and $121,600 in a corporation. But they'll pull in as much as $150,000 working at a large law firm.    HIGH-TECH HIRING posts gains. Deutsch, Shea andamp; Evans, an advertising and research company, says its tally of ads for engineers and scientists shows the busiest recruiting in more than a year. Separately, Christian andamp; Timbers, a search firm, predicts high-tech executive hiring will rise 2.9% this year after a 1.1% drop in 1986.    THE 40-HOUR WORKWEEK still rules at most state governments. Workplace Economics Inc., which analyzes labor data, says the 40-hour week remains the norm in 35 states. Eleven states work 37 1/2-hour weeks; one state requires 35 1/2 hours, while three have a 35-hour schedule.    TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES mean a loss for workers without union voice.    According to a study edited by sociologist Daniel Cornfield of Vanderbilt University, management tends to wield increased power over employees when automation comes to industries with weak or no unionization, or where workers don't feel their jobs are especially threatened. The Postal Service, for instance, dropped some jobs by one pay level after new equipment was introduced.    In highly unionized industries, however, especially those hit by hard times, new technology has led to increased labor-management cooperation, with both sides giving up something, concludes the volume from Plenum Publishing Corp. It cites an accord signed by Boeing Co. and the International Association of Machinists in 1983 that recognizes &quot;the most efficient machines&quot; as a common goal and pledges the company to make retraining available.    Cooperation, though, could have its limits if either side concludes its concessions are too costly to bear.    THE CHECKOFF: First-year M.B.A. students at Stanford Business School pledge $15,000 from summer earnings to help 10 classmates who took lower-paying jobs with nonprofit groups. . . . Teamsters have principals. School principals in Manchester, N.H., join the union, which already represents some principals elsewhere. </TEXT></DOC>
