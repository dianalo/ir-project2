McKernan.   McKernan is planning a trip to California this fall to hobnobwith producers in hopes of luring more film industry business tothe state. But McKernan also has an ulterior motive: trying to landa cameo role on the CBS mystery show.   McKernan's possible road to stardom started when a loyal watcherof the weekly mystery show spotted a photo of former DemocraticGov. Joseph E. Brennan while visiting the Hollywood set recently,and called the governor's office.   McKernan's spokesman, Willis Lyford, said an autographed photoof the governor was promptly dispatched to actress Angela Lansbury,who plays mystery writer and detective Jessica Fletcher on the show.   McKernan must first pass a photo test, however, so a few shotsof him riding a school bus with children and visiting fairs arebeing sent to Hollywood for approval.   It's ``a portfolio ... to determine if he's suitable,'' saidLyford.</TEXT></DOC>
