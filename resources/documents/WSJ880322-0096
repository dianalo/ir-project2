Jacobs (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Short interest rose a sharp 14% on the New York Stock Exchange and increased 8% on the American Stock Exchange for the month ended last Tuesday.    The Big Board said short interest rose 53,398,497 shares to 436,763,450 shares. In the month ended Feb. 12, the figure was 383,364,953. In the year-earlier month ended in mid-March, short interest was 453,527,893.    After posting declines for two months, Amex short interest increased 2,352,371 shares, to 30,197,347, the Amex said. In the month ended Feb. 12, short interest totaled an adjusted 27,969,976; a year ago the figure was an adjusted 31,808,363.    The increase &quot;is more impressive for equities than it might look,&quot; said Philip B. Erlanger, chief technical analyst at Advest Inc., a Hartford, Conn., brokerage. He asserted that increases in various types of stocks were a &quot;bullish&quot; signal.    The level of negative expectations grew somewhat as the Big Board short-interest ratio rose to 2.34 times average trading volume from 2.18 the month before. The ratio is the number of trading days at average volume required to cover the total short interest.    Adjusted to remove issues subject to arbitrage and using those issues that are fully &quot;at risk,&quot; the ratio grew to 1.81 from 1.78 a month earlier. This so-called at-risk ratio continues to be a bullish indicator, according to Mr. Erlanger, who devised the measure.    &quot;Essentially, this means from a sentiment point of view that the market is looking for equities to move higher and for the fixed-income side, bonds, to be relatively weaker,&quot; Mr. Erlanger said. Bears betting on stock prices dropping, he said, &quot;are laying themselves down on the tracks in front of a train and are going to get hurt. I think these numbers are very bullish.&quot;    A short sale is the sale of borrowed stock. While a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's price will decline, some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish, because the borrowed shares eventually must be repurchased.    The seller in a short sale expects a price decline that would enable the purchase of an equal number of shares later at a lower price for return to the lender. The short interest is the number of shares that haven't been purchased for return to lenders.    Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging.    In a major method of securities arbitrage, a profit can be made when a company's stock is to be exchanged for that of another, or for a new issue, in a proposed merger. The profit opportunity arises when the stocks sell at disparate prices.    An arbitrager may make a per-share profit by buying stock of one company involved in the prospective merger and selling short the stock of the other.    Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co., a California utility, posted the biggest short-interest gain on the Big Board, to 14,718,106 shares from 3,290,476 the month before.    Another utility, Duke Power Co., posted the biggest Big Board drop for the month, a 76% decline to 890,168 shares. A month ago the Charlotte, N.C.-based utility recorded the biggest increase.    The adjacent tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares existed as of March 15 or in which there was a short-position change of at least 50,000 shares since mid-Febuary (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ March 22, 1988).
