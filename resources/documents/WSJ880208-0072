The committee had suggested that the eight members from outside the market who sit on the 28-member council should include in Lloyd's annual report their own assessment of progress on regulation as it affects the interests of investors in Lloyd's. But Lloyd's chief executive officer, Alan Lord, said the outside members felt that a separate report could be divisive and instead supported including a section on regulation in the annual report that all council members would endorse.    The council also rejected as unnecessary and undesirable a suggestion that the eight outside members and the eight representatives of investors in Lloyd's have separate staff.    The remaining 12 members of the council are working members of the market.    A Lloyd's spokesman said the council has implemented about half of the committee's 70 suggestions. The regulation of Lloyd's brokers is among the major issues remaining. Mr. Lord said the council would implement new broker regulations by April, including the decision made last week to eliminate a rule that had prevented insurance companies from owning more than 26% of Lloyd's brokers. </TEXT></DOC>
