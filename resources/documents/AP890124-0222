The guerrillas have been battling military and military-dominatedGuatemalan governments for a quarter-century. The northern area ofQuiche province, about 70 miles northwest of Guatemala City, was oneof their bastions in the early 1980s.   Government forces mounted a counterinsurgency campaign that hasreduced guerrilla activity to isolated and circumscribed zones.   The campaign was heavily criticized by human rights activists whoblamed the army for the massacre of tens of thousands of Indiansthroughout northern and western Guatemala.   The army sweeps and aerial bombardment drove thousands of Ixilsout of their homes and into the heights north of Nebaj.   Now they are trickling back.   ``They suffer hunger and sickness in the mountains,'' said AlbaMendez, psychologist for the government-licensed Special Commissionfor Refugees and the Displaced, or CEARD, as it is known by itsinitials in Spanish.   The human rights organization Americas Watch said in Novemberthat most of the 1,700 or so Indians who reached Nebaj in the firstsix months of 1988 were captured by government troops duringoffensives and forcibly removed.   But Indians continue to come down from the mountains, albeit at aslower pace, even though the armed forces have not carried outlarge-scale operations north of Nebaj in recent months.   Miss Mendez said an average of about 40 Ixils have arrived eachmonth since September. She said virtually all of them camevoluntarily.   Relief officials say about 4,500 Ixils have come out of themountains since 1987 and that several thousand probably remain inthe highlands.   Jacinto de Paz, who abandoned the hills with his wife and threechildren late last year, said he was a guerrilla political officerwho helped administer rebel-controlled hamlets.   ``They (the guerrillas) have told everyone the army killed me,''he said. ``But as you can see, I am not dead. Politically, they arelosing strength, so they tell a lot of lies. But the situation haschanged. That is why we're here.''   New arrivals are held at the army garrison for several days, withfighting-age men debriefed by intelligence officers. They are thentransferred to the Xemamatze camp about a mile outside Nebaj.   Some human rights groups have described Xemamatze as aconcentration camp, but a recent visitor saw no wire or fence aroundit. Refugees must check in and out at the gate but otherwise arefree to enter and leave.   In the camp, women in distinctive red skirts and multicoloredHuipil blouses cook food and tend children in front of wooden,tin-roofed shelters that border a courtyard that doubles as a soccerfield.   About 80 people were at Xemamatze in early January. In mid-1988as many as 580 people were housed there, CEARD officals said.   Officials at CEARD said the United Nations High Commission forRefugees pays for food, blankets and clothes distributed at the camp.   The displaced spend between one and three months at the campattending re-education classes. They are taught Guatemala's nationalanthem and indoctrinated with the idea that communism is evil.   From Xemamatze, they return to their old hamlets or take upresidence in one of the surrounding villages established by the armyand government.   The villages are made up of rows or clusters of wooden-walled,metal-roofed one-room dwellings with dirt floors. But they haveelectricity and communal potable water and are by most accounts animprovement on the sometimes nomadic life in the mountains.   Doctors and nurses from international relief organizations visitthe settlements, whose inhabitants also have access to a modernclinic in Nebaj.   In addition to providing homes for the displaced, the villagesare a means by which the military maintains control over apopulation that in the past demonstrated guerrilla sympathies.   Men aged 16 to 60 participate in civil defense patrols designedto inhibit guerrilla movement.   The villages are administered by locally elected councils thatwork closely with army authorities.   ``This war has become one of attention paid to people, of humanrelations,'' said Capt. Carlos Rodriguez of the Nebaj garrison.``People realize there has been a change in the way the army acts.Now we concentrate on psychological operations. We offer a hand tothose who come down (from the mountains) and to the subversives whorealize their error. We reserve the iron fist only for theintransigents.''
