No one was hurt, and it was not known who fired the shots.   Singh refused to say if he thought the shots were aimed at him,but one witness said: ``It was very close. It was obvious that thetarget of the gunmen was Raja Sahib.''   Singh is often called ``Raja Sahib,'' which means ``King Sir.''   Shots rang out as Singh got out of his car in the village ofDubrai, in Uttar Pradesh state, where he had gone to investigatereports that workers from Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's CongressParty were rigging polls.   The witness, who is not affiliated with Singh's oppositioncoalition, said the gunfire began as Singh was surrounded by acrowd of people who had alleged the ballot-fixing. The witnessspoke on condition of anonymity.   Another person at the scene also reported the shooting but saidhe could not tell if the shots were aimed at Singh.   Anand Sharma, chief spokesman for the Congress Party, was askedin New Delhi about the shooting. He replied that oppositionsupporters were ``responsible for all the violence'' in the area.   Today was the second of three days of voting in a parliamentaryelection, in which Gandhi faces the most determined challenge evermounted by the country's usually splintered opposition.   Singh's Janata Dal Party and the Congress Party have tradedcharges of widespread fraud and intimidation, and election-relatedviolence has killed at least 106 people.   The Election Commission said today it has ordered a revote at930 of the country's 590,000 voting booths following fraud reports.   In comments earlier today, 58-year-old Singh said, ``TheCongress is bent upon creating trouble here, but I am not going toallow that.'' In his wake, villagers armed with batons and spearsscreamed ``Death to the Congress!'' and vowed to protect votersfrom troublemakers.   Gandhi headed to Punjab state, which votes Sunday, for a lastcampaign swing.   At a rally in Bhatinda, he accused neighboring Pakistan ofarming and training Sikh separatists, who have killed about 1,640people this year in their fight for a separate nation in Punjab.Pakistan has denied such allegations.   In the first hours of voting today, clashes between CongressParty and Janata Dal supporters were reported in Calcutta andeastern Orissa state, but there were no immediate reports of deaths.   A total of 106 people have been killed in campaign-relatedviolence since Oct. 17, when elections were announced. Since votingbegan Wednesday, 62 people have died.   At stake in the elections are 524 of the 543 seats in the LokSabha, or House of the People, Parliament's policy-making lowerhouse. No results will be announced until after the last pollsclose Sunday.   Few real issues were at stake in the campaign, apart from Gandhihimself, who has been dogged for half of his five-year term byallegations of corruption in high government circles.   The National Front, an opposition coalition spearheaded bySingh's Janata Dal party, has promised to provide clean government.   But Gandhi told voters the only party capable of governing ishis Congress Party, whose most famous leaders were his grandfatherand mother, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Prime MinisterIndira Gandhi.   Gandhi was swept into office on a wave of sympathy after hismother's assassination in 1984, winning 415 of Parliament's 543seats. However, recent polls indicated he could lose the electionor be forced into an unwieldy coalition with smaller parties thistime.   The Congress Party has governed India for all but 29 monthssince the country became independent 42 years ago.   Voting today was spread across 10 states and two federallygoverned territories, where a total of 264 million people wereeligible to vote.   The total number of eligible voters is 498 million. Most of therest of India's 25 states and seven territories voted Wednesday. OnSunday, voting will take place in three states.   Elections for the 14 seats in northeastern Assam state have beenpostponed indefinitely because of incomplete voter rolls, and a fewother contests were delayed because of candidates' deaths.</TEXT></DOC>
