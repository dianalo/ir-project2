MSI Data, Costa Mesa, Calif., a maker of hand-held portable data-entry computer terminals, recently agreed to be acquired by Symbol Technologies Inc. for $23 a share, or an indicated $115.7 million for the MSI shares Symbol doesn't already own.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Alpine, a registered broker-dealer, and ZH Associates, a partnership in the business of trading in securities, said they hold 381,600 MSI common shares, all purchased from Sept. 9 to Oct. 20 for $16.572 to $22.625.    During that period MSI was fighting a hostile takeover attempt by Telxon Corp. On Sept. 9, Telxon launched a hostile bid of $17 a share, or an indicated $89.5 million. Telxon later sweetened its bid to $20 a share. MSI agreed to be acquired by Symbol Technologies on Sept. 29 and the tender offer expires Nov. 2. Symbol is a Bohemia, N.Y., maker of bar-code scanners.    The partnerships said they hold their stock as an investment.    An MSI official said, &quot;I don't believe they are buying it for a long-term investment. They bought it with the expectation that they will realize $23 a share when the tender offer is completed on Nov. 2.&quot; MSI has about 5.2 million common shares outstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
