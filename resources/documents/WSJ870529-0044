At a time when American women are breaking age-old barriers in business, medicine and education, a growing number are also making big waves in a less illustrious field: white-collar crime.    Arrests of women for such crimes as fraud and embezzlement have risen sharply in recent years, especially when compared with rates for men arrested for similar offenses. For example, Federal Bureau of Investigation figures show that between 1976 and 1985 the number of women arrested for embezzlement increased 55%, compared with a 1% decrease for men. Fraud arrests among women shot up 84% in the same period, nearly twice the rise among men.    &quot;Used to be, about the only thing you caught women for was cashing a bad check at the grocery store,&quot; says Richard Poe, head of the Pinellas County, Fla., economic-crimes unit. &quot;Now we're seeing a big increase in women moving into more conventional types of white-collar crime.&quot; Adds Paul Marcus, dean of the University of Arizona law school, &quot;White-collar crime among women has reached epidemic proportions in the last 10 years.&quot;    Much of the increase, of course, can be explained by the tremendous influx of women into the workplace, especially into positions of financial responsibility such as office supervision and investment management. In addition, male-dominated companies seem more willing to crack down on female offenders -- who still fill many lower-level clerical assignments -- than on upper-level male managers, whose exposure would cause the company considerably more embarrassment.    &quot;Women (offenders) tend to be small-time thieves, and small-time thieves are fundamentally more likely to be found and prosecuted than big thieves,&quot; contends G.J. Bologna, the president of Computer Protection Systems Inc., a Plymouth, Mich., fraud-protection concern.    Those familiar with the problem, however, say there are other factors involved. &quot;The new professional women are becoming greater risk takers than they used to be,&quot; asserts Sandi Gostin, a convicted embezzler who runs a San Francisco-based support group for women who can't control their spending. &quot;There is a high that comes from the manipulation of money and debts,&quot; she adds, contending that some women -- like some men -- are lured by the &quot;excitement&quot; of fraud.    Moreover, the new wave of female white-collar criminals is sweeping up some surprisingly big fish. One of them is Rebecca Ann Doyle, a 37-year-old former insurance broker in St. Petersburg, Fla., who owned several companies and a 24% stake in a Florida bank, and was named American Business Woman of the Year by one group in 1979. In 1985, she began a three-year prison sentence after embezzling more than $1.8 million from escrow accounts she managed for a Philadelphia insurance company.    As white-collar crime among women has increased, some telling contrasts between male and female offenders have become apparent. A recent Yale University study found, for example, that white-collar men who steal typically take far more money than women -- an average of 10 times more. &quot;The differences are amazing,&quot; says Kathleen Daly, an associate professor of sociology and the author of the study.    The study also found that female white-collar criminals, who are largely clerical workers, tend to get involved in simpler frauds, and usually act alone and out of concern for their families. Many of their male counterparts, by contrast, tend to be conspiring managers. And while men tend to use stolen funds for luxury items such as sports cars, women embezzlers &quot;may be motivated more from a need to 'make ends meet,'&quot; Ms. Daly says.    Ms. Bruchey, the former teller, who received probation for her crimes, is in many ways a typical offender. She says that her embezzling began when she noticed colleagues &quot;borrowing&quot; from their money drawers. &quot;I started out taking a small amount,&quot; she recalls, &quot;and I intended to repay it.&quot;    But where other tellers apparently kept their borrowings small, &quot;mine got bigger and bigger,&quot; Ms. Bruchey says. &quot;Then I got caught up in it and lost touch with reality. I've often equated it to someone who was an alcoholic or was on drugs. It was like an addiction. I could not stop.&quot;    Just divorced at the time, Ms. Bruchey initially used the money for such necessities as paying the rent and providing for her two children. But like many offenders, she says she eventually lost control and began stealing &quot;just to have a nicer life style.&quot; Guilt-ridden, she grew so fearful of being discovered that she quit her job, hired a lawyer and confessed.    Another thread running through the crimes of many female offenders is men. &quot;Most women thieves in prison are there because of the man in their life,&quot; contends Ms. Gostin of the San Francisco help group. &quot;These women will do anything for their men, including stealing.&quot;    Consider Doris Giglio, a 57-year-old former insurance administrator for an Indiana manufacturing concern, who was recently released from a Texas federal prison after serving less than two years. Caught by the Internal Revenue Service, Ms. Giglio had pleaded guilty to embezzling nearly $180,000 -- most of which, according to lawyers involved in the case, apparently went to her young boyfriend, a company clerical worker in his 30s who was never accused of a crime.    Ms. Giglio couldn't be reached for comment. At her sentencing, however, she had told the judge of her boyfriend: &quot;I don't hate him, but I hope someday he goes through the hell that I had to go through. It's been hell knowing how I've been treated and used.&quot;    Some women -- though comparatively few -- say they stole in part because they felt their employers weren't paying them enough. Carol, a 26-year-old former office manager for a Los Angeles health-care concern, says she began embezzling when her spending outstripped the raises she received from promotions.    &quot;There was a part of me that said, 'I was the one that made this company grow so fast -- maybe they owe me something,'&quot; she explains.    With money stolen by writing company checks to herself, Carol -- who asked that her last name not be used -- bought a Rolex watch for her brother and paid off all her sister's credit-card bills. Out of sheer boredom, she says, she would spend $500 or more at a local mall in less than an hour. The size of the checks she wrote herself grew from $200 to $1,700 each, and by the time she voluntarily confessed to her employer in November 1985 she had stolen more than $10,000.    In part because her parents helped her make restitution, her boss didn't prosecute. After undergoing extensive counseling, Carol now works at a major telecommunications concern that knows nothing of her past.    &quot;Job interviews were hell,&quot; she says. &quot;If an employer asked why I left my last job, what do I say, 'Embezzlement, fraud -- anything else you want to talk about?'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
