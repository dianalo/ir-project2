The insecticide, also known as DDVP and Vapona, is being put through the EPA's special review process because animal studies show it could cause cancer and damage the liver and nervous system. Dichlorvos has been used since 1948 and is designed to control flies, mosquitoes, gnats, cockroaches and other insects.    Of two million pounds used annually, some 15% is used in the home and on pets. About 60% is used on livestock, poultry, livestock buildings, tobacco and greenhouse crops, and 25% on lawns, ornamental plants and in commercial or industrial buildings.    Consumers can be exposed to dichlorvos by consuming foods containing pesticide residues or by occupying buildings treated with the pesticide or containing certain pest strips, the EPA said. Also at potential risk are workers who apply the pesticide, and pets.    Last September, the EPA imposed certain restrictions on application and labeling of dichlorvos products, although many domestic products, including pest strips and pet products, weren't restricted. The EPA review process weighs the risk and benefits of a pesticide to determine if it should be restricted or banned. The public will have 60 days to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
