 Several new Mac applicationsthat use geography as a platform for data analysis recently have beenintroduced or upgraded (see story, Page 38).andP;  Here we look at two of the moreaccessible programs in this category: GeoQuery 2.0 from GeoQuery Corp. andAtlas MapMaker 4.5 from Strategic Mapping Inc.andM;GeoQueryandM;GeoQuery is primarily a ZIP-code mapping program.andP;  For most social andcommercial data, ZIP codes are the only locational information available.andO;GeoQuery also understands state and county names in full or abbreviated formsand FIPS codes (six-digit codes identifying counties).andM;GeoQuery begins by asking for a base map.andP;  The 48 contiguous states, plusAlaska and Hawaii (three separate maps), are included with the program.andP;  Themaps are well-drawn, with familiar projections and come on-screen reasonablyquickly.andP;  Once the map is on-screen, the view can be reframed and unwantedareas deleted.andP;  The map can be moved on the page by dragging, or the scalecan be changed by typing in a miles-to-inches ratio.andM;The next step is to import data that includes ZIP codes.andP;  GeoQuery can readtab-delimited text files, data stored in the Clipboard or it can perform anSQL query over a network using Apple's Data Access Manager, if installed.andO;When importing, you're shown the first line of the data file and asked toidentify which field holds the ZIP code, which field should be used to labelthe map points and which to use to divide them into categories.andM;The file is then read, and the records are added to the map as point symbols(called pushpins in GeoQuery).andP;  Once the ZIP codes are translated to mappositions, locations that fall outside the current map frame are filteredout.andM;Distances on the map can be measured with the on-screen ruler, but theresults can't be recorded.andP;  Text labels can be placed over the map and movedaround.andP;  No drawing tools are provided, but graphics created in otherprograms can be pasted in.andM;Interactive use.andP;  The GeoQuary map is interactive.andP;  One tool allows the userto display a pushpin's label (for example, a customer's name) as a text boxattached by a line.andP;  The labels can be moved around, with the linemaintaining contact -- a good feature for unscrambling clusters of pushpins.andO;Another tool displays the pin's full data record in a separate window.andP;  Onlyone point's data can be displayed at a time.andM;If an existing unit, such as a county, is selected, a long report or a briefsummary of the pins within it can be shown.andM;Multiple selections can be made and new areas can be created.andP;  To create anew area, you split existing areas or draw enclosing circles and polygons onthe map.andP;  These new units can be named and appear in reports just like thepredefined basemap units.andP;  Report windows cannot be saved, however, so theClipboard is the only way to get the results to another program.andM;Pushpins can be grouped into categories, represented by different symbols.andO;If the data falls naturally into classes, the symbols provided are fine, butif it consists of a continuous range of values (for example, annual sales)the symbols should clearly express increasing value throughout thecategories.andP;  The symbols available in GeoQuery do not do this very well.andM;Choropleth maps.andP;  GeoQuery also can load data coded by states or countiesrather than ZIP codes.andP;  In this mode it reads or calculates a value for eacharea and shades it accordingly, producing a type of map known as achoropleth.andP;  This is useful for viewing background information, such aspopulation and economic statistics, by itself or correlated with pushpins.andO;The number of data divisions, how ranges are calculated and the colorsassigned to them can be configured.andP;  While GeoQuery can't produce choroplethmaps counting or summarizing ZIP code data, Strategic Mapping's Zip/Atlasprogram (see below) can be used with GeoQuery to overcome these limitations.andM;The base maps provided with GeoQuery show state boundaries and includecentroid points for five-digit ZIP codes.andP;  To map at the county level, youhave to buy separate base maps for each state or region.andP;  Maps for Areas ofDominant Influence (ADI), Designated Market areas (DMA) and MetropolitanStatistical Areas (MSA) also are available.andP;  No other base maps can be used.andO;Base maps cannot be altered, and no provision is made for drawing new maps.andM;The data provided with GeoQuery is taken from the U.S.andP;  State and County DataBook.andP;  For each of the 50 states, it has 207 categories covering population,health, education, housing, employment, income, farming, sales and employmentby sectors, government finances and elections.andP;  If you buy a state orregional map, you get similar data broken down by counties.andP;  The data comesin tab-delimited text files, so it can be used with other programs.andM;Performance.andP;  GeoQuery runs well on a Mac Plus with 1 Mbyte of RAM, althoughit is limited to about 850 records.andP;  It runs much better on a Mac II-classmachine, where it can handle more than 30,000 records with 4 Mbytes of RAM.andO;A color monitor expands the utility of the program considerably.andM;The manual is good, with useful tutorial examples.andP;  The on-screen help iseven better.andM;GeoQuery needs to have a way of showing the magnitude of symbols more clearly-- either by a set of symbols that form a clear hierarchy or by scaledsymbols.andP;  Drawing tools would be a welcome addition, especially one forarrows.andP;  The default palette of colors is poorly chosen, though it can beredefined via the Apple Color Picker.andP;  Combining background statistics as achoropleth with pushpin data points is a potentially powerful capability.andO;For example, you could map per-capita income in the background and proposedretail locations as pushpins.andM;GeoQuery can handle only one map per window, so you cannot show all 50 stateson one map, since Alaska and Hawaii have their own.andP;  Multiple map windows canbe open simultaneously, however.andM;Export of selected records is well-implemented.andP;  Pushpins selected by any ofseveral methods can be saved to a text file, which will even pick up theheader information of the original data file.andM;Since data is read from an external file each time the map is opened and notincorporated into the GeoQuery file, there is no way to edit it withoutquitting the program.andP;  This is a major annoyance.andP;  It would also be nice tobe able to view the data as a table.andM;MapMakerandM;MapMaker provides features for creation of both base maps and thematic maps.andO;The program works strictly with longitude and latitude coordinates, butZIP-code data can be translated.andP;  MapMaker's great strength is that it canmake a map of anything that can be described by coordinates.andM;To create a map, MapMaker accesses one or more special boundary files.andP;  Abasic set of boundary files comes with the program, including various U.S.andO;outlines, state maps showing county outlines and outlines of other countries.andO;Many more are sold separately, but maps also can be compiled from text files.andO;All features on the map have names associated with them.andP;  These can bedisplayed, and their positions adjusted.andP;  Because there is no visualconnection between the name and the feature, though, it is possible toscramble the labels.andM;An important application of MapMaker is to create base maps, then export themin PICT format for use with other programs.andP;  This is especially useful if themapping project begins with only raw longitude and latitude or ZIP-code data,or if the final result must be of extremely high quality.andM;Text, points, circles, and closed and open polygons can be drawn on-screen asadditions to an existing map or to create new maps.andM;Previously.andP;  MapMaker's coordinate-only approache could be a real problemwhen the only locational data you had was based on ZIP codes.andP;  But one ofStrategic Mapping's stand-alone products, Zip/Atlas, has been incorporatedinto MapMaker, solving this problem.andP;  Both Zip/Atlas and MapMaker can convertZIP codes to latitude-longitude locations.andP;  They also can group ZIP-codeitems, counting how many fall into specified areas, such as counties orstates.andP;  This is a valuabel feature that can be used with other programs.andM;Thematic maps.andP;  The real power of MapMaker is apparent when a text file ofdata is imported.andP;  Each line of data must begin with the primary name of amap featureandgt; for states, this is usually the two-letter postal abbreviation,and for counties, the FIPS code.andP;  It can be anything, however, as long asthere is an exact match with a map elementandgt; any values in the data that don'tmatch with features on the map are ignored.andP;  Up to 30 categories of data canbe loaded at once, each of which serves as a basis for a thematic map.andP;  Eachcan be generated rapidly with a simple menu selection.andM;Unfortunately, MapMaker's default parameters for drawing maps are seldomsatisfactory.andP;  Diagonal lines and crosshatch patterns (holdovers from theplotters-output days) are the default fills for choropleth maps.andP;  However, arange of laser-printer halfstones is available that can be set to apply toall maps.andP;  MapMaker's default division of data into five categories of evenlyspaced intervals is also questionable.andP;  This equal-interval method can bechanged so that an equal number of map elements fall into each category.andM;A similar problem occurs when you map point features rather than areas.andO;MapMaker assigns five point symbols, which do not form a clear hierarchy.andP;  Asuperior alternative is available, however.andP;  The Graduated Shapes optiongives each point location a circle or square symbol scaled to the data value.andO;None of the other Mac mapping programs we've seen has this important feature.andO;It is impaired, however, by MapMaker's inability to create a meaningfullegend: The legend shows all five symbols as the same size.andM;There are two options for display of area data other than choropleth: areacartogram and dot density.andP;  In cartograms, the sizes of base-map areas arescaled to their relative data values.andP;  This sounds good, but seldom producesa usable result.andM;The dot-density method is quite useful.andP;  Dots are scattered in the areasaccording to their data values.andP;  Both the number of dots on the map and thevalue of an individual dot can be controlled.andM;Most map elements can be manipulated and you can remove unneeded featuresfrom the base map and add new features.andP;  New data categories can be created,and data can be entered or imported.andP;  Multiple layers can be created forbase-map, thematic-data and hand-drawn features, but data is displayedon-screen from only one layer at a time.andP;  Layers can be copied to otherlayers to display all the data at once, but once they are merged, they can'tbe changed.andM;Analysis.andP;  As long as a map is based on latitude and longitude, accuratemeasurements can be made with the Ruler and Radius tools.andP;  The cursor'sposition is displayed, and any of these results can be stamped on the map.andO;Because none of the objects can be selected on-screen (except those drawn ontop of the map), it is not possible to query the map interactively.andP;  Thereare no analytical tools that summarize points within areas, average values,etc.andM;Limitations.andP;  MapMaker offers a limited choice of colors.andP;  The manual is notelegant, but it does cover the ground adequately.andP;  Unfortunately, it includessome bad examples in the tutorial section.andP;  There is no on-screen help.andM;When creating a new map or resizing one, there is no way to scale itprecisely or to automatically generate a graphic scaleandgt; the measuring tooltends to jump between odd values, such as from 99.87 to 100.60 miles.andO;Default legends are poor and cannot be adequately modified.andM;Conclusions.andP;  On balance, MapMaker is a useful but limited program.andP;  While itis fast and generally easy to use, it is flawed by a sometimes-crudeinterface.andP;  The default settings for thematic data divisions, legends, fillpatterns, and the control over map layers and scaling are poorly implemented.andO;On-screen maps are interactive and there are no analysis tools.andP;  However,MapMaker is unequalled at quickly creating thematic maps from statisticaldata.andP;  It is an excellent way to produce base maps for export to illustrationprograms.andM;GeoQuery's base maps are attractive and accurate.andP;  Printing directly fromGeoQuery gives good results, but export to illustration programs can be doneonly via the Clipboard and sometimes results in loss of color.andP;  The symbolsused are bit maps, and thus will print and scale poorly.andP;  Access to ZIP-codedinformation is the program's strong suit.andP;  Points are loaded fast, with nofuss or confusion.andP;  Interactive use, querying the map, and generating summaryand list reports are all well-implemented.andP;  Choropleth mapping by states orcounties also is well-done.andP;  For users concerned with studying pointlocations, especially in the larger context of their socioeconomicenvironment, GeoQuery should be the program of choice.andM;Desktop mapping: Ready for takeoffandM;The increasing availability of commercial geographic data is creating demandfor thematic-mapping programs.andP;  The U.S.andP;  Census Bureau created a street mapof the country for the 1990 census, and the results are becoming available ascensus data is released.andP;  Other large-scale surveys also will be distributedon CD-ROM.andP;  Traditional mapping products from the U.S.andP;  Geological Survey andother agencies are now making the transition to digital form.andP;  The stage isset for software that empowers individuals to take advantage of theseresources for presentation graphics, desktop publishing and multimedia.andM;On a computer, maps can be interactive, providing graphical access tounderlying databases.andP;  In these geographical information systems, maps,graphs, tables and lists work together: Click on an item in a list and youwill see its full database entry, its position in a graph and its location ona map simultaneously highlighted.andP;  Seamless, multilayer maps in a variety ofscales and resolutions can be produced without the limitations of the printedpage.andP;  Maps can even be animated.andM;Until recently, there were only two primary thematic mapping programs for theMac: Strategic Mapping Inc.'s Atlas MapMaker and GeoQuery Corp.'s GeoQuery.andO;Both have been upgraded, to versions 4.5 and 2.0, respectively.andP;  Two newpackages with even broader capabilities, MapInfo Corp.'s MapInfo and IntermapInc.'s Descartes, will be covered in a subsequent review.andM;All four products use base maps -- general maps of physical features such asmountains, rivers, roads, cities, property lines and place names -- as theunderlying data for creating thematic maps.andP;  Thematic maps add information,such as current demographic and economic data, marketing plans, customerlocations and research data, to a base map.andM;The best base-map data is obtained from specialized sources.andP;  All fourpackages include some general-purpose base maps, and more-detailed maps canbe purchased separately.andP;  They provide general demographic and social data.andO;The programs also allow import of database and spreadsheet data, as well asthe creation of new map elements.andM;None of the current software meets the high graphical standards oftraditional cartography, however, even though the results are better thanthose from related geographical information systems and CAD programs onworkstations and minicomputers.andP;  The fact that output is optimized for laserprinters rather than pen plotters places Mac-based mapping in a class byitself.andM;To bring the final product up to what is considered publication quality, youcan finish a map in an illustration program such as Aldus FreeHand or AdobeIllustrator.andP;  The smooth curved lines, precisely defined fills and controlover placement of text that they offer are essential for professional-qualitymaps.andM;ON BALANCEandM;Desktop mapping programsandM;There are many ways to visualize data, but the geographical map is one of themost familiar.andP;  These two desktop mapping programs enable users to view theirbusiness ventures with the world as a backdrop.andM;* GeoQuery 2.0 from GeoQuery Corp. is a smooth, well-designed product withfeatures suited to business users' needs.andP;  It produces good thematic maps --mapping of ZIP-code locations is especially strong -- and includes links toSQL databases.andP;  It has excellent tools for querying on-screen maps,constructing new map regions and preparing lists, but there are no drawingtools, and export of reports and graphics is weak.andP;  Adequate base maps andexcellent statistical data are provided, but users cannot create their ownbase maps as they can in other programs.andP;  It is the least expensive of thecurrent batch of desktop mapping programs.andM;* MapMaker 4.5 from Strategic Mapping Inc. is in many ways the opposite ofGeoQuery: It's a better program for making maps from scratch, and it is agood choice for assembly-line production of thematic maps.andP;  A wide range ofmapping options is available, but some are badly flawed.andP;  Although theprogram is reasonably fast and straight-forward, the clumsy interface coulduse an overhaul.andP;  Unlike GeoQuery, on-screen maps are not interactive, andanalytical tools are poor.andP;  Strategic Mapping provides excellent base maps,and more can be purchased.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
