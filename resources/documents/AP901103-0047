(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Officials fine-tuning Atherton'sdisaster plans have a new message in the event of an earthquake orother natural disaster: Just touch that dial.   The wealthy suburb 20 miles south of San Francisco is givingeach household a tiny radio already tuned to a local station thatwill broadcast emergency information.   Static over information distribution during last year'searthquake prompted the program.   ``Our main problem during last year's earthquake wasdissemination of information to the public,'' said Police Chief KipRolle. ``We needed to tell people that everything was OK.''   After the Oct. 17, 1989, quake, power and telephone service wasdisrupted, and most media attention was focused on larger citiesand areas that suffered substantial damage, officials said.   But next time disaster strikes, the town's 8,000 residents canuse their new radios to listen to KCEA, a non-profit FM station atMenlo Atherton High School.   The station, which has emergency generators, will broadcastlocal emergency information from the town's disaster command post.   Officials decided to pre-set the radios so people wouldn't haveto remember KCEA's dial setting, 89.1, said Councilwoman NanChapman.   The City Council allocated $25,000 for the radios, which policeare distributing this month. The council hopes to be reimbursed bydonations.</TEXT></DOC>
