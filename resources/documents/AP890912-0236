Without admitting or denying guilt, Toronto-Dominion Bank agreedMonday not to violate federal banking and securities laws governingthe extension of credit. The bank also agreed to cooperate with thegovernment's investigation of the case.   The SEC last month accused Toronto-Dominion of illegallyextending credit to a group of investors known as GraycliffInternational SA to buy millions of dollars worth of securitieswithout having enough money to pay for them.   According to the civil suit filed Aug. 2 in U.S. District Courtin Manhattan, the bank allegedly allowed the investors to sell thestock on the same day at a profit to cover their cost in a schemeknown as ``free-riding.''   ``This is a very significant case from our point of view,'' saidMartin Kuperberg, the SEC's associate regional administrator in NewYork.   ``It sends an important message to the banking and stockbrokerage industry that the SEC is not going to stand for this typeof activity,'' he said. ``People have to pay for stock when they buyit.''   Kuperberg said officials knew of no other cases in which the SEChad charged a bank involved in a free-riding case but that investorshad been charged in the past.   He said there was no estimate of how much money the bank madefrom the accounts set up by the Graycliff investors.   Toronto-Dominion officials did not return a telephone callseeking comment. The bank said in a statement at the time of thesuit that it had been cooperating with the SEC for several monthsand was ``an innocent bystander'' to the investigation.   The SEC charged investors Jury Matt Hansen and Fergus M. SloanJr., and their New York brokerage firm, Fermat Associates, withfraud in connection with the illegal stock-selling practice. Thebank was not charged with fraud.   According to the suit, the investors through Graycliff opened anaccount at the New York branch of Toronto-Dominion, which oftencovered the investors' checks overnight when the funds in theaccount were insufficient.   The investors then allegedly opened about 250 accounts at morethan 100 brokerage using 76 phony names. The SEC claims that thedefendants used the accounts to buy and sell securities on the sameday beginning in December 1984.   Tornoto-Dominion cleared both the buy and sell side of the stocktransactions, according to the SEC.   The SEC suit claims the men made more than $1 million through thescheme but left debts of $1.5 million at four brokerage houses atwhich they had steep losses: Steinberg andamp; Lyman, Universal Securitiesof America Inc., Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and Dominick andamp; Dominick.   The SEC said it found no losses at any other brokerages.   Under its settlement, Toronto-Dominion also agreed to set up asecurities compliance committee to review the bank's credit policiesand implement a training program in the area.</TEXT></DOC>
