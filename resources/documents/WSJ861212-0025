The agency, however, didn't say how much.    It did say rates will be graduated and vary among 11 different wage and price zones around the country. And it made clear that most Chinese won't be affected because they don't earn enough.    Anyone in Peking whose income is the equivalent of more than $108 a month will have to pay. At current exchange rates, however, the average Peking resident earns only $43 monthly. Nationwide, the average urban income last year was $16.92 monthly, while the average rural income was $8.92 monthly.    China's 17 million private entrepreneurs already pay income taxes, as do resident foreigners and their offices.
