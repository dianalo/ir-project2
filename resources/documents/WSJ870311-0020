Sources close to Supermarkets General said possible steps include seeking another suitor, taking the company private, buying back some shares and making an acquisition of its own.    As soon as it received Dart's $41.75-a-share proposal late Friday, the Woodbridge, N.J.-based food retailer formally retained Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. to study the Dart bid and other possibilities. According to sources close to Supermarkets General, the company feels an obligation to shareholders to consider the bid from the Landover, Md.-based discount retailer and any proposals that may come from other suitors, but it has a strong desire to remain independent.    An adviser to Supermarkets General said that several prospective suitors have shown &quot;a lot of interest&quot; in the company, but he declined to identify any of them.    &quot;We are exploring all avenues,&quot; said Harvey M. Krueger, a managing director of Shearson and a Supermarkets General director. &quot;It's too soon to make a judgment. We still are in the process of evaluating and studying at this point,&quot; Mr. Krueger added.    Though the pursuit of other options would appear to suggest that Supermarkets General will resist Dart's bid, Mr. Krueger declined to speculate on the course of action the company is likely to take.    Industry specialists view Supermarkets General as a well-managed retailer with adequate resources to sustain growth on its own. In recent years, the company has experienced annual earnings growth of 24%. In the fiscal nine months ended Nov. 1, revenue rose 11% to $4.07 billion from a year earlier. The company ranks eighth in size among U.S. supermarket chains.    &quot;Supermarkets feels like someone threw them a life preserver when they were standing on solid ground,&quot; said a source close to the company.    Though Supermarkets General's share price surged Monday, Wall Street seemed to take a wait-and-see attitude toward the Dart bid yesterday.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Supermarkets General closed at $41.125, down 62.5 cents.    Herbert H. Haft and his son, Robert, Dart's chairman and president, respectively, have a reputation for putting companies into play and then not buying them. Last year, after a bid for Safeway Stores Inc., the nation's largest supermarket chain, Dart made a profit of roughly $140 million on its Safeway holdings when the concern was acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. in a leveraged buyout.    Dart's bid last week, however, wasn't its first approach to Supermarkets General. According to sources, Dart first contacted the company late last year about taking Supermarkets General private in a joint transaction, but was rebuffed.    On Feb. 13, following a published report that Dart had been accumulating Supermarkets General's shares, officials of the supermarket chain hired Joseph H. Flom, a prominent takeover lawyer, as its adviser. Supermarkets General called the Hafts later that day and expressed &quot;great displeasure,&quot; according to a source close to the company.    On the advice of Mr. Flom and others, Supermarkets General met briefly with the Hafts to convey its belief that stockholders &quot;would be best served by remaining independent,&quot; the source said.    In a second, longer meeting in late February, the Hafts sought to persuade Supermarkets General officials that Dart could acquire the company and still have enough money to maintain the food chain's rapid rate of growth. The Hafts followed with telephone calls, but were told each time that the company wasn't ready to talk.    If Supermarkets General decides to make an acquisition of its own, an adviser to the company said, &quot;resources wouldn't be a constricting factor.&quot; He declined to identify possible targets, but indicated that they would be retailers. &quot;What Supermarkets knows best is how to market,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
