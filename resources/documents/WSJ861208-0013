ZweigStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/08/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CCIBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Citibank has set up a risk arbitrage unit, believed to be the only one currently in operation at a U.S. commercial bank, to trade in the shares of companies involved in friendly, announced mergers and acquisitions.    So far the unit has invested nearly $50 million in the common stock of such companies, according to David T. King, vice president in charge of the unit.    Earlier this year, Chemical New York Corp. attempted to establish a unit that would have speculated in the shares of companies rumored to be targets of hostile takeover bids. But the effort was scrapped following protests by certain Chemical directors, who thought that such speculation put the banking concern into a highly controversial area.    In contrast, the Citibank move is bound to arouse far less controversy for several reasons. Investing in friendly announced transactions is not considered as risky, nor is it seen as abetting corporate raiders. Although the profit potential for such investments isn't nearly as great, it's understood that the unit, which without public announcement began trading last August with a $50 million stake, so far has earned about $1 million, for an annualized return on assets of about 5%.    That compares with the overall return on assets, an important measure of bank profitability, of 0.55% for the first nine months of 1986 by the bank's parent, Citicorp. But the new unit's earnings are just a drop in Citicorp's profitability bucket; the company earned $752 million in the first nine months this year.    &quot;The more boring the deal, the happier we are with it,&quot; Mr. King said. He said he is satisfied if the unit can make profits of 25 cents to $2 a share on trades of target company stocks, where a takeover is completed at the expected price.    Investments have included Nashville, Tenn.-based HealthAmerica Corp., a large operator of health maintenance organizations, which was bought last month for $385 million by Los Angeles-based Maxicare Health Plans Inc.; Western Air Lines, which Delta Air Lines agreed to acquire for $860 million; and Eastern Airlines, which is being acquired for $600 million by Texas Air Corp. Mr. King added that the unit has since sold its stakes in these companies.    Mr. King acknowledged that the transgressions of arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky have &quot;sensitized&quot; Citibank to the pitfalls of risk arbitrage. While arbitrage operations at a number of Wall Street investment houses have sustained heavy losses in the wake of the insider trading scandal, Mr. King said that &quot;because of the kinds of deals we're in, it hasn't had much of an effect. We haven't gotten hit very hard.&quot;    The 37-year-old Mr. King indicated that his compensation is substantially below that earned by top Wall Street arbitragers, who can make well over $1 million annually. &quot;I'm making what a vice president at Citibank makes,&quot; he said. Citibank vice presidents generally make between $80,000 and $200,000 annually.    The unit, which includes a trader and research assistant, is &quot;well insulated&quot; from Citibank's loan officers so that the unit doesn't receive inside information on corporate clients, Mr. King said. He said the bank forbids anyone managing money to discuss corporate matters with loan officers.    Separately, Mr. King said that his operation, which also develops new investment banking products, is seeking to devise alternatives to &quot;junk bonds,&quot; high-yielding bonds used to finance corporate takeovers. That market has been weakened by the insider trading scandal. He said Citicorp expects by the end of 1987 to sell high-yielding limited partnership shares to foreign investors through its overseas offices. The money would be used to finance takeovers. </TEXT></DOC>
