U.S. District Judge James E. Noland said Friday he would decideTuesday when the Cypriots could take possession of the mosaics,which remain locked in an Indianapolis vault.   The delay was in response to a motion filed by the Cypriotsseeking immediate possession of the artworks.   Noland ruled Thursday that Peg L. Goldberg of suburbanIndianapolis must return the mosaics, which were stolen from aGreek Orthodox church in Cyprus about 10 years ago.   Attorneys for Ms. Goldberg, meanwhile, filed a motion Friday tokeep the mosaics in Indiana pending a possible appeal.   Joe C. Emerson, an attorney for Ms. Goldberg, said that if theCypriots were allowed to take the mosaics out of the United Statesthere would be ``grave difficulties'' in getting the artworks back.   Thomas R. Kline, an attorney for the Cypriots, said his clientswere determined to reclaim the mosaics ``as soon as possible.''   A local Greek Orthodox priest had stood by Friday to bless themosaics.   Michael Kyprianou, senior counsel for the Republic of Cyprus,said an icon which belongs to a church can only be removed after ablessing is given by a priest. ``The same procedure is followedwhen you want to take it back,'' Kyprianou said.   In Cyprus, Archbishop Chrysostomos of Cyprus hailed the courtdecision Friday as opening the way for the recovery of stolenarchaeological treasures worldwide.   ``This encourages us to seek the recovery of other lootedtreasures because it will discourage international art merchantswho deal in such stolen property,'' he said.   In his 86-page ruling Thursday, Noland said Ms. Goldberg neverobtained title to the mosaics, which she bought for $1.1 millionlast summer in Switzerland.   Ms. Goldberg had the mosaics restored last year at anIndianapolis museum.   The mosaics, which date to 530 A.D., depict Jesus as a youngboy, the apostles James and Matthew and an archangel. They wereoriginally part of a larger mosaic on the ceiling of the Church ofthe Panagia Kanakaria.   The Cypriots learned the whereabouts of the mosaics in January,when Ms. Goldberg offered them to the J. Paul Getty Museum inMalibu, Calif., for $20 million.   The Republic of Cyprus and the Autocephalous Greek OrthodoxChurch of Cyprus sued Ms. Goldberg and her art dealership, Goldbergand Feldman Fine Arts of Carmel, in March to recover the mosaics.The trial began May 30 and lasted six days.</TEXT></DOC>
