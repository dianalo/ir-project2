Clinking beer mugs, darts hitting a board and an occasional fiston the table are the only sounds. The banter is carried on withfluttering hands and a tap on the wrist by the dozens of deaf andhearing impaired who make this Back Bay neighborhood bar their ownonce a week.   ``Deaf is a small world,'' Laurie Szynal, of Fall River, saidthrough a signing interpreter. ``Where else do you go to meet deafpeople and socialize?''   The Thursday night gang at Crossroads has grown from a fewfriends a few years ago to capacity crowds of 150 to 300 peoplefrom all over New England who gather each Thursday in thecomfortable, collegiate atmosphere for conversation and camaraderie.   Visitors to the city also stop by, including students fromGallaudet University in Washington, D.C., the nation's onlyuniversity for the hearing impaired.   The regulars say it's their only alternative to deaf clubs,which cater to older crowds with bingo games and bridge.   One cold Thursday night in November, patrons gathered with aninterpreter around the end of the bar and told how important thegathering is to the young deaf community. It's a time when everyonein the bar speaks their language.   Brent Jolley, one of the group's founder, now works behind thebar on Thursday, giving signers an advantage any thirsty soul whoever called to a barkeep can appreciate.   ``I can take an order across the room and by the time you get tothe bar I can have it ready,'' Jolley said.   When Sabrina Dennison, a 21-year-old from Portsmouth, N.H.,tells her hearing friends she's going to a Boston bar, they thinkof getting all dolled up to dance and flirt.   ``That's not the point here,'' she said. ``It's to meet oldfriends and deaf people. I just dress anyway I feel.''   The group comes from all walks of life. Ron Harrison works withthe mentally retarded; Szynal is a graduate of Newbury College inBrookline who is interested in fashion design; Jolley works for theLegislature; Charlie Mokotoff teaches at Northeastern University inBoston; Dennison is an actress.   Hearing people are welcome, and if someone knows how to signthey can ususally join any of the highly visible conversations.   ``It's special here because the deaf and the hearing and thehearing impaired all have a chance to mix,'' Harrison said.   The jukebox occasionally kicks on when a hearing person drops ina quarter; around the room the conversation goes on uninterrupted.   Some hearing people who unwittingly stumble upon the group,however, find it ``hard to understand deaf culture,'' said JoeCardillo, who is deaf.   Some take offense, for example, when the deaf pound a table orstamp on the floor, sending out vibrations to get the attention ofanother deaf person.   ``Hearing can call you and get your attention. Hearing thinksthe pounding is a stupid thing to do,'' Cardillo said. ``It's myway. I have to do it that way to get people's attention.''   Many hearing people learning to sign at nearby universities stopby to find patient conversation partners, and maybe even learn afew deaf jokes.   ``You learn better here talking to deaf people because its morenatural,'' said Peter Hawker of Medford, who learned to sign tocommunicate with his deaf brother. ``After they see you're someonelearning to sign, these guys will turn around, shake your hand andinvite you in.''   Sign language's special syntax gives the deaf their own brand ofhumor and a repertoire of jokes not easily related to the hearingworld.   But the deaf have an advantage in a pastime as old as barrooms _eavesdropping.   ``Sure,'' Mokotoff said, jumping up on a chair and lookingacross the room. ``Want to know what they're saying at that tableover there?''</TEXT></DOC>
