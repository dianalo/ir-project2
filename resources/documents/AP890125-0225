DimitryYazov has given a breakdown of troops to be withdrawn from Hungaryover the next two years as part of a unilateral Soviet troopreduction plan, media reported Wednesday.   In Geneva, the Soviet senior arms expert said Moscow will seekearly progress at Vienna talks on reducing conventional forces inEurope that are due to start in March.   Yazov detailed the withdrawal figures in a letter to HungarianDefense Minister Ferenc Karpati, saying the first stage to becompleted by July will include one armoured division and an armouredtraining regiment, the official news agency MTI reported.   However, Karpati gave no exact date for the start of thewithdrawal and MTI said the Hungarian defense minister refused tosay how many troops are to leave in the three-stage pullout.   He said the Kremlin would publish a detailed timetable on whatforces would be removed and when by the end of this month.   There are an estimated 62,000 Soviet troops stationed in Hungaryand Karpati and other officials have said about one fourth of themare to be withdrawn under the Kremlin plan.   The withdrawals are part of a unilateral move announced inDecember by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to remove some50,000 troops from Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia as wellas 5,000 tanks by 1990.   The gesture was intended to give impetus to the March talks inVienna.   Karpati said Yazov's schedule foresaw the withdrawal of anairborne assault battalion and a fighter plane regiment fromHungarian territory in the second half of this year.   In 1990, a chemical defense battalion and the staff of a trainingschool for non-commissioned officers in eastern Hungary would bewithdrawn, MTI quoted Karpati as saying.   In Geneva, Victor Karpov, Soviet deputy foreign minister andsenior arms control expert, suggested the scheduled Vienna talksstand a better chance of success than their failed predecessor, theMutual Balanced Force Reduction Talks launched in the early 1970s.   ``We are going to participate in those talks open-mindedly,''Karpov said of the conference, due to start March 9 with 23 nationsfrom East and West.   He said Moscow intends to ``help from the very start to negotiatesolutions that can bring in a very short period of time realreductions,'' with elimination of imbalances between the two camps'military power in Europe as first priority.   He added the Soviets are ``not rigid'' on the issue ofverification and ``will be ready to discuss various possibilities.''   Karpov was in Geneva to lead a Soviet delegation to a U.N.disarmament workshop.   The official Czechoslovak news agency CTK reported Wednesday thatthe Warsaw Pact is to hold annual military exercises inCzechoslovakia in the first half of February.   The Hungarian news agency MTI reported that the exercises,code-named ``Friendship '89'' will involve the Hungarian andCzechoslovak armies as well as Soviet forces stationed inCzechoslovakia.   Neither news agency gave an exact date for the exercise.</TEXT></DOC>
