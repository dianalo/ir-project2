The proposal could throw a monkeywrench into PacifiCorp's $1.82 billion offer for PinnacleWest.   Salt River Project, Arizona's second-largest electricutility, proposed to pay as much as $500 million for certaindistribution and transmission facilities in the sprawlingPhoenix area. Arizona Public Service, the largest electricutility in the state, serves the central parts of Phoenix andother nearby cities; Salt River serves the surrounding area.Under the Salt River proposal, roughly 166,000 customers ofArizona Public Service would become customers of Salt River.</LP><TEXT>   The Salt River proposal came just one day after PinnacleWest received a sweetened $1.82 billion acquisition offer forthe whole company from PacifiCorp, a Portland, Ore., utilitythat has operations in seven states. Analysts said thePacifiCorp offer would be hard to resist.   But Salt River's proposal, apart from any financialconsiderations, is a political wild card because it includesa promise to freeze residential electricity rates for up toseven years.   &quot;By serving our customers in more logical, contiguousareas, we should be able to keep utility costs down andimprove service,&quot; said Jack Pfister, Salt River's generalmanager. He said that Salt River's proposal, even though itcovers some of the oldest, highest-revenue producing parts ofArizona Public Service's territory, shouldn't necessarilypreclude a sale of the rest of Pinnacle to PacifiCorp.   Richard Snell, Pinnacle's chairman, reacted coolly to SaltRiver's proposal. &quot;I don't know why we would want to do this,but we'll take a look at it.&quot; Mr. Snell said there were&quot;working meetings with financial advisors&quot; over the weekendto study both proposals. The Phoenix company's annual meetingis Wednesday.   Both Mr. Snell and Mr. Pfister denied that the Salt Riverproposal was engineered as a more palatable alternative toPacifiCorp's offer. Mr. Snell has said repeatedly that hedoesn't think this is the time to sell Pinnacle, which isrecovering from deep financial problems brought on by afailed diversification strategy.   A PacifiCorp spokesman said the company &quot;hasn't done anyanalysis and we don't know yet what {the Salt River proposal}means.&quot; PacifiCorp's $21-a-share offer drops conditions thatmade it easier for Pinnacle to reject its three previousoffers.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,Pinnacle shares rose 12.5 cents to $16.50 on turnover of morethan two million shares. PacifiCorp shares closed at $22.25,unchanged. The Salt River proposal came after the close oftrading.   Salt River said it would pay 150% of book value for theservice areas, minus depreciation and amortization, up to$500 million. Salt River estimates that the areas have a bookvalue of between $350 million and $380 million. PacifiCorp'sbid represents a &quot;a little less than book value,&quot; Mr. Pfistersaid. But he acknowledged that the proposals aren't directlycomparable. Salt River also said it would agree to purchasepower for the areas from Arizona Public Service at an&quot;attractive rate&quot; for 20 years.   Seeking customer support in the Arizona Public Serviceservice areas, Salt River has proposed a rate freeze there.Arizona Public Service residential rates are now about 15%higher than Salt River rates. If Salt River's proposal isaccepted, it promised that rates in the Arizona PublicService areas wouldn't be raised, except to cover fueladjustments, until Salt River residential rates catch up inabout seven years.   Late last week, PacifiCorp began running full-page ads inArizona newspapers highlighting its promise to limitelectricity price increases to 2% a year for the next fouryears. Arizona Public Service had asked regulators for 6.5%annual increases for three years beginning in 1991.   The Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and PowerDistrict isn't subject to regulation of the ArizonaCorporation Commission. Thus when the Salt River boardapproved an average 7.9% rate rise last month for itsresidential customers, its seventh rate increase since 1979,no further action or review was necessary. Residential usersaccount for about 470,000 of the utility's 520,000 customers.Arizona Public Service has a total of about 593,000customers.   After enjoying a booming business for decades, Salt Riverhas reduced projections for customer expansion because ofslowing growth of the Arizona economy. Salt River said thatif its bid is successful, it would end Salt River'sobligation to compensate some Arizona Public Servicecustomers who live within Salt River's waterservice area.More than 50 years ago, a change in the Salt River bylawsthat has since been modified required the utility to payhomeowners the difference between Salt River and ArizonaPublic Service electric bills if the Arizona Public Servicebills are at least 15% higher. In 1987, Salt River paid out$3.2 million to 13,100 Arizona Public Service customers andthe following year paid $2.6 million to 9,500 customers.</TEXT></DOC>
