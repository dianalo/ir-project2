For all the bombast and the rhetoric, there's somethinginherently goofy about politics, and the closer we get toelection time, the goofier it gets. From Bill &quot;hankypanky&quot;Clinton to Pat Buchanan, the talkshow candidate (with hisV.P. Rush Limbaugh), to the new Dan &quot;he's serious now --really -- we mean it&quot; Quayle, politicians sometimes seem toexist just to provide fodder for standup comedians.</LP><TEXT>   Recently, TV comedy has been having its way withWashington. The latest is an animated half-hour series called&quot;Capitol Critters&quot; (ABC, Saturdays, 8 p.m. EST), a programthat shows what's really happening in the seamy underbelly ofour nation's capitol. We're not talking about thecongressional cloakroom here. We're talking about a cartoonworld that exists behind the walls and under the floors ofthe Oval Office, a world of rats and mice and cockroachesthat parallels our own.   Max, an innocent young Midwestern farm mouse (voice byNeil Patrick Harris, star of &quot;Doogie Howser&quot;), is orphanedwhen exterminators kill off his entire family. He decides toleave Nebraska and journey to Washington, where his activistcousin Berkeley (Jennifer Darling) lives in the cellarsbeneath the White House.   There Max is befriended by a streetwise teenager, Jammet(Charlie Adler), his mom, Trixie (Patti Deutsch), a cooldowntown roach, Moze (Dorian Harewood), and Muggle, a lab ratwho's still strung out on all the chemicals he ingested. Asvoiced by Bobcat Goldthwait, Muggle gets many of the bestlines: &quot;William Howard Taft? He was so fat, he fell throughhis party's platform.&quot;   Week by week, Max and his friends get into a series ofadventures as they go hunting for food and try to avoid theWhite House cats. In one episode, when a young mouse iskilled, Jammet retrieves a revolver, and with the help ofseveral compatriots sets off to stalk the cat responsible.&quot;Let's blow his frigging brains out,&quot; they snicker. But thegood-hearted Max steps in. &quot;They're cats. They're supposed tochase us, and we're supposed to run. You can't just shootone. You'd be messing with nature. You don't want to pullthat trigger any more than I do.&quot;   &quot;Capitol Critters&quot; is a Steven Bochco production (&quot;HillStreet Blues,&quot; &quot;L.A. Law&quot;), and we tend to expect more thanschmaltz from Mr. Bochco, even in a cartoon. But asco-created by Nat Mauldin, and produced at the Hanna-BarberaStudios, this is real old-fashioned stuff. Despite theoccasional incisive or satiric line (&quot;Too bad the last guyleft,&quot; says Jammet. &quot;All he ever did in here was sleep&quot;), theshow still verges on the cornball.   In another scene, Max is crushed when an upstandingcongressman turns out to be on the take. &quot;Everybody's justtrying to figure out the best scam,&quot; he says. &quot;You know whogets shafted? The people. . . . I'm never gonna trust anyonein government ever again.&quot; But when his friend takes him tosee a statue of Abraham Lincoln, he realizes that democracyis OK after all, and the music reaches a final crescendo.   It's hard to figure out who the audience is supposed to befor this show. Playing in prime time, it has a preachinessthat doesn't seem geared either to adults, or even the kidswho go for &quot;The Simpsons.&quot; Even the animation isn't daring,especially after the incredible inventiveness of a show likeMTV's &quot;Liquid Television.&quot;   Neither hip nor irreverent, &quot;Capitol Critters&quot; is just thestory of a goody two-shoes rodent. As for me, I prefer RalphBakshi's Saturday-morning efforts: Mighty Mouse, come home.   ---   Meanwhile, around the dial, cable's Comedy Central waszeroing in on the real White House last week. After muchbrouhaha and the threat of lawsuits back and forth, the Bushadministration and the networks finally allowed ComedyCentral to cablecast a live feed of the president's speech intheir &quot;State of the Union -- Undressed.&quot;   The premise was simple: &quot;Why yell half-baked disapprovalsat your TV set when you can watch highly paid professionalsdo it for you?&quot; And so Comedy Central offered up its ownlow-rent Rathers -- Al Franken and Billy Kimballanchors who(in the best tradition of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;)volunteered running commentary around, in between and on topof the president's speech, all in the name of good, cleanpolitical fun.   &quot;What are you looking for in tonight's speech?&quot; asked Mr.Kimball. &quot;Basically,&quot; said Mr. Franken, &quot;I guess I'm lookingfor . . . an apology. The president promised to create 30million new jobs in 1988. So far, he's short by . . .approximately 30 million.&quot;   &quot;You're neglecting that the president created two jobs:yours and mine here tonight,&quot; said Mr. Kimball to Mr.Franken.   Much of the evening also was spent discussing charts andgraphs of key statistics (&quot;number of times Bush quoted YogiBerra&quot;). While a few of the deadpan lines were real zingers,much of the program was funnier in the idea than theexecution, which is always the risk with live humor. Thentoo, Mr. Bush upstaged them with a few one-liners of his own:&quot;The speaker and the vice president are laughing. They sawwhat I did in Japan. They're just happy they're sittingbehind me.&quot;   The commentators who convened afterward pointed out thatthe president had missed a real opportunity by failing tomention Franklin Pierce anywhere in his speech. He did,however, mention Elvis, which -- they all agreed -- is sureto stand him in good stead come November.</TEXT></DOC>
