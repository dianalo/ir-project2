BrowningStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROPAEROSPACE (ARO)TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   New engine problems are further delaying plans to restart the European Space Agency's program of Ariane rocket launches.    The fresh delays mean that both major Western commercial space programs, Ariane and the U.S. space shuttle, remain out of service.    Ariane officials who in December had talked of seven launches this year now say they aren't any longer sure that they will get in five. The new problem, according to a spokesman for the space agency's commercial satellite launching arm, Arianespace, is overheating in the pump system that supplies fuel to the engine.    The spokesman said Arianespace has solved the original problem with the ignition system, which had delayed launches since an engine failed last May. But when the company started testing a new ignition system, designed to replace the faulty one, the overheating developed.    Because customers think Ariane will be back in service before the space shuttle, orders are continuing to back up at the European launch concern. But the grounding is expensive for Arianespace.    Officials estimated that the initial 11-month suspension cost the company the equivalent of $82 million, and the continued delays will push up that figure. What's more, the two-year program to overhaul the rocket's problem-plagued third stage is likely to cost Arianespace as much as $163.6 million, according to the chairman, Frederic d'Allest.    Despite the problems, Arianespace has received at least nine new orders since the launch program was suspended. In January, it signed a contract to launch an Italian telecommunications satellite in mid-1990. That brought its orders outstanding to 41 satellites, valued at about $2.13 billion.    After the U.S. space shuttle Challenger exploded in January 1986, Ariane received much of the resulting unmet demand. As the only other major commercial launcher in the West, Arianespace holds a virtual monopoly on the market until the space shuttle program gets back on track.    The new problem with Ariane isn't as severe as the original problem of ignition failure, the spokesman said, but it needs to be fixed before the program starts again.    &quot;It is a bit as if the red warning light comes on in your car,&quot; he explained. &quot;The car will still run, but you want to have it fixed before you make an important trip.&quot;    In December, Arianespace announced that it wouldn't be resuming launches in February as once was planned. Officials said then that they hoped to start again by March or April, which would have meant seven launches this year instead of the eight originally planned.    They later pushed the date back to June, and talked of five launches. Now they say they don't know how many launches to expect this year. </TEXT></DOC>
