The meeting, arranged by the Swedish government, took place aweek before Arafat is to address the U.N. General Assembly inGeneva. The assembly decided to move its session from New York tothe European U.N. headquarters when the United States refused Arafata visa.   A Swedish government statement after the meeting said ``majorissues were addressed and important progress was made.'' Whenreporters asked Arafat about the results of the meeting, he replied:``It is better to wait and see.''   Mounted police sealed off the snow-covered park around the HagaPalace, where Arafat and aides conferred with the five-member Jewishdelegation from the United States.   Foreign Minister Sten Andersson was in the 18th century buildingfor the first hour of the meeting, then left and returned two hourslater for the end.   Ingvar Carlsson, the prime minister, cut short a trip to Paris toreturn home and act as host at a dinner for the two delegations.   He greeted Arafat with an embrace after the meeting and receivedthe Jewish group at his office 40 minutes later. None of thedelegation members commented to reporters.   Rita Hauser led the Jewish group. She is chairman of the U.S.branch of the International Center for Peace in the Middle East, acoalition of leftist organizations in Israel and other countries.   Abba Eban, former Israeli foreign minister, is internationalchairman of the center. Its Israeli branch includes prominentmembers of the center-left Labor Party of Foreign Minister ShimonPeres, to which Eban belongs.   The center believes Israel should give up at least some of theArab territory captured in the 1967 Middle East war and many of itsmembers urge the Israeli government to deal directly with thePalestine Liberation Organization.   Israel and several Jewish organizations protested the meeting.The Israeli Foreign Ministry lodged an official protest with theSwedish ambassador.   An Israeli source said privately a message was sent to oneparticipant, Menachem Rosensaft of the Labor Zionist Alliance, byhis group's parent organization ordering him to resign all officialpositions.   Sweden's Foreign Ministry described the delegation members as``prominent personalities'' representing a significant portion ofU.S. Jewish opinion, but an Israeli diplomat in Stockholm dismissedthem as ``unimportant.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.   Benjamin Cohen, president of the American Zionist Federation,issued a statement in New York saying, ``The Americans who are atthe meeting are participating for their own benefit, without thesupport of any recognized organization in the Jewish community.''   Israeli refuses to deal with the PLO and has made it a criminaloffense for any Israeli citizen to do so. It has urged Israel's U.S.supporters to abstain from contacts with an organization itdescribes as a band of terrorists.   Other members of the Jewish delegation were Drora Kass, thecenter's executive director; Stanley Sheinbaum, an economist andpublisher from Los Angeles, and Avraham Udovitch, chairman of thedepartment for Near East Studies at Princeton University.   Arafat's delegation included Mahmoud Darwish and YasserAbed-Rabbo, both members of the PLO executive committee; hisspokesman Bassam Abu Sharif, and Akram Haniah, a former journalistexpelled by Israel last year.   Ministry officials said Andersson spent months arranging themeeting. The newspaper Aftonbladet called it a personal triumph forthe foreign minister.   Sweden said it was a way to ``contribute to the peace process inthe Middle East.''   Andersson has urged Israel to respond to what he called ``thehistoric decisions'' announced Nov. 15 in Algiers, when the PLOaccepted U.N. resolutions that recognize Israel.   Carlsson told reporters before leaving Paris, in an apparentreference to the PLO and Israel: ``If a dialogue can be startedbetween the two parties, it would be a major breakthrough.''</TEXT></DOC>
