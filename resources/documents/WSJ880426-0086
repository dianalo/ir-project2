However, there remains the basis at talks beginning today for a limited accord between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-OPEC producers to hold oil output at current levels or to reduce it by 500,000 barrels a day. Such a cut, covering about 2% of the countries' output, could suffice to keep oil prices firm in the expected weak second quarter.    A major stumbling block to the formation of a cartel is dissension among OPEC members over the need for production cuts. Other hindrances to a united effort to trim the world oil glut are the absence of any observers from the Soviet Union, the world's biggest oil producer, and indications from some of the participating non-OPEC countries that they cannot afford to reduce their production by any substantial amounts.    Many in OPEC still haven't given up, however, on an eventual coalition of exporters that would adjust production as demand rises and falls. A senior OPEC official said that the unprecedented meeting here is itself &quot;a significant achievement -- the most important since the founding&quot; of OPEC in 1960.    As previously reported, the joint meeting of seven non-OPEC producers and six OPEC members signals the first major attempt at a world-wide alliance of petroleum producers to prop up the price of oil. &quot;Any step at all where all parties can do something positive is very important, especially at this stage, when we are in a situation where prices are weak,&quot; said Subroto, the former Indonesian oil minister who is currently an adviser to the president of Indonesia. &quot;Both parties are eager to do something.&quot;    Yesterday, both sides were making final preparations for the formal meetings. After numerous consultations among themselves, the non-OPEC countries, which initiated the idea of shared production cuts, will present their proposal to OPEC at a joint session tonight. Until now, the real lobbying for such an effort has come from Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, Venezuela's oil minister. &quot;This is Hernandez Grisanti's baby,&quot; said a senior OPEC official. &quot;He convinced Colombia, which had been reticent about attending the talks, to come.&quot;    But the Venezuelan minister hasn't convinced all the other OPEC ministers that a production cut could be beneficial. He has angered some of them, in fact, with his fervent campaigning.    &quot;In OPEC, you most clearly have extremists,&quot; said one delegate yesterday. &quot;Algeria is ready to cut everything. On the other hand is Saudi Arabia, which does not want to cut anything. In the middle are Indonesia, Nigeria and Venezuela, which will try to arrange an understanding.&quot;    Most of the OPEC ministers arriving yesterday were reluctant to predict the outcome of the talks until they learned more about the positions of the non-OPEC group. &quot;I have nothing to say. We'll see,&quot; said Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister.    The OPEC ministers will hold a strategy session this morning before meeting with representatives of the seven non-OPEC producers tonight. Some speculate that Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's minister and OPEC president, will lead the talks for OPEC, while Mexico's energy minister, Fernando Hiriart, may head the non-OPEC group.    Mr. Hiriart told reporters that Mexico is willing to cut its exports 5%, but only if everybody else agrees. &quot;It might be difficult to reach unanimity, but we expect a substantial number of countries to do something similar,&quot; he said.    Texas Railroad Commissioner Kent Hance said that &quot;under the right conditions, 5% could look attractive&quot; even for some U.S. producers. One of three members of the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the oil industry in that state, Mr. Hance is here as an observer. Today, he expects to meet separately with OPEC member Venezuela and non-OPEC producers Mexico, Egypt and Oman to &quot;open a dialogue.&quot; He might attend tonight's meeting as well.    A 5% cut in exports would take considerably less oil off world markets than if it were applied to total production. Mexico, for example, produces 2.6 million barrels a day, of which it exports less than half. OPEC members export three-fourths of the oil they produce.    This points up one major area of debate that is already surfacing before the talks begin. The OPEC members willing to discuss actual production cuts are calling for barrel-for-barrel reductions with the non-OPEC group. Thus, a total cutback of 500,000 barrels a day -- the most likely figure if agreement on shared reductions is reached -- would be split 50-50 between the two groups of oil exporters. </TEXT></DOC>
