yesterday to put &quot;users in a position to extend andexploit the IT platform of the future&quot;.andP;  IBM finds the idea that themainframe must give way to the mini and micro slightly ludicrous (no vestedinterest, of course) because: we are entering the multimedia era when datawill become increasingly complex to manage; applications are becoming morenumeric intensive; and global networks need to be managed.andP;  These were allareas addressed to a greater or lesser extent in IBM's software announcementswhich accompanied the launch of its ES/9000 family.andM;IBM reveals open plan for databases, SystemandM;View to bring systems management into SAAOne of the more significant softwareannouncements was that of SystemView which is a systems managementarchitecture.andP;  Its existence has been discussed before when it was believedto be called HostView (CI No 1,487).andP;  The idea basically seems to be that IBMwants to standardise systems management around its SAA concept.andP;  Interfacesto applications are to be based on Common User Access and will have an openlydefined structure for integration and navigation between system managementfunctions.andP;  For example, there will be a data model for setting a standardmethod for describing data.andP;  A single database will hold the topology ofvarious systems and all systems will access it.andP;  However, IBM says that it nolonger thinks of the database in terms of a particular product such as DB2,but rather as a means to co-ordinate software development.andP;  Consequently, itwelcomes the development of SAA-compliant databases by other vendors: puttingits enhancements where its mouth is, the company has a new level of DatabaseInterface with further support for ANSI and ISO standards; while the CommonProgramming Interface level for the Database Interface includes referentialintegrity, common SQL return codes and a PL/1 interface.andP;  Meanwhile, newreleases of DB2 and SQL/DS along with a new version of Query ManagementFacility support distributed database management capability between DB2 andSQL/DS as well as connecting IMS to DB2.andP;  The new Query Management Facilityalso extends SAA Query Interface to CICS in MVS and enables users to queryRepository Manager/MVS.andP;  At present SystemView translates into two productannouncements: SAA Asset Manager/MVS and SAA Delivery Manager.andP;  The first ofthese is described as defining and automating enterprise business proceduresvia a process manager, supplying an open database definition and providingbusiness management applications.andP;  Delivery Manager, on the other hand, is anapplication enabling programs and files from an MVS or VM host to becustomised and controlled by OS/2 programmable workstations.andP;  Despite muchconjecture that Repository Manager might find itself resident somewhere otherthan on the mainframe, no such announcement was forthcoming yesterday.andO;However, there is a new release of Repository Manager/MVS which enablesprogrammers on workstations running OS/2 Extended 1.2 to access hostrepository services through a remote interface.andP;  All of which continues toleave Micro Focus free to offer serious workstation programming developmentvia its Cobol WorkBench.andP;  When it comes to transaction processing newreleases of IMS/ESA and CICS/ESA support the SAA communications Interface,while IMS/ESA also supports the Resource Recovery Interface.andP;  This interfaceis new and defines services that enable the use of two-phase commitmentcontrol support.andP;  Using this interface changes can be made simultaneously tomultiple date resources or not at all.andP;  IBM also claimed to increase theemphasis on the role of the AS/400 within AD/Cycle - this appeared to referto an enhanced Software Analysis Test Tool supporting RPG/400, C/400,Cobol/400 and C/370 languages.andP;  The RS/6000 was not mentioned once, butappears to be embraced by SystemView.andM;Three new operating systems for ESA/390andM;As was to be expected IBM announced ESA/390 operating systems to accompanythe launch of the ES/9000 processors - these are: MVS/ESA SP Version 4, whichIBM claims runs on all models, and is available next month; VSE/ESA version 1for entry level models 120 through to the intermediate 480 which ships inDecember; and VM/ESA out in March, for guest operating systems andinteractive system environments.andP;  The new MVS has sysplex functionality whichmeans that it can manage up to eight MVS/ESA systems as a single system -this, however, does not mean that users get to pay for one licence.andP;  TheSysplex Timer synchronises the clocks on multiple MVS systems when theyreside on different processors, while the cross-system coupling facilityprovides facilities to enable programs to communicate, as well as monitorstatus and signal information across MVS system images.andP;  MVS/ESA also offersthe ability for users to add or delete I/O devices without incurring systemdowntime.andP;  Co-operative processing within SAA has been enhanced on MVS viaApplication Program-to-Program Communications.andP;  VSE/ESA is a mutant operatingsystem, neither fully SAA-compliant, nor is it an alien non-SAA beast.andP;  Itoffers 384Mb of real storage, 256Mb virtual storage with up to 16Mb for anyone address space.andP;  VSE/ESA adds up to 200 dynamic partitions with separateaddress spaces.andP;  The release appears to signal IBM's desire to get VSE usersonto MVS - the two operating systems share CICS, VTAM, Cobol II and CrossSystem Product as well as an SQL interface which is implemented in SQL/DS andDB2.andP;  However SAA Programme Manager, Muriel Jones says that VSE &quot;participatesin&quot;, &quot;is a guest in&quot; SAA and that IBM will be providing certain interfacesbut not others.andP;  At which point VM/ESA enters the picture, since, forexample, VSE-users would access OfficeVision running on a server with VM/ESA.andO;The latter operating system has a &quot;data in memory&quot; capability giving fasterdata access, Data Spaces offering &quot;virtually unlimited addressability&quot; on theES/9000 processor and improved system managment via storage managementautomation.andM;SCO ForumandM;The iBCS standard puts Santa Cruz Operation in the driving seatandM;for Unix on Intel kitandM;Speaking at SCO Forum held at the University of California Santa Cruz campuslate last month, Ron Whittier, Intel Corp vice-president of marketingintroduced the iBCS Intel Binary Compatibility Standard Edition 2 for Unixapplications on 80386 and 80486 microprocessors, saying &quot;We are doing fivethings with this announcement.andP;  ATandamp;T, Santa Cruz and Unix System Laboratorieshave agreed to fix the incompatibilities that have crept into System V.3.2implementations.andP;  We will define and extend a standard for binaryapplications.andP;  Santa Cruz and ATandamp;T will provide conformant operating systemswhile Intel will publish the specification and test suites to measurecompatibility to the standard.andP;  Intel will act as an interface to an openprocess that will maintain the spec over time.&quot; Under questioning, Whittieradmitted that the details of the open process had yet to be worked out.andO;&quot;There's little need for negotiating - iBCS2 is about codifying the standardsexisting in currently applications.&quot; This was amplified by Larry Dooling,president of Unix System Laboratories &quot;Today's applications will besupported.andP;  No one has to worry about applications now on the shelf orcurrently under development.&quot;andM;Santa Cruz holds System V.4 commitment - Intel's in-house UnixandM;effort in doubtandM;While Intel and Unix System Laboratories representatives spokeenthusiastically about the implications of iBCS2 for Unix System V.4, SantaCruz's Doug Michels would not be drawn into committing Santa Cruz to V.4.andO;&quot;We are currently shipping V.3.2 and are improving V.3.2 for later releases.andO;As a member of both the Open Software Foundation and Unix International, weare in a position to select the best technology at a later date for ourcustomers.&quot; iBCS2 plays strongly into Santa Cruz's hands.andP;  Basing thestandard on the applications now in the field amounts to a tacit endorsementof Santa Cruz's operating system and applications because of their dominancein the Intel Unix market.andP;  This announcement was also a climb-down for Intel,which announced its intention to become a Unix operating system vendor lastOctober when it announced the iABI at new York's Unix Expo.andP;  Sources close toIntel reveal that the development team responsible for Intel Unix has nowbeen disbanded and dispersed to other areas in the company, although Whittierconfusingly insisted that the new announcement would not &quot;decommit&quot; Intelfrom the Unix development work announced at Unix Expo.andP;  An earlier attempt toput together something similar took place in 1988, when ATandamp;T and Intelproduced the Intel Binary Compatibility Standard Edition 1 but by the timethey got it to market it was outdated.andP;  IBCS left some critical blanks, suchas Posix, X/Open compliance, X Window and networking interfacing - mostlybecause they hadn't been invented yet.andP;  There was also no process in place toprevent divergence from the written standard.andP;  This time, they are tryingagain with Santa Cruz included.andP;  The first meeting of the working groupputting the spec together is tomorrow, September 5.andP;  It will be chaired byIntel Fellow Dr Richard Wort and apparently will include only two technicianseach from Unix System Laboratories, Santa Cruz, Interactive Systems andIntel.andP;  They want to have a draft by the fourth quarter and have a completiontarget of the first quarter - worst case first half - of 1991 for the finaldocument.andP;  The companies declined to put a dollar value on their work, butmost of the investment will be from Intel, which is going to develop andpublish the thing and come up with a testing suite.andP;  According to thecompanies, applications developers will not have to go back and re-writetheir applications - the operating system will make all the necessaryadditions.andP;  The spec will conform to XPG3, IEEE Posix 1003.1 and FIPS 151-1.andO;Related work is also going on with Intel's 80860 RISC, but this is notincluded in the deal.andM;Software Foundation, Unix International agree on Intel market -andM;bar interfaceandM;There seems to be little contention between the Open Software Foundation andUnix International in the Intel Unix market.andP;  Taking the lead from ATandamp;T'sUnix System V.4, the Foundation announced in May 1990 its intention to buildXenix and Unix System V.3.2 compatibility into OSF/1 with Santa Cruz's help.andO;Both Foundation president David Tory and Unix International's PeterCunningham welcomed the new announcements.andP;  However, the graphical userinterface area was good for rise out of ATandamp;T's Larry Dooling.andP;  Whileasserting the technical and market dominance of Open Look (which raised a feweyebrows among his audience), he allowed that there didn't need to be awinner or loser in the user interface battle.andP;  These statements could be readas paving the way for a graceful retreat on Open Look - &quot;the market willdecide&quot; said Dooling.andP;  Santa Cruz's Michels felt that the scrap was over barthe mopping up, with OSF/Motif (used in Santa Cruz's Open Desktop package)the victor.andP;  The iBSC2 spec will not include a graphical user interface.andM;and the best of the restandM;UK windowing specialist JSB Ltd released JSB Multiview DeskTop Release 1.2 atthe Santa Cruz Forum on Thursday.andP;  The Microsoft Windows 3.0-based softwarefor MS-DOS systems provides a graphical user interface for integratingpersonal computers with Unix systems via RS-232 or local area network.andO;Available this month, the new release costs $300 for a one user license,$1,000 for five users or $1,800 for 10 users: updates for current users willbe available from Santa Cruz.andP;  The first wave of third party applications forSanta Cruz's Open Desktop graphical operating system package are at lastcoming on stream, and at Santa Cruz Forum packages on show included: theFrameMaker publishing system from Frame Technology Inc running on an Altos5000 server; Island Graphic's Write, Paint and Draw applications; Crosswind'sSynchronize multi-user time management software; the Uniplex officeautomation suite; and Informix's Wingz advanced spreadsheet.andP;  Other promisedproducts include the Wang Clearview and WordPerfect word processors; packagesfrom CAD Solutions, Cognition and Digital Matrix; and development tools fromFocus and Ingres.andP;  And Santa Cruz said that the first customer shipments ofthe Open Desktop Server Upgrade supplement to its Open Desktop package havebegun: the supplement adds server capabilities to Open Desktop for PCInterface and networked SQL databases, including a multi-user licence for allOpen Desktop system services so that multi-user systems using X terminals,character-based terminals or networked stations to be set up.andP;  Available now,it's $1,500: Open Desktop is $1,000.andP;  - Paul Lavin, Maureen O'Gara</TEXT></DOC>
