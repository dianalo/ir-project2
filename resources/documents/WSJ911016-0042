The Oscar judges, he joked, were faced with&quot;Awakenings,&quot; a film about someone coming out of a coma;&quot;Reversal of Fortune,&quot; a film about someone going into acoma; and Orion's &quot;Dances With Wolves,&quot; a film made by astudio in a coma.   Judging by this summer's dismal box-office receipts, muchof Hollywood borders on comatose this year. But no studioappears to be closer to death's door than Orion Pictures, asmall, publicly traded company beloved among many Americanfilm makers for high-quality pictures and low levels ofcorporate interference.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;These were the Medicis of the movie business,&quot; lamentsone young producer, Ron Rotholz, whose Orion film &quot;State ofGrace&quot; won critical but not financial success.   Indeed, Arthur B. Krim and the rest of the management teamthat founded Orion in 1982 have a history of backingwonderful films, sometimes against long odds. Starting in1951, when they rescued and ran what was left of UnitedArtists, they have brought audiences such classics as &quot;WestSide Story,&quot; &quot;Some Like It Hot,&quot; the James Bond and PinkPanther movies, &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; Amark of their creative gambling is that all three of Orion'sbest-picture Oscars -- &quot;Amadeus,&quot; &quot;Platoon&quot; and &quot;Dances WithWolves,&quot; which it distributed -- were first rejected by othermajor studios.   &quot;Orion doesn't just feel like a different place from theother studios, it is a different place,&quot; says Jonathan Demme,whose hip but commercial films &quot;Married to the Mob&quot; and&quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; have made him a hot commodity inHollywood. If Orion folds, says Susan Seidelman, director of&quot;Desperately Seeking Susan,&quot; a 1985 movie that starredMadonna, &quot;it will leave a real void. It's the only studiothat bridges the gap between the artistic freedom of anindependent and the viable financing of a major studio.&quot;   Despite the company's vaunted reputation and recentsuccesses, however, Orion continues in a financial free-fall.After stock trading closed yesterday, the company announcedthat it expects to report a &quot;substantial&quot; loss for the fiscalsecond quarter ended Aug. 31, and that it is negotiating foran extension of the payment dates on $52 million in motionpicture production financing obligations due last week andyesterday.   Previously, the company defaulted on loan payments ofnearly $70 million. It carries a staggering burden of some$550 million in long-term debt, about half of which it hopesto swap for equity in a restructuring plan to avoid abankruptcy filing, a restructuring that has been agreed uponin principle with its bondholders.   Equally humiliating, last spring, in a desperate bid forcash, Orion was forced into the unheard-of position of tryingto sell to rivals four partly finished film projects -- onlyone of which, &quot;The Addams Family,&quot; fetched an acceptableprice. Then this summer the studio watched helplessly as oneof its most celebrated and loyal film makers, Woody Allen,defected, at least temporarily, to a rival studio becauseOrion couldn't finance the scheduled November production ofhis next film.   In the past year Orion's stock has plunged from above $15to below $2 last week. This week it has rallied sharply.Yesterday, in trading before the announcement of an expectedsecond-quarter loss, Orion closed at $4.50 on the New YorkStock Exchange. Some analysts described the action as a&quot;short squeeze&quot; -- buying by traders who had earlier soldborrowed shares on the expectation of a declining shareprice.   Hollywood loves a good mystery, and the question of who --or what -- has all but killed Orion is no exception,particularly since the evidence suggests this one was aninside job.   Moreover, Orion has insiders with unusual stature. Thecompany's 81-year-old patriarch and founder, Mr. Krim, is oneof the grandest old lions of the business. A short,unprepossessing and by all accounts intensely bright New Yorkattorney, Mr. Krim has a commitment to film making, as wellas powerful connections in national politics, that have madehim a vivid player in a technicolor field. Finance Chairmanof the Democratic Party for John F. Kennedy, a confidant ofLyndon Johnson and friend to former presidential candidateWalter Mondale, Mr. Krim has a reputation, Mr. Mondale says,&quot;for real quality -- unlike so many people in politics andbusiness who are just hacks. He's very wise about a hugerange of areas from arms control to Africa. He's really alegend.&quot;   Orion's majority stockholder, John Kluge, 77, is equallylegendary. Described by Forbes magazine as the richest man inAmerica, with a self-made fortune estimated at $5.9 billion,the founder of privately held Metromedia Co. is besieged bysome 500 requests for financial help a week. Ordinarily, hefocuses his largess on a few favorite charities and restrictshis investments to cold, strategic calculations. But he brokea cardinal rule against mixing business and friendship in1986, when he bought into Orion at the request of hislongtime friend, Mr. Krim.   At first Mr. Kluge's stake was relatively small. But in1988, when Orion was faced with a hostile takeover threat,Mr. Krim again asked Mr. Kluge for help. Mr. Kluge, thoughnot particularly a movie buff nor especially anxious to be inthe business, became the company's largest shareholder,buying more than 15.3 million shares, a 70% stake.   Today, his $240 million stake is worth less than $69million. A Metromedia executive says that for one so rich,the loss amounts to a &quot;flea bite on an elephant,&quot; but headds: &quot;To say that we don't have regrets would be foolish.&quot;   Both Mr. Krim and Mr. Kluge are studiously discreet, andboth repeatedly declined requests for interviews. But anumber of their subordinates suggest that Orion's decline hasdiminished not only the motion picture industry, but also thereputations and the friendship of these two titans. In thecourse of the company's fall, they have both been sued bystockholders claiming that as directors they misledinvestors, a charge the company's lawyer denies. And perhapsmore traumatic, after 30 years of friendship, the two menwere forced into a brutal power play. Last spring, Mr. Kluge,who had been invited in to save the company, pushed Mr. Krimout.   &quot;It wasn't easy,&quot; says Stuart Subotnick, executive vicepresident of Metromedia and a member of Orion's board,breaking Metromedia's silence on Orion's troubles. &quot;But giventhe company's performance over the past two years, it becamenecessary to have a fresh new look, and to ask Arthur to stepaside.&quot;   Mr. Subotnick says Mr. Krim and Mr. Kluge are stillfriends. He says Mr. Krim and his wife, cancer researcher andAIDS activist Matilde Krim, attended &quot;a little gathering&quot; ofMr. Kluge's only a few weeks ago.   But others directly involved in the company say that afterrealizing the dire straits Orion was in about a year ago, Mr.Kluge became angry with Mr. Krim. He is said to have felt hehad been poorly informed by Mr. Krim of the magnitude of thecompany's problems, although Mr. Subotnick downplays this.   Last April, after failing to find a buyer for his stake inthe company, Mr. Kluge moved away from a hands-off positionand seized direct control of Orion and its board. In a movethat struck a note of panic in Hollywood, the Metromediafinancial people forced the Orion production people to try tosell off several movies, and they forced Mr. Krim, who wassaid to have been &quot;crushed,&quot; to relinquish all daily controlof the company, retaining a minority spot on the board andthe largely honorary title of founder/chairman.   What happened to Mr. Krim, say people who know him,borders on the tragic. A proud, stubborn man who was a heroin the business may have stayed in it too long -- sodesperate to keep making movies that he bent the rules toofar.   By all accounts, Mr. Krim is not an easy man to oppose.Although he liked to think that his studio was run like apartnership, many who worked there say it was actually acommittee of one, from the tiniest accounting issue to themost important artistic matters. Exactly how driven Mr. Krimwas to keep looking successful, and whether he violatedgenerally accepted accounting principles to disguise thecompany's mounting losses, probably will be decided in thecourts. But according to a stockholders' class action suitfiled in U.S. district court in New York, as well as accountspieced together from former and current Orion employees, Mr.Krim's drive bordered on disastrous.   From the beginning, contends a former chief financialofficer, Melvin F. Woods, Orion was undercapitalized. In anindustry where the average cost of films is some $25 million,and the cost of marketing can be even more, Orion'smanagement hoped to make films for $15 million to $17 millionand skimp on marketing.   Sometimes it worked. But in many cases Orion appears tohave been unable to keep up with the soaring sums doled outby competitors. Although Orion's President and ChiefExecutive Officer Bill Bernstein says the company has neverlost a project because of inadequate financing, othersdirectly involved say Orion was unable to match Disney's bidfor the Paul Newman films &quot;The Color of Money&quot; and &quot;Blaze.&quot;Two years ago Orion also lost its production head, Morris&quot;Mike&quot; Medavoy, to TriStar.   Despite Orion's attempts to keep costs down, says Mr.Woods, from the start &quot;they spent more money than they tookin, always thinking that they'd have a hit that would savethem.&quot; In the beginning, the company's stock performedextraordinarily well, given Orion's thin capitalization of$55 million in bank credit and the modest assets it hadacquired for $26 million from Filmways Inc. In part, Orionwas boosted by the cachet of its management team -- Messrs.Krim, Bernstein, Medavoy and former president Eric Pleskow --who had worked well together for years.   In the fall of 1982, Sylvestor Stallone's &quot;First Blood&quot;was a hit for Orion after every other major studio had passedon it. Industry critics took notice. &quot;They said `oh, so theseguys are geniuses,' and the stock shot up,&quot; says Mr. Woods.   Orion's luck at the box office didn't hold. But somehowits earnings kept rising, and the stock, pushed by industryanalysts, kept performing. For its first fiscal year, endedin February 1983, the company reported a profit of more than$11 million before taxes. By March, Orion was able to issue2.1 million new shares at $19.50 each, and by May, the shareswere trading at $29.   Yet the Los Angeles Times reported that much of Orion'ssuccess resulted less from solid results than from a legalbut highly unusual &quot;bookkeeping exercise that has created theimpression of dramatic turnaround.&quot; By use of whataccountants call a &quot;quasi,&quot; the management had revaluedassets acquired from Filmways, going from a negative networth of $45 million to a positive net worth of $21.5 millionwith the stroke of a pen.   &quot;It's easy to say they cooked the books, and you may beable to make a case for that,&quot; says Mr. Woods. &quot;But at theend of the day accounting doesn't change how much money youbring in. The bottom line is that their movies didn'tperform,&quot; yet Mr. Krim was determined to show increasedquarterly earnings. &quot;That's what was driving him,&quot; Mr. Woodsasserts. &quot;It was a matter of prestige. It wasn't really aboutmoney -- Orion's executives made more than most people, butbupkes {beans} compared to others in the movie business. Itwas about ego.&quot;   Between 1983 and 1990, the company had some good years,but more bad, as many hoped-for hits proved flops. Yetindustry analysts say a pattern began to emerge in thecompany's financial disclosures. While Orion recorded profitsevery year but 1986, it was also showing rising assets -- agrowing proportion of which were actually failed films thathadn't been written down. The accounting directions camestraight from the top, say several Orion employees.   Orion soon gained a reputation for aggressive accountingin an industry where the rules are notoriously vague. Insteadof writing off failed films, it was carrying many of them onits books as assets. &quot;Orion's multiples were all off,&quot; saysHollywood agent Jonathan Sheinberg, 33, who as senior vicepresident in charge of production helped launch some of thestudio's most successful films before leaving in late 1988.Although he relished the creative atmosphere of the studio,he worried that &quot;they were accounting for assets they didn'thave. And they basically wound up with a big balloon.&quot;   The number of disappointing films that appeared as assetsgrew alarmingly. Between 1985 and 1990, the value Orionplaced on its film inventory grew at an annual pace of $89million. For the year ended February 1991, the companycarried an unamortized film inventory of $766 million, wellin excess of the entire year's revenue of $584 million.   Orion's valuation of its television series &quot;Cagney andLacey,&quot; part of a disastrous attempt at diversifying into TVproduction, was a case in point. According to Jerry Jameson,who formerly ran the western division of Orion's TVsyndication business, the company vastly overvalued the 125episodes it owned of the hit show. In part, the error stemmedfrom a radical change in the TV syndication market, whichsimply fell apart for one-hour dramas in the late 1980s.Instead of receiving the approximately $100 million thecompany had banked on, the show brought in only about $25million. But by then, Orion had not just inflated the show'svalue on its books -- it had also borrowed against it,according to Mr. Jameson.   In April 1987, the Securities and Exchange Commissionbecame curious enough about Orion's accounting to investigateits policy on write-downs. It found nothing illegal.   But in February and March of 1990, Orion became sodesperate for cash to meet its debts and boost its saggingearnings that it executed the deal that many industry expertssay broke the company's back, and raises the most seriousaccounting questions.   An overseas distribution deal was sealed by Mr. Krim withColumbia Pictures, a division of Sony Corp. According to whatthe companies made public, Columbia paid Orion $175 million;this was mostly as an advance against future revenue to beearned from distributing abroad some of the films Orion madeover the next six years, in addition to 50 futurevideocassettes and an unspecified quantity of Orion'spre-1982 film and TV shows. Though it raised immediate cash,the deal mortgaged part of Orion's future profits.   Logically, most of this revenue should have been treatedas deferred earnings, since it reflected the sale of futureproduct. But Orion recorded more than $50 million in cashimmediately, which it said was for the foreign distributionof its pre-1982 movies and TV shows. That lump sum wascrucial in allowing Orion to show a 1990 profit of $20million before taxes rather than a $30 million loss.   According to Paul Brown, a professor of accounting at NewYork University who has examined Orion's financialstatements, inclusion of $50 million in cash for the librarytitles in that year's earnings is questionable. In theprevious year, Orion's foreign revenue from the sameproperties was only $5 million. &quot;If they weren't worthanything like $50 million, that's materially misleading,&quot;says Mr. Brown. &quot;They would have been taking prematurerevenue, and that's a violation of generally acceptedaccounting principles.&quot;   Without more information, Mr. Brown says it's impossibleto determine whether Orion inflated the value of its librarytitles to pump up short-term earnings. But he notes that theyear-earlier valuation is &quot;a darn good indication.&quot; Mr.Bernstein, the Orion CEO, won't comment on the company'saccounting other than to say it is in complete compliancewith the law, and a subject of litigation. Columbiaexecutives involved in the deal also generally decline tocomment, although one says that &quot;we paid $175 million and gotwhat we wanted -- it wasn't up to us to tell Orion how toaccount for it.&quot;   While Columbia's misgivings about Orion's financialstability multiplied during the companies' negotiations,Orion's self-portrait in its 1990 annual report was rosierthan ever. Mr. Krim wrote in his letter to shareholders thatthe year's profits and revenues &quot;established a new high pointfor the company in both categories&quot; and added, &quot;In sum, wefeel optimistic about continuing growth.&quot; In June 1990, Orionbolstered this impression at its stockholders' meeting, whereMr. Krim referred to the company's &quot;good health&quot; in anotherletter to shareholders.   Seven months later, in its Jan. 14 third-quarter financialfiling, the first tremors of the coming earthquake weredetectable. The company showed a net loss for the quarter of$15 million and a negative cash flow of $173.4 million forthe previous nine months; its unamortized film inventory hadballooned to $807.5 million.   But it wasn't until last May, when the company announcedfourth-quarter losses of $48 million, including a $32.8million write-down for its films, that the bubble burst.Prices of Orion bonds fell as much as $15, and Orion's stockplunged into the $4 range. Even as its current films wereleading at the box office and sweeping up Academy Awards, thecompany announced its restructuring plan with bondholders andsaid that without it, Orion would probably have to seekprotection from creditors in a bankruptcy filing.   If the plan goes through, all $267 million of thesubordinated debt will be eliminated, with bondholdersinstead receiving 70% of the common shares of the revampedcompany; Mr. Kluge and Metromedia receiving 29% of the newshares in exchange for $50 million in additional cash; andthe current stockholders getting the remaining 1% of therevamped company.   Orion's problems were inevitable, says entertainmentindustry analyst Lisbeth Barron, a vice president of S.G.Warburg andamp; Co., who contends that the company's aggressiveaccounting methods simply disguised its weaknesses. &quot;I can'ttell you what the intent was. But the result may have been tomislead investors,&quot; she says.   Metromedia hopes the restructuring will go through,allowing it to sell out as soon as possible. &quot;We don't wantto be in this business,&quot; says Mr. Subotnick. &quot;It's crazy. Icould go to Las Vegas and do better.&quot;   But no matter what happens, neither Orion nor thelegendary chief who built it will ever be viewed quite thesame way. &quot;Good movies will still get made,&quot; says ScottRudin, producer of the only new film to be released by Orionthis year, &quot;Little Man Tate.&quot; &quot;But Orion as it was is a thingof the past. It can't be the same -- the people who made itwhat it was are all gone now.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
