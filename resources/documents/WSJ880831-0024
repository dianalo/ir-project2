The telephone equipment company also said it set aside a $1.5 million reserve for the third quarter to pay for severance costs related to the dismissals. The 1987 third-quarter net loss was $595,000 on sales of $67.8 million.    A spokeswoman for the company said the cuts were the largest since the closing of a Lakewood, N.J., plant last December. The business has been buffeted by cost-cutting and competitive pressures since the Bell System breakup four years ago, and has posted losses for the past three years.    TIE has said it expects to reduce annual research and development spending $5 million, to $15 million. In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, TIE closed unchanged at $2.125. </TEXT></DOC>
