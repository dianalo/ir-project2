Specifically, the Board is amending its regulationsto allow insured institutions to engage in over-the-counter (``OTC'') financialoption transactions with certain types of counterparties in addition toprimary dealers in government securities. The Board believes that thereare a variety of entities, other than primary dealers, that trade OTC optionsand are subject to capital adequacy standards and oversight that are sufficientlycomparable to the standards applicable to primary dealers that such otherentities should also be permissible counterparties in OTC option transactions.The amendments are intended to allow insured institutions to use more effectivelythe authority previously granted to them to engage in OTC option transactions.The Board also is revising the manner in which insured institutions accountfor ``short call'' option positions for purposes of Risk Analysis Report(``RAR'') to the Board. Under the existing regulations, an institutionthat enters into a short call option matched against a specific asset,liability, or intended cash-market transaction, may defer any realizedlosses on the option position over the estimated life of the matched itemand recognize the option commitment fee as income over the term of theoption. The Board believes that the present accounting rules may encourageinsured institutions to enter into short call positions solely to takeadvantage of the favorable regulatory accounting treatment, rather thanfor sound economic reasons such as the reduction of interest rate risk.To eliminate that incentive, the Board is amending its regulation to requirethat the income recognition of the commitment fee received by an institutionwriting a call option be deferred until the option position is terminated.At that time, any gains or losses resulting from the option position shallbe recognized, together with the fee income that had previously been deferred.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>August 22, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Robert J.

Board Res. No. 82-557, 47 FR36621 (Aug. 23, 1982). Those regulations permitted an institution to engagein financial option transactions by using any financial option contractdesignated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') or approvedby the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') and based upon a financialinstrument in which the insured institution may invest, or based upon afinancial futures contract. Additionally, such transactions were requiredto be conducted under the terms and conditions established by an exchangedesignated or regulated by the CFTC or the SEC. <T3>See</T3> 12 CFR 563.17-5 (1983). Thus, under the terms of that regulation,insured institutions were not permitted to engage in OTC financial optiontransactions because such transactions do not involve standardized contractsand are not considered to be part of an exchange. <T3>See</T3> Office of Examination and Supervision, Memorandum No. T74,Prohibition Against Over-the-Counter Options Trading (Feb. 14, 1985).As a separate part of that regulation, the Board also established certainaccounting rules to be used for purposes of regulatory reporting by insuredinstitutions engaging in financial option transactions. The Board reasonedthat the establishment of such rules was necessary because at that timethere was no single accounting treatment for financial option transactionsrecognized by the accounting standard setting bodies. The rules adoptedby the Board required insured institutions to use hedge accounting in recognizinggains or losses on long and short call options and long put options thatwere properly matched against cash or forward market positions. Unmatchedlong and short call positions, unmatched long put positions, and any shortput positions were required to be accounted for on a mark-to-market basis.When using hedge accounting, an institution would treat the gain or lossfrom an option position as an adjustment to the carrying amount of thecash or forward market position against which the option was matched. Inorder to use hedge accounting, the Board's rules required that an institutionmatch its option positions against cash or forward market positions andthat the option transactions reduce the interest-rate risks of the correspondingtransactions. The rules further required that an institution divide theoption premium paid or received into two parts: An option commitment feeand the immediate exercise value of the option. The commitment fee wasto be recognized as an expense or revenue item over the term of the optionand the change in immediate exercise value (or ``intrinsic value'') wasto be treated as gain or loss subject to hedge accounting treatment. On April 18, 1985, the Board amended 12 CFR 563.17-5 with regard to permissibletypes of financial option transactions and the regulatory accounting rulesapplicable to short call option positions and also requested public commenton the amendments, which were adopted in final form. Board Res. No. 85-293,50 FR 16459 (April 26, 1985). As part of those amendments, the Board permittedinsured institutions to engage in all types of OTC option transactions(<T3>i.e., </T3>long calls, long puts, short calls, and short puts), butgenerally limited the permissible counterparties in an OTC option transactionto entities that were ``primary dealers'' in government securities (<T3>i.e., </T3>members of the Association of Primary Dealers in UnitedStates Government Securities). The Board adopted the limitation on permissiblecounterparties as a means of minimizing the potential credit and liquidityrisks to which an insured institution trading in OTC financial optionscould be exposed. <T3>See id. </T3>Because primary dealers are actively engaged in the distributionof government securities, are substantially capitalized, make continuousmarkets in government securities, have a long-term commitment to the market,are capable of maintaining a market in OTC option contracts, and are monitoredby the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Board reasoned that permittingprimary dealers to act as counterparties in OTC financial option transactionswould not involve any substantial credit risk_arising by virtue of thenature of the counterparty involved_to insured institutions. Moreover,such a limitation made it unnecessary for the Board to monitor the capitaladequacy of all potential counterparties with which an institution couldtrade OTC options. The Board also allowed insured institutions to conductOTC option trading with affiliates of a primary dealer, provided, however,that the affiliate was substantially engaged in dealing in government securitiesand its performance under an OTC option contract was guaranteed by theprimary dealer. In those amendments, the Board also revised its regulatory accounting rulesfor short call option transactions in order to eliminate the potentialfor certain abusive practices that had arisen under the initial accountingrules adopted in 1982. Under the prior rules, an institution receivinga fee for writing a call option would recognize the option commitment feeas income over the term of the option. If the option was matched againsta specific asset, liability, or intended cash market position, any realizedgains or losses on the option position would be deferred over the estimatedlife of the matched item. The Board expressed its belief at that time thatsuch accounting treatment could lead an institution to enter into shortcalls to record the option commitment fee as current income. In order todeter insured institutions from entering into short call opotion positionssolely for the benefit derived from a favorable accounting rule, the Boardamended 12 CFR 563.17-5(g) to require that option commitment fees receivedfor the sale of matched call options be recorded as a discount on the matcheditem. That fee, as well as any related losses from the option transactions,would be deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the matcheditem.On May 24, 1985, the Board rescinded the accounting portion of the amendmentsthat had been adopted on April 18, 1985, and reinstated the initial accountingrules in order to give further consideration to the most appropriate methodof accounting for short call options. Board Res. No. 85-420, 50 FR 23395(June 4, 1985). On the same date, the Board separately issued an advancenotice of proposed rulemaking, which requested public comment on all ofthe related accounting aspects of short call option transactions in whichinsured institutions may engage. Board Res. No. 85-421, 50 FR 23432 (June4, 1985). After considering the comments received in response to the advance noticeand the solicitation of comments made in conjunction with the April 18,1985 amendments, the Board proposed amendments to 12 CFR 563.17-5 withregard to the permissible counterparties for OTC option transactions andthe accounting rules for short call options. Board Res. No. 85-1196, 50FR 53336 (December 31, 1985) (the ``Proposal''). The comment period onthe Proposal closed on March 3, 1986. The Board received eighteen commentletters in response to the Proposal. The largest group (6) were submittedby insured institutions. Of the remainder, 5 were submitted by trade associations,3 were submitted by broker-dealer firms, 2 were submitted by law firms,1 was submitted by an accounting firm, and 1 was submitted by a futuresexchange. After carefully considering the issues raised by the commenters,the Board today is adopting the Proposal as a final rule, with certainmodifications as described below. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Permissible Counterparties </ITAG>A. The Proposal Based on its concerns that the present regulations may be unnecessarilyrestrictive, may have the unintended effect of denying smaller insuredinstitutions access to the OTC option market, and may be anti-competitiveby prohibiting well capitalized entities other than primary dealers fromdealing with insured institutions, the Board proposed to amend 12 CFR 563.17-5by allowing insured institutions to engage in OTC option transactions withthe following additional types of entities:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Banks that are subject to regulation and supervision by the Comptrollerof the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the Boardof Governors of the Federal Reserve System and are in compliance with theirapplicable regulatory capital requirement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Institutions that are subject to regulation and supervision by theFSLIC and are in compliance with their regulatory capital requirement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Brokers registered with the SEC and subject to regulation and supervisionby the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') and that arein compliance with their capital requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Futures commission merchants registered with the CFTC and that arein compliance with their capital requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home LoanMortgage Corporation, or the Government National Mortgage Association.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Other entities, upon application, that the FSLIC determines are adequatelyregulated by a government entity or a self-regulatory agency, are subjectto capital adequacy standards, and are regularly audited and examined.</ITAG>The Board requested public comment on whether the types of institutionsdescribed in the above categories would be appropriate counterparties forinsured institutions and whether there exist any additional entities whosecapital adequacy, stability, and regulatory supervision are such that theyalso should be included in the category of entities permitted to act ascounterparties in OTC option transactions. More specifically, the Boardrequested public comment on whether insured institutions should be permittedto engage in OTC option transactions with certain unregulated entities,such as unregulated government securities dealers, or Federal Home LoanBanks (``District Banks''). The Board also requested comment on whetherit should require the depository institutions that act as counterpartiesbe in compliance with their regulatory capital requirements as a conditionto acting as a counterparty to an insured institution. B. Summary of Comments All the commenters that commented on the permissible counterparties aspectof the Proposal supported the proposed expansion of the type of counterpartieswith which insured institutions may enter into OTC option transactions.One additional commenter, a national broker-dealer firm, supported expandingthe list of permissible counterparties to include the Federal Home LoanBanks. In recognition of the potential benefits to insured institutions,the Board has determined that it is appropriate to include the DistrictBanks as a category of permissible counterparties. Several of the commenters stated their belief that any depository institutionthat is permitted to act as a counterparty in an OTC option transactionmust be in compliance with its regulatory capital requirements in orderto help satisfy the Board's liquidity and credit risk concerns. One commenterexpressed the view that such a condition would be inequitable due to thevariation in regulatory capital requirements between FDIC and FSLIC insuredinstitutions. The Board notes, however, that any potential inequity willin time be largely obviated by its recently revised regulatory capitalrequirements. <T3>See </T3>Board Res. No. 86-857, 51 FR 33565 (September 22, 1986) andBoard Res. No. 87-661, 52 FR 23845 (June 25, 1987). In the meantime, theBoard believes it is desirable that each type of counterparty be in compliancewith the capital requirement deemed appropriate for it by its regulator.Several commenters felt strongly that unregulated securities dealers shouldnot under any circumstances be permissible counterparties. In this regard,the Board notes that the Government Securities Act of 1986 (the ``1986Act''), amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act''),effective July 25, 1987, to require previously unregulated government securitiesbrokers and dealers to register with the SEC. Further, the 1986 Act authorizesthe Secretary of the Treasury to propose and adopt rules with respect tofinancial responsibility and related practices of government securitiesbrokers and dealers. <T3>See </T3>Exchange Act Section 15C. The Treasury has exercised suchauthority by adopting various financial responsibility and related rules,which are patterned after similar SEC rules. <T3>See </T3>52 FR 27910 (July 24, 1987). Two commenters, a trade association and a savings and loan association,felt that the proposed requirements that each counterparty notify the DistrictDirector-Examinations of the Federal Home Loan Bank in the district inwhich the insured institution is located immediately following the enteringinto an OTC option transaction and that such counterparty report monthlyon the outstanding position of the insured institution were impracticable.These commenters suggested that it would be more appropriate for the insuredinstitutions to bear the responsibility for reporting information regardingOTC option transactions. The Board agrees with these commenters that it would be appropriate forthe bulk of the reporting obligation to be borne by the insured institutions.However, the Board notes that several of the District Banks have emphasizedthe usefulness of the counterparty reports they have been receiving pursuantto the no-action position taken by the Board in Res. No. 85-1196. Accordingly,the amendments retain the requirement for immediate notification but deletethe monthly reporting requirement by the relevant counterparty. One commenter, a futures exchange, expressed concern that the Proposalmight be misunderstood by some insured institutions as authorizing OTCtransactions in commodity options, subject to the jurisdiction of the CFTCpursuant to sections 2(a), 2(b) and 4(c) of the Commodity Exchange Act(``CEA''). This commenter pointed out that, except for certain limitedexceptions that are generally inapplicable to transactions by insured institutions,the CEA and the regulations thereunder generally prohibit OTC transactionsin commodity options by U.S. entities.\1\<NOTE/> The Board did not and does not intend to authorize insuredinstitutions to enter into OTC commodity option transactions subject tothe jurisdiction of the CFTC that are not otherwise authorized under theCEA and the regulations thereunder. The final rule clarifies this pointby excluding OTC commodity option transactions from the definition of financialoption contract contained in 12 CFR 563.17-5(a)(4). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>See </T3>17 CFR Parts 32 and 33.Two commenters, a national trade association and a law firm writing onbehalf of a federal savings and loan association, were concerned that theProposal could be read to have application to optional delivery forwardcommitment contracts (so-called ``standby commitments'') to purchase andsell mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. These commenters noted thatthe use of standby commitments was an integral component of the mortgageloan origination process for many insured institutions, especially smallerinstitutions. These commenters further noted that standby commitment fundingwas typically provided through special purpose subsidiaries of bank holdingcompanies, a category of entities not included as possible permissiblecounterparties in the Proposal. These commenters urged the Board to clarifythe Proposal to exclude standby commitments from the definition of ``financialoption contracts'' in order to avoid denying smaller institutions accessto the secondary mortgage market. The Board wishes to make clear that the Proposal was not intended to coverstandby commitments to purchase and sell mortgages and mortgage-backedsecurities when used by insured institutions as part of the mortgage loanorigination process. Toward this end, the amendments to 12 CFR 563.17-5specifically exclude standby commitments used as part of an insured institution'smortgage loan origination process from the definition of financial optiontransactions. However, the Board is aware that certain insured institutions have issuedstandby commitments as a means to speculate on interest rates. Such speculativeuse of standby commitments appears indistinguishable from uncovered (or``naked'') short put positions in financial option contracts from botheconomic and policy viewpoints. Accordingly, although the Board is leavingundisturbed the current preferential treatment of standby commitments usedas part of an insured institution's mortgage loan origination process,it wishes to note its concerns in this area and to caution insured institutionsagainst the speculative use of standby commitments.\2\<NOTE/> The Board will monitor the activities of insured institutionswith respect to the use of standby commitments and will propose additionalamendments to its regulations in the future if warranted. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\The Board further notes that 12 CFR 563.17-3(c)(1) prohibitsinsured institutions from entering into standby commitments at a priceother than ``actual market value.'' Accordingly, regardless of labels,any financial instrument concerning the purchase and sale of securitiesat a price other than ``actual market value'' would not be a standby commitmentunder the Board's regulation. C. Amendments to 12 CFR 563.17-5 Having considered the comment letters summarized above, the Board is adoptingamendments to 12 CFR 563.17-5 regarding permissible counterparties in OTCoption transactions. The final rule, as adopted by the Board, incorporatesseveral modifications of the Proposal. One modification expands the list of permissible counterparties to include,not only the specific types of entities listed in the Proposal, but alsothe Federal Home Loan Banks, and government securities brokers and dealersregistered with the SEC pursuant to section 15(b) or 15C of the ExchangeAct, that are subject to regulation by the Treasury Department, that aremembers of either a Registered Securities Association or a National SecuritiesExchange (registered in accordance with sections 6 and 19(a) of the ExchangeAct), and that are in compliance with their applicable capital requirements.The category ``brokers registered with the SEC and subject to regulationand supervision by the NASD ***'' has been slightly modified to be moretechnically precise. As adopted, this category reads: ``Brokers or dealersregistered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and subject to regulationand supervision by a Registered Securities Association (registered pursuantto section 15A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''))or a National Securities Exchange (registered pursuant to sections 6 and19(a) of the Exchange Act) and that is in compliance with its applicablecapital requirements.''In recognition of the credit and liquidity risk associated with long positionsin OTC financial option contracts (<T3>e.g., </T3>in contrast to standardized option contracts, there areno performance guarantees to protect an insured institution from the riskof default by the short side of the OTC option contract), the amendmentslimit the dollar amount of long OTC option positions that an insured institutioncan maintain with any single counterparty to the same extent as the limitationsplaced on aggregate loans to one borrower, now or hereafter in effect,pursuant to 12 CFR 563.9-3(b)(1). As currently in effect, that limitationprohibits an insured institution from making loans to any one borrowerin an amount in excess of ten percent of such institution's withdrawableaccounts or one hundred percent of its regulatory capital, whichever amountis less. The Board believes such a limitation is necessary with regardto OTC option transactions to protect the FSLIC fund from undue risk. However, the Board recognizes that specific counterparties will have varyingdegrees of creditworthiness and that flexibility in this regard is desirable.Accordingly, the amendments authorize approval by an insured institution'sPrincipal Supervisory Agent (``PSA'') of proposed OTC option transactionswith a specific counterparty in excess of the limitations imposed by 12CFR 563.9-3(b)(1) whenever the PSA determines that such transactions donot subject the FSLIC to undue risk. In this regard, the amendments directthe PSA to consider the creditworthiness of the specific counterparty,the insured institution's experience with that counterparty and with transactingin financial option and futures contracts generally, the nature of thesubject contracts (<T3>e.g., </T3>matched or unmatched), and any other circumstances deemedrelevant by the PSA. In order to limit processing delays, the amendmentsprovide that an application will be deemed approved if it is not deniedby the PSA within 10 calendar days from the date the application was filed.The Board believes that the prior approval mechanism for transactions thatexceed the applicable limitations will provide insured institutions withnecessary flexibility in implementing their investment and risk managementstrategies while, at the same time, protecting the FSLIC fund from unduerisk. In addition, the Board notes that the subject limitations are substantiallyless stringent than the tentative thresholds for required disclosures regardingmaximum credit risk concentrated in an individual counterparty (over 20percent of equity and 1 percent of total assets, or over 10 percent oftotal assets) as announced by the Financial Accounting Standards Board(``FASB''). <T3>See </T3>Financial Accounting Standards Board, Exposure Draft, ProposedStatement of Financial Accounting Standards: Disclosure about FinancialInstruments (November 30, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Accounting for Short Call Option Positions</ITAG>A. The ProposalBased on its desire to discourage insured institutions from entering intoshort call option positions solely to take advantage of a favorable regulatoryaccounting treatment, the Board proposed to amend 12 CFR 563.17-5 to requireinsured institutions to use a simplified mark-to-market approach to accountfor short call financial option transactions. Under that approach, theoption commitment fee received for writing a matched call option wouldbe deferred until the option expires, the institution is called to performunder the option contract, or the institution offsets its short position.At the time that an institution terminates its short call position throughone of the above methods, it would be required to aggregate the commitmentfee received with any resulting gain or loss on the option position andrecord the net result as income or expense. The Board noted in the Proposal its belief that by requiring insured institutionsto recognize the net gain or loss at the time the option position is terminated,the resulting accounting would more accurately reflect the true economicsubstance of a short call option transaction than the existing accountingtreatment. In addition, the Board notes that such an approach furthersthe requirement in the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 (``CEBA''),Pub. L. 100-86 101, Stat. 552, that the Board and the FSLIC issue regulationsprescribing ``uniformly applicable accounting standards to be used by allinsured institutions for the purpose of measuring compliance with any ruleor regulation'' promulgated by the Board or the FSLIC ``to the same degreethat generally accepted accounting principles are used to determine compliancewith rules and regulations of the Federal banking agencies.'' \3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See</T3> section 402(b) of the CEBA.B. Summary of CommentsEleven of the commenters commented on the accounting for short call optionsaspect of the Proposal. Two of the commenters supported the proposed changein the accounting for short call options. Two other commenters recommendedthat the Board not change existing accounting rules until such time asthe FASB establishes generally accepted accounting principles (``GAAP'')for financial option transactions.The Board does not anticipate a FASB pronouncement in this area in thenear future. For this reason, and in light of several recent instanceswhere misuse of short call optionshas resulted in or contributed to financialdifficulties for insured institutions,\4\<NOTE/> the Board believes that leaving the existing regulatory accountingrules unchanged is not a viable alternative. At such time as GAAP for financialoption transactions is clarified, the Board will reexamine its rules inthis area.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ For example, in one instance, an institution's coveredcall writing investment strategy degenerated into a large speculative optionselling program. The institution sold increasing amounts of call and putoptions to offset losses on previously established option positions. Theinstitution had large unrealized losses resulting from the exercise ofshort put options against it, which losses were subsequently offset bygains on sales of securities when, fortuitously, interest rates fell. Theinstitution's speculative strategy could easily have resulted in its financialruin under a different interest rate scenario. Such a strategy constitutesan unsafe and unsound practice. <ITAG tagnum="28">In another instance, as part of an interest rate guarantee program,an institution (through an investment adviser) bought put options as protectionagainst rising interest rates. To offset the cost of the put purchases,the institution sold naked short call options. When interest rates fellthe institution incurred substantial losses, which led to its liquidation.</ITAG>Several commenters recommended that short call options be accounted foron a mark-to-market basis. Because insured institutions file regulatoryreports with the Board on a monthly basis, such a requirement would necessitatemarking positions to the market at least monthly. The Board has determinednot to adopt such an approach at this time because it exceeds the scopeof the Proposal. Instead, as described below, the amendments provided fora simplified approach effectively requiring option positions to be marked-to-marketwhen such position is terminated.One commenter, a futures exchange, observed that the proposed accountingfails to reflect the economic substance of options transactions. The concernsraised could be resolved only by requiring mark-to-market accounting forboth the written option position as well as the matched cash market oranticipated transactions. Such an approach, although potentially justifiableon economic grounds, would mark a substantial departure from an historicalcost accounting treatment under GAAP. The Board has, therefore, determinednot to implement this alternative at this time. Two commenters recommended that ``hedge'' accounting treatment should beafforded a short call option position when the options strike price issubstantially below the market price for the underlying security (so-called``deep-in-the-money'' option). Those commenters made reference to certainconclusions by the Accounting Standards Executive Committee issued on August15, 1986, in response to a March 6, 1986 Issues Paper by the American Instituteof Certified Public Accountants entitled ``Accounting for Options,'' whichwould permit hedge accounting treatment for deep-in-the-money options.The Board recognizes that a short call option that is matched to a longposition in a specific security (so-called ``covered call'') does providesome protection against price changes in the matched security. Further,it is recognized that hedge accounting treatment for deep-in-the-moneycovered call positions does have some theoretical merit because, for limitedintervals of price decreases in the underlying security, deep-in-the-moneycovered call options protect against a loss in value of the ``covered''security. However, because of the calculation complexities in correctlyaccounting for such positions and because deep-in-the-money call optionsare rarely sold by insured institutions, the Board has determined thathedge accounting for any short call option position would be inappropriate.Two commenters pointed out that call writing can be used effectively tohedge a long security position when the call position is periodically adjustedto ``preserve delta neutrality.'' The Board notes that preservation ofdelta neutrality requires that position adjustments be made on an ongoingand frequent basis to insure that changes in the value of the securitybeing hedged are exactly offset by changes in the value of the option position.Consequently, a great deal of position monitoring and adjustment to ``hedgeratios'' is necessary to maintain delta neutrality. Because of an almostconstant need to monitor and adjust positions and, as previously noted,the complexities involved in hedge accounting, the Board does not believeapplying hedge accounting to ``delta neutral'' positions (<T3>i.e., </T3>a position that utilizes the ratio of the change in optionprice to the change in price of the hedged assets to determine the precisenumber of option contracts required at any point in time in order to offsetexactly the change in price of the hedged asset) is a practical alternative.C. Amendments to 12 CFR 563.17-5Having considered the comment letters summarized above, the Board is adoptingamendments to 12 CFR 563.17-5 regarding the accounting treatment for shortcall financial option positions. The amendments follow the simplified mark-to-marketapproach substantially as proposed in the Proposal. The Board believesthat the amendments will more accurately reflect the true economic substanceof a short call option transaction and will discourage insured institutionsfrom entering into such positions solely to take advantage of the priormore favorable accounting treatment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>Pursuant to section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 604,the Board is providing the following regulatory flexibility analysis. 1.
