L. 99-251, enacted on February27, 1986, and entitled the ``Federal Employees Benefits Improvement Actof 1986,'' amended the FEHB law by requiring restoration of payment toall qualified providers in Medically Underserved Areas effective January1, 1985. Each year, OPM compares the latest Department of Health and HumanServices state-by-state population counts on primary medical care manpowershortage areas with U.S. Census figures on state resident population anddetermines which states qualify as Medically Underserved Areas for thenext calendar year.OPM has determined that for 1988 the following six states are MedicallyUnderserved Areas for purposes of the FEHB Program: Alabama, Louisiana,Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota, and West Virginia. This differsfrom OPM's determination for 1987 in that the states of North Dakota andSouth Dakota have been added to the group of states designated as medicallyunderserved and the state of Wyoming is no longer included.<ITAG tagnum="84">Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>Under sections 553(b)(3)(B) and (d)(3) of title 5, United States Code,I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposedrulemaking and for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.The notice is being waived because OPM's annual determination of MedicallyUnderserved Areas, which takes effect on January 1 of each year, is a purelymechanical calculation based on statistical data and cannot be changedunder current law.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because they primarily affectFederal employees, annuitants, and former spouses.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 890</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedures, Government employees, Health insurance.<ITAG tagnum="21">U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
