Wang, 24, stood motionless as U.S. District Court Judge KevinDuffy lectured him about his illegal act before imposing thesentence, which also includes three years' probation.   Wang, who would be eligible for parole after a year, could havebeen sentenced to five years and heavy fines for each of three fraudcounts against him.   Shaking his head, Duffy said, ``Stephen Wang, I hope to God younever end up in a court of law again.''   Wang, a former junior analyst at the investment firm Morgan,Stanley andamp; Co., admitted to scheming with Taiwan-born businessmanFred C. Lee to profit on secret tips about impending corporatetakeovers that Morgan Stanley was handling. Lee, who is not in theUnited States, allegedly made $19 million on the informationprovided between July 1987 and April 1988, and paid $200,000 to Wang.   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which sued the pair inlate June, had demanded the return of the illegal profits plustriple damages for a total of $76 million, making it the secondbiggest insider trading case behind that of convicted felon IvanBoesky.   In 1986, Boesky agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settlecharges of trading on insider information. He is serving athree-year prison term after pleading guilty last year to conspiringto file a false statement with the SEC.   Before Wang was sentenced his lawyer, Ira L. Sorkin, told thejudge his client ``fully recognizes the seriousness of the crimes.At no time has he sought to minimize his involvement or theseriousness of what he has done.''   Sorkin said, ``He's broke, he has no job, he's unable to finishhis education, he has no place to live except with relatives. Hedisgraced his family and hurt the firm that trusted him.''   Wang, wearing a gray suit with a dark, dotted tie, told Duffy,``I'm deeply sorry for what I've done. I've incurred a lot of debtsand losses of other people. I'm going to try to make amends for it.''   But Duffy, calling it a particularly troubling case, rebuked Wangbecause he had grown up in an affluent family and had no excuse forwhat he did.   ``Apparently, the first time you could have been a crook, youwere,'' Duffy said.   ``In the eyes of society, a person who knowingly goes out to harmthe world, becomes a person who must be punished,'' the judge said.   Duffy said a fine was inappropriate because Wang had no money.   ``As far as I can figure out, you're worth zero,'' the judgesaid. ``Therefore any punishment at all has to be in the area ofimprisonment.''   Duffy gave Wang one month to get his affairs in order beforesurrendering to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. The exact location ofhis imprisonment has not been determined, but Sorkin told reportersafterward he would try to have Wang placed in a facility near hisfamily, who live in the Chicago area.   Sorkin declined to comment on the appropriateness of thesentence, saying, ``I don't try to second-guess judges.''   Assistant U.S. Attorney John McEnany also declined comment on thesentence. He also would not comment on possible efforts to prosecuteLee, who is believed to be in Hong Kong.</TEXT></DOC>
