The main factors of the evaluationof the photovoltaic power generation as power generating equipment areroughly devided into the following three: the economic factor, the technicalfactor, and the social factor. In this study, the assessmant is performedby centering on the economic factor while taking the thechnical factorinto consideration. Expressions for quantitatively assessing such basicfactors of evaluation as capacity of photvoltaic power generation, supplycapacity of generating equipment, reserve supply power of the currentelectrical source and reliability of the supply of the current electricalsource are presented. Subsequently, physical KW values of photovoltaicpower generation were calculated from the stand point of reliabilityof supply dealing only with the electric utility. The result showed thatthe KW value of the photovoltaic power generation for the peak durationof 10 hours was approximately 30% of that of the standard generationequipment (equivalent to a middle class thermal plant).
