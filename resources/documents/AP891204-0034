The political equation of Taiwan was rearranged over the weekend.   Observers hailed the vote as a step forward for democracy eventhough it was marred by allegations of widespread vote-buying. ``ANationalist Setback, Redistribution of Political Power,'' read onenewspaper headline.   Most stunning, indeed, were the losses suffered by theNationalist Party, which has ruled Taiwan for 40 years afterfleeing a Communist takeover on the Chinese mainland. Nationalistcandidates polled 58 percent of the popular vote, down from 70percent in 1986.   Next in line came the strong showing of a feisty 2-year-oldopposition party, which won important posts in local elections andgained in the national Legislature.   ``This is a glorious victory,'' said opposition leader TsaiShi-yuan.   The Democratic Progressive Party, of which Tsai is deputysecretary general, garnered 33 percent of the vote and independentallies swelled its total to nearly 40 percent. Two years ago, itwon 22 percent.   Much of the party's support came from native Taiwanese, who makeup about 80 percent of the population but were displacedpolitically when the Nationalists seized power in 1949.   A third development was the relatively free debate in thecampaign. One candidate, a former dancer, ran on a platform of freelove. She lost.   Others openly risked charges of sedition when they called onTaiwan to declare itself independent from China and abandon thedream of recovering the mainland. At least 20 of 32 members of apro-independence group won seats in various contests.   Taiwan's rapid economic growth in the 1970s created anincreasingly sophisticated population, which chafed at laws thatcould jail men and women for speaking their minds.   Several years after the 1975 death of autocratic PresidentChiang Kai-shek, the Nationalists began experimenting withpolitical reform. Martial law was lifted in 1987 after 38 years;limited press freedoms were granted; political parties werelegalized.   But many said reforms came too slow. And the vote Saturdayappears to be a rejection of the pace of change in a politicalsystem that still perpetuates Nationalist rule.   Television and radio remain under Nationalist control and werecriticized throughout the campaign for anti-opposition reporting.   Even if the opposition won every vote, it could not havechallenged Nationalist control. The 256-seat Legislature and theelectoral college are dominated by hundreds of elderly Nationalistselected for life on the Chinese mainland in the late 1940s andfrozen in office to support the party's claim to be the legitimateruler of all China.   Despite the problems, the oppositions made huge gains.   In the Legislature, the opposition and its allies won at least21 seats, up from 12 seats. For the first time in Taiwan's history,the opposition can introduce legislation because 20 co-sponsors arerequired for each bill.   The opposition also captured six of the country's 16 countyexecutive posts and other local seats. With these victories, theopposition is presented with the challenge of proving it can run alocal government and solve environmental problems and askyrocketing crime rate.   The opposition also can move to limit the far-reaching controlof the Nationalists over everyday life.   A model cited by many is an independent candidate who waselected as county executive of Ilan in 1986 and is dismantling theNationalist Party machine in his district.   Surveillance files kept on government employees were burned,pictures of Nationalist leaders were taken down, politicalindoctrination is being reduced in the schools and a nuclear powerplant, backed by Nationalists, was stopped.   ``One of the first things I will do is demolish the NationalistParty headquarters,'' said You Ching, in a speech to supportersafter he won the executive seat in Taipei county. ``Then you willbe able to walk your dogs on the property.''   Still, pundits have warned opposition candidates not to push theNationalists too far too fast.   Although possibilities for a conservative backlash appearslight, the Nationalists might be tempted to pass legislationlimiting the power of the local governments and negating oppositiongains.   Such tactics could spark unrest among the people. Allegations ofvote-rigging during the election caused thousands to surroundcounty offices. Early today, about 10,000 protesters who accusedthe Nationalists of vote fraud ended a 30-hour siege of agovernment office in southern Taiwan.   For the Nationalists, the election challenged an aging partythat has grown somewhat fat on the luxury of one-party rule.   ``We calmly accept an upset,'' Party Secretary General JamesSoong said after a hastily held meeting of party leaders Sunday.``We shall continue with reforms and improve what we did not dowell.''   Some in the party have called for faster political reforms.   ``The vote shows the people demand change,'' said C.L. Chiou, apolitical science professor. ``The Nationalists must bend with thewind.''</TEXT></DOC>
