(FDC)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Bank trade associations have launched acampaign to persuade the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. notto boost the premiums banks pay to the deposit insurance fundthis year.   In a letter to FDIC Chairman William Taylor, the leadersof five banking groups said, &quot;We are very concerned that ahigher assessment would hurt the economic recovery thatappears to be under way&quot; by making banks less able to lend.</LP><TEXT>   Banks currently pay a premium of 23 cents on each $100 ofdomestic deposits. Mr. Taylor has hinted that the premiumwill rise at mid-year, possibly to as high as 30 cents, topump money into the Bank Insurance Fund, which has beendrained by more than 1,000 bank failures over the past sixyears.   Last year, Congress authorized the FDIC to borrow as muchas $30 billion from the Treasury to help the fund through thecontinuing wave of bank failures. The law requires the FDICestablish a premium schedule that will repay the loans in 15years and build the fund's reserves to 1.25% of insureddeposits.   Leaders of banking committees in Congress want the FDIC toboost premiums quickly to reduce the chances that the bankdeposit fund will require a taxpayer bailout, similar to thepublic rescue of depositors in savings and loans. Given thecongressional pressure, the FDIC isn't likely to skip apremium increase this summer. The last increase was in June1991, when the premium rose to 23 cents from 19.5 cents.   Separately, a House Banking Committee study raisedquestions about the benefits of banking industry mergers andconsolidations, which Bush administration and many bankerscontend are the key to a stronger banking industry. The staffstudy found that larger banks have a lower return on assetsthat smaller banks. The study, which is likely to form thebasis for committee hearings on the bank mergers, is one ofseveral recent analyses to raise doubts about the advantagesof banking consolidation.</TEXT></DOC>
