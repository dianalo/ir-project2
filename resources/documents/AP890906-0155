Negotiators for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization willlikely offer detailed plans for restricting military activitiesduring the third round of negotiations aimed at reducing non-nucleararms in Europe, said an alliance official, who demanded anonymity.   The talks begin in Vienna on Thursday.   The discussions between the 16 NATO nations and the seven WarsawPact countries began in early March to cut troops, tanks, combataircraft and helicopters, and armored personnel carriers. Thebargaining covers an area spanning the Atlantic Ocean to the UralMountains in the Soviet Union.   The negotiations are designed to produce a treaty setting equalceilings on NATO and Warsaw Pact tanks, artillery, armored troopcarriers, aircraft, helicopters and possibly manpower.   President Bush said in June he wanted to complete the agreementwithin a year, but the two alliances have not agreed on a number ofbasic issues, including measures to verify how an agreement would bekept.   The latest NATO proposals mark ``the first time Western countriesare planning to introduce military constraints,'' said a NATOofficial, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.   ``Major military activities should be cut, like maneuvers,'' hesaid.   The proposals would set a threshold limiting the size of theseexercises to several tens of thousands of soldiers or severalhundreds of battle tanks, he said. One maneuver exceeding the limitcould be held every two years.   Also, officials were working on details of proposals forexchanging information on force structures and verifying compliancewith a treaty.   In Vienna, a Western diplomat demanding anonymity said ``sometough issues'' remain to be resolved on verification.   He specifically mentioned divisions between countries like theUnited States and Canada, which want maximum surveillance, andEuropean nations, which are concerned about constant visits bySoviet-bloc military personnel.   The Europeans, he explained, ``say, `I don't want to live withSoviet inspectors climbing in and out of my bases all the time.'''   Another Western diplomat, who spoke on condition he not befurther identified, said he expected the verification proposals tobe presented during the current six-week session.   The senior NATO official said the Western nations want to set upways to monitor in detail the arms cuts called for in the treaty.   ``Once the reductions are achieved ... we want to haveconfirmation by intrusive measures of compliance,'' he said.   He said the allies want regular on-site inspections of placeswhere equipment targeted in the treaty would be located. ``Eachparticipant is liable to receive on its territory an agreed quota ofsuch inspections,'' he said.   A separate package of proposals, he said, would cover theexchange of information between the East and West on the commandstructure of their ground and air forces.   It also would give the locations of units singled out forreductions, storage depots and armored vehicle launched bridges.   NATO has proposed both sides be limited to no more than 5,700combat aircraft and 1,900 combat helicopters each. No country couldhave more than 3,420 combat aircraft and 1,140 combat helicopters.   Other suggested limits are 20,000 tanks, 16,500 artillery piecesand 28,000 armored troop carriers for each alliance.   It has also proposed allowing the United States and the SovietUnion to station no more than 275,000 troops in Europe, outside oftheir national territories.   This would amount to a 20 percent cut in U.S. combat troops inEurope, reducing overall U.S. troop strength by about 10 percent.There are about 150,000 U.S. combat troops in Europe and more than150,000 support personnel.   The Soviets have an estimated 625,000 troops in Eastern andCentral Europe. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has already offeredto cut to 350,000 and has proposed equal ceilings of NATO and WarsawPact forces of 1.35 million.</TEXT></DOC>
