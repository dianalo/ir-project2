Metzenbaum.    I have observed the Senate in action, from the inside, for 15 years. I can assure your readers that a senator cannot &quot;amass power,&quot; to use your phrase, by being an obstructionist. Any senator who just says no to other senators' bills would seldom, if ever, get any of his own bills passed. And Sen. Metzenbaum has an outstanding record of legislative accomplishment.    The Senate has passed scores of bills and amendments he has introduced: safeguarding infant formula, increasing research funding for drugs that cure rare diseases, expanding the day-care tax credit, promoting energy conservation, protecting retiree's health benefits, and, just the other day, protecting workers against precipitous plant closings and major layoffs.    Sen. Metzenbaum has indeed been &quot;Senator No&quot; -- and a very effective one -- to special tax breaks and pork barrel that could have cost the Treasury billions of dollars. He has repeatedly blown the whistle and won the battle through hard work, guts and willingness to spend long hours on the Senate floor.    He has been, in my opinion, an outstanding senator for Ohio and the nation.    You may not always agree with him on the issues. I don't. But you have to admire the man. I do.    Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D., La.)    Washington</TEXT></DOC>
