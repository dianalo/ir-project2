Soweto, home to about 2.5 million blacks on the outskirts ofJohannesburg, has had a high crime rate for years. But a sense ofcrisis has developed in recent weeks because of a wave of brazencrimes by gangs of young men known as the ``Jack Rollers.''   The gangs, which take their name from the lyrics of a popularsong, cruise Soweto's streets in their cars, robbing other motoristsand abducting women.   A boyfriend of one rape victim was murdered a few days ago, andnewspapers have reported incidents where teen-age girls wereabducted at gunpoint from their classrooms while teachers looked onhelplessly.   Last weekend, the South African Council of Churches, best knownfor its anti-apartheid activism, sponsored a conference at a Sowetocommunity center to discuss ways of combatting crime.   The conference took place during a 48-hour span in which 24murders, 13 rapes and 55 robberies were reported in Soweto.   Participants at the conference resolved to establish youthcenters, convey warnings to gang leaders, and revive neighborhood``street committees'' that proliferated in 1984-86 before policebroke them up.   The government depicted the street committees as vigilante groupsled by radicals, but proponents said the committees helped reducecrime as part of an effort to mobilize anti-apartheid activity on alocal level.   The Rev. Frank Chikane, secretary-general of the church council,said the surge of gang activity ``is clearly a result of thebreakdown of community structures by state repression ... and theinherent inability and apparent reluctance of the state to deal withthe situation.''   Other activists say the problem stems partly from restrictions onblack high school enrollment. They say many youths who were refusedreadmission to school in January after failing examinations haveturned to crime out of frustration.   A police spokesman, Maj. Noel Hartwell, said efforts to arrestthe gangsters have been hampered by lack of public cooperation.   ``We cannot act on theories,'' he said. ``People must comeforward and report these things.''   But Dr. Nthato Motlana, a prominent Soweto civic leader, said atthe weekend conference that the community mistrusts police officersand question their priorities.   ``When called to attend to a rape incident, for instance, theysay there are no vans,'' Motlana said. ``But when people are said tobe terrorists, 10 vans will rush to the scene immediately.''   Police are not the only scapegoats. The National Institute forCrime and Prevention, a private crime prevention organization, saysSoweto's problems stem not only from inadequate police protectionbut also from unemployment, poverty, drug and alcohol abuse, and abreakdown of family life.   The country's largest daily newspaper, The Star of Johannesburg,this week endorsed the call for a revival of street committees,saying this would be ``an immediate practical step'' to combat crime.   But The Star's editorial said crime would persist as long asSowetans remained impoverished and disenfranchised.   ``Ultimately, a lasting solution must be sought in politicalchange,'' it said.</TEXT></DOC>
