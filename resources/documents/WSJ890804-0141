The gas producers will mail ballots to two Calgary-based gas marketing concerns, Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd. and Western Gas Marketing Ltd., voting to accept or reject eleven contracts to supply utilities and independent power producers in the Northeast with as much as 489.5 million cubic feet of gas daily.    About 189.8 million cubic feet of the gas is meant to supply the $354 million Champlain natural gas pipeline, planned to supply natural gas to New England. The balance of the gas is for Connecticut-based Iroquois Gas Transmission System, a $524 million project to ship gas to utilities and power generators in New York and Connecticut. In addition, TransCanada PipeLines Ltd., Toronto, plans to spend $1.02 billion to expand its system to transport the gas to the U.S. border.    The vote is being held as producers demand better terms than they had received in the past and it is linked to a market of which producers have very high expectations, analysts say.    &quot;This is going to be a very, very close-run thing,&quot; said Dwight Curly, president of Burlington, Vt.-based Champlain Pipeline Operating Co.&quot;If producers reject these contracts . . . we're looking at significant delays or even the abandonment of the project,&quot; he said.    Champlain proposes to ship as much as 321.5 million cubic feet a day to New England, beginning in 1991. An additional 499 million cubic feet of gas daily would reach the Northeast via Iroquois.    Alberta producers have already rejected three contracts, negotiated by Pan-Alberta Gas, to ship gas on the Champlain system. All three have been sent back for a second vote, with pricing provisions of two sweetened.    Iroquois officials are &quot;cautiously optimistic,&quot; about today's vote on Western Gas Marketing's contract to supply a consortium of Northeast utilities with as much as 275 million cubic feet of gas daily via the Iroquois pipeline.    &quot;But there is still a lot of concern among producers as to whether this is the right market to serve, and there does still seem to exist a debate whether we need one or two pipelines to serve it,&quot; said Bob Reid, president of Iroquois.    Wooing producers, Iroquois hosted a gathering at a Rocky Mountains resort and discussed U.S. natural gas markets by telephone with U.S. congressional leaders.    Not to be outdone, Champlain drew 70 producers to a seminar featuring a satellite appearance by Massachussets Governor Michael Dukakis. The day ended with a dinner &quot;symbolic of this natural partnership: prime Alberta beef and fresh New England lobster.&quot;    Roger Berliner, a Washington-based gas market analyst and publisher of Crossborder Report, an industry newsletter, warned that the rejection of a contract shouldn't be interpreted as a rejection of the Northeast market.    A rejection is just a sign that &quot;the contracts aren't good enough,&quot; he said. Producers may feel prices are too low or object to future price increases linked to lowpriced alternative fuels like coal, he added. Two of the three previously-rejected Pan-Alberta contracts link the price of gas to coal as well as oil and other gas supplies. </TEXT></DOC>
