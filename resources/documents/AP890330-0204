Milken:</TEXT><HEAD>CRIMINAL CHARGES</HEAD><TEXT>   The nation's fifth-largest securities firm last December agreedto plead guilty to six felony counts for securities and mail fraudand pay a record $650 million in fines and restitution.   The charges brought by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattanincluded stock manipulation, fraudulent filings with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission and a stock ``parking'' scheme withnow-imprisoned inside trader Ivan Boesky.   Drexel said it agreed to the deal with the government ratherthan face a racketeering indictment that could have frozen itsassets and crippled its operations.   Under the deal, Drexel agreed to fire Michael Milken andwithhold his 1988 compensation, estimated at between $100 millionand $200 million. It agreed to similar terms for Milken's brother,Lowell, a Drexel executive.   The Milkens and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg werecharged Wednesday in a 98-count racketeering and securities fraudindictment handed up by a federal grand jury.   Drexel will not formally plead guilty under the criminal pleabargain until the firm settles civil charges with the SEC and afederal judge approves the deals.   The government began investigating Drexel and Milken in late1986 after the firm was named by Boesky, who agreed to pay $100million and cooperate with the government to settle insider tradingcharges against him.</TEXT><HEAD>CIVIL CHARGES</HEAD><TEXT>   The SEC last September accused Drexel, Milken and five others offraudulent schemes including insider trading, stock manipulation,failure to disclose stock ownership and other violations ofsecurities laws. The civil complaint says Milken schemed withBoesky in at least 16 transactions that violated securities laws.   Negotiations between Drexel and the SEC hit numerous roadblocksand stalled earlier this month when the government demanded thefirm fire Milken before the settlement was completed. One proposedcondition would bans Milken from the firm for life and bars otherDrexel employees from talking business with him.   The SEC deal is a precondition for settlement of criminalcharges against the firm.</TEXT><HEAD>MICHAEL MILKEN</HEAD><TEXT>   Milken has denied all allegations against him. He has been afocus of government investigators for more than two years.   The 42-year-old junk bond financier received a letter from thegovernment last fall indicating he would be indicted on chargesincluding racketeering and securities fraud.   Milken is challenging Drexel's criminal settlement in federalcourt, charging it violates his constitutional rights by forcingthe firm to fire him and withhold his 1988 pay. An April hearing isscheduled. The case is not expected to derail the plea agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
