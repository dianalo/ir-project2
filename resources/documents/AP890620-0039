(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   United Mine Workers President RichardTrumka, who brought a new era of peace to the coal industry,presides over a union embroiled in its biggest labor dispute sincehe took office seven years ago.   A 40-year-old lawyer and the son and grandson of Pennsylvaniacoal miners, Trumka has won respect from his members and from hisadversaries, the coal industry's top executives.   But some coal officials have complained that Trumka hasn't doneenough to to bring an end to a wildcat strike that began June 12 insouthern West Virginia and by this week had spread to Kentucky,Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Alabama, Illinois, Tennessee andMissouri, idling more than 27,000 miners.   The strikers say they won't go back until The Pittston Coal Groupsigns a contract with the union, which has been on strike againstthe company since April.   ``We have no control over Pittston. We have no control over Mr.Trumka. Yet we are being severely penalized by the strike. Ouremployees are being penalized,'' said Robert Quenon, chairman of theBituminous Coal Operators Association, the industry's mainbargaining unit.   ``I think the union leadership ought to exercise a leadershiprole and lead the miners back to work.''   Trumka and chief union spokesman Joe Corcoran did not returnrepeated phone calls over the past nine days seeking comment aboutthe strike.   On Monday, the union sent a telegram to miners advising them toreturn to work in accordance with a national labor contract signedby UMW members.   When Trumka assumed his job in 1982, he was the UMW's fourthpresident in 10 years.   His predecessors included Tony Boyle, who went to prison formurdering a union rival; Arnold Miller, whose health forced him toresign, leaving the union in disarray; and Sam Church Jr., who lostsupport when he negotiated a contract in 1981 that was rejected bythe rank-and-file, leading to a 72-day strike, just four years aftera 111-day walkout.   Trumka took over a union known for its street brawls among unionofficials and for widespread wildcats _ one over grievanceprocedures that idled 70,000 miners in 1975 _ which the UMW leadersappeared to be unable to control.   He worked to focus the membership's efforts less on internaldisputes and more on fighting the companies. He won broad new powersfrom the membership, including the union's first strike fund and theauthority to call selective strikes.   He used some of those powers to negotiate a contract in 1984without an industrywide strike, the first time in 20 years, andagain in 1988.   An indication of his support was his re-election withoutopposition in 1987 to a second five-year term.   ``You know, coal miners can get into knock-down and drag-outfights,'' said Local 340 President Frank Thurman in Cedar Grove.``But when the chips are down, we know who the adversary is. Theadversary is not within. The adversary is the coal operators whothink they can reverse time and take us back.''   Just before his re-election, Trumka discussed what he called theunion's newfound course.   ``We've become less reactionary,'' he said. ``The mine workersused to just wait for something to happen. Now, rather than justreacting to things, we're starting to plan.''   The union's strike against The Pittston Coal Group prompted lastweek's sympathy strike and is the second during Trumka's tenure.   The first was a 15-month walkout by 1,100 miners against the A.T.Massey Coal Co. in West Virginia and Kentucky, which ended with theunion accepting the company's offer and the company being split upby its owners. Local officials said neither side won.   With the Pittston strike, involving 1,800 miners in Virginia,West Virginia and Kentucky, the union has jeopardized its newfoundcooperative relationship _ and its $100 million strike fund.   A Virginia judge has ordered fines of $3 million because of theunion's campaign of civil disobedience, and three union officials,including strike coordinator Marty Hudson, were held for two weekswithout bail in the Roanoke, Va., City Jail for orchestrating thepicket-line activities. The three were released from jail Monday.   The union also has been named in several damage suits filed inU.S. District Court by companies that won back-to-work orders onlyto see the miners ignore them.</TEXT></DOC>
