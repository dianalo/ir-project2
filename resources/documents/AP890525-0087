It wasthe first time the Soviets had published detailed accusationsagainst the three.   ``Competent organs possess information that testifies to theinvolvement of these journalists with British intelligenceservices,'' KGB spokesman Vladimir Strunin told a news conference.   The British journalists _ Jeremy Harris of the BritishBroadcasting Corp., Ian Glover-James of Independent Television Newsand Angus Roxburgh of The Sunday Times _ have denied wrongdoing.   Glover-James and Roxburgh could not immediately be reached bytelephone to comment on the KGB charges. Harris declined commentuntil he had read the Tass news agency's report on Strunin'sallegations.   On Saturday the journalists, along with eight British diplomatsbased in Moscow, were given 14 days to leave the Soviet Union.Britain said the move was revenge for Britain's decision on Fridayto expel 11 London-based Soviets _ eight diplomats and threejournalists _ accused of spying.   The most serious accusation leveled today was against Roxburgh.The KGB accused him of trying to enlist a Soviet citizen to obtaininformation on unspecified ``government installations.''   ``To this end, (Roxburgh) gave him equipment for listening andrecording telephone conversations and also promised to pay amonetary reward for information that was interesting to him,'' theKGB spokesman alleged.   Strunin said the listening device was disguised as a householdappliance and could be also used to capture low-frequency magneticfields generated by telephone lines, cables and computers.   Roxburgh also was accused of violating regulations that restrictforeigners' travel in the Soviet Union.   In particular, Roxburgh allegedly traveled to the southernresort city of Yalta in July without giving the required 48 hours'advance notice to the Foreign Ministry.   ``Soon afterward, Roxburgh was detained during an attempt toenter a closed area in the Moscow region,'' the KGB charges said.   Harris ``on several occasions tried to enter zones closed toforeigners,'' according to the allegations. ``There is informationthat he used technical means for the gathering of information inthose areas.''   Glover-James was accused of ``demonstrating on numerousoccasions a heightened interest in installations of a militarycharacter that is unjustified for a journalist.''   He was also accused of repeatedly violating the regulations onforeigners' travel in Soviet territory.   Since the expulsions, the Soviets have said the number ofBritons allowed to work in Moscow will be cut from 375 to 205 _ thenumber of Soviets permitted to work in Britain.   In a separate Tass dispatch, Leonid Kravchenko, the officialSoviet news agency's general director, denied that the Tass Londoncorrespondent was involved in espionage and said his expulsionorder was ``regrettable.''   In a letter to British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe,Kravchenko said correspondent Igor Peskov was a professionaljournalist, not a spy.   ``Nothing in his activities has contradicted either British orinternational law, nor could they do any harm to the securityinterests of Britain,'' Kravchenko said in the letter, quoted byTass.   He said the expulsion of Peskov was at odds with improvedSoviet-British relations and could hinder future positivedevelopments between the countries.   The dispatch did not mention the other two Soviet journalistsexpelled.</TEXT></DOC>
