Smith (202) 632-0720,concerning questions about the changes in parts 430 and 540; Sharon C.Snellings, (202) 653-8551, concerning changes in part 432.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In addition to extending the PMRS toMarch 31, 1991, the Act modifies the formula used to determine merit increasesand establishes new procedures for dealing with employees who are performingbelow the fully successful level.The change in the merit increase determination procedures addresses theprocedural problem that caused a lack of parity between PMRS merit increasesand General Schedule within-grade increases for employees rated fully successfulin the middle third of the pay range. The new formula divides the PMRSpay range into three parts. Merit increases will be determined based onthe employee's performance rating and his/her basic pay compared to specificreference rates in the pay range (i.e., position in the range). The firstand second reference rates in the new formula equal the dollar amountsof the fourth and seventh steps of a General Schedule grade or specialrate range. All agencies must use the new formula in making their meritincrease determinations for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, effective as ofthe beginning of the first applicable pay period commencing on or afterOctober 1, 1989.The Act also requires agencies to provide a performance improvement plan(PIP) to each employee whose performance is determined to be below fullysuccessful. This requirement will take effect on October 1, 1989, and appliesto any performance determination (under 4302a(b)(4) of title 5, U.S.C.)given on or after that date. Further, the Act provides that employees coveredby the Performance Management and Recognition System may be reassigned,reduced in grade or removed if they fail to attain at least fully successfulperformance once they have been afforded a performance improvement plan.Accordingly, part 432 regulations are being revised to incorporate thesechanges concerning employees covered by the PMRS.Pursuant to section 553(b)(3)(B) of title 5 of the United States Code,I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposedrulemaking. The notice is being waived because Congress has provided thatPublic Law 101-103 is effective October 1, 1989, and accordingly, theseregulations must go into effect on that date.Pursuant to section 553(d)(3) of title 5 of the United States Code, I findthat good cause exists to make this amendment effective in less than 30days. These regulations are being made effective immediately because agenciesmust have rules in effect to implement the Performance Management and RecognitionSystem, under which certain actions are required to be taken on the firstday of the first pay period in October 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because the regulations willonly affect Government employees and agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>5 CFR Parts 430 and 432Administrative practice and procedure; Government employees.5 CFR Part 540Government employees; Wages.<ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Berry Newman,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, the Office of Personnel Management proposes to amend title5, chapter I, Code of Federal Regulations, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 430_PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT</ITAG>1.
