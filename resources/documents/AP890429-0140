But their biggest victory this past week came as a surprise _the announced pullout from South Africa of Mobil Corp., a diehardopponent of the divestment crusade and the biggest U.S. operationin that country. Mobil's move raised speculation that othercompanies would leave at an accelerated pace.   ``This was a difficult decision because we continue to believethat our presence and our actions have contributed greatly toeconomic and social progress for non whites in South Africa,''Mobil Chairman Allen E. Murray said in announcing the end of ninedecades of company operations in South Africa.   ``We are proud of what Mobil people have accomplished in SouthAfrica,'' he said. ``But we had to weigh business considerationsincluding the impact of recently enacted and proposed U.S.legislation and regulations which have made it more and moredifficult for us to be fully competitive there.''   Murray's announcement marked a stunning reversal for NewYork-based Mobil, the nation's sixth-largest industrial corporationand second-largest U.S. oil company behind Exxon Corp., whichvacated South Africa three years ago. Mobil had vowed it wouldnever capitulate to pressure to leave.   The Mobil news came a day after nearly a quarter of Unisysshareholders voted to sever business ties with South Africa at thecompany's annual meeting and four days after 14.5 percent of IBMshareholders did likewise.   Although those resolutions were defeated, the tallies reflectedthe growing strength of the South Africa divestment movement amongshareholders. A few years ago, such resolutions generally wonlittle more than a 3 percent vote.   Like many of the 170 American companies that have vacated SouthAfrica over the past four years, Mobil said its primary reason fordepartment was economic, not political.   But anti-apartheid activists noted Mobil's announcement cameless than two weeks before its annual meeting. Activistshareholders had placed two South African divestment resolutions onthe agenda.   ``There's no question it was partly designed to deflect theefforts of those shareholders,'' said Ibrahim Gassama, legislativedirector of Trans-Africa, a Washington-based lobby concern thatadvocates severing U.S. ties with South Africa.   Anti-apartheid activists also said they believed Mobil's movewas partly a delayed reaction to a tax change passed by Congress in1987. That reform, introduced by Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.,eliminated corporate deductions for income taxes paid to SouthAfrica.   Some activists believe the Rangel reform has removed what theycall an excuse many U.S. companies use for justifying theirpresence in South Africa: they do more good there battling racialinjustice than they would by leaving.   As Mobil's departure shows, Gassama contended, ``We realize nowthey were not there for South Africans. They were there for themoney. Rangel must be congratulated because he flushed out thisfacade.''   In other business and economic news this past week:   _Government figures suggested the economy is slowing. The Marchindex of leading indicators fell 0.7 percent; consumer spendingrose only 0.2 percent the same month and durable goods orders fromfactories rose only 0.8 percent, mostly from aircraft orders thatfluctuate sharply from month to month. Financial markets rallied onthe numbers because they were interpreted as a sign the FederalReserve won't raise interest rates further to slow the economy andcurb inflation.   _Several major companies reported sharp first-quarter earningsincreases. Airline giants UAL Corp., Delta Air Lines and USAirGroup Inc. enjoyed a surge in earnings due to higher fares; BoeingCo. reported an 18 percent jump that underscored its record ordersfor new planes; Sears Roebuck andamp; Co. showed a 56 percent rise thatsignaled a possible turnaround at the nation's biggest retailer;Ford Motor Co.'s record first-quarter earnings reflected betterresults at its overseas operations.   _Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. sold half its retail brokeragenetwork to Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., part of a previouslyannounced restructuring plan in the aftermath of Drexel'ssecurities-fraud settlement pact with the Securities and ExchangeCommission. Another scandal-tainted securities firm, Matthews andamp;Wright Group Inc., settled fraud charges with the SEC bysurrendering its bond-peddling license.</TEXT><TEXT>   End advance for weekend editions April 29-30</TEXT></DOC>
