Natural gas has several features that distinguishit from oil. Most importantly, gas pipelines are relatively expensiveand have large economies of scale. Additionally, for most countries gasmust be sold on internal markets, usually to state monopsony buyers.The foreign oil company must therefore become involved in a close andlong-term relationship with the relevant state agencies. The nature ofthe bilateral relationship between oil company and state during a gasproject are outlined. Long-term development contracts and the clausesthat deal with this relationship are discussed. In addition contractterms to encourage exploration, including concession terms, are reviewed.Optimal contract forms and likely requirements for future gas projectsare considered.</TEXT></DOC>
