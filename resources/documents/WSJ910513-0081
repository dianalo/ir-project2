But those are in Bonn, a comfortable city onthe banks of the Rhine that spy novelist John Le Carre dubbed&quot;A Small Town in Germany.&quot;   Ever since the Cold War split this nation, isolatingBerlin deep inside Communist East Germany, many Germansdreamed of restoring their prewar capital. Unity made itimaginable, but not easily attainable.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, breaking months of silence on theissue, recently joined a growing list of top officials whoopenly endorse moving to Berlin. But an equally strong waveof opposition has mounted, citing cost factors and the legacyof Berlin as the seat of Hitler's Third Reich, as reasons tostick with Bonn.   German officials say privately that a likely solution issome division of duties between the two, with Bonn remainingthe main center of power until the end of this decade. Mr.Kohl, speaking to a closed meeting of his conservativeChristian Democrats at Berlin's historic Reichstag recently,predicted the move might take 10 to 15 years. He also pointedout that some key functions should remain in Bonn, such asthe Defense Ministry.   Berlin's conservative mayor, Eberhard Diepgen, praised thechancellor for finally taking a side, but pointed out thatthe final decision remains open. The German news media haspredicted for days that Mr. Kohl was about to disclose his&quot;secret sympathies&quot; for Berlin. The choice of where to placethe government is &quot;a decision where there can't be any winneror loser,&quot; said Mr. Kohl.   But don't try telling that to the groups that have sprungup to support their respective choices for capital. The issuehas sparked an overwrought domestic debate, touching oneverything from Germany's vision of its future to how totreat the nation's dark past. When Germany's popularPresident, Richard von Weizsaecker -- a former mayor of WestBerlin -- called for a quick decision in favor of Berlin, hewas pounced on by critics from his own Christian Democraticparty as well as opposition Social Democrats. Bonn boosterson both sides of the the political spectrum said thepresident had no authority to comment on the issue.   &quot;This isn't the sort of question that people have halfwayopinions about,&quot; says Jochen Thies, editor of Europa-Archiv,an international affairs journal based in Bonn. &quot;Eitherthey're strongly in favor of the one or the other.&quot; Mr. Thiesis no exception. He thinks choosing Bonn would be &quot;a pinnacleof stupidity.&quot;   But even those eager to move to Berlin acknowledge thecity has problems. Germany's largest urban center is stillsurrounded on all sides by Soviet troops and the region'sinfrastructure is in shambles. Or rather, half of Berlin'sinfrastructure is in shambles. The western side of the cityremains an enclave of relative wealth, while the eastern sideis suffering from the same devastating economic declinegripping the rest of eastern Germany.   That's why Sabine Bergmann-Pohl says it's vital to chooseBerlin. Ms. Bergmann-Pohl, the leader of East Germany's lastfreely elected Parliament and now a member of Bonn'sBundestag, says pouring investment into remaking Berlin intoa capital would spark redevelopment of the region. &quot;It wouldbe a signal to the eastern part of Germany,&quot; she says,&quot;showing that this government believes in the future of theentire country.&quot;   Gazing out her office window across the manicured lawnsand flowerbeds of Bonn's main government quarter, however,Ms. Bergmann-Pohl also makes no secret of the fact that shefinds the current seat of the German government, well,boring. &quot;It's as if London were the capital,&quot; she says, &quot;butthe government was stuck in some country village inScotland.&quot;   Such putdowns don't faze Bonn enthusiasts. Indeed, thosewho support Bonn's aspirations say they like the city becauseof its compact size and what one Bonn newspaper editor hasproclaimed the town's &quot;lack of pretentions to power.&quot; In1949, it seemed like the perfect place to Konrad Adenauer,West Germany's first postwar chancellor, to set up a&quot;temporary capital,&quot; an antithesis to Berlin's grandioseboulevards and just a short drive away from his home innearby Rhoendorf.   Over the decades, Bonn's status as a temporary solutionwas firmly endorsed by successive West German governments.But the place has grown to suit its purpose. Buildings thatwere constructed as temporary quarters have been graduallyreplaced or upgraded, while a building boom that began justbefore the Berlin Wall opened is still reshaping the city.Bonn will soon open a new plenary hall for Parliament as wellas a national art museum and a museum of West German history.   The pro-Bonn lobby argues that the town offers everythingGermany needs in a capital. They also stir dark images of aresurgent Germany heading back toward the city where Hitleris buried. Luigi Vittorio Ferraris, a former Italianambassador to Bonn who's become one of the town's moreunlikely advocates, says that choosing Berlin would send the&quot;wrong signal&quot; to the rest of Europe and constitute a &quot;birthdefect for the new country.&quot;   As for the cost, both sides muster figures that supporttheir positions. Berlin advocates say the move could be donefor as little as 6 billion marks ($3.46 billion). After all,the city is full of disused East German government buildings.But Bonn backers have come up with estimates as high as 125billion marks.   A study conducted for the city of Bonn by westernGermany's Prognos AG consulting agency came up with thefigure of 50 to 60 billion marks, but about half of thatinvolves the economic losses that would be suffered by Bonnand its surrounding territory.   But whatever the cost, the debate over Germany's capitalis still far from reaching its climax. Members of Parliamentare thought to be roughly divided over the issue, with manylawmakers from western German states supporting Bonn, whilemost eastern German lawmakers favor Berlin. The Bundestag isexpected to vote on the issue by the end of June. Meanwhile,the public endorsement by Mr. Kohl could tip the scales.</TEXT></DOC>
