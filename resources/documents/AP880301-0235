On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediatecrude for April delivery settled at $16.01 per 42-gallon barrelMonday, up 23 cents from Friday's close.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale heatingoil for March delivery gained 1.46 cents to 47.16 cents per gallonand wholesale unleaded gasoline gained .45 cent to 45.71 cents pergallon.   Analysts said several days of bad weather in Europe and coolerthan normal temperatures in the northeastern United States hadtouched off the heavy buying in heating oil.   Storms reported in the North Sea also prompted some buying amongoil companies hedging against a slowdown in production, theanalysts said.   ``The market is testing to see if we have bargain prices,'' saidBob Baker, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Baker said last week's reports speculating about excessproduction by members of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries, which helped depress crude prices, may have beenoverblown.   ``There is still a lot of oil out there, but whether it's a bigexcess or a little excess is what we're trying to find out,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
