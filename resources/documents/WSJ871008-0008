The fifth increase this year brought the prime rate to the highest level in more than 1 1/2 years.    Most other short-term interest rates held steady yesterday. But in the bond market, prices of long-term Treasury issues slumped in the afternoon, and yields rose to nearly their highest levels of the year.    Bond traders were surprised and disappointed by the results of the government's sale yesterday of $6.76 billion of seven-year Treasury notes. The average annual yield was 9.51%, up from 8.1% at the previous auction in June and the highest in nearly two years. Earlier in the day, many traders anticipated a yield of 9.48% on the notes.    Chase Manhattan Bank initiated the latest increase in the prime, or base, rate on corporate loans, and soon had plenty of company. Bankers said the move was caused by recent increases in their own borrowing costs, and many predicted further increases in coming months.    &quot;Originally, I thought the prime rate would get to 10% by next spring, but now I think it will get there by this Christmas,&quot; said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. He predicts the Federal Reserve will tighten credit further in the next few months to combat rising inflationary pressure, and that the prime rate will surge to 11% by the middle of next year.    Mr. Kellner expects the Federal Reserve to raise its discount rate &quot;within a few days.&quot; Early last month, the Fed raised the discount rate, the fee it charges on loans to banks and savings institutions, to 6%, saying this reflected its intent &quot;to deal effectively and in a timely way with potential inflation pressures.&quot;    Others argue that the Fed probably won't take any further action just yet. &quot;I think the Fed will hold out raising the discount rate until there's (another) serious rout in the bond market,&quot; said Susan Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. However, she said the economy is &quot;very buoyant,&quot; and &quot;that means the big risk is for higher rates.&quot;    Ms. Hering and other analysts said that the prime rate usually is a lagging indicator of rates in general and not necessarily a sign of what lies ahead.    Nevertheless, prime rate increases can send ripples throughout the economy because the prime is used by banks as a base rate on loans to many small and medium-size businesses. Bankers also use it as a benchmark for rates on some types of consumer loans, notably home equity loans. Analysts say the latest round of prime rate increases should help boost banks' fourth-quarter earnings.    The nation's largest companies can afford to pay little attention to prime rate changes. Bankers are willing to offer them significantly lower rates in an effort to keep them from turning to alternative sources of credit, such as the booming commercial paper market.    &quot;I don't think anyone was particularly surprised&quot; by the prime rate increase, said Jeffrey R. Leeds, a managing director at Chemical Bank. &quot;It certainly reflected the rise in short-term rates recently.&quot; Mr. Leeds isn't so sure additional prime rate increases are coming. &quot;Although it seems the market has already anticipated a move in Federal Reserve policy, I'm not convinced that's inevitable,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't believe an imminent tightening by the Federal Reserve is in order.&quot;    Even if the Federal Reserve tightens credit further, most analysts contend the economy will continue chugging along at a moderate clip for at least the next year. But a few, such as Milton Friedman, say the outlook isn't so bright.    Mr. Friedman, in a speech here yesterday, said he is very concerned about the anemic growth of the nation's money supply in recent months. If money growth remains weak for the next three to six months, &quot;Then I believe the odds of a recession beginning within the next year get very high indeed,&quot; said Mr. Friedman, who won the 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science.    Federal Reserve officials appear to be paying little or no attention to the money figures in setting credit policy, focusing instead mainly on the dollar and broad economic trends. They and many private economists argue that the money supply no longer is a reliable indicator of where the economy and inflation are heading.    But Mr. Friedman said yesterday this view is &quot;nonsense,&quot; and that the money supply is just as important as ever. &quot;I want to put to rest that canard&quot; that the money supply doesn't matter, he said. He renewed his appeal to the Fed to maintain slow and steady growth of the money supply -- and to resist the temptation &quot;to try to fine-tune the economy.&quot;    The bond market's late afternoon slump yesterday left the new issue market in disarray as underwriters struggled to sell several large offerings. &quot;The market turned against us and that made for slower sales,&quot; said an official at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    A $150 million issue of Tokyo notes due October 1997 was the only new offering yesterday considered successful, according to underwriters. A syndicate led by First Boston Corp. priced the 10 3/8% notes at par, or 0.65 percentage point more than the Treasury's 10-year note. The issue is rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Other large issues encountered investor resistance, including:    --A $250 million issue of Hydro-Quebec debentures due October 2007. Underwriters led by First Boston priced the 10.7% debentures at 99.106 to yield 10.81%, or 1.05 percentage points more than the Treasury's 30-year bond. The offering is rated double-A-3 by Moody's and double-A-minus by Sandamp;P.    --A $100 million issue of Philadelphia Electric Co. first and refunding mortgage bonds due October 2016. Underwriters led by Drexel Burnham priced the 12 1/8% bonds after competitive bidding at 99.405 to yield 12.2%, or 2.48 percentage points more than the Treasury's 30-year bond. The issue is rated Baa-3 by Moody's and triple-Bminus by Sandamp;P.    --A $100 million issue of Philadelphia Electric first and refunding mortgage bonds due October 1997. Underwriters led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. priced the bonds after competitive bidding at par to yield 11%, or 1.35 percentage points more than the Treasury's 10-year note.    In the bond market, the latest 30-year government issue, the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017, slumped to a price of 91 from 91 3/8 Tuesday, as the yield rose to 9.81% from 9.77%. Early in the day, the bonds traded as high as 91 3/4. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 3.27 points to 1167.74. It ranged between 1165.67 and 1179.61.    The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 fell to 93 from 93 3/8 as the yield increased to 9.74% from 9.68%.    Rates were little changed on short-term Treasury bills. The rate on the government's new 13-week bills was unchanged at 6.52% bid. The rate on the new 26-week bills rose to 6.95% bid from 6.92% Tuesday.    The rate on federal funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged 7.27% yesterday, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That was down from 7.32% Tuesday.    Here are the results of yesterday's auction of seven-year government notes:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
