The Ivy League schools agreed to settle the unusual civilantitrust charges by promising not to collude in the futureon financial aid, tuition levels or faculty salaries. MITdeclined to join the settlement, and Attorney General DickThornburgh vowed to bring the prestigious institute to trial.</LP><TEXT>   The government's charges and the settlement, announced byMr. Thornburgh, don't conclude a wide-ranging antitrustinvestigation of financial practices in higher education. Atleast 48 additional schools have been investigated by theJustice Department; Mr. Thornburgh said that probe iscontinuing.   The two-year investigation reflects the JusticeDepartment's belief that steep tuition increases over thepast two decades reflect illegal collusion among colleges anduniversities -- especially among elite institutions, such asthe Ivy League schools. The average tuition at privatefour-year universities rose nearly fivefold between the1971-72 and 1989-90 school years to $10,400. The consumerprice index in the same period rose threefold. The nineschools charged all cost more than $18,500 for the 1989-90year.   The defendant schools didn't admit to any wrongdoing. Theycontinued to defend their longstanding policy of settingstandard financial-aid rates as a means of ensuring thattalented needy students wouldn't be influenced by financialconcerns when deciding where to go to college. Harvard'sgeneral counsel, Daniel Steiner, complained that competitionamong schools giving financial aid would result in excessiveawards and the diversion of &quot;scarce financial aid funds . . .from serving the broadest number of needy students.&quot;   Mark Wrighton, MIT's provost, said the school declined tosettle because officials there &quot;don't believe that ourpractices violated the antitrust laws.&quot;   Mr. Thornburgh countered that &quot;students and their familiesare entitled to the full benefits of price competition whenthey choose a college. This collegiate cartel denied them theright to compare prices and discounts among schools, just asthey would in shopping for any other service.&quot; The attorneygeneral declined to predict whether the government's actionwould slow the pace of tuition increases.   In addition to Harvard and MIT, the schools named in theJustice Department's lawsuit were: Brown University, ColumbiaUniversity, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, PrincetonUniversity, the University of Pennsylvania and YaleUniversity.   The government charged that the nine schools conspiredduring a series of annual meetings collectively known as&quot;overlap.&quot; School officials have defended the overlapprocess, but voluntarily canceled it this year in an attemptto mollify the Justice Department.   At the meetings, the schools agreed on a general formulafor determining financial aid offers. Later, the schoolsagreed on the specific amounts that would be offered tostudents admitted to more than one of the participatinginstitutions. The overlap group also agreed not to awardscholarships based on attributes other than financial need,such as academic achievement.   The Justice Department also investigated allegations thatmany elite colleges and universities collude on tuition ratesand on faculty salary increases. Although the Ivy Leagueschools agreed not to discuss these matters in the future,the Justice Department didn't formally charge them withviolations related to tuition or salaries. Mr. Thornburghrefused to explain this omission, saying he was moreconcerned about the defendants' future conduct than aboutpast violations. The schools have denied even discussingtuition and faculty salaries.   Yesterday's settlement states it &quot;will neither impair norassist&quot; the bringing of private antitrust lawsuits againstthe defendant schools. One such suit has already been broughtby a student at Wesleyan University in Connecticut; theplaintiff is seeking class-action status on behalf of about100,000 students.   The Justice Department filed the settlement in a federalcourt in Philadelphia, which must approve the agreement forit to take effect.</TEXT></DOC>
