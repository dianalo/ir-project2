For the quarter, Middle South reported earnings of $88.8 million, or 43 cents a share, down from $94.4 million, or 46 cents a share. Revenue declined 1.4%, to $819.7 million from $831.6 million.    The New Orleans-based utility holding company said its earnings fell because of decreased electricity sales and a previously announced lower return on equity granted by regulators for the Middle South unit owning the $3.6 billion Grand Gulf 1 nuclear plant in Port Gibson, Miss.    For the six months, net income dropped 7.2% to $181 million, or 88 cents a share, from $195.2 million, or 95 cents a share. Revenue rose slightly to $1.61 billion from $1.60 billion. The year-ago six-month figures were restated to reflect an accounting change.    Middle South's finances have been hurt for the past three years by rate increases that the company says have been too meager to cover the costs of Grand Gulf and its $2.8 billion Waterford nuclear plant, near New Orleans. Such rulings by regulators, who are elected by an impoverished constituency, have frequently sent Middle South into the courts for help.    The high court ruling on June 24 overturned a state ruling denying Middle South's Mississippi Power andamp; Light Co. unit a $326 million rate boost. The jurists ruled that state utility regulators must abide by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission actions that not only set wholesale rates, but also allocate resources among the many electric companies that are part of federally regulated power pools.    The ruling will ease Middle South's &quot;financial uncertainty&quot; and will allow the company to borrow at lower interest rates, Middle South said. The brighter financial picture &quot;raises the possibility of resuming at least some level of common stock dividend payout by year's end,&quot; the company said in a statement. Middle South, after 144 uninterrupted quarters, omitted its 44.5-cent dividend in July 1985 and hasn't paid one since.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Middle South stock was down 12.5 cents yesterday, to $13.375. </TEXT></DOC>
