The authors investigated whether cellsurvival is altered if variations in cell density occur only during theheat treatment. The survival of CHO cells was determined after heat treatment(45{sup 0}, 20 min) at varying cell density (1x10/sup 4/ - 1x10/sup 7/cells/T-25 flask). Cellular multiplicity was varied independently ofcell density and evaluated as well as conditioning of the medium at thetime of heating. In parallel studies, cells were plated in the presenceof feeder cells, allowed to attach 0-6 hr, heated and then incubatedfor colony formation. The results indicate that cell survival is directlyrelated to cell density at the time of heating or during the first fewminutes of recovery.</TEXT></DOC>
