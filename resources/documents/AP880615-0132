RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today expanded the financialliability of promoters of business deals that turn sour.   The justices, voting 7-1, ruled that a Texas oilman may not haveto bear full financial liability for selling unregistered oil andgas leases. The court said a promoter of the deal, who also boughtthe securities himself, may be forced to share liability.   The court overturned a ruling that favored the promoter andordered further lower court study of the case.   Today's ruling also favors the Securities and ExchangeCommission, which argued that promoters who are not themselvessellers of securities should not be immune from penalties in suchcases.   The ruling is at least a partial victory for Billy ``B.J.''Pinter, head of Black Gold Oil Co., who sold oil and gas rights inTexas and Oklahoma to a group of investors in 1981.   Maurice Dahl, a California real estate broker, was instrumentalin putting the deal together. Dahl was convinced the leases wouldbe lucrative and promoted their sale to his friends and familymembers.   When the leases proved worthless, the investors _ including Dahl_ sued Pinter.   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1986 that Pinterviolated federal law by failing to register the securities. Theappeals court upheld a federal judge's ruling that Pinter mustreimburse the investors for their losses plus interest.   Pinter said that Dahl, because he promoted the investment, ishimself a ``seller'' of securities who should be forced to sharethe cost of reimbursement.   The 5th Circuit court, noting that Dahl did not receive acommission for promoting the deal, said he was more a buyer than aseller.   But the Supreme Court today ordered further hearings to explorethat issue.   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the court, said it isunclear ``whether Dahl urged the other purchases in order tofurther some financial interest of his own or of Pinter.''   Moreover, Blackmun said, there must be further study todetermine ``whether Dahl bears at least substantially equalresponsibility for the failure to register the oil and gasinterests or to distribute the securities in a manner thatconformed'' with federal law.   There is conflicting evidence about the nature of Dahl's role,Blackmun said.   He said there is evidence, on one hand, that Dahl initiated theentire investment and loaned money to Pinter to make the dealpossible, but on the other hand there is also evidence that Dahlinvested more money in the deal than other investors whom he urgedto participate.   A person in Dahl's position must share financial liability forsale of unregistered securities if his role ``is more as a promoterthan as an investor,'' Blackmun said.   Justice John Paul Stevens was the lone dissenter. JusticeAnthony M. Kennedy did not take part in the case.   The case is Pinter vs. Dahl, 86-805.</TEXT></DOC>
