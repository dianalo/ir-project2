The decline was limited, however, by traders' caution ahead of this weekend's meeting of finance officials from the U.S. and its major allies.    Speculation about Japanese interest rates was fueled by a report that Japan's central bank has begun to commit itself to a tighter monetary policy to fight a possible resurgence of inflation. The discount rate is the rate the Bank of Japan charges on loans to major commercial banks.    Higher Japanese interest rates would narrow the difference in yields between the U.S. and Japan and tend to make U.S. investments relatively less attractive.    The report on Nikkei Telecom, a news service of the Japanese business newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun, quoted Bank of Japan officials as saying that as a first step, the central bank will limit growth of commercial lending. The report also said the central bank will allow interest rates in the money market to move upward.    Recent remarks by Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita seem to lend some credibility to the report. The chief banker said Monday, &quot;We are increasingly concerned about the price and lending situation.&quot;    He also said, &quot;It's necessary to take a kind of cautious monetary stance that stresses a closer watch over prices while continuing to pay attention to exchangerate movements.&quot;    The Bank of Japan's discount rate currently stands at 2.5%. The U.S. discount rate on loans to financial institutions is 6%.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 143.45 Japanese yen, compared with 143.97 Wednesday. It also fell to 1.8179 West German marks from 1.8224.    The absence of many participants for the Rosh Hashana holiday reduced trading volume.    The dollar was quoted at 143.25 yen in early Tokyo trading today.    Caution among dealers ahead of this weekend's Washington meeting of finance officials from the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy acted as a counterweight to any dollar-selling yesterday. The ministers and central bank chiefs are expected to renew the Louvre agreement reached in Paris in February, which commits the nations to cooperate on economic policies and to take measures aimed at stabilizing exchange rates. The accord has been credited for the dollar's relative stability since early this year.    Charles A. Spence, vice president, foreign exchange, at First Interstate Bank of California, Los Angeles, said officials from West Germany, Britain and Japan already have indicated an interest in maintaining the Louvre accord.    &quot;That's three of the major players,&quot; he said. &quot;One then asks what the U.S. wants for the dollar. If we look at the activity of the Fed in the past few weeks, it can be inferred that the Fed wants a stable dollar as well, since they just increased the discount rate.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 10 cents an ounce to $462.10 in light trading. Estimated volume was two million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $462.55 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                 Thursday, Sept. 24, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
