Three tugs will push the 456-foot long Merrimac, which resemblesa 12-story grey box, 208 miles up the Mississippi River in lateApril or early May, depending on river conditions, Wismar said.   The structure _ actually a power plant enclosed in a dam _ is somassive it will have to be partially sunk near Baton Rouge to allowit to pass under a bridge, but Wisner said no trouble was expectedduring the four- to five-day journey.   ``We will ballast it down to get under the bridge, probably byabout 50-feet or five stories... We have installed a temporaryballast system and 24 pumps to pump the water back out when we'repast the bridge,'' Wismar said.   A 106-foot deep hole has been prepared at the flooded site ofthe new plant between the Mississippi and Red Rivers about 40 milesbelow Vidalia. Once the plant is floated onto the site, a leveewill be rebuilt, the water drained off and the plant permanentlygrounded.   The eight-turbine power plant is expected to begin generatingelectricity by 1990.   The brainchild of former Vidalia mayor, Sidney Murray Jr., theplant is intended to produce cheap electricity for the 6,800Vidalia residents and help generate jobs and prosperity for thetown, which has been hit hard by depressed oil and farmingindustries.   ``When we started all of this we had 22 percent unemployment inour area,'' Murray said Thursday.   ``What I really wanted to do back them was just try to stabilizeenergy prices,'' he said. ``...I think we can do that when theplant gets going and I think it will attract some industry to ourarea.''   Skyrocketing oil prices in past years sent rates for electricityfrom local oil-fired power plants soaring. Rates never receded whenoil prices did and expectations were that if oil prices rosestrongly again in coming years the electric rates again wouldfollow suit.   The plant will produce enough electricity for over 200,000homes. Vidalia is entitled to between 6 percent and 15 percent ofthe electricy, enough to supply its residents.   When the debt for building the $500 million facility is paid offin 41 years through plant revenue, Vidalia will begin receiving athird of the money from the sale of power and can set localelectric rates.   The other two partners are Catalyst Energy DevelopmentCorporation of New York and Dominion Capital Inc. of Virginia.   Catalyst is a wholly owned subsidiary of Merrimac Inc., aprivately-held corporation principally owned by Tom B. Pickens III,son of the noted corporate raider T. Boone Pickens. Merrimac andits related companies have 18 operating facilities in 13 states and10 more projects under construction.   Local officials expect the population of Vidalia to double incoming years as more businesses move to a 280-acre industrial parkaimed at capitalizing on the new source of power.   City officials and a lot of what Murray called ``regularresidents'' planned to journey to New Orleans for Saturday'sceremonies, he said.   ``It's been 13 years, and I think they want to actually see itso they'll really believe it's going to happen now,'' Murray said.</TEXT></DOC>
