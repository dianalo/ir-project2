Chinese citizens, who have seen the signs before, face what couldbe the worst state backlash against free thought since the 1966-76Cultural Revolution.   Already, Chinese sources say police are arresting intellectualswho supported the seven-week-long student movement. Authoritiesannounced Saturday that 400 people, including student leaders, hadbeen rounded up for agitation.   Hundreds of people in cities outside Beijing also have beenarrested in the unrest following last Sunday's military attack inBeijing that left up to 3,000 people dead.   Student leaders who demanded democratic reforms, press freedomand an end to government corruption have been branded ascounterrevolutionaries and told to turn themselves in.   Activists charged with the same crime after the ``DemocracyWall'' movement of 1978-79 were imprisoned for up to 15 years.   Many Chinese intellectuals, usually the first to suffer when theCommunist Party asserts its authority, have gone underground.   Some student leaders also are in hiding; a few are believed tohave fled to embassies. Fang Lizhi, China's leading dissident, issheltered at the U.S. Embassy.   ``We now live in terror,'' said one student.   Show trials, like the one for Mao Tse-tung's widow, Jiang Qing,and her leftist Gang of Four after the Cultural Revolution are apossibility. Executions of some people accused of attacking policeor soldiers seem certain.   However, relatively few leading dissidents may face criminalcharges. Instead, they could be suppressed in a more subtle campaignof fear and reprisal that also would affect the lives of millions ofChinese.   Workers already have been docked pay and threatened withdismissal for participating in demonstrations.   The government has begun a massive propaganda campaign to drumhome the belief that the military carried out the will of the massesin attacking unarmed protesters. The official press insists that notone shot was fired when troops stormed Tiananmen Square in Beijinglast Sunday.   Thousands of reporters had joined the students in calling forpress freedom. For one heady moment, they were permitted to printwhat they saw as the truth.   Now, the press is once again a conduit for officialpronouncements.   One Chinese reporter expressed surprise when a foreigner askedfor a copy of the party's People's Daily. ``There's no news in it,''he said.   Repression of free thought has been a fixture of communist rulein China.   In 1957, leader Mao Tse-tung lured critics into the open with theslogan: ``Let 100 flowers bloom; let 100 schools of thoughtcontend.'' Within months, he banished thousands of freethinkers toprison and re-education camps.   Many victims eventually returned to their lives, only to becaught up in the orgy of violence of the Cultural Revolution. Peoplewere persecuted for their intellectual background, their work with aforeign company, speaking a foreign language or traveling abroad.   Tiananmen Square, the symbolic heart of China, is itself nostranger to government repression. In 1976, security forces stormedthe square and killed about 100 people protesting an attempt byMao's wife and other leftists to seize power.   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, himself disgraced during theCultural Revolution, took power in the late 1970s. He promised thenthat ideological struggles would no longer interfere with China'surgent need to fight poverty and modernize.   Last week was not the first time Deng has used force, however.   When Democracy Wall leaders began to question one-party rule intheir daring posters, Deng imprisoned dozens of people.   He responded to pro-democracy student demonstrations 2{ years agoby purging party chief Hu Yaobang, a reformer and his designatedsuccessor. Hu's death in April touched off the new round of protests.   Despite his oft-quoted remark that China will have to let in afew flies when it opens its windows to the world, he stands firmlyagainst what he calls ``spiritual pollution'' from the West.   Deng and other old-guard conservatives who back him also share adeep-seated phobia of political unrest.   Still, the Chinese people returned this spring to reassert theirdemands for greater freedom. They are bound to do so again afterthis new crisis.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Jim Abrams is Beijing bureau chief for TheAssociated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
