The Irish governmentsaid it was ``gravely perturbed'' at the shootings.   Youths in Belfast pelted police with gasoline bombs and setablaze several dozen automobiles in rioting that lasted into earlytoday, police said. No injuries were reported.   It was one of the worst nights of violence in the British-ruledprovince since last summer, and was touched off by the shooting oftwo men and a woman Sunday in Britain's fortress colony on Spain'ssouthern coast.   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said Monday that a``dreadful terrorist act has been averted'' by the slayings.   ``The three people killed were actively involved in the planningand attempted execution of that act,'' he told the House of Commonsin London.   Police in Gibraltar said the three were believed to be involvedin an Irish Republican Army plan to detonate a car bomb at thegovernor's residence during a ceremonial changing of the guardtoday.   Fifty members of the Royal Anglian Regiment, just transferredfrom duty in Northern Ireland, took part in the ceremony whichoccurred without incident.   Security was heavy as Gibraltar police and British troops withdogs patrolled the fringes of a crowd of about 300 tourists andresidents who watched the colorful ceremony in front of TheConvent, official residence of Governor Sir Peter Terry.   The IRA, which is fighting a guerrilla war to drive the Britishfrom Northern Ireland, acknowledged that the three guerrillas wereon a mission but accused the British government of needlesslykilling them.   In Dublin, Prime Minister Charles Haughey's government said itrecognized the need for security forces ``to take all reasonablemeasures to combat terrorism.''   ``The government is, however, gravely perturbed that threeunarmed Irish people should have been shot dead ... when it appearsfrom reports that they could have been arrested by the securityforces,'' the government said.   Ireland is already embroiled in a series of disputes withBritain over security forces in Northern Ireland, includingBritain's unwillingness to prosecute police officers who allegedlycarried out a shoot-to-kill policy in the province.   Howe said the soldiers opened fire after the guerrillas parked aRenault-5 with Spanish license plates near the governor's residenceand headed on foot for the Spanish border 800 yards away.   Howe said the three guerrillas ``made movements which ledsecurity personnel to believe their lives were in danger.''   Police searched Gibraltar and adjacent Spanish territory onMonday for another car believed connected with the three. Thetheory is the Renault-5 was reserving a space for a car bomb.   Howe said Spanish police tipped off the British after a fourthIRA guerrilla they were watching crossed into Gibraltar, apparentlyto carry out ``reconnaissance for an act of terrorism.''   The London newspaper the Daily Mail said Spanish police believethe fourth suspect may be Evelyn Glenholmes, who has been linkedwith several IRA attacks in past years. It quoted them as saying awomen of her description was seen visiting the other three at anapartment in Malaga, two hours' drive from Gibraltar.   Howe said a car for which the three slain guerrillas had keyswas found parked on the Spanish side of the gate separating this2.25-square-mile limestone rock from the Spanish mainland. He saidit contained keys to a third car, three false passports andequipment including an alarm clock, insulating tape and wire thatcould be used to detonate a bomb.   Howe did not identify the British unit involved, but there wasspeculation they were from the elite Special Air Services Regiment,whose movements are secret. Witnesses said they wore jeans.   The outlawed IRA, in a statement from Belfast, identified thedead as: Mairead Farrell, 31, who had served 10 years jail forblowing up a hotel, Sean Savage, 24, and Daniel McCann, 30, both ofwhom have been arrested on explosive charges.   All three were from Catholic West Belfast, where the riotingbroke out after Howe's statement.   In Belfast, police fired plastic bullets to disperse gangs ofyouths who hurled gasoline bombs and set fire to 30 vehiclesincluding buses, vans and trucks. Gunmen launched at least twosniper attacks on police and troops, police said.   The mainly Catholic IRA seeks to drive the British from NorthernIreland and unite the predominantly Protestant province with theoverwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic under socialist rule.</TEXT></DOC>
