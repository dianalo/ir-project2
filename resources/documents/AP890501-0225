The little round computer screen to be added to airlinercockpits, with its ping-pong-ball images and its limitedvocabulary, may not look like much to a generation numbed byNintendo computer games.   But ``TCASII'' is the latest acronym in aviation safety.   At more than $100,000 each, the second generation of the TrafficAlert Collision Avoidance System is also the latest pricey optionfor the corporate jet.   The system allows pilots to see the proximity of up to 30aircraft around them, warns verbally when one gets too close andeven announces in a computer voice exactly what the pilots shoulddo to avoid a collision: ``climb, climb'' or ``descend, descend.''   The collision avoidance system operates independently ofground-based Air Traffic Control operations and would serve as abackup to warn pilots of any problem that might be missed by thecontroller.   Attention has been focused on possible midair collisionsrecently, with nine operational errors involving close-flyingaircraft handled by a major southern California facility whichbrought National Transportation Safety Board warnings last week andreports of two near misses by airliners flying over New York.   Only the smallest planes, with no radar beacons to show theirlocation, would be invisible to the new system.   In a recent demonstration in the skies over northern Virginia, aSabreliner 65 piloted by Tommy Littlejohn, flight operationsdirector for TCAS manufacturer Bendix-King, came within a quartermile horizontally and 600 feet vertically of an oncoming BeechcraftBaron that was part of the demonstration.   Passengers inside the plane saw the Baron flash by afterLittlejohn followed the voice command and climbed several hundredfeet for a safe separation.   ``Once you fly with it, you don't want to fly without it,'' saidM. Ace Card, Bendix-King program manager for TCAS, who was aboardthe Sabreliner.   Systems built by Honeywell Inc. tested successfully in twoNorthwest Airlines planes, according to pilot Robert G. Buley.``For the most part, the results turned out to be more thanacceptable to the crews that will have to use the system day today,'' Buley said in a report for a trade publication.   Congress has required installation of TCASII in all U.S.airliners built to carry more than 30 passengers by the end of 1991.   Rep. Ron Packard, R-Calif., introduced a bill last week to phasein the installation starting with 25 percent of each airline'sfleet by the end of 1990, 50 percent a year later and the rest bythe end of 1993. It would order the Federal Aviation Administrationto analyze operation of the system in the first year in case anychanges are needed.   But airline industry officials say they need at least until theend of 1994 to install the systems in 4,500 domestic airliners.More than 1,200 foreign airliners that fly U.S. skies also would berequired to have the anti-collision device.   ``The timetable's too tight,'' said Tim Neale, spokesman for theAir Transport Association, which represents the airline industry.``We've got so much going on that the airlines don't feel they canget all the planes done in that time without tremendous disruptionsin service.''   He noted pending requirements to replace parts on agingairliners, a law that orders installation of equipment to warnagainst strong wind changes around airports, increases in airtravel and a limited number of airline mechanics to do the work.   ``We think you need to crawl before you can run,'' Neale said,adding that no test of the system has determined what will happenwhen large numbers of airliners, all with the units filling theircockpits with a chorus of traffic advisories, are flying in thesame area. ``You might get a domino effect,'' he said.   Neale said the airlines support the idea of phasing in thesystems and having a one-year test period. But he said they wouldoppose the bill, which is to be the subject of a congressionalhearing on Thursday, if it requires full installation by the end of1993.   Carriers have begun placing orders for the anti-collision systemwith three manufacturers competing in a potentially $700 millionmarket: Allied-Signal Aerospace Co.'s Bendix-King Air TransportAvionics Division, the Air Transport Systems Division of HoneywellInc., and the Collins divisions of Rockwell International.   New orders are expected to be announced within the next fewdays, according to industry sources.   The TCASII system consists of a sophisticated transponder thathas already been installed on some aircraft, antennae, and acomputer that analyzes and displays the movement of nearby planes.The transponder sends out a signal to other aircraft as well asground controllers.   ``The system has no bugs,'' said Don Dodgen of Honeywell.   If two computers meet, he said, orders to the pilots will bereconciled automatically: if one plane is told to climb, the otherwill be advised to descend or stay on course.   While industry experts believe TCASII with its ``climb'' and``descend'' commands offers enough to prevent nearly all midaircollisions, an even more complex system has been developed,TCASIII, that also will include horizontal capabilities.   Dodgen said that even though Honeywell is testing such a systemon an FAA airliner, it is not likely to be approved forinstallation on commercial planes for several years, and then onlyon models off the assembly line, since it would require majormodification for older airliners.</TEXT></DOC>
