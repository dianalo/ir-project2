The president has made several strides to demonstrate hiscommitment to a government that is more compassionate to those inneed, and more attuned to such issues as the environment, minorityconcerns and women.   He often describes that aspect of his administration by revivinga phrase he used in the campaign when he pledged to make a``kinder-gentler'' nation.   In that vein, Bush last week submitted to Capitol Hill hislegislative proposal for child care _ a plan that would give a taxcredit or refund of up to $1,000 per child to low-income people.   He also proposed a 29 percent increase in spending for thehomeless, to $645 million next year. He recently spoke about how hewas disturbed by the sight of homeless people huddled on the groundsnear the White House.   And Bush tempered his opposition to federal gun control andbucked the displeasure of his fellow National Rifle Associationmembers by halting the imports of semiautomatic assault guns untiltheir usage can be reviewed.   These and other actions give Bush a boost simply by comparisonwith his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, whose record was considereddistinctly not kinder or gentler by such groups as women, minoritiesand environmentalists.   But these groups are reserving judgment. Some are waiting formore dramatic leadership, and others, including theenvironmentalists are waiting to see the fine print that goes withhis positive sounding rhetoric on such issues as acid rain.   ``He deserves an A for a new tone,'' said the Rev. Jesse Jackson,the two-time democratic presidential candidate who has developed afriendly relationship with Bush and who has visited with thepresident at the White House.   He said the access Bush has given to people who felt locked outof the Reagan White House has been ``very positive.''   Bush has set ``the right tone but not enough boldness in a rightdirection,'' Jackson contended. ``Now the question comes to a testof leadership. It must be bold, it must take a direction that willremedy fundamental problems.''   Heather Booth, president of the liberal lobbying organizationCitizen Action, said Bush's ``rhetoric is wonderful'' and that someof his actions have been what she called a welcome break from theReagan years.   ``I am giving him credit for understanding there's a newprogressive opening,'' in the country, she said, but added, ``Ihaven't seen a substantive set of proposals that are convincing inbeing able to rise to the challenges.''   Some complain that Bush, or those around him, often as not haveundermined some of the very kinder-gentler signals he has sent.   Some examples:   _Bush cheered environmentalists when he indefinitely postponedoffshore oil leasing key environmental tracts off California andFlorida. But environmentalists were dismayed that he failed one oftheir highest priority litmus tests when his Interior SecretaryManuel Lujan announced the administration will allow oil explorationin the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge.   _Bush called for banning of ozone-depleting chloroflourocarbonsby the end of this century, but that was a position that was alreadyadvocated by many other nations, and the United States was seen as``playing catchup,'' said Tom Stoel, senior attorney for the NaturalResources Defense Council.   ``It wasn't so much that Bush was anti-environmental as that hedidn't have his act together,'' he said. ``He indicated he was goingto be an environmental leader and so far there's been very littleenvironmental leadership shown.''   _Bush proposed an increase in the minimum wage to $4.25, butcoupled it with a lower so-called training wage for first-timeworkers. And he angered labor activists by refusing to intervene inthe Eastern Airlines strike.   _Bush cast a well-publicized and wide net to draw more women intohis administration. He named two women to his Cabinet, LaborSecretary Elizabeth Dole and U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.But he has disappointed feminists by lunching at a private all-maleclub and joining in the merriment at the annual men-only AlfalfaClub dinner.   _Bush made a strong pitch throughout the pre-inaugural period andin the first two weeks of his presidency for the highest ethicalstandards in the people he appointed to his administration. Thatmessage was somewhat diluted when Secretary of State James Baker IIIand White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray both voluntarily disentangledthemselves from financial affairs that became the subject of newsstories. Neither was engaged in illegality, but said they did notwant to permit any appearance of impropriety.   Administration spokesman insist the kinder-gentler concept is noton the back burner even though it often is overshadowed byday-to-day events.   ``We look for opportunities for getting out any of the messageshe's trying to get across,'' said White House communicationsDirector David Demarest. ``We'll see more kinder-gentler. We'll seemore of the entirety of the program.''   For her part, first lady Barbara Bush has had no trouble making akinder-gentler image a big part of her White House life.   Her first public event outside the White House was a visit to adaycare center for homeless children. In addition to her longtimepromotion of literacy efforts, she has visited soup kitchens,nursing homes, and a schoolchildren's celebration of black historymonth.   Mrs. Bush also has set up a foundation to raise money forliteracy programs.</TEXT></DOC>
