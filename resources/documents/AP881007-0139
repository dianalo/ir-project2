Employers added 255,000 new jobs to their payrolls last month,sending the number of unemployed workers down by a like figure to6,596,000, the Labor Department said. The unemployment total wasthe lowest it has been since June, when the jobless rate hit a14-year-low 5.3 percent.   But more than 100,000 of the new jobs were an unusually highnumber of teachers returning to the classroom. Payroll growth inthe private sector has averaged only 120,000 new jobs in each ofthe past two months, compared with average monthly gains of 300,000in the first half of 1988.   The 0.2 percentage point drop in the September jobless ratedirectly offset an increase of the same size, to 5.6 percent, inAugust.   Analysts said the figures indicate a continuing trend of slowereconomic growth _ just what financial markets nervous about anoverheating economy and inflation wanted _ going into next month'spresidential election.   ``If you were (Republican nominee) George Bush, I don't thinkyou could have written a better set of numbers,'' said David Wyss,chief financial economist for Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,Mass.   Wyss called the loss of 18,000 factory jobs last month followinga similar drop of 19,000 in August a concern but added: ``If you'rea Republican, you avoid the details and look at the big picture.''   That's just what President Reagan did, citing the figures in acampaign rally for Bush in Michigan as evidence that ``America'seconomy is a Grand Prix racer.''   However, there was other evidence in Friday's report that thejob picture is not as rosey as it appears at first glance.   Construction employment was flat and oil and gas industryrosters fell for the second month in a row. Together withassembly-line employment growth, they had been providing an average65,000 new jobs a month from January through July.   Employment growth in business services such as data processingthat has provided a large chunk of the job gains in the 6-year-longeconomic recovery also has slowed to a trickle the past two months,the government said.   Janet L. Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics, told thecongressional Joint Economic Committee that as many industries lostjobs last month as gained them, the first time that has occurred inmore than two years.   Citing an unusual monthly drop of 107,000 people in the laborforce, Larry Mishel, an economist of the Economic Policy Institute,a liberal think tank financed largely by labor unions, said Reaganand Bush ``are getting lucky on the demographics.''   ``The whole reason why Reagan has been able to achieve lowunemployment rates is that the population growth slowed by a thirdin the 1980s,'' Mishel said. ``President Carter had the Baby Boomcoming into the labor market and had to create a lot more jobs.Reagan has enjoyed the effects of the Baby Bust.''   Economists said they did not expect government economic reportsdue to be released before the Nov. 8 election to help Democraticpresidential nominee Michael Dukakis.   Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of the WEFA Group, a consultingfirm based in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., predicted that the employment,inflation and trade figures all will paint a rosy economy.   ``He's not going to get any help from the raw employmentfigures,'' Chimerine said of Dukakis. ``If he's going to win oneconomics, it's going to have to come from convincing peoplethere's a problem ahead of us.''   Bush repeatedly has focused on the creation of some 15 millionnew jobs under the Reagan administration since the end of the1981-82 recession, which had sent the jobless rate into doubledigits.   Dukakis has countered that the issue is not the number of newjobs being created, but the quality of those jobs. He hasemphasized that hourly wages after adjustments for inflation havefallen since Reagan assumed office in 1981.   August figures on inflation and average wages bolstered thatargument. The Labor Department reported that real hourly earningsin terms of purchasing power dropped 1.3 percent during the month,the worst decline since the government began collecting suchfigures in 1964.   The department said average hourly wages rose one-halfpercentage point, or five cents, in September to $9.37 afterremaining flat in July and August.   Over the past year, nominal hourly wages have risen at an annualrate of 3.3 percent, compared with an inflation rate of 4 percentas measured by consumer prices.</TEXT></DOC>
