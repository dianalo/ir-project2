Japan's 90.3 million eligible voters began casting ballots at 7a.m. to fill half the seats in the 252-member upper house ofParliament, known as the House of Councillors.   Results in many districts were expected by 2 a.m. Monday (1 p.m.Sunday EDT), but counting in Tokyo and some other large districtswill not begin until Monday, with final results expected by evening.   On Saturday, Prime Minister Sousuke Uno attacked the rivalSocialist Party in a final campaign speech, while the Socialistleader urged voters to ``make clear your disgust'' with Uno'sscandal-plagued government.   A poor showing by Uno's conservative Liberal Democrats couldincrease pressure on Uno, in office less than two months, to resignand lead to early elections for the more powerful lower house ofParliament.   A Liberal Democratic loss there could bring Japan aSocialist-led government, since the lower house elects the primeminister.   ``Socialism does not fit in Japan. Please help us defend freedomin this country,'' Uno, 66, told several hundred workers of hisLiberal Democratic Party. He praised his party's record in raisingJapan's status in the world.   Personally hobbled by allegations he kept paid mistresses, Unomade few public appearances during the 18-day campaign and his lastwas in a secluded parking lot at party headquarters.   By contrast, Takako Doi, chairwoman of the Japan SocialistParty, held her final campaign rally at a main intersection.   ``Now is the time we can change politics, and the energy isbeginning to move,'' Ms. Doi said, assailing scandals and a newsales tax. ``Tomorrow is your big chance to make clear yourdisgust.''   Polls, analysts and even many Liberal Democrats cast thegoverning party as an underdog in the voting for 126 of the 252seats in the House of Councilors. Recent polls by three majornational newspapers indicated the party would win only 30 to 42seats, far short of the 54 it needs to maintain a simple majority.   Final results are expected Monday evening.   An upper house majority remains beyond the labor-backedSocialists' reach, as they would need to win 84 seats and arerunning only 54 candidates, with expectations of about 40 winners.That would boost their overall total in the house from the current43 to about 60.   Thus they have led efforts to create an opposition coalitionwith three other parties _ the No. 2 opposition Komeito (CleanGovernment Party), the Democratic Socialists and the SocialistDemocratic Federation, which now has no seats in the upper chamber.   A defeat would be a historic setback for the party that hasproduced all of Japan's prime ministers and held majorities in bothhouses since it was formed in 1955.   Without control of the upper house, the Liberal Democrats wouldfind it awkward though not impossible to pass legislation.   The popularity of the governing party began to erode last summerwith the first disclosures in a scandal that led to theresignations of three Cabinet ministers and, ultimately, PrimeMinister Noboru Takeshita.   The Recruit Co., a publishing conglomerate, was accused ofselling millions of dollars in underpriced stocks and makingpolitical donations to obtain favors from politicians. With much ofits elite tainted by Recruit, the Liberal Democrats were unable toselect a new prime minister for more than one month.   Shortly after Uno took office June 2, reports began to appearthat he had kept paid mistresses, igniting criticism from women'sgroups. Uno has said he did nothing immoral.   Meanwhile, the opposition rallied anti-government sentimentagainst a 3 percent sales tax that took effect April 1, claiming itcreated an unfair burden on lower-income households.   The Liberal Democrats pushed a tax reform package, including thenew levy, through Parliament late last year over an oppositionboycott. In a nation where consensus is highly valued, the partywas criticized for ignoring opposition views.   The opposition put forward a record number of women candidatesto win the votes of women who encountered the new tax in theirdaily shopping.   Farmers, an important source of Liberal Democratic support, alsorevolted against government moves, made under strong pressure fromthe United States, to open Japan's market wider to agriculturalproducts.   A record 40 parties and 670 candidates are running Sunday.Voters will elect 76 legislators in districts and another 50nationwide. In the nationwide voting, voters write in the name ofthe party they support, and the 50 seats are apportioned on thebasis of each party's percentage of the total vote.   Though the Socialists are headed by a popular chairwoman, theyhave been widely accused of lacking a realistic and unifiedplatform, partly because of a small but powerful radical left wing.   In the past they have called for Japan to disband itsSelf-Defense Forces and scrap the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, underwhich about 64,000 American troops are stationed in Japan.   Socialist leaders, when pressed, say they would not immediatelydo away with the armed forces and seek only to revise the treaty.But Ms. Doi and others have said on several occasions that allAmerican warships entering Japanese ports should be carefullyinspected and denied entry if nuclear arms are found aboard.</TEXT></DOC>
