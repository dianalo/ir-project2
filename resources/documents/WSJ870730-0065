But it is. So yesterday the ice cream maker said it formally licensed the name from Jerry Garcia, guitarist for the Grateful Dead rock band.    Ben andamp; Jerry's agreed to pay royalties, half to Mr. Garcia and half to the Rex Foundation, a charity that the Grateful Dead supports.    Cherries Garcia is vanilla ice cream studded with bing cherries and chocolate flakes. Ben andamp; Jerry's credits Jane Williamson, a Portland, Maine, fan of both the band and the ice cream company, with suggesting the name. She got a year's supply of ice cream. </TEXT></DOC>
