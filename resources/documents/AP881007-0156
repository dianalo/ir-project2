(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim and Tammy Bakker are moving theirministry into new leased quarters on a millionaire's estate, acrossthe state line from their former PTL complex, but say they'llcontinue trying to regain control of PTL.   Volunteers on Friday moved furniture into the new headquartersof Jim and Tammy Ministries, a brick colonial house on a 300-acreestate owned by Amway tycoon Dexter Yager.   ``As you can see, we're not set up for company just yet,''Bakker's secretary, Sue Hartman, said in the front hall momentsafter Bakker, clad in a blue sweat suit, ducked into a back room.   On Monday, Jim and Tammy Ministries began moving from theirstorefront office near PTL's Christian theme park, Heritage USA, inFort Mill, S.C.   The Bakkers had set up shop at a Fort Mill shopping plaza, buttheir space was leased to someone else, said Bakker spokesman HalSweigart.   Bakker had made a bid to buy back PTL last month for $172million, but the deal fell through when he could not prove he hadthe financial backing.   Earlier this week, PTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Bentonannounced he had accepted a $115 million offer for PTL's assetsfrom Toronto businessman Stephen Mernick.   However, Bakker has not given up trying to regain control of theministry he built, aides said.   ``We consider the new office an interim step on the way back toHeritage USA,'' said Lin Robertson, a volunteer at Jim and TammyMinistries.   Bakker resigned from PTL in 1987 after admitting a sexualencounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn seven years earlier ina Florida motel room.</TEXT></DOC>
