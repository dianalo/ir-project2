The resolution level of {sup 1}H n.m.r. spectra achieved so farat a resonance frequency of 270 MHz permits determination of essentialfunctional groups. The coalification series ranging from soft brown coalto anthracite shows an increase of the aromaticity values f/sub a//supC/ and also an increase of the f{alpha}/sup H/ values, which is analogousto the increases in reflectance and carbon content. There are markeddifferences between the functional groups to be found in detrital andxylite-containing soft brown coals. Tertiary (Miocene) brown coals fromthe 2nd Lower Lusatian seam (GDR) (i.e. unbedded, poorly bedded, bedded,xylite-containing unbedded, and gelified bedded coals) differ significantlydue to variations in micropetrographical composition. Varying amountsof cellulose and lignin are contained in the xylites of the 2nd LowerLusatian seam. {sup 13}C and {sup 1}H n.m.r. measurements are employedto determine the main constituents of substances such as pyropissite,retinite, fusite and 'monkey hairs' (fossilized rubber). 48 refs., 5figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
