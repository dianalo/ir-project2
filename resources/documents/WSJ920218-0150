Economists, it must be noted, have been optimistic aboutprofits since last summer, but the optimism has turned out tobe ill-founded. In the fourth quarter of last year, netincome of 615 major corporations slumped 34% from a yearearlier, a Wall Street Journal survey shows. Although part ofthe decline resulted from write-offs related to corporatelayoffs and other restructuring moves, it still was clearthat profits remained depressed.</LP><TEXT>   After-tax earnings from continuing operations fell 35% inthe fourth quarter. In the third quarter, net income fell 23%from a year earlier.   One reason analysts are reasonably optimistic about thisquarter is that it will be compared with the recession-hitfirst quarter of 1991, when net fell 16%. Further, lastyear's second and third quarters were very weak, and ifeconomists are right, year-toyear comparisons also should behelped by an economic recovery.   The 50 economists interviewed monthly by Blue ChipEconomic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, now expectinflation-adjusted gross domestic product to edge upward by0.5% in the current quarter, a narrow improvement over the0.3% rise in 1991's fourth quarter. But they expect a 2.2%rise in the second quarter and a 3.2% upturn in the secondhalf. If those gains are realized, they should be reflectedin higher profits.   &quot;It remains my position that we are in the midst of arecovery that is so slow it doesn't feel like much ishappening,&quot; says Greg A. Smith of investment firm PrudentialSecurities Inc. In that sort of recovery, he adds, it isdifficult for many companies to generate volume and setprices that will lead to higher profits. But he does expectthe economy -- and profits -- to steadily improve.   Profits and the economy obviously work together. John E.Silvia, first vice president and chief economist of KemperFinancial Services, says he thinks &quot;gradual improvement incorporate profits will help businesses restructure theirbalance sheets as well as prompt employment gains and capitalspending.&quot;   Edward Yardeni of the investment firm C.J. Lawrence sayslower interest rates already are helping corporate treasurersrefinance their bond obligations at lower costs. This factoralone, he says, could increase corporate after-tax profitsthis year by 10% from last year's levels.   Among major groups, auto companies, steel producers andchemical concerns were hit hard in the fourth quarter. Netincome for securities firms and the aerospace industrysoared.   Heavy combined fourth-quarter losses at Detroit's BigThree almost certainly made 1991 the worst year in thehistory of U.S. auto making.   Even without the huge amount of red ink expected fromGeneral Motors, the numbers looked bad. Ford ended 1991 witha fourth-quarter loss of $475.7 million. Chrysler'sfourth-quarter earnings of $97 million reflected a one-timegain of $127 million from selling its half of a joint-ventureU.S. assembly plant to former partner Mitsubishi Motors.   GM hasn't reported its results yet because it has beenselling new preference stock. The big auto maker is expectedto report next week, and analysts are estimating the companyhad operating losses of as much as $750 million in the fourthquarter and about $3 billion for the year.   And while hope remains for a turnaround in 1992, thecompanies don't foresee much immediate relief. Chrysler saidit expects a bigger pretax loss in the current quarter thanthe $74 million it lost before taxes in the 1991 fourthquarter. David N. McCammon, Ford's vice president of finance,declined to predict how quickly Ford would return to theblack.   The fourth quarter was the worst in years for the steelindustry, as virtually all large U.S. mills reported heavylosses. The results were aggravated by major charges, mostlyfor restructuring. Bethlehem Steel took a charge of $575million, Armco set aside $203.1 million, Inland SteelIndustries, $165.1 million, and USX's U.S. Steel Group, $129million.   Steelmakers continued to suffer from oversupply, priceweakness and lower shipments to auto makers and other majorcustomers. Only Allegheny Ludlum, which makes the moreprofitable specialty steels and benefits from exports, andWorthington Industries, which is more a steel processor thana producer, managed to stay in the black. The first quartermay be slightly improved, though Bethlehem Steel has alreadyforecast another loss and Inland termed it &quot;improbable&quot; thatthe company would make money in 1992.   Earnings fell sharply in the fourth quarter for manychemical companies. Analysts said that while the worst may beover in terms of earnings declines, they don't expect asustained rebound for the industry until the second half ofthis year.   Some big one-time restructuring and write-down chargeswere added to the two main factors that have been a drag onearnings for the past several quarters -- an industryoversupply of many basic chemicals and the recession. DuPont, the nation's biggest chemical company, took the biggestcharge: $712 million. Restructuring and cost-reductionaccounted for $537 million of the after-tax charge, with $175million covering the cost of recalling Benlate fungicide,which was pulled from the market earlier in the year. DowChemical took a $370 million pretax charge to cover plantclosings and asset write-downs. Monsanto, however, reportedsharply higher results, mainly from lower natural gas andother raw material costs.   Meanwhile, Wall Street brokerage firms posted huge profitjumps, capping a blockbuster year for the securities industryin the face of the nation's recession.   The results contrast with the weak year-earlier period,which was one of Wall Street's worst quarters. But in 1991,the brokerage firms cashed in on corporate America's recordissuance of new stocks and bonds and the stock market's rallythat began in mid-November. Falling interest rates fueledboth trends-and lowered the firms' interest expenses, one ofthe Street's biggest cost items.   A stark exception: Salomon, whose Salomon Brotherssecurities unit felt the lingering effects of theTreasury-auction bidding scandal that surfaced in August. Thesecurities unit had pretax profit of just $27 million-tinycompared with competitors. The parent firm's overall loss wascaused by a charge at its Phibro Energy unit relating tofalling oil prices.   Other brokerage firms faced no such problems. PaineWebberGroup's record results reversed a year-earlier loss caused bytroubled &quot;bridge&quot; loans to corporate clients and the costs oflayoffs.   But Wall Street's profit rebound won't necessarily last,especially if interest rates turn upward and underwritingactivity ebbs.   Results continued to soar in the aerospace and defenseindustry because of booming deliveries of airliners and theeffective way most defense contractors are coping withfederal budget cuts.   Both the commercial and military business sidescontributed to McDonnell Douglas's strong earnings, whichincluded $72 million in profit from discontinued operationsand a $32 million gain from settlement of some InternalRevenue Service issues. General Dynamics -- working toeliminate its nondefense operations rather than blending themas many other companies are -- recorded a $100 million gainfrom discontinued operations relating to its sale of Cessna.The year-earlier loss at General Dynamics reflectedwrite-offs on various programs and restructuring actions.Martin Marietta's earnings fell only because of areorganization of its aluminum operations, which resulted ina $39 million charge.   Analysts expect aerospace and defense earnings to keeprising in the current quarter and through all of 1992, atleast.   Here are the fourth-quarter profits for various industrygroups and comparisons with the year-earlier quarter.

Aluminum producers fared poorly in the quarter. Theindustry was hurt by a continuing aluminum glut on worldmarkets, and most producers were forced to ship a lessprofitable mix. Aluminum Co. of America recorded a charge of$217 million for restructuring and environmental cleanup.Reynolds Metals' results improved because the year-earlierquarter included a charge of $93.9 million.   Most mining companies had lower operating income becauseof declines in metals and minerals prices and higheroperating costs. Magma's loss largely reflected a $140.9million write-down on a mining property, and Brush Wellmanwrote down $30.7 million of its assets. Asarco's net soaredbecause the year-earlier quarter included a charge of $51.4million. Cleveland-Cliffs' operating income rose from theyear-earlier results, which were affected by a strike. Butnet fell because the 1990 period included a $47.1 millionspecial gain.   While most mining companies said production costsincreased, Newmont Mining said its 90.1%-owned gold company'scash production costs fell to $198 an ounce for the quarterfrom $235 a year earlier. The decline came from acost-reduction effort that included a bonus program linked toproductivity.   Wood-products concerns continued to reel from weak pulpand paper prices and depressed lumber demand, although a mildupturn in construction helped some companies post profitimprovements.   Boise Cascade's loss would have been worse without anextraordinary gain of $52.8 million, which included assetsales and restructuring charges. Weyerhaeuser's loss included$238 million of restructuring charges. Louisiana Pacific'simprovement reflected a spurt in demand for the company'sbuilding products, as did Potlatch's. The industry as a wholewill continue to suffer as long as the economy remainsanemic; most companies don't expect significant profitimprovements until the second half of 1992.

The price of oil has fallen by around $10 a barrelsince the fourth quarter of 1990, and that decline sharplyreduced exploration and production profits.   Gasoline refining and marketing remain hard-hit at mostcompanies because of the recession, which has curbed demand.Gasoline price wars in many parts of the country narrowedprofit margins. The sluggish economy combined with someoversupply also curtailed demand for petrochemicals, whichremained in a slump. Chevron took a $244 million chargerelated mostly to a companywide work-force reduction and theprobable cutback at its giant Port Arthur, Texas, refinery;earnings a year earlier were reduced by special chargestotaling $123 million.   Analysts don't see any drastic changes for the oilindustry this quarter. However, year-to-year comparisonswon't be as stark because the average crude price in the 1991first quarter had already fallen.   Drillers and oilfield equipment and services companies sawsharply reduced profits, as drilling for oil and natural gasplunged to record lows in the U.S. Overseas activity,however, was relatively stable, and companies that were ableto do more foreign business could offset the domesticdownturn somewhat. Halliburton took an $83 million charge,mostly related to a restructuring and shrinking of itsdomestic oilfield operations. Schlumberger was buoyed by again of $131 million from the sale of an investment.   Profits for natural gas pipeline companies were mixed.Many of the companies benefited from cost-cutting strategiesthat offset the continuing slump in gas prices during thecritical winter season.   Panhandle Eastern swung to a profit from a year-earlierloss, partly due to widespread cost reductions and a rateincrease at its Texas Eastern Transmission unit. Theyear-earlier results included provisions of about $280million. Enron's margins were boosted by its cogenerationpower plant-building segment and by long-term contracts tosell gas to utilities. Transco Energy's wider loss included arestructuring charge of $149.2 million.   Industry analysts predict only modest earnings improvementthis year because market growth remains slow.   ---   OIL                                                                                                          -- INTEGRATED OILS                                4th Qtr.     4th Qtr.    % 10 Firms                         1991         1990     Chg                                                                                                        Amoco Corp                     153,000      538,000  -  72 Atlantic Richfield             268,000      566,000  -  53 Chevron Corp                    39,000      633,000  -  94 Exxon Corp                   1,120,000    1,555,000  -  28 Mobil Corp                     401,000      652,000  -  38 Phillips Petroleum              79,000      237,000  -  67 Sun Co                         -35,000       18,000    ...

The rail group's big net loss reflected special chargesfor work-force reductions, but railroad earnings before thecharges increased. Excluding a $497.7 million after-taxcharge, Norfolk Southern would have had a 22% earningsimprovement. Earnings at CSX would have increased 4% withoutan after-tax charge of $490 million for productivityimprovements. However, Conrail's earnings excluding a $447million after-tax charge would have declined to $71 millionfrom $76 million. Efficiency gains, including reduction inthe size of freight train crews, helped offset flat or downrail traffic and positioned the group for a first-quarterearnings improvement.   Trucking company earnings were hurt by flat freightvolumes and continued rate discounting in theless-than-truckload sector. But Consolidated Freightways'loss from its Emery Worldwide unit narrowed. Analysts expecthealthier profits for the group in the first quarter.   Air-express companies had trouble improving on 1990'sdepressed results, as volume growth slowed and price-cuttingwiped out productivity gains. Kevin Murphy, an analyst withMorgan Stanley, sees no real turnaround for the industry inthis quarter.   Sales of medium and heavy-duty trucks continued atrecessionary levels, with no signs of a significant upturn.Paccar benefited from the absence of restructuring chargesand lower provisions for loan losses. Cost-cutting, plusstrong sales of mid-range engines, enabled Cummins toapproach the break-even level. Unless conditions in itsmarkets get worse, the engine maker expects a first-quarterprofit. But Navistar, the maker of International brandtrucks, expects to report another loss for its fiscal firstquarter.   The economic slowdown continued to hammer machinerymakers, and they expect any recovery this year to be slow.Caterpillar's loss included pretax charges of $324 millionfor a &quot;probable&quot; plant closing in York, Pa., andconsolidation of Brazilian operations, among other things.Deere's loss included an after-tax charge of $120 million tocut 2,100 jobs and close a foundry. That was partly offset bya credit of $65 million related to accounting for inventory.Lower interest rates should eventually help boost sales forconstruction-equipment makers.   ---   TRANSPORTATION                                                                                                          -- RAILROADS                                                                                                                                       4th Qtr.     4th Qtr.    % 6 Firms                          1991         1990     Chg                                                                                                        Burlington North                40,000       44,000  -   9 Consolidated Rail             -376,000       76,000    ...

Analysts attributed Standard Pacific'sdrop in net income to a special $3 million charge. Analystsproject solid year-to-year gains in the current quarter forStandard Pacific, Centex, Kaufman andamp; Broad, PHM and ClaytonHomes.   Weak Christmas sales and heavy markdowns are expected todepress earnings for many retailers in the fiscal fourthquarter. Although sales in January, the period's final month,strengthened substantially, analysts say it's too soon todeclare an end to the recession.   Some chains, however, may get a boost from adjustinginventories for inflation and from lower interest rates.Sears Roebuck, which owns financial-service businesses inaddition to its core retail units and operates on acalendar-year basis, already reported a 35% jump in profitfrom year-earlier depressed earnings.   Analysts expect Dayton Hudson and Nordstrom, which bothoperate large numbers of stores in the weak Californiamarket, to post lower earnings. Woolworth is also expected topost a decline, even before a $250 million charge forclosing, selling or changing the format of 900 stores.   Hotel and casino companies turned in mixed results,largely because of the recession. Lodging companies generallyreported flat to weaker operating results masked by unusualitems. Marriott's operating profit dropped 2%, while HiltonHotels' lodging chain produced essentially flat operatingresults coupled with a 45% drop in casino operating income.   The restaurant industry showed signs of improvement at theend of a sluggish year. Domestic same-store sales grew about4% at McDonald's as the chain benefited from increasedtraffic at year end, favorable weather and continued pricediscounting. Overseas, McDonald's continued to postdouble-digit profit gains. TCBY Enterprises saw a 5% declinein same-store sales, but that's a big improvement from a yearearlier.   Recreational products companies posted mixed results.Eastman Kodak's loss included a $597 million restructuringcharge. But even without the charge, earnings would have beenwell below analysts' expectations. Paramount Communications'decline reflected weak movie-business results and costsassociated with the renovation of Madison Square Garden. WaltDisney's fiscal first-quarter profit, on the other hand,jumped mainly because of success in the company's movieoperations.   In the media sector, Capital Cities/ABC suffered from acontinued advertising slump in broadcast advertising and froma charge for the redemption of high-yield debt. However,profit at Capital Cities publishing increased substantiallybecause of gains at its nine daily newspapers.   At major newspaper companies, results again were hurt bythe slumping market for retail and classified advertising invirtually every region of the country. Several publishers,such as Times Mirror, used the quarter to take large one-timecharges for voluntary severance and early retirement plans.Analysts say year-to-year comparisons on major advertisingareas could flatten out, but events such as R.H. Macy'srecent bankruptcy-court filing are expected to extendadvertising problems for publishers such as New York Times,Times Mirror and Washington Post.   Airline profits were weighed down by the continuingeffects of sluggish traffic, discount ticket pricing and theweak economy. Results weren't as bad as in the 1990 quarter,when the industry was affected by the Persian Gulf conflict,high jet fuel prices and a steep drop in tourism. But theimprovement was beaten back. Although December jet fuelprices dropped about 27% from the year before, Decembertraffic growth was only 3.6%. UAL took pretax charges of $130million for the quarter.   In the apparel industry, athletic shoe companies andmakers of inexpensive casual clothing posted the strongestgains, reflecting a cautious and highly promotional retailenvironment. Hartmarx was stymied by the weak sales in men'ssuits and in its own retail stores. As consumers continue tospend cautiously in the near term, analysts believe the firstquarter for most apparel concerns will be largely unchanged.   ---   AUTOS                                                                                                          -- MANUFACTURING                                                                                                                                       4th Qtr.     4th Qtr.    % 2 Firms                          1991         1990     Chg                                                                                                        Chrysler                        97,000       31,000  + 213 Ford Motor                    -475,700     -518,500    ...

Campbell Soup's North American unit had higher salesvolume on soups and noodles. Better packaged-food sales andcitrus-operation yields more than offset lower banana profitsat Dole Foods. U.S. chocolate operations sweetened HersheyFood's bottom line as acquisitions led to a 13% quarterlysales gain. Higher volumes and margins boosted earnings atQuaker Oats. And margins improved at Pet, which reportedstrong sales gains for Mexican foods and Italian soups.   However, earnings soured at Borden, which took a $44million restructuring charge in the quarter and was pinchedby higher milk costs and lower cheese prices.   Food retailers muddled through another poor quarter. Asthe recession lingered and shoppers tightened already cinchedbelts, grocery stores found that they could no longer evenpass through price increases to make up for customers'shrinking appetites. Food-price inflation was practicallynonexistent. Sales of cheaper private-label items continuedto flourish, as supermarket shoppers reached for genericgoods on the grocery shelves. Super Valu Stores was helped bya $51.3 million nonrecurring gain.   The major beverage companies reported mostly moderateearnings gains amid the recession, capping a difficult yearfor soft drinks and beer. In the quarter, Coca-Cola sawvolume, as measured by case sales, rise 3%, while PepsiCo'swas flat. Coke benefited from stronger overseas sales,particularly in newly unified Germany, while Pepsi's earningsgot a boost from the performance of its world-wide soft drinkand restaurant divisions. Pepsi's struggling Kentucky FriedChicken domestic unit, however, hampered earnings.   Anheuser-Busch increased its market share during 1991. The63% earnings swings at Aandamp;W Brands and Whitman partly reflectyear-earlier special items.   For the first quarter, Kidder Peabody analyst Roy Burrysees earnings increases of about 20% for Coke and 13% forboth Pepsi and Anheuser-Busch.   ---   FOOD AND DRINK                                                                                                          -- FOOD                                                                                                                                       4th Qtr.     4th Qtr.    % 21 Firms                         1991         1990     Chg                                                                                                        Archer-Daniels-Mid             131,054      117,439  +  12 Borden Inc                      43,100      102,300  -  58 Campbell Soup                  160,600      135,300  +  19 ConAgra Inc                    111,700       95,200  +  17 CPC International              110,136      101,450  +   9 Dean Foods                      15,893       16,810  -   5 Dole Food Co                    29,063       19,417  +  50 Flowers Indust                   5,449        4,731  +  15 General Mills Inc              128,300      118,200  +   9 Gerber Products                 14,521       27,208  -  47 Heinz (H J)                    122,821      139,770  -  12 Hershey Foods                   74,904       46,391  +  61 Hormel (George A)               36,601       36,316  +   1 Kellogg Co                     118,200      108,500  +   9 McCormick andamp; Co                  29,996       25,498  +  18 Pet Inc                         41,600       34,600  +  20 Quaker Oats Co                  44,700        3,100  +1342 Ralston Purina                 130,700      135,300  -   3 Sara Lee Corp                  189,400      166,800  +  14 Tyson Foods Inc                 31,874       28,875  +  10 Wrigley (Wm) Jr                 23,095       20,158  +  15 TOTAL                        1,593,707    1,483,363  +   7                                                                                                          -- FOOD RETAILERS                                                                                                                                       4th Qtr.     4th Qtr.    % 10 Firms                         1991         1990     Chg                                                                                                        Albertson's Inc                 59,519       55,817  +   7 American Stores                 28,931       30,906  -   6 Bruno's Inc                     17,897       18,535  -   3 Fleming Cos                    -21,648       26,706    ...

Still, even without the charge,earnings would have dropped nearly 50%, as IBM brought to aclose the most difficult year in its history.   Results for other computer makers were mixed.Hewlett-Packard would have produced a 12% earnings increaseif not for a charge of $150 million before taxes to cover3,300 job reductions. Sun Microsystems produced another solidquarter as it continued to lead the workstation market. AppleComputer also did well as it began to get its costs undercontrol and found strong demand for its new notebookcomputers. Even long-troubled Unisys produced a profit, onthe strength of major cost-cutting.   The outlook for the first quarter is weak. NewIBM-compatible mainframes, available since the fall, may helpIBM and Amdahl, but the recession appears to be keeping a lidon demand. Pressure on prices will hurt workstationcompanies, even though that's one of the pockets of strongrevenue growth. And personal computer companies seem unableto halt the price wars that hurt the industry last year.   The semiconductor and software industries saw stronggrowth. Semiconductor companies were boosted by brisk salesof new products or were aided by the effects of costreductions. Not all companies were carried by a wave ofprofitability related to chips; Avnet's semiconductor salesheld steady, but sales of its other electronic componentsfell, hurting net income.   Among communications companies, American Telephone andamp;Telegraph was disappointing in the quarter, suffering from a7% decline in sales of telecommunications products andsystems. That offset long-distance increases of 6% in revenueand 6.5% in traffic volume, although traffic volume was downslightly from the prior quarter. Results included a $218million write-down of the company's stake in Italy'sIndustriali Riunite.   Motorola was helped by improvement in its Asian markets,despite declines in the U.S. and Europe attributable tosluggish economic conditions. Overall, the improved earningsreflected the strength of Motorola's product lines, andanalysts said that should provide for good 1992 results.   ---   DATA PROCESSING                                                                                                          -- COMPUTERS/INFORMATION                                                                                                                                       4th Qtr.     4th Qtr.    % 14 Firms                         1991         1990     Chg                                                                                                        Amdahl Corp                    -12,677       61,314    ...

Also aiding the bottom line werereduced expenses and a slowdown in loan problems.   But several West Coast banks continued to suffer fromproblem loans stemming from a souring real estate market.Security Pacific posted a sharply higher loan-loss provisionof $731 million as it prepared for its merger withBankAmerica, and Wells Fargo set aside a similar amount forpossible loan losses.   Still, most banks enjoyed the fruits of lower interestrates, which helped to widen their profit margins, anddecreased operating costs resulting from expense-reductionefforts. And a slowdown in problem loans led many banks toset aside less in loan-loss provisions. Chemical Banking tooka $625 million restructuring charge for costs associated withits merger with Manufacturers Hanover.   Banks may be hard pressed to hold onto the net interestprofit margins reached last year. But further cost-cuttingand a stronger economy are expected to help boost earningsfor many banks in 1992. The nation's largest bank, Citicorp,is expected to return to profitability while continuing tostruggle with troubled commercial real estate markets.   Earnings of some multiline insurers, including Aetna Lifeandamp; Casualty and Travelers, continued to be hit by sour realestate loans. Lincoln National was hurt by losses from thesale of part of its health insurance business.   Life insurance companies' earnings were buoyed as thefirms took gains in their bond portfolios resulting fromlower interest rates. Some of the companies had a weakyear-earlier period. Torchmark, for example, showed a largeincrease, mainly because the year-earlier earnings weredepressed by a large nonrecurring charge.   The slump in the property and casualty insurance businesscontinued during the fourth quarter, leading to slowerearnings growth for many companies. Investment income fell,mainly because of a drop in premiums to be invested. Somecompanies with large automobile and homeowners businesseswere exceptions to the trend, however. Ohio Casualty, forexample, reported a fourth-quarter earnings surge because oflower claims from automobile accidents.   Major thrifts generally reported robust quarterly results,getting a big boost from wide net interest margins and lowerloan-loss provisions.   Net interest margins are at record levels. For example, atthe nation's largest thrift, H.F. Ahmanson, the spread froseto 3.27% from 2.71% a year earlier. And because spreads maynot decline much during the first half of 1992, results forthe first and second quarters should be as strong, on acomparative basis, as 1991's fourth quarter, said SalomonBrothers analyst Bruce Harting.   Meanwhile, problem-loan growth appears to have slowed atmost of the thrifts. New nonperforming loans were confinedmainly to home mortgages, which are less costly to dispose ofthan commercial property loans.   ---   BANKS                                                                                                          -- MONEY-CENTER BANKS                                                                                                                                       4th Qtr.     4th Qtr.    % 6 Firms                          1991         1990     Chg                                                                                                        BankAmerica                    285,000      287,000  -   1 Bankers Trust NY               137,000      123,000  +  11 Chemical Banking              -420,000        3,000    ...
