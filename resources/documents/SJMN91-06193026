And that led to apublic relations nightmare for the maker of &quot;99 and 44/100 percent pure&quot; Ivorysoap.;    For a time, Pandamp;G got more than 600 calls daily at its Cincinnatiheadquarters about the rumor.;    Pandamp;G fought back by filing lawsuits, hiringprivate investigators and issuing press kits detailing the century-old historyof the logo.;    It was never learned where the rumor began.
