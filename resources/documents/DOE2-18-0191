<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-18-0191 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the past, electric utilities built new plants to meet growth in thedemand for electricity or to replace old, inefficient plants. Today,utilities are considering other options for meeting future demand, suchas conservation programs, load management, purchase of nonutility generation,bulk power purchases, and repowering and life extension (refurbishment)of existing plants. All of these options will play a role in utilities'efforts to meet the demand for electricity. The purpose of this reportis to estimate life-extension capital costs for use by the Energy InformationAdministration (EIA) in its forecasting models. A methodology is developedto estimate the overnight capital costs of life extension for fossil-fuelsteam plants and to estimate average regional and national life-extensioncosts. The report discusses the reasons for the current interest in lifeextension and describes the factors that might influence a utility'sdecision to life-extend. No attempt is made to compare life extensionwith other options for meeting demand. In this study, life extensionrefers to investments made to maintain the operating status of a plantat acceptable levels of availability and efficiency beyond its originallyanticipated retirement date. For modeling purposes, refurbishment isassumed to extend the life of a plant approximately 20 years, with availabilityand efficiency declining over time. More extensive activities, such asrepowering a pulverized coal plant with a fluidized bed system or modifyinga boiler to use other fuels, are not considered in this report. 8 figs.,17 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
