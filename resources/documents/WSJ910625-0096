The findings, which were immediately attacked by anenvironmental group, run counter to predictions made duringthe Gulf War. Such forecasts said that smoke from the fireswould spread globally, block sunlight and cause temperaturesto drop around the planet -- causing a kind of reversegreenhouse effect. The scientists, who flew over the fires inresearch aircraft, said the smoke wasn't as black as expectedand didn't rise into the stratosphere, where it could havebeen transported globally and blocked sunlight for years.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The preliminary findings don't suggest there will bemajor disruptions to global weather or climate,&quot; said RobertCorell, assistant director for geosciences at the NationalScience Foundation, the federal agency that coordinated thestudy.   The findings were assailed by an environmental group,Friends of the Earth, which sent its own observation team toKuwait and held a news conference in Washington two hoursafter the science foundation's news conference ended. &quot;Thesituation is out of control&quot; in Kuwait, said BrentBlackwelder, a Friends of the Earth vice president. Heaccused the U.S. government of deliberately minimizing theenvironmental damage from the fires because it would detractfrom the &quot;glitz and glitter of smashing Iraq.&quot;   The team of scientists estimated that fires from about 500Kuwaiti wells are now consuming about three million barrelsof oil daily, and generating smoke that has spread 800 milessouth. Kuwaiti officials have estimated that most of thefires can be extinguished by early next year, but somefirefighters have said it could take five years to put outall of the fires.   Locally, the temperature effect can be severe. PeterHobbs, a researcher at the University of Washington, saidthat Bahrain had its coldest May in 35 years, withtemperatures 7 1/2 degrees Fahrenheit below the average forthe month. Once the fires are extinguished, another scientistpredicted, surface temperatures should rise above averagebecause the oil spread along the desert floor would absorbheat.   Nevertheless, because of atmospheric physics, the brunt ofthe climate effects will be borne locally, the team said. Assmoke particles rise in the atmosphere, it said, they areattracted to water vapor and fall to Earth in an oily rainbefore reaching the stratosphere. The airborne teams, whichflew between May 16 and June 12, didn't detect any smokeplumes above 22,000 feet, and most were below 15,000 feet.The stratosphere begins at 35,000 feet.   Even locally, the team found little pollution hazard fromsulfur. Alan Bandy, an atmospheric chemist at DrexelUniversity, said the team didn't find any significant levelsof poisonous hydrogen sulfide or carbonyl sulfide. Thescientists did find dense concentrations of sulfur dioxidenear the burning wells. But 250 miles downwind, he said, thesulfur dioxide level was the same as found generally in bigcities.   Lawrence Radke, a researcher at National Center forAtmospheric Research, said the residents of Kuwait City,located near the burning fields, had been spared most of theill effects of the smoke because the wind was blowing south.They would face more danger, he said, if the wind reverseddirection and slowed. But he said that population centers tothe south of Kuwait were far enough away that they should bespared major health problems.   &quot;I wasn't the least worried in Bahrain,&quot; about 225 milessouth of the oil fields.   One of the mysteries the scientists said they couldn't yetresolve was why the smoke from many of the fires was white.Environmentalists and oil-field geologists fear that whitesmoke indicates that water was mixing with oil underground --and severely damaging the oil fields.   But Mr. Radke said that was implausible. Space shuttlepictures of the oil fields taken shortly after the war -- andbefore geologic damage would be expected -- also showed whitesmoke. Rather, he said, the white smoke may indicate thatthere are unidentified minerals mixed in with oil, or thatthe oil is rich in sulfur oxide, which would produce asulfuric acid mist.</TEXT></DOC>
