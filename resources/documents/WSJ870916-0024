But Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke did just that in the July general election. And in the budget his government presented to Parliament yesterday, he delivered on his word.    The government announced that the budget deficit would be slashed to 27 million Australian dollars ($19.7 million) in the year ending next June 30 from 2.72 billion dollars in fiscal 1987, far exceeding expectations that it would be cut only to about 1.5 billion dollars. Calculated as a share of gross national product, the gap would be the narrowest in 35 years.    In reaction to the news, interest rates plunged, the Australian dollar firmed and analysts predicted stocks would move higher. But while the budget gave a boost to the markets, it also presaged greater austerity for the nation as a whole. To Mr. Hawke, that is as it should be. &quot;Australians have got to recognize that we aren't out of the woods yet,&quot; he says. &quot;We've got enormous problems and we have to learn to live within our resources.&quot;    The problems stem from a collapse in the prices of the country's principal exports, minerals and rural produce -- a collapse that exposed the weakness of Australia's woefully uncompetitive manufacturing sector. The result has been a swollen deficit on the current account, the broadest measure of the nation's trade.    In response, Mr. Hawke has pushed down living standards to blunt the appetite for imports. And he has exhorted Australians to &quot;permanently increase standards of effort&quot; in the workplace to make the country's products more competitive.    Hardly vote-winning stuff. Yet at the July poll, voters chose Mr. Hawke's formula of more work for less reward over a promise of huge tax cuts offered by the Liberal opposition. His government was returned for a third consecutive term -- a first for the Australian Labor Party.    Australians, Mr. Hawke says, have been patient with the government's unpalatable strategy, and he hopes they will continue to be for as long as it takes to restructure the economy. &quot;If 16 million people think they can buck the world, they're wrong,&quot; he says in an interview at his Parliament House office. &quot;We are a trading nation.&quot;    Signs are that his strategy is working, though slowly. In fiscal 1987, the current-account deficit totaled 13.4 billion dollars, one billion dollars narrower than a year earlier. Interest rates have been easing. And the government has slashed spending, even on welfare programs that Labor governments historically have defended.    Deciding where to cut has been painful. &quot;Any fat went a long time ago,&quot; says a government official. &quot;Then the flesh went, and now we're cutting into bone.&quot;    The 57-year-old prime minister is a silver-haired man whose deeply lined face falls readily into a scowl when opponents cross him. He is usually wreathed in the fumes of cigars. Tobacco appears to be the only remaining vice of the former trade union official, who used to be infamous for his hard-drinking, libertine life style.    Since entering Parliament in 1980, though, Mr. Hawke has become a self-disciplined figure who shuns alcohol, adheres to a rigid diet and decorates his office with pictures of his grandchildren. To some degree, his transformation mirrors the austerity his government is seeking to impose, and both changes of direction have come as a shock to some of his -- and Labor's -- traditional backers.    During the recent election campaign, Mr. Hawke faced heckling from students and welfare recipients, groups that once formed the heart of Labor's constituency. At the same time, he was feted and praised by entrepreneurs such as the brewing and gold-mining magnate Alan Bond and the media owner Kerry Packer.    His government has been bitterly criticized in some quarters for a spate of decisions that have enriched Mr. Bond and Mr. Packer and other supporters. It has, for example, retained a tax exemption for gold profits and changed media-ownership laws in ways favorable to some of the owners. Providing such windfalls to the wealthy, critics say, clashes with Mr. Hawke's appeal for wage restraint by workers.    Not so, he retorts. &quot;{If} having good relations with industry. . . helps to create a greater degree of cooperation and understanding, well then, it is in the interests of ordinary people,&quot; he says.    He also rejects as &quot;ideological hysteria&quot; criticism by some Labor figures of his push for a Thatcher-style denationalization of major government enterprises.    If Mr. Hawke has alienated segments of the labor movement, he has hardly won the unanimous support of industry. Many business executives consider his economic reforms insufficient. Bob White, managing director of Westpac Banking Corp., says high interest and tax rates continue to stifle competitiveness.    Mr. Hawke agrees that a tight monetary policy has damped investment, but he says other factors are also at work. To back his confidence in the improving picture, he notes that workdays lost in industrial disputes have fallen to an average of 1.4 million a year since his election in 1983 from an average of 3.4 million annually during the four preceding years.    &quot;Without question, there is a much greater degree of understanding in the trade-union movement of the need for us to be competitive,&quot; he says.    While the prime minister has been contending with detractors at home, he has also had to deal with a less-than-cooperative attitude on the part of the Americans. Though he emphasizes the solidity of Australia's military alliance with the U.S., for example, Washington rebuffed him recently by refusing to sign the protocols of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, even though Australia had watered it down to ensure that it wouldn't impinge on U.S. interests. The judgment &quot;wasn't sensible,&quot; he says.    While Mr. Hawke's recent reelection consolidated his political position, it isn't clear whehter he'll want to stay on after his current three-year term ends. &quot;I haven't got any burning ambition to be here forever,&quot; he says. &quot;But I'm still a relatively young man. By the time the next election comes I'll be just short of 60 -- that isn't terribly old.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
