(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Savannah River Plant is moving ahead withplans to ship some of its radioactive waste to New Mexico and a newfederal report estimates environmental cleanup costs at the plantcould reach $6.5 billion.   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,said the Savannah River plant and four other Department of Energynuclear plants should be added to the National Priority List, whichwould mandate schedules for environmental cleanup.   One Energy Department plant, Lawrence Livermore NationalLaboratory in California, is already on the list.   The list is corollary to a list of Superfund projects that needquick cleanup. Federal plants are not eligible for Superfundcleanups, which are administered by the Environmental ProtectionAgency.   The GAO cites an Energy Department estimate of $285 million toclean up 69 waste sites at the Savannah River Plant, but saysrecent information from the Energy Department's headquarters inWashington indicates the total cleanup cost could be as high as$6.5 billion.   Energy Department officials at Savannah River and in Washingtonsaid the cleanup would probably cost between $300 million and $400million, unless the department is required to package hazardouswaste there and remove it from the site.   The cost could then run in the billions of dollars, they said.For all waste sites at the six Energy Department plants, the GAOcited estimates of up to $60 billion.   The Energy Department released an environmental assessmentreport Monday on a proposed ``transuranic'' waste facility atSavannah River.   That facility would prepare Savannah River waste for shipment,starting next year, to the department's Waste Isolation Pilot Plantnear Carlsbad, N.M.   The Energy Department report said the New Mexico plant, whichhas not yet begun receiving shipments, would eventually remove apotential source of groundwater contamination from the plant _thousands of cubic feet of stored waste, containing elementsheavier than uranium, which are called transuranic.   Plutonium, manufactured at the plant for use in nuclear weapons,is one example of a transuranic element.   In addition to the Savannah River and Livermore plants, the GAOnamed Hanford Reservation in Washington, Idaho National EngineeringLaboratory, Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado, and the Y-12 Plant inTennessee as plants that should be added to the cleanup list.   Environmental problems, including contamination of groundwaterwith radioactive, chemical and other hazardous substances, werefound at all six sites, the GAO said.   In some cases, the contamination was detected at levels hundredsto thousands of times above federal drinking water standards.</TEXT></DOC>
