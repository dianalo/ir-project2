The bill, which now goes to the Senate, would give the Councilon Environmental Quality power to require federal agencies to takeinto account the effects of their actions on the world environment.Such issues as acid rain, ocean pollution, the ozone layer andglobal climactic change would come under the council's purview.   The voice vote in the House signaled renewed confidence,particularly among Democrats, in an agency that under Reagan wasseen as having little power, said Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., whosponsored the legislation.   ``The council is minuscule in terms of its budget,'' Studdssaid. But he said it ``really is the spokesman on the environmentfor the president and it sets the tone for the administration.''   Separate legislation, which is now in a House-Senate conferencecommittee, could potentially double the council's budget to $1.5million.   The current chairman of the council is Michael Deland, whoformerly headed the federal Environmental Protection Agency'sBoston office and gained attention for his efforts to clean upBoston Harbor.   Deland said of the White House council Tuesday, ``It did nothave a high visibility for the last eight years, to put it mildly.''   He said the bill approved by the House could serve a valuablesecondary purpose by sending a message to Brazil that the UnitedStates is serious about protecting the global environment.Brazilian officials have criticized the United States for callingfor preservation of the Amazon rain forest while at the same timetolerating pollution within its own borders.   ``Before we can put on our preacher's garb and go to Brazil oranywhere else in the world we need to cleanse our own hands, to getour own house in order,'' Deland said. ``There are a number ofsteps that could be taken here in the U.S. to set an example to tryand help others.''   Under the House bill, federal agencies would have to consideralternatives to any action that would have a harmful effect on theenvironment of another nation or of areas such as Antarctica thatare outside the jurisdiction of any nation.</TEXT></DOC>
