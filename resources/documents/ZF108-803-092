Elbhert is the Director of Operations for HughesCommunications, Inc.andM;Mr.andP;  Elbert sees satellites as being in direct competition with fiber opticsfor the broadband video and data communications market.andP;  Yet, he also claimsit is not in competition because each has their own segment of the overallmarket.andP;  Both techniques are flexible, meaning they can support a mix ofservices.&quot; He claims the advantages of satellite are:andM;*  wide area coverage  country, continent, or hemisphereandM;*  simplicity of operation  a single providerandM;*  higher reliability  - fewer elements to fallandM;*  stable economicsandM;*  common service  - identical transmission equipmentandM;*  low cost per added siteandM;*  quick installation  - no external connection &quot;And ...andP;  it is availabletoday!&quot;andM;The biggest costs involve the construction of the satellite, it's launch, andthe insurance for its operation.andP;  Control and maintenance costs are minimal.andM;There are basically two classes of satellite connectivity.andP;  thepoint-to-point link and the point-to-multipoint link.&quot; For the domesticmarket, point-to-point has become the domain of the fiber (terrestrialcircuit), but internationally, &quot;voice traffic still employs the bulk of INTELSAT's satellite capacity.&quot;andM;He claims there are circumstances where satellite transported communicationsare superior to any terrestrial network.andP;  A good example [of using satellitefor news coverage] is an earthquake  - terrestrial service may be disruptedby the disaster being reported.'andM;The speaker  - as might be expected  - presented a reasonable case for theexistence of satellite communications.andP;  He believes it is a niche market thatwill continue to enjoy a customer need even as the fiber optictelecommunications and the cable TV markets expand and are profitable.andM;&quot;Hughes Communications has recently announced the Sky Cable DBS project ...andO;[which] will build and launch a satellite system that promises to giveconsumers ...andP;  up to 108 TV channels to any U.S.andP;  location.andP;  the network willalso provide the delivery vehicle for HDTV, a technology that is stillstymied by a lack of cooperation among broadcasters.'andM;Satellites are still the best for point-to-multipoint video distribution,while fiber dominates in voice transmission.andP;  However, it is likely thattheir roles will change and exchange  over the coming decades.'andM;This speaker too called for cooperation among the service providers  -including satellite transmission.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
