The Kyoto University scientists said they isolated a genein rats that triggers the production of a protein receptorthrough which certain brain cells communicate. Researchersfamiliar with the finding said they expected the Japanesereport to lead quickly to the discovery of the same gene inhumans, which in turn should help show the receptor's exactrole in brain function.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The {scientific} world is abuzz&quot; about the discovery,said Robert McBurney, vice president for research atCambridge Neuroscience Research Inc., Cambridge, Mass. Thatcompany is one of many searching for drugs that act on thebrain receptor, called NMDA, or N-methyl-Daspartate.   In recent years, researchers have found that a brainchemical called glutamate activates nerve cells in the brainvia the NMDA receptor. The brain cells are widely believed tobe involved in memory. But researchers also have recentlyfound that the same cells can be destroyed by excessiveglutamate that somehow is released following a stroke, severehead injuries, and degenerative brain ailments such asAlzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's disease.   Drug companies believe medicines that deactivate thereceptor could reduce brain damage after a stroke or preventcell death in the degenerative diseases.   Finding the NMDA receptor has been a &quot;holy grail&quot; forbrain biologists for the past two years, wrote Mark Mayer inan editorial accompanying a report of the Japanese finding intoday's issue of the British journal Nature. Mr. Mayer, aresearcher at the National Institute of Child Health andHuman Development, said he expected the discovery will leadother scientists to find other versions of the same receptor,&quot;providing the kind of clear picture we need about the roleof NMDA.&quot;   Scientists have speculated that the NMDA receptor is likea valve, regulating the movement of calcium and otherminerals across the outer membranes of brain cells. Calciumflow is crucial to building memory. But if overloaded withtoo much calcium, cells can perish.   Mr. Mayer said no one expects isolating the NMDA receptorgene will produce immediate advances in drug development.&quot;That'll take some time,&quot; he said. &quot;But having it now willhelp enormously.&quot; Cambridge Neuroscience, for instance,already has an NMDA blocking drug it hopes to begin testingnext year against stroke. The NMDA gene discovery wasreported by Shigetada Nakanishi, Koki Moriyoshi andcolleagues in Kyoto University's Faculty of Medicine.</TEXT></DOC>
