The opticalfibers are perpendicular to the anode wire. With a gas amplificationof 5.5 x 10{sup 0}, a single fiber provides andgt; 60 photoelectrons on thephotocathode of an FEU-85. The space resolution along the anode wireis 4 mm. Use of the center-of-gravity method can improve the coordinateresolution several fold.</TEXT></DOC>
