These standards limitedemissions of particulate matter (PM) from industrial-commercial-institutionalsteam generating units firing coal, wood, and municipal solid waste, andnitrogen oxides (NO<T2>x</T2>) emissions from steam generating units firing natural gas, oil,coal, and waste by-product fuels. Additional standards promulgated on December16, 1987 (52 FR 47826), limited emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<T2>2</T2>) from industrial-commercial-institutional steam generating unitsfiring coal and oil, and PM emissions from units firing oil.Petitions requesting reconsideration of the standards of performance promulgatedon November 25, 1986, were submitted to the Agency in January 1987 by theCouncil of Industrial Boiler Owners (CIBO), Utility Air Regulatory Group(UARG), and the owners of the William H. Zimmer Generating Station (CincinnatiGas andamp; Electric Company, Columbus and Southern Ohio Electric Company,and the Dayton Power and Light Company, referred to hereinafter as theZimmer owners). Petitions requesting reconsideration of the standards ofperformance promulgated on December 16, 1987, were submitted to the Agencyin February, March, and May 1988, by CIBO, Hawaiian Electric Company (HECO),the Zimmer owners, and the American Paper Institute (API) together withthe National Forest Products Association (NFPA).The issues raised by these petitioners do not meet the criteria for reconsiderationof the rule as set out in section 307(d)(7)(B) of the Clean Air Act (CAAor the Act). The petitioners neither raised new objections that were impracticalto present during the specified comment period nor presented new materialof central relevance to the outcome of the rule. Because these petitionsdo not provide substantial support for revising the standards of performancepromulgated on November 25, 1986, and December 16, 1987, they are beingdenied in today's notice. However, using his discretionary authority toreconsider and amend a rule, the Administrator has decided that sufficientreason exists and, therefore, is proposing revisions to parts of the NO<T2>x</T2> rule. (The rationale for this decision is explained more fullyin a separate <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice.) These proposed revisions are discussedelsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register.</T4></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>The denial of the petitions to reconsider these standardsis a final action under sections 307(b)(1) and 307(d)(7)(B) of the CAA.Review of the denial is available only by the filing of a petition forreview in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia within60 days of today's publication, as provided in section 307(b)(1).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Docket Nos.

Subsequently,seven groups petitioned the Administrator pursuant to section 307(d)(7)(B)of the CAA to reconsider certain requirements of these standards.These standards of performance implement section 111 of the Clean Air Actand are based on the Administrator's determination that industrial-commercial-institutionalsteam generating units cause or contribute significantly to air pollutionwhich may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.Industrial-commercial-institutional steam generating units, as a sourcecategory, are the second largest stationary source of PM, NO<T2>x</T2>, and SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from fuel combustion in the nation, ranking only behindelectric utility steam generating units. Further, they were the highestranked source of PM and SO<T2>2</T2> emissions and the second highest ranked source of NO<T2>x</T2> emissions in the NSPS priority list adopted in 1980. The standards,as promulgated, reflect the Administrator's determination of the reductionin emissions (i.e., PM, NO<T2>x</T2>, and SO<T2>2</T2>) achievable by the best demonstrated system of continuous emissionreduction considering costs, nonair quality health and environmental impacts,and energy requirements. [<T3>See</T3> CAA section 111(a)(1)(C).] The basis for specific componentsof the standards as promulgated were set forth in the preambles to thefinal rules (51 FR 47268 and 52 FR 47826) and the various background documentsreferred to in the promulgation notices and contained in the record. Incertain cases, specific percentage reduction requirements were determinedto be unreasonable. Emission limits, however, remain applicable.By and large, the petitions submitted by the parties challenge variousindividual pieces of data, conclusions made by the Agency, or interpretationsof the data. For the most part, the petitions simply restate or expandon issues raised and considered during the comment period or present issuesthat could have been raised during the comment period. To the extent thatnew issues are raised (e.g., the effect of the ``new boiler survey'' onthe PM standards), the petitioners' contentions are either without merit,or even if true, do not affect the outcome of the rule. Although most ofthe contentions raised in the petitions could be rejected summarily, theAgency, in the notice below, has endeavored to provide a comprehensiveresponse to the contentions.Three groups petitioned for reconsideration of the promulgated PM/NO<T2>x</T2> standards. CIBO (Docket No. A-79-02, Docket Item VI-D-2) soughtreconsideration on the basis that the interrelationship with the SO<T2>2</T2> standards was not considered, the environmental and economicimpacts of the standards were overstated, new information gathered in theAgency's own ``Survey of New Industrial Boiler Projects 1981-1984'' (referredto hereinafter as the ``new boiler survey'') (Docket No. A-83-27, ItemIV-A-4) was not considered, and certain aspects of the Industrial FuelChoice Analysis Model (IFCAM) were not valid. The Zimmer owners (DocketNo. A-79-02, Docket Item VI-D-6) petitioned for reconsideration of thePM/NO<T2>x</T2> standards on the basis that NO<T2>x</T2> limits on electric utility auxiliary steam generating unitsare unreasonable and distillate oil NO<T2>x</T2> standards cannot be achieved. UARG (Docket No. A-79-02, DocketItems VI-D-1 and IV-D-4) petitioned for reconsideration on the basis thatNO<T2>x</T2> limits on electric utility auxiliary steam generating unitsare unreasonable.Five groups petitioned for reconsideration of the promulgated SO<T2>2</T2> standards. CIBO (Docket No. A-83-27, Item VI-A-1) petitionedon the basis that the standards are inconsistent with the 1977 amendmentsto the CAA, national energy policy was not considered, the performanceof fluidized bed combustion (FBC) and lime spray drying flue gas desulfurization(FGD) systems was not demonstrated, new information on waste disposal impactswas discovered after the comment period closed, the exemption from percentreduction requirements for noncontinental areas is arbitrary, new analysesmade available after proposal of the standard (especially information fromthe ``new boiler survey'') were not given sufficient consideration, andinformal vendor statements were used to support the requirement for 90percent SO<T2>2</T2> reduction. The Zimmer owners (Docket No. A-83-27, Item VI-A-4)petitioned on the basis that the impacts of a 130 ng/J (0.30 lb/millionBtu) heat input emission limit for SO<T2>2</T2> on two oil-fired electric utility auxiliary steam generatingunits at the Zimmer Station are unreasonable. HECO (Docket No. A-83-27,Item VI-A-5) requested reconsideration on the basis that the impacts ofa 130 ng/J (0.30 lb/million Btu) heat input emission limit for SO<T2>2</T2> on oil-fired steam generating units in Hawaii are unreasonable.API and NFPA (Docket No. A-83-27, Item VI-A-6) sought reconsideration onthe basis that the lack of provisions for start-up, shutdown, and malfunctionis unreasonable.The next section of today's notice discusses the content of each petitionrelative to the criteria set forth in section 307(d)(7)(B) of the CAA forrequiring the Administrator to convene a proceeding to reconsider the promulgatedstandards.

Criteria for Reconsideration under Section 307Review of these petitions for reconsideration was carried out accordingto the procedures of section 307 of the Clean Air Act. Section 307(d)(7)(B)provides that: <ITAG tagnum="21">[i]f the person raising an objection can demonstrate to the Administratorthat it was impracticable to raise such objection within [the comment period]or if the grounds for such objection arose after the period for publiccomment (but within the time specified for judicial review) and if suchobjection is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule, the Administratorshall convene a proceeding for reconsideration of the rule. . . .</ITAG>As the relevant House report explains, the purpose of section 307(d)(7)(B)is to provide the Agency an opportunity ``to pass on the significance ofthe [new] materials and determine whether supplementary proceedings arecalled for or not.'' (See ``Legislative History of the Clean Air Act Amendmentsof 1977,'' Volume 4, p. 2790.)Objections are of central relevance only if they provide substantial supportfor the argument that the standards should be revised. [See Denial of Petitionto Revise NSPS for Stationary Gas Turbines, 45 FR 81653 (December 11, 1980);Response to Petition for Reconsideration and Final Amendments, NSPS forPetroleum Dry Cleaners, 50 FR 49022, (November 27, 1985).] Using the section307(d)(7)(B) criteria, each of the seven petitions was reviewed to determinewhether material of central relevance to the rule was presented that couldnot have been presented during the comment period. For reasons summarizedbelow and detailed later in this notice, it is apparent that none of thepetitions presents this kind of material. In a separate notice in today's<T4>Federal Register</T4>, however, the Administrator is exercising hisdiscretionary authority to propose revised rules for monitoring NO<T2>x</T2> emission from very low capacity factor steam generating units.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Section 4(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),U.S.C. 553(e), states, ``Each agency shall give an interested person theright to petition for issuance, amendment or repeal of a rule.'' AlthoughSection 4(d) of the APA also establishes a right to petition for administrativereconsideration, that provision almost certainly does not apply to petitionsfor reconsideration of regulations that are promulgated pursuant to therulemaking provisions of Section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act. See section307(d)(1)(N), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(1)(N). (``The provisions of section 553through 557 * * * of Title 5 of the United States Code shall not, exceptas expressly provided in this subsection, apply to action to which thissubsection applies.'') In any event, the criteria for evaluating a petitionfor reconsideration under APA are essentially the same as those for section307(d)(7)(B) petitions. <T3>See</T3> Denial of Petitions to Revise NSPS for Stationary Gas Turbines,45 FR 81653-54, and decisions cited therein. B. Summary of PM/NO<T2>x</T2> Reconsideration Petitions <ITAG tagnum="81">1. UARG </ITAG>UARG submitted a petition contending that EPA did not respond to the specificsof arguments it had made on the proposed rule. Further, UARG supplementedthis petition with arguments that no standards should be imposed on verylow capacity factor utility auxiliary steam generating units. UARG alsosought deletion of the monitoring requirements on the grounds that therequirements cannot be applied readily to units that are used infrequently.These arguments do not compel reconsideration under section 307. First,a claim that EPA's response to comments was incomplete does not triggersection 307 reconsideration. Second, the information provided in UARG's``supplement'' could have been provided during the comment period. Thesame is true of the arguments concerning monitoring. UARG's comments arediscussed in Section III below. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Zimmer Owners </ITAG>The Zimmer owners argued that EPA failed to address their comments on theproposed standards. In a supplement dated June 29, 1987, 7 months afterthe standards were promulgated, the Zimmer owners argued that the standardsshould not apply to utility auxiliary units for legal and economic reasons.As the Zimmer owners themselves seemed to recognize, their reconsiderationcomments generally repeated and expanded on arguments raised during thecomment period. Such comments do not compel reconsideration under section307. The Zimmer owners' comments are discussed in Section III below. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. CIBO </ITAG>CIBO argued that two post-proposal developments in the SO<T2>2</T2> proceeding compel reconsideration of the PM/NO<T2>x</T2> rule under section 307. The two developments were EPA's proposalof an ``interrelated'' SO<T2>2</T2> standard after proposal (but before promulgation) of the PM/NO<T2>x</T2> standards and the imminent (in early 1987) completion of a ``newboiler survey'' in the SO<T2>2</T2> rulemaking. These developments do not compel reconsideration under section 307 becausethey do not constitute information of central relevance to the outcomeof the PM/NO<T2>x</T2> rulemaking. EPA has long recognized and taken into account theinterrelated character of the PM/NO<T2>x</T2> and SO<T2>2</T2> rules. CIBO's argument, therefore, does not provide new information.The only respect in which the argument could be considered new is in CIBO'sconjecture that the NO<T2>x</T2> standard could be violated in steam generating units designedfor firing pulverized coal (PC) when using natural gas or oil. As explainedbelow in Section III, however, EPA believes that compliance with the NO<T2>x</T2> standards can be readily accomplished by such units, and CIBOhas provided no data to support its comments. CIBO's comments on the interrelationshipof the PM/NO<T2>x</T2> and SO<T2>2</T2> rules are discussed in Section III below. CIBO's claims that the projections of new units were too high and its conjecturesregarding the ``new boiler survey'' do not compel reconsideration undersection 307. As explained in Section III below, new projections of theabsolute number of new and replacement steam generating units are informative,but far less important in regulatory analysis than the relative balancebetween costs and benefits. When deciding whether or not to regulate, itis the relative balance between costs and benefits that is of primary importancerather than the absolute numbers. However, even with lower projectionsof the number of new units, the emission reductions achieved by the standardsare significant. Conjecture regarding the methods of the ``new boiler survey''is also not a basis for mandatory reconsideration absent compelling indicationsthat the survey methods affected the results. CIBO's critiques are not,therefore, of central relevance to the outcome of the rule. C. Summary of SO<T2>2</T2> Reconsideration Petitions<ITAG tagnum="81">1. CIBO</ITAG>CIBO argued that (1) the SO<T2>2</T2> standards are inconsistent with the 1977 amendments to the CAA,(2) national energy policy was not considered, (3) EPA erroneously analyzedthe results of a ``new boiler survey,'' (4) the ``new boiler survey'' producedimportant new information, (5) post-proposal waste disposal informationshowed that flue gas desulfurization (FGD) on coal-fired units is not costeffective, (6) post-proposal fluidized bed combustion (FBC) and spray dryerinformation did not show that they constitute ``demonstrated technologies,(7) EPA did not provide notice of the extent of its reliance on vendorguarantees, and (8) EPA should have extended its unanticipated exemptionfrom percent reduction requirements for noncontinental areas to the continentalUnited States. CIBO argued that these post-proposal developments compelreconsideration under section 307(d)(7)(B). This is not the case. The issues of consistency with the 1977 amendmentsto the CAA and national energy policy were raised and discussed at lengthprior to proposal as well as during the comment period. [See e.g., ``BackgroundInformation Document'' (BID), Volume 4.] Such comments, therefore, do notcompel reconsideration under section 307. Concerning the analysis of the ``new boiler survey,'' EPA surveyed steamgenerating unit sales from 1981 to 1984 to determine why new steam generatingunits are installed, what percentage of recent sales were for replacement,how sales might be related to increased cost, and the impact of new unitson overall SO<T2>2</T2> emissions. The survey was conducted to respond to CIBO commentsthat the great majority of new units replace existing units and that theNSPS would prompt owners to delay purchasing replacement units. CIBO suggestedthat EPA's analysis of the ``new boiler survey'' is faulty and argued thathad EPA correctly analyzed the survey, the outcome of the rule would havebeen different.\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ That EPA was going to conduct the ``new boiler survey''was noted in the June 19, 1986, notice of proposed rulemaking (51 FR 22384).Notice of the availability of the study was sent to all commenters in April1987, informing them that new analyses were being added to Docket A-83-27.Again, this is not the case. The findings of the survey indicate that althoughreplacement was the primary reason for many new units, a roughly equalnumber of units are installed for new applications. The survey also foundthat the decision to build most of these new application units was notsensitive to cost increases in the range expected to result from the newrules. Findings from the survey also indicated that many existing unitswould continue to be used alongside the replacement units. In its petition, CIBO hypothesized that the answers received from the surveymight have been different if the survey had asked whether the unit wouldbe built if air pollution control equipment were required. However, CIBOprovided no details to support this conjecture. Unsupported conjecturedoes not provide a basis for reconsideration under section 307. As discussedin greater detail in Section IV below, the amount, not the origin, of costsseems relevant to elasticity of sales as a function of costs. The replacementrate may affect the number of unit sales, but in the final analysis_andabsent volume price decreases_the relationship between control costs andabsolute emission reductions is more relevant to standard setting. CIBO also argued that, apart from costs, reliability needs also deter newunit installation if pollution control systems are less reliable than productionfacilities. On August 19, 1988, it provided EPA with a ``supplement'' attachingletters attesting to the need for high rates of facility reliability. Thisargument does not provide a basis for reconsideration under section 307.The general point_the need for high steam generating unit reliability_wasraised at the time of proposal and addressed during the comment period[See e.g., BID, Volume 4 (EPA-450/3-87-024)]. The specific argument thatthis need, like increased costs, could deter new installation could havebeen made at that time. Factored into the analysis was the cost of backupsystems generally used by industry to ensure steam supply. Use of suchbackup systems should assure reliable operation and should not significantlyaffect installation rates. Even if backup systems did affect installationrates, the point remains that the number of new units and replacement unitsis less relevant to standard setting than the relationship between controlcosts and emissions. CIBO argued that the ``new boiler survey,'' properly analyzed, supportedits claim that EPA overstated emission reductions. For reasons explainedin Section IV below, CIBO's argument does not provide information of centralrelevance to the outcome of the rule compelling reconsideration under section307. The reasonableness of the rule, considering costs, is not significantlyaffected by the total number of projected unit installations since smallerpopulation projections would mean a corresponding reduction of controlcosts. Furthermore, CIBO simply renews a contention that was raised anddiscussed during the comment period. (See e.g., BID, Volume 4.) CIBO also argued that a post-proposal memorandum, which was prepared forEPA and discussed the disposal of sodium-scrubbing waste, coupled withEPA's ``reliance'' on sodium-scrubbing, shows the ``impracticability''of the rule_or, rather, that the rule renders ``impracticable'' the useof coal-fired steam generating units. The post-proposal memorandum notes,among other things, that several sodium scrubbers are located in areaswhere local rules might limit the availability of some scrubbing wastedisposal options (Docket No. A-83-27, Docket Item IV-B-12).The issue of scrubber waste disposal was raised and thoroughly discussedboth prior to proposal and during the comment period. (See e.g., BID, Volume4.) CIBO's comments on the post-proposal memorandum do not compel reconsiderationunder section 307. The possibility that some sources may be limited intheir disposal options does not change the outcome of the rule.CIBO also argued that post-proposal memoranda prepared for EPA do not showthat fluidized bed combustion (FBC) and lime spray dry scrubbers are ``demonstrated''technologies. (See e.g., Docket No. A-83-27, Docket Items IV-B-18 and IV-B-97.)CIBO's critique of the post-proposal memoranda does not compel reconsiderationunder section 307. The Agency's conclusion that FBC and lime spray dryersare ``demonstrated'' technologies was explained prior to proposal and againin response to public comments [See e.g., BID, Volume 4; 52 FR 47837; and``Summary of Regulatory Analysis'' (EPA-450/3-86-005).] The EPA's conclusionin the final rule, as well as at proposal, was based on the judgment thattest data and other factors indicate that high levels of reliability areachievable. The post-proposal memoranda, while providing additional supportfor this conclusion, were far from its sole support. Critiques of the memoranda,therefore, are not centrally relevant to the finding that these technologiesare demonstrated for purposes of Section 111 of The CAA. The merit of CIBO'scritiques is discussed in Section IV below.CIBO argued that EPA did not provide notice of the ``extent'' of its relianceon vendor guarantees with respect to the demonstrated status of lime spraydryers and that EPA improperly relied on a guarantee that was informaland unenforceable. This comment does not constitute centrally relevantnew information compelling reconsideration under section 307. As CIBO'scomment acknowledges, the possibility that EPA might refer to vendor guaranteeswas evident during the comment period. (See e.g., ``Summary of RegulatoryAnalysis.'') Moreover, as is discussed in Section IV below, EPA's determinationthat lime spray drying technology is demonstrated was based on engineeringreview of lime spray dryer designs, test data, and other information thatindicate that this technology is demonstrated. The vendor guarantees weremerely corroborative of this conclusion.CIBO argued that the exemption for noncontinental areas from the percentreduction requirement should apply to all areas where natural gas is unavailable.The comment is essentially a moot point. The noncontinental exemption appliesin practice only to units firing very low sulfur oil. The final standard,in fact, exempts all sources firing very low sulfur oil from the percentreduction requirement, no matter where they are located.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Zimmer Owners</ITAG>The Zimmer owners argued that information provided in their petition showsthat use of 130 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) oil is not cost effective relative to using a highersulfur content oil. This comment does not compel reconsideration undersection 307. The original exemption at the time of proposal was based ona heat input limitation of 86 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.20 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu), and the exemption in the final rule was basedon 130 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb/million Btu). The Zimmer owners' concerns about thecost effectiveness of various low sulfur oils could have been raised duringthe comment period. The Zimmer owners' comment is discussed in more detailin Section IV below.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. HECO</ITAG>The final rule, unlike the proposal, exempted oil-fired units in noncontinentalareas from the percent reduction requirement, but limited emissions tothe equivalent of 130 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb. SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu). HECO argued that no notice of the 0.30 requirementwas given, that the emissions limit should be raised to 210 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.50 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) on Oahu, and that no limit should be imposed elsewherein Hawaii.This argument does not compel reconsideration under section 307. It istrue, as HECO claims, that the emission limit of 130 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) was developed after (and as a result of) the commentperiod. The Agency had, however, established an 86 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.20 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) limit as the basis for a percent reduction exemption.HECO's objections could have been raised during the comment period becauseits objections are based on the cost and/or current unavailability of verylow sulfur oil, i.e., they apply to both the proposed emission limit andthe final emission limit. Further, the standard does not require use of130 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) oil, but rather allows the owner to meet this emissionlimit by whatever means the owner chooses. HECO's comments are discussedin more detail in Section IV below.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. API/NFPA</ITAG>API and NFPA argued that new post-proposal materials and analyses showedthat various backup strategies for maintaining compliance during periodsof planned and unplanned outages (i.e., start-ups, shutdowns, and malfunctions)are not available.This comment does not compel reconsideration under Section 307 becausethe information in the API/NFPA petition, including information about demandcharges and premiums for noninterruptible supplies of natural gas, wasaddressed in response to comments or could have been presented during thepublic comment period.

Petitions Submitted Concerning the PM/NO<T2>x</T2> Standards</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Achievability of NO</ITAG><T2>x</T2> Standards by Distillate Oil-Fired Electric Utility AuxiliarySteam Generating Units<T3>Petitioner's Comment: </T3>The Zimmer owners commented that electricutility auxiliary steam generating units that fire distillate oil cannotconsistently meet the NO<T2>x</T2> standard of 43 ng NO<T2>x</T2>/J (0.10 lb NO<T2>x</T2>/million Btu) heat input.<T3>Agency Response: </T3>Electric utility auxiliary steam generating unitsare large field-erected units. These units are characterized by low volumetricheat release rates, typically below 310,000 J/sec-m\3\ (30,000 Btu/hourft\3\). Heat release rate is one of the major factors in determining theNO<T2>x</T2>-generating potential of a unit firing distillate oil and theability of control techniques to limit NO<T2>x</T2> emissions. Data show that NO<T2>x</T2> emissions increase as heat release rate increases, all otherthings being equal. Emission test data available from three distillateoil-fired steam generating units employing staged combustion demonstratethat NO<T2>x</T2> emissions can be limited to 43 ng NO<T2>x</T2>/J (0.10 lb NO<T2>x</T2>/million Btu) or below through the use of this technique. (SeeDocket No. A-79-02, Docket Items II-I-224, II-A-9, and II-A-14.) One ofthe units used a staged combustion burner while the other units used stagedcombustion air. These steam generators are packaged units with volumetricheat release rates of 460,000 to 490,000 J/sec-m\3\ (45,000 to 48,000 Btu/hour-ft\3\),which are higher than those typical for electric utility auxiliary units.Since the heat release rates for electric utility auxiliary units are substantiallybelow those of the tested steam generating units, NO<T2>x</T2> emissions can be limited to 43 ng NO<T2>x</T2>/J (0.10 lb NO<T2>x</T2>/million Btu) heat input or less through the use of staged combustionwhen firing distillate oil. Moreover, other NO<T2>x</T2> limitation techniques, such as flue gas recirculation, are availablewhich have been shown to be capable of limiting NO<T2>x</T2> emissions to 43 ng NO<T2>x</T2>/J (0.10 lb NO<T2>x</T2>/million Btu) or less in distillate oil-fired steam generatingunits with heat release rates up to 640,000 J/sec-m\3\ (62,000 Btu/hour-ft\3\).(See Docket No. A-79-02, Docket Items II-I-224 and IV-B-23.) Accordingly,there is no basis for granting the request by the Zimmer owners for a higherNO<T2>x</T2> limit.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Special Monitoring Problems Associated with Electric Utility AuxiliarySteam Generating Units</ITAG><T3>Petitioner's Comment: </T3>UARG contended that the monitoring requirementsin the NO<T2>x</T2> standards would be difficult, if not impossible, for very lowcapacity factor steam generating units to meet. Specifically, the petitionerclaimed that facilities such as oil-fired utility auxiliary steam generatingunits would not be able to satisfy the initial performance test requirementto be completed within 180 days of initial start-up because a unit thatoperates only 2 or 3 days per month, for example, would take an entireyear to satisfy these performance test requirements.Similarly, the petitioner claimed that the 30-day rolling average compliancetest for these same units would not produce meaningful data because itis unlikely that enough data would be collected in 1 year to calculateeven one 30-day average.<T3>Agency's Response: </T3>The Agency does not agree with the petitioner'scontention that the NO<T2>x</T2> monitoring requirements cannot be met by very low capacity factorsteam generating units. The initial performance test is based on emissionsdata collected during the first 30 operating days following unit start-up(operation of a unit for a single hour during a given day qualifies asan operating day). Up to 180 calendar days can be used to collect these30 days of operating data. Many very low capacity factor units may be ableto gather 30 days of data through collection of NO<T2>x</T2> emissions data in conjunction with commercial acceptance testingof the unit and during normal operating days. If insufficient operatingdays occur during the first 180 calendar days, the owner can operate theunit and vent steam to collect the additional NO<T2>x</T2> emissions data necessary. If collection of such data is consideredinfeasible for an individual unit, the owner can apply to the Administratorfor relief under andSection; 60.8(b) of the General Provisions of 40 CFRPart 60.The petitioner misunderstands the mechanics of how 30-day rolling averagesare calculated in contending that insufficient data would be collectedin a year to calculate 30-day averages. A 30-day rolling average is calculatedas the average of all daily average data collected during the previous30 consecutive steam generating unit operating days. The first 30-day averageis calculated after initial unit start-up and serves as the initial performancetest. Thereafter, a new 30-day rolling-average is calculated at the endof each new steam generating unit operating day.B. Interrelationship of PM/NO<T2>x</T2> and SO<T2>2</T2> Standards<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Effect of SO</ITAG><T2>2</T2> Control Techniques on PM/NO<T2>x</T2><T3>Petitioner's Comment: </T3>CIBO stated that EPA proposed a stringent(90 percent reduction) SO<T2>2</T2> standard after proposal of the PM/NO<T2>x</T2> NSPS, but ignored economic and technical interrelationshipsbetween the proposed SO<T2>2</T2> standards and the promulgated PM/NO<T2>x</T2> standards. According to the petitioner, all of these combustionproducts (PM, NO<T2>x</T2>, and SO<T2>2</T2>) are critically interrelated and, therefore, should not havebeen considered under two separate NSPS. The petitioner pointed out thatimplementation of control techniques to satisfy the SO<T2>2</T2> standards will affect the control techniques necessary to satisfythe PM/NO<T2>x</T2> standards, both from a technical feasibility and a cost standpoint.The petitioner also stated that no opportunity was given for public commenton the technical or cost impact of the SO<T2>2</T2> standards on the PM/NO<T2>x</T2> standards.<T3>Agency Response: </T3>Although NSPS for PM/NO<T2>x</T2> and SO<T2>2</T2> were developed in separate regulatory actions, potential technicalor economic interrelationships were considered throughout the developmentof regulations for each pollutant and fuel type. For example, because PMand SO<T2>2</T2> emissions and control technologies for oil-fired units are closelyinterrelated, the PM and SO<T2>2</T2> standards for oil were considered in the same regulatory action.Relationships between the use of a fabric filter or electrostatic precipitator(ESP) to reduce PM emissions and a flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systemto reduce SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from coal-fired steam generating units were also identified,but were found to be separable, and were therefore analyzed in separateregulatory actions. Possible interrelationships between NO<T2>x</T2> and SO<T2>2</T2> control were also considered, but no significant interrelationshipswere identified.Further, when evaluating alternative SO<T2>2</T2> standards for coal-fired units, the Agency assumed that theproposed PM and NO<T2>x</T2> standards were already in effect and that new units were constructedand operated to comply with them. This approach ensured that even minortechnical and cost interrelationships between the standards for PM, NO<T2>x</T2>, and SO<T2>2</T2> were implicitly considered during the course of the SO<T2>2</T2> rulemaking. Accordingly, the petitioner's contention that theAgency did not consider the interrelationship between the PM/NO<T2>x</T2> and SO<T2>2</T2> standards is incorrect.Finally, during the comment period on the proposed SO<T2>2</T2> standards, the public could have commented on technical andeconomic interrelationships among the PM, NO<T2>x</T2>, and SO<T2>2</T2> standards. However, no significant interrelationships were identifiedby any of the commenters. Furthermore, mere conjuncture is not a basisfor granting a petition for reconsideration. Only one specific interrelationshipof the standards was identified by the petitioners and, as is explainedbelow, it does not impose unreasonable impacts.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Achievability of NO</ITAG><T2>x</T2> Standards by Pulverized Coal-Fired Units When Using Backup Fuelto Meet SO<T2>2</T2> Standards<T3>Petitioners Comment: </T3>As a specific example to illustrate the PM/NO<T2>x</T2>/SO<T2>2</T2> interrelationship, CIBO cited a field-erected pulverized coal(PC)-fired steam generating unit firing natural gas or oil as a backupfuel. The petitioner stated that firing backup fuels in PC units will becomemore frequent and prolonged than in the past because of FGD system reliabilityproblems, fuel disruptions, and fuel price variations. According to thepetitioner, all PC units are equipped with air preheaters, which typicallydeliver preheated air at 110 to 160 anddegrees;C (400 to 600 anddegrees;F)for combustion of both primary and backup fuels. Such high air temperatures,which increase the formation of thermal NO<T2>x</T2>, restrict the ability of units with volumetric heat releaserates below 720,000 J/sec-M\3\ (70,000 Btu/hour-ft\3\) to meet the 43 ngNO<T2>x</T2>/J (0.10 lb NO<T2>x</T2>/million Btu) heat input NSPS for natural gas for distillateoil combustion. Since using backup fuel is part of the basis for the SO<T2>2</T2> standards, the petitioner stated that this requirement mustbe considered in the NO<T2>x</T2> standards and the necessary relief must be provided in the formof a higher NO<T2>x</T2> emission rate for PC units firing natural gas or distillateoil with air preheat.<T3>Agency Response: </T3>Coal-fired steam generating units inherentlyhave larger furnace volumes than oil- and natural gas-fired units withequivalent steam generating capacities. Because of the lower heat releaserates in these larger furnace volumes, conversion of atmospheric nitrogento NO<T2>x</T2> while firing backup fuels in a field-erected PC-fired steamgenerating unit is lower than in a smaller, higher heat release rate steamgenerating unit designed to fire natural gas or oil. To assure that propercombustion conditions are achieved to minimize NO<T2>x</T2> formation, a number of NO<T2>x</T2> reduction techniques are available. These techniques includereducing combustion air temperature by either total or partial bypass ofthe air preheater, and using flue gas recirculation, overfire air ports,and low NO<T2>x</T2> burners to fire backup fuels. Data from units employing stagedcombustion burner (SCB) or staged combustion air technology indicate thatthese controls can meet the 43 ng NO<T2>x</T2>/J (0.10 lb NO<T2>x</T2>/million Btu) heat input limit when firing natural gas or oilin units with heat release rates below 720,000 J/sec-m\3\ (70,000 Btu/hour-ft\3\).In addition, one low NO<T2>x</T2> burner manufacturer stated that NO<T2>x</T2> emissions can be limited to 43 ng NO<T2>x</T2>/J (0.10 lb NO<T2>x</T2>/million Btu) heat input while firing natural gas if the unitheat release rate is less than 770,000 J/sec-m\3\ (75,000 Btu/hour-ft\3\).(See Docket No. A-79-02, Docket Item IV-E-14.)Industrial field-erected units have heat release rates well below theselevels. A survey of such units installed between 1982 and 1986 identifiednine PC-fired units. (See Docket No. A-83-27, Docket Items IV-J-4, IV-J-5,IV-J-7, and IV-J-9, and IV-J-42.) The heat release rates for these unitsranged from 140,000 to 245,000 J/sec-m\3\ (13,500 to 23,700 Btu/hour-ft\3\).Since these heat release rates are substantially below the upper limitsof 720,000 to 770,000 J/sec-m\3\ (70,000 to 75,000 Btu/hour-ft\3\) identifiedabove, NO<T2>x</T2> emissions can be reduced to 43 ng NO<T2>x</T2>/J (0.10 lb NO<T2>x</T2>/million Btu) heat input or less through use of the above NO<T2>x</T2> reduction techniques when firing natural gas or oil as a backupfuel. Accordingly, there is no basis for granting the CIBO request fora higher NO<T2>x</T2> limit or convening a proceeding to reconsider the interrelationshipbetween the PM/NO<T2>x</T2> and SO<T2>2</T2> standards.C. Projected Environmental and Economic Impacts<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Overstatement of Impacts</ITAG><T3>Petitioner's Comment: </T3>EPA projected that 725 new steam generatingunits with heat input over 29 MW (100 million Btu) would be built in the5-year period following proposal. CIBO stated that this number is too high(CIBO contended that 250 new units are more likely, of which 80 percentare replacement units) and, as a result, the projected economic, environmental,and energy impacts associated with the PM/NO<T2>x</T2> standards are overstated. The petitioner cited the Agency'sown ``new boiler survey'' to support its contention. The petitioner contendedthat the survey shows that the number of ``new'' steam generating unitsas opposed to ``replacement'' units was overestimated, that purchase ofreplacement units is discretionary, and that the impact of the standardswill be to further reduce the number of replacement units during the periodmodeled, given the high cost of complying with the standards. Thus, CIBOargued that the projected emission reductions achieved by the standardsare significantly overestimated.<T3>Agency's Response:</T3> As explained in the response to comments inthe SO<T2>2</T2> rulemaking (see e.g., 52 FR 47826), several factors suggestthat 1984 estimates of steam generating unit population and total ``new''emissions were high. These estimates of new steam generating units werebased on U.S. Department of Energy projections made in the late 1970's.(See e.g., BID, Volume 4.) As the Agency explained, however, any changein the overall balance between the costs and benefits and, hence the reasonablenessof the standard, depends on the relative change in both costs and benefits.If EPA has overestimated the number of new units subject to the standard,then <T3>both</T3> the costs as well as the emission reductions (i.e., benefits)of the standard decrease. EPA's conclusion as to the standard would remainvalid even if CIBO's estimates, or lower ones, proved more accurate.  The total number of new steam generating units and the percentage of theseunits that are replacements was examined in the ``new boiler survey.''The survey results suggest that about half of all unit installations from1981 to 1984 represented replacements of existing units. However, for fourreasons, the fact that a significant number of new units are replacementsfor existing units does not support CIBO's claims that lower-than-projectedemissions reduction compel reconsideration. First, replacement capacitymay simply displace existing capacity in an accounting sense, but it represents<T3>new</T3> capacity under section 111 of the Clean Air Act. Therefore,the petitioner's exclusion of replacement capacity from its calculationsof baseline emissions increases is not warranted. Second, the suggestionthat replacement should not be counted because it is discretionary andmight be deferred is unfounded. Deferring replacement is simply replacementdisplaced in time to a later date. Third, the ``new boiler survey'' resultsindicate that the decision to install new steam generating units is notsignificantly cost sensitive in the range of cost increases anticipatedby the Agency. Fourth, with respect to projected post-NSPS emission levels,many of the replaced units are not retired but continue in service.  <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Legal Basis for and Economic Impacts of Controls on Electric UtilityAuxiliary Steam Generating Units  </ITAG><T3>Petitioner's Comment:</T3> In their petitions, UARG and the Zimmerowners argued that Subpart Db should not apply to auxiliary utility steamgenerating units that are used to assist in start-up and shutdown of themain steam generating unit because these units are not significant contributors,operate at very low capacity factors, use oil or natural gas, operate intermittently,and are located in rural areas. The petitioners also contended that anystandards for PM/NO<T2>x</T2> would result in excessive cost impacts on electric utility auxiliarysteam generating units relative to units operated at higher capacity factors.According to the petitioners, the standards would also have minimal impacton reducing PM and NO<T2>x</T2> emissions beyond those achieved by current unit designs. Therefore,the petitioners recommended that the final standards be amended to either(1) exempt utility auxiliary steam generating units from the standards;(2) adopt a capacity factor cut-off for the promulgated standards and establishdifferent levels of control for units that operate at very low annual capacityfactor levels, such as 10 percent or less; or (3) reduce the burden imposedby NO<T2>x</T2> monitoring requirements on steam generating units that operateat very low annual capacity factors.\3\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Zimmer owners also contended that section 111(f) barsEPA from determining that utility auxiliary steam generating units arewithin the category of units subject to Subpart Db and, simultaneously,in regulating such units, section 111(f) requires that EPA establish alist of major stationary source categories and establish deadlines forregulation. The Zimmer owners do not explain their interpretation of section111(f). On its face, section 111(f) contains no such bar.  <T3>Agency Response:</T3> As the Agency stated in its June 19, 1984, proposedrule (49 FR 25156), all steam generating units with a heat input capacitygreater than 29 MW (100 million Btu/hour) (other than those units subjectto Subpart Da) were included within the Subpart Db rule (51 FR 42794).The Agency included very low capacity factor units on the basis that thedesign of these units and control technologies for emission reductionsare similar, irrespective of capacity factor. As was noted in the finalrule, ``there is no requirement that each subcategory of a listed categoryor each individual source within a listed category also be a significantcontributor.'' (See 51 FR 42795; <T3>see also</T3> 51 FR 42772.) It was thereby determined that auxiliaryutility steam generating units are subject to Subpart Db.  The Agency does not agree that the criteria set forth by UARG and the Zimmerowners provide a basis for EPA to subcategorize utility auxiliary steamgenerating units. No doubt there are multiple bases upon which SubpartDb steam generating units could be subcategorized. Criteria such as ownershipand/or the existence of companion base load units (i.e., units owned byutilities, or units auxiliary to base load units) do not seem to be functionallyuseful. An exemption for rural settings is inconsistent with the conceptof section 111, which contemplates national standards and does not distinguishamong regions based on air quality achieved. Capacity factor, althoughrelated to the level of emissions, is unsuitable as a basis for exemptionfrom all standards where emission control remains cost effective; as thefinal rule recognizes, however, capacity factor is an appropriate criterionfor exemption where emission control is not cost effective.  As discussed in a separate rulemaking notice published today elsewherein the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the Administrator, under his discretionary authority,is proposing to amend the NO<T2>x</T2> performance testing and monitoring requirements for steam generatingunits that operate at very low annual capacity factors (less than 10 percent)and that fire natural gas, distillate oil, or low nitrogen residual oil(either alone or in combination). The proposed rule imposes less burdensomeperformance testing and monitoring requirements on large steam generatingunits and exempts small steam generating units from the NO<T2>x</T2> standards.  The Agency also does not agree that auxiliary utility steam generatingunits should be exempted from the performance standards for PM and NO<T2>x</T2> on the basis that minimal emission reductions will be achieved.Although most auxiliary utility units may be designed to fire oils withPM emission potentials of less than 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/million Btu) and maybe equipped with low NO<T2>x</T2> burners, the performance standards provide a ``cap'' to assurethat these units are operated in a manner that minimizes emissions. Establishmentof performance standards as a ``cap'' to limit future emissions is a validexercise of regulatory authority.   D. ``New Boiler Survey''  <ITAG tagnum="81">Consideration of New Information Gathered in the ``New Boiler Survey.'' </ITAG><T3>Petitioner's Comments:</T3> CIBO stated that EPA recognized the importanceof steam generating unit replacement when it announced that it had initiateda ``new boiler survey'' to gather information regarding the impact of theNSPS on new steam generating unit construction and refurbishment (51 FR16586). The petitioner contended that many new steam generating units arereplacements for existing units and, in most cases, these new units representdiscretionary expenditures by unit owners. As a result, if the cost ofa new unit is too high, the owner will continue to use the existing unit.Because existing units frequently have higher emission rates than new units,failure to install new units will result in higher emission levels andfewer reductions than claimed by the Agency. The petitioner contended thatEPA should recalculate the net reduction in emissions from steam generatingunit replacement in its analysis and modify the final rule to encourageeconomic replacement of higher emitting, existing units.  <T3>Agency Reponse:</T3> Two questions are relevant here: First, what isthe impact of the PM/NO<T2>x</T2> standards on the rate of steam generating unit installations;and second, what are the implications of the ``new boiler survey'' forthe PM/NO<T2>x</T2> rule. Regarding the first of these questions, the ``new boilersurvey'' was conducted in response to public comments on the proposed SO<T2>2</T2> standards. It focused on collecting data about the reasons newunits are installed, the extent to which new units may be replacementsfor existing units, and the impact of new units on overall SO<T2>2</T2> emisssions. The survey did not directly examine PM/NO<T2>x</T2> emissions. However, based on the survey data and earlier analysesof the cost of PM and NO<T2>x</T2> control techniques, the impact of the PM/NO<T2>x</T2> standards on replacement of existing steam generating unitsis considered minimal because of the small cost of the PM/NO<T2>x</T2> standards on new units.  As to the second question, EPA's analysis of the ``new boiler survey''results confirms the need for PM/NO<T2>x</T2> controls. It may well be true, as the petitioner contends, thatPM and NO<T2>x</T2> emission rates for individual new units will be lower, evenabsent an NSPS, than for existing units of equal size and fuel use patterns.However, the level of reductions from individual units that would occurin the absence of an NSPS is less than the emission reductions resultingfrom the promulgated standards.  The argument that NSPS-induced delays in steam generating unit replacementwill result in higher aggregate emissions is not supported by analysis.(See Docket A-83-27, Docket Item IV-A-4.) Based on unit replacement datafrom the ``new boiler survey'' and the PM and NO<T2>x</T2> emission levels expected from existing and NSPS-controlled newsteam generating units, aggregate emissions from existing and new steamgenerating units at facilities covered by the survey will increase afterinstallation of new units even with the NSPS. For PM, the aggregate increasewas roughly 30 percent relative to the level occurring prior to new unitinstallation. For NO<T2>x</T2>, the aggregate emissions almost doubled. This result_higheraggregate emission despite lower emission rates from individual units_iscaused primarily by emission increases from new units installed for newapplications that substantially exceed the emission reductions from facilitieswhere replacements occurred. Adoption of less stringent emission controlrequirements for new units would result in even greater increases in aggregatePM and NO<T2>x</T2> emissions. As a result, promulgation of an NSPS with stringentemission limits is essential if aggregate emissions of PM and NO<T2>x</T2> are to be minimized.  E. IFCAM National Impacts Model  <ITAG tagnum="81">Validity of the Model  </ITAG><T3>Petitioner's Comment:</T3> CIBO claimed that the Industrial Fuel ChoiceAnalysis Model (IFCAM) EPA used to forecast industrial steam generatingunit sales has serious shortcomings. The model is based on historical datafrom a period of chaotic energy prices and large cost differentials betweenhigh cost fuels (such as natural gas and fuel oil) and low cost fuels (suchas coal and waste fuels). The petitioner stated that the previous behaviorof steam generating unit owners in conserving energy and switching fuelswould not be repeated today because of the large decline of natural gasand fuel oil prices relative to those for coal and waste fuels. Accordingto the petitioner, the IFCAM model must be revalidated using the steamgenerating unit sales results contained in the ``new boiler survey'' andenergy prices for the period in question, allowing for appropriate decisionlead times. The petitioner stated that the IFCAM model should not be usedfor regulatory analyses until this revalidation has been accomplished.If the IFCAM projections cannot be validated, the petitioner stated thatthey must be disregarded and new data developed.  <T3>Agency Reponse:</T3> The petitioner appears to misunderstand the designand operation of IFCAM. IFCAM is simply a ``least cost'' economic choicemodel designed to aid in examining the impact of alternate regulatory standardson new industrial steam generating units. Key economic parameters (suchas the estimated growth in national industrial energy demand and projectedprices for coal, oil, and natural gas) are inputs to the model and reflectprojected economic conditions in the future. For each alternate regulatorystandard, IFCAM uses the projected fuel prices and total industrial energydemand to evaluate steam production costs for new industrial units spanninga range of sizes, capacity factors, and fuels, and then selects the steamgenerating unit and fuel combination with the lowest after-tax costs overthe useful life of each unit. The results of these fuel choice selectionsfor each new steam generating unit are then added together to estimatethe total costs, emissions, and fuel use associated with the alternateregulatory standard. Consequently, the impacts of alternate regulatorystandards are projected by IFCAM based on the input values for projectedfuel prices, projected industrial energy demand, and specified regulatoryrequirements. The results obtained from IFCAM, therefore, are not basedon the ``past,'' but are based on projections of the ``future.''  <ITAG tagnum="85">III. Petitions Submitted Concerning the SO</ITAG><T2>2</T2> Standards  A. Legal Basis for Establishing the SO<T2>2</T2> Standards  <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Consistency of the SO</ITAG><T2>2</T2> Standards with Congressional Intent  <T3>Petitioner's Comment:</T3> CIBO supplemented its petition for reconsiderationwith contentions that the SO<T2>2</T2> standard is inconsistent with Congressional intent in enactingthe 1977 amendments to the CAA. The essence of CIBO's contentions is thatCongress enacted the section 111 percent reduction requirement to ensurethat new sources do not switch to natural gas to avoid the applicationof control technology. CIBO contends, however, that the percent reductionrequirement included in the SO<T2>2</T2> standard will encourage new sources to switch from coal to naturalgas. The result, therefore, is to circumvent the statute. (The Departmentof Commerce also submitted comments on this point.)  <T3>Agency Reponse:</T3> The petitioner's contentions that the SO<T2>2</T2> standard is inconsistent with Congressional intent are withoutmerit. The petitioner misinterprets section 111. Followed to their logicalconclusions, these contentions mean that the Agency should have eithernot adopted any percent reduction requirement at all, or adopted a percentreduction requirement that applied to all fuels (e.g., coal, oil, naturalgas, wood, etc.).  An SO<T2>2</T2> standard for fossil fuel-fired stationary sources without anypercent reduction requirement is inconsistent with the explicit languageof Section 111 as it was amended by Congress [see CAA 111(a), H.R. Rep.No. 95-294 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 188 (1977) ``Conference Report'' reprintedin ``Legislative History of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977'', Volume4, at 2655 ``Legislative History'']. If the Agency had adopted an SO<T2>2</T2> standard including only a mass emission limit, sources couldhave avoided the application of any control technology simply by burningoil or low sulfur coal.An SO<T2>2</T2> standard with a percent reduction requirement applied to allfuels, including fuels such as natural gas, very low sulfur oil, wood,etc., may also be inconsistent with the explicit language of section 111,which requires the Agency to consider costs. If the Agency had adoptedan SO<T2>2</T2> standard applying the percent reduction requirement to all fuels,unreasonably high costs would have been imposed on a number of new sourcesfiring fuels such as natural gas, very low sulfur oil, wood, etc.EPA reads the percent reduction requirement in section 111 as temperedby the requirement that technology be the ``best technological system ofcontinuous emission reduction which (taking into consideration the cost* * *) * * * has been adequately demonstrated.'' Thus, a percent reductionrequirement need not be applied to certain types or classes of sourcesif the impacts associated with imposing this requirement would be unreasonable.Consequently, the Agency made a thorough analysis of the potential impactsof imposing the percent reduction requirement on various types and classesof sources. Based on this analysis, the Agency included exemptions fromthe percent reduction requirement where the impacts of imposing this requirementwould have been unreasonable. The final SO<T2>2</T2> standard, therefore, is reasonable and this approach representsa reasonable way to harmonize the twin requirements of Section 111 to includepercent reduction requirements and to consider costs.Finally, even in the absence of the SO<T2>2</T2> standard, economic factors unrelated to the standards, suchas the relative price between coal, oil, and natural gas, are likely tohave more impact on the choice of fuel for a new industrial-commercial-institutionalsteam generating unit than the SO<T2>2</T2> standard.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Impacts of the SO</ITAG><T2>2</T2> Standard on the Natural Energy Policy<T3>Petitioner's Comment: </T3>CIBO claimed that the SO<T2>2</T2> standard is inconsistent with national energy policy in thatit fails to encourage the use of coal, threatens a balanced energy supply,and reduces the incentive for companies to develop clean coal technologies.(The Department of Energy and the Department of Commerce also submittedcomments on this point.)<T3>Agency Response: </T3>The petitioner's comments are a repetition ofcomments submitted to the Agency during the public comment period followingproposal of the SO<T2>2</T2> standards. At worst, as discussed in the ``Summary of RegulatoryAnalysis,'' the proposal notice (51 FR 22384), Volume 4 of the BackgroundInformation Document, and the promulgation notice (52 FR 47826), the SO<T2>2</T2> standard will have only a very small impact on the overall mixof fuels consumed to satisfy national energy demands. Thus, the standardwill not cause a significant change in national energy supplies nor willit threaten national energy security.To illustrate this fact, under the worst case scenario examined by theAgency, about 600 new coal-, oil- or gas-fired industrial-commercial-institutionalsteam generating units are projected to be sold over the 5-year periodbetween 1986 and 1990. These new units will result in total fuel consumptionof roughly 550 PJ/year (520 trillion Btu/year) in 1990. Even if all thisenergy consumption were satisfied by coal, it would represent less than3 percent of total United States coal consumption in 1986. Similarly, ifall this energy consumption were satisfied by oil or natural gas, it wouldrepresent less than 2 percent or 3 percent, respectively, of total oilor natural gas consumption in 1986.Not all this increased energy consumption in new industrial-commercial-institutionalsteam generating units, of course, will be satisfied by a single fuel,such as natural gas or oil. Furthermore, the Agency's projections of salesof new steam generating units are quite likely to be overestimated, asthe petitioner has pointed out. Consequently, the impact of the SO<T2>2</T2> standard on changes in the national energy mix of coal, oil,and natural gas will be even less significant than these figures mightindicate.The Agency acknowledges that some fuel switching to natural gas may occuras a result of the SO<T2>2</T2> standard. As discussed in Volume 4 of the Background InformationDocument and the promulgation notice (52 FR 47826), this fuel switching,however, will be small compared to the amount of fuel switching that islikely to occur as a result of the current low price of natural gas. Theimpact of the SO<T2>2</T2> standard on the difference in cost between firing coal or firingnatural gas in a new steam generating unit is small compared to the impactof current natural gas prices. Even in the absence of the SO<T2>2</T2> standard, with current low natural gas prices few new steamgenerating units are likely to select coal over natural gas.Finally, as also discussed in the proposal notice (51 FR 22384), Volume4 of the Background Information Document, and the promulgation notice,(52 FR 47826), in developing the SO<T2>2</T2> standard the Agency recognized that the standard and, in particular,the requirement to achieve a 90 percent reduction in SO<T2>2</T2> emissions, could hinder the development of some new clean coaltechnologies. The potential risk of failure that might be associated withusing a new technology to achieve such a high percent reduction requirementcould be sufficient in some cases to deter the use of that technology.Yet it is only through new technologies that better and less expensivemeans of controlling SO<T2>2</T2> emissions can be developed.Although development of new technologies should be encouraged, it is notreasonable to permit the use of new technologies if use of these technologieswould lead to SO<T2>2</T2> emissions grossly out of balance with what emissions would havebeen if a conventional technology had been used. Thus, to encourage thedevelopment of new technologies that show promise of achieving levels ofperformance comparable to those of existing technologies, but ensure thatSO<T2>2</T2> emissions are not grossly out of balance with what they wouldhave been if a conventional technology had been used, provisions were includedin the SO<T2>2</T2> standard that require a 50 percent reduction in SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from new technologies and limit SO<T2>2</T2> emissions to 260 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.6 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu). This percent reduction requirement is low enoughto substantially reduce the risk of failure associated with achieving it,and the 260 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.6 lb SO<T2>2</T2> million Btu) emission limit ensures that SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from a source using a new technology will not be grosslyout of balance with what SO<T2>2</T2> emissions would have been if a conventional technology had beenused.B. Projected Economic Impacts<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Cost Effectiveness of a 130 ng SO</ITAG><T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) Heat Input Emission Limit on Electric Utility AuxiliarySteam Generating Units at the Zimmer Owners' Generating Station<T3>Petitioner's Comment: </T3>The Zimmer owners stated that EPA did notconsider the full costs associated with meeting a 130 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) heat input emission limit for its two very lowcapacity factor auxiliary utility steam generating units. The petitionerstated that the exemption from the percent reduction requirement for oil-firedunits with a maximum annual heat input capacity of 30 percent and lesswas meaningless when their very low capacity auxiliary units must alsomeet the 130 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) heat input emission limit.The petitioner contended that the full costs of meeting a 130 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) heat input standard at its two auxiliary unitsare grossly disproportionate to the benefits achieved [i.e., Mg (tons)of SO<T2>2</T2> removed]. For these units, either very low sulfur oil must beburned in both the main unit and the auxiliary units or a separate oilhandling system must be installed for the auxiliary units. According tothe petitioner, the separate handling system would cost a total of $225,000/year,or $13,000/Mg ($11,800/ton) of SO<T2>2</T2> removed, whereas burning very low sulfur oil in both the mainunit and auxiliary units would cost a total of $190,000/year, or $11,000/Mg($10,000/ton) of SO<T2>2</T2> removed. As a result of these unreasonable cost impacts, thepetitioner recommended that very low capacity factor auxiliary units beexcluded altogether from regulation under Subpart Db standards.<T3>Agency Response: </T3>The 130 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) heat input emission limit for steam generatingunits exempt from the percent reduction requirement was established basedon an assessment of the emissions and costs of very low sulfur oils. Inestablishing an NSPS, the Agency determines the best technology available,considering costs and other factors, for the category of sources affectedby the standard. This approach does not mean that every source affectedby the standards will incur the same costs of compliance. Some individualfacilities subject to the standards may experience higher cost. In otherwords, in setting standards for new sources the Agency takes costs intoaccount for the category of sources considered as a whole, not cost forevery particular facility that might be affected.Nevertheless, EPA reexamined the cost effectiveness of the promulgatedSO<T2>2</T2> standard based on the Zimmer owners' specific situation andconcluded that even in their situation the costs are reasonable.Of the two compliance alternatives identified by the Zimmer owners, thelower cost alternative is to use very low sulfur oil in both the main steamgenerating unit [which is permitted to fire oil with an emission potentialof 240 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.55 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu)] and the auxiliary units, which are subject tothese standards. Based on the projected emission reductions from only theauxiliary units [estimated at 17 Mg/year (19 tons/year)], the petitionerestimated that the cost effectiveness of SO<T2>2</T2> reductions would be $11,000/Mg ($10,000/ton). However, it isinappropriate to exclude the emission benefits of using very low sulfuroil in the main units. When these emission reductions are included, thecost-effectiveness level is roughly $3,700/Mg ($3,400/ton) of SO<T2>2</T2>, which is considered reasonable.Further, these calculations are based on a fuel premium that the Zimmerowners believe may exist between 130 and 240 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 and 0.55 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) oil of six cents per gallon. Based on a reviewof available data on fuel sulfur price premiums in the areas surroundingthe Zimmer station, this premium appears overstated. In fact, this reviewidentified little, if any, premium in the price between 130 and 240 ngSO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 and 0.55 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) oils. As a result, the actual cost-effectivenesslevel could be considerably lower than the value calculated above.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Exemption for Noncontinental Areas</ITAG><T3>Petitioner's Comment: </T3>CIBO contended that the exemption of industrialsteam generating units from the 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> reduction requirement in noncontinental areas was arbitrary.According to the petitioner, the Agency provided this limited exemptiondue to the unavailability of natural gas in noncontinental areas. The petitionerargued that the distinction between facilities in continental and noncontinentalareas is not supportable, considering that steam generating unit ownersin some areas of the continental United States also have difficulties inobtaining natural gas.<T3>Agency Response: </T3>The petitioner's contention is a moot point.Little or no coal is burned in steam generating units loaded in noncontinentalareas. Thus, the exemption for noncontinental areas in the final rule appliesin practice only to steam generating units burning very low sulfur oil.The final standard, however, also exempts all steam generating units firingvery low sulfur oil from the percent reduction requirement no matter wherethey are located. In effect, therefore, the exemption sought by CIBO hasalready been granted in the existing rule. To extend this exemption foroil-fired units to coal-fired units in the continental United States, wouldpresent statutory difficulties. Congress plainly intended that the Agencyutilize percentage reduction standards where appropriate given other statutoryconstraints, including the obligation to consider costs and other environmentalimpacts.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Failure to Analyze Economic Impacts on the Paper Industry</ITAG><T3>Petitioner's Comment: </T3>API/NFPA stated that, when compared to theseven other major steam-using industry groups examined in the ``Summaryof Regulatory Analysis,'' the paper industry ranked first in industrialsteam generating unit fossil fuel consumption. However, EPA performed economicimpact analyses for only six of these industries, omitting an analysisof the paper industry. According to the petitioner, such an analysis ofthe paper industry would have revealed important information about theimpact of the standard on the paper industry.<T3>Agency Response: </T3>The economic impacts analysis of NSPS for industrialsteam generating units was conducted in two phases. The first phase focusedon major steam-using industries. Using aggregate economic criteria to characterizeeach industry selected for analysis, this phase of the analysis examinedthe potential impact of NSPS on industry average steam costs and productprices, and the ability of the industry to pass increased costs forwardto the consumer or to absorb increased costs due to high profitability.The second phase of the analysis focused on selected industries consideredlikely to experience the most severe economic impacts. Industries wereselected for this phase of the analysis based on several crtieria: (1)Results from the first phase of the analysis indicated further analysiswas appropriate; (2) manufacturing operations within an industry were consideredunusually steam-intensive; or (3) the steam generating unit capacity withinan industry was characterized by unusually low utilization factors. Usingmodel plants and model firms representative of those found within eachindustry selected for analysis, this phase of the analysis examined thepotential impacts of NSPS on product prices and profitability at the plantlevel and capital availability at the firm level.The pulp and paper industry was one of the industries examined in the firstphase of this analysis. The results, however, indicated that the potentialimpacts of NSPS on this industry were small and that further analysis ofthis industry was not warranted in the second phase of this analysis. Althougha major steam consuming industry, most of the steam used in the pulp andpaper industry for pulping, bleaching, and paper making is generated byburning fuels, such as black liquor and wood, which are not subject tothe SO<T2>2</T2> standards. Combustion of oil and coal in the pulp and paperindustry may contribute less than one-third of the total steam requirementsfor this industry. Therefore, the potential impact of the NSPS on steamcosts and product prices is small.In addition, the first phase of the analysis also indicated that the pulpand paper industry was quite profitable. Pulp, paper, and board were producedat record levels in 1984, 1985, and 1986. The rates of after-tax profiton stockholders equity, the rates of after-tax profit on total assets,and the after-tax profits per dollar of sales were near or exceeded theaverage for all manufacturing plants in 1984, 1985, and 1986.As a result, the pulp and paper industry was not considered one of thoseindustries likely to experience the most severe economic impacts and, therefore,this industry was not examined in the second phase of the analysis. Inany case, the petitioner gave no indication of how such an analysis wouldchange the outcome of the standard. Consequently, the Agency finds no basisfor reconsidering the standards.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Inadequate Analysis of the Economic Impact of Start-Up, Shutdown,and Malfunction Provisions </ITAG><T3>Petitioner's Comment:</T3> API/NFPS also contended that start-up, shutdown,and malfunction provisions are needed for the standards because methodsof compliance with the standards during these periods are not always availableor are too expensive for many new paper industry facilities. The petitionercontended that EPA had abandoned its earlier position that emissions duringperiods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction would be minimized by relyingon spare capacity. The petitioner added that the Agency now relies on theability of units to switch to very low sulfur oil or natural gas duringsuch periods. The petitioner stated that many paper mills cannot obtain natural gas andthat 0.3 weight percent sulfur oil is not readily available in many areasof the country, particularly in noncoastal areas. The petitioner contendedthat the lack of natural gas in the noncontinental United States was specificallyrecognized in the regulations by providing an exemption from the percentreduction requirement for facilities in these locations, but that the regulationsdiscriminate for no valid reason against continental facilities that cannotobtain gas or very low sulfur fuel. According to the petitioner, many paper mills with access to natural gaswould also incur costs for backup supplies of natural gas in excess ofEPA assumptions because the gas costs that were assumed when developingthe regulations did not take into account demand charges and premium pricesfor firm gas supplies. Many paper mills would also incur excessive costsfor backup supplies of very low sulfur fuel oil. The petitioner estimatedthat the cost effectiveness of SO<T2>2</T2> removal when using noninterruptible natural gas or very lowsulfur oil as a malfunction backup fuel can be as high as $17,300/Mg ($15,700/ton),a ratio almost ten times more than estimated when developing the regulations.<T3>Agency Response:</T3> The decision to limit SO<T2>2</T2> emissions during periods of start-up, shutdown, and malfunctionwas based on the availability of several cost-effective alternatives thatan affected facility can use during these periods. Contrary to the petitioner'sassertion, using spare FGD capacity was not abandoned as a backup alternativeand is the most economically attractive option in many situations. It istrue that natural gas is not available everywhere. Similarly, very lowsulfur residual oil may be difficult to obtain in noncoastal locations,although very low sulfur distillate oil is generally available throughoutthe United States. If neither of these fuels is available at a specificlocation, alternatives such as liquid petroleum gas (LPG) or spare FGDmodules could be considered. Each alternative need not be available atevery potential location of a new facility. The costs of spare FGD capacity, natural gas, and very low sulfur oil wereanalyzed prior to promulgation of the standards. These costs were reexaminedbased on the petitioner's comments. In addition, use of LPG was also examined.When demand charges cited by the petitioner of $6.60 to $11.40/trillionJ/day/month ($7 to $12/million Btu/day/month) are assumed for noninterruptiblenatural gas, the cost effectiveness of this option ranges from $3,800 to$11,500/Mg ($3,500 and $10,500/ton). The cost effectiveness of all of theother options, however, such as natural gas (which does not carry suchhigh demand charges), very low sulfur oil, LPG, or spare FGD capacity,remains in the range of $550 to $4,400/Mg ($500 to $4,000/ton) of SO<T2>2</T2> removed and is considered reasonable. In addition, most steam using plants operate several steam generating unitsat less than full capacity so that if one unit malfunctions, the load canbe switched from one unit to another. According to data collected in the``new boiler survey,'' over 90 percent (i.e., 85 out of 92) of the newcoal- or oil-fired units sold between 1981 and 1984 were installed at plantswith multiple steam generating units. Because of the availability of backupsteam generating capacity, most plants should be able to shift steam productionto another unit during periods of FGD malfunction. In view of this variety of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction complianceoptions, individual plants will be able to economically control SO<T2>2</T2> emissions during these periods. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Legal Requirement for Consideration of Start-up, Shutdown, andMalfunction Costs </ITAG><T3>Petitioner's Comment:</T3> API/NFPA further contended that the courtsrequire consideration of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction costs, citing<T3>National Lime Association v. EPA, </T3>627 F.2d 416 (DC Circuit 1980)(referred to hereinafter as <T3>National Lime</T3>). According to the petitioner, the costs of complyingwith the standards during periods of start-up, shutdown, and malfunctionare unreasonably high and could be avoided with a provision for a temporaryvariance during start-up, shutdown, and malfunction conditions. <T3>Agency Response: National Lime</T3> does not require special start-up,shutdown, or malfunction provisions. Rather than specifying a particularrequirement or type of analysis to be undertaken, the court in <T3>National Lime</T3> required only that consideration be given to theachievability of the standards under the anticipated range of operatingvariables. The petitioner correctly pointed out that analysis of the achievabilityof standards under the likely range of conditions should include an assessmentof the cost of compliance associated with start-up, shutdown, and malfunctionof FGD equipment. As discussed above, the costs of several different start-up,shutdown, and malfunction alternatives were analyzed. The results of thisanalysis indicate that the impacts associated with limiting emissions duringstart-up, shutdown, and malfunction are reasonable. Thus, it is clear thatthe Agency's analysis in adopting the standards is consistent with <T3>National Lime.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Availability of 130 ng SO</ITAG><T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) Oil in Hawaii\4\ <T3>Petitioner's Comment:</T3> HECO<NOTE/> stated that the unique fuel supply and electric generationsituation in Hawaii was not considered in establishing the 130 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) emission limit. HECO contended that EPA shouldbroaden the exemption to allow sources on Oahu to burn oil with a sulfurcontent of 0.5 weight percent or less, which HECO currently is requiredby local regulations to fire on Oahu. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\Following the submittal of its Petition for Reconsiderationin March, HECO offered to provide additional information concerning oilshipments and oil consumption on the Hawaiian Islands to support its contentionthat oil containing less than 0.3 weight percent sulfur was unavailablein Hawaii. No such data were forthcoming until December 19, 1988, some9 months after submittal of the Petition for Reconsideration. The datacovered the 1984-1987 time period, and much of this information could havebeen submitted during the comment period following proposal of the rulein June 1986, and certainly the information could have been submitted withthe Petition for Reconsideration. HECO never advised the Agency that itwas having difficulty obtaining the data or that it actually intended tosupplement its petition. The Agency has no obligation to delay action onthe Petitions for Reconsideration pending submittal, however belated, ofinformation from petitioners or others. Nevertheless, the responses setforth below do address information presented in HECO's December 19, 1988,submittal. The two refineries located on the island of Oahu purchase crude oils withlow sulfur contents that, when blended, produce low sulfur residual oilwith 0.5 weight percent sulfur or less. These refineries cannot supplyall of HECO's needs, however, and approximately 3 million barrels of lowsulfur residual oil are imported by HECO from the West Coast of the UnitedStates, Singapore, and other worldwide sources. Meeting a sulfur specification of 0.5 weight percent permits HECO and thetwo refineries on Oahu to keep costs down and allows HECO to purchase lowsulfur residual oil that is competitive with low sulfur residual oil inthe continental United States. Having to purchase low sulfur residual oilwith a sulfur content of less than 0.3 weight percent would increase HECO'scosts. Besides the premium for this oil, there would be additional costsfor segregated storage, and the benefits would not be worth the costs.As a result, the promulgated standards would effectively preclude new SubpartDb steam generating units on Oahu. <T3>Agency Response: </T3>HECO argues, in effect, that the exemption fromthe 90 percent reduction requirement included in the final standard forsteam, generating units firing very low sulfur oil should be increasedfrom 130 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) to 240 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.50 lb/million Btu) since firing oil containing less than130 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) will increase HECO's costs. The mere fact thatcomplying with this exemption from the percent reduction requirement willitself result in some increase in costs, if HECO decides to take advantageof the exemption, is not a sufficient basis for reconsidering the exemption.This exemption was not included in the standard to provide a convenientmeans for sources to avoid the percent reduction requirement or for sourcesto avoid experiencing any increase in costs in complying with the standard.The exemption from the percent reduction requirement included in the standardfor steam generating units firing oils of less than 130 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) was based on a broad weighing of the relative costsand benefits of percent reduction requirements compared to firing oilsof various sulfur contents. The costs of complying with the standard willvary somewhat from location to location, and at any specific location willdepend on factors, such as local fuel prices, which are unique to thatlocation. Not every steam generating unit, therefore, will find it advantageousto comply with the standard in exactly the same way. Some units may findit advantageous to comply with the standard by meeting the percent reductionrequirement, others may find it advantageous to comply with the standardby firing very low sulfur oils. In short, not every steam generating unitsubject to the standard will experience the same costs, nor is there anyrequirement in section 111 of the CAA that the Agency tailor the standardin such a way that no source will experience higher costs than any othersource. In the original rulemaking, the Agency examined a broad range of costsassociated with the standard. (See e.g., ``Summary of Regulatory Analysis.'')HECO's contention that it will experience increased costs, or for thatmatter even that it may experience higher than average costs, in complyingwith the standard (or exemptions from the standard) would not have changedthe outcome of the rule and, therefore, does not compel reconsideration.Despite this finding, however, the Agency is unaware of why any HECO facilitywould be unable to take advantage of the exemption from the percent reductionrequirement for steam generating units firing oils of less than 130 ngSO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) if it chose to, nor does HECO suggest otherwise.First, Hawaii's access to very low sulfur oil may well be equal to or superiorto that of many areas of the continental United States, with its accessto waterborne shipments of very low sulfur fuel oils from Indonesia andCalifornia, two of the largest markets of very low sulfur residual oilin the world. Second, available data from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for theyears 1985 and 1986 (Docket No. A-83-27, Docket Items IV-I-3, IV-I-5, IV-I-6and IV-I-7) indicate that about 10 to 20 percent of the residual oil usedby HECO in 1985 and 1986 was 0.3 weight percent sulfur (or less) with thebalance being between 0.3 and 0.5 weight percent sulfur. Additional dataindicate a significant percentage of the residual oil imported into Hawaii(i.e., from outside the United States) was less than 0.3 weight percentsulfur: 7 percent in 1985; 15 percent in 1986; and 85 percent in 1987.Furthermore, as HECO points out in its supplement, it currently importsoil from the West Coast of the United States and Singapore. Based on reviewof DOE data for 1987 (Docket A-83-27, Docket Item VI-B-9), supplies ofresidual oil containing less than 0.3 weight percent sulfur are currentlyavailable in California. These residual oils are refined from Indonesianand Australian crude oils and could be shipped to Hawaii. Handling requirementsfor these 0.3 weight percent sulfur residual oils are similar to thosefor higher sulfur content residual oils.This indicates that residual oil with less than 0.3 weight percent sulfuris available in Hawaii, has been used by HECO in the past, and is availablefor import to Hawaii. Third, the possible need for new handling facilities does not distinguishHECO from other steam generating unit owners and operators. In Hawaii,as elsewhere in the United States, depending on the type of oil purchased(a matter under the owner or operator's control), the use of very low sulfuroil may require installation of dedicated oil handling and storage facilitiesalongside of, or in place of, facilities handling higher sulfur contentoil. Finally, HECO claims that the increase in costs associated with complyingwith the exemption from the percent reduction requirement might resultin ``precluding'' the use of new steam generating units on Oahu. HECO,however, does not explain its reasoning for this claim. HECO may mean,as it suggests with respect to the outer islands, that sources may constructdiesel engines rather than steam generating units. This decision is forthe source operator to make. The possibility that sources may constructdiesel engines rather than steam generating units is not, however, a basisfor modifying the standard. For all of these reasons, an increase in the sulfur content of the oilexempted from the percent reduction requirement is not warranted for Hawaii.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Need for New Oil Transportation System in Hawaii</ITAG><T3>Petitioner's Comment:</T3> HECO also stated that, in order for neighboringislands (Maui, Kauai, Molokai, Lanai, and Hawaii) to use very low sulfurresidual fuel oil a new inter-island transportation system (including vesselsand delivery, receiving, and storage capacity) would have to be developed.Currently, all of the oil fired on these islands is imported in bargesor tankers. Steam generating units on the neighboring islands fire oilwith a sulfur content of 2 weight percent or less, which does not requirea heated storage or distribution system. Importing waxy, very low sulfurresidual oil would require heated barges for inter-island transport anda heated storage and distribution system on the islands. Coast Guard regulationsprohibit hearing of the barges used for inter-island transport, and constructinga heated storage and distribution system would be uneconomical. HECO contended,therefore, that the Agency should exempt the Hawaiian outer islands fromthe SO<T2>2</T2> standards all together or permit the use of medium sulfur (2weight percent) oil.<T3>Agency Response:</T3> The nature of the inter-island transportationsystem in Hawaii does not warrant a special exemption for the outer islands.Residual oil capable of meeting an SO<T2>2</T2> emission limit of 130 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) could be obtained by HECO, as discussed above.Based on information received from the Hawaiian Department of Energy (DocketNo. A-83-27, Docket Item VI-E-9), the current method for transporting residualoil between the neighboring islands of Hawaii is by barge. This same systemcould be used to transport very low sulfur oil among the islands if slightmodifications were made. These modifications could include cleaning someof the barges, dedicating them to the transport of very low sulfur oil,and equipping new steam generating units with new or converted storagetanks dedicated to the storage of very low sulfur oil.Barge transport of fuel oil, far from being unique to Hawaii, is commonpractice throughout the continental United States. The Coast Guard doesnot prohibit the heating of barges transporting oil; it does have specificbarge and heating system design requirements to ensure that oil is safelyshipped (Docket A-83-27, Docket Item IV-E-10).Depending on the type of oil purchased, a matter entirely under HECO'scontrol, use of very low sulfur residual oil may require construction ofa heated storage and distribution system. The need for this type of system,however, would be no different for a new steam generating unit locatedin Hawaii than for a similar unit located in the continental United States.Therefore, an exemption from the standard for steam generating units locatedon the outer islands or an increase from 130 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) to 867 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (2.0 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) in the sulfur content of the oil exempted fromthe percent reduction requirement for the outer islands based on the needto make changes to the existing inter-island transport system or the costof constructing a heated storage and distribution system is unwarranted.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Increased Use of Large Steam Generating Units or Gas Turbine Generatorsin Hawaii</ITAG><T3>Petitioner's Comment:</T3> HECO further stated that if it is requiredto comply with the 130 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) SO<T2>2</T2> limitation, it would install gas turbine generators or electricutility steam generating units with heat inputs greater than 73 MW (250million Btu/hour) rather than Subpart Db units. According to the petitioner,such large utility steam generating units and gas turbine generators couldcomply with Subparts Da or GG by using the 0.5 weight percent sulfur residualoil available on Oahu.<T3>Agency Response:</T3> Subpart Db applies to steam generating unitswith a heat input capacity greater than 29 MW (100 million Btu/hour), exceptfor electric utility steam generating units covered by Subpart Da. Indeed,the petitioner could install electric utility steam generating units inexcess of 73 MW (250 million Btu/hour) heat input or a gas turbine generatorand be subject to Subpart Da or GG, respectively, rather than Subpart Db.Large electric utility steam generating units or gas turbine generatorscan comply with the SO<T2>2</T2> requirements of Subparts Da or GG by firing 0.5 weight percentsulfur oil.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Economic Impacts of Firing Low Sulfur Oil in the Hawaiian OuterIslands</ITAG><T3>Petitioner's Comment:</T3> HECO noted that the cost differential betweendistillate oil and residual oil makes the use of distillate oil in steamgenerating units impracticable on the outer islands compared to dieselengines. The result, according to HECO, is that no one will build steamgenerating units; rather, they will burn distillate oil in more efficientdiesel engines.<T3>Agency Response:</T3> The SO<T2>2</T2> standards merely limit the sulfur content of oil that may befired without meeting the 90 percent reduction requirement. The standardsdo not require new steam generating units taking advantage of this exemptionto fire distillate oil, but permit new steam generating units to fire anytype of oil. That HECO might find it more economical to make use of dieselengines to produce electricity does not make the standard unreasonable.As stated earlier, the Agency believes that residual oil containing lessthan 130 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.30 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) is available and can be supplied to steam generatingunits in Hawaii. HECO, however, always has the option of using distillateoil, residual oil, or even crude oil, or of switching between these fuels,based on its own assessment of fuel costs, supply uncertainties, and otherfactors. Furthermore, if transportation costs or use of very low sulfurcontent oil in the Hawaiian Islands becomes too expensive, HECO may wishto consider partial scrubbing of higher sulfur content oil to achieve the130 ng/J (0.30 lb/SO<T2>2</T2> million Btu) emission limit.B. Post-Proposal Developments<ITAG tagnum="81">1. New Docket Material</ITAG><T3>Petitioner's Comment:</T3> CIBO contended that EPA introduced new materialinto the docket and conducted new analyses of existing data after the closeof the public comment period, and that the public was not given sufficientopportunity to comment on this new material.<T3>Agency Response:</T3> In the proposed SO<T2>2</T2> rulemaking of June 19, 1986, EPA stated that the energy pricescenarios would be updated between proposal and promulgation to determinewhether the costs, emission reductions, or cost effectiveness of the rulewould be altered significantly, and, when completed, this information wouldbe added to the docket. (See 51 FR 22387.)On April 27, 1987, and again on October 30, 1987, a notice of documentavailability was sent to parties who commented on the June 19, 1986, proposedrulemaking, informing them that new materials and analyses were being addedto the docket. These notices included a listing of more than two dozennew reports related to the rulemaking, which can be found in Docket No.A-83-27. Copies of four of the reports, including the results of the ``newboiler survey,'' were attached to the April notice and six were attachedto the October notice.None of the petitioners commented on these new materials nor did they submitany additional information. Further, the new analyses showed no significantdifferences from the analyses that led to the development of the proposedstandard and reaffirmed the reasonableness of the final standard.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Analysis of the ``New Boiler Survey''  </ITAG><T3>Petitioner's Comment: </T3>CIBO objected to a question in the ``newboiler survey'' which asked, ``Would your decision to build a new boilerchange if projected costs to produce steam increased by: 10, 20, 30, or50 percent?'' The petitioner contended that this question was misleadingbecause it failed to reveal the source of the increased cost of meetingthe 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> emission reduction requirement. The petitioner also contendedthat the question failed to address costs, other than incremental steamcost, that would affect project viability. The petitioner suggested thatthe question be rephrased to ask, ``Would your decision to install a coal-or oil-fired boiler change if such boiler were subject to a requirement(1) that 90 percent of potential SO<T2>2</T2> emissions be removed on a continuous 30-day average basis (includingstart-up and shutdown periods), and (2) that the installation of low sulfurfuel-firing capability might need to be installed for periods of FGD systemmalfunction?''  <T3>Agency Response: </T3>The purpose of the ``new boiler survey'' wasto determine to what extent new steam generating units may be replacementsfor existing units and what impact this may have on overall SO<T2>2</T2> emissions. Thus, the survey focused on the reasons motivatingthe installation of new units, the disposition of existing units that maybe replaced by new units, and the overall impact of the installation ofnew units on SO<T2>2</T2> emissions. The specific question on costs was included in thesurvey to gauge how sensitive decisions to install new units, includingthose units that may replace existing units, may be to potential increasesin costs. The petitioner hypothesized that the answers might have beendifferent if EPA had formulated its question to specify that increasedcosts resulted from pollution control. In determining the cost of steam,prudent business practices would be to include all the costs associatedwith steam production, including any costs associated with pollution controland steam supply reliability. It is the magnitude, not the origin, of coststhat is relevant to the elasticity of sales as a function of costs. Nodetails or data were provided to support CIBO's conjecture. Unsupportedconjecture is not an adequate basis for reconsidering a rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Reevaluation of SO</ITAG><T2>2</T2> Emission Reductions  <T3>Petitioner's Comment: </T3>CIBO also contended that EPA failed to reevaluateSO<T2>2</T2> emission reductions in light of the data received from the ``newboiler survey'' conducted after proposal of the standards. Specifically,the petitioner contended that the SO<T2>2</T2> emission rates used by EPA were too high and, as a result, SO<T2>2</T2> emission reductions were overestimated. The petitioner alsocontended that the overall emission rate gleaned from the survey demonstratesthat a 1,100 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (2.5 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) heat input baseline for new coal-fired steam generatingunits is unjustifiably high. The petitioner also contended that the surveydemonstrates that SO<T2>2</T2> emission rates for oil-fired units were overestimated. The petitionerstated that without an accurate estimate of emission reduction, EPA cannotfulfill its statutory obligation under the CAA to accurately determinethe cost of achieving the emission reductions that any particular standardwill impose.  <T3>Agency Response: </T3>The Agency did analyze the impacts of the SO<T2>2</T2> standards using SO<T2>2</T2> emission rates from the ``new boiler survey.'' In fact, forevery analysis of national impacts performed by EPA, both prior to andafter proposal of the standards, the Agency included regulatory altenrativesthat were essentially the same as the emission rate indicated by the surveyto represent baseline levels. Because the Agency analyzes the incrementalimpacts of each regulatory alternative over the next less stringent alternative,the designation of a particular emission level as ``baseline'' rather thana ``regulatory alternative'' has little practice effect. The incrementaldifferences will be the same in either case.  Each of the Agency's analyses included emission levels lower than 1,100ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (2.5 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) for coal-fired units and 1,300 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (3.0 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) for oil-fired units. For example, each analysisincluded an alternative based on an emission level of 520 ng SO<T2>2</T2> /J (1.2 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) and 340 ng SO<T2>2</T2>/J (0.8 lb SO<T2>2</T2>/million Btu) for coal- and oil-fired units, respectively. Theseemission levels are essentially the same as those the petitioner believescan be gleaned from the survey as representative of baseline emission levels. In each analysis, the impacts of the regulatory alternative eventuallypromulgated as the SO<T2>2</T2> standards were analyzed relative to less stringent alternatives,including an emission level essentially comparable to the ``revised baseline''level proposed by the petitioner. In each instance, the impacts of thepromulgated standards were reasonable compared to this ``revised baseline''level. Consequently, the Agency did analyze the impacts of the standardsin light of the results of the survey and found those impacts to be reasonable.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Information on Impacts of Waste Disposal  </ITAG><T3>Petitioner's Comment: </T3>CIBO argued that post-proposal informationshowed that significant waste disposal problems would be created by theSO<T2>2</T2> standards. It also argued that methods used in some areas fordisposing of sodium scrubber waste (i.e., deep well injection, use of lineddisposal sites) are not cost effective, making the use of coal-fired steamgenerating units impracticable.  <T3>Agency Response: </T3>Steam generating units generally do not operatein isolation from other industrial processes, but are most often part ofa larger industrial manufacturing plant that itself often produces substantialquantities of wastes requiring disposal. In addition, coal-fired steamgenerating units generate fly ash as well as liquid feedwater and steamsystem ``blow-down'' wastes, which also require disposal. Thus, use ofSO<T2>2</T2> control systems to reduce SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from steam generating units may increase the volumeof wastes to be disposed of, but generally does not create a new problem(i.e., a need to dispose of wastes where no such need existed before). In areas where disposal of waste streams from sodium FGD or any other FGDsystem is considered by the owner or operator of a new steam generatingunit covered by the NSPS to be too costly, the owner or operator couldselect an alternative approach to comply with the NSPS. As discussed throughoutvolume 4 of the ``Background Information Document,'' the ``SO<T2>2</T2> Control Technology Updates Report,'' and the ``Summary of RegulatoryAnalysis,'' the SO<T2>2</T2> standards are based on a wide variety of techniques for controllingor reducing SO<T2>2</T2> emissions. The types of waste produced by FGD systems are quitedifferent. As a result, a steam generating unit owner can select the FGDsystem best suited to local waste disposal requirements. Sodium FGD systems,for example, produce a liquid waste requiring disposal. Lime spray dryingsystems and FBC systems, on the other hand, produce a dry waste product.The cost impacts associated with each of these SO<T2>2</T2> control technologies, including the costs of waste disposal,are considered reasonable. Thus, one can minimize problems associated withincreased waste disposal by appropriate selection of the SO<T2>2</T2> control system. The NSPS does not create an insurmountable wastedisposal problem nor does it make the use of coal-fired steam generatingunits impractical. Finally, even though not a basis of the standard, ifthe steam generating unit owner or operator views the cost of these controltechniques as excessive, switching to an alternate fuel, such as naturalgas or very low sulfur oil, which imposes no additional waste disposalrequirements, is an option.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Ability of FBC and FGD Systems to Achieve 90 Percent SO</ITAG><T2>2</T2> Reduction  <T3>Petitioner's Comment: </T3>CIBO questioned the ability of FBC unitsto achieve 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> reduction, especially those units experiencing large load swings.In addition, the petitioner stated that new information on spray dryerFGD systems does not support the ability of this technology to meet the90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> reduction requirements. The petitioner claimed that EPA reliedon switching to natural gas, and that such reliance violated EPA's dutyto promulgate a standard that is achievable for coal- and oil-fired units.<T3>Agency Response: </T3>As discussed in Volume 4 of the ``BackgroundInformation Document,'' sufficient short-term performance test data existto demonstrate that FBC technology is capable of achieving 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> removal. Short-term data presented in the ``Summary of RegulatoryAnalysis'' show that several FBC units achieved 90 percent or greater SO<T2>2</T2> control during the test periods. Longer term data (30 days ormore) also demonstrate that FBC units care capable of achieving greaterthan 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> removal at high reliability levels. A 30-day test on a bubblingbed FBC unit burning high sulfur coal showed SO<T2>2</T2> removal efficiencies averaging 93.5 percent. A 30-day test conductedat another site showed an average SO<T2>2</T2> removal of 90 percent with greater than 99 percent reliability.During a 67-day period at this site, the FBC unit had a reliability of97 percent. In addition, vendors have consistently stated that FBC unitscan be designed to achieve 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> removal at high reliability levels. Based on these data, EPAbelieves that FBC has demonstrated the ability to meet the 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> reduction requirement in the promulgated standards.In response to the petitioner's comment regarding the ability of FBC unitsto respond to load swings, FBC technology is characterized by the largethermal mass of the bed, which in turn limits the ability of FBC unitsto adjust quickly to large variations in steam demand. This is a characteristicof FBC technology that is unrelated to SO<T2>2</T2> removal. As a result, the owner of a facility with rapidly changingsteam demands is likely to select a conventional steam generating unitand FGD system, rather than an FBC, due to this inherent characteristicof FBC technology, which limits its ability to respond to large load swings.The percent reduction and reliability of lime spray drying have also beendemonstrated, as discussed in Volume 4 of the ``Background InformationDocument'' and as documented in the ``Summary of Regulatory Analysis''and the ``SO<T2>2</T2> Control Technology Update Report.'' Although few long-term (30day and longer) data are available to demonstrate high SO<T2>2</T2> removal levels, short-term tests indicate that lime spray dryingsystems are capable of achieving percent reduction levels in excess of90 percent. Although most lime spray dryers today are operated at roughly70 percent reduction to comply with the lower percent reduction requirementsin Subpart Da and in State permits, there is no reason to believe limespray dryers cannot achieve 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> reduction while maintaining a high degree of reliability. Infact, those periods during which high removal levels have been achievedin percent reduction tests indicate that lime spray drying systems arecapable of achieving high percent reduction levels with high reliabilitylevels. In addition, as with FBC technology, a vendor has also stated thatlime spray dryer FGD systems can be designed to achieve 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> removal at high reliability levels (Docket No. A-83-27, DocketItem VI-D-5). For these reasons, EPA believes that lime spray drying hasdemonstrated the ability to meet the 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> reduction requirement in the promulgated standards. (See 52FR 47837.)In this connection, EPA stated in the promulgation preamble that one vendor'sguarantee that 95 percent reliability was achievable in industrial applicationswas ``consistent'' with the results of 2 years operation of a lime spraydrying system on a 132 MW (450 million Btu/hour) heat input coal-firedsteam generating unit. (See 52 FR 47837; see also Docket A-83-27, DocketItem IV-B-9.) This statement remains true. The distinctions noted by thepetitioner between this application and industrial applications regardingremoval rates and load levels do not invalidate the comparison. The lowerremoval rate does not mean that EPA is incorrect in judging that higherremoval rates can be achieved in industrial applications. Likewise, differencesin loads do not mean that EPA's judgment is mistaken that load changescan be managed. The Agency's use of the comparison was fair. The examplewas not used as direct proof of reliability. It served as a useful, butnot necessary, illustration that the vendor guarantee in question was realistic.Moreover, the Administrator's determination that the standard was reasonablewas not based on the assumption that fuel switching would occur.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Use of Vendor Statements to Support 90 Percent SO</ITAG><T2>2</T2> Reduction<T3>Petitioner's Comment:</T3> CIBO stated that informal vendor statementshad been used to support that assertion that lime spray dryers can achievea 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> reduction. The petitioner asserted that a vendor guarantee doesnot reflect ``adequately demonstrated'' performance because the standard``must be based on cost-effective technologies that can be successfullyand reliably used in operating installations.'' The petitioner also statedthat EPA did not provide notice of how much EPA relied on vendor guaranteesin finding that lime spray dryers are ``demonstrated.''<T3>Agency Response:</T3> Data, analysis, and engineering judgment wereused to establish the 90 percent SO<T2>2</T2> reduction standard. The vendor guarantee was used merely toconfirm the regulatory decision and not as the sole basis for the standard.The term ``adequately demonstrated'' does not mean ``successfully and reliablyused in operating installations.'' An ``achievable'' standard need notbe already routinely achieved in the industry. [See <T3>National Lime Association v. EPA,</T3> 627 F.2d 416 (1980); <T3>Sierra Club v. Costle,</T3> 657 F.2d 298 (1981); and <T3>Portland Cement Assn. v. Ruckelshaus,</T3> 486 F.2d 375 (1973).] Rather,to be achievable, the standard must be achievable under most adverse conditionsthat can reasonably be expected to occur. (See <T3>National Lime, supra.</T3>)The vendor in question is a leading spray dryer FGD manufacturer, havinginstalled over 50 percent of the existing units, and is a reliable andauthoritative source of information on dry FGD systems. The vendor's statementswere only used to support the data and engineering judgment that servedas the basis of the standards. CIBO's criticisms of such guarantees arenot ``centrally relevant'' to the outcome of rule. In fact, EPA's determinationthat the lime spray technology was ``demonstrated'' was based, in the proposalas in the final rule, on the data in the record and its judgment that highlevels of performance and reliability were achievable. The Agency notedthe availability of performance guarantees at the time of proposal onlyas additional support for, but not the basis of, its position. (See e.g.,BID, Volume 4.)<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Summary</ITAG>The issues raised in each petition and discussed in this notice were carefullyconsidered; however, only the issue concerning cost impacts of the NO<T2>x</T2> standard on very low capacity factor steam generating unitsprovides a basis for revising the promulgated standards.
