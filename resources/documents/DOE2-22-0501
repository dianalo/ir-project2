Thesubject is discussed uner the topic headings:- quantum mass shift ofa uniformly accelerated electron and its classical part, manifestationof the mass shift of an accelerated charge in pair production by an electricfield, mass shift as a global characteristic of the field distributionover invariant space-time regions, interpretation of the shift seen bya uniformly accelerated observer, topological properties of the massshift, finiteness of the change of the euclidean action and connectionwith a topological invariant, and the role of spin of the self-fieldof a charge.
