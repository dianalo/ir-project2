Introduction </ITAG>Linuron is the common name for 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methoxy-1-methylurea.Linuron is most commonly sold under the trade names Lorox, Linex, Afalon,and Sarclex. It is available as a wettable powder, a granular, and a flowableor soluble concentrate. Linuron was first registered as a pesticide in 1960. It is a substitutedurea herbicide used mainly for pre-emergence and, in some crops or sites,postemergence control of certain troublesome broadleafed weeds and annualgrasses on terrestrial food and non-food sites. Food sites include soybeans,field and sweet corn, cotton, sorghum, wheat and other small grains, asparagus,carrots, celery, parsnips, and potatoes. Non-food sites include alleys,fencerows, fairways, golf tees, highway rights-of-way, sodfields, streets,and vacant lots. Linuron has limited contact action and when it is usedpostemergence, it is normally applied with a surfactant. Linuron is oftenselected for use on light to medium soil types with low organic matter,especially in soybeans, because it is less phytotoxic than its major alternativeon those soils. In the United States, EPA estimates that 4.8 million to 6.2 million poundsactive ingredient are used per year. Approximately 84 percent, or approximately5.2 million pounds, of linuron used annually in the United States is usedon soybeans; the remaining 16 percent is applied to asparagus, carrots,celery, potatoes, parsnips, and other minor use sites including non-foodsiteslisted above. Its home garden and greenhouse uses account for less than1 percent of all linuron usage. E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Inc., Drexel Chemical Company, andGriffin Corporation produce the technical material. Fourteen registrantshold Federal registrations for approximately 30 pesticide products containinglinuron as an active ingredient. The Registration Standard for pesticide products containing linuron wasissued on June 29, 1984. The Agency reviewed information concerning thepotential adverse effects associated with uses of linuron which indicatedthat linuron induces dose-related tumors in rats and in mice. The RegistrationStandard required submission of product and residue chemistry, environmentalfate, toxicology, and wildlife data. Certain label restrictions were alsorequired including a tumor warning statement regarding linuron's oncogeniceffects, restricted use classification, and a requirement that protectiveclothing be worn during linuron application. On September 26, 1984, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a noticeof Special Review of Certain Pesticide Products for registrations of productscontaining linuron (49 FR 37843) which detailed the basis for the Agency'sdecision to initiate a Special Review. The Agency determined that pesticideproducts containing linuron met or exceeded the risk criterion in 40 CFR162.11(a)(3)(ii)(A). That section provided that a Special Review, previouslyknown as Rebuttable Presumption Against Registration (RPAR), should beconducted if the use of a pesticide ``induces oncogenic effects in experimentalmammalian species or in man as a result of oral, inhalation or dermal exposure* * *.'' The Special Review was initiated based on laboratory data which indicatedthat linuron induced statistically significant dose-related tumors in ratsand mice. Specifically, in a 2-year feeding study male rats developed interstitialcell testicular adenomas (benign tumors). In a 2-year mouse feeding study,a statistically significant increase in hepatocellular adenomas was observed.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Legal Background </ITAG>A. The Statute A pesticide product may be sold or distributed in the United States onlyif it is registered or exempt from registration under the Federal Insecticide,Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended (7 U.S.C. 136 <T3>et seq.</T3>). Before a product can be registered it must be shownthat it can be used without ``unreasonable adverse effects on the environment''(FIFRA section 3(c)(5)), that is, without causing ``any unreasonable riskto man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social, andenvironmental costs and benefits of the use of the pesticide'' (FIFRA section2(bb)). The burden of proving that a pesticide meets this standard forregistration is, at all times, on the proponent of initial or continuedregistration. If at any time the Agency determines that a pesticide nolonger meets this standard for registration, then the Administrator maycancel this registration under section 6 of FIFRA. B. The Special Review Process The Special Review process, formerly called the Rebuttable PresumptionAgainst Registration (RPAR) process, is a mechanism by which the Agencycollects information on the risks and benefits associated with the usesof pesticides to determine whether any use causes unreasonable adverseeffects to human health or the environment. The Special Review processis currently governed by 40 CFR Part 154. At the time of initiation ofthe linuron Special Review, the Special Review process was governed by40 CFR Part 162. Through the Special Review process the Agency: (1) Announces and describesthe Agency's risk concerns regarding pesticidal use based on certain riskcriteria, (2) establishes a public docket, (3) proposes a regulatory decision,(4) solicits comments from the public on the proposed decision and issuesconcerning the Special Review, (5) responds to significant comments fromthe Secretary of Agriculture and the Scientific Advisory Panel, and (6)makes a final regulatory decision based on a balancing of risks and benefitsassociated with a pesticide's use. Pursuant to 40 CFR 154.31, the Administrator is required to prepare a Noticeof Preliminary Determination after the close of the comment period on theNotice of Special Review. The Notice of Preliminary Determination mustrespond to comments submitted in response to the Notice of Special Review,and for each use of a pesticide product that was subject of the Noticeof Special Review shall include a determination whether the use satisfiesthe risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7. At the time of the initiationof the Special Review of linuron the risk criterion for oncogenic effectswas set forth at 40 CFR 162.11(a)(3)(ii)(A). After the close of the commentperiod on this Notice, the Agency will publish a Notice of Final Determination.Issuance of this Notice means that the Agency has assessed the potentialadverse effects associated with the use of linuron and preliminarily determinedthat the risk criterion for oncogenic effects set forth in 40 CFR 154.7(a)(2)has not been exceeded. Therefore, this Notice of Preliminary Determinationto conclude the Special Review of linuron is being issued pursuant to 40CFR 154.3. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Risk Determinations </ITAG>A. Basis for Special Review As noted in Unit I of this Notice, the Special Review of linuron was initiatedbecause of a study in rats and one in mice that indicated a dose-relatedtumor response. In the 2-year rat study, conducted at Haskell Laboratory(Kaplan, A.M. et al., 1980), researchers fed linuron to Charles River CD-1rats. A control group and 3 dose groups of 50, 125, and 625 parts per million(ppm) linuron were used. Each group contained 80 male and 80 female rats.Male rats developed interstitial cell testicular adenomas. Most of thetumors developed at the end of the study and were not regarded as life-threatening.Rat mortality was not dose-related. The frequency of testicular adenomasincreased with dose, and the increase in number was statistically significantwhen compared to the controls for the two highest dose groups. The incidenceof interstitial cell adenoma in the testes is noted in the following Table1: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s170,r150,16,12</C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>The Incidence of Testicular Adenomas in Male Rats Fed Linuron for TwoYears </T4><H1>Group </H1><H1>Dose </H1><H1>Number of animals with tumors/total number of animals </H1><H1>Percentage </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1.

Eight groups (four male and four female dose groups) of 80 miceeach were used in this study. Survival was similar in control and treatedgroups. Female mice developed a statistically significant increase in hepatocellularadenomas in the highest dose group, and male mice developed borderlinestatistically significant hepatocellular adenomas only in the lowest dosegroup. The incidence of hepatocellular adenoma in both sexes is noted inthe following Table 2: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s170,r150,16,12</C><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>The Incidence of Hepatocellular Adenomas in Male and Female Mice FedLinuron for Two Years </T4><H1>Group </H1><H1>Dose </H1><H1>Number of animals with tumors/total number of animals </H1><H1>Percentage </H1> Males:<ITAG tagnum="3">1.

These compound-relatedeffects included hepatocytomegaly, hepatocellular cytoplasmic alteration,hepatocellular vacuolization, hemorrhage, and necrosis. Due to the diversenature of the oncogenic response with respect to the dose (low dose, males;high dose, females), the presence of benign tumors with no progressiontoward malignancy, and the lack of a definite dose-response curve, thetumors seen in the 2-year mouse feeding study are considered to be a minimaltumorigenic response. Neither the liver tumors nor the other effects notedin this study were used by the Agency for quantitation of dietary risk.The 2-year rat study was used as the basis for calculating a preliminaryquantitative oncogenic risk assessment from dietary exposure for the generalpopulation and to farmers applying linuron to soybeans. In the Notice of Special Review, the Agency estimated dietary exposurefor three different exposure assumptions. The first estimate was basedon tolerances and it was assumed that residues were at 100 percent of theselevels and that 100 percent of the crop was treated. Based on actual residuelevels found in the field, the second estimate used the maximum residuesexpected and assumed 100 percent crop treated. The final estimate was basedon the maximum residues expected multiplied by an estimate of the percentcrop treated. The Agency believes the most realistic estimate of dietaryexposure was the third. Using the linearized multi-stage model to calculatea preliminary risk estimate for maximum expected residues and percent croptreated, upper-bound lifetime oncogenic dietary risk from exposure to linuronwas estimated to be 2andmultiply;10^5. This value represents a 95 percentprobability that the risks from dietary exposure are no greater than twopeople per 100,000 developing tumors from a lifetime dietary exposure.The lifetime dietary oncogenic risk ranged from 1andmultiply;10^3 to 2andmultiply;10^5for the three different dietary exposure assumptions. The Agency also evaluated potential occupational oncogenicity risk to farmersapplying linuron to soybeans under three different exposure assumptions.The first estimate represented maximum exposure because it assumed thefarmer was not wearing protective clothing. The second estimate assumedthe farmer was wearing protective clothing which reduced exposure 80 percent.It was also assumed that some pesticide filtered in around collar edges,cuffs, etc. The third estimate assumed the farmer was wearing protectiveclothing and exposure was reduced 100 percent for areas covered by protectiveclothing. However, exposure to unprotected areas was still assumed. Averagedaily dermal exposure for a farmer during ground application of linuronto soybeans was calculated to be 3andmultiply;10^3 milligrams/kilogram/day(mg/kg/day), 4andmultiply;10^4 mg/kg/day, and 8andmultiply;10^5 mg/kg/day foreach assumption, respectively. These estimates assumed that the farmermixed and loaded as well as applied linuron. The Agency believed the mostreasonable exposure would occur under the second exposure assumption, thatexposure was reduced 80 percent by protective clothing. Upper-bound estimatedlifetime oncogenic risk to a soybean farmer applying linuron was calculatedto be between 5andmultiply;10^5 (1 day per year) and 3andmultiply;10^4 (6 daysper year), or 5 to 30 people at risk per 100,000. This value representsa 95 percent likelihood that non-dietary risks are not greater than thoseestimated above. Oncogenic risk to farmers was calculated solely for dermalexposure absorption since it is the primary mode of exposure; 100 percentdermal absorption was assumed. In a recent report (May 1987), the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) estimatedthe oncogenic risks posed to consumers by pesticides. The NAS report estimatedthat linuron residues posed a 10^3 dietary risk to consumers. That estimatewas based on the assumptions that 100 percent of the crop was treated andthat residues were at tolerance limits (dietary exposure estimate 1 inthe Notice of Special Review), two assumptions which the Agency considersto be unrealistic. Use of assumptions the Agency believes are more realistic_maximumresidues expected times percent of crop treated (dietary exposure estimated3 in the Notice of Special Review)_would result in a decrease in the NASrisk estimate of approximately two orders of magnitude (i.e., risks inthe range of those presented in the Notice of special Review). However,for reasons discussed in Unit III.B.4 of this Notice, the Agency now believesthe evidence of linuron's carcinogenicity is weak enough that it does notsupport quantification of risk and that even the 10^5 risk estimate isan over-estimate of risk. B. Additional Information Subsequent to the Notice of Special Review, EPA received additional exposureand toxicity data. These data are discussed below.   1. <T3>Exposure Data</T3>_a. <T3>non-dietary exposure</T3>. Additional data include a worker exposurestudy (Guinivan, R.A., 1984), a dermal penetration study (Anderson, J.J.,1984), residue data for the major uses of linuron, and environmental fatedata.The worker exposure study showed that the combined annualized daily dermalexposure (for pre-emergence use only) was approximately 1andmultiply;10^3mg/kg/day. For both pre- and postemergence use, the combined dermal exposurewas estimated to be 2andmultiply;10^3 mg/kg/day. These exposure levels areapproximately equivalent to those calculated in the Notice of Special Reviewfor estimate 1 (no protective clothing assumed).After the Registration Standard was issued, Du Pont submitted a valid dermalpenetration study (Anderson, J.J., 1984). Results of the study indicatedthat only 1 to 2 percent of linuron penetrates the skin. For the applicatorrisk assessment in the Notice of Special Review, the Agency had assumed100 percent dermal penetration and a risk to mixer/loader/applicators inthe 10^4 range. One to 2 percent dermal penetration would significantlylower the internal absorbed dose and the estimated non-dietary risk by1 to 2 orders of magnitude. Thus, even if the Agency were to quantify applicatorrisk now, the risks (in the 10^5 to 10^6 range) would be considered acceptable.b. <T3>Dietary exposure</T3>_i. <T3>crop residues. </T3>Additional residue data for the major uses of linuronhave also been received from Du Pont in response to the Registration Standardand a Data Call In notice issued on May 19, 1986. Average residue levelsfor soybeans, the major crop use of linuron, were approximately 0.07 ppm,compared to a tolerance level of 1.0 ppm. These additional residue datashowed actual residue levels similar to those used for the dietary exposureestimates in the Notice of Special Review. Therefore, if EPA were to quantifydietary risk from the latest residue data submission, it is believed thatthe upper-bound lifetime risk would be no greater than 10^5 and possiblymuch lower. As noted previously, the risk estimate in the NAS report wasbased on residues that were at tolerance limits.ii. <T3>Drinking water residues</T3>. Although not a basis for Special Reviewand no exposure or risk estimates were calculated, the Agency did notein the Notice of Special Review that dietary exposure through water contaminationwas possible. Linuron run off into rivers and leaching to aquifers couldcontaminate drinking water which is drawn from either surface or groundwater. As stated in the Notice of Special Review, limited monitoring datafrom 1982 to 1984 in northwestern Ohio showed the presence of linuron atvery low levels (mean concentrations ranged from 0.00 to 7.16 parts perbillion (ppb)) in surface and tap water. Although the data showed thatlinuron was present in the surface water of northwestern Ohio, the datawere presumed to represent a worst case situation since use of pesticideson soybeans and corn in this area is considered to be extremely heavy.To evaluate the potential for linuron to contaminate drinking water, productchemistry and environmental fate studies were required on an expeditedbasis. Data were submitted by the registrant and have been reviewed bythe Agency. These data indicate that although the linuron parent compoundmoderately leaches, its mobility decreases as soil organic matter increases.However, the studies did not provide enough information to assess the abilityof linuron's soil degradation products to contaminate drinking water. DuPont was notified of the inadequacy and the Office of Pesticide Programsis currently reviewing information submitted by Du Pont which is intendedto clarify and supplement the original data submission.Linuron has been included in the Drinking Water Wells Survey being conductedby the Agency's Office of Drinking Water and Office of Pesticide Programs.Although not identified as a chemical thought to have a high risk potentialfor leaching into groundwater, linuron was included because it is detectableby the method used for testing well water. If levels are detected, a HealthAdvisory may be established and other regulatory measures may be considered.The need for additional ground water data will be determined after reviewingenvironmental data and/or the Drinking Water Wells Survey data.2. <T3>Toxicity Data.</T3> Additional toxicity data include a full batteryof mutagenicity data, a multi-generation rat reproduction study, a feedingstudy, and a set of studies investigating the mechanism of action of tumorformation.Du Pont submitted all required mutagenicity data representing the threegeneral categories of mutagenicity testing (i.e., gene mutations, structuralchromosomal aberrations, and direct DNA damage and repair). The Agencyhas reviewed the mutagenicity studies submitted by Du Pont and concludedthat linuron is not a mutagen. The data showed no evidence of adverse geneticor chromosomal effects in any study.A multi-generation rat reproduction study conducted by Du Pont was submittedin response to the Notice of Special Review and was reviewed by the Agency.Three successive generations of Charles River Crl:CD rats were fed dietarylinuron at 0, 25, 125 and 625 ppm. The incidence of testicular adenomain the F<T2>1b</T2> and F<T2>2b</T2> combined groups is noted in the following Table 3:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>3._<T4>The Incidence of Testicular Adenomas in </T4>F<T2>1b</T2> <T4>and </T4>F<T2>2b</T2> <T4>Male Rats</T4><H1>Group</H1><H1>Dose</H1><H1>Number of animals with tumors/Total number of animals</H1><H1>Percentage</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1.

Although it appears that reproductive effectsmay have been demonstrated (reduced fertility in generations F<T2>2A</T2>-F<T2>3A</T2>, decreased pup survival), the study was deficient. No histologicaldata were provided for the parental animals following their breeding orweaning of offspring. There were no gross pathology data available forthe animals which died during the study and no evaluation of the possiblecauses of infertility was made. Though not intended to examine oncogeniceffects, this reproductive study demonstrates the oncogenic effects (testicularadenomas and hyperplasia) noted in earlier studies. The test animals weresacrificed late in their life cycle, most at 2 years of age, with the earliestat 480 days.In response to a Data Call In Notice issued to registrants on May 18, 1986,Du Pont submitted a feeding study which investigated the effects of linuronfed to aged male Charles River Crl:CD(SD)BR rats. At the beginning of thestudy, the average age of the rats was 12 months. The researchers exposedolder rats in the last year of life (12 months before 24 months sacrifice)to either: (1) No linuron, (2) no linuron for 6 months and then linuronfor 6 months, or (3) just linuron for 12 months. The incidence of hyperplasiaand adenoma of the testes in aged male rats is demonstrated in the followingTable 4:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,xs48,r120,r120,13,13</C><T4>Table </T4>4._<T4>The Incidence of Testicular Adenoma and Hyperplasia in Aged Male Rats</T4><H1>Group</H1><H1>Linuron exposure (ppm)</H1><H1>Period in life exposed</H1><H1>Response</H1><H2>Hyperplasia</H2><H2>Adenomas</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">1<D>0 ppm</D><D>None</D><D>8/25 (32%)</D><D>0/25  (0%)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2<D>0, then 625 ppm</D><D>18 to 24 mos</D><D>8/25 (32%)</D><D>2/25  (4%)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3<D>625 ppm, then 625 ppm</D><D>12 to 24 mos</D><D>15/25 (60%)</D><D>6/25 (24%)</D></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Rats which were fed a normal diet for 6 months followed by 6 monthsof 625 ppm dietary linuron (group 2), had a non-statistically significantincrease of testicular adenomas. A statistically significant increase intesticular adenomas and hyperplasia was observed in male rats fed dietarylinuron for 12 months (group 3). No malignant tumors were even observed.These results support the theory that the tumorigenic effects of exposureto linuron may be age-related-i.e., age-related alterations, perhaps ofa hormonal nature, may make the testicular tissue more susceptible to anoncogenic response.  After the initiation of the Special Review, du Pont also submitted a setof studies which they believed suggested that the mechanism of action oftumor formation is influenced through the pituitary-testes ``feedback loop'',in effect a threshold tumorigenic response. Specifically, du Pont believesthat the additional data demonstrate that the formation of testicular tumorsis regulated via alterations in responsiveness of the interstitial cellsof the testes to luteinizing hormone (LH_LH is a hormone released fromthe pituitary and is important in the regulation of the growth of testicularcells) resulting in testicular hyperplasia and adenomas.  Biochemical data submitted by du Pont examined the effects of linuron uponhorse testicular microsomes, testosterone clearance, and the ability ofLH to induce the secretion of testosterone in Leydig cells isolated <T3>in vitro</T3> from rats treated repeatably (200 mg/kg orally for 3_7days) or treated chronically (11 or 19 months at 0, 25, 125, or 625 ppm).After review by the Agency, data from the <T3>in vitro</T3> study were initially suggestive of a hyperactive responseof the chronically dosed rat (625 ppm) Leydig cells to LH. To clarify the registrant's proposed mechanism of action of linuron onthe hypothalamus-pituitary axis, researchers at EPA's Health Effects ResearchLaboratory in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, evaluated the hormonally-regulatedeffects of linuron upon testicular changes in Leydig cells. Using LE-hoodedmale rats, linuron was administered for 4 days (0, 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg/day)with a 3-day post-dosing period. There was no evidence that the compoundproduced a significant effect upon blood levels of LH, follicle-stimulatinghormone, or prolactin. After evaluating the data from du Pont and its own research laboratory,the Agency has concluded that there is no convincing evidence that theoncogenic effect of linuron is secondary to an alteration in the pituitary-testeshormonal ``feedback loop''. Although it is possible that linuron alterslevels of some testosterone-related enzymes and the responsiveness of thetestes to luteinizing hormone, additional data which explore blood hormonallevels are necessary to confirm or deny the existence of a secondary mechanismfor tumorigenicity.  Although not a basis for special review, EPA was aware of the potentialof linuron to cause adverse blood effects. In 1962, du Pont submitted a2-year dog feeding study (Hodge, H.C., 1962). Four groups of six beagledogs (three males and three females) were administered diets containing0, 25, 125, and 625 ppm for 2 years. These levels correspond to 0, 0.625,3.125, and 15.625 mg/kg/day. Analysis of blood revealed an abnormal bloodpigment (sulfhemoglobin) in dogs fed linuron down to the lowest dose tested,25 ppm. Thus, the lowest effect (LEL) for hematotoxicity was establishedat 25 ppm. (0.625 mg/kg/day). 3. <T3>Comments on the Notice of Special Review.</T3> During the offical commentperiod for the Notice of Special Review, the Agency only received commentsfrom E.I. du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co., Inc. Du Pont stated that ``thetoxicological concerns expressed relative to linuron (testicular adenomasoccurring in aged rats_not noted at 1-year interim sacrifice), if rankedin an accepted classification system of possible oncogens (i.e., Squiresor the system which we understand that EPA is presently considering), wouldrank in the weakest class.'' This comment is discussed in the next section. 4. <T3>Classification of the Oncogenic Potential of Linuron.</T3> Since theintitiation of the Special Review, EPA has established Guidelines for CarcinogenicRisk Assessment (51 FR 33992, 9/24/86). These guidelines assist Agencyscientists in assessing the potential for a chemical to cause cancer inhumans. The guidelines categorize the overall weight of evidence for humancarcinogenicity by: (1) Summarizing the weight of evidence in human and/oranimal studies, (2) utilizing this information to assign a tentative category,and (3) evaluating all relevant supportive information to determine ifmodifications in the weight of evidence are necessary. There are five categories of carcinogenicity. They are noted as Group A,B, C, D or E. Group A is used for those chemicals for which there is sufficientepidemiological evidence to support a causal association between humanexposure and cancer.  Group B, probable human carcinogens, includes those chemicals for whichthere is limited human evidence of cancer (B1) and those chemicals forwhich there is sufficient evidence of cancer in animals but inadequateor no data of human carcinogenicity (B2).  Group C, possible human carcinogens, is used to categorize chemical agentsfor which there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in animals and nohuman data. Within this category are chemicals with a wide range of humanoncogenic potential. In some cases, the available data demonstrate a reasonablepotential that the chemical is carcinogenic in humans but available datamay be limited to one species. In other cases, the data set may be largebut conflicting or equivocal. To distinguish those chemicals within thiscategory where the Agency believes more data are likely to support a findingof probable human carcinogenicity, the Agency elects to classify the chemicalsas Group C oncogens but to quantify their risks. Where the Agency believesthe link to human carcinogenicity is weak or insufficient and that thechemical should not be regulated as a human carcinogen, it chooses notto quantify the risks. The decision regarding the strength of the linkbetween animal and human carcinogenicity, has to be made on a case-by-casebasis. The thought process in determining whether the weight of evidencejustifies quantification of its risk as a Group C carcinogen, and thenwhether to quantify its carcinogenic risk, is basically the same. Bothdecisions reflect a qualitative scientific assessment of the data and thelikelihood that the effect seen in animals is indicative of human carcinogenicpotential.  Group D is reserved for chemicals where available data are insufficientto assess human carcinogenic potential. Group E includes agents that showno evidence of carcinogenicity in specified animal studies.  The Office of Pesticide Programs' Peer Review Group and the Agency's CarcinogenAssessment Group reviewed the weight of evidence to determine the oncogenicpotential of linuron. Both groups agree that linuron should be categorizedas a Group C chemical. This conclusion is based on the following: 1. Although linuron produced a statistically significant increase in bothtesticular hyperplasia and adenomas in male rats and a statistically significantincrease in the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas in female mice atthe highest dose group tested, the tumors observed were benign in natureand showed no progession toward malignancy. 2. The tumors found in the rat oncogenicity study occurred late in thelife of the test animals and were not life-threatening. 3. Linuron did not test positively in the standard battery of mutagenicitytests. 4. Historically, spontaneous formation of testicular adenomas, a relativelycommon type of tumor, has been observed in Charles River and Fischer ratstrains. (Carcinogen Assessment Group Memorandum, J. Holder to J. Rowe,6/2/87; Sher, S.P. et al., 1982; Huseby, R.A., 1981). The confluence of these factors_late-forming benign testicular tumors ofa relatively common tumor type in animals with a background rate of similartumors, and lack of supporting evidence of carcinogenic potential (e.g.,mutagenicity data)_all lead to a conclusion that the evidence in this caseof human carcinogenic potential is weak. Based on these factors, the Agency believes that quantification of cancerrisk, and thus consideration of carcinogenicity of linuron as the endpointof regulatory concern, is inappropriate because of linuron's low humancarcinogenic potential. On September 23, 1987, the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) met toreview a set of scientific issues supporting EPA's decision to classifylinuron as a Group C oncogen. The SAP was requested to comment on the Agency'sassessment of the weight-of-the-evidence and subsequent determination ofoncogenicity according to the Agency's Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment.The SAP agreed with the Agency's categorization of linuron as a Group Cchemical. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Preliminary Regulatory Decision </ITAG>As noted above, the Registration Standard and the Notice of Special Reviewfor linuron were issued in 1984, before publication of the Guidelines forCarcinogen Risk Assessment. Prior to issuance of the Guidelines, the Agencyroutinely quantified carcinogenic risk as a matter of policy of a dose-responserelationship was demonstrated. Thus, the oncogenic risk of linuron wasquantified for the Registration Standard and the Notice of Special Review.Since publication of the Risk Assessment Guidelines, EPA does not alwaysquantify carcinogenic risk for Group C chemicals but reviews each groupC chemical on a case by case basis. As discussed earlier, the Agency nolonger believes that linuron risk should be quantified or that linuronexceeds the oncogenicity risk criterion. The Agency has concluded that the available data no longer support a Specialreview for linuron. This determination was based not only on additionaltoxicological information but also upon actual crop residue data whichwere received after the notice of Special Review was issued. Although theAgency formerly believed that the Special Review risk criterion for oncogenicity(40 CFR 162.11(a)(3)(ii)(A)) had been exceeded and subsequently initateda Special Review, the Agency now believes the evidence supporting the carcinogenicityof linuron in humans is of a limited nature and that the human carcinogenicpotential resulting from exposure to linuron is low. Therefore, linuroncan no longer be considered to pose unreasonable risks due to oncogenicity.After concluding that the evidence supporting linuron's carcinogenicityin humans is not strong enough to support a Special Review of linuron,the Agency examined the other toxicological effect of possible concern,hematotoxicity. The Agency estimated the theoretical maximum residue concentration(TMRC), which is an estimation of the United States (U.S.) population'sdietary exposure to linuron. The TMRC was then compared to the provisionalacceptance daily intake (PADI), or the residue level conditionally thoughtto be toxicologically safe for daily consumption. The PADI is based onthe lowest effect level (LEL) for hematotoxicity, the next effect of toxicologicalconcern, which was established in the chronic dog feeding study with aLEL of 25 ppm (0.625 mg/kg of bodyweight), noted previously. Using a threehundredfold safety factor, the PADI is calculated to be 0.002 mg/kg/day.Using actual residue values and percent of crop treated figures, the TMRCfor the U.S. population was calculated to be 0.00005 mg/kg/day, equivalentto 2.5 percent of the PADI. The most highly exposed groups are non-nursinginfants (0.00024 mg/kg/day, equivalent to 12.2 percent of the PADI) andnursing infants (0.00016 mg/kg/day, equivalent to 8.0 percent of the PADI).Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes thatthe actual residue levels of linuron consumed by the U.S. population presentno significant risk to public health. The multi-generation rat reproduction study noted earlier, in additionto supporting oncogenic conclusions, raised the possibility of reproductiveeffects. The Agency is requiring additional reproductive effects data througha Data Call In Notice to be issued shortly. Data are also being requiredto resolve remaining concerns about possible hematological and contaminantrisks. If any of these data demonstrate that use of linuron may pose unacceptablerisk, the Agency may reinitiate a Special Review of linuron. Based on the existing data, the Agency proposes to conclude this SpecialReview of registrations of pesticide products which contain linuron withoutfurther regulatory action. <ITAG tagnum="84">V.
