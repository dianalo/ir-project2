Tocomply with ANSI N323-1978, which requires calibration and maintenancerecords for each instrument serviced, a computer database system is useful.Our system uses the commercially available Paradox software with an IBMPersonal Computer. Current status information for each instrument andmaintenance history is now easily accessible. This information includes:most recent calibration date, location, repairs done, and identificationof the service technician. Routine monthly reports listing instrumentsdue for servicing, and semi- annual reports showing complete inventoriesare generated. Statistical information such as excessive repair frequencyand average age of equipment can also be prepared. 2 refs., 4 figs.,2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
