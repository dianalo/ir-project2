(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Effective Menus Are a MustandM;When you look at the command structure of a spreadsheet there are two thingsto keep in mind: the efficiency of the native commands and the ability to useLotus 1-2-3 commands as an alternative.andP;  Lotus has so long dominated thespreadsheet market, and its style of commands has become so familiar, that itis essential for a program to offer these commands--at least as a subset.andO;And even when the command structure is unique, there should be online helpthat can detail the native equivalents of 1-2-3 commands, as exists inMicrosoft Excel for Windows 2.1d.andM;Command or menu efectiveness is still the most important item in thiscategory.andP;  Once you've learned the program's native mode, what counts is howwell that works.andP;  Similarly, the presence of quick-key commands means you canoperate with function keys, or with Altor Ctrl-key ease.andM;For 1-2-3 command compatibility, both Lotus 1-2-3 Release 2.2 and Release 3.1received a 10.andP;  Quattro Pro 2.0 also earned a score of 10 because it offers asuperset of 1-2-3 commands as an alternative, giving you the flexibility ofusing the native commands or 1-2-3 commands.andP;  The menus that are largelycompatible with 1-2-3 use a symbol to tell you which commands indicatefeatures added by Quattro.andP;  Macros created in 1-2-3 versions 2.2 or earlierwill run without a hitch when using this menu.andM;Close behind in the scoring for 1-2-3 command compatibility are SuperCalc5Rev D, Diamond 2.5, and Twin Level 3.07.andP;  All three have a subset of 1-2-3commands that is quite close to being fully compatible and can be used as analternate means of running the program.andP;  PlanPerfect 5.1 offers a somewhatmore limited set of 1-2-3 commands as an alternative.andM;SuperCalc 5 lets users invoke 1-2-3 commands in two ways: You can enter a1-2-3 command sequence after invoking the 1-2-3 mode, or simply turn on aglobal 1-2-3 mode.andP;  In SuperCalc mode pressing F1 provides an Answer Screenthat gives the SuperCalc5 command equivalent for the 1-2-3 command you havejust entered.andM;PlanPerfect users can change function-key definitions to work like 1-2-3function keys.andP;  This approach won't let you forget you are in anotherprogram, but it certainly lets you enter commands in the 1-2-3 manner.andP;  Lucid3D 2.2, Smart-Ware II 1.02, Wingz 1.1, and Excel lack command compatibilitywith 1-2-3.andM;If you're new to spreadsheets, any familiar command structure will help thelearning process.andP;  For example, those from the word processing world ofWordPerfect should find PlanPerfect's default command system a snap:Keystroke sequences are much the same as in WordPerfect.andM;In determining scores for Menu effectiveness, credit was given for use ofstandard conventions, such as F1 for Help, as well as to overall scope andusability of the menus.andP;  Except for PlanPerfect, all the spreadsheetsoffering function keys use F1 for Help.andP;  Most of the other function-keycommands show little variation among the tested spreadsheets.andP;  Exceptions areSmartWare and PlanPerfect, whose commands are unique to the programs.andP;  Abouthalf of Lucid 3D's are non-standardandgt; Wingz doesn't use function-key commandsat all, but it does have Ctrl- and Alt-key combinations that can be used asquick-key commands.andM;Even those programs that agree on F9 as the Calculate key may reveal subtlevariations in the way calculations are performed.andP;  What works a certain wayin one package may be elusively different in another.andP;  Careful error checkingis a must after any change of programs.andM;The top scorers in Menu effectiveness are Quattro Pro and Lucid 3D, bothoffering a robust but convenient menu system.andP;  Bringing up the rear areSmartWare and 1-2-3 Release 3.1andgt; the latter rates below Release 2.2, its lesspowerful relative, because it doesn't have settings sheets in the core partof the programandgt; they're only in the Impress add-in (included in the packagefor free) used for creating WYSIWYG output.andM;As noted, all the tested spreadsheets offer quick-key commands.andP;  Most havemouse support as well, though SuperCalc5, SmartWare, and 1-2-3 Release 2.2are the holdouts in this regard.andP;  With Windows a runaway best-seller, itreally shouldn't be long before even these three take advantage of thesuddenly omnipresent mouse.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
