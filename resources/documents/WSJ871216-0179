For factories alone, the operating rate was the highest since 1980.    The capacity-utilization rate has been creeping upward all year, reflecting strength in the industrial portion of the U.S. economy. The closer that operating rates come to full capacity, however, the greater the chances of renewed inflation, economists say. In November 1986 the rate stood at 79.2%.    The November level was up from a revised 81.5% in October and 81% in September and was the highest since the 81.8% recorded in August 1984. The Fed previously put the October rate at 81.3%. The numbers are adjusted for usual seasonal variations.    Factories operated at 82% of capacity last month, up from 81.8% in October. Manufacturers haven't been this close to full capacity since reporting an 82.1% operating rate in March 1980.    Some industries, including those with strong demand from overseas, are operating at higher rates. The operating rate among producers of iron, steel and other primary metals, for instance, has soared to 87.9% from 71.9% in November 1986.    The Fed said makers of nondurable goods, those intended to last less than three years, operated at 85.1% of capacity, up from 85% in October. Makers of durable goods operated at 79.9%, up from 79.7% the month before.    Among makers of industrial materials, the operating rate rose to 81.6% from 81.3% in October.    Utilities' operating rate in November was 82%, up from 81.6%. The measure for mines was unchanged at 79.2%. </TEXT></DOC>
