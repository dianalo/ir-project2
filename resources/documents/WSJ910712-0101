The guidelines, intended to reduce business practices thatkeep newcomers out of the market, provide examples ofacceptable and unacceptable conduct. The guidelines also notethat in gross violations of the law, the commission, underauthority it never has used, can order companies to disposeof cross-shareholdings of interlocking companies -- a devicesometimes used to prevent competition.   Japan this year revised its antitrust law to increase feeslevied against violators. But U.S. trade negotiators haveargued that the fees are still too low and that Japan shouldimpose criminal penalties and back private suits againstviolators. The new guidelines don't directly affectcommission policies on those issues.   The guidelines, which take effect immediately, also coveraspects of the distribution system, illegal boycotts,price-fixing and reciprocal dealing.                                                                                                          OVERHAUL FOR POLISH BANKING                                                                                                          An East-West partnership will overhaul Poland's commercialbanking system. International Finance Corp., the World Bank'sprivate-sector arm, organized the matching of five Westernbanks with five of the nine commercial banks created lastyear from the former Polish bank monopoly. Each Western bankwill help its Polish counterpart restructure. Basic consumerservices such as checks and credit cards are rare in Poland,and business services are needed to attract foreigninvestors, officials said.                                                                                                          NEPAL UNVEILS ECONOMIC REFORMS                                                                                                          Nepal's first democratic government in three decadespresented its maiden budget, easing state controls in aneffort to increase private participation in the impoverishedeconomy. The proposals include permission for the privatesector to open financial companies, including banks; now, thegovernment operates all domestic banks.                                                                                                          RULING ON PUBLISHING TV LISTS                                                                                                          The European Court of Justice, emphasizing competitionover intellectual property rights, has ruled that British andIrish television programmers must provide their schedules torival publishers of TV listings. The decision upheld aEuropean Community Commission ruling that BritishBroadcasting Corp. and others, by withholding the data, wereabusing dominant market positions. The companies have movedto provide the schedules, so the ruling is important mainlyas a precedent for firms with copyrights, patents ortrademarks.                                                                                                          INDIA MOVES TO OPEN ECONOMY                                                                                                          India outlined a program to reduce bureaucratic controls,shed public companies and encourage foreign investment.Details will be disclosed when the government presents itsdraft budget July 24, but New Delhi is expected to allowforeign investors to hold a majority interest in Indiancompanies for the first time. Foreign investment in thepotential market of 844 million people has totaled less than$200 million a year.                                                                                                          COMPUTER VENTURES IN BRAZIL                                                                                                          Brasilia approved joint ventures between Brazilian andmultinational companies to produce computers with U.S.technology. Brazilian firms also may import printed circuitboards, previously barred by protectionist policy, andcomputer equipment for resale. The first two ventures,International Business Machines Corp.-Sid Informatica andDigital Equipment Corp.-Elebra partnerships, will producemidsized computers. Foreign firms may control as much as 30%of the ventures' capital, and in October 1992, up to 49%;they must invest 5% of sales in local research anddevelopment.                                                                                                          ROMANIA CONSIDERS PRIVATIZATION                                                                                                          Romania's parliament began debate on a proposal todistribute 30% of state-owned industries to the public forfree. The measure, expected to pass within three weeks, isthe cornerstone of Bucharest's economic reforms.   The bill would establish five holding companies thattogether would own 30% of the country's industry. Each adultcitizen would get an equal stake in the five companies anddividends; trading in the shares would follow later. Thestate plans eventually to sell its 70% stake to local orforeign investors.   The bill mandates the holding companies for a five-yeartransition period, after which Romania plans to have aWestern-style stock market.   In another move considered crucial to Romania's transitionto a market economy, real market exchange rates will beintroduced Aug. 1.
