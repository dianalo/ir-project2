The action is the first of its kind taken by California'sDepartment of Food and Agriculture. Industry officials say itcould set the stage for significant expansion of biopesticideuse.</LP><TEXT>   Ecogen closed at $5.875, up 62.5 cents, in nationalover-the-counter trading.   Several major chemical companies, including Monsanto Co.and American Cyanamid Co., are pushing to develop similarproducts and bring them to market. Crop GeneticsInternational Corp., Hanover, Md., has been testing avaccine.   Ecogen Chairman John E. Davies said the approvalrepresents &quot;a strategic opportunity&quot; for the agriculturalbiotechnology company. California constitutes about 50% ofthe total U.S. market for caterpillar-threatened vegetablecrops, he said.   Cutlass received approval in 1989 from the EnvironmentalProtection Agency. It already is sold to farmers in Texas,Florida and Georgia. Ecogen expects to start marketing theproduct later this year in New Jersey, Pennsylvania andDelaware.   California officials said Cutlass was tested and showneffective in controlling the larvae of diamondback moths,cabbage loopers, cabbage webworm and beet armyworms, amongother caterpillars.   John L. McIntyre, Ecogen's vice president for commercialdevelopment, said repeated tests showed the Cutlass bacteriaaren't toxic to beneficial insects or to animals and humans,nor do they contaminate ground water. After the pesticide issprayed on fields and has dried, he said, there isn't anyharmful residue so that workers can quickly resumeharvesting.</TEXT></DOC>
