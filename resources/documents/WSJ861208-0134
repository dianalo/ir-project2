The reports that CARE packages &quot;were turned over directly, unopened to the state&quot; are incorrect. In all commodity distribution by CARE anywhere, all original containers are opened on-site and distributed according to a ration system established by CARE and in-country relief professionals. CARE staff monitors the distribution at each site. Using this system, CARE has delivered 50,000 metric tons of food since our famine-relief operations began in Ethiopia, where we serve 600,000 people a month.    Incidentally, the original CARE packages, which made our organization a household word, have not been distributed since 1967. Our new &quot;package&quot; includes, in addition to 50- or 100-pound food sacks, tree seedlings, mother-and-child health-care facilities, new water systems, and many other components for long-term development projects in the Third World.    Philip Johnston   Executive Director, CARE   New York   ---   The allegation of an Ethiopian &quot;famine tax&quot; (&quot;equal to the amount of food aid an Ethiopian receives from foreign-aid groups&quot;) is untrue. Moreover, all relief commodities and materials enter the country duty-free. Relief agencies do pay port handling fees, which are customary all over the world; the relief community has negotiated preferential rates for emergency consignments -- still high, but not out of line with many other countries. The agencies pay no other duty or tax on their operations in Ethiopia.    It is particularly disturbing also to read the editorial's allegation that those &quot;horrifying scenes of starvation were largely man-made and intentional.&quot; Ethiopia's subsistence-farming society wasn't equipped to cope with several years of drought. There is plenty of justification to abhor the agricultural policies of the authorities, but it was drought, not just the works of man, that produced the desolation in late 1984.    Because of the controversial nature of the Ethiopian government, and tragic civil strife, rigorous accountability has been one of the highest priorities of relief agencies. As a result, American support has directly reached those for whom it was intended. The Christian Relief and Development Agency, the umbrella group of 47 church and lay agencies operating in Ethiopia, recently declared &quot;with confidence that relief assistance has reached and continues to reach those in greatest need.&quot;    Peter J.
