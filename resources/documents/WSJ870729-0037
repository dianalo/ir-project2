Crude oil surged above $21 a barrel on spot and futures markets, as Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, warned that unless Iran accepts the United Nations' proposed cease-fire in their seven-year war, his country might resume its attacks on shipping in the Persian Gulf.    Iran, in turn, vowed to attack U.S. and Kuwaiti targets in the gulf if the two countries persisted in backing Iraq. And, separately, Syria said Iraqi forces shot down a Syrian jet fighter that strayed into Iraqi airspace.    Crude for September delivery at the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 83 cents a barrel to $21.32 -- following a drop in the near-term contract of $1.71, or 8%, in the past week. Meanwhile, gasoline and heating oil contracts rose more than one cent a gallon yesterday.    Spot, or non-contract, oil prices also rose. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, rose 80 cents a barrel to $21.30. And the August price of North Sea Brent, the abundantly traded European blend, rose 25 cents a barrel to $19.60 in late trading.    The last time U.S. oil prices rose more was March 3, when crude surged 96 cents a barrel to $17.35.    &quot;Over half of (yesterday's) move can be directly attributed&quot; to the combined influence of comments from the Middle East, said Rick Donovan, head of the international energy department at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. in New York.    The renewed saber rattling &quot;again goes to show that supplies from the gulf are still precarious,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, an energy futures analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York.    Yesterday's rally also was marked by significant short covering, or buying contracts to offset those sold earlier, traders said.    Meanwhile, inflation concern sparked by higher energy prices spread into the precious metal pits, particularly silver and platinum, traders said. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, July silver rose 23 cents an ounce to $7.951, while August gold rose $2.80 an ounce to $457. July platinum at the New York Merc rose $14.90 an ounce to $610.30.    Some oil specialists suggested that the recent rise in energy prices has been fueled by the tight U.S. gasoline market, particularly in Oklahoma, Missouri and Kansas.    For instance, while the cost of transporting gasoline from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Tulsa, Okla., typically runs about a penny a gallon, spot gasoline prices in Tulsa currently are six cents above that of the Gulf Coast, said Philip Verleger, a visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C.    &quot;The extremely tight gasoline market is leading refiners to bid up the price of crude,&quot; Mr. Verleger said.    And some analysts and traders said they expect strong buying on any sharp drop in prices.    &quot;The $20 area is a significant support level that won't be broken any time soon,&quot; said Hutton's Mr. Donovan.    In other futures markets yesterday:    COPPER: Futures prices rose to their highest levels in almost four years amid continued tightness in supplies. July copper, which slumped Monday amid profit-taking, rose 3.9 cents a pound to 80.5 cents, a life-of-contract high and the first time copper prices have risen above 80 cents a pound since September 1983, an analyst said. The July contract expires today. September copper rose 1.9 cents a pound to 76.85 cents. The recent rise in prices amid seasonally slow demand is significant, said an analyst, because it indicates that the market expects strong autumn demand. Also bolstering prices yesterday was a report from the American Bureau of Metal Statistics that showed brass mill consumption of copper in June was up 11% from a year earlier and rod mill usage was 6% higher. And yesterday's surge in silver and platinum prices helped as well, said Fred Demler, metals economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.    COCOA: Improved weather in the Ivory Coast and other West African cocoa-growing areas continued to depress prices. The Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer. The September contract fell $80 a metric ton to $1,951 on the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange in New York. At one point it fell to $1,935, which brought the total decline since July 17 to $215 a metric ton. The industry may be more inclined to think &quot;that the Ivory Coast crop may not have been damaged as much as has been thought by the recent dry weather,&quot; said Debra Tropp, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. However, while recent rains relieved dry conditions in some Ivory Coast growing areas, other areas still need moisture, said James Roemer, a meteorologist at Weather Trades Inc. in Des Moines, Iowa. The Ivory Coast as a whole, Mr. Roemer said, &quot;will need a lot of rain, between eight inches and 10 inches a month through the summer and fall, to insure that there will be no crop damage.&quot;    LIVESTOCKS AND MEATS: August and October cattle prices fell. The drop in part was seen as a correction of Monday's jump, which was sparked by two cattle inventory reports that tallied fewer animals than some traders expected. Futures prices also fell because unusually hot weather in some parts of the U.S. is depressing consumption of red meat, analysts said. The market returned to the reality &quot;of sluggish beef demand,&quot; said Charles Levitt, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in Chicago. Hog futures prices fell, while pork belly prices rose.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Forecasts of dry and hot weather throughout the Midwest continued to boost futures prices. Freese-Notis Weather Inc., a Des Moines, Iowa, weather forecaster, predicts temperatures in the mid-90s and below-normal rainfall for as long as two weeks in eastern Iowa and western Illinois. Forecasts such as that drove up soybean prices because much of the crop is in its flowering stage, when the lack of rain could do the most damage. &quot;Hot weather from here on out is detrimental to soybean production,&quot; said Dan Markey, an analyst at Agri Analysis in Chicago. Meanwhile, corn and wheat futures prices rose less sharply. Corn has passed its critical pollination stage, while most winter wheat is harvested. </TEXT></DOC>
