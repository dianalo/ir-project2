WILSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSHI, Tanzania (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pope John Paul II ended his five-daypilgrimage to Tanzania today by celebrating Mass at the foot ofMount Kilimanjaro and imploring rich countries to forge ``a new eraof solidarity'' with Africa.   ``Let the world not forget the urgent needs of the peoples ofAfrica,'' the pope said before flying to the central Africancountry of Burundi, the second leg of his 10-day, four-nation tour.   John Paul, making his seventh trip to Africa, said he waspleased with the growth of the Roman Catholic Church in Tanzania,but he could not ignore that millions of Africans continue to livein poverty.   ``I implore God's gifts of comfort, strength and peace uponthose who suffer or are in need on this continent,'' he said in adeparture speech. ``In the name of our common humanity I appeal tothe more developed nations of the earth to inaugurate a new era ofsolidarity with Africa, based on justice and respect.''   Earlier today, about 40,000 people attended the pope's Mass inKilimanjaro Stadium, a former cricket and polo grounds of Britishrulers.   When John Paul arrived, the 19,300-foot snowy peak of Africa'stallest mountain broke through clouds that obscured it much of themorning.   In his homily, the pontiff paid tribute to the missionaries whobrought Christianity to northern Tanzania 100 years ago.   ``The many saints and martyrs of the young African churches showthat what has been handed on since apostolic times need not bewatered down in order to penetrate the rich soil of Africa,'' hesaid. ``The heroic response to the demands of conversion and thechallenge of martyrdom constitutes a glorious page in the historyof your particular churches.''   The pope encouraged his flock to practice their faith in ``anauthentically African way'' by incorporating their customs, cultureand traditions in the church.   ``By illuminating and purifying these elements of local lifewith the Gospel and bringing them into Catholic unity, the wholechurch is marvelously enriched,'' he said.   The pope has urged Roman Catholics to shun such practices aswitchcraft and polygamy, stressing that the basic tenets of thefaith cannot be compromised.   Among the gifts for the pope was a stuffed lion brought to theedge of the altar on the back of a pickup truck by a Masai Moran,or warrior, dressed in the tribe's traditional toga-like robe ofred and blue.   To mark the pope's visit, members of the Mount KilimanjaroMountain Club scaled the peak and placed a plaque at the summit.   ``We pray that this visit will sow the seeds of peace, love,progress and understanding among the people of Tanzania, Africa andthe whole world,'' the plaque read.   The pope will also travel to Rwanda and the Ivory Coast, wherehe will end his tour next week by consecrating the massive basilicaof Our Lady of Peace.</TEXT></DOC>
