Nopickup.</NOTE><DATELINE>MORELIA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An Israeli counterterrorism expert whobriefed Vice President George Bush on secret arms sales to Iran diedin a plane crash in a remote area of Mexico while traveling under anassumed name, officials said.   The Cessna T210 crashed Wednesday at a ranch 110 miles west ofMexico City, killing the Israeli, Amiram Nir, 37, and the pilot.Three other passengers were badly injured, including AdrianaStanton, 25, of Canada.   Nir was traveling under the name Pat Weber, Isauro GutierrezFernandez, a spokesman for the Michoacan state attorney general,said Thursday.   Israel's ambassador to Mexico, Dov Schmorak, said in an interviewbroadcast today on Israel's armed forces radio that he did not knowwhy Nir was in Mexico or why he used that name.   Gutierrez said engine failure was the probable cause of the crash.   But Schmorak told the radio that Mexican authorities saidpreliminary information that suggested the crash was caused by aviolent rain storm.   A Foreign Ministry official in Jerusalem who spoke on conditionof anonymity told the radio Nir was on private business.   Nir, a former adviser on counterterrorism to two Israeli primeministers, was an important liaison in secret arms deals involvingthe sale of U.S. weapons to Iran, according to testimony given toU.S. congressional investigators.   Former White House aide Oliver North, who was deeply involved inthe U.S.-Iranian arms transactions, suggested during congressionaltestimony that the Contra link _ diverting funds from U.S. armssales to Iran to Nicaraguan rebels _ was Nir's idea. Israel deniedit.   Nir was sought for questioning by Special U.S. ProsecutorLawrence E. Walsh. Israel insisted Nir be granted immunity fromprosecution.   Schmorak told the radio Nir apparently missed a regularlyscheduled flight and hired a private plane.   Gutierrez said Nir arrived Sunday in Mexico City and traveled toUruapan, 190 miles west, to stay with friends.   ``It appears he had some possible business involving shipments ofproducts from Latin America to Europe,'' Gutierrez said. He refusedto elaborate.   A state attorney general's statement identified the dead pilot asPedro Espinoza Hurtado, 34, and the others injured as GuillermoJoaonde Amezqua, 35, and Ester Areaga, 23.   An airport official in Uruapan said the Cessna was bound forMexico City.   The plane, belonging to Aerotaxis of Uruapan, took off Wednesdayafternoon from Uruapan and crashed 30 minutes later near CiudadHidalgo, the statement said.   Nir was a close associate of Shimon Peres, now foreign ministerof Israel. Peres, prime minister from 1984-86, appointed Nir adviseron counterterrorism in 1985 and assigned him to serve as liaisonwith North.   In January 1986, Nir met in Washington with North and Adm. JohnPoindexter, the National Security adviser, and proposed to renewarms shipments to Iran.   Nir also met with North in Israel and Europe, discussing U.S.arms sales to Iran through Israel and the diversion of profits tothe Contras, despite a congressional ban on military aid to therebels.   Nir also traveled to Tehran, Iran, in May 1986 with North andformer National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane to discuss therelease of American hostages held by pro-Iranian extremists inLebanon in return for the supply of anti-aircraft Hawk missiles.   Nir briefed Bush on the program involving U.S. weapons sales toIran in Jerusalem on July 27, 1986. Bush has said he does notremember much about the briefing, but his aide Craig Fuller attendedthe meeting and took notes.   Nir, a former journalist, remained on after Yitzhak Shamirsucceeded Peres as prime minister in October 1986, and theIran-Contra affair exploded that November. He resigned this year.   Israeli leaders admitted selling weapons to Iran but only incooperation with the United States. Israel also denied any knowledgeof the Contra connection.</TEXT></DOC>
