The parents decided last year to pursue the case on their ownafter the attorney general for Cape Province declined to prosecutethe policemen despite a magistrate's finding of police negligence.   The trial that opened Tuesday in Cape Town Supreme Court isreportedly the first murder case to proceed under a law allowingprivate citizens to press a prosecution in certain instances wherethe government has declined.   The 1985 confrontation, which occurred during anti-apartheidunrest in a mixed-race township near Cape Town, has become widelyknown as the ``Trojan Horse incident'' because white police gunmenconcealed themselves in a what looked like an ordinary deliverytruck.   Footage of the incident was shown at the time on television newsbroadcasts in the United States and Britain.   According to evidence at the inquest, an army commandant and twosenior police officers ordered the truck into the township ofAthlone expecting it to be a target for stonethrowers.   Gunfire from the concealed policemen killed Shaun Magmoed, 16;Michael Miranda, 11, and Jonathan Classens, 21, but the magistrateruled there was no evidence that any of the three were among ahandful of mixed-race youths who did throw stones.   The officers in the crates popped out of the hiding places andfired 39 rounds of shotgun ammunition at the crowd, according tothe evidence.   The private prosecution was instituted by Miranda's mother andMagmoed's father. Their lawyers are to be paid with proceeds from afund set up last year which has received contributions from variousoverseas human rights organizations.   Defense lawyers are being paid with public funds.   The law providing for private prosecutions allows the defense toask that the prosecutors pay the defendants' entire legal costs ifthe case ends in acquittal.   At the start of Tuesday's proceedings, defense lawyers askedthat the prosecution be ordered immediately to post a deposit of$360,000 to cover possible legal costs. The request was taken underconsideration by the judge.</TEXT></DOC>
