The little-noticed provision to curb an existing deductionfor movies was included in the tax plan that Chairman DanRostenkowski proposed this month to fellow Democrats on theHouse Ways and Means Committee. The next day, when theChicago Democrat offered a substitute package to satisfy hiscolleagues' various objections, the movie provision was gone.</LP><TEXT>   In the intervening hours, industry lobbyists had stormedthe committee to get the provision killed. There was, ofcourse, the top gun, Jack Valenti. The former Johnsonadministration White House official, who heads the MotionPicture Association of America, made calls to severalDemocrats and key staff members. Other lobbyists with closeties to the panel also worked the phones. But it was WaltDisney Co. and its lobbyist Richard Bates who got ArkansasRep. Beryl Anthony, Mr. Bates's former boss, to deal thefatal blow to the provision, according to those familiar withthe events.   A committee analyst had described the provision during thepanel's closed-door deliberations as one that would bring theindustry's tax accounting into the 1990s. But it couldn'twithstand the industry onslaught; of all the provisions inthe Rostenkowski package, the movie proposal sparked thehottest response, insiders say.   Mr. Valenti was on vacation and couldn't be reached overthe weekend, said an Motion Pictures Associationrepresentative, adding that only Mr. Valenti could comment onany aspect of the tax bill. Rep. Anthony and Mr. Bates didn'treturn phone calls.   The massive Democratic tax bill goes to the full House fora vote this week, minus the film provision that would havecost the industry at least $50 million and as much as $100million a year in higher taxes, according to congressionalestimates. Generally, it would have forced studios to takesmaller up-front deductions for depreciating their films andto spread the write-off over a longer period.   The provision would have overturned a 21-year-old Treasuryruling that was intentionally generous to the politicallypluggedin movie industry even when it was devised back in theNixon administration. &quot;It gave them massive tax deductions,&quot;according to a Treasury official from that time.   Now that's more true than ever. What's crucial to a filmowner's calculation of the depreciation claimed on a movie isthe forecast of total income that will be earned over time.But under the 1971 ruling, total income basically meansticket sales; film owners could ignore their potentialprofits from television syndication and overseas distributionrights, among other sources. And in the two decades since,those other profits have ballooned with the spread of cabletelevision and the advent of home-video rentals.   The tax calculation works this way: A film owner figuresout how much to depreciate by dividing the year's actualincome from a film by the total income that is forecast, andthen multiplying that by the film's cost. Take, for example,a film that costs $30 million, earns $40 million the yearafter its fall release and is expected to make $100 millionover time. The $30 million is multiplied by 40%, for awrite-off of $12 million the first year. But if total incomewere $150 million when revenue from such sources as TV rightsand video rentals is counted, as the Rostenkowski provisionwould have required, the first-year deduction in this examplewould drop to about $7 million.   &quot;I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that provision inthe chairman's bill,&quot; said Rep. Brian Donnelly (D., Mass.), apanel member who last year introduced a similar proposal.&quot;But I knew that with the power of this industry, it wouldnever see the light of day.&quot;   The now-dead provision was paired with a separateproposal, still in the bill, that the industry had sought.That proposal would exempt movie rights, other than thoseacquired in the purchase of a business, from a new 14-yearwrite-off for what are known as intangible assets; currentlyfilm owners can depreciate a movie in one or two years, taxexperts say.   Mr. Valenti, a major Democratic Party contributor,protested more than once to lawmakers and staff members.Among committee Democrats, Rep. Anthony as well as Reps.Robert Matsui of California, Marty Russo of Illinois andThomas Downey of New York came to the industry's defense. &quot;Wewere caught completely off guard,&quot; said Rep. Matsui, whosehome state is the movie capital. &quot;Thank goodness we were ableto take it off.&quot;   But first Rep. Anthony proposed to go one better; heserved notice that he would offer an amendment that would notonly kill the provision but also bar the Treasury from everchanging the current depreciation formula. Those close to thecommittee link Rep. Anthony's role to Disney's Mr. Bates.When Rep. Anthony headed the Democratic CongressionalCampaign Committee, the House Democrats' fund-raising office,Mr. Bates was his executive director.   &quot;We had the votes. The amendment would have passed,&quot; saidRep. Matsui, who argues that film owners would have a hardtime forecasting income as the provision required. Faced withthat threat, committee staff members say, Rep. Rostenkowskidecided to drop his provision, and Rep. Anthony withdrew his.</TEXT></DOC>
