Bennett didn't quite hit the lotteryafter resigning as education secretary last September, but he cameclose, more than quadrupling his assets by speaking and writing.   Bennett, nominated by President Bush to lead the government's waron illegal drugs, says he now has assets of $460,630. In contrast, afinancial disclosure form submitted on his status as last Sept. 20reflected assets ranging from $51,000 to $107,000.   Bennett says he has set aside $130,000 this year for federalincome tax.   According to financial statements Bennett submitted to the SenateJudiciary Committee and the White House, he has cash on hand and inbanks totaling $340,500 plus personal property worth $28,000, asavings plan worth $11,000 and a retirement annuity worth $81,000.   The Senate Judiciary Committee opened confirmation hearings todayon Bennett's nomination to be director of the Office of NationalDrug Control Policy.   Bennett earned almost $240,000 from 24 speaking engagements thatbrought him up to $14,000 per lecture, the statements show.   In addition, Bennett said he has received $187,500 as an advancepayment from Simon andamp; Schuster Inc. against royalties on two books heagreed to write in a contract signed last October.   He is to receive $93,750 on delivery and acceptance of each ofthe two manuscripts, and he is to receive royalties on the bookswhen they exceed the amount advanced to him, according to thestatements.   ``I plan to complete work on the first book before I entergovernment service,'' Bennett said, but he won't be able to writethe second one, which was to be completed within a year after thefirst is done.   That part of the contract is being renegotiated, but Bennett'sattorney, Bob Barnett of the Washington law firm of Williams andamp;Connolly, refused to say Tuesday whether Bennett planned to returnany of the advance to Simon andamp; Schuster.   ``We're still in the process of renegotiating the contract,''Barnett said, adding that it should be completed by the end of theweek. He said details of the new agreement would be filed with theOffice of Government Ethics.   Bennett also earned $44,670 in salary from The Madison Center, apolicy group that he created with $500,000 in start-up funds fromThe Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation of Milwaukee.   Bennett has agreed that if he is confirmed as drug director, hewill disqualify himself from any matter involving Simon andamp; Schuster,The Madison Center, the Bradley Foundation, the Aspen Institute forHumanistic Studies, the Kraft Foundation and Georgetown University,said Arnold Intrater, general counsel for the office ofadministration in the executive office of the president.   Bennett's wife, Elayne, works for a project housed at GeorgetownUniversity but funded by the Bradley Foundation, according toBennett's disclosure form.   In addition, he has agreed to resign from numerous positions withnon-profit foundations: president of The Madison Center, member ofthe board of directors of the Bradley Foundation, the Institute forEducational Affairs and the Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge,Pa., as well as a consultant to the Aspen Institute and the KraftFoundation, an adviser to the Free Congress Foundation and a memberof the board of advisers for the Center for Security Policy.   In 1988, Bennett earned $12,500 as director of the KraftFoundation, $10,000 as director of the Aspen Institute and $1,250 asdirector of the Bradley Foundation.   Frank Q. Nebeker, director of the government ethics office, saidin a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, ``We believe that Mr.Bennett is in compliance with applicable laws and regulationsgoverning conflicts of interest.''   However, that was contingent on Bennett's agreement to resignfrom all outside positions and receive counseling from an ethicsofficial to assure that he does not use government time andresources to complete his book or keep his former associations.   The government ethics office didn't have much time to review theform. The office received the form last Friday and approved it thesame day.</TEXT></DOC>
