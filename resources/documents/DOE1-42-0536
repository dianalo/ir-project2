The model differsfrom most of the other coal market models currently being used. Its mainattractions are its moderate size, its CPU run times of one to two minutes,and its position in the public domain. The proposed model is intendedto provides a scenario capable of meeting the sulfur dioxide emissionsfrom US industries by shifting the coal market through regulation. Theresults shift much of the coal production from the interior US to thesoutheast US. The modeling methods and design are described.</TEXT></DOC>
