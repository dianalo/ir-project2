The company said it agreed to pay about $7 million to settle the antitrust suit against it and three of its Florida subsidiaries. The suit charged the Dean units, and other milk suppliers, with rigging bids for milk distributed to Florida schoolchildren.    Other dairy processors named in the suit were Southland Corp. of Dallas; Borden Inc. of Columbus, Ohio; Flav-o-rich Inc., a unit Dairymen Inc. of Louisville, Ky.; Pet Inc., a unit of Chicago's IC Industries Inc.; and Kraft Inc. of Glenview, Ill.    According to the attorney general's office, Pet Inc., like Dean, settled the charges yesterday as well. Pet agreed to pay about $1.5 million, a spokeswoman for the attorney general said. &quot;It was a business decision,&quot; said an IC Industries spokesman. In June, Southland agreed to pay the state about $10 million to settle the charges.    Dean said it will restate its total dollar earnings for the fiscal year to $42.8 million from $50.8 million, or $1.90 a share. Sales were $1.55 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
