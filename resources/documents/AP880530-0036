Once the giant U.S. flag was set ablaze, police fired tear gasfrom armored vans and hundreds of riot troops in green combatfatigues and visored helmets charged protesters in front of Seoul'scentral railway station.   About 10,000 protesters had gathered outside the station aftermarching with the coffin of a student who set himself on fire in anearlier anti-government protest. Police did not intervene duringthe peaceful four-mile march.   South Korea has during the past two weeks been hit by a wave ofviolent anti-government and anti-U.S. protests by radical studentswho are calling for the overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo andremoval of the 42,000 U.S. troops on their soil.   Roh, a former general who took office in February after winningan election two months earlier, ordered a crackdown Friday to haltprotests. He said the radicals were threatening the Olympic Gamesto be held in Seoul in September.   In a speech today to the opening session of the NationalAssembly, Roh appealed to opposition parties to work with him toensure full democracy and stability.   He called for an end to political violence and peace on collegecampuses.   In April 26 elections, the governing party lost its majority inthe National Assembly for the first time ever.   Today's march, like other recent protests in which U.S.diplomatic offices were attacked, was vehemently anti-American.Radicals claim the United States enforces military rule in SouthKorea and enforces partition of the Korean peninsula.   ``Drive out the Yankees who block unification of ourfatherland,'' said one speaker.   Marchers yelled anti-American slogans as they walked past a U.S.Army housing compound where a line of armed U.S. military policestood guard, but there were no incidents.   The radical protesters screamed ``drive out the Yankeeimperialists'' and cheered as the American flag burned. They tossedfirebombs at it to further fuel the blaze.   A handful of students also hurled firebombs at attacking police,but most protesters and hundreds of commuters and onlookers ran forcover as authorities chased them.   Police seized some protesters and dragged them away, but policeofficials declined to give arrest figures. Officers tossed tear-gasgrenades at bystanders who complained about the police attack.   There were no immediate reports of injury.   Lines of riot police with interlocked shields swept the squarein front of the train station clean. Other officers hunted in thestation for hiding students and smashed scores of unused firebombsabandoned by protesters.   Choi Duk-soo, for whom the funeral march was held, died Thursday.   He had set himself on fire May 18 to protest the holding of astudent spring festival on the anniversary of a 1980anti-government uprising in the southern city of Kwangju.   The coffin, escorted by hundreds of students in buses, left thestation to travel to Kwangju for burial just before police attacked.   During the earlier funeral march through the city, protesterscarried hundreds of placards bearing portraits of Choi. Musiciansin white mourning clothes beat drums and singers performed hauntingfuneral songs.   The coffin was carried at the head of the column behind a giantSouth Korean flag. A large portrait of Choi surrounded by orangeflames followed on a truck draped in black.   ``Down with military dictatorship'' and ``Fight to the end,''read slogans on a sea of 30-foot-high green, black, and white silkbanners carried by marchers.   Choi's was the second political suicide by a radical student ina month. Cho Sung-man stabbed himself and jumped off a building May15.   Ritual suicide is a traditional form of protest to shame thegovernment.   Today's speakers blamed Roh and the United States for the bloodysuppression of the Kwangju uprising, in which at least 191 peoplewere killed.   The recent demonstrations have failed to draw much publicsupport, and they have been confined mainly to radical collegestudents, a small but powerful minority. Major riots last summerhad strong support and prompted the government to accept elections.</TEXT></DOC>
