Infact, you may be able to do much or all of your faxing fromyour desk, using equipment you already own: a personalcomputer and laser printer.</LP><TEXT>   A growing array of add-on products give computers andprinters faxing ability. Depending on your needs, PCs andprinters can replace, or at least supplement, stand-alone faxmachines. Properly equipped, they can mimic the three mainparts of fax machines: a mechanism for scanning documents tobe faxed, a special built-in phone for sending or receivingimages of documents, and a printing mechanism for reproducingfaxes on paper.   There are limitations to faxing without fax machines. Thebiggest drawback is that most setups can only sendcomputerized documents, not paper ones. But on the receivingend, you have the pleasure of being free from greasy, curlyfax paper. You can simply read faxes on the screen, or printthem out on regular paper using your computer's laserprinter.   The most popular faxing device for computers is a faxmodem. These products combine, in one unit, a standard modem-- the specialized phones that send and receive computer data-- and the telephonic guts of a fax machine.   To transmit a fax with these devices, you use specialsoftware to send an electronic document through the fax modemto a regular fax machine elsewhere. When someone sends a faxto you from a fax machine, the fax modem answers the call andturns the transmission into a computer graphic image that canbe displayed on your screen or printed on your laser printer(but would require massaging before it could be edited inyour word processor).   I've tried two fax modems: the $179 Fax96 1-Liner byFrecom, of Fremont, Calif., for my IBM-compatible PC; and the$269 DoveFax, by Dove Computer, Wilmington, N.C., for myMacintosh computer. Both work well, but there are manyothers.                                                                                                          Before choosing a fax modem, consider the software itincludes. The software should be easy to use and install, andshould let you maintain an automated phone list for quick andsimple sending, view and manipulate incoming faxes and createcustomized cover pages.   Dove's software and other Macintosh faxing programs allowyou to fax documents directly from word processors or otherprograms by going through the same steps you would to printthe document but selecting the fax modem as your &quot;printer.&quot;An impressive $75 program called Winfax, from DelrinaTechnology of Toronto, lets you do the same thing onIBM-compatible computers running Microsoft's Windows program.   Some fax programs have special features. The Fax96 modem'ssoftware automatically determines whether an incoming call isa regular voice phone call, a fax call or a standard computerdata transmission. Calera Recognition Systems, Sunnyvale,Calif., offers a $99 Windows program called FaxGrabber thatautomatically turns faxes being received by a fax modem intotext that can be edited in your word processor.   A key advantage of using your computer as a fax machine isthat you can simply look at faxes on the screen and deletethe ones you don't want without wasting time or paper byprinting them. But a disadvantage is that, if you receive alot of faxes, they can hog your computer's memory and diskstorage space.                                                                                                          One solution is to buy an add-on device that turns a laserprinter into a stand-alone fax machine, without requiringincoming faxes to go through your computer. The JetFax II byJetFax, Menlo Park, Calif., was an early entry in thismarket. A slender box, it sits beside a Hewlett-PackardLaserJet or compatible printer and automatically routesincoming faxes to the printer. H-P now offers its owncompeting fax add-on, a bigger unit called the LaserJet Fax.Both devices can send computer files as faxes, but the H-Pcan also send paper documents.   These two products are relatively costly (around $700 forthe JetFax II, nearly $1,000 for the LaserJet Fax). Tall TreeSystems of Palo Alto, Calif., offers a compact, $399alternative called Fax-O-Matic. This little black box merelylets an H-P or compatible laser printer receive faxes,without the involvement of the computer. Extended Systems ofBoise, Idaho, makes a $599 device, the FaxConnection, thatgoes inside an H-P laser printer to enable it to receivefaxes.   The most elegant solution is the LaserScript Fax by EverexSystems, Fremont, Calif. This is a laser printer withbuilt-in fax circuitry. It will automatically receive faxesand let you send faxes from the computer. LaserScript Faxsells for $2,500 to $3,000. Eventually, I suspect, most laserprinter makers will offer built-in faxing like this, furthereroding the need for separate fax machines, and that awfulfax paper.                                                                                                          ADDENDUM: A few weeks back, I glibly described internalmodems as &quot;sheets of silicon&quot; with chips mounted on them. Acouple of eagle-eyed readers pointed out that the main partof the modem isn't made of silicon, only the chips. I standcorrected.</TEXT></DOC>
