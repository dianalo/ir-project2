A federal jury found 10 Chicago Board of Trade soybeanfutures traders guilty of the vast majority of the more than300 charges against them. In the most significant win for theprosecutors, eight of the traders were found guilty ofviolating anti-racketeering and racketeering-conspiracy laws,among other fraud charges.</LP><TEXT>   The verdict should restore momentum to the tradinginvestigation. The probe was slowed last summer, when a juryin the first trial stemming from the investigation reachedguilty verdicts on only eight of more than 100 counts againstthree Swiss-franc futures traders.   The stiff penalties facing the eight racketeers are likelyto act as a strong deterrent against further fraud on theexchange floors, even if many more traders aren't indicted asa result of the continuing investigation. The eight tradersfound guilty under the racketeering laws are likely to faceat least three years in prison, as well as forfeiture ofassets -- including exchange memberships -- and incomederived from the racketeering scheme under which they wereconvicted.   &quot;This looks like a stinging sweep for the government,&quot;said Robert Tarun, a defense attorney and former assistantU.S. attorney in Chicago.   The eight traders found guilty of violatinganti-racketeering laws are Bradley Ashman, Charles Bergstrom,Edward Cox III, Martin J. Dempsey, Joel J. Fetchenhier,Thomas P. Kenney, Sheldon Schneider and John A. Vercillo.   William A. Barcal was acquitted by the jury on aracketeering conspiracy charge, and the 10th trader on trial,John Ryan, wasn't charged with racketeering.   Fred Foreman, a U.S. attorney in Illinois, said theverdict &quot;justified this prosecution.&quot; He added, &quot;It is ourintention to continue this investigation further.&quot;   When the 12 jurors began deliberating just beforeChristmas, most of them were convinced that the government'sevidence was strong enough to convict on nearly all of thecharges, one juror said last night. &quot;We didn't have anytrouble understanding the case that the governmentpresented,&quot; said juror Shelby Pasquini. &quot;I felt that it was avery strong case.&quot; Mrs. Pasquini said most deliberationcentered on the relatively few allegations among the morethan 300 charges about which some jurors had doubts.   More indictments of futures traders are expected in comingmonths.   The 10 traders were among 48 people indicted in 1989 forallegedly stealing customer trading profits in the pits. Togather evidence against the traders, the government hadfederal agents pose as crooked traders for more than a yearand secretly tape-record what the government said wasevidence of corruption in the commodity industry.   The unprecedented investigation cost several milliondollars and focused on the soybean and Treasury-bond pits atthe Board of Trade and the Swiss franc and Japanese yen pitsat the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Two federal agents alsostood in the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index pit at theMerc for a few months, but so far no stock-index futurestraders have been indicted.   Board of Trade Chairman William F. O'Connor said thatwhile any indictment or conviction &quot;is one too many for us,everyone should understand that the number of membersindicted was less than two-thirds of one percent of ourmembership.&quot; The 10 traders were suspended from trading onthe exchange pending disciplinary proceedings.   During the nearly three-month trial, defense attorneysargued that, while the defendants did break certain exchangetrading rules, they didn't violate federal anti-fraud andracketeering statutes.   Mr. Dempsey, a principal target of the government stingoperation, was found guilty of 50 felony counts, in additionto two racketeering counts. Assistant U.S. Attorney MarkRotert said in his opening statement in September that Mr.Dempsey, a husky trader from Chicago's South Side, was &quot;thebiggest thief in the courtroom.&quot;   James Epstein, Mr. Dempsey's attorney, couldn't be reachedfor comment.   Robert Martin, attorney for defendant Sheldon Schneider,said that as a result of the sweeping verdict against hisclient and the other nine defendants, &quot;there will be stiffjail sentences imposed, that's for sure.&quot;   No sentencing date has been set.   Judge George Marovich will determine the amount each ofthe traders convicted under the racketeering laws will haveto forfeit.   Attention now shifts to the continuing trial of 12 ChicagoMerc Japanese yen-futures traders, which has been under waysince early September. The trial is expected to conclude inmid-February. Two other yen-futures traders face trial laterthis year on similar charges of stealing from customers.   ---   Jeffrey Taylor contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
