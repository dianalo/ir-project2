The laboratory mice were altered to make them more susceptibleto cancer, and have been in use in experiments at Harvard since1984, said University spokeswoman Lilliam Blacker.   Patent Commissioner Donald J. Quigg said using the animal willsimplify cancer research and make it easier to test bothcancer-causing substances and chemicals that fight cancer.   The action drew fire from Jeremy Rifkin, who heads a coalitionof groups opposed to genetic engineering.   He termed the action a usurpation of power by the Patent Office,noting that there have been discussions in Congress of imposing amoratorium on such patents until ethical questions can be workedout.   Quigg, however, said that the patent application, which wasfiled in 1984, met the legal criteria for a patent, and so one wasissued. Ethical questions, he said, need to be settled in Congressand the medical laboratories, not the Patent Office.   While this was the first patent on an animal, plants and formsof bacteria have been patented previously.   The Supreme Court in 1980 ruled that man-made life organismscould be patented, but the Harvard patent is the first to protect agenetic change in a higher life form.   The patent was issued to Harvard University, with the inventorslisted as Philip Leder and Timothy A. Stewart.   Quigg said his office has 21 other applications for animalpatents pending. Details could not be disclosed, however, he said.   He said that virtually any changed animal could be patented,except humans.   Patents allow the inventor the exclusive right to use a productfor 17 years, although in practice the patent holder usuallylicenses use of the product for a fee.   ``This opens the floodgates for a whole range of patents, fromfish to house pets,'' said Jack Doyle of the Environmental PolicyInstitute, which supports a moratorium on animal patents.   But Geoffrey Karny, a Washington patent attorney, said theaction was ``not a radical departure from existing policy.''   ``Granting a patent on animals is an entirely logicalapplication of existing patent law principles, and in many respectsis nothing different from what society has been doing with regardto the commercial ownership of animals for thousands of years.''</TEXT></DOC>
