HIDLAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some 2,600 rail workers went on strike after themorning rush hour today but were back on the job two hours later,in time for the evening commute, after Congress quickly imposed acooling-off period.   The strike against the Chicago and North Western TransportationCo. idled 4,900 other union workers who honored picket lines inChicago, Kansas City and otrher sites, and halted service inChicago and elsewhere in the Midwest.   The railroad serves 41,000 commuters a day in the nation'sthird-largest city and moves freight on 6,400 miles of track in 10Midwestern states.   The strike by 2,600 members of the United Transportation Union,originally scheduled to begin shortly after midnight, was delayedseveral hours after Candamp;NW agreed to postpone the elimination of thejobs of 1,156 train brakemen.   The brakemen and conductors went back to work shortly afterCongress, on a unanimous voice vote, passed a bill extending acooling-off period in the dispute to Sept. 9.   The plan had been worked out among representatives of therailroad, the union and members of Illinois' congressionaldelegation.   Sen. Paul Simon and Rep. Terry Bruce, both Illinois Democrats,said they expected President Reagan to sign the measure thisafternoon.   During the cooling-off period, the union may not strike and thecompany is prohibited from eliminating any jobs, Bruce said.   The dispute centers on a Candamp;NW plan to cut most of its traincrews from four to two workers.   Donald Markgraf, general chairman of the railroad workers union,said he supported the extended cooling-off period and wasoptimistic the dispute could be resolved.   ``I think there should be more time to negotiate this issue,''Markgraf said. ``All disputes have got to be resolved some day. I'mnot trying to start strikes.''   Some commuters faced delays up to 15 minutes today because ofvandalism to signal equipment, said James Foote, a spokesman forCNW Corp., the railroad's parent company. Foote refused tospeculate on who may have caused the damage.   Commuters were relieved that the strike was delayed until afterrush hour.   ``I would have had to take two buses and an el train to get towork,'' said Duane Stewart, a purchasing manager, adding that itwould have taken him an extra hour. ``I was really not lookingforward to this morning.''   In April, Reagan issued an executive order barring either sidefrom taking action until 30 days after a presidential emergencyboard submitted recommendations for a settlement.   The presidential board recommended last month that Candamp;NW cut onebrakeman per train, as a compromise, and that elimination of thesecond should be decided through binding arbitration on atrain-by-train basis.   The railroad initially rejected the proposal, but then offeredMonday to accept it in hopes of averting a strike. Union officialsrejected that offer.   ``We're not optimistic anything will change,'' said CNWspokesman Fred Bloedorn. ``But we've agreed to give it a chance.''</TEXT></DOC>
