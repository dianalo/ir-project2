(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Students shouted ``Tiger bait! Tiger,bait!'' at a man who for nearly five hours occupied the outer cageof Louisiana State University's 500-pound Bengal tiger mascotbefore he surrendered.   The intruder, Moacyr Cezar, a 49-year-old native of Sao Paulo,Brazil, who has lived in Baton Rouge two years, merely wanted ajob, authorities said.   He seized the keys of the cage from a student trainer Wednesdayevening and then demanded in broken English and Portuguese to speakwith LSU basketball coach Dale Brown, said university spokesmanGary Ballard.   Marksmen stood by with tranquilizer guns in case the tiger gotloose. A police SWAT team also stood by.   At one point, some of the hundreds of students who came to watchchanted: ``Tiger bait! Tiger bait!'' _ the cry used at LSU sportingevents when opposing teams enter.   Cezar surrendered after talking with Jose Vargas, LSU's centerwho is from the Dominican Republic.   ``He's upset, man. He's going to be all right,'' Vargas saidafter Cezar surrendered.   Cezar was booked on first-degree robbery, criminal mischief andcriminal trespassing, said police Sgt. Greg Phares. No bond was setimmediately.   Ballard said Cezar served for the past two semesters as aproctor who was given room and board in LSU's athletic dormitory inreturn for his services as an unpaid supervisor.   ``He wants a job. He has some sort of problem with his temporaryvisa. He says he wants a work permit,'' said Ballard.   Although authorities said they feared he had a pistol and heardhim say he had a bomb, Ballard said no weapons or bomb were foundwhen the standoff ended.   Cezar himself was never in danger from the tiger, a 13-year-oldnamed Mike IV who paced restlessly behind him. And though hethreatened to free the tiger, Cezar didn't leave the barred outercage that surrounds the main cage where the big cat actually lives.   At one point, negotiators passed a document between the cage'sbars to Cezar. Ballard said it was an application for employment.   Brown, in Florida, was told of the incident but had no immediateplans to return, Ballard said.   Brown's wife, Vonnie, and some of LSU's Spanish-speakingbasketball players were among those who talked with Cezar.</TEXT></DOC>
