The legal role and powers of the nine-member council havenot been defined. But it is widely expected to be an innercabinet with significant input into Mr. Gorbachev's effortsto halt the disintegration of the country and move toward afree market.</LP><TEXT>   Its composition is in striking contrast to Mr. Gorbachev'sformer Presidential Council and shows how far he has movedpolitically since the failure of a hard-line coup against himin August.   The former 16-member Presidential Council containedseveral hard-liners and was eliminated several months beforethe coup, when the government was reorganized last spring.   The new inner circle contains former Foreign MinisterEduard A. Shevardnadze and Alexander N. Yakovlev, bothlongtime Gorbachev allies who distanced themselves from himlast winter, when he made a temporary turn toward Communisttraditionalists.   The new council also includes the reformist mayors ofMoscow and St. Petersburg, Gavriil Popov and Anatoly Sobchak.   Other council members are:   Vadim V. Bakatin, newly appointed chief of the KGBsecurity police; Yegor V. Yakovlev, recently appointed tohead the state television and radio company; Nikolai Y.Petrakov, who resigned as an economic adviser last winterwhen Mr. Gorbachev hesitated on market reforms and crackeddown on the Baltic republics; Yevgeny P. Velikhov, deputyhead of the Soviet Academy of Sciences; and Yuri A. Ryzhov,chairman of the Supreme Soviet legislature's committee onscience and technology.</TEXT></DOC>
