(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Still trying to move forward in hisRepublican vice presidential campaign, Sen. Dan Quayle remainsmired in questions about his past.   The latest brushfire to face the Indiana senator is an error inhis official resume, which states that he was the chiefinvestigator in the consumer protection division of the Indianaattorney general's office for two years, when he only had the jobfor several months.   Quayle said Friday he was not trying to pad his resume and thathis Senate staff had prepared it. The biography is dated June 1,1987.   But once again, Quayle's campaign was distracted at a criticalmoment. Now on his first solo campaign trip as the nominee, Quayleis trying to focus attention beyond such questions.   ``All of these issues are side events. Many of them areuntrue,'' Quayle said Friday after taking reporters' questionsabout his erroneous biography, mediocre academic record and variousother matters.   Quayle has appearances today in California. Stuart Spencer, hiscampaign manager, said, ``We'll be talking about more substantiveissues and not personal issues.''   At a Billings, Mont., news conference, Quayle parried questionsabout his academic record, which he acknowledges was mediocre.There have been suggestions that Quayle, who comes from a wealthyIndiana publishing family, pulled strings to get into law schoolafter a poor performance in college.   Quayle said he would not authorize the public release of hisacademic records.   ``I don't want you to go through and pore over all thosemediocre grades I got,'' he said.   At the news conference, Quayle issued a strong statement on guncontrol, blasting Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakisas a ``card-carrying member of the American Civil Liberties Union''and noting that Republican presidential nominee George Bush is ``alife member of the National Rifle Association.''   Also on Friday, Quayle spoke with Bush, who called Quayle'scampaign plane from Texas.   ``There is some momentum building. I can feel it. I can feel theexcitement in the air,'' Quayle told Bush.   Quayle said the vice president did not speak to him about hiserroneous resume during the phone call.   The senator told reporters that the consumer investigation jobwas ``the last job I had of many different jobs in the attorneygeneral's office'' from 1970 to 1971.   Media coverage of Quayle's controversies, including whether heused family influence to get into the National Guard during theVietnam War, has increasingly come under fire at the candidates'rallies and appearances.   At a breakfast in Sioux Falls, S.D., former Gov. William Janklowcriticized media coverage of Quayle as he introduced the senator.   ``The American people can't stand scurrilous, scummy types ofpersonal attacks,'' he said.   Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, told a rally in Farmington, Utah thatthe National Guard question was ``a phony issue.''   ``I've been angry as one who served 20 years in the UtahNational Guard and flew missions to Vietnam,'' he said. ``I'd liketo take some of the press who went to Canada to Vietnam with me.''</TEXT></DOC>
