It isanticipated that the energy output and capacity of the plant will serveCalifornia, Nevada, and other western states. Sierra Pacific Resources(SPR) would act as the Project Manager and Operating Manager for the proposedproject. The site selection study for the proposed plant was conductedin 1981. Several sites were identified in a statewide survey as being environmentallyand technically satisfactory for power plant development. Potential issuesinclude, but may not be limited to, air quality, social and economic impacts,ground and surface water quantity, waste disposal, wildlife and the landtenure adjustment.The proposal includes construction of generating units near Toano Drawin Thousand Springs Valley, Elko County, Nevada. Coal would be suppliedfrom mines in Utah and Wyoming, and is proposed to be delivered to theplant site by rail via Cobre or Wells, Nevada. A total of six million tonsper year is expected to be required at full capacity. The proposed plantsite is located near the Southern Pacific Railroad. Studies are underwayto determine the optimum rail spur location into the site.The planned size and arrangement of the overall project takes into accountthe airshed capacity in the Toano Draw area. Meteorological and air qualitymonitoring has been conducted to document pre-project air quality whichis considered good. Emissions control equipment will be employed to complywith Nevada State law and Environmental Protection Agency regulations.Ground level pollutant concentrations would not exceed levels permittedby National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The plan would require approximately30,000 acre-feet of water annually. Water rights associated with SPR'sland holdings in Thousand Springs Valley would be expected to be sufficientto meet these requirements. Water is proposed to be delivered from wellfields to the plant using a system of pipelines.Energy generated at the plant would be conveyed via new power transmissionfacilities. Transmission corridors and terminals for distributing powerwill not be finally determined until participating utilities have beenidentified. SPR plans to use designated and planned utility corridors asidentified in Federal land use plans within Nevada the maximum practicalextent. Land use amendments may be necessary to accommodate some facilities.Construction of the units would continue over approximately 20 years beginningin early 1991, with the first operating unit proposed to be ready for commercialoperation in 1994. Thereafter, successive units are proposed to be readyfor operation at approximately two-year intervals. Estimates of the averageand peak construction labor force, as well as the plant operating force,are currently being developed. The proposed project would be constructedin a sparsely populated area and most of the project work force would beassembled from beyond reasonable commuting distances. Alternative projectplanning includes providing living accommodations for workers at the site,or in nearby communities.Construction of the power plant is expected to require approximately 2,500acres, of which the majority would be used for the coal stockpile and wastedisposal ponds. Public lands (presently managed by the Bureau of Land Management)will be required for the TSEP project in addition to private land holdings.The public lands needed to accommodate the power plant proposal would beacquired by SPR through a land exchange with the Bureau of Land Management.The Toano Draw area, which has a checkerboard public/private land ownershippattern has been identified by SPR as best suited for the proposed project.In exchange for approximately 11,600 acres of public land in Toano Drawthe Bureau of Land Management would acquire approximately 11,500 acresof private land in the Snake Mountain Range west of Wells, Nevada. Thoselands are considered to be high resource value lands that would provideimportant range, wildlife, watershed and recreation management opportunitiesfor the Bureau of Land Management and the public.The no action alternative will be analyzed in the EIS. Items to be consideredfor analysis within other alternatives to the proposed action include,but are not limited to: (1) Intermediate plant capacity, (2) Other typesof power generating technology, (3) Scheduling of units, (4) Power plantsites, (5) Transmission line routes, (6) Location of worker accommodations,(7) Fuel supply and transport, (8) Water supply, and (9) Plant equipment.The tentative project schedule is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="15">Begin Public Comment Period_February 1990</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">File Final Environmental Impact Statement_August 1990</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Record of Decision_September 1990</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Completing Licensing and Permitting_May 1991</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Begin Construction of Unit 1_Early 1991</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Begin Commercial Operation of Unit 1_Early 1994</ITAG>The Bureau of Land Management's scoping process for the EIS will include:(1) Identification of issues to be addressed; (2) Identification of viablealternatives and (3) Notifying interested groups, individuals and agenciesso that additional information concerning these issues can be obtained.The scoping process will consist of a news release announcing the startof the EIS process; letters of invitation to participate in the scopingprocess; and a scoping document which clarifies the proposed action, alternativesand significant issues being considered to be distributed to selected partiesand available upon request.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>dates: </T2>A Public Scoping Meeting will be held beginning at 7 p.m.,on July 6, 1988 at the Ranch House Cafe at the intersection of State Highway93 and Interstate 80 in Wells, Nevada.Additional briefing meetings will be considered as appropriate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>address: </T2>Written comments will be accepted until July 27, 1988.Comments should be sent to the District Manager, Bureau of Land Management,P.O.
