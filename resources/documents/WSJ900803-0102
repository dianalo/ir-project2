The big securities firm, citing the cyclical downturn onWall Street, said net for the quarter ended June 30 was $33.5million, or 32 cents a share, compared with $47.6 million, or43 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue edged up to $640million from $629.7 million. Many analysts had expected thefirm to earn between 40 cents and 43 cents for the quarter.</LP><TEXT>   Despite the results, however, Bear Stearns remains one ofthe few securities darlings among financial-servicesanalysts.   &quot;I'm not table-pounding any of these stocks, but Bear isthe only one I have a buy on,&quot; says Larry Eckenfelder, ananalyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. &quot;It still hasgood value and not a lot more downside.&quot;   Yesterday, Bear Stearns shares closed at $12, down 62.5cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.   Bear Stearns's results bring to a close an uneven periodfor securities-firm earnings. For the first time in ninemonths, securities firms as a group broke into the black inthe June quarter. But the results were mixed: Merrill Lynch andamp;Co. surprised analysts with a jump in investment-bankingrevenue, while Morgan Stanley Group Inc.'s shares havedropped 18% since its disappointing earnings were releasedlast week.   Bear Stearns's per-share results are adjusted for a 5%stock dividend declared yesterday, to be distributed with theregular quarterly cash dividend of 14 cents on Aug. 31.   Commissions were a little softer than some analysts wereexpecting; apparently an anticipated investment-banking dealdidn't close before the quarter ended, some analysts said.Commission revenue for the quarter was down 22% to $77.9million.   Investment banking revenue rose 4.3%. An increase ininterest and dividend income was offset by an increase ininterest expense.   For the year, Bear Stearns's net income fell 31% to $119.4million, or $1.10 a share, down from $172.4 million, or $1.54a share. Revenue was flat at $2.4 billion. Commission revenuewas down 2% but investment banking revenue dropped 17%.   Strong performances in the areas of mortgage-backedsecurities, government bond and stock trading helped thefourth quarter, Bear Stearns said.   In a statement, Chairman Alan C. Greenberg said &quot;fiscal1990, particularly the first six months, was a tough year forthe investment banking and brokerage industry.&quot; In light ofthat, he said, &quot;we are proud of our results for the quarterand the year.&quot;   Indeed, Mr. Greenberg showed good spirit and a touch ofhumor about the results. &quot;I have always heard that we are ina cyclical business. I am eagerly awaiting the next upwardcycle,&quot; he said in the statement.</TEXT></DOC>
