Reason of disintegration is diversifiedbut the debris avalanche is caused by the destruction of the unstablemountain mass. In the case of the 1888 debris avalanche of Bandai-san,a small steam explosion at the end of the strato-volcanic activity causedthe instability of a part of the mountain mass, inducing a landslide.At the active period of the volcano, a viscous magma penetrates intothe volcano mass, sometimes deforming the mountain body and eventuallyreaching disintegration. Furthermore, an eroded valley on the surfaceof the volcano body develops and disintegrates and, also along the slopeof the volcano, a disintegration towards the sea-bottom will occur.
