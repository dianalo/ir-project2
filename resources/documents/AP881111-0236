According to diplomats and private experts, there is littlereason to suspect that the Khmer Rouge has changed much since the1975-78 period when it killed between 1 million and 2 millionCambodians.   Even if the lower figured is accepted, it meant the death of oneCambodian every two minutes during the three and a half years inwhich the Khmer Rouge sought to eradicate virtually overnight allvestiges of capitalism and to create an exclusivelyagriculture-based society.   The Khmer Rouge, now operating as a large and highly disciplinedguerrilla group, has been projecting an image of moderation lately,admitting that mistakes were made in the past and proclaiming thatthe movement is now guided by the principals of ``liberalcapitalism.''   This claim has been received with almost universal skepticism byexperts on Cambodia.   S.A.M.S. Kibria, the United Nations coordinator for humanitarianassistance to Cambodia, has said that about 7,000 Cambodian refugeeswho were living under Khmer Rouge control in camps along theThai-Cambodian border disappeared earlier this year.   Kibria's allegation was supported by Tony Jackson, the Cambodianpolicy adviser for Oxfam, the international relief agency based inBritain.   Officials at the United Nations, which provides humanitarian aidto the more than 300,000 Cambodian refugees stationed at the Thaiborder camps, said they believe the 7,000 Cambodians alleged to havedisappeared were marched into the Cambodian interior transportingarms to the Khmer Rouge.   About 70,000 Cambodian refugees live in Khmer Rouge-controlledcamps but their fate is largely unknown; the guerrillas generallyrefuse access to outsiders.   The Reagan administration envisions a leading political roleafter the Vietnamese withdrawal for Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who wasCambodian head of state until his ouster in a 1970 coup.   Sihanouk has said that one ``has to be either naive or an idiotto believe that the Khmer Rouge of the 1980's can be different fromthe Khmer Rouge of the 1970's.'' Much of the earlier leadership,including Khmer Rouge chieftain Pol Pot, continues to run themovement from clandestine camps.   Sihanouk heads one of two non-communist resistance forces inCambodia which is fighting the Vietnamese-backed government. Theother is led by former Prime Minister Son Sann. The two groups havean estimated 10,000 troops each and receive non-lethal aid from theUnited States.   But the Khmer Rouge is considered by far the most potent of therebel forces, heightening concern among the United States and otherinterested parties about a return to power by that group.   Partially as the result of Khmer Rouge military pressure, Vietnamhas committed itself to the withdrawal of 50,000 forces by the endof this year and its remaining troops, estimated at about 70,000, by1990.   The Vietnamese announcement was greeted with relief by much ofthe international community, which has applied strong diplomaticpressure on Hanoi to end its military occupation of Cambodia.   At the same time, the possibility that the Khmer Rouge could fillthe power vacuum created by the Vietnamese withdrawal set off alarmbells in foreign ministries on several continents.   Lately, the State Department has been increasingly vocal aboutthe importance of a political settlement in Cambodia that preventsthe Khmer Rouge from assuming the dominant role in Cambodia once theVietnamese leave.   The U.N. General Assembly recently approved its annual resolutioncalling for a Vietnamese withdrawal. But for the first time, in aclear reference to the Khmer Rouge, it also said Cambodia must notreturn to ``the universally condemned policies and practices of therecent past.''   The Cambodian conflict has found China and the Soviet Union onopposite sides.   The principal backers of the Khmer Rouge have been the Chinese,who see the extension of Vietnamese power into Cambodia as a threatto national security. For years, reduction of Soviet influencenearby, either directly or through their main southeast Asian ally,Vietnam, has been a hallmark of Chinese foreign policy.   Under heavy international pressure, China has backed awaysomewhat from its all-out support of the Khmer Rouge effort to driveout the Vietnamese invaders.   ``The Chinese recognize their support for the Khmer Rouge is aliability internationally,'' said one U.S. official.   According to U.S. government experts, the Chinese also may betemporizing their support out of concern that a Khmer Rouge triumphcould induce the Vietnamese to reinvade Cambodia.   Meanwhile, the United States and its friends in the Associationof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been discussing strategiesfor preventing a Khmer Rouge takeover.   Among the possibilities discussed are the formation of aninternational peacekeeping force for Cambodia or the disarming ofthe various armed factions.   Until Hanoi's announcement of its intention to withdraw, theKhmer Rouge component of the Cambodian problem was given secondarypriority by the administration. Now, both aspects of the problem arebeing given equal billing.   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State David Lambertson has toldCongress that the administration ``is unalterably opposed to theKhmer Rouge, whose legacy of brutality and depravity is unsurpassed.   ``We are committed to a settlement in Cambodia that containssafeguards to ensure that the Khmer Rouge can never again takecontrol of Cambodia and subject the Cambodian people once again tothe horrors of the past.''   Still, some in Congress believe the administration remainedsilent too long on the Khmer Rouge.   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., co-sponsor of a resolution criticalof both the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese occupation, assailed the``self-imposed silence of the American government'' in dealing withthe revival of the Khmer Rouge.   Because of this policy, ``the Khmer Rouge was nursed back tohealth by Communist China and are poised to return to their old waysof torturing and terrorizing the people of Cambodia,'' Hatfield said.   With U.S. backing, the United Nations has refused to recognizethe legitimacy of the current government in Phnom Penh and insteadrecognizes what amounts to a Cambodian coalition government inexile, a fragile union made up of the Khmer Rouge and the twonon-communist rebel factions. But the permanent representative ofCambodia at the United Nations is a Khmer Rouge member.   The administration also expressed forceful opposition to a clausein the congressional resolution on Cambodia which demanded an``immediate'' halt to outside support for the Khmer Rouge.   The State Department said that phrasing would be rejected byChin. It successfully lobbied for the removal of the offending word.   Some members of Congress were aghast at this concession by theadministration to the Khmer Rouge but relented out of concern that aprotracted battle could mean the entire resolution would have to beshelved.   President Reagan signed the resolution during the waning days ofthe recently adjourned Congress.   If Vietnam keeps its promise to withdraw, officials say U.S.policy toward Southeast Asia may become a major issue for theincoming Bush administration as it tries to contend with adiscredited group which, for now, is casting the longest shadow overpost-Vietnam Cambodia.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thu AMs, Nov 17</NOTE></DOC>
