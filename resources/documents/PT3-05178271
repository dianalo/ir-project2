The cartons can readily be separated by the consumer for the      sale of an individual carton. </PAL></ABST><PARN> <PAR>  This is a continuation-in-part of copending, commonly-assigned U.S. patent      application Ser. No. 07/774,529, filed Oct. 8, 1991, now U.S. Pat. No.      5,141,106 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates to cigarette cartons, and more particularly to the      connection of two separate cigarette cartons to form a dual carton. </PAR><PAR>  Cigarette packs (which usually contains twenty cigarettes) are generally      rectangular in shape, having front and back long walls and two short side      walls. Cigarette cartons typically contain two rows of five cigarette      packs per row (each row arranged so that the front long walls of the packs      are in the same plane and the back long walls are in a parallel plane      spaced from the front long walls), and are generally known in the art as      ten-pack cartons. Such cigarette cartons are generally filled with      cigarette packs by the manufacturer, temporarily closed (e.g., by folding      the top flap of the carton over the box and releasably securing the flap      in the closed position), and shipped to various distributors. The      distributors generally open the cartons, after they are received, to apply      the tax stamp that may be required by the jurisdiction in which they      operate to the ends of the individual cigarette packs inside the cartons      Such procedures are commonly automated to reduce time, cost, and labor      through the use of specially designed machines for applying tax stamps.      Tax-stamping machines have been developed to open the cartons, apply the      stamps, and finally seal the cartons for distribution. Such machines are      generally commercially available, and are well known in the art. These      machines have been developed for standard ten-pack cigarette cartons. A      typical tax-stamping machine is model FUSON manufactured by Meyercord of      365 East North Avenue, Carol Stream, Ill. 60187. </PAR><PAR>  Single row cigarette cartons which are dimensioned to contain one row of      five cigarette packs (each pack usually containing twenty cigarettes, the      packs arranged so that the front long walls of the packs are in the same      plane and the back long walls are in a parallel plane spaced from the      front long walls), i.e., five-pack cartons, are also known in the art.      However, although machinery exists for manufacturing such cartons,      machinery does not exist for stamping the cigarette packs contained in      such cartons. Consequently, such cartons are usually put into scored,      glued, and collapsed cartons to be hand-stamped (as is done currently), or      would have to be secured together in pairs to be run through the existent      tax-stamping equipment in which packs in double row cartons are stamped.      To assure that the tax stamp is properly registered, the means for      securing the cartons must be strong enough to keep the cartons together      such that they are not sheared apart by the vertical rollers of the tax      stamping machines which roll along the vertical walls of the cartons to      transfer the cartons between the various stages of the process. </PAR><PAR>  If two narrow cartons are to be secured together, the means for securement      must allow for later separation of the cartons, if desired, by the      retailer or consumer. For marketing purposes, once separated, the two      cartons should have little or no trace of the means for securement which      would disfigure the outward appearance of the cartons. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It is therefore an object of this invention to provide for the capability      of manufacturing and distributing cartons narrower than those processed by      existent tax-stamping machinery common to distributors, without requiring      customized tax-stamping machinery or hand stamping of the packs. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of this invention to provide a means for securing      two narrow cartons together to form a dual carton such that the two      cartons do not move relative to one another while being transferred      throughout the tax-stamping machinery designed to process cigarette      cartons having the dimensions of the dual carton. </PAR><PAR>  It is still another object of this invention to provide a means for making      a clean separation between the two narrow cartons if desired for sale as      individual cartons instead of as a dual carton composed of two narrow      cartons. </PAR><PAR>  These and other objects of the invention are accomplished in accordance      with the principles of the invention by providing both adhesive and      carrier means bearing adhesive to securely connect two narrow cartons,      such as five-pack cartons, together to have the final combined dimensions      of a dual carton, such as a ten-pack carton, which may be passed through      commercially available tax-stamping machinery. The adhesive is selected so      that it leaves no tacky residue after separation of the joined surfaces.      The carrier means is designed to allow for the separation of the two      narrow cartons, if desired, for individual sale, without leaving unsightly      residue which may negatively effect marketability. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  Further features of the invention, its nature, and various advantages will      be more apparent from the accompanying drawings and the following detailed      description of the preferred embodiments wherein like reference characters      represent like elements throughout, and in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a plan view of an illustrative carton blank for a five-pack      carton in accordance with this invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is an exploded isometric view of two five-pack carton blanks      positioned adjacent one another in preparation for connection to each      other to form a ten-pack carton in accordance with this invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is an isometric view of two completely formed five-pack cartons      joined to form a ten-pack carton, before cigarette packs are inserted into      the cartons; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is an isometric view of two completely formed five-pack cartons      joined to form a ten-pack carton with the top flaps of each five-pack      carton lapped over the tops of the two cartons; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is an isometric view of two completely formed five-pack cartons      joined to form a ten-pack cartons with the top flaps of each five pack      carton tucked into their respective cartons; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a bottom plan view of two five-pack cartons connected, in      accordance with this invention, with carrier means bearing indicia for      price coding; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a schematic representation of the steps involved in forming a      ten-pack carton from two five-pack carton blanks in accordance with this      invention; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is schematic representation of the steps involved in forming a      ten-pack carton from two five-pack carton blanks in accordance with this      invention, the blanks oriented differently than in the representation of      FIG. 7. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 1, blank 100, used for forming a carton adapted to hold      one row of five cigarette packs, i.e., a five-pack, has a plurality of      fold lines represented by broken lines. Blank 100 is preferably formed      from a substantially rigid material such as paperboard. Each relatively      large panel 10 and 12 of blank 100 is substantially five times the width      of a long wall of a cigarette pack to be enclosed therein. As used herein,      a standard cigarette pack is defined as any pack commonly used for holding      a predetermined number of cigarettes, and generally having front and back      long walls connected by two short side walls (each pack usually containing      twenty cigarettes). Panel 10 may optionally include cut out portion 11      which causes panel 10 to be slightly shorter than panel 12 to facilitate      removal of cigarette packs which will be contained in the completed      carton. When blank 100 is folded along respective fold lines 10a and 12a,      panel 10 will become the front wall of the carton and panel 12 will become      the rear wall of the carton. Joining panels 10 and 12 is a bottom panel      14, which will form the bottom wall of the carton when the blank is folded      into a carton. Panel 16, having substantially the same dimensions as      bottom panel 14, extends from rear panel 12. After walls 10 and 12 are      assembled, panel 16 is folded along fold line 16a over the top of the      carton to extend between walls 10 and 12 of the carton. Extension panel 18      joins panel 16 along a fold line 18a. Additional fold lines, similar to      fold lines 10a, 12a, 16a and 18a, are located on blank 100, but are not      individually labeled. </PAR><PAR>  Panels 16 and 18 together form a top and tuck-in flap 17. When the carton      is formed and is ready for consumer purchase, extension panel 18      preferably lies substantially parallel to front wall 10, preferably inside      the carton, and panel 16 is folded over the top of the carton towards      front wall 10. Side panels 20a and 20b are folded one over the other to      form a side wall 20 of the carton. Side panels 22a and 22b are folded in a      similar fashion to form side wall 22. The &quot;a&quot; panel is preferably folded      over the &quot;b&quot; panel. Tabs 24 and 26 are preferably folded perpendicular to      panel 14 before the side panels are folded and will eventually lie      substantially parallel to side walls 20 and 22, respectively. The distance      between panels 10 and 12 of the completed carton is substantially the same      as the distance between the two front and back long walls of a cigarette      pack to be enclosed therein. </PAR><PAR>  Blank 100 has an inner surface and an outer surface. When blank 100 is      formed into a carton, the inner surface of the blank is that which faces      the cigarette packs placed inside the completed carton, and the outer      surface of the blank is that which faces outward and is readily visible.      The outer surface of the blank generally bears printed information such as      the brand name and quantity of the contents of the carton. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 reveals two partially folded blanks 100, 100 for five-pack cartons      positioned adjacent one another in preparation for connection to each      other. It will be appreciated that panels 20a, 20b, 22a, 22b, and tabs 24      and 26 have been omitted from the drawing only for the sake of clarity,      and are not intended to be excluded from the invention as depicted. </PAR><PAR>  The blanks are joined along the upper edge of the outer surfaces of their      interior front walls 10 with adhesive 50. Adhesive 50 is preferably a      tack/no-tack adhesive such as a releasable, pressure-sensitive adhesive.      Releasable, pressure-sensitive adhesive is herein defined as any adhesive      known in the art which, preferably, is clear, has no taste or odor, and      does not cause fiber pull or leave a tacky residue once the surfaces      joined by the adhesive are separated (e.g., adhesive which provides a      strong bond between surfaces, but once the surfaces are pulled apart, the      bonds of the adhesive are broken and the adhesive is no longer tacky). </PAR><PAR>  The blanks are further joined along the outer surfaces of their bottom      walls 14 with a carrier means bearing adhesive, such as a sticker 42. The      adhesive on sticker 42 may either be a releasable adhesive with similar      properties as glue 50, or a permanent adhesive such as any permanent      adhesive known in the art. Sticker 42 may also include a frangible means      such as perforated line 41 to facilitate a clean and simple separation of      the two cartons. A weakened line such as line 41 is particularly helpful      if permanent adhesive is used on sticker 42. </PAR><PAR>  The completed, connected cartons 30, 32 are shown in FIG. 3, with their      flaps 17 open. The cartons now are ready for the insertion of two rows of      five cigarette packs per row. After the cigarette packs are inserted,      flaps 17 may be lapped one over the other, such as shown in FIG. 4, in      preparation to be shipped to a distributor and later opened for      tax-stamping. After tax-stamping, flaps 17 may be lapped, once again or,      alternatively, may be tucked into their respective cartons, instead, as      shown in FIG. 5, for distribution to individual wholesalers or retailers.      In the position shown in FIG. 5, panels 16 extend across the tops of their      respective cartons, 30, 32, and panels 18 lie substantially parallel to      their respective front walls 10. </PAR><PAR>  Because the &quot;a&quot; panels of blank 100 are preferably folded over the &quot;b&quot;      panels (panels 20a, 22a, 20b, and 22b shown in FIG. 1), the free edge of      each of the &quot;a&quot; panels of the side walls faces inwardly, i.e., the free      edges lie adjacent interior walls 11, when cartons 30, 32 are joined. In      this configuration, the free edges of the &quot;a&quot; panels are not readily      accessible and thus are relatively safe from being accidentally lifted      from their place adjacent the &quot;b&quot; panels. </PAR><PAR>  Sticker 42 may optionally bear Universal Product Code (U.P.C.) indicia or      other pricing indicia, (e.g., pricing bar code), such as seen on sticker      42a, in FIG. 6. The indicia are positioned such that they are rendered      unreadable by automatic scanning equipment upon separating the cartons,      such as described in copending, commonly assigned patent application Ser.      No. 07/792,617, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.      Sticker 42a is placed along the bottom walls 14 of cartons 30, 32.      Optional frangible means such as perforated line 41 may be included on      sticker 42a, positioned substantially parallel to the adjacent edges of      the walls across which sticker 42a is placed. In the embodiment having      pricing indicia, the lines of the pricing bar code are preferably      positioned substantially parallel to frangible means 41. Similar pricing      indicia may be located on the outer surfaces of front walls 10 of the      cartons. Such indicia either may be printed directly on the walls or may      be printed on labels or stickers positioned on the walls. The readily      visible indicia printed on sticker 42a are preferably coded for sale of      the combined ten-pack carton and are rendered unreadable by automatic      scanning equipment by automatic scanning equipment upon tearing the      sticker 42 to separate the two five-pack cartons. The not readily visible      indicia on front walls 10 are preferably coded for sale of the individual      five-pack cartons, and can be scanned only after separating the dual      carton into individual cartons. </PAR><PAR>  The preferred steps taken in constructing the dual carton formed from      cartons 30, 32 are illustrated but not limited to those shown in FIG. 7 or      8. In the method shown in FIG. 7, two stacks A, B of blanks 100 are      positioned substantially perpendicular to one another. A single blank 100      from each stack is drawn from the stack, in step I, and connected with      adhesive 50 along the outer surfaces of the front panels 10 of the two      blanks 100. Each blank preferably bears printed matter on its outer      surface, and may optionally bear pricing indicia, such as U.P.C. indicia,      on the outer surface of panel 10. The blanks are positioned one on top of      the other, in step II, so that the borders of the two blanks are aligned      with each other. In step III, rear wall 12 of the upper blank is folded      along fold line 10a to be perpendicular to the lower blank. This step is      completed in step IV, so that panels 12 lie in the same plane, with bottom      walls 14 lying between panels 12 in the same plane as panels 12. Both      panels 10 of the two blanks are now perpendicular to the remaining panels      of the blanks. Sticker 42, which optionally bears pricing indicia such as      U.P.C. indicia, is placed across the outer surfaces of panels 14 in step      V. The two blanks are now rotated 90.degree. and, as seen in step VI,      cigarette bundle 34, composed of two rows of five cigarette packs 36 per      row, are positioned by cigarette pack pushing equipment 38 into the nearly      completed dual carton. Once the cigarette packs are in place, the      remaining panels of the blanks may be folded to complete the two cartons,      as seen in step VII It will be appreciated that panels 20a, 20b, 22a, and      22b, and tabs 24 and 26 have been omitted from the drawings only for the      sake of clarity, and are not intended to be excluded from the blanks used      in the steps depicted. </PAR><PAR>  The orientation of the stacks A, B of blanks 100, which are substantially      identical to those shown in FIG. 7, may be modified as seen in FIG. 8,      such that, in step I, the blanks are positioned parallel to one another,      oriented as stack A in FIG. 7. The blanks are positioned against one      another, in step I, as in FIG. 7 and similarly connected with adhesive 50.      In step II panels 12 and 14 are folded perpendicular to panels 10, and      sticker 42, which optionally bears pricing indicia such as U.P.C. indicia,      is positioned across the outer surfaces of panels 14. The blanks are      rotated such that step III and step IV are substantially identical to step      VI and step VII, respectively, of FIG. 7. </PAR><PAR>  Although sticker 42 is shown placed across bottom walls 14, sticker 42, or      additional stickers similar to sticker 42, may be placed across side walls      20 or 22 or both. Additionally, a transparent band of material, such as      common in the art, may be wrapped around the cartons to further secure      them together. </PAR><PAR>  It will be appreciated that sticker 42 may or may not bear U.P.C. or other      pricing indicia (which preferably bear coding for sale of the dual      carton). If such indicia are included, the sticker bearing such indicia      may be used in combination with any or all of the disclosed stickers. Such      indicia are situated such that the coding for ten-pack sale is rendered      unreadable by automatic scanning equipment upon separation of cartons 30,      32. Furthermore, such indicia may be located on a sticker placed across      any pair of adjacent coplanar walls as desired. Preferably only one      sticker bearing pricing indicia is used. </PAR><PAR>  Although flaps 17, designed to be tucked into cartons 30, 32, are shown, it      will be appreciated that any appropriate flap may be used, such as a flap      with portion 16 without extension 18, intended to be lapped over the top      of the carton, but not tucked partially inside the carton. </PAR><PAR>  Although extension panel 18 is described as tucked inside the carton,      extension panel 18 may alternatively be secured to the outside of the      carton. </PAR><PAR>  Although cartons 30, 32 are described as each dimensioned to hold one row      of five cigarette packs, they may be lengthened or shortened to hold more      or fewer than five packs. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that these      concepts may be applied to the connection of cartons of other      configurations for which distributors commonly have tax-stamping      machinery. </PAR><PAR>  It will be appreciated that references to cigarette cartons and cigarette      packs are not limited to only rectangular cartons and packs, but are      intended to include all configurations which are available to consumers.      Cigarette cartons include cartons with windows, cartons with rounded      edges, and other configurations which are designed to be passed through      tax-stamping equipment. Cigarette packs include such packs as oval packs,      packs with rounded edges, and other non-rectangular shapes. </PAR><PAR>  It will be appreciated that references to tax-stamping machinery are      intended to include any existing equipment which is readily available to      distributors, and modified versions. </PAR><PAR>  It will be appreciated that panels 10 may have a cutout portion 11 of any      desired depth, including no depth at all, i.e., without any cutout      portion. </PAR><PAR>  Although adhesive 50 is shown along the top edge of panels 10, adhesive 50      may be positioned along other portions of panels 10 such that adhesive 50      is not readily visible when cartons 30, 32 are connected to each other. </PAR><PAR>  It will be understood that the foregoing is merely illustrative of the      principles of the invention, and that various modifications can be made by      those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of      the invention. The present embodiments are described for the purpose of      illustration rather than limitation, and the present invention is limited      only by the claims which follow. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
