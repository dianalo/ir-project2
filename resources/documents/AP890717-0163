(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Richard Dortch, Jim Bakker's former topdeputy, and not former Bakker aides David and James Taggart actuallyran PTL during its heyday, defense witnesses testified Monday.   PTL founder Bakker ``had agreed to turn the reins over toDortch,'' Charlotte attorney John York testified. ``In myexperience, David (Taggart) was never a power figure. He was just amouthpiece for Jim.''   York, a member of the law firm that served as PTL's generalcounsel, was one of the first witnesses called by defense attorneysfor the Taggart brothers. The Taggarts are charged with evading$487,000 in income taxes during their years at PTL.   Prosecutors say the two men diverted $1.1 million in ministryfunds to their own use.   York and the former assistant secretary to the PTL board saidDortch wielded much of the authority at PTL.   Dortch, York said, once ordered him to leave a PTL board meetingjust before bonuses for ministry executives were discussed.   Sylvia Watson, who served as the assistant board secretary in theearly 1980s, said she resigned in 1982 after Dortch ordered her tostop writing into the minutes who made the motion to pay bonuses.   York said he once met with David Taggart and outside accountantswho were auditing PTL when Taggart explained that he took large cashadvances on ministry credit cards because he served as the ``bank''when the Bakkers traveled.   Don Hardister, who was Bakker's bodyguard for seven years,testified that David Taggart once carried $25,000 in a briefcase ona trip with the Bakkers.   ``You've got to realize there were 10 to 15 people who weregetting expenses from that money,'' said Hardister, one of sevendefense witnesses to testify Monday afternoon. ``I got $5,000 to$7,000 of that amount for my staff.''   Bakker, Hardister said, lived an opulent lifestyle and insistedon carrying $1,000 in cash in his billfold at all times. He said itwas Taggart's responsibility to make sure Bakker always had 10 $100bills.   The prosecution's final witness, Internal Revenue Service agentCharles Mauney, said David and James Taggart used $150,000 in cashadvances on PTL credit cards and $140,000 in ministry checks fortheir personal expenses in 1985.   Mauney said the government did not challenge an additional$320,000 in questionable PTL payments made to the brothers in 1984and 1985.   For 1984, Mauney testified, the Taggarts did not pay any taxes on$48,000 in additional income. The goverment decided not to challenge$208,000 on cash advances on PTL credit cards, PTL checks used topay off the defendants' personal credit card accounts and the use ofPTL credit cards to purchase personal items.   Mauney said the Taggarts had $523,354 in unreported taxableincome in 1986 and $260,000 in 1987.   He testified the total unreported taxable income for the twobrother was $1.2 million ffrom 1984 to 1987. David Taggart owed$264,911 in back taxes; James Taggart owed $260,576.   The Taggart brothers joined PTL in the late 1970s as pianoplayers. Within a few years, David Taggart, 32, was promoted toBakker's top personal aide and James Taggart, 35, became PTL'sinterior decorator.   Both were fired when Jerry Falwell took over at the televisionministry following Bakker's resignation in March 1987 followingrevelations of the Jessica Hahn sex-and-money scandal.   Beginning July 5, testimony from dozens of New York shopkeepersand friends of the Taggarts showed the defendants went on spendingsprees in the most exclusive stores in New York, Florida, Californiaand Europe.   Prosecutors charge the Taggarts also used money donated to thetax-exempt ministry to buy a $640,000 condominium in New York'sexclusive Trump Tower.   If convicted, the Taggarts each could be sentenced to 25 years inprison and face fines totaling more than $1 million.   Bakker and Dortch are scheduled to go on trial in Charlotte onAug. 28 on 24 counts of wire and mail fraud and conspiracy.</TEXT></DOC>
