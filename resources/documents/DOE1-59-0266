<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-59-0266 </DOCNO><TEXT>A three-barrel repeating pneumatic pellet injector has been developedfor plasma fueling of the Joint European Torus (JET) tokamak. The versatiledevice consists of three independent machine-gun-like mechanisms thatoperate at cryogenic temperatures (10--20 K). Individual extruders providea continuous supply of solid hydrogen isotope to each gun assembly, wherea reciprocating breech-side cutter forms and chambers cylindrical pelletsfrom the extrusion; the deuterium pellets are then accelerated in thegun barrels with compressed hydrogen gas (pressures up to 105 bar) tovelocities {le}1.5 km/s. The injector features three nominal pellet sizes(2.7, 4.0, and 6.0 mm) and repetitive operation (5, 2.5, and 1 Hz, respectively)for quasi-steady-state conditions (andgt;10 s). The design allows the gunbarrels to be aligned mechanically for accurate aiming. A remote stand-alonecontrol and data acquisition system is used for injector operation. Theinjector system has been installed on JET. The design features, operation,and performance characteristics of the injector are described.</TEXT></DOC>
