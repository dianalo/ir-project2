The ground workers, who include baggage handlers and mechanics, have been in a legal position to strike since midnight on Tuesday. Contract negotiations between Air Canada and the union, the International Airline Machinists and Aerospace Workers, broke off Tuesday.    The union hasn't said when it will start its strike but has indicated that it will initially use rotating strikes. The union has promised to give 24-hour notice before a strike, said an Air Canada spokesman.    The union reached a tentative agreement with Air Canada in September for a new two-year pact that would result in wage increases of 4% in each year, but it was rejected by union members. The union is now seeking a 7.2% wage boost in the first year.    The average hourly wage on June 28, when the last contract expired, was 15.03 Canadian dollars ($11.36).    A union spokesman wasn't available for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
