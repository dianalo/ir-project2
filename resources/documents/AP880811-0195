Donna Fitzpatrick, associate undersecretary of energy, said moreresearch was needed before acting to curb production of theatmospheric gases that scientists say are changing the Earth'sclimate.   ``Significant gaps exist in our knowledge of the greenhouseeffect _ gaps that must be filled if we are to address the concernsraised by potential climate change in a scientifically supportablemanner,'' she said.   ``These scientific uncertainties must be reduced before wecommit the nation's economic future to drastic and potentiallymisplaced policy responses,'' Fitzpatrick testified.   Her statements to the Senate Energy and Natural ResourcesCommittee echoed stands taken previously by Reagan administrationwitnesses testifying before congressional hearings on the dangersposed to mankind by global warming.   But Stephen Schneider, a climatologist from the National Centerfor Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., testified that ``weshould not use platitudes about scientific uncertainty as an excusefor inaction. ...   ``There's a (scientific) concern that we are assaulting theenvironment much faster than we are understanding it,'' saidSchneider, characterizing the administration position as``political value judgments, not scientific opinions.''   ``More research will certainly put policy making on a firmerscientific basis ... but it is my opinion that credible detailsabout specific `winners and losers' will not be available before wemay have committed ourselves to potentially dangerous, largeatmospheric changes,'' said Schneider, who works for a consortiumof universities.   He and government scientists at the hearing repeated warnings,which have been made more dramatic by this year's searingtemperatures and drought, that emissions of gases like carbondioxide and methane are trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere.   Scientists have not directly linked the summer of 1988 to thegreenhouse effect, but they say the steamy weather and crop lossesare just some of the problems people can expect in the future.   Greenhouse gases come from a variety of sources, from theburning of fossil fuels like coal, production of chemicals likeclorofluorocarbons, the escape of huge amounts of methane from ricepaddies and the release of carbon dioxide from the destruction offorests.   In congressional hearings, there has been general scientificagreement that continued emissions of such gases will cause adestructive rise in temperatures and ocean levels. The differencesoccur over when, where and how severe the changes will be.   Some scientists have warned that even if the world reduced itsproduction of greenhouse gases, those already in the atmospherealready will cause the planet in 30 years to 50 years to have itshighest temperatures in 10,000 years.   Officials from the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, Environmental Protection Agency and NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration told Thursday's hearings ofgreenhouse research in their agencies.   They stopped short of seconding Fitzpatrick's stand that nothingshould be done to combat greenhouse gas production until morescientific certainty is attained.   Schneider, saying that ``high-leverage actions are longoverdue,'' called for steps that would combat greenhouse gaseswhile attacking other environmental problems such as acid rain,low-level ozone pollution and destruction of the stratosphericozone layer by chlorofluorocarbons.   He said his first priority would be greater energy efficiencyand conservation to reduce emissions from power plants andvehicles. No step, he said, should be considered too small becauseslowing down the greenhouse effect ``makes good sense.''</TEXT></DOC>
