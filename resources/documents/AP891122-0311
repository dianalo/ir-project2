The participation of the pilots has been a crucial element ofthe walkout begun by the airline's Machinist union members, andlater joined by the pilots and Eastern flight attendants.   The Eastern pilots union voted at a meeting in Reston, Va., toabandon their picket lines the day after President Bush vetoedlegislation that would set up a blue-ribbon commission toinvestigate the dispute.   In his veto message, Bush said Congress, which would haveconducted the investigation, had no business interfering in thecontract and court disputes over the strike.   A statement released by the Air Line Pilots Association said thepilots voted to call off their strike in sympathy with theMachinists and return to work. But Eastern officials have replacedmany of the 2,250 striking pilots with non-union fliers and havesaid there would be few if any jobs for the strikers to return to.   ``It's a very interesting development,'' Miami-based Easternsaid in a statement. ``Our only regret is that it didn't comeearlier and we could have avoided all the trauma that has come toEastern Airlines.''   There currently are no openings for pilots at the airline, whichnow has about 1,800 fliers, the company said. But it indicatedthere could be slots in the future, which would be filled in theorder in which pilots returned to work _ except in cases wherepilots with experience on specific types of aircraft are needed.   Eastern said striking pilots ``will be recalled as jobs comeopen in the future'' and invited them to sign the recall list.   ``The strike continues for us,'' John Peterpaul, vice presidentof the International Association of Machinists, said in a telephoneinterview late Wednesday. ``What they (the pilots) do is theiraffair. ... We're not calling this thing off.''   Peterpaul said there is a fairly good chance that Congress willbe able to override the president's veto. That action, whichcongressional sponsors of the measure have promised, can't comeuntil Congress reconvenes in two months.   Technically, under the Railway Labor Act, which governs airlinescontract disputes, only the Machinists are on strike. The pilotsand flight attendants have been honoring Machinist picket lines inlegal sympathy strikes.   There were only about 2,250 Eastern pilots on strike as ofWednesday, according to ALPA, down from 3,600 when the strike beganon March 4.   The pilots had been the linchpin of the strike, surprisingmanagement when they joined Eastern's Machinists in a sympathywalkout. The pilots, who are more difficult to replace, wielded farmore economic clout than the Machinists and flight attendants theyjoined on the picket lines. That made the strike far morethreatening.   Back in March, the decision of the pilots _ the elite amongunion members _ to join the working-class Machinists strike dealtthe crushing blow to Eastern, which already was suffering fromfinancial losses and longtime labor-management tensions.   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., putEastern under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 9, fivedays after the strike began. Since then, Lorenzo and his managementteam have been hiring replacement workers and rebuilding Eastern asa smaller carrier.   ``They've got all the pilots they need,'' Paul Karos, an airlineanalyst at First Boston Corp., said Wednesday. ``The strike hasbeen mainly symbolic.''   ``Pilot power'' was a key element in the early months of thewalkout, as the national pilots union threatened countrywide jobactions in solidarity with the Eastern fliers and the pilots'attorneys argued forcefully against the company in federalbankruptcy court.   The strength of the pilots' ranks eroded, however, as thegrueling strike wore on.   The crucial turning point came in August, when Eastern pilotsvoted by a wide margin to continue the strike but several hundredfliers crossed picket lines and returned to work.   As the pilots still on strike increasingly were stripped to theradical core of the group, their leadership was changed. JackBavis, chairman of the Eastern pilots' executive council, wasrecalled by union leaders and replaced by Skip Copeland, a 27-yearEastern veteran considered a hard-liner on the strike and far lessconciliatory than Bavis.   ``The strike has, for all intents and purposes, been over,''said Louis Marckesano, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.in Philadelphia. ``It doesn't have much purpose anymore.''</TEXT></DOC>
