A presidential commission also will look into the charges madein court documents by Pan American World Airways, said Sens. FrankLautenberg, D-N.J., and Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., both members ofthe commission on aviation security.   Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., at a news conference Thursday withthe senators and victims' relatives, said members of her staff willtravel to Bonn and Frankfurt with relatives of some of the 270people killed in the Dec. 21 terrorist bombing over Lockerbie,Scotland.   She said staff members would meet with German officials, FederalAviation Administration security personnel in Europe and airportsecurity officers in Frankfurt where the flight originated.   The flight, crowded with Americans returning to the UnitedStates for the Christmas holidays, went from Frankfurt to London,where passengers switched to another plane for the final leg to NewYork.   Bert Ammerman, spokesman for victims' families, said thegovernment showed ``negligent disregard for airport and airlinesecurity and terrorism and a lax response'' to the bombing.   The seven-member commission on air terrorism will look into PanAm's allegations that the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad warnedU.S. authorities of a possible attack 36 hours before the crash,said Lautenberg and D'Amato.   They said the commission also will investigate Pan Am'scontention that West Germany's investigative agency reported``suspicious activities'' at the Frankfurt airport baggage loadingarea within 90 minutes of the flight's departure.   The commission, which includes members of Congress and others,was formed to look into the bombing.   Lautenberg said he had no information to verify or disprove thenew allegations. The airline, facing $300 million in lawsuits overthe bombing, wants a court order for documents and interviews atthe CIA and other U.S. agencies, along with any information thegovernment may have about warnings before the flight.   A State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said Wednesdaythe department ``never received any specific and credible threatagainst Pan Am 103.'' British and U.S. authorities have, however,acknowledged general threats against U.S. carriers at the time.   West German authorities said they issued a general warning aboutpossible terrorist attacks the month before the bombing, but deniedthere were late warnings about the specific flight.   Ammerman of River Vale, N.J., whose brother Tom died in thebombing, said relatives were shocked by the Pan Am claims.   ``Needless to say, these reports are appalling,'' Ammerman said.``If they are true, then we could be witnessing the uncovering ofone of the gravest scandals ever to hit our intelligence andsecurity communities.   ``If they are not true,'' he said, ``then they would represent acynical and reprehensible attempt by Pan Am to avoid culpabilityfor this horrendous tragedy.''   Ammerman said that with both the government and the airline,there has been ``too much fiddling going on, while the families ofthe victims burn in our anguish and outrage.''   Investigators have determined the plane was downed by plasticexplosives concealed in a radio-cassette player in the luggagecompartment. The probe is focusing on terrorist groups operating inthe Middle East and Europe, but investigators have not determinedwho put it there.</TEXT></DOC>
