My subject was anOffice of Management and Budget decision not to authorize ahigher ceiling for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's hiringof bank examiners for Sandamp;Ls in the mid-1980s. I testified thatthe OMB decision not to raise the ceiling stemmed from theBank Board's inability, over a period of years, to hire evenas many examiners as its ceiling already afforded. This isestablished in detail in the record of the 2 1/2-hourhearing. In fact, the real reason the board couldn't get moreexaminers was that, by statute, not OMB decision, governmentpay was not competitive.   I did not &quot;acknowledge,&quot; as your reporter writes, that&quot;ideology&quot; was the basis for this decision. Once again, asthe hearing record makes plain, I merely explained that givenpresidential policy to constrain the growth of the federalwork force, the burden of justification for increases restedwith the agency head. The Bank Board could hardly make a casefor a higher ceiling when it was chronically unable to hireat the already authorized ceiling. The words &quot;ideology&quot; and&quot;acknowledge&quot; used by your reporter reveal only his ownideological preconception and his apparent desire to make apersonal political point -- that, somehow, it was Reaganpolicy, not statutory federal pay levels, that made it hardfor the Bank Board to get the examiners it wanted.</LP><TEXT>   Constance Horner   Undersecretary of Health and Human Services   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
