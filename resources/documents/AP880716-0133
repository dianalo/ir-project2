New Education Ministry orders to devote classes to thePalestinian issue breaks with a 40-year tradition begun by Israel'sfirst prime minister, the late David Ben-Gurion. He barred teachersfrom raising topical political issues in school.   As a result, the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict hasnormally not gone beyond the 1967 Middle East War, when Israel waslopsidedly victorious, and usually ignored detailed references tothe Palestinian point of view.   Now, however, students heatedly argue such issues as whetherIsrael should negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organizationor withdraw from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Teachers fear high school pupils who face a compulsory militarydraft at 18 will be emotionally unprepared for army service unlessthey are better educated about the Arab-Israeli conflict.   Another concern is to avoid the swelling of anti-Arab prejudicewhich has grown among Israeli youth in the wake of the Palestinianuprising that began Dec. 8 and has claimed the lives of more than200 Arabs and four Israelis.   ``I've started to think about the Palestinian side of things. ... Now I understand that a state is what they (the Palestinians)need,'' Danny Sirkin, 17, said in a recent discussion in his 11thgrade classroom.   Few students agreed with the Sirkin.   ``If we return the territories, nobody knows if that will bringwar or peace. The PLO wants all of Israel,'' said DoronKapitolnick, 17.   The 40-minute debate was at the Rene Cassin High School, builton a battlefield of the 1967 war when Israel captured the Arabsector of Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan and wrested theGaza Strip from Egyptian control.   Most students said peace talks were needed but maintained Israelshould boycott the PLO, even though Palestinians consider thatgroup to be their only representative.   Other students expressed concern for relatives serving in theoccupied territories.   ``The outside world doesn't understand,'' said Tamar Kater.``They only talk about soldiers beating Arabs. It's not theirfathers or brothers doing army reserve duty.''   Another girl interrupted to say she was afraid to ride buseswith Palestinians because of recent firebomb and rock-throwingattacks in Jerusalem. Others denounced Palestinians as``terrorists.''   Arab pupils at the Palestinian Medhamiya Girls' High School,just a mile down the road from Rene Cassin, never mingle with theJewish students although their schools and homes are near eachother.   At Medhamiya, in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, teacher RandaNusseibeh, a Palestinian, spoke generally about the roots of theArab-Israeli conflict to her 11th graders. She said the UnitedStates and Britain helped Jews create a homeland in Palestine in1948.   ``What colonialism and the Jews want is to create tension in thearea,'' Mrs. Nusseibeh told the class.   After class, pupil Randa Takash told a reporter she wanted theIsraelis to ``go back to where they came from.''   But, in contrast with the Israeli students, the Palestinianstudents did not debate the current problems in the occupiedterritories or what should be done about them.   School officials say Palestinian teachers discuss the uprisingonly indirectly, fearing they could be accused of inciting violenceand their schools would be closed.   In some Israeli classes, pupils have been asked to express theirfeelings by drawing, said Tova Tsur, an adviser at the EducationMinistry who coordinates the program on the Arab-Israeli conflict.   Eighth-graders in one Tel Aviv classroom drew pictures ofsoldiers toting guns or Palestinians wielding knives, Mrs. Tsursaid in an interview.   One drawing, she said, was of an airplane taking off withIsraelis on board. Mrs. Tsur said the drawing dramatized studiesthat indicate many young Israelis want to leave the country.   Mrs. Tsur said a new ministry booklet advises high schoolteachers to assign literature by Palestinian refugees and toinstruct classes that Palestinians like Israelis have ``a strongemotional tie to the Land of Israel.''   But she added that many teachers cited deep emotionalinvolvement in the conflict as one reason they hesitate to complywith government instructions about teaching the Arab-Israeliconflict.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Fri AMs, July 22</NOTE></DOC>
