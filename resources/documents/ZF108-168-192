(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Applications Wave Behind ISDNandM;The wave of the future or washed up technology?andP;  The question inevitablyarises anytime serious consideration is given to Integrated Services DigitalNetwork technology.andP;  More than a decade in the works, ISDN still is in searchof what one supporter calls a killer application that will sweep away anydoubts about the standard's usefulness.andM;Chances are there is no one such application out there.andP;  Instead, severalniche applications may arise to take advantage of the higher speeds and costsavings promised by a standardized global network--enough perhaps to helpreduce doubts about ISDN's viability.andM;Built on top of standard unshielded twisted pair telephone wire, ISDN is anend-to-end digital network that integrates voice, data and images.andP;  It isbroken out into two formats.andP;  The first, Basic Rate Access, consists of two64 kilobits per second B channels for data transmission and one 16Kbps Dchannel.andP;  A D channel provides signaling information for the network.andP;  Thesecond, Primary Rate Access, consists of 23 B channels plus one 64Kbps Dchannel.andM;ISDN's availability is nearly universal at this point, although it costs varywidely.andP;  Prices have fallen to as low as $100 for initial installation of anISDN line and $20 for monthly leasing of such a line.andM;There have been many trial users and even some paying customers of ISDN overthe last few years.andP;  Some of these users have found genuine cost savings oncethey got past the problems associated with the new technology, such as theuneven availability of services and line or equipment bugs.andM;Users' success with ISDN most frequently comes from performing old functionsin a new way, rather than from heading off on an entirely new front.andP;  ISDN,for example, could allow smaller companies wishing to transmit order andpurchase transactions electronically to build electronic data interchange(EDI) networks much more easily.andM;On-Line CollectionandM;When American Creditors Bureau of Phoenix went on line last August, it becamethe first paying customer in Arizona of US West Inc.'s Primary Rate Interfacelines.andP;  &quot;We're not being driven by any data need that's going unfulfilled,&quot;says Bob Alsaker, ACB vice president of information systems.andM;Nevertheless, data applications will find their place in the bureau's ISDNinstallation.andP;  The nationwide bill collection agency is in the process ofinstalling IBM AS/400 systems in 30 different cities.andP;  These systems willneed to communicate with an IBM 4381 mainframe in Phoenix.andP;  Right now, ACBuses a network that transmits data at 9.6Kbps, but it expects to be able toleverage ISDN's 64Kbps potential by receivng and sending information morequickly, possibly at a lower price.andM;On the applications front, ACB is waiting for an ISDN-based automatic numberidentification (ANI) service to become available this year.andP;  ANI displays acallerhs telephone number to a user before the call is answered.andP;  Thatnumber, carried as information over a D channel in the case of an ISDNapplication, can trigger a user's database so that representatives handlingthe call could have caller account information ready before picking up thephone.andP;  In ACB's case, an ANI service would allow the company to discover thelocation of debtors who do not identify themselves.andM;ANI is being trumpeted as a key benefit of ISDN.andP;  But it should not be, saysKenneth Bosomworth, president of International Resource Development Inc., whobelieves ISDN is being misrepresented to users.andP;  ANI, for example, can beoffered without an isdn framework, yet isdn providers often link the two.andM;&quot;The thing to understand,&quot; says Bosomworth, whose New Canaan, Conn., firmspecializes in communications market research, &quot;is that ISDN was neverintended to enable new applications, although probably some will emerge.andP;  Themain point is that this has always been a central office switching standard.&quot;andO;Central office switches, the mammoth machines used by communications carrierssuch as ATandamp;T, MCI Communications Corp. and local telephone companies, areprimarily for routing calls and creating new telecom services likecall-waiting.andP;  Advances in technology like ISDN used to run these switches donot translate directly into gains for information systems users.andM;&quot;The carriers are promoting ISDN.andP;  I don't see end users promoting it,&quot;agrees Walter Ulrich, client services director for Arthur D. Little Inc., amanagement consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.andP;  But he sees no harm in thecarriers bundling the concepts of ISDN with other services if users manage toimprove operations because of them.andM;Shell Oil Co., for example, has cut anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds off eachof the 200,000 calls it receives monthly on its 800 number by using anISDN-based ANI system.andP;  The 800 number is used by Shell customers to makebilling inquiries.andP;  Those unspent seconds translate into savings of roughly$30,000 to $40,000 per month, according to Billy King, formerly projectcoordinator for Shell's ISDN conversion project and now senior applicationsmanager for VADIS Inc. VADIS, in Richardson, Texas, supplies add-in PC boardsthat allow desktop systems to use ISDN services.andM;ISDN also can make a difference in ANI-equipped telemarketing operations.andO;&quot;For companies who make money answering phones, ISDN will make an impact onthe number of phones they can answer and how much data they have when theydo,&quot; says John Hart, director of telecommunications industry marketing forStratus Computer Inc. of Marlborough, Mass.andP;  The fault-tolerant computermaker sells its systems for transaction-intensive applications such astelemarketing.andM;Let the Other Guy ExperimentandM;Yet confusion and distrust about ISDN is still common among users, says JohnAmidon, manager of technical support for the Arizona Department ofTransportation.andP;  This Phoenix-based agency was one of the earliest ISDN testsites when it received its first ISDN call back in November 1986.andP;  Its trialswith ISDN involved such applications as image-equipped telephones andinteractive programming for data entry.andM;&quot;Most of the users are saying 'I'll let him over there try it.andP;  If he gets itto work, fine.'andP;  There's too much of that.andP;  People don't want to take therisk.andP;  But today you have to do that,&quot; says Amidon.andM;But it turns out that some of the risk-takers are nay-sayers.andP;  GeneralElectric Co. in Bridgeport, Conn., recently began an ISDN trial.andP;  Thepurpose, according to Jeff Sharp, GE program manager for telecommunicationsevaluation, is to see what value there is in the technology.andP;  So far, he'skind of stumped.andM;&quot;We did look at a few data applications,&quot; remarks Sharp, citing the abilityto connect local area networks (LANs) together as one.andP;  &quot;My job was to findsomeone who could use it, and I wasn't successful at this site.&quot;andP;  Thus, heconcludes, &quot;Right now, if we had to vote to implement ISDN, we would voteno.&quot;andM;Technology does not always translate into applications, and ISDN technologydoes not surpass the communications mechanisms that GE already has in place,such as LANs and fiber-optic networks.andP;  Sharp defines ISDN as the first threelayers of the seven-layer Open Systems Interconnection standard ofinternational communications--the physical, data and network layers.andP;  ThusISDN represents physical connectivity.andP;  It's not until you get to layer seventhat the OSI model mentions applications.andP;  When defined that way, ISDN is toolittle too late as a solution to most of GE's data communications needs.andP;  Thehigher speeds of today's local area networks and the spreading use of fiberoptics can make ISDN a little dated.andM;Sharp sees one possible application--allowing off-site GE employees totransfer files to the office at 64Kbps (ISDN speed).andP;  But, in reality, Sharpsees little chance that the application could really be feasible.andP;  At lastcount, there were more than 2,000 GE sites listed in U.S.andP;  phone books and anuntold number of GE employees who communicate from their homes or on theroad.andP;  &quot;The catch-22,&quot; according to Sharp, &quot;is that ISDN is not economicalfor the telephone companies to offer to individual subscribers.andP;  So, instead,the telecos are going after the large corporations who have other means ofcommunications at their disposal.&quot;andM;Where ISDN Is a Good CallandM;Others are sympathetic to Sharp's plight but believe they've found some areaswhere ISDN does fit.andP;  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore,Calif., no slouch in the networking arena, is already way beyond ISDN speeds,looking at communications products for its supercomputers capable oftransmitting information in gigabytes.andP;  But it cut over to ISDN in November1989 mainly to save money on voice communications.andP;  Prior to installing ISDN,the lab's 15,000 phone lines were each tariffed separately; now they arepriced as a group and are therefore considerably less costly.andM;Gregory Suski, a project manager at Lawrence Livermore, acknowledges thatISDN will not make a dent with the heavy data users on its Ethernet backbonenetwork.andP;  But he says it is a boon for the lab's 1,600 casual modem users.andO;&quot;If I told one of my high-speed users to go back to Basic Rate, I'd have arevolt on my hands,&quot; comments Suski.andP;  &quot;But for those used to 1,200 [bps]access to computers on site because we haven't strung the right cable,getting to a higher speed [of ISDN] is great.&quot;andM;Thus it's solving the prosaic needs of users rather than delivering anyhigh-profile application that's helping sell ISDN.andP;  Such is the case withTenneco Gas, a Houston-based division of Tenneco Inc.andP;  It began installing2,300 ISDN lines in the summer of 1988 chiefly to improve voicecommunications.andP;  But telecommunications section manager Russell Royacknowledges that data uses of Tenneco's ISDN lines are cropping up.andM;Calling All ModemsandM;&quot;We're implementing a system so that all PCs are connected to the ISDNsystem,&quot; Roy says.andP;  &quot;We've set up a modem pool for about 1,000 PCs.andP;  We wouldhave needed 1,000 modems previously.andP;  Now we just need about 50 modems.&quot;andP;  Thesavings in modem costs, accompanied by speeds much higher than the 1,200 or2,400bps typical of modems, has sold Roy on ISDN's virtues.andM;The savings from using standard telephone wire instead of more expensivecoaxial cable have persuaded the Arizona Department of Transportation to lookfavorably on ISDN.andP;  Two years after the technology trial, Amidon believes thestate has just about overcome the budgetary and management issues that havedelayed the decision to move ahead with a commercial grade installation ofISDN.andM;&quot;Technology has to crawl before it can walk,&quot; believes Paris Burstyn,director of telecommunications research for the Business Research Group inNewton, Mass., a subsidiary of Cahners Publishing Co., publishers ofDATAMATION.andP;  &quot;We first have to get a groundswell based on basic applicationsand then get the experience to develop new ones.&quot;andM;And that groundswell is building, according to Stratus' Hart.andP;  Sure,connecting LANs with each other, automatic number identification and the likeare all typical ISDN implementations right now.andP;  &quot;In and of themselves, thesewon't drive ISDN into reality,&quot; says Hart.andP;  &quot;What will are money-makingapplications.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
