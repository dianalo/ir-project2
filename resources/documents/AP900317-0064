ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Yellowed drawings from Henri Matisse'ssketchbook in Morocco, many of them unknown to art scholars fornearly 80 years, will be displayed publicly for the first timeSunday at the National Gallery of Art.   The exhibition of paintings and drawings by the Frenchpost-impressionist during two visits to Morocco also represents abreakthrough in U.S.-Soviet cultural collaboration, says gallerydirector J. Carter Brown.   It is the first exhibition mounted jointly by U.S. and Sovietcurators from beginning to end, he said, with contributions fromthe Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow and the Hermitage Museumin Leningrad.   The show contains 23 Matisse paintings, more than half neverexhibited in the United States, and 47 drawings whose existence waslargely unknown until their discovery during a three-year search ofprivate collections scattered throughout Europe.   Matisse spent several months in 1912 and 1913 exploring theexotic streets and cafes of Tangier in search of new artisticthemes. Many of his 25 Moroccan paintings were quickly purchased byMoscow art collectors Ivan Morosov and Sergei Shchukin, and woundup in Soviet museums.   His drawings were dispersed among family members, friends andprivate collectors in Europe and forgotten.   Jack Cowart, curator of 20th century art at the NationalGallery, said his curatorial team's ``voyage of discovery''uncovered a bonanza of 67 Matisse drawings from Morocco.   One of the sketches, a view of Tangier from the window ofMatisse's hotel, joined the exhibition Monday night after a flightfrom France.   Its existence was confirmed in a telephone call to Matissescholar Pierre Schneider by the granddaughter of the formerproprietor of the Hotel Villa de France, where Matisse stayed inTangier.   In all, the curators uncovered a bonanza of 67 Matisse drawingsfrom Morocco. Of the 47 being displayed at the gallery, all butthree have never been exhibited before. Cowart refuses to say wherethe newly discovered drawings were found.   All of Matisse's paintings from that pivotal period in hisartistic career are in the show except for two. One is extremelyfragile and cannot leave the Hermitage Museum. The other is held bythe Barnes Foundation near Philadelphia under terms that forbid itspublic display.   Brown said the exhibition represents ``not only one of the mostdazzling moments in 20th century art but also new chapters in thestudy of Matisse's art and in the cooperation of museums andscholars of east and west.''   Cowart said Soviet art officials had expressed interest in late1987 in collaborating on a joint exhibition, instead of merelyagreeing on an even swap of pictures.   Over lunch at the National Gallery a few months later, Cowartsaid, the Soviet ministry of culture officially expressed interestand Brown ``turned over the Matisse-Morocco card.''   ``They instantly said yes, right, let's get on with it,'' Cowartsaid, and the joint venture was sealed.   The exhibition will run at the National Gallery through June 3.It will appear at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, whichhelped organize the show, from June 24 through Sept. 4. It willtravel to Moscow for an appearance at the Pushkin Museum from Sept.28 through Nov. 20, and to the Hermitage from Dec. 15 through Feb.15, 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
