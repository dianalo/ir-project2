The arrangement is made so that the heat exchangeris embedded in a graphite side reflector spaced from and parallel tothe core. This has various advantages. The whole hot side of the primarycircuit can be fitted inside the graphite components, which means thatone can dispense with large penetrations through the pressure vesselto the outside, which are expensive to build and to make safe. Also,due to the embedding of the heat exchanger inside the side reflector,in case of a fault and because of the high thermal conductivity of thegraphite, very effective passive cooling can be maintained.</TEXT></DOC>
