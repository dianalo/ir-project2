Ann Frey, a press officer for the bank, said the loan would bethe first with the bank's support. The usual purpose of its loansand guarantees is to encourage the sale of U.S. goods in othercountries.   She said the proposal went to Congress on Wednesday. If noobjection is raised in 25 days it will go through automatically,she added.   The bank's announcement said that on July 13 the StateDepartment decided that the arms sought by Colombia are primarilyfor use against narcotics and their sale would be in the interestof the United States.   The bank used to be barred from helping the sale of arms. TheAnti-Drug Abuse Act passed last year lifted that ban on sales toThird World countries. This would be the first loan under the newlaw.   Colombia is a major source of cocaine and marijuana used in thiscountry. Guerrilla groups fighting the government sometimes allythemselves with the drug lords and sometimes oppose them. The U.S.law authorizes help to the sale of arms if they are to be usedprimarily against the narcotics trade.   A guarantee by the government bank would enable commercial banksto provide Colombia's Ministry of Defense with a lower interestrate to buy $200 million worth of helicopters, river patrol boats,aeronautical, transport and communications equipment, arms,ammunition and other military items.</TEXT></DOC>
