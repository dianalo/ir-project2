A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standingregulations, said artillery clashes first broke out between theSyrian-backed Amal militia and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Partyof God, at 3:30 a.m. on the northwestern edge of Iqlim al-Tuffah,the Apple Province.   He said by the afternoon fighting raged across an eight-mile,V-shaped front in the disputed province.   ``The whole front is on fire,'' the spokesman said. He said atone point artillery shells were falling at the rate of 20 perminute.   The thud of exploding shells echoed across the region and couldbe heard in Sidon, a provincial capital 25 miles south of Beirut.   Hezbollah said an hour after the shelling started that Amalfighters, backed by guerrillas of Palestine Liberation Organizationchairman Yasser Arafat, launched an attack on its positions in thevillage of Kfar Milki.   Police said the fighting left at least 16 combatants dead and 30wounded.   Kfar Milki, six miles southeast of Sidon, is a strategic hilltopvillage that Hezbollah overran in a major attack across the AppleProvince in January.   The police spokesman said the PLO guerrillas sealed off theregion west of Kfar Milki, preventing policemen and reporters fromwatching the confrontation.   He said, however, that ambulances evacuated four deadPalestinian guerrillas and took 23 wounded to hospitals in nearbySidon.   ``The Palestinians are obviously involved in the fighting, butwe can't establish whether they are taking part in ground attacksor just participating in the shelling duel with Hezbollahgunners,'' the police spokesman said.   A force of about 1,000 guerrillas, drawn mainly from Arafat'smainstream Fatah faction, mans a narrow buffer separating Amal andHezbollah positions in the disputed region.   The buffer extends from Kfar Milki at the region's northwesternedge to the village of Arab Saleem on the southwestern flank.   The Palestinian deployment blocked Hezbollah's advance westtoward the Mediterranean coast and south toward the main Shiitecities.   A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut said the Amal-Palestinianattack was crushed. ``The attackers lost many casualties andwithdrew west,'' the statement said without further elaboration.   The police spokesman, however, said no changes in positions werereported.   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, said a Hezbollah sourcestressed that its fighters were willing to accept a cease-fire toallow the Red Cross to evacuate casualties.   Amal and Hezbollah have been fighting on and off for more thanthree years for control of the 1.2 million Shiites, the largestsect in Lebanon. Nearly 1,200 people have died in the clashes andmore than 4,000 have been wounded.   Amal calls the Hezbollah attacks an ``Iranian invasion,''charging that the 2,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards contingent inLebanon was involved.   The command of the Iranian contingent, in a rare statement,defended its role saying it was aimed only at ``fighting theZionists and defending the Moslems.''   The disputed area is adjacent to the self-designated ``securityzone'' Israel occupies in southern Lebanon.   The Iranian statement, published by the leftist newspaperAs-Safir, called on Amal and Hezbollah to ``end the fighting amongbrethren and unite your guns against the Zionist enemy.''   The Iranian guards came to Lebanon in 1982 with the declaredobjective of taking part in confronting Israel's invading army.They set up headquarters in the eastern Lebanon town of Baalbek andhave since trained most of Hezbollah's fighters.</TEXT></DOC>
