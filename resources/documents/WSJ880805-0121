In a significant display of unity and resolve, leaders of Mexico's three leading opposition parties yesterday made a joint call for the ruling party to either further substantiate its claim of victory in last month's disputed presidential election or annul it. The three opposition leaders also pledged to pursue legislative actions and street demonstrations to prevent president-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari, of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, from taking office on Dec. 1.    The opposition's latest efforts still seem to have little chance of thwarting Mr. Salinas's ascent. But they do mean that tensions are likely to remain high in the coming weeks, as the election result passes through a process of legislative review that traditionally has been only a formality.    &quot;The electoral process hasn't finished,&quot; the opposition statement said. &quot;There is still time for the power of the public to change the course.&quot;    Mr. Salinas was declared winner of the July 6 election with 50.3% of the vote, the ruling party's worst showing in 59 years. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, leader of the leftwing National Democratic Front, received 31.2%. Manuel Clouthier, who heads the conservative National Action Party, or PAN, tallied 17%. Rosario Ibarra de Piedra, of the radical Revolutionary Workers Party received 0.4%. But accusations of electoral fraud have been inflamed by the government's one-week delay in the release of the final results and its failure even now to provide vote tabulations from more than one-third of the 50,000 polling booths.    Officials within the three opposition parties indicated that opposition congressmen will vote as a bloc against ratifying Mr. Salinas's victory once the newly-elected Congress is seated on Sept. 1. The PRI, which holds 260 congressional seats to the opposition's 240, will still have the majority it needs to ratify the election. But a united front by the opposition would put Mr. Salinas in the awkward position of having his victory recognized only by his party. The Democratic Front, which was started by PRI dissidents, is also known to be negotiating with PRI congressmen, in a longshot effort to obtain the majority needed to annul the elections.    Leaders of the opposition parties said they will accompany their legislative efforts with street protests, which will begin to intensify Aug. 15, when the process of ratifying the congressional election results begins. Officials from the leftist Democratic Front and the conservative PAN said there aren't plans for joint demonstrations involving their two parties. If the legislative efforts fail, the opposition parties insist they will intensify street protests.    For the past three weeks, opposition leaders have been heading rallies around the country denouncing Mr. Salinas's victory as illegitimate. Mr. Cardenas's postelection campaign has generated enthusiastic crowds, though he has yet to stray far from the capital and the pockets of the provinces where his support is strongest. Mr. Clouthier's campaign has been less well-received, but the PAN still collected 1.5 million signatures on petitions calling for an annulment.    PRI officials have expressed confidence that the opposition mobilization gradually will subside. The PRI's Mr. Salinas has kept a low profile, evidently seeking to avoid inflaming the passions of the opposition. Mr. Salinas, who campaigned on a promise of political reform, has yet to get very far in the housecleaning of the PRI hierarchy that was widely expected after the election, in part because he needs to maintain the support of established PRI leaders for the legislative and political fight ahead. </TEXT></DOC>
