Early vascular complications,such as venous thrombosis and arterial occlusion or stenosis, can berecognized by duplex ultrasonography and accurately depicted by angiographyto allow planning of surgical intervention. Stenosis of the renal arteryis amenable to treatment by percutaneous angioplasty. Parenchymatouscomplications (acute tubular necrosis, acute rejection, cyclosporin-Atoxicity)can cause changes in the intrarenal flow patterns at duplex ultra sonography,but this examination does not allow accurate diagnosis and differentiationof these changes. Magnetic resonance imaging is a very promising methodfor the differential diagnosis of parenchymatous complications. (orig.).</TEXT></DOC>
