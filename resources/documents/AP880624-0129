Justice S.K. Seth of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Jabalpurset July 22 for the next hearing, the agency said.   The Indian government has filed a $3 billion suit against UnionCarbide for the 1984 gas leak that killed nearly 3,000 people andinjured more than 20,000 in the southern city of Bhopal.   The gas leak at a pesticide plant operated by a Union Carbidesubsidiary was the world's worst industrial disaster.   Two petitions filed by Union Carbide lawyers concern an order bythe Bhopal District Court instructing the U.S.-based multinationalto pay interim relief to the gas victims.   Seth on April 4 upheld the order and fixed the amount at $192million. Union Carbide lawyers on May 2 petitioned the court toreview Seth's decision.   The other application filed by Union Carbide concerned a June 16order by Bhopal District Judge M.W. Deo.   Union Carbide, headquartered in Danbury, Conn., argued that Deohad pre-judged the case by ordering interim relief. The company hadasked that the case be tranferred to another judge.   Deo declined to remove himself from the case.</TEXT></DOC>
