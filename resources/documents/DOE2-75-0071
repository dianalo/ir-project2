Adsorptionisotherms of heavy metals in coals varying in rank from lignite to bituminouscoal were carried out and the chemical character of sorption was concluded.Evidence of the formation of metal-humic acids complexes was shown bypotentiometric titrations. The cation binding capacity of coal humicacids as a function of pH was studied and the conditional stability constants(log{beta}) for certain heavy metal-humic acids complexes were determinedby the ion-exchange technique. The results quoted here tend to supportthe important role that humic acids play in the geochemical concentrationof heavy metals in coals in the early stages of coal formation. 54 refs.,6 figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
