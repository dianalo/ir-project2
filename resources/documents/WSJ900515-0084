A few years ago, having small businesses band togetherinto Multiple Employer Welfare Associations struck manybusiness owners as a great way to get cheaper health care.But today, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee onInvestigations is scheduled to hold a hearing in Washingtonon MEWA fraud and abuse. &quot;Unscrupulous promoters . . . areliterally playing with people's lives,&quot; says subcommitteechairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.).</LP><TEXT>   Says Raymond Maria, the Labor Department's actinginspector general: &quot;The whole environment is an invitation tolarceny.&quot; Law-enforcement officials say MEWAs have fallen inthe cracks between state and federal oversight.   Those and other problems with MEWAs have left manybusiness owners disillusioned. For instance, Jo Hardwick, theowner of a real-estate agency in Cape Coral, Fla., signedherself and some of her employees into a MEWA when she foundit difficult to get traditional health insurance. &quot;We paidour premiums, and then the problems started,&quot; she recalls.Ms. Hardwick says she is out $1,100 in premiums and has hadto pay $8,000 of medical bills that were supposed to becovered.   According to testimony prepared by the Texas Board ofInsurance for today's Senate hearing, principals of Ms.Hardwick's MEWA, which also operated in Texas, used premiumdollars to lease luxury cars, do construction work on theirhomes and buy expensive suits and jewelry.   James Helm, a principal of the MEWA, last month in adeposition in a Texas state court denied wasting premiumdollars.   To be sure, law-enforcement officials and others familiarwith MEWAs note that many MEWAs are operating successfullyand some MEWA failures are due to factors other thanchicanery. Robert van Maarth, the Lakewood, Colo.,administrator of several MEWAs, says such plans are &quot;still amarvelous idea&quot; when they are properly run and regulated.   MEWAs, which are supposed to act as self-insurance poolsor as purchasers of group policies from insurance companies,have proliferated as small companies cope with soaring healthcosts and difficulty in getting standard coverage.   Nobody seems to know the precise dimensions of MEWA fraud,or even the total number of MEWAs. But state and federalofficials who have begun investigating corruption in thesebenefit plans estimate that unpaid medical claims probablyreach into the hundreds of millions of dollars and affecthundreds of thousands of workers.   For the small-business owner, the financial danger fromfailed MEWAs can be enormous. Patricia Petersen, a deputyinsurance commissioner for the state of Washington, saysemployers could be held liable under federal law for anyunpaid medical bills of their employees.   In the case of Zapata Bancshares Inc., unpaid claims totalseveral hundred thousand dollars, says Laura Miller, whohandles claims for the bank holding company, based in Zapata,Texas. (In 1989, Zapata's net income was $365,000.) Thecompany hopes to recover at least some of the money from theoperators and insurance brokers involved with the samemultistate MEWA used by Ms. Hardwick's firm.   A federal creation in the mid-1970s under the purview ofthe Labor Department, MEWAs were largely unregulated byeither the state or federal government. By the early 1980s,enough MEWA problems were surfacing that Congress gave statestheir own powers to oversee the plans (then generally knownas Multiple Employer Trusts, or METs). But most states stilllooked to the federal government for the lead in regulatingMEWAs.   In Washington state, Ms. Petersen says her office hasreceived increasing numbers of complaints about MEWAs. Amongother things, insurance regulators found that the personrunning one MEWA previously had his securities licenses intwo states revoked for absconding with clients' funds, Ms.Petersen says.   Ms. Petersen called on the Labor Department for help,partly because MEWA administrators were turning away stateinvestigators, claiming federal jurisdiction. &quot;We just neededa federal body to get through the doors,&quot; she says. &quot;But theLabor Department wouldn't do it.&quot;   Tom Gallagher, Florida's insurance commissioner, says thestate has spent a lot of time fighting in court over MEWAs'claims of federal exemption from state regulation. MEWAs&quot;keep taking people's money and not paying claims,&quot; he says.   Labor Department infighting may be hampering moves againstMEWA abuse. Mr. Maria, the acting inspector general, who hasabout two dozen criminal MEWA investigations under way, sayshe could triple such activity if not for restrictions on hisrole. (Bills have recently been introduced in Congress togive inspectors general broader investigative power.)   But David George Ball, an assistant secretary of labor,says the pension and welfare office has responsibility overMEWAs and has some 40 civil and criminal probes of its ownunder way.   Mr. Ball declines to comment on the department's pasthandling of the MEWA issue but says that in recent months ithas &quot;brought tremendous amounts of new resources to bear&quot; onMEWA problems. He says Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole justyesterday sent a letter to each state insurance commissionerpresenting a program for cooperating in investigating MEWAs.   Meanwhile, entrepreneurs can take some steps to protectthemselves, say lawenforcement officials. Their advice:   -- Research any MEWA thoroughly. Get the names of peoplerunning it and find out what jobs they've had before. Checkwith regulators in states where they worked to see if therewere any problems.   -- Ask for a financial plan for the MEWA and get itevaluated by an independent expert. &quot;Our experience is thatthe worst frauds generally won't show you a financialstatement,&quot; says James Harrington, a supervising investigatorwith the California state insurance department.   -- Press insurance agents on exactly what they areselling. Some employers complain that insurance agents tellthem they are getting coverage through an insurance companywhen in truth they are being sold a MEWA.   -- Once in a plan, keep an eye on it. The federal MEWAlegislation envisions employers' being active members of theMEWA boards of trustees, says Washington's Ms. Petersen. Butall too often, she adds, employers &quot;just leave the foxsitting there alone.&quot;   ---   Eugene Carlson contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
