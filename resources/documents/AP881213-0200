JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Transportation Department is reviewing arequest by one of the country's major railroads to eliminate randomtests as part of a drug testing program for railroad workers,officials said Tuesday.   CSX Transportation Inc. filed a petition with the FederalRailroad Administration this week asking that a railroad not berequired to conduct random drug tests if it already has a ``proven''drug testing program under way.   The DOT maintains that random testing is an integral part of aneffective drug testing program for transportation workers involvedin safety related jobs.   But CSX, one of the nation's largest railroad companies, saidrandom testing ``is at best an untried experiment'' and that thereare other methods to combat drug abuse problem in the railroadindustry.   FRA Administrator John Riley said the petition ``will be givenfull and fair consideration,'' as will any other suggestion for amodification of the drug testing requirements that were announcedlast month.   Unions representing 200,000 railroad workers sued Tuesday infederal court in San Francisco, challenging the drug testing programin the railroad industry.   The suit contends random drug testing, without suspicion ofcurrent drug use, violates constitutional standards for searches. Italso contends the FRA has no legal authority to order random testing.   A suit by the unions in the same court resulted in a ruling bythe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in February prohibitingpost-accident drug testing by railroads without reasonable suspicionof individual drug use. That case was one of two drug testing casesargued before the Supreme Court last month; no ruling has beenissued.   The Transportation Department on Nov. 14 said millions oftransportation workers, including railroad workers, will be subjectto a broad range of drug tests beginning in December 1989.   The random tests have been strongly opposed by labor, but mosttransportation companies have endorsed them as being necessary.During a series of hearings on drug testing, CSX was the onlyrailroad that opposed random testing.   In its petition, CSX said it does not believe the evidencesupports random drug testing as the most effective means ofcombating drug abuse in the industry.   CSX asked that a railroad be exempted from the random testingrequirement if it can show that its existing drug testing program``works as well or better than the expectations of random drugtesting.''   ``Random testing in the railroad industry is at best an untriedexperiment with many admitted unknowns,'' CSX said in a statement.``That belief is based not on supposition, but on (the railroad's)actual experience.''</TEXT></DOC>
