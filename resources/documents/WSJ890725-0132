A year earlier, profit was $81.4 million, or $1.53 a share, on sales of $1.44 billion.    Backlog at the end of the quarter was a record $12 billion, up from $10.8 billion a year earlier.    Norman R. Augustine, chairman and chief executive, said the company &quot;remains optimistic for the full year.&quot; Results were particularly strong in the astronautics group as the company stepped up production of the Titan IV unmanned launch vehicle used to carry heavy payloads into space.    In the first six months, profit was $146.1 million, or $2.76 a share, up from $132.4 million, or $2.49 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $2.75 billion from $2.74 billion.
