Brown, a former Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. investment banker, was sentenced to 30 days in prison for his part in the Dennis Levine insider-trading scheme.    Mr. Brown, 32 years old, also must perform 300 hours of community service, serve three years' probation and pay a $10,000 fine. He earlier agreed to pay $145,790 to settle civil charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission.    The former Goldman Sachs vice president is the second person to be sentenced in the Levine case. He pleaded guilty in September to one count of securities fraud and one count of mail fraud for passing inside information from Goldman Sachs to Ira B. Sokolow, a former Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. investment banker, who then forwarded the information to Mr. Levine. Mr. Sokolow is serving a sentence of a year and a day for his part in the scheme.    Before the sentencing in federal court here, prosecutors disclosed in a letter to Judge John F. Keenan that before Mr. Brown turned himself in last year, he alerted an unnamed arbitrager to whom he had provided inside information. Prosecutors said Mr. Brown's action denied them the chance to use &quot;certain investigative techniques&quot; in connection with that tip. Neither Mr. Brown's attorney nor the federal government would elaborate, but no arbitragers other than Ivan F. Boesky have been implicated in the Levine case.    The government said it is investigating the arbitrager mentioned in connection with Mr. Brown's tip. It didn't name the arbitrager.    Mr. Levine, 34, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. managing director, made more than $4 million on the Brown tips on proposed corporate takeovers, the government said. As an example, Mr. Brown would tell Mr. Sokolow that a company was on Goldman Sachs's &quot;restricted list&quot; of stocks, which indicates a big transaction involving the company is likely, the government said. Mr. Brown received about $30,000 in cash for his information.    In a brief statement before Judge Keenan, Mr. Brown said he is taking full responsibility for his crimes, and apologized to his family. He added that his &quot;greatest shame&quot; was that his actions could besmirch Goldman Sachs.    Six Wall Street professionals so far have been convicted in the Levine case. Mr. Levine, who the government says made $12 million based on inside tips, was responsible for implicating Mr. Boesky, who has agreed to pay $100 million in fines and returned profits.    Mr. Levine is to be sentenced next month. No date has been scheduled for Mr. Boesky's promised guilty plea; prosecutors have said Mr. Boesky will plead guilty to one felony count, exposing him to a maximum five years in prison.    Charles Carberry, the assistant U.S. attorney handling the insider probes, said in his letter to Judge Keenan that Mr. Brown was &quot;debriefed . . . on several occasions&quot; and helped the government in &quot;clearing up some details concerning the Levine ring.&quot; He said Mr. Brown's cooperation &quot;was of limited value,&quot; though some of the information is being used in the continuing insider-trading probe. </TEXT></DOC>
