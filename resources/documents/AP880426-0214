The court, which has no enforcement powers, sided with theUnited Nations and ruled that the PLO issue must go to independentarbitration. It rebuked the Reagan administration for its effortsto close the PLO mission.   The United States sought a New York federal court order to closethe mission after President Reagan signed new anti-terroristlegislation in December. Under the law, the PLO is classified as a``terrorist organization'' and is prevented from operating on U.S.soil.   The U.S. court has not yet acted.   The world court president, Jose Maria Ruda, reading from the25-page opinion, said the closure proceedings violated a 1947 pactbetween the United States and the United Nations that assureddiplomats unhindered access to the international organization.   That accord, called the the Headquarters Agreement, calls forarbitration in such disputes. The United States has rejectedarbitration.   The U.S. government maintains that the anti-terrorist law isexempt from ``any international legal obligations that the UnitedStates may have under the Headquarters Agreement.''   The Reagan administration move against the PLO's Americanpresence has been condemned by all U.N. member nations except theUnited States and Israel.   Carl-August Fleischhauer of West Germany, the U.N.undersecretary-general for legal affairs, told reporters afterTuesday's ruling that he was not optimistic that the United Stateswould submit to arbitration.   ``Although we want harmonious relations with our host country,we are satisfied that the court spoke in the same sense as wedid,'' Fleischhauer said.   ``We are ready to go to arbitration. It is now basically for theUnited States government to decide what conclusions it draws fromthis ruling,'' he said.   The PLO was granted permanent observer status by the UnitedNations General Assembly in 1974, and its U.N. mission has beenoperating since then out of an office in Manhattan.   The PLO's information office in Washington was closed down priorto passage of the American legislation.   Early this year, the U.S. government said that arbitration waspremature, noting that the anti-terrorist law would go into effecton March 22.   When the PLO refused to comply with U.S. Attorney General EdwinMeese III's March 22 order to close down its Manhattan office, theU.S. government filed suit in federal court.   The American judge on the world court, Stephen M. Schwebel,voted against Washington.   In a separate opinion, Schwebel said that although he hadreservations about the court's opinion ``a state cannot avoid itsinternational responsibility'' by referring issues such as the PLOmission dispute to a domestic court.   Since only sovereign states and U.N. bodies are entitled tobring cases before the court, the PLO has been unable to plead itscase. But confidential briefs believed to support its position havebeen filed by Syria and East Germany.   In 1986, the court ordered a halt to Reagan administrationsupport for the rebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government,ruling that the support violated international law. But the UnitedStates boycotted most of those proceedings, claiming the court hadno jurisdiction in the case.</TEXT></DOC>
