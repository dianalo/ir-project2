Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel who has spent thepast five years and $27.4 million pressing for convictions inthe tangled Iran-Contra matter, stood grimly outside the samecourthouse where he won a conviction against Mr. North twoyears ago.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's a difficult moment,&quot; he said, explaining that hischances of seeing a &quot;successful outcome&quot; were &quot;diminished&quot;and that the &quot;expenditure of additional prosecutorial,defense and judicial resources in this case is notwarranted.&quot;   An exultant Mr. North pronounced himself &quot;totallyexonerated&quot; and said his full military benefits will berestored. &quot;For five years, my family and I have been underfire. The generosity and prayers of the American peoplesustained us,&quot; he said, as his wife and two daughters beamedbehind him.   The prosecution against Mr. North began unraveling almostimmediately after a Washington, D.C., jury convicted him inMay 1989 for destroying documents, accepting an illegalgratuity and aiding the obstruction of Congress. In 1990, athreejudge appeals panel set aside the convictions, rulingthat the trial judge would have to demonstrate that Mr.North's 1987 congressional testimony, which was given under agrant of immunity, wasn't used against him at his criminaltrial.   The chances of being able to meet that test all butevaporated last week, when former National Security AdviserRobert McFarlane stunned the court by saying that his owntestimony at Mr. North's trial had been &quot;colored&quot; by Mr.North's congressional appearance.   Mr. Walsh said he had urged Congress not to immunize Mr.North and added, &quot;Any illusion that immunity can be grantedwith a prosecution to follow is fraught with difficulty.&quot; Hedeclined to comment on the likelihood that the 1990conviction his office won against former National SecurityAdviser John Poindexter, who also gave immunizedcongressional testimony, would likewise crumble.   Congressional leaders were quick to try to deflectcriticism for their decision to grant immunity to Mr. Northand other Iran-Contra figures. Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.),who headed the special House committee that investigated theIran-Contra affair, said, &quot;It was the correct decision, eventhough the question of criminal liability was jeopardized. Ifwe had not granted immunity to North and Poindexter, we neverwould have understood these events.&quot;   He said that &quot;the hearings were more important than thetrial,&quot; but added that &quot;in the future, Congress will have tobe very cautious in granting immunized testimony.&quot;   House counsel Steven Ross said the appeals court ruling onMr. North's case raised the standard for showing that a trialis untainted by immunized testimony. The court had left Mr.Walsh with the unappealing choice of seeking a retrial orproving that every statement by every witness during thetrial wasn't influenced by Mr. North's immunized statementsto Congress.   Another reason for dropping the North case, Mr. Walshsaid, was the &quot;heavy pressure&quot; his office is under tocomplete its investigation. Earlier this month, a grand juryindicted Clair George, a former CIA operative, for statementsMr. George made to congressional investigators and grandjuries delving into the Iran-Contra affair. Mr. Georgepleaded not guilty last Thursday. Mr. Walsh was able to winMr. George's indictment after obtaining the cooperation ofAlan Fiers, another former CIA operative, who pleaded guiltyin July to withholding Iran-Contra information from Congress.   Mr. Walsh's office has won nine Iran-Contra convictionssince he took the job as independent counsel in 1986. Despitethe crushing disappointment of seeing the case against Mr.North dismissed, Mr. Walsh hinted yesterday at thepossibility of still more Iran-Contra indictments.   Mr. North, a retired Marine officer, was sentenced in July1989 to two years of probation, $150,000 in fines and 1,200hours of community service. He did the service, but the restof his sentence was set aside pending the outcome of hisappeal.   Mr. North's indictment grew out of a covert operation heran out of the Reagan White House in the mid-1980s to supplyarms to the Contra rebels who were fighting Nicaragua'sSandinista government. Excess profits from secretarms-for-hostages deals with Iran were used to funnel aid tothe Nicaraguan rebels, even though Congress banned suchmilitary support.   Mr. North was convicted of lying to Congress about theoperation. During his trial, he said he thought his actionswere authorized by President Reagan and former CIA DirectorWilliam Casey. Mr. Casey was dead when Mr. North went totrial, and former President Reagan denied in a depositionthat he had authorized the North operation.</TEXT></DOC>
