Responding to allegations read by American hostage TerryAnderson in a new videotape released by his pro-Iranian captors inLebanon, Reagan said ``I don't think that was Terry speaking. Ithink he had a script that was given to him.''   Reagan was asked about the tape at a ceremony where he signedlegislation that offers U.S. artists and writers copyrightprotections under an international treaty.   On the two-minute, 35-second tape, Anderson, the chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press, voiced a statementaccusing the U.S. government of preventing his release. Thestatement also accused Bush of having dealt with terrorists in the1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner and in the Iran-Contra arms deal,another allegation Reagan denied.   Bush, interviewed on the NBC Nightly News, said, ``I had no rolethat you are aware of or not aware of, absolutely,'' in the TWAhijacking negotiations.   The Republican presidential candidate also said he was ``alittle bit optimistic about their letting these hostages out. Ithink with Iran-Iraq having a cease-fire, I think it's in Iran'sinterest, though they don't hold the hostages, to do what they canto encourage their release. I think it would set whoever is electedpresident a good tone for the possibility of improved relations.''   Earlier, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had denouncedthe kidnappers, accusing them of ``a cynical attempt'' to use thehostages to influence the U.S. presidential election.   Contrary to many instances in the past, the president spoke atlength with reporters about the latest hostage tape. Reaganappeared eager to discuss the matter, and stepped up to themicrophone to answer reporters' questions.   Queried whether the U.S. government had interfered when thehostages were about to be released, Reagan said, ``That isabsolutely not true, but let me point something out. Terry Anderson_ in that terrible confinement at the hands of those barbarians _any information he has, has to have come from there; there is nocontact with the outside world.''   Reagan insisted that his administration has been ``doingeverything we can for the release of the hostages, and the verysimple answer is, for those people, to let them go.''   ``There has never been any interference, nor have we ever beennegotiating any more than we would with any other kind of akidnapper on a ransom type of basis,'' he said.   When asked whether he thought the kidnappers were trying toinfluence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, he said,``You'd have to ask them; I can't fathom their minds.''   Reagan then went on to dispute the charge on the tape that Bushwas involved in negotiations in the sale of arms to Iran and inresolving the 1985 Middle East hijacking of a TWA jet. Navy diverRobert Stethem was killed by the hijackers during that ordeal.   ``Nor was I, because we were never doing anything of thatkind,'' Reagan replied.   Asked again if Bush had played a role in negotiations for therelease of the TWA hostages, Reagan launched into a spiriteddefense of his vice president, saying ``George has been a part ofeverything we've accomplished. I've always felt that a vicepresident should be an executive vice president, as in acorporation, and not somebody sitting over on the sidelines waitingfor me to have a relapse.''   Reagan went on: ``He's been a part of that, but in aconstructive way, and that's why he's my choice in this comingelection.''   But when pressed again whether he was answering `yes,' to Bush'salleged involvement in the TWA hijacking, Reagan turned to answeranother query about the circumstances of the release of the tape.   Bush told NBC he was never involved in negotiations either inthe TWA or the Iran-Contra cases, according to press secretarySheila Tate.   The vice president previously has said he was not a key playerin the sale of arms to Iran and was unaware of details and planningof it.   Pressed to explain his and Bush's involvement in the Iran-Contraaffair _ which the questioner described as having developed into ascandal _ the president shot back, ``There was no scandal. Thatscandal, I'm afraid, has been artificially created by a media thatI cannot understand.''   About prospects for release of Anderson and other Americans heldin Lebanon, the president said, ``I'm not going to give up hope forany of our hostages that are held; that's just too unthinkable.''   But, he said, ``the one thing we cannot do is negotiate with thekidnappers on a sort of ransom idea because that just encouragesmore kidnaping and more hostage-taking.''   Asked what about Anderson's statement that the United Statesappeared to show more interest in the release of the two graywhales trapped in the ice of Alaska than the fate of the hostages,Reagan responded again that he believed Anderson was only reading ascript that had been given him.   ``When I was given a script, I always read the lines,'' he added.   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, said Monday her brother lookedstronger than in the past, adding, ``He seemed somewhat relaxed. Ididn't see the kind of tension or fear that has come across in someof the pictures (released in the past).''   She said she has given up criticizing federal policy againstnegotiating with her brother's kidnappers.   ``You come to a place where you understand that when a horsedies you get off it,'' Say said. ``The hostages are not a greatenough number to excite the masses. (But) if there were a planeload of Americans, would we allow our president to not lift afinger?''</TEXT></DOC>
