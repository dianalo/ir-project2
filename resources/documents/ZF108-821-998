 JayCostenbader, head of Goddard's Systems Technology Applications Section, leadsthe team of engineers responsible for Project PacOr.andM;PacOr (Packet Processor) refers to processing the packetized telemetryinformation that is beamed to Earth from NASA's fleet of unmanned spacecraft.andO;The job involves using computers to strip off the routing data that is addedto each packet by satellite and ground-based relay stations and running aseries of diagnostics to ensure that no transmission errors have corruptedthe original data.andP;  The unadulterated telemetry signals are then provided toNASA scientists in the form of a tape or as a direct feed over the spaceagency's X.25 network.andM;Project PacOr recently developed and installed an X windows-based applicationrunning on Sun Microsystems hardware and using the Open Software Foundation'sMotif graphical user interface (GUI).andP;  For the first time, the PacOrengineers can proactively correct the data capture process, producing moreerror-free data and reducing the need to have the telemetry rebroadcast bythe remote relay stations.andM;Prior to installing the X windows-based system, Project PacOr had to have thetelemetry processing carried out by a pair of redundant Gould minicomputers.andO;According to Costenbader, the engineers monitored and controlled thecomputers by means of dumb terminals.andP;  The telemetry processing applicationresided as a bulky software package on the minicomputers, taking priorityover management of the terminal interface.andP;  As a result, users were virtuallylocked out of the system whenever the computer started receiving a telemetrybroadcast.andP;  If problems occurred in the processing and began corrupting thedata, the engineers were powerless to make corrections until the transmissionended.andM;&quot;You'd be notified there was an error, but there was no advance warning andnot much you could do about it until after the fact,&quot; Costenbader said.andM;To correct the errors, the engineers spent an average of two hours each dayprocessing &quot;replays&quot; of the telemetry, which required coordination with othertelemetry receivers around the country.andP;  Additional time was spentpainstakingly locating the sources of the errors, causing further delays inprocessing and transmitting the data to scientists.andM;Then along came X.andM;Using the X windows program, the NASA developers created software to run ontwin Sun-3 workstations.andP;  Using a mouse to open windows that graphicallydepict the capture and processing of telemetry data, users now monitor andadjust the process on the fly.andM;Two Sun workstations are needed at each of PacOr's three user stationsbecause of the CPU-intensive processing of the custom user interface and theneed to see and manage the more than 55 interactive windows available to auser at any given time, Costenbader said.andM;Each workstation is equipped with 700MB of disk storage, 12MB of RAM and a19-inch color monitor.andP;  A pair of redundant Ethernet networks connects theworkstations with the Gould minis and with a Motorola 68000-based system thatreplaces the old Gould-based packet-processing software with a VLSI hardwareimplementation.andP;  The Gould machines are now used as a database processor,taking stripped telemetry packets from the VLSI processor and compiling theminto the finished product, a single time-ordered data stream.andM;Developing the GUI for the application represented 50 percent to 60 percentof the entire software development project's time and cost.andP;  It took seven$30,000-a-year programmers about two years for a total development cost of$420,000, Costenbader said.andP;  The programmers relied on a NASA-developed Xwindows tool kit called TAE (Transportable Applications Environment) Plus toaid them in developing the GUI.andM;About 10 percent of the GUI code had to be written the hard way, using Xlibcalls at the fundamental X11 release 3 window system level.andP;  This portion ofthe development process, creating graphical tables that were too complex forTAE Plus, took five times as much code and 10 times longer to produce thanportions of the GUI that were written using the TAE Plus point-and-clickmethod of development, according to Costenbader.andM;However, Costenbader said there are trade-offs to using a high-level X toolkit such as TAE Plus.andP;  Although it saves development effort, it creates moresoftware overhead that can bog down system performance.andP;  In addition, theall-purpose design of the tool kit forces the developer to generalize andrelinquish some control over use of the windowing system.andM;The overhead is a result of TAE Plus separating the user interface controlcode from the application-specific code, placing the former into separateties that at start-up time must be loaded into memory and interpreted.andP;  Thisscheme eases development and maintenance of the program, but lengthens thestart-up time because the program has to search for, and load into memory,the files containing the user interface information.andP;  Thus, those users whoare limited by memory or I/O will be adversely affected by this strategy,Costenbader said.andM;&quot;We try not to resort to [programming in basic]X, and if you're ingeniousenough, you can come up with ways to get around the tool kit program&quot; and getthe desired results, he said.andP;  Instead of having to drop into X programmingto control password echoing on a login screen, Costenbader said, theprogrammer would either change the background and foreground colors so theyare both the same, or use an unreadable font.andP;  These tasks are easilyperformed at a higher level.andM;X AS A BUILDING BLOCKandM;At the Houston Chronicle, the X Window System is being installed now as abuilding block for future applications.andM;The newspaper recently embarked on a plan to scrap its entire armada ofoutdated PC ATs and replace them with a system of Unix workstations and Xdisplay terminals.andP;  The first leg of the project included the purchase of 10Sparc-based Sun servers, 100 Sun-3/60 workstations, eight Sparcstation 1workstations and 100 X terminals from Visual Technology of Westborough, Mass.andO;The hardware is linked via Ethernet and a high-speed FDDI backbone networkfrom Ultra Network Technologies of San Jose, Calif.andM;John Mercer, the Chronicle's pagination coordinator, is overseeing thechangeover in the display advertising department and among clerical users.andO;He plans to replicate the changeover throughout the entire paper.andP;  In anaggressive 18-month time frame, the Chronicle hopes to scrap itsfive-year-old, stand-alone PCs and replace them with a network consisting ofas many as 1,000 X terminal and workstation nodes running off 12 to 16servers.andM;Aside from the physical network cable, X windows will provide theconnectivity between the various hardware platforms on the network, Mercersaid.andP;  &quot;The main benefit [of running X windows] is that it's going to allowour vendors to operate across many platforms,&quot; he said.andM;The current installation of Sun workstations and X display terminals providesthe respective front ends for display advertising application from Camex andan office automation package from Uniplex Integration Systems of Irving,Texas.andM;Although the current software coexists with, and in some cases takesadvantage of the X windowing system, the Chronicle is waiting for itssoftware vendors to provide new versions of the applications that fullyimplement a GUI based on X, Mercer said.andM;For example, the display and classified advertising software is currentlybased on Sun's proprietary SunView user interface and windowing system.andO;According to Boston-based Camex, the company that developed the software, thedisplay advertising system (originally developed on the Mac) can be ported tothe X environment in about three man-months.andP;  Converting the classifiedadvertising system from SunView to X11 represents a two-man-month project.andM;The new X-based system, including hardware and software, will cost the paperabout $14,000 per seat for workstations and $8,000 per seat for X terminals.andM;The Chronicle is also currently using a hybrid character-based/X windowsversion of office automation software from Uniplex.andP;  This software adds arudimentary implementation of X's graphical abilities to the text-basedsoftware, permitting the use of a mouse to activate scroll bars and selectfrom pop-up menus.andM;The cost of the new hardware and software systems will be offset by increasedproductivity and reduced system maintenance and support efforts, Mercer said.andM;For the first time in the Chronicle's history, &quot;users will have a commondatabase, and they'll be able to share printing resources and E-mail,&quot; hesaid.andM;The eventual incorporation of office automation applications that trulyharness the bit-mapped graphics possible with X windows will further increaseuser productivity by allowing the easy manipulation of data across multiplewindows.andM;In addition, the ad-building applications that now run only on Sun hardwareunder SunView will be available over X11 to users throughout the system.andP;  Theapplications have already afforded a quantum increase in productivity byeliminating many of the tedious production jobs that were once done by hand,Mercer said.andM;The system will also relieve the newspaper's system maintenance and supportcrew because it &quot;gives you control of the software on the system, so [users]don't load God-knows-what on their PC and then call you to make it all workagain,&quot; he said.andM;X TRANSLATES INTO MONEYandM;Perhaps the example most frequently used to illustrate X windows' potentialbenefits is the harried Wall Street commodities trader, who until recentlyspent long hours peering into a half-dozen alphanumeric terminals trying totrack financial trends.andP;  These users are increasingly moving toward X windowsas well as a number of proprietary windowing systems that allow commoditiestraders to integrate various sources of information for the first time on onehigh-resolution display.andM;For the 16 traders employed in New York City by the French commercial bankSociete Generale, their liberation came in the form of DECstation 2100srunning DEC's X windows implementation, DECwindows.andM;According to Moshe Eliovson, Societe Generale's systems officer, the tradersuse DEC's Price Watch application to monitor financial information gleanedfrom numerous on-line information services around the world.andP;  The bank reliedon third-party software for the most part, providing in-house development ona piecemeal basis to integrate commercial packages, Eliovson said.andM;As the developer supporting the bank's New York trading floor, Eliovsondescribed a small GUI development project he was undertaking for a particulartrader.andP;  The trader wanted a way to download a window of information from acertain on-line information service, which would be modified and then sentback to the information vendor to be posted throughout the network.andM;Using a high-level X windows development language called TeleUse fromTelesoft of San Diego, Eliovson estimated he could write a working prototypein less than three weeks.andP;  The code necessary to complete the project wouldinclude about 150 lines of TeleUse language script and about 1,000 lines ofcode to handle communications between the existing applications and theon-line service, he said.andM;Programmers should expect to spend weeks or months initially to becomefamiliar with a high-level X prototyping language such as TeleUse, butdevelopment work goes rapidly once fluency is achieved, Eiovson said.andM;Although he has not quantified the benefits of his development efforts,productivity benefits to traders are highly leveraged, and could translateinto a substantial return on a relatively inexpensive investment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
