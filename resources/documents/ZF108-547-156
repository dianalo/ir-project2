[Laughter]andM;By now we all know the pc revolution has not realized its total promise inthe workplace, even though it's made drastically increasing strides gettingthere.andP;  In recent years, we have filled more than enough industry conferencesand editorial space talking about making technology useful and bridging thegap between technology and customers.andP;  At the PC Outlook conference severalmonths ago, everyone including me was talking about service as opposed totechnology.andM;Esther duly noted this in her newsletter, and I was quoted saying that evensoftware might be a service rather than a technology.andP;  Others made equallyradical pronouncements; this was such a recurrent theme it seemed as if weall were trying to become Arthur Andersen clones.andM;Technology - the magic ingredientandM;As someone trying to lead the service charge, I also want to make sure wedon't forget it is the technology that ultimately provides the highest valuefor our customers.andM;In the last couple of years we have provided more speed, power and functionsthan customers can absorb.andP;  The immediate task at hand is to help them useall of that stuff more productively.andM;Service may drive the next epicycle of the pc revolution, but it's only anepicycle.andP;  Over the long run, technology - as it has from the start-is goingto drive us.andP;  Esther pointed out the danger in the service orientation whenshe wrote: &quot;If a product is truly terrible, good support can't make up forit.&quot; That is absolutely true, as we know from personal experience with acouple of things at Lotus.andM;To explain the long-term impact of technology, I've collected some universallaws; a couple I've invented.andP;  I've nothing quite as exciting as theoverthrow of matter to talk about, but George Gilder may in fact be carryingthings a bit too far.andP;  [Laughter]andM;Manzi's Eternal LawsandM;Let me start with my eternal laws and a guy named Bishop Berkely, an18th-century philosopher who was the first to try to overthrow matter.andP;  Thissays, he is kicking a rock, he says, &quot;Thus I refute Berkely.&quot;andM;This particular slide was done with the Elizabethan ValueMac from FreelancePlus.andM;[Laughter]andM;Two months ago when I read Gilder's book, I was chagrined that software wasnot even a micro part of the microcosm.andP;  Despite the revolutionary impact weaU think that chips and microprocessors have had, the basic truth remains:Hardware without software is useless.andM;Hardware with software is a question mark, but hardware and software and data- the D is for data - translates into real value.andP;  I warn you that you'regoing to see a lot of these high-value equations today.andM;[Laughter]andM;This is for a couple of reasons: To help with the ebb and flow of the talkand to refute Bill Gates' complaint that I'm not technical enough.andM;[Laughter and applause]andM;It is also basic truth that hardware and software are useless without data.andO;When it comes to the overthrow of matter -which is what Gilder was talkingabout in the first half of the book there's no better example than software.andO;From an economist's standpoint of adding value to raw materials, software ispure value.andM;Gilder's approach is still pretty dark, so here is a grab bag of thoughts -from theology, from physics, from economies - to explain technology's role inthe world.andM;The theological principles, of course, are absolute.andP;  The physical laws havetop priority as well, but they're subject to change just as Einstein changedNewton.andP;  You can take or leave the economic principles.andM;The law of inertia: Technology stays at rest until the Japanese bring it tothe marketplace.andM;[Laughter]andM;My first principle is a thinly disguised ripoff of Sir Isaac Newton's firstlaw of motion, and describes how we as Americans view our strengths andrationalize our competitive failures.andM;According to this widely held view, the US excels in research and puretechnology, while others - who always seem to be the Japanese - are better atadapting technology.andP;  The example usually cited is how the VCR was inventedhere, but turned into a blockbuster consumer product by two dozen companiesin Japan.andP;  I'm not sure this jingoist view is true.andM;The US does excel in scientific research - and spends more on it than anybodyelse - but science is not technology.andP;  One of the best descriptions of purescience comes from Sheldon Glashow, a Nobel Prize physicist at Harvard, whosays,  I don't know if pure science exists, but useless science certainlyexists, and that's my favorite kind.&quot;andM;[Laughter]andM;Technology on the other hand always involves use or its potential.andP;  To saywe're better at pure technology - whatever that isandM;and the Japanese are better at applying it, is a meaningless distinction.andM;The problem is that many people think the distinction is real, and in therush to become more competitive, we have given technology short shrift.andO;Market-driven technology has become the current fetish of the Americanbusiness class, displacing Japanese management techniques.andP;  This lastobsession lasted only a couple of years.andP;  We should hope that imitatingso-called demand-driven technology has an even shorter stay.andM;At many companies, it simply becomes an excuse for cutting back on technologyor investments and getting out products before they're ready.andP;  There is afine balance between what we deliver and responding to customer needs.andO;Rarely do our customers demand technology, but obviously they have demandstechnology can meet.andM;Our job is to discover those demands and their answers.andP;  This means we mustput technology ahead of everything else.andP;  However, a recent National ScienceFoundation report says corporate research and development in the US has begunto decline in spending terms for the first time in 14 years.andP;  According tothe report, corporations are shifting resources from longer-term research toone-to-two-year product development.andM;More Manzi lawsandM;I began developing these universal laws about eight months ago as a form oftherapy when everybody was waiting for something called 1-2-3 Release 3.andO;This was my first effort at a universal law before I started taking thisseriously: Infinity is equal to a realistic release date, minus a promisedrelease date.andM;[Laughter]andM;As I managed to get hold of myself, I converted this simple thought into alaw of engineering: Stress is equal to a realistic release date, minus apromised release date, divided by the installed base.andM;[Laughter]andM;Moving on to more serious equations: According to OECD statistics, Japanesecompanies are spending three times what American companies are spending onresearch and development.andP;  And these days, they're concentrating mostresources on high-value technology like software.andM;We might do well to imitate the Japanese example, but we had better be clearwhat it is.andP;  No longer are they spending money, time and energy on adaptingtechnology - they're concentrating on technology, period.andM;The next law is based not on physics, but on economies, and states that valueis a function of technology.andP;  It happens to be one of the few laws ofeconomics that has proven to be true.andM;As everyone knows, economists have trouble dealing with the way things reallywork.andP;  About eight years ago when I was a management consultant, we came upwith a formula for a client that related capital-investment spending tolong-term production costs.andP;  The equation was true for five straight years.andM;The client, an integrated manufacturing company, loved it.andP;  The in-houseeconomist, however, sat back, puffed on his pipe and said, &quot;This may be truein practice, but does it work in theory?&quot;andM;[Laughter]andM;This particular equation - in which value is the function of technology -happens to be true both in theory and practice.andP;  &quot;The Economist&quot; published atable last month that calibrates this kind of equation.andM;The table [above right] shows the added value of a satellite, semiconductors,cars and the like.andP;  These are ball park figures, but they're roughly correct.andO;For example, the value of the computer technology in a satellite is greaterthan if the satellite itself were pure gold.andM;Anyone who doubts the tremendous economic power of technology has to look nofurther than our own industry in the last decade.andP;  Chip speed has increaseddramatically from a tenth of a MIPS in 1981 to 100 times that today on the486; in 1981, DRAMs had 64K, and today there are four-megabit chips; capacityon disk drives has increased from 5 million bytes to 0.7 billion; and IBM istalking about a gigabit on one square inch.andM;We can begin to grasp the fuR potential of these advances when we look atcosts.andP;  An IBM PC with a tenth of a MIPS in processing power cost about $5000in 1981; today the same machine with ten times that horsepower goes for aboutthe same price.andP;  In 1972, a kilobit DRAM cost about $10; now the cost ofDRAMs is less than I cent per kilobit.andP;  Disk drives have also plummeted incost.andM;The Times says the cost of storage on a per-megabyte basis will approach 11cents, or zero by the year 2000.andP;  George Gilder and others have described theenormous economic impact of recent advances in computer technology.andP;  Georgedescribes it in terms of the overthrow of matter.andP;  In old-fashioned Newtonianterms, force equals mass times acceleration.andM;Force is the still-untapped economic potential of computer technology createdby acceleration - processing power- times mass - the incredible density oftoday's computer data.andP;  This Newtonian law is relevant to our business insoftware: Force is the economic power of software...andP;  mass - the density ofinformation - times acceleration, or the ease with which a user gets accessto data, the ability of an organization to get relevant information to theright people at the right time.andM;An information ageandM;It has become a truism that we live in an information age.andP;  But the clichemasks the fact that information has always been crucial.andP;  Walter Wriston, whobuilt Citicorp, wrote, &quot;Information about money is more important than moneyitself.&quot; He never tired of telling a story about Baron Rothschild, who usedcarrier pigeons to get the news of the English victory at Waterloo beforeanyone else.andP;  Then he made a fortune by plunging into British governmentbonds.andP;  Good information has always mattered.andP;  The big difference today isthat less of it comes by carrier pigeon.andM;[Laughter]andM;Most good information is created by software interacting with data.andP;  Here isthe algebraic formulation for the information age: Information is a functionof software and data.andP;  Combined with telecommunications and with hardware,vast amounts of data or money can go around the world in a few seconds or afew bytes before anyone, including Baron Rothschild, knows anything about it.andM;However, to capture the full promise of technology, entropy must be reversed.andO;It is clear that pc technology will not fulfill its promise until thedata-and therefore the information-moves beyond the island of the individual.andO;One school of thought in our industry says the desktop computer will remain apersonal appliance of little benefit to large organizations; in fact, it willhelp to undermine them.andM;That is dead wrong.andP;  That school underestimates the range, the adaptabilityand the importance of the personal computer and its advances for the last tenyears.andM;Through much of the 1980s, it's true, the law of entropy held sway over theinformation systems of most organizations.andP;  Computing resources became moredispersed as users were either empowered by pcs or liberated by them from themainframe.andM;This brought significant gains in personal efficiency, but the big questionis whether this localization of power and resources has had anything to dowith productivity or effectiveness.andM;Let me conclude with one final law concerning technology in the marketplaceabout a couple of products we're familiar with at Lotus: Products like Agendaand Notes create their own demand.andP;  This is a self-serving version of Say'sLaw.andP;  Economists still debate whether supply creates its own demand, butclearly in technology, leading-edge products must create their own demand.andM;By definition technology always involves uses or applications, but it doesn'tfollow that they arc immediately apparent.andP;  Agenda and Notes are goodexamples of products that will meet real customer needs, even though theyhave no well-defined market or demand in the first instance.andM;Agenda is something that's come to be caned a personal information manager.andO;There was no demand for it in the market place, but it created its own place.andO;However, we learned a lot of lessons from Agenda, in the sense that weshipped Randamp;D.andP;  We are now seeing that it does resolve a need, it does solve alot of problems for a lot of people, tens of thousands of them.andP;  We're nowseeing demand for Agenda pick up and we're trying to meet it.andP;  We're tryingto do things smarter with the Randamp;D we shipped.andP;  We have lots of work to do tomake that product more accessible, but we're real excited about the goodstart.andM;We developed Notes - our groupware communications product - even though noone specifically or loudly had asked for it.andP;  We decided to take our timebefore bringing it to market because we wanted to understand more about it.andO;It was a state change over communications software available today.andP;  But weknew it could help groups work more effectively, once people saw it andlearned bow to use it.andP;  We had a marketing beta and a development beta inparallel, which paid off.andP;  When we announced the product, we had a sizableorder from Price Waterhouse.andP;  One last time, Sheldon: Thank you !andP;  Say's Lawnotwithstanding, we are not relying on abstract market forces to get peopleto use these products.andP;  The success of breakthrough products often requiresthe breaking of old ways of thinking.andP;  Not just our customers' habits, butours as well.andM;In the case of Agenda, Notes and this whole area of information management ortext analytics, we are spending a whole lot of time on traditional Randamp;D, butwe're also spending time on marketing Randamp;D to understand what informationmanagement issues exist, what customers are dealing with, and what we canapply in the way of technology.andM;Closing the gapandM;This is new ground.andP;  We will never be completely successful in closing thetime gap between the technology and the marketplace.andP;  Our fundamental role -your role, too - is to lead our customers with technology.andM;But the gap between us and our customers has widened too much in the last 12to 24 months.andP;  The big opportunity in the 1990s is to close that gapconsiderably.andP;  That's possible only by delivering great products - those inwhich the user is indifferent to the technology, and the technology isinvisible to the user.andM;The gap isn't a problem, but rather the constraint, the basis of the finaluniversal law that drives us forward.andP;  It is the very nature of what we'redoing to be ahead of customers by 6 months, by 12 months, by 24 months, butobviously with an eye to the marketplace and a belief that we're going tomake our lives and their lives better.andM;Thank you very much.andM;[Applause]</TEXT></DOC>
