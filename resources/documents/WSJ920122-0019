For every10,000 substances examined, 20 enter animal studies and 10enter human trials -- but only one becomes a prescriptionmedicine. The fact that resistance has emerged in severalpatients to our leading anti-AIDS compound L-697,661 wasdisappointing but not surprising. We will now focus researchon the development of our compound L-696,229, which we willevaluate in combination with AZT.   Merck has made a long-term commitment, which remainsunabated, to discover and develop anti-viral agents astherapies for AIDS, as well as vaccines to prevent it. Thenature of the disease and the public discussions surroundingit force pharmaceutical companies such as Merck to talk aboutour research at a much earlier stage of investigation than wewould normally choose.</LP><TEXT>   Nevertheless, in all our communications we have tried tomake it clear that the risks of failure are high. That is whywe were surprised and disappointed with the statement in yourarticle that we introduced our anti-AIDS compounds to humanstudies 11 months ago &quot;with great fanfare.&quot; The only pressinitiative we have made to date on these compounds was apress release issued Dec. 20, 1990. It began, &quot;In response toinquiries Merck today announced that it has entered twoclosely related compounds into very preliminary Phase I humanstudies as potential therapies for AIDS.&quot; We went on in thebrief release to say that &quot;company officials stress that mostcompounds at such an early stage of investigation fail.&quot;   Albert D.
