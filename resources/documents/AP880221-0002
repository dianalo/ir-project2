The members of Justice Minister Nabih Berri's mainstream ShiiteAmal militia fired back with rocket-propelled grenades during thehalf-hour clash in Ein el-Tineh but no injuries were reported, apolice spokesman said.   Hezbollah gunners later pounded Israel's self-designatedsecurity zone in south Lebanon with mortars, said the spokesman,who spoke on condition of anonymity according to regulations.   He said Israel retaliated by shelling 13 southern Shiitevillages for three hours. Four civilians were wounded, police said.   A Hezbollah leader said he believed the U.S. Marine, Lt. Col.William R. Higgins, had been smuggled out of south Lebanon.   ``We declare solidarity with, and full support for, thestrugglers against America who confront the plots of the greatSatan,'' said a statement from Hezbollah, or Party of God. ``Thedemands of the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth are just.''   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth on Friday claimedresponsibility for Higgins' kidnapping, charging he was a CIA spy.U.S. and U.N. officials denied the charge.   The group early Monday called on Berri to order his Amal militiato stop house raids and arrests in connection with Higgins'abduction.   ``The pretention that he is defending the U.N. peacekeepingforces in south Lebanon is not a viable excuse for rescuing anAmerican espionage agent,'' the group said in a typewrittenstatement delivered to the independent Beirut newspaper An-Naharjust after midnight.   ``We are lying in wait for any other suspicious American,'' theArabic language statement said.   Higgins, a decorated Vietnam veteran and a one-time militaryassistant to former U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, headsa 76-man observer group attached to a U.N. peacekeeping force insouth Lebanon. He was kidnapped on Wednesday near the ancient portcity of Tyre.   In Washington, President Reagan said Sunday night that ``we'redoing everything we can and exploring every avenue'' to freeHiggins.   Asked if he hoped to get all American hostages freed fromLebanon before he leaves office next January, the president said,``I'd like that better than anything else.''   ``It is such a terrible situation and you're afraid you'll dosomething that will harm them (the hostages). We don't know whothey (the captors) are or where they are,'' Reagan told reportersduring a reception at the White House for the National Governors'Association.   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella organization forpro-Iranian groups holding foreign hostages in Lebanon.   Ein el-Tineh, a Hezbollah stronghold, is 31 miles east of Tyre,where Hezbollah claims Amal has arrested more than 150 of itsmembers in connection with Higgins' abduction. Amal spokesmen sayonly 40 fundamentalists have been detained.   The abduction prompted the U.N.'s Interim Forces In Lebanon towithdraw 20 observers from Higgins' unit to its headquarters inNaqoura, near the Israel-Lebanon border, according to Timor Goksel,spokesman for the UNIFIL.   Goksel said the observers were withdrawn both for securityconcerns and to protest Higgins' abduction. The rest of theobserver group remained Sunday in positions overlooking Beirut'sgreen line, which divides the city into Moslem and Christiansectors, he said.   Goksel declined to comment on reports that U.N. troops hadabandoned checkpoints around Tyre.   Ten UNIFIL troops were withdrawn Thursday to Naqoura from anarea close to an Amal checkpoint on the Qassmieh highway bridgenorth of the city. But UNIFIL troops did not withdraw from any oftheir own checkpoints south and east of Tyre.   UNIFIL units and Amal militiamen, aided by helicopters and dogs,continued to search for Higgins Sunday in olive and citrus grovesand cave-lined valleys southeast of Tyre.   Berri has called Higgins' abduction a threat to the security ofthe predominantly Shiite population of south Lebanon. He said Amalwas bent on defending the U.N. peacekeeping force irrespective ofthe nationality of its officers.   Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, a Hezbollah leader in south Lebanon,was quoted by Beirut radio stations Sunday as saying he believesthe kidnappers have managed to smuggle Higgins out of the south.   Obeid told warshippers at a mosque in the southern village ofJibsheet that Higgins was in charge of UNIFIL's ``spyingoperations.''   As a condition of Higgins' release, the Oppressed on Earth hasdemanded that Israel withdraw from the security zone it carved outin south Lebanon when the bulk of its occupation army withdrew fromLebanon in 1985, ending a three-year invasion.   It also demanded the release of Lebanese and Palestinian inmatesheld at the Khiam detention camp in the security zone and inIsraeli jails.   An estimated 300 detainees are believed held at Khiam, run bymilitiamen of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army.   Higgins was the third U.N. official abducted in south Lebanon inthree weeks.   Jan Stening, 44, of Sweden and Willian Jorgensen, 58, of Norway,both employees of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency that cares forPalestinian refugees, were kidnapped Feb. 5 near Sidon, 25 milesnorth of Tyre.   There are 22 other foreigners missing in Lebanon. They are eightAmericans, four Frenchmen, three Britons, two West Germans, anItalian, an Indian and two unidentified men.   The longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.</TEXT></DOC>
