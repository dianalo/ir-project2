Thousands of people converged on Prague's central WenceslasSquare at 3 p.m., when independent groups had asked them to show upin a peaceful display of the popular desire for more freedom.   Cheers went up when banners saying: ``The truth will prevail,''and ``We will not let the republic be disrupted'' _ a popularCommunist slogan turned on its head by the demonstrators _ appearedin the crowd.   The crowd also chanted for Tomas Garrique Masaryk, thephilosopher who founded independent Czechoslovakia in 1918. TheCzechoslovak state came into existence on Oct. 28, 1918, with thedissolution of Austria-Hungary.   The Communists consolidated power in 1948, and Czechoslovakiaremains one of the Soviet bloc's most rigidly controlled socialiststates.   Riot police appeared in side streets about 20 minutes after thedemonstrations began and gradually moved in to disperse the crowd.   Some people were beaten with police batons as they were led awayto waiting buses dotted amid dozens of yellow-and-white riot policevans.   ``We want no violence,'' hundreds of people chanted as they werepenned in by riot police. ``We've got bare hands,'' they shoutedraising their arms to the sky to show police they were unarmed.   They also demanded free elections and a new government.   About 90 minutes after the demonstration began, clappingprotesters still intermittently shouted ``freedom'' as policesought to disperse them.   More than 2,000 of the demonstrators eventually made their wayto old town square, like Wenceslas square a historic gatheringplace for Czechs.   There they sang the national anthem and chanted more slogans forfreedom before helmeted riot police again moved in to disperse thecrowd.   The crowd was estimated at between 10,000 and 15,000, markingthe largest anti-government demonstration since August 1988, when10,000 people marched for more freedom on the 20th anniversary ofthe Soviet-led invasion that crushed reform in 1968.   Authorities had arrested at least 11 dissidents, includingHavel, to prevent them attending the independent rally. Butdissidents said other activists escaped the police dragnet andhoped to attend the protest.   Today's march was held shortly after the Communist governmentcelebrated the anniversary of independence with a military paradein Wenceslas Square. About 1,500 soldiers stood at attention asDefense Minister Gen. Milan Vaclavik instructed them to swearallegiance to their socialist homeland.   In a 15-minute speech, Josef Kempny, head of theCommunist-dominated Czech National Council, emphasized theimportance of preserving Communist rule. He reiterated thegovernment will not seek dialogue with opposition groups.   ``There is no sense in debate with those who like to talk, butwho oppose February 1948, and are against socialism, who care onlyfor the return of capitalism and who try to distract our honestworkers from their work and to create chaos,'' Kempny said.   His speech drew only scant applause from an estimated 3,000Czechoslovaks who received special cards to pass through policecordons and metal barriers for the ceremony.   Most attending appeared to be relatives of the soldiers, whoconcluded the ceremony marching past Kempny, Vaclavik, Prague partyboss Miroslav Stepan and other dignitaries. The officials stood ona reviewing stand draped in red cloth bearing the legend, ``Weserve the socialist homeland.''   Two rocket transporters carrying two missiles apiece and twoarmored personnel carriers were stationed on the square.   Last year, 5,000 people rallied on Oct. 28 and were dispersed byriot police using dogs, a water cannon, tear gas and batons. Atleast 87 people were arrested.   At the U.S. Embassy, Ambassador Shirley Temple Black made aveiled call for more freedom in Czechoslovakia in a brief speechbefore about 250 Czechoslovaks honoring Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, whofounded democratic Czechoslovakia.   Masaryk is now gradually being accorded a role in nationalhistory after being reviled for decades as a bourgeois capitalist.</TEXT></DOC>
