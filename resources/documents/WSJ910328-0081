Both the Pentagon and the White House bluntly disputed astatement by Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, head of U.S. forces inthe war against Iraq, that he had recommended continuing tobattle Iraq when President Bush ordered an end tohostilities. In an interview with David Frost on PBS, Gen.Schwarzkopf asserted: &quot;Frankly, my recommendation had been,you know, continue the march. I mean, we had them in a routand we could have continued to, you know, reap greatdestruction on them.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   A transcript of the interview, which was broadcast lastnight, became available early yesterday. Defense SecretaryDick Cheney promptly issued a bluntly worded statementdeclaring that the decision to cease fighting &quot;wascoordinated with and concurred in by the commander in thefield, Gen. Schwarzkopf.&quot; Similarly, White House officialsreiterated assertions that Gen. Schwarzkopf was consulted byphone from the Oval Office before Mr. Bush made the decisionto halt hostilities Feb. 27. And President Bush toldreporters: &quot;I have full confidence in Gen. Schwarzkopf. Butall I know is that there was total agreement in terms of whenthis war should end.&quot;   The administration's rapid response to the Schwarzkopfstatements may have reflected officials' eagerness to headoff critics' assertions that it should have gone further tofinish off Saddam Hussein while it had the chance. ThePentagon said Gen. Schwarzkopf doesn't plan to comment on thematter.   Gen. Schwarzkopf's remarks mystified and annoyedadministration officials, and the episode was an embarrassingblemish on the picture of internal unity the administrationhas projected. But Pentagon and White House aides played downthe long-term significance of the affair, noting that Gen.Schwarzkopf also said in the interview that he agreed thatall &quot;campaign objectives&quot; had been achieved by the war's end.   The flap came as U.S. officials said diplomats at theUnited Nations are within days of completing a formalcease-fire resolution that would put an internationalpeacekeeping force along a 15-mile stretch of land straddlingthe Iraq-Kuwait border. That, officials said, would open theway for a rapid pullout by American troops in southern Iraq.   The cease-fire resolution is being crafted privately bymembers of the U.N. Security Council. As currentlyconstructed, it would require the destruction of Iraq'schemical and biological weapons, a program to verify thedestruction, and the diversion of Iraqi oil revenues to paywar reparations.   Just as important to the Bush administration, theresolution would establish an international peace-keepingforce. Officials said the resolution contemplates a zone forthe peacekeeping force extending 10 miles inside Iraq andfive miles inside Kuwait.   U.S. officials said that as long as the peacekeeping forceis in place, the administration intends to withdraw itstroops from southern Iraq even if Iraq refuses to accept theU.N. cease-fire resolution. The troops could be pulled fromIraq within &quot;three to four days&quot; of the international force'sarrival, one administration aide said. It isn't clear whatcountries will provide troops for the peacekeeping force. Butofficials said that Norway has indicated it could have forcesin place quickly, and it is assumed that Arab nations such asEgypt and Syria will participate.   One factor that could delay a withdrawal is mountingevidence from intelligence sources and Iraqi refugees thatIraqi troops are using chemical weapons to suppress internalunrest. President Bush has said it would be difficult toconclude a formal cease-fire if Iraq is using chemicalweapons. But U.S. officials cautioned last night that thereisn't conclusive evidence that such weapons have been used.   President Bush himself acknowledged yesterday that he isyearning to get American troops out. &quot;I want to get ourforces back home as soon as I can, and I want to get them outof Iraq as soon as I can,&quot; Mr. Bush told reporters in aninformal question-and-answer session after his annualphysical examination. &quot;And I think you'll see that they'llcome out very fast when we get this cease-fire.&quot;   Mr. Bush also predicted the ultimate demise of Iraqileader Saddam Hussein, even if he survives the currentturmoil inside Iraq. &quot;With this much turmoil, it seems to meunlikely he can survive,&quot; Mr. Bush said. &quot;People are fed upwith him and see him for the brutal dictator he is.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
