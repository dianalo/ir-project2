The following summary also contains a list of submissions thatwere dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. <ITAG tagnum="84">Appeals</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Excell, Inc., 8/19/88, KFA-0202</T3>Excell, Inc., filed an Appeal from a denial by the Project Manager of theStrategic Petroleum Reserve Project Management Office (SPR) of a requestfor information that it had submitted under the Freedom of InformationAct. In its Appeal, Excell challenged the withholding of one document underExemption 5 of the FOIA. During the course of the Appeal before OHA, SPRdetermined that the document should have been withheld under Exemption4, rather than Exemption 5. The challenge with respect to the Exemption5 issue was therefore determined to be moot, and the Appeal was dismissed.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>International Union of Operating Engineers Local 101, 8/19/88, KFA-0205,KFA-0207, KFA-0208</T3>The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 101 filed three Appealsfrom denials of information by the Senior Information Officer of the Information,Publication and Planning Staff, and by the Deputy Director of the Officeof Governmental and External Affairs, of the DOE's Albuquerque OperationsOffice. The Appellant had filed three FOIA requests with Albuquerque seekingaccess to the weekly certified payroll records submitted by three subcontractorsfor work performed at the Bendix Plant in Kansas City, Missouri. In theirdeterminations, the Authorizing Officials released copies of all of therequested payroll records, but withheld the names and other identifyinginformation of the employees involved. The Authorizing Officials determinedthat the privacy interests of the employees far outweighed any possiblepublic interest to be served by release of the personal data to third parties.In considering the Appeals, the DOE determined that the release of thewithheld information would constitute an invasion of the employees' privacy.The DOE noted that the Appellant failed to indicate why it was seekingthe requested records, and that it did not state what public interest wouldbe served by releasing the information. In view of the fact that therewas no apparent or alleged public interest to balance against the seriousinvasion of personal privacy involved, the DOE denied the three Appeals.<ITAG tagnum="84">Implementation of Special Refund Procedures</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>MCO Holdings/MGPC, 8/16/88, KEF-0108</T3>The DOE issued a Final Decision and Order implementing Special Refund Proceduresfor the distribution of $715,420.48 pursuant to a consent order enteredinto between the DOE and MCO Holdings and its wholly owned subsidiary,McCullogh Gas Processing Corporation (MGPC). The DOE determined that thesefunds should be distributed to purchasers of MGPC natural gas liquids andnatural gas liquid products from June 13, 1973 through the applicable dateof decontrol. The decision established presumptions of injury for end-users,resellers whose claims are for $5,000 or less, and regulated firms. A 60percent presumption of injury was established for medium range (5,000 to50,000) claimants. The specific application procedures are set forth inthe Decision. <ITAG tagnum="84">Refund Applications</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Getty Oil Company, Kandamp;K Oil Co., Inc., 8/19/88, RF265-1108</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundfiled by a firm that operated as a consignee agent of Getty motor gasolineduring the consent order period. We determined that the applicant demonstratedthat it experienced a decline in its share for motor gasoline, and thereforewas injured as a result of Getty's pricing practices. The total refundapproved in this Decision is $14,718, representing $7,187 in principaland $7,531 in accrued interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Getty Oil Company, Stender Oil Company, 8/19/88, RF265-2622 </T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundfiled by a firm that operated as a consignee agent of Getty motor gasolineduring the consent order period. We determined that the applicant demonstratedthat it experienced a decline in its market share for motor gasoline, andtherefore was injured as a result of Getty's pricing practices. The totalrefund approved in this Decision is $2,434 representing $1,189 in principaland $1,245 in accrued interest. <ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Getty Oil Company/Zitek Skelly Service, et al., 8/19/88, RF265-381,et al. </T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning six Applications for Refundfiled by resellers or retailers of products covered by a consent orderthat the DOE entered into with the Getty Oil Company. Each applicant submittedinformation indicating the volume of Getty gasoline, middle distillateor propane products purchased from Getty during the consent ordered period.In four claims, the applicants were eligible for a refund below the smallclaims threshold of $5,000. In the remaining three claims, the applicantselected to limit their claims to $5,000. The total amount of the refundsapproved in the Decision and Order is $42,943, representing $20,989 inprincipal and $21,954 in accrued interest. <ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Howell Oil Company, 8/19/88, RF272-12845 </T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order denying an application for a crudeoil refund filed by the Howell Oil Company (Howell), which sold motor gasoline,middle distillates, oils, and naptha during the crude oil settlement period(August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981). The DOE determined that Howellwas ineligible to receive a refund because it failed to demonstrate thatit was injured by the crude oil overcharges. <ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>James Valley Co-op Union, 8/17/88, RF272-74609 </T3>The DOE issued a Supplemental Order to correct an error made in <T3>Dale's Mobil Service,</T3> 17 DOE andpara; ____, Nos. RF272-44164, <T3>et al.</T3> (July 21, 1988), in which we denied James Valley Co-opUnion (JVCU) a refund. As an agricultural cooperative, JVCU is eligiblefor a refund if it certifies that it will pass through the refund to itscustomers. JVCU met this requirement, and therefore was granted a refundin the amount of $3,825. <ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Marathon Petroleum Company/Gas'N Save, 8/18/88, RF250-2462, RF250-2463</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for refundfiled by Gas'n'Save in the Marathon Petroleum Company refund proceeding.Gas'n'Save, a retailer of Marathon products, submitted information attemptingto establish that it was injured by Marathon's alleged overcharges andthat it was therefore entitled to its full volumetric refund of $14,734.Upon reviewing the data filed by the firm, the DOE determined that theprice comparison data used by Gas'n'Save applied to refinery and terminalprices, rather than to wholesale prices that the firm would have likelypaid for the product. The DOE found that the prices Gas'n'Save paid Marathonwere generally lower than average wholesale proces in the firm's marketarea. Accordingly, Gas'n'Save was granted a refund of 95 percent of itsvolumetric share or $5,157 plus $774 in interest. <ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Marathon Petroleum Co./Oakland County Gas andamp; Oil Co., 8/16/88, RF250-2473,RF250-2774</T3>This Decision and Order concerns Applications for Refund filed by the OaklandGas and Oil Company in the Marathon Petroleum Company refund proceeding.The DOE found that the firm sustained a competitive injury as a resultof Marathon's alleged overcharges. Oakland was granted a refund of $4,288plus $643 in accrued interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp./Bell Oil Company, R.F. Brennan Distributing, Inc.,8/17/88, RF225-9649, RF225-9650, RF225-9808, RF225-9809, RF225-9810, RF225-9811</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting Applications for Refund filedby the Bell Oil Company and R.F. Brennan Distributing, Inc. in the MobilOil Corp. special refund proceeding. <T3>Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985). Each firm attemptedto rebut the level-of-distribution presumptions for its purchases of Mobilmotor gasoline. In support of its claim, each firm submitted cost banksthat it approximated from firm-wide annual revenue data. The DOE concludedthat these annual cost banks were an inadequate basis for rebutting thelevel-of-distribution presumptions. In the Mobil proceeding, however, anapplicant that fails in its attempt to rebut the level-of-distributionpresumptions is still eligible for a refund. Accordingly, Bell was granteda presumption-level refund of $5,000, in principal, and Brennan a refundof $2,075, in principal. The total amount of refunds granted was $8,835,representing $7,075 in principal and $1,760 in accrued interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp./Don Foster Oil Company, 8/17/88, RF225-9664</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refundfiled by Don Foster Oil Co. in the Mobil Oil Corp. Special Refund Proceeding.<T3>Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985). Foster, a reseller/retailerof refined petroleum products, attempted to rebut the level-of-distributionpresumption for its purchases of Mobil motor gasoline. After examiningthe firm's cost banks and applying a three-part competitive disadvantagetest, the DOE concluded that Foster should receive a full volumetric refundon its purchases. The total refund granted to Foster was $5,639, representing$4,516 in principal and $1,123 in accrued interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp./Galchutt Oil Company, 8/19/88, RF225-9714, RF225-9715,RF225-9716</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order regarding a refund application filedby the Galchutt Oil Company in the Mobil Oil Corporation special refundproceeding. In its application, Galchutt stated that it operated as anagricultural cooperative during the consent order period and requestedthat its entire claim be evaluated as if it acted as an end-user in itssales of Mobil product to both its members and nonmembers. To substantiateits request, Galchutt submitted a copy of its Articles of Incorporationwhich state that all profits of its cooperative be distributed equallyto members and nonmembers. In this way, any refund received would be distributedto both groups. The DOE found that this unusual method of distributinga cooperative's profits to nonmembers as well as members constituted anexception to the general method of evaluating a cooperative's claim atthe retailer's level of injury when there are sales to nonmembers. We thereforedetermined that Galchutt's entire claim be treated as purchases made byan end-user. In accordance with the procedures outlined in <T3>Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985), Galchutt was granteda refund totalling $1,942 ($1,555 in principal plus $387 in accrued interest).<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corporation/Marine Corps Exchange Service, 8/19/88, RF225-7733</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refundfiled by the Marine Corps Exchange Service (the Exchange in the Mobil OilCorp. refund proceeding, <T3>Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985). In its Application,the Exchange claimed that Mobil had improperly discontinued a discountit was required to provide to the Exchange under the Mandatory PetroleumPrice Regulations. As a result, the Exchange stated that it had experiencedan alleged injury of $.0439 per gallon on regular and unleaded motor gasolinepurchased and an injury of $.0589 per gallon on premium motor gasolinepurchased between April 1, 1974 and December 30, 1980. The DOE found that,having demonstrated that its discount had been discontinued, the Exchangehad rebutted the volumetric presumption and had shown that it had experienceda disproportionate injury. The DOE also found that, because the Exchangewas required to price its motor gasoline without regard to its purchaseprice, Mobil's pricing practices probably resulted in a loss of revenuefor the Exchange during the relevant period. Based on these determinations,the DOE concluded that the Exchange was eligible to receive a refund of$2,872,024, representing $2,299,908 in principal plus $572,116 in interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Sysco Food System, 8/17/88, RF272-74608</T3>The DOE issued a Supplemental Order to correct an error made in <T3>Dale's Mobil Service, </T3>17 DOE andpara; ___, Nos. RF272-44164, <T3>et al. </T3>(July 21, 1988), in which the Sysco Food System (Sysco)was granted a refund as a reseller. However, Sysco was actually a foodjobber and should be granted a refund in the amount of $987.Crude Oil End-Users The Office of Hearings and Appeals granted crude oil overcharge refundsto end-user applicants in the following Decisions and Orders: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,tp0,i1,s220,xls56,8,7,7</C> <H1>Name </H1><H1>Case No. </H1><H1>Date </H1><H1>Number of applicants </H1><H1>Total refund</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Allen May Farms, et al <D>RF272-35000 </D><D>8/16/88 </D><D>166 </D><D>$4,338</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Betty Lou Sweeting, et al <D>RF272-38400 </D><D>8/18/88 </D><D>163 </D><D>4,124</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bianchi Brothers Inc. et al <D>RF272-13601 </D><D>8/18/88 </D><D>183 </D><D>3,483</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bob Abernathy et al <D>RF272-10306 </D><D>8/16/88 </D><D>91 </D><D>2,355</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">City of Mitchell et al <D>RF272-15801 </D><D>8/16/88 </D><D>132</D><D>3,912</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Clyde Bartholomew, Jr., et al <D>RF272-3533 </D><D>8/16/88 </D><D>109 </D><D>5,435</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cook, Inc., et al <D>RF272-33800 </D><D>8/18/88 </D><D>181 </D><D>4,021</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Eugene D.
