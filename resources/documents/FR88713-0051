The natural gas pipeline facilities covered in the FEIS include a totalof 25.5 miles of 30-inch diameter looping in 5 separate segments locatedadjacent to existing gas transmission pipelines in New York and Massachusetts,and approximately 11 miles of new 20-inch-diameter pipeline in Massachusettsand Rhode Island. The FEIS includes analysis of an additional 7,700 horsepowerof compression at 3 existing compressor stations in New York and Massachusetts,and a new 4,500 horsepower compressor station in New York.
