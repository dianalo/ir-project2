The EPA's risk estimates will be sent to other federal agencies for their use in considering whether to impose tighter limits on formaldehyde emissions in workplaces and from such products as mobile homes and pressed-wood products.    The assessment was the most extensive and comprehensive study yet on formaldehyde risks, EPA officials said. As many as two in 10,000 people who move into an average, new mobile home and stay in it 10 years are likely to get cancer from breathing formaldehyde vapors, the study found. For certain garment workers, it said, the cancer risk could be as high as three in 10,000.    Federal agencies have been on notice about possible health risks from formaldehyde at least since 1980, and some already have acted to curb exposure. In 1984, the Department of Housing and Urban Development imposed limits on formaldehyde emissions from particleboard and plywood in mobile homes. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has said it plans to lower its workplace exposure standard. And the Consumer Product Safety Commission is studying setting standards for consumer products, including pressed-wood products.    EPA officials said their risk estimates are similar to calculations that other agencies have been relying on. Charles Elkins, head of EPA's office of toxic substances, said his agency would move to regulate if it concluded that other agencies weren't doing enough. &quot;We are concerned about this level of risk, and we're going to be looking at it very seriously,&quot; he said.    The EPA found that laboratory tests have shown that formaldehyde causes cancer in animals. Evidence that it causes cancer in humans is &quot;limited,&quot; the agency said. Nine of 28 studies of humans exposed to formaldehyde reported statistically significant excess cancers, the agency concluded.    The Formaldehyde Institute, a trade association of makers and users of formaldehyde products, disagreed. Institute President John Murray said that formaldehyde &quot;shouldn't be regarded as any kind of cancer risk to humans.&quot; He said the government hasn't found cancer clusters among highly exposed people, and he claimed human studies fail to prove the chemical causes cancer.    Jerry Connors, president of the Manufactured Housing Institute, a mobile home industry trade association, dismissed the report as &quot;flimsy and inadequately done science.&quot; He argued that the HUD standard for mobile homes &quot;has been extremely effective in protecting the home buying public against rather questionable (health) effects.&quot;    According to Mr. Elkins, U.S. exposures to formaldehyde already have declined significantly. The main exposure source is from mobile or stationary homes that are relatively new, since formaldehyde emissions from building products fade with time, he said.    Makers of pressed-wood products using formaldehyde-based glues have reduced their emissions of the chemical or switched to substitute glues. Installation of formaldehyde foam home insulation all but stopped in the wake of a short ban on the product in 1981 by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
