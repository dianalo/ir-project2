<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-23-0641 </DOCNO><TEXT>Dielectric films with thickness of the order of 50 A are obtained at roomtemperature by bombarding exposed silicon surfaces with an oxygen-containingion beam of energy 60 eV. Silicon nitride thin films have also been formedusing the same technique. The film thickness is self-limited and largelyindependent of ion dose. AES and XPS analysis of the produced thin filmsindicate that the films are not entirely stoichiometric and contain loweroxidation states of silicon. The high electrical quality of the oxidefilms is demonstrated by the successful fabrication of n-channel MOStransistors with gate dielectrics obtained by ion beam oxidation at roomtemperature.</TEXT></DOC>
