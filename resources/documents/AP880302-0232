CAMPBELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than 60 anti-apartheid demonstrators werearrested Wednesday following a peaceful protest in front of theSouth African embassy.   The arrests followed a rally protesting the South Africangovernment's decision to outlaw public dissent, which led to thearrest last week of Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop DesmondTutu in Johannesburg.   Randall Robinson, a leader of the Free South Africa Movementwhich has organized similar protests at the South African embassysince 1984, told a crowd of about 300 people that the demonstrationmarked ``the beginning of a new phase of the battle againstapartheid.''   The rally was held down the street from the embassy to avoidviolation of a District of Columbia ordinance prohibitingdemonstrations within 500 feet of foreign embassies.   Following remarks by members of Congress, representives from theNational Organization for Women, the AFL-CIO and other groups, agroup of ``messengers'' approached the embassy.   Among those arrested were Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.; Del. WalterFauntroy, D-D.C.; U.S. Civil Rights Commissioner Mary F. Berry; andRobinson, who heads TransAfrica, a Washington-based lobbying groupon Africa and the Caribbean.   Robinson said the Free South Africa Movement would continue topush for complete disinvestment of U.S. firms in South Africa andurge Congress to enact stronger sanctions.   He said America needs to move ``the U.N. Security Council towardglobal sanctions and a president who will take the lead with ourallies ...to totally isolate South Africa.''   Robinson said he hoped the new wave of protests would forcepresidential candidates to take a public position on South Africa.He said only Jesse Jackson has been vocal on the issue thus far.</TEXT></DOC>
