WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The East German Parliament today votedoverwhelmingly to change the constitution and eliminate theCommunist Party's guaranteed monopoly on power, a major reformdemanded by the mass movement for democratic change.   While at least five lawmakers voted to abstain, the rest in the500-member People's Chamber appeared in a show of hands to approvethe change.   It is the latest in a series of reforms announced since thehard-line Communist government was ousted by mass protests on Oct.18.   The new Communist leadership bowed to continued pressure and anexodus of citizens to the West on Nov. 9 when it opened its bordersand the Berlin Wall to allow free travel to the West.   The vote on the constitutional change came as a surprise.   Parliament speaker Guenther Maleuda opened the session 40minutes late and announced that the party leaders had met to changethe agenda and put the issue of Communist domination as their firstorder of business.   There was no debate on the issue. The lawmakers broke intoapplause after the vote.   The Christian Democratic Union, one of the smaller parties thathad been allied with the Communists during the past 40 years,proposed striking the constitution's designation of East Germany asa ``socialist nation,'' but that motion failed to win the neededtwo-thirds majority of votes.   Only 112 deputies from among the 420 present voted in favor and20 others abstained.   Many Communists as well as opposition activists have called formaintaining the socialist nature of East Germany and rejected WestGerman calls for reunification of the countries, divided after theNazi defeat in World War II.   The leader of another small party, Guenter Hartmann of theNational Democrats, told East German television that all of theparty leaders agreed on the need to consider a constitutionalchange involving the Communists' monopoly on power.   East German politicians had been considering striking Article 1from the constitution, which guarantees the Communists a ``leadingrole.''   Today's vote may have been spurred by the swift decision inneighboring Czechoslovakia this week to also change theconstitutional provision guaranteeing the Communists a monopoly onpower.   The Czechoslovak Parliament voted unanimously Wednesday torepeal the constitutional designation of the Communists as theleading force.   Maleuda said at the start of the East German parliamentarysession that a simple two-thirds majority of the members' votes wasneeded to change the constitution.   Opposition groups had demanded such a revision, and even theCommunists have conceded they should give up the unfair advantage.   ``This kind of change would be a good beginning,'' Hartmann toldEast German television.   The next step in advancing political pluralism will comeThursday when the Communists sit down with opposition groups todetermine the nation's future course.   The Parliament later debated a proposed law that would guaranteeall citizens the right to travel and provide for a way to supplythem with hard currency for trips to the West.   But Finance Minister Uta Nickel told the chamber that theexchange system was being delayed by ``considerable problems.'' Shesaid the government was not prepared to discuss a guaranteedminimum exchange for private trips for at least another three weeks.   The constitutional change temporarily took attention away from acriminal investigation into alleged abuse of power by former EastGerman leader Erich Honecker and other ousted officials.   ``The party must completely and decisively reject such misuse ofoffice to earn the trust of the people,'' Communist Party leaderEgon Krenz said on national television after the investigation wasannounced Thursday.   Honecker also was stripped of immunity from prosecution, and theofficial news agency ADN reported that the country estates ofHonecker and his top associates were under tight security toprevent removal of valuable or evidence.   Krenz, who was considered a follower of Honecker's and ahard-liner before he replaced his old mentor, faces widespreadopposition among pro-democracy activists as well as within theparty hierarchy, which is to meet in a special congress Dec. 15-17.   Krenz said he hoped the disgraced officials could be brought tojustice before the party congress.   He also contended he had never kept quarters at exclusivehunting lodges set aside for the party elite.   An internal party inquiry was announced a week ago into reportedwrongdoing by Honecker, his deputy Guenter Mittag and other topCommunists.   Mittag was thrown out of the party Nov. 23 in the first punitiveaction against any ousted official.   Opposition activists accuse party leaders during Honecker's18-year regime of lining their pockets while the national economyfaltered.   Honecker, 77, has not been seen in public since his ouster sixweeks ago. He is reported to be seriously ill.</TEXT></DOC>
