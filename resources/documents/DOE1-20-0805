There have been over35 projects cooperatively sponsored by the Earthquake Studies Protocolin the past 5 years. The projects are organized into seven annexes, includinginvestigations in earthquake prediction, intraplate faults and earthquakes,earthquake engineering and hazards investigation, deep crustal structure,rock mechanics, seismology, and data exchange. Operational earthquakeprediction experiments are currently being developed at two primary sites:western Yunnan Province near the town of Xiaguan, where there are severalactive faults, and the northeast China plain, where the devastating 1976Tangshan earthquake occurred.</TEXT></DOC>
