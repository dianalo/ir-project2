After surrendering to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents Friday, 50-year-old Jacobo Finkieland released on a $30 million bond secured by Manhattan real estate.    Mr. Finkielstain's attorney, Charles A. Stillman, said his client will fight the charges. &quot;People should not jump to conclusions until the whole story is gathered,&quot; Mr. Stillman said. &quot;The full story will show Jackie, Mr. Finkielstain, innocent of any wrongdoing.&quot;    As previously reported, Central National on Sept. 11 was declared insolvent by the comptroller of the currency and over-the-counter trading in its shares was suspended. The bank had $170 million in deposits in 13,400 accounts.    An FBI criminal complaint released by U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani alleges that among the reasons for the bank's failure was the apparent diversion of bank funds from about 21 customer accounts. Most of the accounts were controlled by residents of Argentina, where Mr. Finkielstain reportedly has a residence, the complaint states.    Mr. Finkielstain was charged with defrauding the bank of the money by booking bogus repurchase agreements to the 21 accounts unbeknownst to the customers. The repurchase agreements -- or customers' sales of securities to the bank with the agreement to repurchase them later with interest -- purported to be secured by Argentine dollar-denominated bonds. But the complaint charges that such bonds were never actually delivered, and that the money from the repurchase agreements was allegedly sent to Swiss bank accounts and others controlled by Mr. Finkielstain.    If convicted, Mr. Finkielstain faces a maximum five years in prison and $250,000 fine. The FDIC is paying off insured depositors of the bank. </TEXT></DOC>
