It's oftensuggested that young, educated and affluent blacks are fed upwith social deterioration, and are therefore ready to ditchthe drive for preferential treatment in favor of moreindependent approaches to resolving social ills. In fact, itis black professionals, and those who aspire to join theirranks, who are among the strongest supporters of the mainlinecivil-rights organizations.   College senior Jason Hill is bemused by reports to thecontrary. An undergraduate at Georgia State University, Mr.Hill has written for national newspapers about the ferventsupport of his black peers for affirmative action and quotas:&quot;They reject Thomas because they think he's againstaffirmative action and quotas, and they want to keep both ofthese policies in place.&quot; Just days before the Thomasnomination, Mr. Hill asked a friend whether he would care ifthe justice nominated to succeed Thurgood Marshall were notblack. The response was that, yes, he cared very much. Theday after Mr. Bush's announcement, however, Mr. Hill's friendwas clearly displeased. &quot;So, I asked if he would prefer awhite liberal instead. He didn't want that either. He wasreally torn.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   College-educated blacks have the most at stake in theracial preference programs that have been extracted by theprotest and advocacy of civil-rights groups. They regardaffirmative action as essential to crashing the corporate&quot;glass ceiling,&quot; which supposedly keeps them from topexecutive positions.   Similarly, a great many black businessmen see racialset-aside contracts as crucial to their success. Their causeis championed by the growing numbers of black networkingassociations and business-oriented newsletters and magazines.For instance, Earl Graves, publisher of Black Enterprisemagazine, recently added a department to the magazine called&quot;Affirmative Action Watch.&quot;   Walter Bowie, a clergyman in Jackson, Miss., is asupporter of Mr. Thomas who finds that it is theprofessionals in his congregation who are most likely tooppose the nomination. He considers typical the attitude of apre-law student who attends his church. This student, claimsMr. Bowie, is &quot;completely in the sway of the teachings ofcivil-rights organizations. He doesn't think beyond whateverthey project.&quot;   Mr. Bowie, however, is campaigning to introduce hisparishioners to alternative ideas. He regularly distributesreading material to the group and other blacks he meets inhis work, in an effort to broaden their knowledge, especiallyon matters of public policy. &quot;There needs to be a way tobreak through the mindset, which is frightening to me,&quot; Mr.Bowie says.   Mr. Bowie describes the indignation he felt when he readRobert Bork's account (in &quot;The Tempting of America&quot;) of Sen.Edward Kennedy's call in the middle of the night to the Rev.Joseph Lowery, head of the Southern Christian LeadershipConference, to urge Mr. Lowery to organize blacks againstJudge Bork. The next day at the SCLC convention meeting inNew Orleans, Mr. Lowery not only galvanized those inattendance to oppose the Bork nomination, but set in motion acampaign that reached hundreds of black ministers and theirchurches across the country. Mr. Bowie says, &quot;It alarmed megreatly that a politician like Kennedy could get all of usupset and disturbed about something we really had notinvestigated for ourselves.&quot; Mr. Bowie fears a repetition ofthat precedent in the case of Clarence Thomas.   George Subira, the author of several well-receivedbusiness books directed to blacks, is known for his franknessin discussing the black leadership's failure to encouragegreater entrepreneurial activity among blacks. In theintroduction to his book &quot;Getting Black Folks to Sell,&quot; hecalls on blacks to recognize that they now have &quot;morepossibilities for their lives than any generation of blacks.&quot;On the Thomas nomination Mr. Subira reflects, &quot;We have hadthe plans and actions and strategies of blacks who have takenthe traditional approach for many years. It would beinteresting at this point just to see and even risk what ablack conservative point of view could net as benefits to ourpeople.&quot;   Paul Battle heads Washington Innercity Self-Help, agrassroots housing advocacy group. He observes skepticism andeven apprehension among his membership toward the Thomasnomination. His concern, which he claims reflects that ofmost in WISH, is the degree to which Mr. Thomas believes in alimited role for government. Mr. Battle asks, &quot;If thegovernment is going to stay out of our lives in terms ofassisting us, how about in areas of regulation, where we needthem?&quot; In his daily work, he finds a certain resignationamong blacks regarding Mr. Thomas. &quot;The attitude seems to bethat if we err, let's err on the side of our self-interest,and they think it's in our self-interest to have a person ofcolor.&quot;   There are some prominent blacks, however, who are moreenthusiastic about the nomination of Clarence Thomas, notablytelevision journalist Tony Brown. Mr. Brown writes a columncarried in many black newspapers, and is one of the mostsought-after speakers on the talk circuit. He has alwaysmanaged to remain fraternally linked to the traditionalcivil-rights organizations, even though he has frequentlyblasted their leadership with scathing criticism. A pioneerin promoting black enterprise, Mr. Brown has worked hard tomake blacks more conscious of the connection betweenneighborhood business development and social progress.   In an hourlong radio broadcast last week on a Baltimorestation, Mr. Brown denounced the Congressional Black Caucusfor &quot;unfurling their partisan colors&quot; in their rejection ofMr. Thomas. He then hurled this challenge at the caucus: &quot;Idon't believe the caucus has the clout to organize blackAmerica. I don't think you can do it. You're not evenpowerful enough in the Senate, where you have a Democraticmajority, to get the members of your own party to put outClarence Thomas. Where do you get the power to organize 30million black folks, when only 27% of them agree with you? Idare you to come out here and do it.&quot;   Mr. Brown confounded his opponents and admirers when heannounced in a column earlier this year his intention to jointhe Republican Party. In a Friday interview, Mr. Browncomplained of the peculiar ambivalence which enables anindividual black openly to indentify himself as a&quot;conservative,&quot; while advocating special privilege. Mr. Brownfound this contradiction especially prevalent among the blackleadership. &quot;You have John Jacob of the National Urban Leaguetalking about `self-help' in one breath, and then the nextday espousing the need for a so-called Marshall Plan forblack communities.&quot;   Mr. Brown noted Jesse Jackson's judicious references to&quot;self-help&quot; at the National Association for the Advancementof Colored People's annual conference in Houston earlier thismonth and complained that leaders like Mr. Jackson &quot;indictClarence Thomas and then take his philosophy.&quot; He accusesprominent blacks of a &quot;crude intellectual fascism when ablack strays from the liberal plantation.&quot; &quot;It's time for usto challenge these people and force them out into the open.&quot;   Mr. Brown believes the polls to be accurate that showlarge numbers of blacks ignoring the civil-rights leadershipto support the Thomas nomination. He claims that theleadership failed to take the negative posture it would havepreferred on the Thomas nomination because they knew &quot;theycouldn't get it past the membership.&quot; In this he sees greathope.   The ambivalence and contradictions blacks feel towardClarence Thomas might be seen merely as a response to hisachievements. However, the unwillingness of both the NationalUrban League and NAACP to take a stand against Mr. Thomasindicates that the USA Today poll caught something meaningfulin the mood of blacks. Fewer of them are satisfied to playthe role of rubber stamp to black leaders' dictates.   Conservative blacks ought to be cautious in their hopes.Nevertheless, Tony Brown's hopes are shared by conservativeblacks who have battled for years to be heard, and who arenow praying that the polls are indeed an accurate reflectionof impending change among blacks. To the pollsters, blackconservatives are intoning, &quot;From your samplings to God'sears.&quot;   ---   Ms. Wright is the editor of Issues andamp; Views, a New Yorknewsletter that addresses issues of black self-help.</TEXT></DOC>
