But the commission ruled against such penalty duties on the imports from Israel.    The panel found that, in most of the cases, imports of so-called &quot;standard&quot; carnations are harming U.S. commercial flower producers.    Officials said the trade panel will issue its final rulings later in several other cases, involving flower imports from Mexico, Kenya and Peru.    Dumping involves selling products here at unfairly low prices -- either below their prices in their countries of origin or below their cost of production. Countervailing duties are imposed to offset subsidies by foreign governments.    The Commerce Department had determined earlier that imports of fresh-cut flowers from about a dozen countries have either been sold to U.S. importers at unfairly low prices in violation of the anti-dumping act or that the exports have been subsidized by foreign governments. </TEXT></DOC>
