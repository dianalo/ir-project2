Reubin Askew of Florida, the reluctant frontrunner in his state's U.S. Senate race, unexpectedly abandoned his campaign, saying he was spending too much time raising money.    Mr. Askew endorsed Rep. Buddy MacKay, a moderate Democrat who is expected to announce his candidacy today. The contest to succeed Democratic Sen. Lawton Chiles, who is retiring after three terms, is important to Republicans and Democrats in the battle for control of the Senate.    Mr. Askew, who was governor from 1971 to 1979 and briefly ran for president in 1984, said he had &quot;underestimated the time and effort (raising money) would take.&quot; His campaign had raised $1 million of the $5.7 million that his advisers estimated they would need for the race.    After Sen. Chiles announced his retirement in December, Mr. Askew at first said he didn't want to run for the Senate. He reluctantly became a candidate only after state party leaders urged him to do so.    Mr. Askew's surprise withdrawal is expected to attract new entrants to the race, in addition to Mr. MacKay. More politicians from both parties -- possibly including former Sen. Paula Hawkins and Rep. Bill McCollum, both Republicans, and Democratic Rep. Lawrence Smith -- could join Republican Rep. Connie Mack III and Democratic Rep. Daniel Mica as announced candidates.    The state's primary will be Sept. 6. </TEXT></DOC>
