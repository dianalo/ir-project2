Indeed, it is possibleto note an historical pattern of one major world crisiscoinciding with others. During the Suez crisis in 1956, theSoviet Union invaded Hungary. The year 1962 saw the Cubanmissile crisis and China's invasion of India. And in thetraumas of 1968, the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia, twoAmerican leaders were assassinated and a coup in Iraq broughtthe Baath Party into power.   --- Counterrevolution in Moscow                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   The Soviet landscape is littered with the careers,governments and now bodies of people who once believed inMikhail Gorbachev. He has turned to force in the Baltics.(And to economic desperation in Moscow, where hisrenunciation of much of his own currency will only deepeneconomic turmoil.) The West, from Bonn to Washington, nowmust quickly reassess its goals.   It is ironic to think that the fulcrum for this exerciseis a swath of three tiny nations -- Lithuania, Latvia andEstonia. Captive and forgotten for 40 years, they have stungthe Soviet bear and he is roaring. The Soviet president fretsthat if he lets the three go, the empire will unravel. Forthe West, do the tiny Baltics matter?   To begin with, the West -- for example the U.S. StateDepartment -- has never recognized Stalin's incorporation ofthese once independent nations into the Soviet Union. Thereare of course limits to what the West can do for buddingdemocracy in the Soviet republics. But the West's historicposition is that the Baltics are less like the Ukraine orKazakhstan than like Poland or Czechoslovakia. We have clungto this principle since 1940, through the World War IIalliance, Yalta and the Cold War. This is no time to abandonit.   If &quot;the West&quot; means a political culture of democraticliberalism, there is a principled case for standing by thedemocratically elected parliaments of the Baltic States. Butin this instance high principle and geopolitical realism arejoined.   There are still 50,000 Soviet troops in Poland, remember,and an enormous presence of 300,000 troops in easternGermany. Somehow negotiations to remove them have brokendown, at least on the troops in Poland. The Soviet commanderthere recently asserted that the departure timetable insistedon by Lech Walesa's government is not possible, that histroops won't be out before the Soviet army finally leavesGermany -- in 1994.   Last Thursday President Walesa told his Parliament thatPoland faces &quot;a deadly threat&quot; and his spokesman publiclyraised the question of whether the Soviets might use the Gulfwar as a pretext for re-establishing control in EasternEurope.   If the West consigns the Baltics to the bear's bloody hug,momentum will be lost and a precedent established. If Sovietrepression of the Baltics proves costless, thecounterrevolutionaries in Moscow will seek to reverse thehistoric gains in Eastern Europe.   --- The Tiananmen Twilight                                                                                                          Horror stories spilling out of the communist world thispast week remind us that Saddam Hussein is not the only loosecannon of the 1990s, and certainly not the biggest. Communismin China and the Soviet Union is by now discredited anddespised, but it is not dead and it is clearly dangerous. InChina this month, some two dozen leaders of the 1989Tiananmen Square protest movement have been enduring trialsbehind closed doors.   The &quot;crimes&quot; of these dissidents, such as Liu Xiabo or RenWanding, were that they advocated freedom for the 1.1 billionpeople of China. Their trials and those of the others are aquiet extension of the same Chinese army assault on Beijingthat the world found so repellent 19 months ago.   No outsiders are allowed to attend the trials and judgmentwill be rendered not by a jury but by a three-judge tribunal.There is virtually no chance that the defendants can achievea verdict of innocence. The aim of the presiding ChineseCommunist Party is to preserve the power and privileges ofcadres whose methods hark back to Stalin. The Chinese party'sloss of tolerance in Tiananmen Square in 1989 is nowproducing its awful echo in the &quot;black beret&quot; paratroopercrackdown on the Baltic independence movement.   It has long been the hope in the West that communism couldsomehow be moderated gradually and calmly into a civilizedand open form of government. That hope has been at least partof the rationale for the resumption since Tiananmen Square ofWestern aid to China, including World Bank loans and friendlydiplomacy, such as President Bush's reception in Washingtonlast month of China's foreign minister, Qian Qichen. Similarthinking advocates the extension of U.S. help now to Vietnam.   Faced with slipping control over citizens who are fed upwith communist waste, corruption and repression, China'sparty of power demonstrates that it does not want thepeople's advice, but their silence.   ---   The Keating Three                                                                                                          January 15, the Persian Gulf deadline, was also the dateof the final summation of the Keating Five case by specialcounsel Robert Bennett. January 16, when American planes andcruise missiles battered the Iraqi military, was the date thepublic hearings closed. The nation's attention naturallyfocused on the war.   The lack of publicity was unfortunate, we suppose, forSenators John McCain (R., Ariz.) and John Glenn (D., Ohio).Mr. Bennett recommended they be cleared. But the burst of warpublicity overwhelmed his recommendation for action againstthe other three: Alan Cranston (D., Calif.), Dennis DeConcini(D., Ariz.) and Don Riegle (D., Mich.). All had acceptedlarge campaign contributions from Charles Keating andattended the infamous 1987 meeting of the five Senators withregulators delving into Mr. Keating's business. All arguedthat their actions were merely &quot;constituent service,&quot; notimproper influence.   To step back to the basics: Mr. Keating openly said hewanted senatorial help &quot;to get the regulators off my back.&quot;Four Senators met on his behalf with thrift regulator EdGray. Then five met with San Francisco regulators in chargeof the case. Danny Wall, a self-described &quot;son of theSenate,&quot; was retained as thrift regulator through what waslater ruled an unconstitutional procedure.   Mr. Keating is now the subject of criminal investigationby almost every level of government. A federal grand jury isprobing his affairs, and the Resolution Trust Corp. has fileda $1 billion suit against him. The state of California hasindicted him on 28 counts of fraud and financialmanipulation. Many are related to the sale of worthless,uninsured debentures issued by Lincoln Savings's parentcompany. Salesmen for the debentures were given writteninstructions that &quot;the weak, the meek and the ignorant areour natural targets.&quot; Many elderly victims were steered intobuying the risky debentures only after they were told itwould be unwise to renew their insured Lincoln CDs.   It seems, to be charitable, that the Senators didn't knowthe constituent they served.   Mr. Bennett recommended no action against Senators McCainand Glenn primarily because they broke relations with Mr.Keating after the five-Senator meeting, when the SanFrancisco regulators revealed they were referring the case tothe Justice Department for a criminal probe. Mr. Riegle'sonly proven subsequent involvement was a negotiation over apossible new fund-raiser, but his testimony in the case isdubious. Initially he said he didn't remember a two-day visitto Keating headquarters, and other witnesses contradicted histestimony that he did not arrange the first senatorialmeeting.   Senators Cranston and DeConcini were unremitting on Mr.Keating's behalf, even after learning there was evidence thatMr. Keating might be a crook. Senator Cranston arranged acrucial meeting between Mr. Wall and Mr. Keating, and theSenator's banking aide threatened regulators with hearingsunless a negotiated settlement was altered to meet all ofLincoln's demands.   Two days before the Federal Home Loan Bank Board seizedLincoln, Senator Cranston placed a 10 p.m. call to the homeof board member Roger Martin to urge the board to allow anunlikely looking last-minute sale of Lincoln. The nextmorning, at 6:30 a.m., Senator DeConcini called Mr. Martin tosay how important it was to his Arizona constituents to allowa sale of the California Sandamp;L.   This is &quot;constituent service,&quot; the Senators argued, andall Senators do it. We have a fair degree of tolerance forwatching sausages and laws being made, but somewhere in thismorass a line has to be drawn. If Mr. Keating got onlyconstituent service, then constituent service has to go. en</TEXT></DOC>
