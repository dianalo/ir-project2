The advertisement for the drug Antivert, which is prescribed for dizziness, features a photograph of a Chicago ironworker perilously perched on the tip of an antenna atop a skyscraper. Above the photo is the headline, &quot;No time for vertigo.&quot; But in much smaller letters in the text of the ad is the warning that since the drug may cause drowsiness &quot;patients should be . . . cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery.&quot;    In a letter to the Food and Drug Administration, the Public Citizen Health Research Group in Washington, D.C., called the ad &quot;dangerous, false, and misleading,&quot; and warned that its use by skyscraper workers &quot;could result in death or injury to workers so treated.&quot;    Officials at the FDA and Pfizer were surprised by the Health Research Group charge, saying the ad isn't meant to be taken literally. Roger Sachs, Pfizer vice president for regulatory affairs, said the ad isn't meant to &quot;imply that the drug is safe for these kinds of workers. It's just a good graphic representation of dizziness.&quot; He noted that drug, known generically as meclizine and sold by Pfizer's Roerig unit, has been on the market for more than 30 years and that the ad has been used since 1979.    A spokeswoman at the FDA said top officials hadn't seen the Health Research Group letter, but that agency staffers familiar with the ad considered it an &quot;attention-getter&quot; for doctors rather than an &quot;actual depiction of the drug's use.&quot;    Lynn Silver, a Health Research Group staffer, said the withdrawal request was made out of a &quot;sincere concern for people's health and safety.&quot; Dr. Silver said the criticism was part of an effort to get the FDA to monitor drug ads to doctors more closely.    Last fall, the group, which often targets the drug industry for sharp criticism, attacked a similar ad that suggested air-traffic controllers could ease on-the-job stress by taking a tranquilizer, Buspar, made by a Bristol-Myers Co. subsidiary. The ad was attacked by officials at the Federal Aviation Administration, which prohibits use of tranquilizers by controllers. Bristol-Myers said the depiction of air traffic controllers in the ad wasn't to be taken literally, but in light of the flap, the company pulled the ad. </TEXT></DOC>
