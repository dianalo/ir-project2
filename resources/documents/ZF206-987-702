 Thenation's manufacturers still remain component assembly plants,rather than legitimate manufacturers.andP;  In most cases, componentsare imported from Hong Kong and then assembled for the Chinesemarket.andP;  Microcomputers cost the equivalent of about $10,000 inChina, far out of the reach of most of the population.andP;  Thecountry's state-owned manufacturing outlets, however, are facing aripple of competition from a limited number of permitted privateentrepreneurial organizations.andP;  One example of this enterprise isthe Stone Company, a private seller of electronics whose salesexceed $300 million.andP;  The company, however, faces new challengesfrom the government that is concerned by the competition.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     ChinaMicrocomputersMarket AnalysisInternational TradeManufacturingAutomationForeign CompetitionGovernment Regulation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The China SyndromeandM;Despite its well-publicized modernization program, the People's Republic ofChina faces a long, difficult struggle before it can make and use PCseffectively.andM;China proudly claims to have built more than 32,000 PCs in 1985 alone.andP;  ButDenis Fred Simon, a professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy atTufts University, near Boston, says Chinese sources privately admit that,even as all those PCs were being manufactured, &quot;there were still 40,000stocked in warehouses with no customers in sight.&quot;andP;  China has not yet workedout the distribution, software, and user training issues necessary to makePCs work.andP;  This poor planning--common in the Chinese economy--has improvedonly modestly since then, and Chinese officials estimate that only 20 to 25percent of China's microcomputers are properly used.andM;Even if they can't use them, the Chinese are busy making them.andP;  Officialstatistics show that 67 percent of the microcomputers used in its domesticmarket in 1987 were made in China, up from just 36 percent in 1981.andP;  Thegovernment's stated goal is 80 percent self-sufficiency by 1990.andM;But these statistics imply a sophistication that doesn't really exist.andO;Except in foreign-owned enterprises, China still lacks the ability to makemany critical microcomputer components.andP;  It's not surprising that one scholarnotes rumors that some Chinese computers are essentially made in Hong Kongand only assembled in Beijing.andM;Legitimately imported PCs also come into China via this route.andP;  AST Research,the Irvine, California-based computer and add-on maker founded by two Chineseand one Southeast Asian immigrant, has created what AST internationalmarketing director Dan Dahl calls a &quot;healthy business&quot; selling PCs built inHong Kong and Taiwan to leading ministries in China.andP;  And experts on theChinese electronics industry point out that China imports most of itsmonitors from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and South Korea and gets most of itsprinters from Japan.andM;China's skimpy infrastructure and the demands of its socialist traditionclash mightily with the needs of modern technology, making foreign computerpurchases a continuing necessity.andP;  The personal computer revolution isadvancing only fitfully on the mainland, even as the capitalist Chineseenclaves of Hong Kong and Taiwan plunge headlong into the world of PCs.andO;There is a stirring within mainland China to emulate that success, but PCsremain a small part of the Chinese picture.andM;A State-RunandM;SystemandM;The mainland Chinese PC industry consists of dozens of state-run enterprisesproducing small computers, mostly PC clones.andP;  China's Ministry ofMachine-Building and Electronics Industry has organized enterprise groups inBeijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Guangzhou to make PCs and components.andP;  Butthe components for many of the computers produced by these groups are stillmade in Hong Kong and only assembled in China.andM;Two government-made machines--the Great Wall 0520 series, an IBM compatibleproduced in Beijing, and the Donghai 0520 series, a similar machine made inShanghai--have achieved fairly widespread use.andP;  In addition, the Chinesegovernment has enticed foreign enterprises to manufacture high-tech goods inChina using Chinese employees.andP;  And it is possible to buy a true-blue IBMPC-XT at a legitimate computer store in Beijing.andM;Chinese in Beijing use PCs in hotels, travel agencies, and researchinstitutions.andP;  But since a typical PC system (XT or AT compatible) costs some30,000 yuan ($10,000 at official exchange rates), computers remain rare in anation where the per capita yearly income is only about 1,000 yuan.andM;Software is also a problem.andP;  &quot;Traditionally, software has always beenneglected in socialist countries,&quot; explains Richard P. Suttmeier, professorof government at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York.andP;  &quot;It's easier for asocialist organization to point to the production of a machine than tosomething more elusive like software.&quot;andM;Despite the lack of homegrown alternatives, China buys relatively littleforeign software.andP;  The fairly small installed base of international-standardmachines, the country's ppor protection for intellectual property, and thedifficulty of supporting Chinese-language characters make the market lessthan attractive for foreign suppliers.andM;A Private AlternativeandM;The best hope for PCs in China may lie not with state-run enterprises butwith minban gongsi--literally, &quot;people's companies,&quot; private enterprises thatthe state has allowed individuals to create over the past decade.andP;  On SiliconStreet (Zhong Guan Cun) in Beijing, for example, dozens of tiny shops andstreet vendors sell electronic components primarily to technically mindedemployees of state enterprises who hope to assemble systems for theirorganizations.andM;The most successful of the electronics minban gongsi is the Si TongCorporation, known in the West as the Stone Corporation.andP;  Stone opened itsdoors in 1984 when a handful of young engineers left the Chinese Academy ofSciences and wangled a deal with Japan's Mitsui Corporation to import a24-pin Brother printer.andP;  Stone added its own ROM chip to the printer tohandle Chinese characters more efficiently.andM;Somehow, Stone found the foreign exchange needed to buy the printers fromMitsui.andP;  After adding the special chip, it was able to sell them in China forat least three times the original $500 price.andP;  Later, Stone created aChinese-character memory typewriter.andP;  Today, the company has emerged asChina's leading private technology enterprise, grossing more than $300million a year.andP;  Even government officials often mention Stone as a model forChina's economic future.andM;Stone is now working on a personal computer.andP;  It has established affiliatedcompanies to market computer-aided design equipment, computer networks, andcomputerized typesetting equipment, as well as industrial controls,scientific instruments, and power supplies.andM;Still, Stone's hardware is mostly made in Japan.andP;  In a factory outsideBeijing, Stone replicates its ROM chips and installs the latest version inthe imported hardware.andP;  Suttmeier, who visited Stone's factory a year ago,notes that it is &quot;very clean and very well managed as a private company.andO;Unlike other Chinese factories, you don't see piles of junk all over theplace.&quot;andM;Service with a SmileandM;Unlike government-owned companies, Stone maintains a broad service networkfor its products, with affiliated technicians in major cities.andP;  State-runenterprises often neglect support to focus on manufacturing components thatthey could import for one-tenth the cost.andP;  &quot;Traditionally, the socialistenterprise couldn't care less&quot; about service, says Suttmeier.andP;  &quot;They justmake the machine and deliver it to you.andP;  It's up to you to use it.&quot;andM;Stone and other companies like it seem to be the future of the Chinese PCindustry.andP;  Li Yuzhuo, a computer engineer who quit the Chinese Academy ofSciences, his country's most prestigious research institution, to join Stone,says the company's entrepreneurship represents China's best hope to create amodern economy.andP;  &quot;I once thought that if all Chinese worked as hard and asefficiently as the Japanese, China would have a hopeful future,&quot; Li told theofficial English-language newspaper, China Daily, a few months ago.andP;  &quot;Now Iwill say that if all Chinese worked the way Stone Corporation people work,China stands a chance.&quot;andM;Stone founder Wan Runnan, also a former employee of the Chinese Academy ofSciences, attributes his company's success to its &quot;demolition of the ironrice bowl system.&quot;andP;  The Chinese people believe that state companies willprovide their daily rice with utter dependability, as shatterproof as an ironrice bowl, Wan says.andP;  Socialist enterprises never go bankrupt or fire anyone.andO;Thus employees need not work hard.andM;A Mud Rice BowlandM;In contrast, Wan says, Stone offers a &quot;mud rice bowl.&quot;andP;  He explains, &quot;A mudrice bowl is easily broken, so the workers have to take good care of it.&quot;andO;Instead of lifetime employment, Stone offers workers one-year contracts;people &quot;work under pressure but with efficiency,&quot; says Wan.andM;Such is not the case for the average Chinese worker, and the Chinesegovernment is making little effort to change the situation.andP;  Stone's successhas already caused considerable resentment within China.andP;  Its &quot;high&quot; wages(the equivalent of up to $200 a month) have disrupted management at state-runenterprises, which often pay as little as one-fifth that amount.andM;Miao Yunpu, director of the Beijing Xinhua Printing House, complained to aChina Daily reporter that Stone had hired away one of his best employees witha salary of 200 yuan ($60) a month.andP;  Miao could not match the offer: &quot;If Itried to offer him more than the other workers, then the other workers wouldcomplain.&quot;andM;Some Chinese say that foreign exchange controls are designed to preventexactly the kind of high-profit import business that Stone is running, andthey question why the government allocated scarce foreign exchange funds tothe company to import printers from Japan.andM;In general, minban gongsi and the profits they earn have been legal in Chinasince the early 1980s.andP;  But private companies still face difficulties.andP;  Stoneemployees may have a hard time finding housing, education, and medical carein a nation where these necessities are generally provided by the statethrough communes.andM;Many aspects of Stone's status remain uncertain, including whether it cancontinue to charge high prices for its products.andP;  China decontrolled mostprices in April 1988 and allowed the money supply to soar.andP;  The nation'smanufacturing output grew rapidly, but prices ballooned too--rising as muchas 50 percent in some areas and prompting bank runs as ordinary Chinesesought to buy durable goods before prices rose even further.andM;Last October, the Communist party cracked down, sharply cutting back oninvestment, freezing prices, and declaring that local authorities muststrictly follow the central government's policies.andP;  Communist party chiefZhao Ziyang declared that the party would address the Chinese people'scomplaints about &quot;price hikes, unfair distribution of wealth, and corruptionin party and government institutions.&quot;andM;It's not clear how the retrenchment will affect Stone.andP;  But Zhao made itobvious that the Party's next moves would be toward reasserting control, notencouraging further private innovations.andP;  That can only make it harder fornew Stones to sprout.andP;  The era when China will fully participate in worldtechnology now seems almost as far away as it did a decade ago.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
