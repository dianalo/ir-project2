Yesterday, he finally succeeded.    As the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. began its three-day auction of the assets of the failed bank, about 1,000 curio and curiosity seekers flocked to town for a big-time shopping spree. Thanks to Mr. Johnson's ambitions, they could pick from a cornucopia of fine art, extravagant furniture and crystal and brass accent pieces. &quot;We haven't done anything just like this before,&quot; marveled Mark C. Thomas, who has presided over some 50 bank auctions for the FDIC, the agency that has the job of liquidating the assets of federally insured banks that fail. &quot;The quantity of the quality is just amazing to us,&quot; he added.    When it closed June 4, the bank had $202.1 million in assets and $163.1 in deposits. There were no bidders for the bank itself, but another Austin bank acquired the insured deposits.    In a sense, this is more than just an auction, it is a requiem for Texas banking and its highflying style of doing business. This was the land of deal-on-a-handshake banking, where one banker routinely approved two deals at a time by clamping phones to both ears and another ruined so many tablecloths doodling loan deals that his favorite lunch place started covering his regular table with paper. Some Texas bankers drove Rolls-Royces, threw lavish parties and flew customers around in private jets and helicopters.    With a record 46 failures so far this year, that's all gone now -- at least until the next boom hits this state's ravaged economy. In the state's hard-hit farm communities and oil towns, bank auctions have become a regular part of the social calendar, the inevitable result of the oil bust, the real estate glut and the excesses of ambitious men like Ruben Johnson.    In 1981, Mr. Johnson moved this bank, which had been a fixture in its familiar storefront offices for many years, into a downtown Austin office tower. The new quarters featured a massive steel bank vault door that could be seen from the street and a helicopter pad on the roof. The bank's rent went from a pittance to about $100,000 a month; Mr. Johnson spent about $1.2 million just on the interior work, and almost as much to decorate it with the furniture he selected personally.    So what if the move was costly? Real estate was booming, oil prices were soaring and the sky was the limit. Mr. Johnson bet the bank's future on Texas real estate, joining the legion of optimistic lenders who saturated the area with construction projects. &quot;Everybody thought real estate was going to increase,&quot; says Robert Fry, the bank's vice chairman. &quot;Nobody was anticipating what the market was going to do.&quot;    Mr. Johnson leaped into big-time lending with unbridled zeal. He entertained state politicians, courted their business and introduced them to celebrities like opera singer Beverly Sills. While larger banks were seeking the security of wellheeled bank holding companies, Mr. Johnson guarded United Bank's independence. His real estate venture ballooned the bank's assets nearly ninefold in just three years. &quot;Deals just came in off the street,&quot; Mr. Fry recalls.    But the market collapsed from its own weight and Austin was hit especially hard. Among major Texas cities, Austin has perhaps the weakest real estate market currently, and the outlook for a quick recovery is bleak.    On all too many projects, United Bank was a secondary lender, meaning it had less collateral than the lead bank when the project went belly up. The bank was forced to close on $6 million worth of Austin condominiums. The FDIC cracked down on its loose lending practices, pushing the bank to raise capital in a rescue effort. The stunning growth was ended and the bank was left with mounting loan losses. Last June, it failed, leaving behind a legacy of excess -- in optimism and in spending.    At a rodeo ring on the outskirts of town, with a Rolls-Royce and other fancy cars parked alongside rented trucks, the rich trappings of Mr. Johnson's business lifestyle are being parceled out for nickels on the dollar. Among the offerings: a table full of delicate, gold and silver figurines of dragons and a large stagecoach. The auctioneers considered these so valuable that a guard hovered over them. Also, 165 executive and secretarial desks, many of mahogany and topped with leather, 450 plush chairs, about 200 vases of crystal, brass or porcelain, 162 custom-made brass and crystal chandeliers and enough Irish linens, 19th century lithographs and leather-bound literary classics to attract big-time art and book dealers from around the country.    Some Texas bankers came, seeking to acquire Mr. Johnson's decor at a fraction of the cost. &quot;It's just furniture for sale,&quot; says Joe R. Long, chairman of First State Bank of Austin, which is moving into United Bank's posh quarters.    Robert H. Sewell, chairman of Equitable Bankshares Inc., a small, Dallas-based bank holding company, was astonished at the opulence. &quot;I don't look at it as bank furniture,&quot; he says. &quot;Bankers don't have this kind of stuff.&quot; Nevertheless, he arrived with $100,000 in cashier's checks, enough, he figures, to outfit half of two new branches. Usually, he calculates, he would spend $350,000 to buy that much furniture and equipment. He also was in the market for automated teller machines and other banking equipment.    Peggy Bird, an Austin housewife, picked through the fine China dishware on the block. Some of the plates once adorned the private dining room where United Bank officers entertained customers.    Joe K. Longley had his eye on a 30-foot boardroom table. He had coveted the item since he first pulled a chair up to it at United Bank's offices. Never mind that none of the rooms in the lawyer's offices is big enough to accommodate the massive table. &quot;I'll cut it up,&quot; he says. &quot;It has great sentimental value to me.&quot;    But Mr. Longley was frustrated in his efforts yesterday. The table was withheld from the auction; the bank's landlord claims ownership as payment for back rent.    Among those who missed the auction's start was Mr. Johnson, who resigned from the bank almost two years ago. He was seen earlier this week, however, rummaging through the auction site, looking at what was left of United Bank. </TEXT></DOC>
