The debate over the amendment on November's ballot intensifiedafter James Edward Pough, 42, a day laborer, killed eight peopleMonday with a semiautomatic rifle before taking his own life with arevolver at an auto loan agency. Police said Pough also killed twopeople on the street Sunday with the rifle.   ``How many messages do we send to the Congress? How many to thestate Legislature?'' Jacksonville Mayor Tommy Hazouri said Tuesday.``If it means seeking changes ... we're going to do that.''   State Rep. Ron Silver, chairman of the House Criminal JusticeCommittee, said the fact the waiting period is being settled by areferendum rather than a vote in the Legislature shows manylawmakers still fear the NRA's clout.   But he added that polls indicate heavy support for theamendment, and he said passage could give legislators confidence topass other gun-control laws.   ``I think Florida is waking up,'' Silver said.   California passed an assault weapons bill in 1989 in theaftermath of the Stockton, Calif., schoolyard spree by a drifterwith an AK-47 assault rifle who killed five children and wounded 30other people. President Bush approved an import ban on assaultweapons and a Senate bill would extend the ban to domesticmanufacture of four weapons identified as used mainly in drugviolence.   Florida has tackled gun legislation several times in recentyears.   A 1987 law removed gun registration from county control in favorof statewide registration rules. A law taking effect Oct. 1requires gun sellers to check all applicants through a crimecomputer in Tallahassee.   But lawmakers on a study commission on assault weapons failed toagree on which weapons should be banned.   U.S. Rep. Bill Nelson, a Democrat running for governor, hascalled banning assault weapons a priority.   ``It is harder to rent a car in Florida than it is to buy anAK-47,'' he said during a debate Monday before he knew of theshooting spree. A Nelson aide needed less than 10 minutes to walkinto a Miami gun shop and come out with an AK-47 and ammunitionlast month.   Gov. Bob Martinez, a Republican seeking re-election, saidTuesday the law requiring a background check by gun dealers is aresponsible step, ``but at the same time we must maintain thefreedom to own guns which have useful sporting purposes.''   Pough's .30-caliber semiautomatic rifle would be banned underNew Jersey's month-old law on assault weapons, considered thenation's toughest, because its clip held more than 15 rounds.   Nelson wants a seven-day waiting period on handgun purchases.Democratic front-runner Lawton Chiles also supports a waitingperiod.   Now, gun purchasers are required to have some identification,such as a driver's license, and fill out a questionnaire onarrests, mental illness and drug use.   But there is no way for merchants to confirm the informationother than by investigating on their own.   It is illegal in Florida for a convicted felon to own a handgun.But technically, Pough wasn't a convicted felon.   In 1971, he was charged with manslaughter in the shooting deathof a man; he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was sentencedto five years' probation, court records show. After probation, hisrecord was wiped clean.   That made it legal for Pough to own a gun under Florida law.   ``It's a loophole we need to plug up,'' Jacksonville Sheriff JimMcMillan said.</TEXT></DOC>
