Attentionwas focused on taking during the closed season provided by the 1918 MigratoryBird Treaty Act (Treaty Act). The public comment period on the proposalclosed on March 31, 1988. The Service received approximately 100 writtencomments and held numerous meetings with subsistence users and conservationgroups throughout the state. After carefully considering public response, the Service has adopted afinal policy. The policy is a statement about the priorities the Servicewill follow in Alaska to protect waterfowl during the closed season. Itconcentrates enforcement efforts on violations that have the most seriousimpacts on the resource and focuses special attention on the protectionof four diminished populations of geese: Cackling Canada geese, emperorgeese, Pacific white-fronted geese, and black brant. It also seeks to preventthe use of private and charter aircraft to assist in hunting. As a secondlevel of priority, the policy gives attention to protecting other speciesof waterfowl during nesting, brood-rearing, and flightless periods. Thepolicy states that limited harvest of migratory birds for food in unforeseenemergency situations will not be prosecuted. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>dates: </T2>The Service's policy in Alaska for enforcement of the closedseason under the Treaty Act became effective on April 22, 1988.

The notice also terminated aproposed rulemaking announced to the public on May 19, 1986, (51 FR 18349)to permit and regulate subsistence hunting for migratory birds in Alaska.The rulemaking was halted by an October 9, 1987, opinion from the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that any regulations for subsistencehunting promulgated pursuant to the 1978 Fish and Wildlife ImprovementAct must be in accordance with the 1916 Convention between the United Statesand Great Britain (for Canada) for the Protection of Migratory Birds (CanadianTreaty) implemented by the Treaty Act. The Canadian Treaty specificallyprohibits hunting for most migratory birds between March 10 and September1. Finally, the notice indicated Service support for continuation of aYukon-Kuskokwim Delta Goose Management Plan, a cooperative management agreementfor the conservation of geese that nest primarily in western Alaska. The December 31, 1987, notice stated that comments on the proposed policyshould be received on or before February 29, 1988. Many requests were receivedto extend the comment period. Both written and verbal comments indicateda lack of understanding by much of the general public of the reasons forthe policy and the manner in which it would be implemented. The commentperiod therefore was extended to March 31, 1988 (53 FR 6853). The Serviceused the extended comment period to provide additional information on theproposed policy and to obtain additional comments from the public, particularlyfrom those residents of rural Alaska who will be most affected by the policy.Issuance by the Service of a law enforcement policy is not subject to thenormal notice and comment procedures of the Administrative Procedures Act.However, the legal status of subsistence hunting in Alaska has for fouryears been the subject of litigation that has been confusing to the public.In light of this, and because of the great interest in the issue and needfor understanding of the policy throughout the state, the Service believedthat it would be beneficial in this instance to provide for public reviewof the proposed policy. Comments received are evaluated below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Review of Public Comments </ITAG>During the public comment period, the Service conducted over 50 meetingswith subsistence users and conservation organizations throughout Alaska.Most of these meetings were in rural communities. Service personnel alsoparticipated in several radio and television interview programs on theproposed policy and newspaper coverage of the issue was widespread. Approximately100 written comments were received, about 80 of which originated from withinAlaska. Following are summaries of major areas of concern identified bythe public and Service responses to those concerns. 1. <T3>Statewide application of the policy to all waterfowl. </T3>A numberof comments concerned the broad application of the policy statewide, includingwaterfowl (ducks, geese, and swans) other than the four species of Arcticnesting geese covered by the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta Goose Management Plan.``Statewide policy * * * should be focused on specific bird populationswhere biological problems can be documented (e.g., Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta),hunting incidents which are abusive or blatant deviations from normal huntingpractices in an area, and cases where large, wasteful harvests are found.''``* * * the Service must recognize that in regions other than the Yukon-KuskokwimDelta, subsistence hunters do not perceive any decline in the availabilityof waterfowl resources.'' There were, however, some comments that the emphasis of the proposed policyon the four Arctic nesting geese with identified population declines couldlead to overlooking problems with other waterfowl. ``We are concerned thatemphasis on geese may imply that other regulations will be disregardedwhen a comprehensive policy on migratory bird hunting for all of Alaskais needed. The policy should be carefully redrafted to make this clear.''<T3>Response. </T3>The final policy applies throughout Alaska and retainsa provision that gives attention to the protection of waterfowl in generalduring the nesting, brood-rearing, and flightless periods. The Servicebelieves that this is necessary for responsible management not only oflow populations of geese, but of other waterfowl during the most vulnerableperiod of their life cycle. This emphasizes preventative maintenance sothat other populations will not decline like the four species of Arcticnesting geese. The policy is clear that primary law enforcement emphasiswill be directed toward the four species of geese, and will only secondarilybe directed toward waterfowl in general. 2. <T3>Policy lacks clear definitions on levels of enforcement and emergencysituations. </T3>There were many comments stating that the proposed enforcementpolicy was ambiguous, particularly in regard to the anticipated level andtype of enforcement and emergency situations. ``The policy document shouldcontain a realistic description of the general level of enforcement thatis intended in different areas of the state.'' ``The FWS enforcement policyshould also be more specific about the measures it proposes to use.'' ``Wewould like for the Service to clearly spell out what `emergency food' means.''``Does the FWS policy mean that all the Hostess twinkies and wheat thinsand canned milk have to empty before villagers can legally go out and hunt?''<T3>Response. </T3>The Service intends to place its primary focus on protectionof the four diminished populations of geese. On the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta,attention will be directed to seeking compliance with the management principlesidentified in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta Goose Management Plan. In areasoutside the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, the Service also will devote its effortsto protecting the four species of geese and to identifying other speciesand circumstances where additional protection is needed. In 1988, the focusof Service activities in regard to the policy will be on providing informationto affected parties, not on mounting a greatly expanded enforcement effort.Regarding ``emergency situations,'' it is the Service's intent that thisprovision equate to the provision in Alaska's game regulations allowingan individual to take game for food during the closed season in case of``dire emergency.'' It is not intended to apply broadly to entire communitiesor regions. 3. <T3>Increased educational efforts, community involvement, and cooperativemanagement. </T3>The need for more community involvement in managementactivities was stressed in a large number of comments on the proposed policy.Several people expressed the need for an increased educational program.``We encourage the Service to do all it can to educate the Alaskan Nativesabout the deleterious effects of harvesting the `principal,' rather thanthe `interest,' that can occur when the taking occurs in the spring.''``Go to the village; tell the people what you are trying to accomplish.''Other comments expressed a need for development of cooperative managementplans. It was felt that such plans would result in a more coordinated effortto rectify resource management concerns. The Alaska Federation of Natives``strongly recommends that a cooperative management agreement between FWSand the Native community or communities in a regional geographic area precede* * * developing an enforcement policy. Native egg-gatherers and huntershave a strong interest in ensuring the long-term conservation of migratorywaterfowl.'' ``Without such a cooperative effort, it will be difficultto gain cooperation in efforts to enhance populations of identified species.''<T3>Response.</T3> The Service concurs that there is a need for expandedinformational efforts in rural Alaska regarding the status and managementof waterfowl populations in general and of diminished populations of geesein particular. The Service has expanded its educational program both onand outside of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and will continue to stress communicationand information in the future to achieve compliance with the policy. TheService continues to view the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta Goose Management Planas an essential element in the conservation of the four geese. Similarcooperative efforts may be of benefit in other areas and circumstances.The Service does not believe that all such efforts need to result in formal,written agreements, but agrees that improved communications and commonunderstanding are necessary for management of waterfowl resources in amanner that is supported by local rural residents.4. <T3>Ban on use of charter or private aircraft for hunting migratory birds.</T3>Several comments were received relative to this provision of the proposedpolicy. Most of these comments supported the ban and, in several instances,recommended placing additional restrictions on aircraft and other methodsof transportation. ``The Kwethluk IRA is very much opposed to use of charteredor private aircraft for the purpose of hunting, shipping or transportationof illegally caught migratory birds.'' ``Using aircraft and ATVs to harvestin the closed season should be strictly prohibited.'' ``Add a sentencewhich will make it clear that this policy does not apply to regular commercialflights to and from villages.''Two letters specifically opposed the ban on aircraft use. ``Your proposalto prohibit the use of private or charter aircraft for purposes of huntingor transporting migratory birds during the closed season is perplexing.I am not aware of any particular abuse of spring and summer hunting withaircraft.'' ``If the FWS wants to limit or restrict aircraft use, it shouldnot use a `subsistence' argument.''<T3>Response.</T3> Preventing use of private or charter aircraft for purposesof hunting migratory birds during the closed season is retained as a provisionof the final policy. The Service does not believe that use of such aircraftconstitutes a legitimate mode of access for subsistence hunting. Aircraftare known to be used for closed season hunting by residents of some urbanareas and large regional service communities where sources of food areplentiful. In addition, use of aircraft in spring provides access to huntingareas that otherwise would be left undisturbed. The enforcement emphasison preventing use of aircraft does not apply to the use of commercial flightsthat rural residents now use routinely to travel to and from their villages.5. <T3>Full enforcement of Migratory Bird Treaty Act closed season. </T3>Severalcomments stated that the Service should strictly enforce the closed seasonprovisions of the Treaty Act, allowing no hunting during the closed season.One group stated that it ``is unconditionally opposed to all hunting (and/ortrapping) of all species of migratory birds, or the taking of their eggs,during spring and summer.'' ``To be complete, the policy must state clearlythat the taking of migratory birds in Alaska during the period March 10to September 1 is unlawful, and that customary and traditional uses ofmigratory birds during that period will not, without more, constitute an`unforeseen emergency situation.' ''<T3>Response.</T3> With very limited exceptions, the hunting of migratorybirds between March 10 and September 1 is illegal. However, the Servicehas discretion to apply the law in a reasonable way in consideration ofresource needs and priorities. It is not required to act in a strict orinflexible manner. It is the Service's intent to provide protection tomigratory birds by directing attention to the highest priority needs forprotection. Under the Canadian Treaty, Indians can take scoters at anytime for food and Eskimos and Indians can take auks, auklets, guillemots,murres, puffins, and their eggs at any time for food and clothing. In addition,federal regulations permit any person in Alaska to take snowy owls andcormorants at any time for food and clothing.6. <T3>Inadequate public involvement in developing the policy.</T3> One ofthe most commonly expressed concerns about the proposed enforcement policywas the perceived lack of public involvement in the formulation of thepolicy and concerns about the notification process involved in solicitingcomments on it. Examples of comments include: ``In its headlong rush topromulgate the proposed policy by this spring, the Service has woefullyneglected to work with the Native community.'' ``It was only by accidentthat I heard a radio blurb in early February regarding this policy publication.''``Many of our elders, not only from Toksook Bay, have made their concernsand comments before and none of them was incorporated into the plan.''<T3>Response.</T3> These comments reflect some of the early reaction tothe proposed policy based on limited information and a fear that the initialFebruary 29, 1988, closure of the public comment period would not allowadequate presentation of concerns. Subsequent to extending the commentperiod to March 31, 1988, the Service conducted numerous public meetingswhich appeared to greatly ameliorate this situation. The Service's mailinglist for notices and information relating to development of the policyincludes over 900 addresses, including three governmental and Native corporateentities in most villages in Alaska.7. <T3>Lack of data.</T3> A number of respondents expressed concern aboutdevelopment of a closed season enforcement policy without adequate informationon past and present levels of subsistence waterfowl hunting, regional differencesin the relative health of specific waterfowl populations, and the effectsof subsistence hunting on these populations. ``We felt that there shouldbe biological studies on numerical numbers and usage state-wide.'' ``Tobe consistent with our understanding of ANILCA, the FWS should first collectdetailed biological data as a basis for decisions.''<T3>Response.</T3> The Service agrees with the need for improved informationon the status and harvest of waterfowl populations throughout Alaska, butdoes not believe that lack of such data should preclude application ofthe policy on a statewide basis. Excellent data exist for some speciesand some areas. The Service will continue to obtain information neededfor management of other species and other areas as funding and prioritiesallow.8. <T3>Impacts of the proposed policy on ``traditional lifestyles.'' </T3>Numerouscomments were made related to the impact of the proposed closed seasonenforcement policy on the lives of rural residents. These comments wereusually pointed to one of three areas: The cultural significance of springand summer hunting and egg-gathering, the nutritional significance of theseactivities, or the economic impacts of curtailing such activities. ``Waterfowlharvest has been an important nutritional and cultural resource to theYup'ik people and other Alaska Native cultures for thousands of years.''``Rural areas, and especially the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, have some of thelowest incomes in the state, and rely on subsistence-caught fish, game,marine mammals, and birds for a large part of their protein needs.'' Migratorybirds provide an important food source for local residents throughout theentire March to September closed season, but especially during the springmonths.''<T3>Response.</T3> The Service has recognized for many years that residentsof certain remote areas in Alaska depend on waterfowl as an important sourceof food, especially in spring and early summer. Because of this, prohibitionson taking during the closed season generally have not been strictly enforcedprovided that the birds were taken in a non-wasteful manner and were usedas food. Although the Service cannot legally permit the hunting of migratorybirds during the closed season even for subsistence, the policy stressesprotection of four populations of geese as a first priority and addressesthe taking of other waterfowl as a second level priority during the nesting,brood rearing, and flightless periods. The Service does not believe thatthis will result in dramatic changes to traditional lifestyles in ruralAlaska.9. <T3>Protocol to the United States/Canada migratory bird treaty. </T3>Anumber of respondents identified the need to proceed with a protocol toamend the Canadian Treaty to allow for subsistence taking of waterfowlduring the closed season. ``A protocol amendment to the Canadian treatyto acknowledge Alaska Native traditional use of migratory birds is needed.''``Why no mention of the intent to amend the restrictive Canadian Treatyto agree with later treaties with USSR, Japan, and Mexico, to show thatthe US is trying to correct its mistake?''<T3>Response.</T3> The Service supports a protocol amendment to the CanadianTreaty that contains provisions for subsistence hunting similar to thosein the migratory bird treaty with the Soviet Union and the 1978 Fish andWildlife Improvement Act. A protocol was signed in January 1979 but hasnot been ratified in the United States because of concerns raised aboutits effects. The Service began work with the Canadian Wildlife Servicein 1983 to develop a joint United States/Canada agreement that would explainhow each country would interpret and implement the protocol. A draft agreementhas been developed but has not yet been approved by Canadian officials.10. <T3>Impacts to waterfowl populations not related to subsistence harvest.</T3>Several letters identified factors other than subsistence harvestwhich are affecting the populations of migratory waterfowl, including sporthunting, loss of wintering habitat, and predation. These comments oftensuggested that the Service was doing little to evaluate the impact of theseactivities on bird populations and that control of these factors shouldbe considered prior to (or in conjunction with) enforcement of the closedseason in areas of subsistence harvest. ``Other elements of this programsuch as habitat management and protection, predator control and managementof sport harvest must also be considered. This cannot be limited to thebreeding grounds and will require a comprehensive year-round plan for managementof affected species.'' ``One positive action you can do is raise the whitefox pelts and lower the gulls population. Kill them off. The second isthe growing number of farms which is robbing these birds of their foodand resting grounds.''<T3>Response.</T3> The Service has for years been aware of factors otherthan subsistence harvest that affect populations of waterfowl throughouttheir ranges. Preservation and enhancement of habitat and control of sporthunting are major activities of the Service both in Alaska and in winteringareas. Study and control of contaminants and diseases receive particularattention in wintering areas. Comprehensive plans currently being developedfor the four species of geese are scheduled for completion by December1988. The effect of predation on geese is being actively studied on theYukon-Kuskokwim Delta. This includes evaluation of experimental fox controlprograms on nesting success and production. The current effort to addresssubsistence harvest in Alaska is not occurring in isolation, but is partof an overall program to restore diminished populations of geese and tohelp prevent declines in other populations of waterfowl that nest in andmigrate through the state.11. <T3>Nesting sanctuaries.</T3> Several respondents identified the need toestablish nesting sanctuaries in order to fully protect migratory birds.``We have continually advocated the identification of `inviolate sanctuaries'carefully located to protect core populations of the four species of geeseinvolved where violations of trespass by anyone during the critical nesting,resting, and molting period would be strictly enforced.''<T3>Response.</T3> The Service will begin discussions soon with local residentsnear selected goose nesting areas on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta to maximizeproduction within zones established to minimize disturbance to geese. Thesezones could include any combination of elements such as experimental predatorcontrol, limited human access, and no harvest. The Service also is consideringthe reestablishment of geese on underutilized nesting habitats. Many ofthe potentially best management areas are private lands owned in wholeor in part by Native village corporations. Establishment of the managementareas generally will require cooperative agreements with local residentsto assure the highest degree of compliance possible with the Yukon-KuskokwimDelta Goose Management Plan. The Service does not believe that unilateralestablishment of sanctuaries is feasible.<ITAG tagnum="84">Need for Policy and Relation to Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta Goose ManagementPlan </ITAG>The Treaty Act prohibits the taking of migratory birds except as permittedby regulations published by the Service. The Treaty Act further requiresthat the regulations must be consistent with the provision of the 1916Canadian Treaty. Accordingly, the Service publishes regulations annuallythat establish open seasons and bag limits for migratory game birds withinthe September 1 to March 10 period provided by that treaty. Except in Alaska,the Service has always strictly enforced the prohibitions against takingmigratory birds during closed seasons; that is, during those times of yearoutside the hunting seasons established in the annual hunting regulations.The Service has recognized for many years that residents of certain ruralareas in Alaska depend on waterfowl and some other migratory birds as customaryand traditional sources of food, primarily in spring and early summer.Because of this long established dependence, the Service generally hasexercised its discretion to not strictly enforce the closed season in theseareas provided that any birds taken are taken in a non-wasteful mannerand are used for food. Historically, the taking of waterfowl and other migratory birds for subsistencepurposes in Alaska does not appear to have had a significant adverse impacton the populations from which the birds were taken. In recent years, however,the levels of taking in Alaska and elsewhere, in combination with otherfactors such as nest predation by foxes, have caused drastic declines insome populations of birds. This has been particularly apparent in populationsof four species of geese that nest primarily on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta:Cackling Canada Geese, emperor geese, Pacific white-fronted, geese, andblack brant. Since 1984, efforts to halt declines of the four populations of geese havebeen undertaken pursuant to a Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta Goose Management Planrenewed annually. The Service has viewed the plan as an effective mechanismin providing a basis for cooperative management of geese on the Yukon-KuskokwimDelta and elsewhere. This cooperative management includes provisions toreduce sport harvest of these species and to reduce or minimize subsistenceharvest that is not in accordance with the Treaty Act. In the future, theService intends to enforce the Treaty Act with respect to closed seasonsubsistence hunting in accordance with the enforcement policy describedbelow. On the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, the Service's enforcement policy willbe supported by a revised goose management plan. The annual renewal ofthe plan is an essential element in the conservation of the geese on theirnesting grounds. It retains an established mechanism for communicationwith the subsistence hunters most affected by the policy and will encouragethe cooperation needed to achieve population objectives incorporated intoprevious plans. The Service recognizes that among subsistence users there is a wide rangein the level of understanding of the impacts of spring and summer harvestof waterfowl and the need to reduce mortality, especially when populationsbecome depressed. The Service will continue educational efforts to expandthe understanding of this problem and will consider this factor in carryingout enforcement efforts on a statewide basis. <ITAG tagnum="84">Closed Season Enforcement Policy in Alaska </ITAG>Service enforcement efforts in Alaska during the closed season will beconcentrated on violations that have the most serious impact on the resource.Special attention will be given to the protection of cackling Canada geese,emperor geese, Pacific white-fronted geese, and black brant. These specieshave suffered severe population declines in recent years and need specialprotection. In order to protect these geese, priority will be given toenforcement designed to support the following principles: <ITAG tagnum="15">_No taking of cackling Canada or emperor geese at any time; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_No taking of Pacific white-fronted geese or black brant during thenesting, brood-rearing, and flightless periods; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_No taking the eggs of any of the above four species of geese; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_No use of charter or private aircraft to assist in hunting. </ITAG>As a second level of priority, the Service also will give attention toprotecting other species of waterfowl from taking during nesting, brood-rearing,and flightless periods, including the taking of their eggs. Identificationof circumstances warranting additional protection for migratory birds duringthe closed season will be based on the status of populations and will involveconsultation with affected interests. Of greatest concern will be situationsinvolving waste or harvest exceeding reasonable levels of need under existingcircumstances. The Service recognizes that unforeseen emergency situations can occur inrural Alaska where food is unavailable and no means of transportation orother opportunities exist to obtain food. Regardless of the prohibitionsoutlined above, the taking of migratory birds in such situations in limitednumbers to provide emergency food will not be referred to the United StatesAttorney for prosecution. <ITAG tagnum="21">Date: May 5, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Walter O.
