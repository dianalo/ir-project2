WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell toldgovernors concerned about the budget today that Congress and thepresident ``have got to summon the resolve'' to achieve significantreductions in the federal deficit this year.   Facing questioning about the nation's ``fiscal insanity'' at agathering of the nation's governors, Mitchell, D-Maine, said he hadjust left a meeting with President Bush where they ``reaffirmed thismorning our commitment to a cooperative effort on the budget'' andother areas.   ``The situation has reached a stage that is so critical _ theevents of recent weeks, increases in interest rates, threaten uswith being just consumed with interest payments on the debt _ thatwe've got to summon the resolve to do it,'' Mitchell said.   He addressed the final session of the National Governors'Association annual winter meeting, which heard from congressionalleaders and administration officials that they should expect nofinancial help from Washington because of the crisis posed by thefederal deficit.   Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus of Idaho said ``the fiscal insanitythat presently prevails over this city'' is the over-riding problemfacing each of the governors. He asked Mitchell what Congress woulddo.   The Senate leader responded that he believed Congress has thewill to act on the deficit but cannot act without the president. Hesaid Bush has ``strongly held views in many areas'' _ an apparentreference to the president's flat opposition to tax increases.   Mitchell said the governors, like other Americans, holdconflicting views that complicate a budget answer.   ``You've got a number of policy statements here, governor, thatcall for increased federal spending ... and yet another one thatcalls for meaningful deficit reduction,'' he said, referring to thepolicy statements of the bipartisan governors' association.   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and Sen. Brock Adams,D-Wash., who held that job in the Carter administration, told thegovernors Monday to expect congressional deficit fighters to crowdout a traditional source of state revenues by attempting an increasein the federal tax on gasoline.   ``There is significant pressure in the House for such a gas taxfor deficit reduction'' as well as the Senate, Skinner said. ``Iwould not assume or take for granted it will not be successful.''   The federal government currently levies a 9 cents per gallon taxon gasoline, and it is often eyed as a source of more money. Adamssaid that for each penny it is raised, $1 billion in revenue iscollected.   But states levy taxes on fuel for their own transportationspending, and governors in both parties say any increase in thefederal tax makes it more difficult for the states to raise theirown gasoline taxes.   Gov. James Thompson, R-Ill., said the governors would ask for thefederal government to promise to turn some of the revenue over tothe states if the gas tax is increased for transportation needs. Hesaid he would oppose a gas tax increase for non-transportationpurposes.   The governors conducted their meeting, which began on Saturday,with few displays of partisanship as they sought to hear fromcongressional leaders and top officials of the Bush administrationon the outlook for the budget and what it means for the states.   The message they heard was generally simple: don't expect muchfinancial help from the federal government because of the budgetdeficit.   Senate Budget Committe Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., offeredthat message in a session on Sunday, and Skinner offered theadministration's version on Monday in reference to the governors'requests for more federal spending on highways, bridges and othertransportation needs.   ``I see no sentiment whatsoever for a salvation from Washingtonfor the infrastructure problems of this nation,'' Skinner said.   He said the governors should expect a greater share of the burdenfor transportation needs to shift to the states.   Governors have been seeking the release of more money from thefederal highway trust fund, and Gov. Henry Bellmon, R-Okla., said,``We'd like to have our slice of that trust fund _ the sooner thebetter.''   But Skinner said much of the money on hand is already obligatedfor future spending. ``There is not a potload of money ... that'sgoing to be available for the future,'' he said.   Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, D-Ore., like Adams a former transportationsecretary, said transportation needs warrant increased federalspending. ``There are really some infrastructure problems in thiscountry that are keeping us from being competitive,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
