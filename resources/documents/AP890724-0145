Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., wants all those requesting federalfunds to report the name of any lobbyists paid to help get thegovernment grant, contract, cooperative agreement loan, loanguarantee or loan insurance.   If any of the federal money is used to pay someone for personalinfluence, unrelated to the merits of the project, the grant orloan recipient would be fined $100,000.   ``Had this legislation been in place it would have been adeterrent in relation to things that happened at HUD,'' said Byrd.   His proposal was approved Monday by a Senate Appropriationssubcommittee as an amendment to the appropriations bill for theInterior Department and related agencies.   It still must be approved by the full committee, the full Senateand go through a conference committee including members of theHouse. It was not part of the House legislation.   ``This is not an anti-lobbying bill,'' said Byrd.   It doesn't prohibit payments ``to consultants for professionalor other technical services in connection with meetingrequirements'' for receiving the grants or loans, he said.   ``But when the consultant goes beyond that to get the contract''there will be trouble, said Byrd.   He spoke critically of information he had received aboutconsultants who are knowledgeable about government programs, designgrant proposals and then go shopping for a university or otherinstitution willing to apply for the money and pay them for theproposal.   Byrd said his plan would affect all government agencies.   He called the reporting aspect the best part of the plan.   ``It will alert people up and down the line,'' he said. ``Itestablishes a data base that can be analyzed.''   Twice a year, the federal agencies granting money would berequired to file with the secretary of the Senate and the clerk ofthe House complete lists of the lobbyists' names, addresses,amounts paid and the purposes for which they were paid.   The lists would be available to the public and will be examinedby the inspector general's office, Byrd said.</TEXT></DOC>
