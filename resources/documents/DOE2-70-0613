Approximately4600 tons of ore were processed each day at the mill to produce lead,copper and zinc concentrates. Several of the control measures in placeat the facility were state of the art including the use of isolated controlbooths for crushing, grinding, and flotation; good housekeeping programwith a removal of dust on roadways and dock areas; use of binders sprayedover the lead concentrate pile stored in the open to prevent air erosionand contamination and oxidation of the lead sulfide; use of a binder,vinyl latex emulsion, to cover zinc concentrate shipped on gondola car;use of a water spike to empty drums of cyanide and xanthate, and thelining of the truck bed hauling lead concentrates and other areas; useof an aspirator-type vacuum system in the reagent room for dumping bagsof starch to reduce dust; the use of wall insulation for temperatureand noise control; and the use of an enclosed conveyor system. The authorrecommends that this facility be made a part of the in-depth study ofhealth hazards at lead-ore-beneficiation facilities so that a more-detailedevaluation of the effectiveness of these control measures may be undertaken.</TEXT></DOC>
