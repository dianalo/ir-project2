Lon Perry, a 49-year-old unemployed oil-industry computertechnician, confessed to Houston authorities that hecommitted 99 hotel robberies in Texas, saying he committedthe crimes because of financial pressures. In a preparedstatement, Mr. Perry said he became suicidal after losing hisjob in late 1988 at Texas Eastern Corp. Throughout thetwo-year spree of robberies that followed, he said he wasracked with feelings of remorse.</LP><TEXT>   Houston police, holding Mr. Perry, of nearby Spring,Texas, on a $20,000 arrest bond, said they intended to filecharges late last night or today.   Mr. Perry's attorney, Allen C. Isbell of Houston, saidthat &quot;in return for clearing up all of the cases in Texas,Mr. Perry will plead guilty to a small number of cases andreceive a sentence of 35 years. He will be eligible forparole after serving a little more than eight years.&quot;   Mr. Isbell said he was negotiating to settle the Louisianacases as part of the same deal.   More than 100 robberies, starting in the summer of 1989and continuing until July of this year, took place at hotelsin about 15 cities in Texas and five in Louisiana. Therobber, a middle-aged man in a business suit, typicallyknocked on victims' doors and said he knew them fromsomewhere. He talked himself into their rooms beforeproducing a revolver and demanding their cash. Victims,mostly middle-aged businessmen, lost between $8 and $700. Thecrime spree was the subject of a Page One story in thisnewspaper.   Because of his courteous manner throughout the robberies,police dubbed the criminal the Gentleman Bandit. During onerobbery, he called the front desk and ordered an ambulancefor a victim complaining of chest pains.   In his statement, Mr. Perry said that to get out of thehouse to commit the robberies, he told his wife he had landeda job. He said he kept track of the names and addresses ofall his victims with the intention of repaying them someday.He also said the revolver used in the robberies couldn't befired.   He said he decided to confess to the crimes after policeon June 28 wrongly charged Michael David Harvey, a foodbroker from Cibolo, Texas, with two robberies. Mr. Isbellsaid he talked Mr. Perry out of going straight to the policeuntil a deal could be struck.   Charges against Mr. Harvey, who spent 11 days in jail,were dropped last week for lack of evidence and because Mr.Perry and his attorney were already negotiating with police.</TEXT></DOC>
