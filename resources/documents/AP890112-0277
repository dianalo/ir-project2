CLIFFORD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A congressional hearing convened to ``cleanup the mess'' in the nation's savings and loans was told Thursdaythat more than $220 million in losses from insider fraud have beenuncovered in thrifts in California, Nevada and Arizona.   The disclosure was contained in a half-inch-thick statement fromJames Cirona, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of SanFrancisco. Cirona, whose jurisdiction includes the three states,testified before the House Banking, Finance and Urban AffairsCommittee.   Cirona said that since August of 1987 his investigators hadreferred 5,384 cases of possible fraud or abuse to the U.S.attorney's office.   The statement given to the lawmakers said many of the cases``involve rather small amounts obtained fraudulently by borrowers ordepositors.''   ``However, we are particularly concerned by abuse by insiders,which may often involve very large sums of money,'' it said. ``Forthis reason we have established a special system of `priorityreferrals' that involves insiders or amounts in excess of $100,000.   ``We estimate that losses to 11th District institutions on thesepriority referrals, as of September 23, 1988, amounted to over $220million.''   Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, called for a fullanalysis of the crisis in the savings and loans industry, in whichgovernment bailouts exceeded $38 billion in 1988.   Estimates of the cost to rescue the remaining 350 or so involventthrifts have ranged from $50 billion to $75 billion.   The hearing was needed to ``clean up the mess that is already outthere,'' said the congressman, adding that more hearings would beheld in other major cities.   ``With both banks and savings and loans failing in recordnumbers, it is imperative that this committee fully understands howthe problems have developed in the industry and the manner in whichstate and federal regulatory agencies have responded to thecrisis,'' he said.   The lawmakers need to talk to the ``people who deal with theseproblems on a day-to-day basis,'' he said. ``For too long there hasbeen an overdependence on the wisdom of Washington-based bureaucratsfar removed from the scene of battle.''   The hearing was scheduled to continue Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
