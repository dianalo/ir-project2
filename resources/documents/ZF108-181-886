(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Cornell, Douglas W.; Yu, Philip S.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>An algorithm is developed for the optimal vertical partitioning ofthe physical design of a relational database to minimize diskaccesses in the resolution of a transaction or query.andP;  Systemthroughput in the utilization of large relational databases is, inlarge part, a consequence of the speed at which transaction orqueries to the database can be satisfied.andP;  Typically, much data isaccessed to retrieve or update a small amount of information.andP;  Thenew algorithm is a two-step process consisting of query analysisfor estimating the key parameters of an access process and binarypartitioning that can be applied recursively.andP;  The algorithm isimplemented as an integer programming technique that minimizes thenumber of disk accesses.andP;  Performance modeling is used todetermine the appropriate situations for the use of the algorithm.andO;Four examples demonstrate the algorithm's performance.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     AlgorithmsPerformance ImprovementRelational DBMSPartitioned FilesNew TechniqueInteger ProgrammingAccess TimeOn-Line Transaction Processing.andO;Feature:   illustrationtablegraph.andO;Caption:   Parameter values for transactions accessing a relation in fourcases.
