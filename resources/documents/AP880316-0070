Arlin Crotts made the observations at the Carnegie Institutionof Washington's Las Campanas observatory in Chile, the universityannounced Tuesday.   Theories predict that when a supernova explodes, some light fromthe flash would light up or reflect off dusty clouds of gas andshow up as faint arcs of light long after the peak brightness ofthe supernova.   Until now, however, no supernova has been close enough andbright enough to test this prediction, UT spokesman Danny Ewaldsaid.   Crotts found two arcs of light corresponding to echoes fromsupernova 1987A. The echoed light should be that which was emittedwhen the supernova was at its brightest, some 80 days after theexplosion was detected.   Crotts said the discovery of the light echo from supernova 1987Awas confirmation of a basic prediction on how a supernova shouldbehave.   The echo is useful for mapping the clouds of gas and dust thatsurround the supernova, much as terrain-mapping radar givesinformation on and contours, UT said in a statement announcing thediscovery.   According to scientists, previously observed supernovae havebeen so far distant from Earth that light echoes wereundistinguishable from the source, and the later-arriving light wasmisinterpreted as slower decay of the supernova.</TEXT></DOC>
