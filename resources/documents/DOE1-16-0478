This study has consideredthe feasibility of three designs for containers which would isolate thewaste from the environment for a minimum period of 500 to 1000 years.The study was sub-divided into the following major sections: manufacturingfeasibility; stress analysis; integrity in accidents; cost benefit review.The candidate container designs were taken from the results of a previousstudy by Ove Arup and Partners (1985) and were developed as the studyprogressed. Their major features can be summarised as follows: (A) athin-walled corrosion-resistant metal shell filled with lead or cementgrout. (B) an unfilled thick-walled carbon steel shell. (C) an unfilledcarbon steel shell planted externally with corrosion-resistant metal.Reference repository conditions in clay, granite and salt, referencedisposal operations and metals corrosion data have been taken from variousEuropean Community radioactive waste management research and engineeringprojects. The study concludes that design Types A and B are feasiblein manufacturing terms but design Type C is not. It is recommended thatmodel containers should be produced to demonstrate the proposed methodsof manufacture and that they should be tested to validate the analyticaltechniques used.</TEXT></DOC>
