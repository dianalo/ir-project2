He made the comments as the Soviet Union proposed heavyreductions in troops and armor in Europe and urged negotiations toeliminate all battlefield nuclear weapons from the continent.   The president also used his appearance before the veterans groupto reiterate support for his embattled nominee for secretary ofdefense, calling John Tower ``a fellow veteran'' and ``a fighter.''   ``And now he and I are fighting for what I think are some veryimportant principles _ principles that the American peopleunderstand, like fairness and truth,'' Bush said.   He also told the VFW, which boasts a national membership of 2.3million, that he wanted to enlist its help to fight ``a threat noless real than the adversaries you have battled'' _ drug abuse.   ``Your nation needs you again,'' Bush said. ``Meet with otherleaders in your community _ church, clergy, law enforcementofficers. Tell them the VFW volunteers are ready to help.''   Standing before a giant American Flag, Bush told his audience:   ``You have my word. As long as I am president, America will standfast on the front line in defense of freedom.''   On the ``key issue of change within the Soviet Union,'' Bushsaid, ``there are still far more questions than answers.''   He suggested that there remains great uncertainty on ``theultimate outcome of the events unfolding in the USSR.''   ``America and her allies must recognize that, even in light ofthe military cuts proposed by President Gorbachev, the Soviet Unionremains the most formidable military power facing the free world.''   In Vienna, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze calledMonday for percentage reductions of troops, tactical nuclear weaponsand combat aircraft in Europe by both the East and the West.   Shevardnadze proposed that both military blocs reduce troops and``the main categories of arms'' by 10 to 15 percent over the nexttwo to three years, and by larger amounts thereafter.   The Soviet proposal went far beyond the reductions NATO plans tosuggest at conventional arms talks beginning Thursday. Bush did notspecifically address Shevardnadze's comments in the speech to theVFW.   Bush called for ``an active effort in arms control to strive forincreased stability at lower levels, lower levels of armaments.''   But he said he would oppose any attempt by Congress to withdrawU.S. troops from Europe unilaterally.   ``Imprudent unilateral reductions are not the path to peace andsecurity and freedom,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
