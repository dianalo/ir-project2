Both Daily News management and union leaders remain at thebargaining table. However, after months of bitter verbalattacks by both sides, there's no sign of a truce. Observersof the negotiations say the Daily News, which is owned byChicago-based Tribune Co., could face a walkout by unionmembers within a month.</LP><TEXT>   The industry's most acrimonious newspaper labor battle inyears comes at a bad time for the Daily News, which hasposted losses for most of the last decade. It faces increasedcompetition from another tabloid, Times Mirror Co.'s New YorkNewsday, at a time when the New York advertising market isthe softest in years.   Almost every scenario the Daily News faces is a dire one,at least for the near future. Management has demanded majorcost and work concessions from the unions and says it isprepared to publish and distribute the paper in the event ofa strike. Even so, the Daily News stands to lose significantadvertising and circulation.   Union leaders say they hope to avoid a strike, yet severalof the unions have voted strike authorizations. Many workersface the loss of their jobs permanently if they do walk offtheir jobs. If there is a strike, the unions threaten to leada boycott of the paper by readers and advertisers.   The 1980s nearly ruined the Daily News and strainedTribune Co.'s commitment to publishing in New York. The DailyNews had revenue of $420 million in 1989, yet the paper wasonly marginally profitable. Over the past decade, the paperhas lost $115 million on $4 billion in revenue. Average dailypaid circulation has fallen by 400,000 copies since 1979; asof Sept. 30, 1989, the paper's circulation was 1.2 million,down 7% from 1988.   The union is charging mismanagement, and claims theTribune intends to win concessions, then sell off thenewspaper. James Hoge, publisher of the Daily News, is &quot;asociable guy, but as a publisher he's a 4 on a scale of 1 to10,&quot; said George McDonald, president of the Allied PrintingTrades Council. &quot;The News has bum management.&quot;   Daily News executives blame the heavy financial burden ofa bloated union work force. About 50% of the paper's revenuegoes to cover employee compensation, compared with 25% to 30%at most other major metropolitan papers.   As for selling the paper, media analysts doubt it willtake place. &quot;New York is the biggest media market in the U.S.The Tribune won't give that up,&quot; said Peter Appert, analystat C.J. Lawrence. &quot;If they can get even a mediocre profitfrom that huge base of revenues, it's worth pursuing.&quot;   The troubling situation is a familiar one for Tribune Co.In 1985, at the company's flagship Chicago Tribune, thepressmen and printers unions were broken in a prolonged andviolent strike. The Tribune management won control of hiringand eliminated costly labor abuses. The Daily News is lookingfor the same and Mr. Hoge claims that with concessions inhand, the Tribune will invest $500 million in new pressesable to print color pages.</TEXT></DOC>
