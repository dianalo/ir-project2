It also authorized constructionand launch of 10 replacement satellites.   The action brings to 42 the number of authorized domesticsatellites providing a variety of telecommunications services,including video and data services.   The FCC said the newly authorized satellites, set to be launchedthrough 1994, will provide domestic satellite capacity through theend of the century.   The last group of satellites was authorized in 1985. Of the 20spacecraft in the group, only four are being constructed. Theremaining 16 were casualties for various reasons, notably a slump inthe satellite industry following the explosion of the space shuttleChallenger in January 1986, which grounded the U.S. space programand severely limited commercial satellite launch options, said FernJarmulnek, an FCC satellite official.   The commission said it granted all of the applications itreceived for the orbital slots 22,300 miles above the equator. Theauthorizations leave nine slots unassigned, Jarmulnek said.   In making assignments, the FCC also changed the position ofcertain slots in the orbit as required by a recent agreement withCanada and Mexico expanding the orbital space assigned to those twocountries. In reassigning U.S. satellites, however, the UnitedStates retains the same number of orbital slots for its satellites.   As a result of the agreement, three U.S. satellites that are inorbit will have to relocate. This will be accomplished by firingsmall thruster rockets on the satellites that are used to fine-tunethe spacecraft's position in orbit.</TEXT></DOC>
