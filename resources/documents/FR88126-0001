These regulations will provide for moreeffective management of records maintained by the Office and, for recordsunder the Office's control and ownership, by other Federal agencies. Theseregulations also promulgate exemptions for a new system of records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>These regulations become effective February 25,1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>John Sanet, (202) 632-4455.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>These regulations were proposed inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on August 4, 1987, at 52 FR 28833. The 60-daycomment period ended on October 5, 1987. Four written comments were received.Two letters received from labor organizations stated that they had no commentsor recommendations to submit regarding the proposed regulations. An analysisof the other two written comments and the Office's decision on each appearsbelow. One labor organization suggested that a time frame be included in the regulations(andSection;297.306) for appealing an agency denial of a request by the subjectof a record to amend that record. While the Privacy Act does have a statutorytime limit regarding how long an agency has to decide an appeal from aninitial amendment decision, the law is silent on the time frame a requesterhas to file such an appeal. The experience of the Office indicates thatmost individuals appeal within 30 days from the initial decision. However,the Office does not find that imposing a strict regulatory requirementwill assist the individuals in exercising their appeal rights; therefore,the suggestion was not adopted.The same labor organization expressed concern that the suggested time frameof ``as soon as practicable'' in andSection;297.402(b) and andSection;297.403(g)for providing notice to the subject of a record of a compulsory legal processis too vague; it was suggested that the Office furnish the employee withsuch notice ``immediately upon its receipt.'' Additionally, it was recommendedthat the employee be furnished with a copy of the materials subject tothe compulsory legal process no later than seven days after such informationhas been forwarded to the court, thereby assuring an employee of a fullexercise of his or her legal rights. In responding to compulsory legalprocess for records it maintains, the Office first must try to locate thelast known address of the individual; when that can be done (usually byretrieving the Official Personnel Folder or retirement file), the Officethen immediately provides the employee with a <T3>copy of the notice </T3>of the compulsory legal process. The term ``assoon as practicable'' is necessary to allow the Office an opportunity tolocate the record containing the last address of the employee. At thattime, notification is immediately provided. Therefore, the office believesthat a reading of the entire andSection;297.402(b) accomplishes the objectivesof the suggestion and meets the statutory requirement of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(8).With respect to providing the data subject copies of the requested material,as required by the Privacy Act, the Office will provide such material ifthe data subject makes a specific request for it. The Office does not believethat providing the material without a specific request is appropriate ornecessary. Therefore, these two suggestions are not adopted.One agency suggested that andSection; 297.204, regarding access to recordsby a representative of a data subject, include a specific reference tounion representatives and that the regulations state whether the generaldesignation of a union as the employee's representative will grant accessby any union official, or whether the employee must specify the names ofthe union officials who are authorized to access the records. The PrivacyAct requires that an individual be provided access to records or informationcontained within a system of records that pertains to that individual.The Act further provides that an individual can designate ``a person ofhis own choosing'' to either assist or act for the individual in this regard.That representative can be a union, a law firm, a relative, or anyone theindividual designates in writing. If the individual wants a union or anyspecifically-named union official as a representative, the individual cando so by tendering such as written authorization. The Office does not findit appropriate to include in these regulations a specific reference tounion representatives (or to any other specific category or person). Todo so would lead to confusion over whether other categories of representatives,not specifically mentioned, are precluded from acting in a representativecapacity. Similarly, the term ``representative'' is understood to meanone who stands for or acts as an agent for the individual. This can meanan individual or it can mean a group of individuals, like a union or lawfirm, if the individual has chosen the group as the representative. Therefore,the suggestion is not adopted.The same agency also commented on andSection; 297.206(a) regarding fees chargedby the Office. The agency requested clarification of the phrase ``producea record'' in andSection; 297.206(a). The Office agrees the clarificationis needed and has modifed that section to state that the phrase ``producea record'' encompasses providing a photostatic copy of the record. In addition,the agency noted that, while the Privacy Act permits an agency to chargea fee when the data subject requests copies of records, the Freedom ofInformation Reform Act provides for the first 100 pages of reproductionof documents without charge; therefore, the last sentence of andSection;297.206(a) needs clarification. The Office is aware that the Privacy Acthas always permitted an agency to charge a data subject for copies of recordsprovided to the individual; however, it has always been the policy of theOffice not to charge individuals who request the first copy of the records.The Office's fee schedule is published at 5 CFR 294.109 and was modifiedin April of this year to reflect the requirements of the Freedom of InformationAct. As stated at 5 CFR 294.109(g), there will be no charge for the first100 pages of paper copies for requesters. This will include data subjectsmaking requests for access to their own records whether they submit a PrivacyAct request or a Freedom of Information Act request for access to theirrecords. It should be noted that andSection; 297.206 applies only to feescharged by the Office and does not place any restrictions on agencies inthis regard. Since the Office as a matter of policy does not charge forthe first copy of producing records to a data subject, no matter how manypages are provided, the Office does not believe this section warrants change.In those rare instances where an individual requests duplicate copies ofrecords and the total number of pages is less than 100, the Office as statedandSection; 297.206(a) will follow the established fee shedule and providethe total number of pages free of charge. Therefore, the suggestion wasnot adopted.Finally, the agency suggested that andSection; 297.404(g) be amended to includea statement ``Notice of the issuance of an ex parte order or subpoena isnot required if the system of records has been exempted from the noticerequirement of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(8) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j), by a Noticeof Exemption published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.'' The Office agrees with that suggestion andhas changed andSection; 297.403(g) accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation </ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because it is concerned onlywith the administration of personnel records for certain civilian employees.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 297 </ITAG>Privacy, Records, Government employees.<ITAG tagnum="34">U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
