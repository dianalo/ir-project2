Positron emissiontomography (PET) is one of the useful method for measurements of cerebralcirculation, because the local cerebral circulation can be measured accuratelyin three dimensions. Accordingly, PET studies were performed to measuredisturbance in cerebral circulation in head injured patients. The studyincluded a total of eleven patients with contusion. Several parameterswere measured including rCBF, rCBV, permeability and rCMRO/sub 2/ andthe data was analyzed for brains with and without contusion and for theirchronological changes. It was concluded that in the subacute stage, thecontused brains showed a decrease in rCBF, an increase in rCBV and anincrease in permeability.</TEXT></DOC>
