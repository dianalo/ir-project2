An Agriculture Department report by Roberta Cook of theUniversity of California, Davis, says cauliflower has joinedbroccoli as a favorite among the veggie expansionists.   ``Between 1978 and 1986, harvested acreage of broccoli increasedby 90 percent, while the number of states producing for the freshmarket grew from the traditional four (California, Texas, Oregonand Arizona) to include new producers such as Maine, North andSouth Carolina, New York, Illinois, Virginia, Oklahoma andColorado,'' she said.   The expansion is explained by the rapidly growing popularity offresh vegetables in the American diet and by the decliningprofitability of food and feed grains in the 1980s.   ``Unfortunately, the capacity of the fruit and vegetableindustry to absorb the additional acreage is limited,'' Ms. Cooksaid.   That is because there are more than 200 million acres in theUnited States used to produce grain, compared with only about 5million acres of fruit and vegetables.   ``Consequently, while shifting 2.5 percent of grain acreage intofruits and vegetables would not solve the excess supply problem ingrains, it would double fruit and vegetable acreage and devastateprices,'' she said. ``At the same time, other regions of the world,particularly Mexico and the Caribbean Basin Initiative countriesare expanding vegetable exports to the United States.''   California remains the dominant broccoli producer, with its areaincreasing to 106,400 acres in 1986 from 64,400 in 1978. However,California's share of the total U.S. broccoli acreage declined froma high of 96 percent in 1979 to 82 percent in 1986.   The California market share of broccoli production also droppedduring the 1978-86 period from 96 percent to 91 percent.   There has also been a rise in cauliflower production, with theharvested area rising 65 percent between 1978 and 1986, Ms. Cooksaid. Fresh market cauliflower production increased even more, tomore than 5.9 million hundredweight in 1986 from 1.85 million in1978.   California's market share of fresh market cauliflower increasedto 79 percent of the total in 1986 from 74 percent in 1978.   Although California has a climatic advantage during portions ofthe year, the competition in other states during the summer andfall has become significant.   ``The combined fall broccoli area in the Midwest, South and Eastamounts to an estimated 10,000 acres, compared with 28,000 acres inCalifornia,'' Ms. Cook said. ``Hence, this new broccoli acreagecompares to 35 percent of California acreage when viewed on aseasonal basis.''   Meanwhile, imports of fresh vegetables have increased sharplysince 1978. Despite the growth, however, she said broccoli importsstill represent only about 1 percent of the total U.S. supply,while cauliflower imports make up about 2 percent of the supply.   Mexico is the leading source of fresh broccoli imports, andCanada is the largest provider of imported cauliflower.   ``However, both Canada's and Mexico's share of the import markethas declined slightly while other exporting countries, includingGuatemala, Jamaica, Chile, Belgium, France and Israel havegained,'' Ms. Cook said.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A four-year experiment to control houseflieswith tiny parastic wasps and special traps is near an end, perhapspaving the way for use by consumers generally, says the AgricultureDepartment.   Richard Miller of the department's Agricultural Research Servicesaid the traps were used last year by a Laurel, Md., resident, PaulSchwartz, whose home is next to a horse farm. Flies bred in manureand straw bedding were a problem. It was impossible to eat outsidebecause of the flies.   Last summer, the experimental traps reduced the flies by anestimated 90 percent, Schwartz said.   Miller, whose work was reported recently by the agency, saidhouseflies can be major irritants in areas where many new housesare being built near farms. And they're a nuisance to farmers andlivestock, too.   The trap is painted white to attract the flies, and a stickycoating nabs them once they land. Miller said that while there isinterest in the pyramid traps, none is yet being producedcommercially.   Miller said the tiny wasp, Muscidifurax raptor, is a biologicalcontrol alternative to chemical sprays. The wasps are foundthroughout the United States and are natural enemies of the flies,while being harmless to humans. The wasps lay eggs in the flypupae, which are killed as the wasps develop.   ``These parasites are reared by the thousands and released tomaintain or augment natural (wasp) populations,'' Miller said. ``Inlast year's test we increased the wasp populations up to tenfold.''   Later, he said, traps were used to capture the surviving flies.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A year-end review by the AgricultureDepartment shows 1987 production of red meat totaled 38.7 billionpounds, down 2 percent from 1986.
