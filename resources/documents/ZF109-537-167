(editorial) (editorial)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Hancock, Bill.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Increasing network capability emerges in the consumer market ascomputer technology progresses.andP;  Because a significant number ofhomes are equipped with microcomputers, many state-of-the-artproducts use networks as part of their offerings.andP;  With the use ofan on/off switch connected to a control system that plugs into atelevision, home owners may monitor a wide range of areasincluding security, climate, lighting and lawn watering.andP;  CompactDisk/Interactive (CD/I) integrates features of a compact disc andvideodisc player yielding a unit that provides virtually unlimitedcapabilities: the unit supports CD-ROM music CDs, data CDs, audioCDs, video CDs and 12-inch video platters.andP;  A keyboard, monitor,mouse, processors and floppy and hard disk drives are otheroptional peripherals the unit may include.andP;  Integrated ServicesDigital Network (ISDN) interface cards for products increases.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Consumer ElectronicsAttitudeTrendsNetworksFuture TechnologiesGrowthHome Computer Market.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Bringing the network to the home frontandM;I have a passion for computing.andP;  Not only is it my profession, it is also myhobby.andM;Because I compute a lot, I have a lot of computers at home.andP;  So many, infact, that of the nodes in my abode (five VAXes, one PDP-11, three PCs, fourMacs, one System/36, one AS/400), all of them except the two new workstationsare on thin-wire Ethernet in one way or another.andP;  The workstations are on atest FDDI for now.andM;I was a consumer trade show not too long ago and saw some very interestingproducts the use networks as part of their offerings.andP;  For example, there wasa two-way video intercom system for homes that uses twisted-pair cable toallow room-to-room video phone access.andP;  Cost?andP;  Two hundred dollars per room.andO;A PC-to-PC video conferencing system that costs about $400 per node was alsoon display.andP;  Other video products included baby-room monitors, securityfacilities, scanners for televisions, integrated CD-ROM video and audiocomponents, and many more.andP;  Shielded twisted-pair cable seemed to be themedium of choice, although some implementations used coaxial cable.andM;On the data-oriented side of consumer products, distributed control andsecurity systems were the order of the day.andP;  For instance, there was atwisted-pair facility with infrared controllers that allows a home owner tomonitor security, climate, lighting, lawn watering and practically anythingelse with an on/off switch via a control system that plugs inta a television.andO;The neat thing about the security facility is that if an intruder isdetected, not only does the system call the police, but it also displays thelocation of the disturbance on every television in the house so the homeowner does not walk toward the intruder.andM;Of most interest was a newer technology that is referred to as CompactDisk/Interactive, or CD/I for short.andP;  Basically a souped-up compact disc andvideodisc player, the unit can support 5-1/4-inch CD-RO, music CDs,5-1/4-inch data CDs, 5-1/4-inch video CDs, 3-1/2-inch audio CDs and 12-inchvideo platters.andM;What's even more interesting is that the unit I experimented with alsoincluded a keyboard, hookups to NTSC for television and RGB monitors, amouse, and an 80386SX processor with room for a floppy disk drive and anoptional hard disk drive.andM;In other words, the mega-Pc has hit the home with every graphical goodyattached.andM;The unit also offers access to Compton's CD Encyclopedia (highly recommended,by the way) and other educational CDs as well as traditional PC softwarefacilities.andP;  (Some, such as Microsoft Office, are available directly on CD.)andO;Add on a modem, and every family's computational dreams come true.andP;  With theproper connectors, you can even wire the unit up to kitchen appliances (I sawa Mr. Coffee with a data connector--that's getting scary) and otherelectronic gadgets lying around the house.andM;Some folks here in the United States are already aware of Integrated ServicesDigital Network (ISDN) facilities and the services they can offer.andP;  In ISDN,each phone jack gets a minimum 64Kbit-per-second (Kbps) channel for voice anda 64Kbps channel of data with a 16Kbps channel for signaling (on-hook,off-hook, etc.).andP;  With ISDN, every telephone is a node on a massive networkthat permits almost anything to be connected to almost anything else.andM;ISDN is already in place in many countries outside the United States, andcomputer vendors such as IBM and Apple Computer are offering ISDN interfacecards for their products.andP;  (No modem is necessary because ISDN is a digitalnetwork.)andP;  More than 98 percent of the United States is already wired forISDN, and many major U.S.andP;  companies have installed various implementationsof ISDN.andP;  (McDonald's was one of the first ISDN customers way back in 1984.)andM;It is simply a matter of time before shopping, banking and many othertime-consuming activities can be done from one place.andP;  &quot;Telecommunications&quot;will bec oem a reality with ISDN, and we will all be better off in many ways.andM;History shows that once the consumer gets the hang of a technology, thattechnology grows rapidly, sometimes at an explosive pace.andP;  Computers werearound for a long time before PCs evolved; PCs were around for a long timebefore consumers decided that they weren't evil and, in some cases, wereactually benevolent.andP;  Since that time, we have seen PC and workstationexplosions in the workplace as well as at home.andM;Networking is poised to be the next explosion simply because all the PCs athome are lonely.andP;  Adding networking capabilities to homes will be beneficial.andO;Ane with the current oil scare caused by the crisis in the Persian Gulf, whynot invest in any energy management system to reduce home fuel expendituresand reduce overall costs and energy consumption?andM;In the last fuel crisis, we ran short of petroleum, but we witnessed anincrease in energy-efficient technologies to help save our scarce fuelsupplies.andP;  With the technologies of today, the network will be essential toproviding improved energy control.andP;  Moreover, with the latest energy crisisand costs going up dramatically in the last few weeks, the need to economizewill be real this winter.andP;  Technology might have some answers.andM;Networks are headed for the home.andP;  It's not a question of being an option.andO;In fact, networks will become more of a standard feature as home managementbecomes the next major buzzword and the need to manage more than homefinancials becomes the reality.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
