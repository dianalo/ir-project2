As with most radicaldepartures from the tried and true, don't hold your breathfor a quick, spectacular success.   Volume in the four British property-related futures on theLondon Futures andamp; Options Exchange was a dismal 264 contracts,worth $46 million in property values, during the first twodays of trading Thursday and Friday. Contracts based on amonthly index of commercial property capital values were themost actively traded, dealers said. The other three, based onindexes of commercial rents, residential properties andmortgage interest rates, hardly changed hands.</LP><TEXT>   By contrast, 1,600 contracts of a new naphtha contractwere traded when that minor new wrinkle in the establishedmarket for energy futures was launched last month by London'sInternational Petroleum Exchange.   The new property futures will have to trade 400 to 500contracts a day for the exchange to break even, dealers say.That's fewer than usual, partly because costs are being helddown by trading the contracts on a &quot;screen-to-screen&quot;computerized system, rather than through open outcry oftraders and brokers on an exchange floor. When propertyfutures are quiet, the screen traders can easily switch toother markets.   &quot;We expected trade to be poor at first,&quot; says Jon Payne,director of business development at the exchange, known byits acronym, Fox. He says the property industry, usuallycautious, is waiting to see how the market develops.   The new market is aimed at institutions and companiesinvolved in commercial and residential property, rather thanat individual speculators, Mr. Payne says.   &quot;It is a chicken-and-egg situation,&quot; says Keith Day, avice president of Dean Witter Futures Ltd., one of severalU.S. companies that are taking an active interest in the newcontracts. Potential participants are waiting and watching,he says, but the market can't grow until they deal.   &quot;Nevertheless, we were overwhelmed by property investors,fund managers, pension funds, insurance companies, propertydevelopers and builders who were interested in the progressof the market,&quot; Mr. Day says. Knowledgeable people in theproperty industry are also likely to speculate, he says, sotrading activity should eventually improve.   Brokers accounted for almost all the dealing in the firsttwo days, says Amanda Sudworth, property futures trader atRefco Overseas Ltd. It will take time to educate both thereal estate and investment communities about the instruments,she says. She thinks the property industry will find themarket useful because the contracts reflect expectations offuture property prices.   However, times aren't good for real estate. Traders expectthe $1.7 billion British property market to worsen during theremainder of this year and then recover from 1992 onward.   Commercial property September futures prices at 125.4points are down from the latest index level of 128.8 pointsand from 153 points in late 1989, dealers say. But June 1994futures prices indicate a 25% recovery in commercial propertyover the next three years, dealers say. Residential pricefutures are trading at 207 points, off from the latest indexvalue of 208 points and down from 255 points two years ago.   &quot;We intend trading because we believe the market has afuture,&quot; says Jim Beveridge, financial director of MEPC PLC,one of the U.K.'s largest property investors and developers,which owns a $7 billion portfolio of properties. He iswatching to see how dealings on the exchange progress.   The futures market will be a swift way to get in on theaction once property values begin rising, says Michael Payne,senior director, investment strategy, at Legal andamp; GeneralGroup PLC, a U.K. insurance company. But he doesn't expect tostart trading the new futures for several weeks.   &quot;The futures should be a good guideline for the propertymarket,&quot; says Michael Ross, president of Stockton EstatesLtd., a London commercial property company. He notes,however, that the underlying commercial indexes are based onsubjective valuations rather than real transactions.   &quot;We are considering using the market to hedge againstprice risks of our portfolio,&quot; says Paul Roberts, manager oftrading operations at Olympia andamp; York Canary Wharf Ltd., aunit of Olympia andamp; York Developments Ltd. in Toronto. But hethinks there might be problems trading daily in a marketbased on indexes that are computed monthly.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          Trading in petroleum futures early this week could showsome recovery as market players find bargains after Friday'ssharp declines. But many oil analysts, brokers and tradersare beginning to give weight to some bearish fundamentalsthat might, in the longer run, erode prices further.   Despite record-setting low inventories of gasoline forthis time of the year, gasoline futures prices couldn't holdon to gains made last week on reports of refinery problems.The damage, as it happens, was minimal, but the real culprit,apparently, is the sluggish demand for gasoline. Because ofthe recession and improved automotive fuel efficiency,gasoline demand is expected to be off by as much as 3% thissummer. In addition, several oil industry insiders areanticipating crude oil exports from war-ravaged Iraq andKuwait somewhat sooner than had been anticipated.                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans                                                                                                          Traders this week will be watching weather forecasts,which have predicted the best conditions for soybean plantingsince 1981. The price of the soybean contract for Julydelivery was down 10.25 cents a bushel on Friday to settle at$5.7225, and continued good weather for planting could pushprices even lower, analysts said.   In addition, tomorrow the Senate is expected to vote on aresolution introduced by Sen. Robert Dole (R., Kan.), whichurges President Bush to offer $1.5 billion in export bonuscredits for the Soviet Union to buy U.S. grain. Theresolution calls for three equal increments of credit: $500million immediately, $500 million more in the fall and anadditional $500 million after the beginning of next year.Eligibility for the credits would depend on the SovietUnion's record of repaying existing debts. If it getsadditional credit, the Soviet Union is expected to buy U.S.wheat, corn and soybean meal.                                                                                                          Precious Metals                                                                                                          The rally in futures prices early last week has run itscourse, said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst atPaineWebber. Silver and possibly gold prices could pull backthis week, he predicted.   Platinum, however, may be the exception. Last week'sjobless report showed layoffs in the auto sector slowing,which could indicate the worst is over for the industry, Mr.Savaiko said. Platinum would benefit from a pickup inauto-making because it is used in catalytic converters.   The Soviet Union remains the wild card, he said. If theU.S. grants additional credit for food purchases, the Sovietswill be under less pressure to sell platinum to raise foreigncurrency.   That applies to gold as well, but the Soviets aren't thedominant force in gold as they are in platinum. Moreover, theSoviets don't appear to have much gold to sell, Mr. Savaikoadded. The purity of Soviet gold appearing in Zurich is low,indicating the country may be selling its older bars becauseit's not producing much new gold, he said.   Precious metals may benefit if the dollar continues toweaken, Mr. Savaiko said. A lot of money went into the dollarbecause investors were disappointed with the mark. But if thedollar doesn't maintain its recent strength, those investorsmay flee out of &quot;paper&quot; to precious metals, he suggested.   On Friday, June gold ended $1 an ounce lower at $358.30.July silver lost 2.7 cents an ounce to finish at $4.058. Julyplatinum edged $1.20 lower to $393.60 an ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
