Col. William Higgins had reportedly beenhanged by terrorists, he headed for the Senate floor.   He didn't have a text prepared or need a meeting with his staff.He delivered a blunt assessment of how he believed Israel mighthave provoked the murder.   ``We cannot apologize for Israeli actions in this country, whenit endangers the lives of Americans in some far-off country, andperhaps a little more responsibility on the part of the Israelisone of these days would be refreshing,'' he said, a bitter edge tohis voice.   Dole's remarks sparked outrage from defenders of the Jewishstate, who said he was playing into the hands of the terroriststhemselves.   It was ``a contemptible slander'' that showed ``the gullibilityof its utterer,'' said Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif. ``It isprecisely what the murderers want people to think.''   But for Dole, jumping into controversy was nothing new. Hisstinging comments about Israel fit in a political style which hasput him at the pinnacle of Senate politics, even if it hassometimes hurt his ambitions for national office.   ``He enjoys it. Bob enjoys being in the middle of the fray. Heusually can handle it every well,'' says Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, hisKansas Republican colleague. ``It's something that really sparks anenergy. He likes a good political fight,'' she said.   Dole's zest for the jugular of an issue or an opponent has notalways served him well. It hurt him in 1976, when as Gerald Ford'srunning mate he earned a reputation as a mean campaigner.   More than a decade later, in losing the New Hampshire primary toGeorge Bush last year, Dole's ``mean'' image resurfaced when heangrily blurted that the then-vice president should ``stop lyingabout my record.''   Dole took more criticism for the remark than Bush ever took forhis hardball campaign, and it might have cost Dole another vicepresidential nomination.   But within the Senate, Dole's sometimes mercurial personality isaccepted as his style, raising the stakes when he wants a point tobe made.   ``It's nothing more than Bob Dole on course,'' said Sen. AlanSimpson, R-Wyo. ``He is our leader, and I think he does amagnificent job.''   Often Dole _ Senate minority leader for the last 4{ years _ actsin the role of a team player, such as his strong partisan attackson Democrats who refused to back the nomination of John Tower assecretary of defense.   This week, Dole suggested President Bush make a recessappointment of William Lucas, the nominee to head the civil rightsdivision of the Justice Department.   The Senate Judiciary Committee killed Lucas' nomination on a 7-7vote. A recess appointment would go around the normal confirmationprocess and put Lucas in the post through the end of next year _and would almost certainly provoke open warfare between theDemocratic Congress and the Republican White House.   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh said Wednesday he wasseriously considering it.   In the case of Israel, Dole was seen by many as saying what theWhite House couldn't say for diplomatic reasons.   ``He went further than I would have gone. But I don't think it'sever a bad thing for a message to go out that an ally should not betaken for granted,'' said Rep. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman ofthe Senate Intelligence Committee.   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., a freshman who disagrees with Dole onIsrael, said the statement in no way lowered his opinion of Dole.   ``To be leader of this group, you have to be able to work withall different factions,'' Mack said. ``He is a leader.''   ``Whether one agrees or not, the point of it is it's consistentwith describing his role here,'' said Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M.   While there was talk after last year's bruising politicalcampaign that Dole would somehow get revenge on Bush when hereturned to the Senate, the Kansan has proven a loyal soldier.   ``He has laid himself on the line for George Bush since weopened for business, and George Bush knows it and Bob Dole knowsit,'' said Simpson.   Dole and Bush have patched up any hard feelings and if there isany bitterness remaining between Dole and White House Chief ofStaff John Sununu, who helped Bush bring down Dole, they won't letthat come out, Simpson said.   If Dole still harbors any national ambitions, he knows that``the key to his success is support of this president,'' Simpsonsaid. ``Bob never looks back.''</TEXT></DOC>
