Potential projects include facsimile machines, navigationsystems and digital-telephone and other services to be builtinto Nissan automobiles, the two companies said. A Nissanspokesman said the field is sure to boom, noting that otherJapanese car makers seem to be pursuing similar jointprojects with electronics and communications companies.   Plans haven't yet reached the stage that companycapitalization or an establishment date has been decided, orthat both parties have committed to working together,spokesmen from Nissan and Hitachi said.   Hitachi's spokesman said that the company's average annualsales of automobile-related electronics equipment totalroughly 200 billion yen ($1.37 billion).                                                                                                          EUROPEAN CFC AGREEMENT                                                                                                          Seven chemical companies with European operations signedan agreement with the European Community to reduce theamounts of atmosphere-damaging chlorinated fluorocarbons usedin foam plastics.

MRS. MARCOS'S REQUEST                                                                                                          Imelda Marcos asked a Philippine anti-graft court todismiss ill-gotten-wealth cases filed against her by thegovernment of President Corazon Aquino. Mrs. Marcos's lawyerin Manila, Sergio Apostol, filed a motion with the court thatsaid the former first lady enjoys immunity because she wasfollowing the orders of her husband during his 20-year ruleover the country. Government lawyers opposed Mr. Apostol'smotion. No decision was immediately taken by the three-manpanel of judges.
