We want to be able to determine howthis surface changes (evolves) through time as demes go extinct, speciationoccurs, or parameters change. How the surface behaves when differentecological and genetic processes are occuring is mathematically formulated.We began by getting a qualitative picture of the topography of the surfacefor a particular ecological or genetic process. The surface changes whenadaptation or speciation is occuring so that the surface is continuouslyfluctuating and changing, sometimes in bizarre ways. Sometimes trajectorieson this complicated and folded surface change so rapidly they are difficultto detect. In order to theoretically and numerically analyze such a complicatedproblem we must at least be able to take snap shots of the dynamicalchanges of the surface. We have developed a vector field model of evolutionwhich involves modeling specific ecological and genetic processes asdifferential equations on a surface that synamically changes. We areusing this formalism to theoretically classify the effects of ecologicaland genetic processes on the FWH surface. Inclusion of such effects makethe FWH surface a dynamic surface.</TEXT></DOC>
