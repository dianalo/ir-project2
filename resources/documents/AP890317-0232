JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter saidtoday he had ``no hesitation in eating apples'' treated with thechemical Alar, saying the health risk was minuscule.   ``If you want to avoid food that has any potential health risk,you're going to have a very narrow diet _ you'll be down to 75pounds real fast,'' Yeutter told a meeting of the National NewspaperAssociation.   ``In my view the health risk of an apple that has been treatedwith Alar is nominal, is minuscule,'' he said.   The agriculture secretary's comments came as federal healthofficials tried to reassure parents that apples are safe forchildren amid conflicting claims about the possible health effectsof Alar and other chemicals used by growers.   ``I have no hestitation in eating apples whether they do or donot have treatment for Alar,'' Yeutter said. ``We ought not to befrightened by actions of carefully orchestrated media efforts intoaltering our consumption patterns,'' he said.   ``I have five children and five grandchildren and I would nothesitate to have them have these (apple) products now,'' Food andDrug Administration Commissioner Frank Young said today on ABC's``Good Morning America'' show.   Officials from the Environmental Protection Agency and the FDAtold Congress on Thursday there is no reason for parents or schoolofficials to stop giving apples or apple products to their children.   After reminding a Senate subcommittee of the quick action takenearlier this week by the FDA to get Chilean fruits off the marketbecause of fears of contamination, Young vowed he would do the samefor apples if he thought it necessary.   But Young told the panel the FDA has never discovered residues ofAlar, a growth-regulating chemical technically known as daminozide,in apples anywhere close to the minimum allowed by the EPA.   In 800 samples tested since 1981 for Alar, he said, the highestresidue level found was 8 parts per million,. The EPA allows amaximum level of 20 parts per million, he said.   ``There does not appear to be a need for panic,'' he said.   John A. Moore, acting deputy EPA administrator, said anysuggestion that children are gravely at risk ``is simply untrue.''   Moore criticized the recent study by a private environmentalgroup, Natural Resources Defense Council, which suggested thatchildren may be exposed to dangerous levels of carcinogenicchemicals in fruits and vegetables because they eat large amounts inproportion to their weight. The study singled out Alar.   Since the study, parents have reportedly been discarding applesand apple products. School districts in Los Angeles, Chicago, NewYork, San Francisco, Miami and elsewhere have stopped serving applesin school cafeterias.   Officials in Los Angeles said on Thursday that apples and someapple products that have shown no traces of pesticides in teststhere are being returned to school district cafeterias.   Although the EPA has acknowledged the link between daminozide andcancer, Moore said Thursday he considers the health riskinsufficient at current use and residue levels to warrant itsimmediate removal from the market.   Nevertheless, Moore said, the EPA would reject daminiozide if itwere a new chemical up for approval now, and the agency plans toseek its removal. He said that process could take three years.   In a separate statement, the EPA, FDA and the AgricultureDepartment said, ``The federal government believes that it is safefor Americans to eat apples.''   Despite that vote of confidence, the defense council reiteratedits concerns during testimony before the Senate subcommittee onchildren, family, drugs and alcoholism.   Actress Meryl Streep, a leader of Mothers and Others forPesticide Limits, questioned whether anyone knows the extent of thedanger from Alar and other pesticides on food products. She saidmany of the older pesticides have yet to be re-examined usingcurrent health standards.   ``I think what we don't know about this issue is what's soalarming,'' said Ms. Streep, who has three small children.   Government and industry witnesses said growers have sharplycurtailed their use of Alar in recent years because of the healthconcerns, even though its manufacturer, Uniroyal Inc., disputes EPAclaims that it is carcinogenic.   ``The apple market is dead as a doornail right now acrossAmerica,'' said Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, whose family is in theapple business.   Thomas Hale, president of the Washington Apple Commission, saidafter the Senate hearing that millions of dollars could be lostbecause of the controversy, but that it was too early to assess theeconomic consequences.</TEXT></DOC>
