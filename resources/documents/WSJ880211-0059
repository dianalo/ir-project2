In few places is that more true than in the area of occupational safety, where supporters and critics of the Reagan administration's enforcement policies clash on the meaning of injury data.    Using the Bureau of Labor Statistics' annual Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, officials of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration claim credit for a major reduction in the injury rate over the past 13 years. Critics, mainly in organized labor, use the same statistics to bolster their complaints about the administration's &quot;nice guy&quot; approach to enforcing regulations. They note that improvements halted in the early '80s and call for a return to earlier policies.    Before assessing the claims about the impact of the administration's enforcement policies, it's necessary to understand what the injury data really represent. As the accompanying table shows, the total injury rate has declined sharply since the early 1970s. As the table also shows, the drop was due solely to a sharp decrease in one of its components, the rate of injuries that didn't result in lost workdays. While that rate dropped by more than 40%, the rate of injuries that resulted in one or more lost workdays rose more than 30%. Which of the two rates -- if either -- tells the &quot;truth&quot; about changes in workplace risk?    Analysts at the Bureau of Labor Statistics acknowledge that the big drop in the rate of injuries that don't result in lost workdays wasn't due to any change in workplace risk, but instead was primarily, if not wholly, due to changes in employers' understanding of reporting requirements. In other words, this rate is not a valid indicator of risk trends and cannot be used to support claims about the impact of changes in enforcement.    The rate for injuries that result in lost workdays also is seriously flawed as a measure of risk levels. Recent research shows that the increases in the 1970s were strongly influenced by an improvement in workers' compensation benefits. Higher benefits increased the incentive for workers to report injuries to insurers and, ultimately, to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. More-liberal benefits may also help explain the increase in the number of lost workdays per worker. This rate has gone up even more sharply than the rate of injuries that result in lost workdays, indicating that the average injury leads to more lost time than it once did. Interpretations of the injury data should acknowledge the impact of compensation programs.    Studies also agree that the rate of injuries that result in lost workdays has a strong cyclical component. The rate tends to go down when business is slow and to rise when hiring picks up. This reflects the higher accident rate of inexperienced workers. Interpretations of the injury data should also take this factor into account.    Countering the critics' claim that safety hazards are growing is a striking decline in the fatality rate. Some of the improvement may reflect better medical treatment for accident victims. There also is evidence that the higher insurance premiums caused by more-liberal benefits have prodded employers to improve their safety performance.    Critics of OSHA argue that the decline in the fatality rate reflects the shift in employment from more-hazardous sectors such as construction and manufacturing to white-collar and service jobs. While there is some merit to that argument, it ignores the steep declines in the fatality rates within the manufacturing and construction sectors. While the fatality rate for the private sector as a whole dropped 28% between 1978 and 1986, the rate for manufacturing fell 26% and for construction, 42%. As with the injury rates, it's not clear what influence -- if any -- the Reagan administration's policies have had.    What are the changes in OSHA's enforcement policy during the Reagan years that have caused so much contention?    The sharpest change is OSHA's slash in the average penalty per violation by more than 50%.    Second is a policy that curtails physical inspections in the manufacturing sector. This means that when an OSHA inspector turns up at a work site, he begins his inspection with a &quot;records check&quot; (except when an inspection is triggered by a worker complaint or an accident). Only if the records show an injury rate higher than the manufacturing average does he perform a physical inspection.    The third big change is the shrinkage of OSHA's inspection force. The number of annual inspections remains unchanged, however, mainly because many more are targeted on the construction industry, where inspections require fewer manhours than they do in manufacturing. Today, construction-sector inspections account for about 60% of all inspections, compared with less than 30% in the 1970s.    It's impossible to interpret the true impact of these changes. One reason is that studies of OSHA show that OSHA policies have at best a small effect -- up to 10% -- on the rate of injuries and fatalities. Another reason is that none of the studies control for all of the variables described above.    The studies of OSHA do agree, however, that the number of OSHA inspections is a more important factor in preventing injuries than the size of its penalties. For this reason, the impact of the penalty reductions shouldn't be large.    Supporters of the records-check policy argue that it allows OSHA to focus on the bad actors; critics warn that it encourages employers to underreport injuries. A National Academy of Sciences panel reported last year, however, that it could find no evidence that the records-check policy has had any impact on underreporting.    As for the shift in inspections from manufacturing to construction, no studies exist on where inspections do the most good. It is intriguing that the decline in the manufacturing death rate halted in the early '80s. There may be a causal connection, but we also need to assess whether the shift accelerated the drop in the construction death rate.    The difficulties in developing accurate statistics on workplace injuries and in assessing OSHA's impact are disconcerting. Simplistic claims about the effects -- good or bad -- of OSHA policy changes should be viewed with skepticism. While it is possible that the changes under the Reagan administration have had an effect -- negative or positive -- on safety, the available evidence hardly forces us to either conclusion. Not only does the validity of the data as indicators of workplace risk remain uncertain, but there are no studies that control for the important variables.    When OSHA was established in 1970, the big concern was that many less-serious injuries were not being counted and so the Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys have emphasized getting a complete count. Despite all the political interest in counting workplace injuries, the most glaring intelligence failure for policy purposes is the absence of any serious effort to analyze the causes of workplace injuries and the efficacy of countermeasures. Although greater accuracy is desirable, OSHA's greater needs are better data on the causes of accidents and a commitment to policy experiments that would give it a fighting chance to find out what works.    ---   Mr. Mendeloff's most recent book is &quot;The Dilemma of Toxic Substance Regulation&quot; (MIT, 1988).
