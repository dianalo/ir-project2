The method makes use of NaI (Tl) detector coupledwith a multichannel analyzer. The 1 MeV gamma-ray of U-238 was used forthe calibration. The calibration curve was made by counting syntheticmixtures made of U308 powder, the heat treatment salt and iron in theform of fine powder. The uranium content in these synthetic mixtureswas kept in the range of 1-11%. 23 lots of the fused salt cake takenfrom three different batches of the salt cake were then analyzed by thismethod. The uranium content of fused salt cake was found to be in therange of 1.70-11.43%. To compare the gamma spectrometric results witha completely independent method, chemical analysis of all the fused saltcakes were also carried out. The NDA results were found to agree within+/- 17% with the chemical analysis results.</TEXT></DOC>
