Applicants are required to submit an original and twocopies of each application as provided in this Section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Frequent Questions </ITAG>1. <T3>Can I get an extension of the due date? </T3>No! On rare occasions the Department of Education may extend a closingdate for all applicants. If that occurs, a notice of the revised due dateis published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. However, there are no extensions or exceptionsto the due date made for individual applicants. 2. <T3>What should be included in the application? </T3>The application should include a project narrative, vitae of key personnel,and a budget, as well as the Assurances forms included in this package.Vitae of staff or consultants should include the individual's title androle in the proposed project, and other information that is specificallypertinent to this proposed project. The budgets for both the first yearand subsequent project years should be included. If collaboration with another organization is involved in the proposedactivity, the application should include assurances of participation bythe other parties, including written agreements or assurances of cooperation.It is not useful to include general letters of support or endorsement inthe application. If the applicant proposes to use unique tests or other measurement instrumentsthat not widely known in the field, it would be helpful to include theinstrument in the application. Many applications contain voluminous appendices that are not helpful andin many cases cannot even be mailed to the reviewers. It is generally nothelpful to include such things as brochures, general capability statementsof collaborating organizations, maps, copies of publications, or descriptionsof other projects completed by the applicant. 3. <T3>What format should be used for the application? </T3>NIDRR generally advises applicants that they may organize the applicationto follow the selection criteria that will be used. The specific reviewcriteria vary according to the specific program, and are contained in thisConsolidated Application Package. 4. <T3>May I submit applications to more than one program competition NIDRRor more than one application to a program? </T3>Yes, you may submit applications to any program for which they are responsiveto the program requirements. You may submit the same application to asmany competitions as you believe appropriate. You may also submit morethan one application in any given competition. 5. <T3>What is the allowable indirect cost rate? </T3>The limits on indirect costs vary according to the program and the typeof application.Applications that are for training activities, including all applicationsin the Research Training grants program, should limit indirect chargesto the lesser of the actual indirect costs or eight percent of the totaldirect costs of the program, as noted in the Education Department GeneralAdministrative Regulations (EDGAR). The statutory limit for indirect chargesin the Rehabilitation Research and Training Centers program is 15 percentof total project costs. All other applicants in the Randamp;D, Dandamp;U, REC, FIR, Innovation grants,and Spinal Cord Injury programs should limit indirect charges to the organization'sapproved rate. If the organization does not have an approved rate, theapplication should include an estimated actual rate. 6. <T3>Can profitmaking businesses apply for grants? </T3>Yes. However, for-profit organizations will not be able to collect a feeor profit on the grant, and in some programs will be required to sharein the costs of the project. 7. <T3>Can individuals apply for grants? </T3>No. Only organizations are eligible to apply for grants under NIDRR programs.8. <T3>Is there a cost-sharing or matching requirement? </T3>Cost-sharing is required in the Research and Demonstration Projects program,with certain exceptions noted in the law; and the Knowledge Disseminationand Utilization program. For the Rehabilitation Engineering Centers, theSecretary has the option to require matching. It is generally the practiceof the agency to require cost-sharing under this program. There is no set rate for cost-sharing. The cost-sharing is negotiated atthe time an award is made and is not part of the evaluation of the application.9. <T3>Can NIDRR staff advise me whether my project is of interest to NIDRRor likely to be funded? </T3>No. NIDRR staff can advise you of the requirements of the program in whichyou propose to submit your application. However, staff cannot advise youof whether your subject area or proposed approach is likely to receiveapproval. 10. <T3>How do I assure that my application will be referred to the most appropriatepanel for review? </T3>Applicants should be sure that their applications are referred to the correctcompetition by clearly including the competition title and CFDA number,including alphabetical code, on the Standard Form 424, and including thetitle of the priority to which they are responding. 11. <T3>How soon after submitting my application can I find out if it willbe funded? </T3>The time from closing date to grant award date varies from program to program.Generally speaking, NIDRR endeavors to have awards made within five tosix months of the closing date. Unsuccessful applicants generally willbe notified within that time frame as well. For the purpose of estimatinga project start date, the applicant should estimate approximately six monthsfrom the closing date, but no later than the following September 30. 12. <T3>Can I call NIDRR to find out if my application is being funded? </T3>No! When NIDRR is able to release information on the status of grant applications,it will notify applicants by letter. The results of the peer review cannotbe released except through this formal notification. 13. <T3>If my application is successful, can I assume I will get the requestedbudget amount in subsequent years? </T3>No. Those budget projections are necessary and helpful for planning purposes.However, a complete budget and budget justification must be submitted foreach year of the project and there will be negotiations on the budget eachyear. 14. <T3>Will all approved applications be funded? </T3>No. It often happens that the peer review panels approve for funding moreapplications than NIDRR can fund within available resources. Applicantswho are approved but not funded are encouraged to consider submitting similarapplications in future competitions. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4000-01-M 006 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 469-474 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4000-01-C  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Research and Demonstration </T3>(84.133A) <ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Rehabilitation Research and Training Centers </T3>(84.133B) <ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Innovation Grants </T3>(84.133C) <ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Knowledge Dissemination and Utilization </T3>(84.133D) <ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Research Engineering Centers </T3>(84.133E) <ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Research Fellowships </T3>(84.133F) <ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Field-Initiated Research </T3>(84.133G) <ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Special Demonstrations for Spinal Cord Injuries </T3>(84.133N) <ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Research Training Grants </T3>(84.133P) Public reporting burden for these collections of information is estimatedto average 30 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the date needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information.
