Margaret, a widow whosechildren had left the nest, and Raymond, a refugee from arecent divorce, discovered they adored the same obscureBook-of-the-Month Club selection, Louise Dickinson Rich's &quot;WeTook to the Woods.&quot; Next they found they were passionateabout nature, hiking and each other, and they tied the knot-- just like the couple in Rich's story.   The Cashels initially met in 1970 because both belonged toSingle Booklovers, a 1,300-member social club that helpslonely lovers of the written word locate each other, date andmate. The novel idea behind the club, which was created 20years ago by retired Exxon engineer Bob Leach, 66, during hisown days as a literate widower, is that readers are morelikely to find soulmates among other readers, and that thebest way for them to recognize each other is to compare listsof their favorite books.</LP><TEXT>   Here's how it works: Members of Single Booklovers -- whichis run by Bob and his second wife, Ruth, 52, from thebasement of their home in Gradyville, Pa. -- pay a $52 annualfee and fill out a personal profile sheet detailing suchinformation as occupation, qualities sought in a date ormate, favorite music, movies, plays, magazines -- and ofcourse books. A two-line summary of this is circulated to allclub members of the opposite sex, who, if intrigued, canrequest the corresponding profile sheet and woo its author.   During Single Booklovers' first year, membership consistedmostly of Pennsylvania Quakers like Bob and Ruth. But afterthe club started advertising in publications such as the NewYork Review of Books, Harvard magazine and the MensaBulletin, membership diversified and spread across thecountry. So far, more than 400 marriages have resulted.   Birmingham nursing student Aminta O'Connor and Atlantacomputer consultant Ken Nichols were both 33, virgins atmarriage and starved for locals with whom to share the NewYork Review of Books, art films and the avant-garde rockmusic of Brian Eno. Their profile sheets indicatedoverlapping interests, so Aminta dropped Ken a card in July1987, even though he sounded nerdy compared to the rockmusicians she usually dated.   &quot;I went for the bad-boy/outlaw types, psychopaths in thebud,&quot; Aminta says cheerfully. &quot;If I had met Ken under anyother circumstances, I would not even have talked to him.&quot;But because Single Booklovers fostered blind intellectualchemistry, Aminta wrote herself into the most harmoniousrelationship of her life. Says Ken, who married her less thana year after getting hooked on their aestheticcorrespondence, &quot;We'll finish each other's sentences, oranticipate each other's thoughts. Even my friends who seemhappily married don't have as much in common as we have.&quot;   Garett Wink, a General Motors auto worker from St. Louis,was a shy man who'd never brought a woman home to Mom when hefirst joined Single Booklovers in the mid-'70s. Years ofcorresponding with women across the country helped bring himout of himself, so at 46 he was ready when 47-year-old BettyBallard, center coordinator of Literacy Volunteers of NewYork City, first came into his mailbox in early 1987. Bothliked reading biographies, history and science, so theyexchanged intellectual letters for about six months. They metthat September.   &quot;I was in a fog for about a day,&quot; says Betty, who hadn'thad a date in five years and had been expecting a solitaryold age. Instead, Garett invited her to share Christmas, NewYear's, his house and his bed if she felt so inclined --which she did. Garett popped the question on their thirdface-to-face encounter, and the two enunciated their marriagevows in September 1988.   Dana Joyce, a 37-year-old Montessori teacher and singleparent living in Oklahoma City, and Bob Campbell, 39, an ATandamp;TFoundation consultant from Highland Park, N.J., startedtalking matrimony before they'd even met. &quot;I know it soundsweird,&quot; says Bob, a self-described counterculturalistalienated from New York yuppies like his first wife, &quot;but Iknew Dana probably better than anyone else because of ourletters.&quot; His March 1989 introduction -- a 15-page discourseon himself and his philosophy of life, complete with favoritequotes from Plato and Rilke -- squarely hit the spot forDana, another '60s iconoclast and former philosophy major.   Soul-baring weekly letters turned to nightly long-distancephone calls. Two weeks after a week-long first date, Bobpacked a rented truck and moved to Oklahoma City. He and Danamarried in November 1989, and in August Dana gave birth totheir daughter. &quot;Dana's the best thing that's ever happenedin my life,&quot; Bob says gratefully. &quot;But without SingleBooklovers, there was no way we could have ever met.&quot;   Single Booklovers doesn't work nearly so well foreveryone. The majority of members, divorced or widowed womenover 40, rarely get off the vellum and between the sheets.The club can be a haven for loners preferring intimacy at adistance. And letters alone don't always divulge personalityquirks or give any indication of how two people will relatein the flesh. A 40-year-old librarian from Silver Spring,Md., was affianced to a 39-year-old technical writer fromTustin, Calif., until he relocated to her town, startedcarping at her, she says, and then decided they had nothingin common.   Still, members like 48-year-old Tampa journalist LarryThornberry -- the kind of guy who likes the idea of readingRobert Frost to his inamorata, both in and out of bed -- findthe Single Booklovers a logical gamble.   &quot;What I'm looking for is a woman to share my life with,and it would help if we had that common interest,&quot; he says.&quot;If you're a little bookish and off the beaten track, you'repicking out of a smaller pool, and this helps.&quot;   ---   Ms. Coleman is a free-lance writer living in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
