Holding of 80%Will Be Acquired by Warburg Group---By Ken WellsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)RETAILING (RET)COMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   An investment group led by E.M. Warburg, Pincus andamp; Co. agreed to buy an 80% stake in ComputerLand Corp., the nation's largest retail computer franchiser.    Terms weren't disclosed, but sources suggested the New York investment concern would pay on the order of $200 million for the holding in the 800-store chain. ComputerLand, with sales of $1.45 billion in the year ended Oct. 31, had been valued at more than $1 billion by investment bankers just three years ago. William H. Millard, who founded and controls 96% of the company, had said in June 1986 that he was seeking a buyer for ComputerLand; one company that had expressed interest said at the time that he was asking about $400 million for the chain.    The Warburg group described the agreement as a cash acquisition rather than a leveraged buyout, which entails substantial debt financing. The transaction also was said to include a substantial cash infusion from Warburg Pincus. Sources also suggested that Warburg Pincus will take the company public within the next year or two, though ComputerLand President Ken Waters said the company has no such current plans. ComputerLand's current management would be unchanged by the transaction, Mr. Waters added.    The sale, to be completed within the next 90 days, will leave Mr. Millard and Micro/Vest, a Hayward, Calif., investment concern, battling over the remaining 20%, or $50 million, chunk, sources close to the transaction said. Mr. Millard technically controls 96%. But an estimated 28.5% of that stake is held in trust, pending the outcome of Micro/Vest litigation against Mr. Millard.    Under terms of Warburg Pincus's proposal, Mr. Millard will surrender all of his undisputed stake in the company. Of the disputed 28.5%, Micro/Vest -- agreeing to allow the sale to proceed -- will be allowed to sell 8.5 percentage points of the disputed interest to Warburg Pincus and retain that cash, regardless of the outcome of the ComputerLand litigation, sources said.    In 1985, an Alameda County court jury awarded Micro/Vest 20% of Mr. Millard's ComputerLand stock plus $141 million in punitive damages. Micro/Vest had sued, alleging that Mr. Millard had willfully refused to honor the terms of a nine-year-old $250,000 note that allowed the note's holders to convert it to the 20% stake.    In lieu of a posting a $283 million appeals bond, Mr. Millard got an agreement from Micro/Vest, allowing him to proceed with an appeal in exchange for increasing the award to the 28.5% stake should the judgment be upheld. A decision on the appeal is expected within several months.    The remaining 20% will be held in trust, and should the lower court verdict be upheld, Micro/Vest would receive a 20% stake in ComputerLand. If the judgment is overturned, that stake reverts to Mr. Millard, sources close to the transaction said. Various private investors hold 4% of the computer retailer.    Mr. Millard currently resides in Saipan, in the Northern Marianas Islands near Guam. He wasn't available for comment.    John Martin-Musumeci, a principal holder in Micro/Vest, said, &quot;My feeling is that this is a good time to be buying ComputerLand, not selling it.&quot; But Mr. Martin-Musumeci said that while the price for ComputerLand &quot;appears to be lower than we had hoped,&quot; other provisions of the transaction appear favorable to the investor group.    If, for example, Warburg Pincus does later decide to take ComputerLand public, Micro/Vest holders then could decide upon an option of cash or stock, thus allowing them to participate &quot;in any upside of a ComputerLand public offering,&quot; Mr. Martin-Musumeci said.    For years after its founding in 1976, ComputerLand nearly ruled a computer retail market that was growing rapidly and included few competing franchisers. But a pervasive sales slump in the computer market beginning in 1984 plus blossoming competition combined to erode the company's value.    Mr. Millard, assuming the estimated $200 million selling price for the 80% stake, would gross perhaps $175 million on his undisputed holdings. His move to Saipan seemed designed to take advantage of the island's tax code, which, as a U.S. protectorate with status similar to Puerto Rico's, rebated 95% of U.S. taxes to bonafide residents. But Mr. Millard, after establishing residency on the island, found himself in a squabble with Saipan's legislature, which amended its tax code and reduced that rebate to 25%.    Subsequently, Congress, in an amendment to the federal tax code, adopted a provision that appears to require a 10-year residence on Saipan before a resident may take advantage of the tax code for disposition of assets held elsewhere. Mr. Millard is said to have subsequently put his ComputerLand holdings into a family trust, further complicating his tax situation.    ComputerLand's Mr. Waters said the Warburg group's announcement is &quot;welcome news&quot; at the company, which has had to contend with significant upheavals in the personal computer market as well as the worrisome dispute between Mr. Millard and Micro/Vest. Mr. Millard formerly served as ComputerLand's chairman and chief executive officer until September 1985, when he stepped aside following the Micro/Vest verdict.    His decision to leave ComputerLand's management also resulted from a revolt by ComputerLand franchisees, who chafed under what they considered Mr. Millard's autocratic management style and burdensome franchise fees.    Warburg Pincus, though best known for its venture capital activities, lately has moved aggressively into investment banking. It is said to be interested in ComputerLand largely because of its dominance in a rebounding retail computer market, which augurs well for the company's growth.    Earlier this year, Warburg Pincus gained control of Symbion Inc., maker of the Jarvik-7 artificial heart and other artificial organs. Warburg Pincus was a participant in the 1985 leveraged buyout of SFN Cos., a communications and publishing company, and in 1984 it bought a large stake in Mattel Inc., the toy maker. </TEXT></DOC>
