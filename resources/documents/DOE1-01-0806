<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-01-0806 </DOCNO><TEXT>The basic physical problems determining the fusion prospects of the opentraps are considered. Main attention is paid to the possibility of ascalable modelling of the anomalous transverse transport in long solenoids(which are a necessary component of most of the types of open traps),and to the problem of the MHD stability of axisymmetric ambipolar traps.The experimental device for studying the transverse transport in a longsolenoid, based on the concept of a gas-dynamic trap, is described. Variousaxisymmetric MHD - stabilizers for ambipolar traps are considered, includingthe recently suggested stabilizer in the form of a ''fat'' mirror machine.Such a stabilizer is shown to provide the suppression of large-scaleflute perturbations in the framework of a ''natural'' geometry of opentraps.</TEXT></DOC>
