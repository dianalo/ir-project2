The seating arrangement at Friday's encounter was no coincidence.   The armed forces, which never took the rebels' ideas for thisyear's presidential election at face value, demonstrated theircontinued influence _ some would say domination _ in politicsthroughout recent weeks.   The proposal by leftist rebels to postpone the March 19presidential election to allow them time to participate appeareddoomed by last weekend, though all involved hesitated to say sopublicly. None relished the stigma of spoiler.   On Sunday night, Duarte made a counter offer, proposing to letthe Salvadoran people vote on whether to accept the rebels' offer.He offered a cease-fire this week and a meeting between rebels andthe government.   Speaking on nationwide radio and television, Duarte suggestedopening peace talks with the rebels starting Tuesday after immediateagreement by the government and insurgents to a cease-fire.   The guerrillas' plan represented a dramatic turnabout for rebelswaging a nine-year civil war against the U.S.-backed government.   The guerrillas had boycotted, condemned and done all they couldto impede the five previous national elections this decade. Theycontend elections have been part of a U.S.-imposed counterinsurgencyproject to provide a facade of democratic civilian rule over anedifice of military repression.   After the rebels made their proposal, the country's 13 politicalparties sent representatives to two days of talks to discuss it withfour rebel leaders at a Mexican resort.   The insurgents originally proposed putting off the election untilSeptember to give them time to marshal their political forces andtake part. In Mexico, they said they could go along with an electionin July.   The rebels also called for security and anti-fraud guarantees.   In exchange, they promised to recognize the legitimacy of thegovernment that arose from the vote _ implicitly accepting thatarmed struggle would then be illegitimate.   Soon after the Mexico meeting, the Defense Ministry declared itsstand.   ``Postponing the election until September is impossible,''Defense Minister Gen. Carlos Vides Casanova told reporters, invokingthe constitution.   At first, some parties also had constitutional qualms aboutputting off the vote, but those were overcome in most cases whensome jurists said it could be done legally.   Postponement would have required consensus among the parties, butthat prospect was virtually nil before the politicians even went toMexico.   ``No one in Mexico had the right or faculty to agree topostponement,'' Francisco Merino, vice-presidential candidate forthe rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, told TheAssociated Press on Friday.   Postponement, he said, ``could bring even bigger problems to thecountry, because it could divide the armed forces.''   Mario Aguinada, leader of the leftist Nationalist DemocraticUnion, told the AP last week that rightist and centrist partieswhich may have been tempted to consider the guerrilla proposal weredissuaded by the military's uncompromising stance.   ``They were scared,'' he said.   Arena soundly defeated the incumbent Christian Democrats inlegislative and municipal elections last year, and it is alsofavored to take the Presidential Palace from the Christian Democratsin the upcoming elections. It never indicated a willingness toaccept postponement.   However, one party leader who had gone to Mexico told journalistsFriday that even the Christian Democrats balked at anything morethan a brief delay during the meetings there.   If the vote were postponed more than a couple of months, thelegislature would have to name an interim president. Arena controlsthe legislature and presumably would name one of its own members.   Fear of losing the campaign advantage of incumbency motivated theChristian Democrats to block postponement, according to severalparticipants speaking on condition of anonymity.   This proposal, though dead, may have boosted long-term peacepropects.   The guerrillas have been pursuing a ``two-lane'' strategy ofcombat and negotiation, Guillermo Ungo, presidential candidate ofleftist Democratic Convergence, said in an interview Friday. He isformally allied with the rebel army.   ``The two aspects do not exclude each other. They complement eachother,'' he said.   The guerrillas, in response to rejection of their proposal, saythey intend to step up attacks sharply in coming months.   But Ungo said the ``negotiating lane'' has not been definitivelyblocked.   ``This (guerrilla) offer does not remain valid. It was tailoredfor this moment. What remains valid is the idea of negotiation,'' hesaid.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Douglas Grant Mine covers El Salvador for TheAssociated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
