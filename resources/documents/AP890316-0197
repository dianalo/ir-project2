President Mobutu Sese Seko argues that Belgium exploited hiscountry before and after it gained independence in 1960.   ``We were cheated by Belgium,'' he said recently.   ``Our good faith was abused. Now that we are equals, we want toput everything into question again.''   He insists that Belgium has a moral duty to do more to help Zaireout of its $7 billion foreign debt.   He intends to raise the question at a top-level ministerialconference tentatively set for sometime this spring.   For its part, Belgium says it is ready to discuss a reschedulingof Zaire's debt but will not renegotiate the treaties it signed withZaire in 1965 or discuss the way it granted independence almostovernight in 1960.   Belgian-Zairean relations have been punctuated by criticism hereon grounds that Mobutu's rule is authoritarian and disregards humanrights, and by complaints in Zaire about Belgian shortcomings inhelping its former colony.   Zaire contents that Prime Minister Wilfried Martens of Belgium,on a visit in November, was hardly generous in helping to easeZaire's foreign debt.   Yet Martens' offer _ forgiving $25 million of the $125 millionZaire owes Belgium _ was large enough to renew criticism in theBelgian media and Parliament about the way Mobutu has run his nationsince he seized power in a 1965 coup.   An angry Mobutu said he would have broken relations with Belgiumhad King Hassan II of Morocco not proposed to mediate.   Zaire insists the ministerial meeting this spring should touch onold colonial disputes.   ``The investigation of the disputes will show exactly who oweswhat to whom,'' Mobutu said.   He added that unless Belgium agrees to discuss colonial times, hewill go to the International Court of Justice in The Hague,Netherlands, also known as the World Court.   Mobutu claims Belgium exploited his nation's mineral wealthbefore and after independence and keeping all the proceeds.   Some here agree Belgium owes Zaire a moral debt but questionMobutu's timing and motives for bringing the matter up now.   ``Belgium has a historical debt,'' said Economic Affairs MinisterMinister Willy Claes. ``(But) discovering these so-called truths 25years late ... is not very credible.''   ``Politically, colonization was a debacle and largely linked toBelgium's attitude,'' said Jean-Claude Williame of the African Studyand Documentation Center in Brussels. ``But you cannot convert themoral argument into money.''   King Leopold II gained personal control of the Congo in 1885 andimposed a regime of forced labor.   In his book ``Red Rubber, Leopold II and his Congo,'' the Africaspecialist Daniel Vangroenweghe wrote that the harshness of theregime and disease depleted half the colony's population in 40 years.   Leopold had earned a personal fortune and the scorn of worldpublic opinion when the Belgian state took control of the territoryfrom him in 1908.   ``I will give them my Congo,'' Leopold said at the time, ``butthey have no right to know what I did there.''   Several Belgian companies made their fortunes in the Congo in thepast century, among them Societe Generale de Belgique SA which todayis Belgium's largest holding company.   Four Belgian companies _ all controlled by Societe Generale _ noware drawing a net benefit from Zaire of about $300 million a year,largely through mining and refining of Zairean copper, diamonds andcobalt.   Belgium is Zaire's fourth largest creditor after the UnitedStates, France and West Germany.   Mobutu, known in Zaire as ``The Savior Guide,'' rejects chargesthat he is authoritarian with little regard for human rights andthat he has enriched himself at the expense of his 34 million people.   His response is that he saved Zaire from political chaos,restored law and order and created a nation out of a kaleidoscope ofethnic tribes.   ``If I think what the country owes me,'' he said, ``I get weakinside, and tears well in my eyes.''   His critics, however, point to his sizable real estate holdingsacross Europe, his palatial residence in his hometown of Gbadoliteand a personal fortune said to run into billions of dollars.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thurs PMs March 23</NOTE></DOC>
