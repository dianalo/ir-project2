The official said the United Sates is expected to make therequest when U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William H. Taftvisits Seoul on May 10-11.   ``If the United States makes a formal request, we will studyit,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Korean newspapers reported from Washington that the UnitedStates will ask South Korea to help defense efforts in the PersianGulf by providing $20 million worth of free maintenance to Americanwarships. The U.S. Navy is guarding the shipping lanes which havebecome dangerous most notably because of Iranian attacks on neutralshipping.   Iran attacks neutral shipping in retaliation for Iraqi strikeson Iranian oil industry targets. The two countries have beenfighting for 7{ years.   The United States believes South Korea, which imports more thanhalf of its crude oil requirements through the Persian Gulf, isobliged to contribute to the defense cost, the reports said.   The ministry official denied that South Korea has received anyU.S. request. The Dong-A Ilbo, a leading South Korean newspaper,said Washington made an informal request through U.S. militarychannels a month ago.   Dong-A, quoting unnamed Korean government sources, said theUnited States is also asking South Korea to aid the Philippines aspart of efforts to step up security in the Pacific region.   South Korea has not made any decision on the matter, it said.   Dong-A said even if South Korea decides to accomodate the U.S.request for contributing to the defense efforts in the PersianGulf, it would be in the form of ``technical assistance'' ratherthan cash or sending troops or warships.   The official said South Korea would have to be careful about theU.S. request because ``contributing to the defense efforts in thePersian Gulf would consequently mean our involvement in the warbetween Iran and Iraq.''   ``Since we are in a delicate position between Iran and Iraq, wecannot accept any U.S. request in its entirety,'' the official said.   The official said, however, that Seoul would favorably consideranother U.S. request to provide more money for the support of43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.   South Korea currently contributes more than $100 millionannually in direct upkeep cost, in addition to $1 billionindirectly through tax and rent exemptions for the public landsused by the U.S. military here.   The United States is reportedly asking South Korea to increasethe direct upkeep cost by $120 million a year.   News reports quoted U.S. officials as saying that South Korea,which enjoyed a record $9.78 billion trade surplus with the UnitedStates last year, can afford to contribute more.</TEXT></DOC>
