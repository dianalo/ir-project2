Equiticorp, a New Zealand-based investment company, also said it agreed to buy 11.9 million Guinness Peat shares from some of the former owners of Forstmann-Leff Associates Inc. Guinness Peat bought the New York-based fund manager last year for $90 million in cash and stock. The share purchase would boost Equiticorp's stake in the United Kingdom merchant-banking group to 39.2% from 35.6%.    Equiticorp's new offer values the group at #356.3 million ($586.8 million). Guinness Peat called the bid &quot;inadequate&quot; and said it doesn't &quot;reflect the underlying value of Guinness Peat's businesses or their prospects.&quot;    But Guinness Peat also indicated yesterday that its previously negative attitude toward the New Zealand-based investment company is softening. Guinness Peat said the sweetened offer followed &quot;amicable discussions&quot; earlier this week with Equiticorp's board. The two companies also talked about establishing &quot;a satisfactory working relationship&quot; with Equiticorp as Guinness Peat's major shareholder, Guinness Peat said.    And Guinness Peat's chairman, Alastair Morton, a bitter opponent of Equiticorp's offer since the first proposal last month, has offered to resign if Equiticorp obtains more than 50% of Guinness Peat's shares, the merchant-banking group also said.    Mr. Morton couldn't be reached for comment yesterday. But Michael Kerr-Dineen, Guinness Peat's managing director, said: &quot;Equiticorp are shareholders. It's incumbent on any management team to see if you can work with major shareholders.&quot;    Whether Equiticorp will obtain a majority shareholding still is unclear, analysts said. Equiticorp needs only about 10% more of Guinness Peat's shares to own half of the merchant-banking group, noted Bernard Lardner, an analyst at the London brokerage firm Alexanders Laing andamp; Cruickshank.    Wayne Gerry of Kleinwort Grieveson agreed but said shareholders likely wouldn't accept Equiticorp's offer while Guinness Peat's shares trade above the 115-pence offering price. In late trading yesterday on London's stock exchange, Guinness Peat stood at 119 pence a share, up three pence from Tuesday.    But Equiticorp thinks it may have nearly won the takeover battle. &quot;We believe we effectively have control of the company. They (Guinness Peat) conceded that&quot; in their statement about the amicable talks, said Neil Goldie-Scot, a manager at Samuel Montagu andamp; Co., Equiticorp's adviser.    The British publisher Robert Maxwell added a twist to the takeover battle when he said yesterday that he had bought 8.1 million Guinness Peat shares, boosting his stake to 2.57% of the company's shares outstanding from less than 1%.    Mr. Maxwell, a veteran of many U.K. takeover battles, has been touted as a possible friendly bidder for all or part of Guinness Peat. Last week, he offered to buy Equiticorp's then-35.6% stake in Guinness Peat for 112 pence a share, said Patrick Keenan, an assistant director at Samuel Montagu. Equiticorp rejected the offer, Mr. Keenan added.    A Maxwell spokesman declined yesterday to elaborate on Mr. Maxwell's latest share purchase or investment plans. But Mr. Goldie-Scot shrugged off the possibility of a takeover threat from the publisher.    Mr. Kerr-Dineen of Guinness Peat said he hadn't talked to Mr. Maxwell about a possible takeover of Guinness Peat. He added that the merchant-banking group still is talking with &quot;one or two&quot; other potential bidders. </TEXT></DOC>
