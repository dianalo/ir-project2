Possible hurdles could include the reluctance of institutionalshareholders to accept the group's all-debt offer for thetobacco-retailing giant, scrutiny by the British government anddefensive litigation in the United States, experts said.   ``An important element is how the government is going to react,''said Philip Healey, editor of the British publication AquisitionsMonthly. ``Is it good for the U.K. industry? What benefits will comeout of it besides making three rich men richer?''   BAT stock fell the equivalent of 37 cents a share to close at$14.21 Wednesday on the London Stock Exchange, following a$3.24-a-share runup Tuesday.   The stock remained above the Goldsmith group's offer of $13.77 ashare in debt securities, indicating speculation that a higher offermight emerge.   In the United States, American Depositary Receipts representingshares of BAT closed at $14.12{, down from $14.37{ Tuesday on theAmerican Stock Exchange.   A sweeter offer may rival the record $25 billion purchase of RJRNabisco Inc., completed earlier this year by the New York investmentfirm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.   BAT's board of directors met Wednesday and afterward reaffirmedin a statement that it regarded the offer as unwelcome.   The Anglo-French financier Goldsmith, joined by British merchantbanker Jacob Rothschild and Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer,launched the bid Tuesday morning through a newly formed company,Hoylake Investments PLC.   The group said it intended to break up BAT _ the world's biggesttobacco company _ by selling its non-tobacco interests, whichinclude financial services, retailing and papermaking.   Analysts said the bidders could encounter trouble winning overBritish institutional investors, who have been hostile toward highlyleveraged offers, or those relying on debt rather than cash orstock. The bid would require a better price and some cash tosucceed, analysts said, adding they believed Goldsmith's offer wasonly an opening shot.   The takeover also may face an investigation by the Monopolies andMergers Commission on public interest grounds. Although PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government championsfree-market policies, it has blocked takeovers in the past.   The government, for example, in March blocked the acquisition ofbrewer Scottish and Newcastle PLC by the Australian company EldersIXL, citing the public interest.   For the same reason, the government last year ordered Kuwait tomore than halve its 22 percent stake in British Petroleum Co. PLC.BP subsequently bought the entire holding.   The offer for BAT also might face legal action in the UnitedStates, where BAT has extensive interests, including Brown andamp;Williamson Tobacco Corp., Farmers Insurance Group Inc. and the SaksFifth Avenue and Marshall Field's department stores.   Earlier this year, South African-controlled Minorco SA's hostilebid for the British mining giant Consolidated Gold Fields PLC ranaground in a U.S. court. A New York federal judge, citing antitrustconcerns, issued a temporary restraining order against that bid,which then expired under British takeover rules.   Gold Fields since has agreed to be taken over by Britishconglomerate Hanson PLC.   There was some speculation that BAT's management might try aleveraged buyout, but analysts said the obvious choices forengineers for such a big deal have their hands quite full.   In a leveraged buyout, a bidder uses borrowed money to take overa target and then uses the target's earnings or sells off its piecesto pay off the debt.   Kohlberg Kravis, the acknowledged leveraged buyout king, is stilldealing with RJR Nabisco and Wasserstein Perella and Co., anotherNew York buyout firm, is involved in an offer for Gateway Corp., aBritish supermarket operator.</TEXT></DOC>
