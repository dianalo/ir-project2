<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-53-1033 </DOCNO><TEXT>The research project for designing and constructing a salt-gradient solarpond within the State of Arizona was requested by the Arizona Solar EnergyCommission during a period when an oil embargo was still a possibility.The project was built at the Gray Mountain Maintenance Camp of the ArizonaDepartment of Transportation, approximately 50 miles north of Flagstaffon Highway 89. The purpose of the study was to develop a reasonably low-costmethod of generating useful thermal energy from a reusable resource.The solar pond has offered that potential. The salt-gradient solar pondis a body of water characterized by unique conditions which enable itto gather and store heat from the sun. The hot solar pond has been usedfor heating a maintenance building through a heat extraction process.The design of this facility was planned to provide a number of uniquedesign and construction criteria described in the report. It is anticipatedthat the solar pond concept may become a viable alternative source ofenergy if the installation cost can be brought down to approximately$2.00 per square foot. The production of energy from such a facilityis also dependent upon the quality of routine maintenance and other factorsdescribed in the report.</TEXT></DOC>
