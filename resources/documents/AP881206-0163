And the fact that global average temperatures have droppedsharply in the second half of 1988 should not be taken as evidencethat the world is cooling off or not warming up, he and a colleagueagreed.   ``The greenhouse effect is not at all a controversial subject''among scientists, said Stephen Schneider of the National Center forAtmospheric Research at Boulder, Colo., in a speech to a conferencesponsored by the non-profit Climate Institute.   The warming, the result of a build-up of heat-trapping gases inthe atmosphere that act like the transparent glass ceiling of agreenhouse, would result in rising sea levels, stronger hurricanes,drastic shifts in rainfall, the northward migration of agriculturalzones and more frequent droughts, according to computer models.   One widely accepted prediction says the warming will amount toabout three to eight degrees Fahrenheit by sometime in the middle ofnext century.   James Hansen, a climatologist at the Goddard Institute of SpaceSciences, a New York City-based arm of the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration, said a sharp cooling of the southern PacificOcean probably will mean the 1988 average global temperature willnot set a record, but will match or be slightly below the twowarmest years on record, 1981 and 1987, which were virtual ties.   ``If you want to see if there's a greenhouse effect, you don'tlook just at 1988 or 1984 or any particular year, but the entire1980s,'' Hansen said at a news conference.   Even if 1988 does not set a record, it will still be one of thefive warmest years known to history _ all in the 1980s.   Some experts have said the cooling in the southern Pacific couldpresage a 30-year cooling trend. Schneider said he sees nothing tosupport such a prediction.   The chief gas responsible for the greenhouse effect is carbondioxide produced by the burning of fossil fuels. Concentrations inthe atmosphere have risen 25 percent in the past 200 years and morethan 10 percent in the past 30 years.   Some industrial spokesmen and government officials have arguedthat the warming that scientists like Schneider have predicted isonly a theory that hasn't been proven.   But Schneider defended the accuracy of computer models, and saidthe only unsolved questions are how much warmer the Earth willbecome and ``whether it's going to happen in 50 or 100 years.''   Schneider said, ``To people who say it's only a theory, I like tosay, `OK, gravity is only a theory. Please stick your neck in theguillotine and let's conduct today's experiment.'''   He urged support for energy conservation and other measures hesaid would be ``already justified ... even if the entire problemturns out to be fake.''   Hansen attracted wide attention with Senate testimony in Julythat the greenhouse warming had begun, though he cautioned that lastsummer's heat wave in the United States could be normal climatevariation. At the time, he said there was a possibility 1988 couldbe the warmest year in history.</TEXT></DOC>
