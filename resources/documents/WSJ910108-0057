Both FDIC Chairman William Seidman and Comptrollerof the Currency Robert Clarke have expressed the need tobring more capital into New England, where the economy andbanks are being racked by a real-estate recession.</LP><TEXT>   FDIC officials said that other bidders have begun toexpress interest in acquiring Boston-based Bank of NewEngland, the holding company's former core bank with assetsof $13.2 billion, the $7.7 billion Connecticut Bank andamp; TrustCo., and the $1.1 billion Maine National Bank.   Bank of New England Corp., the holding company for thesubsidiary banks under FDIC control, filed for reliefyesterday under Chapter 7 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. Thefiling under Chapter 7, which governs liquidationproceedings, won't affect the FDIC's management of the bank'ssubsidiaries. Currently, the holding company has about $50million in assets, according to a bank official, $20 millionof which is in cash and the rest in investments. Those assetswill be sought by various creditors, including holders of$706 million in debentures of Bank of New England Corp.   Acquiring Bank of New England would be a major move foreither San Francisco-based BankAmerica, the nation'ssecond-largest bank holding company, or Banc One of Columbus,Ohio, the 15th-largest, which have worked aggressively tobuild commanding positions in their markets.   Recently, John McCoy, Banc One chairman, said he wasinterested in expansion into New England. Purchasing Bank ofNew England Corp. would boost Banc One's assets by about 50%.   A bid by BankAmerica would escalate its already aggressiveefforts to expand outside its huge California base. Duringthe past year, BankAmerica has acquired about a half-dozenout-of-state banks and thrifts.   Buying the New England banks would suggest thatBankAmerica wants &quot;nationwide branch banking, and the lowercost of delivery that goes with that,&quot; said David Crowley, abank analyst for Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc.   FDIC officials said that prospective purchasers will takeabout a month to complete &quot;due diligence&quot; investigations ofthe failed banks' loan portfolios to determine a bid. BothBankAmerica and Banc One have an edge because they approachedBank of New England about a possible purchase beforeChristmas. Still, it could take several months for these orother possible bidders to complete a purchase.   BankAmerica confirmed that it is discussing a possible bidwith the FDIC. If the terms of an agreement are acceptableand the interests of BankAmerica shareholders are protected,&quot;BankAmerica believes a healthy operation could be created,&quot;a company statement said. A Banc One spokesman said thecompany was waiting for financial and bidding informationfrom the FDIC.   Banking analysts said the appeal of purchasing the unitsof New England's third-largest bank holding company is therapid acquisition of market share at a low price. &quot;The mostimportant thing in banking today is depth of market share,&quot;said William Weber of Furash andamp; Co., a bank consulting firm.   The risk of moving into New England now is the unknownlength and depth of the area's recession. Nevertheless,&quot;banking in the U.S. is going to consolidate dramatically,&quot;both because of economic pressures and the growingcongressional talk of changing banking laws, Mr. Weber said.&quot;People are beginning to start bottom fishing&quot; as they try toposition themselves in new markets. Last year, for instance,Banc One acquired MCorp, a failed Texas bank group.   The law requires the FDIC to seek the lowest-costresolution for troubled banks. One question officials mustface is whether the agency should sell Bank of New England'sformer assets as a package to one buyer or sell themseparately. &quot;If they can find somebody to take the wholething, that's certainly easier administratively, but it maybe more expensive&quot; for the FDIC because there could be morebidders for individual parts, Mr. Weber said.   Under federal banking law, the FDIC must give preferenceto a local purchaser, but it isn't clear whether other banksin the region could digest the Bank of New England's formerassets at this time. In the past, Fleet/Norstar FinancialGroup Inc. in Providence, R.I., has been interested inexpansion. In addition, some European banks may bid for allor part of the assets. Last year, Royal Bank of Scotlandpurchased Bank of New England's Rhode Island unit.   The FDIC has put the Bank of New England units intoso-called bridge banks, which existing management will rununder federal supervision while the agency works to arrange asale. The bridge bank arrangement gives the FDIC widelatitude to set terms.   In Texas, the FDIC used bridge banks to arrange Banc One'sacquisition of MCorp and NCNB Corp.'s purchase of FirstRepublic Bancorp's assets, which were greater than Bank ofNew England's. In each case, the acquiring bank intiallybought a share of the bridge bank and agreed to buy theFDIC's interest over time.   A crucial element in determining the price will be thequality of the failed banks' assets and the FDIC'swillingness to protect the purchaser from loss. Based oninformation from Bank of New England, the agency said that $5billion to $6 billion of the insolvent banks' loans arenonperforming or potentially substandard in some way. TheFDIC usually agrees to take over a pool of bad loans,although the acquiring bank may manage them under a feearrangement designed to encourage the most profitablepossible restructuring or disposition of the loans.   The transaction will be closely watched by Congress, whichis worried about the health of the bank deposit-insurancefund and fairness of the FDIC's decision to protect all Bankof New England deposits -- even the $2 billion beyond thelegal boundaries of federal deposit insurance -- while notprotecting all depositors in several recent failures ofsmaller banks, including Freedom National Bank in New York.House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas)has asked regulators to testify tomorrow on the Bank of NewEngland closure.   ---   G.
