(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Evangelist Oral Roberts says his ministryhas been getting increasingly fewer donations over the last twoyears and that he must have $11 million by May 6 or face financialcollapse.   Creditors will ``start dismantling'' his ministry and OralRoberts University if he doesn't get the money, the 71-year-oldevangelist said Monday.   ``If we can't make our payroll, I don't know what will happen tothis man or this ministry,'' Roberts said, his voice sometimesquivering with emotion.   ``People, this is serious. This is a life-and-death matter,'' headded.   The evangelist's plea came two years after he created a furor bysaying his life depended on raising $8 million to providescholarships for medical school students at his college.   ``Two years have passed, and I have been silent,'' Roberts saidduring taping for his weekly television program.   Roberts attributed the decline in donations to scandals in otherministries ``that have disquieted millions of people.''   ``I have never been a part of those scandals,'' Roberts said.   The reference was to Louisiana evangelist Jimmy Swaggart'sreported encounters with a prostitute and to evangelists Jim andTammy Bakker's alleged financial wrongdoing at the PTL Ministry inSouth Carolina.</TEXT></DOC>
