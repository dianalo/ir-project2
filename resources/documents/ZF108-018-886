(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>How Allies Fit With the New IBMandM;When IBM began working with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. to design and operate a $50million advanced network management and control system for the New YorkCity-based brokerage firm, it didn't take long for the computer company tomake some big changes to its Netview network management product.andP;  Thefinancial giant told IBM it needed more automation of the system, and itwanted better support in Netview for non-IBM networks.andP;  &quot;We did not have thatplugged into our plan,&quot; admits Ellen Hancock, an IBM vice president andgeneral manager of the Communication Systems line of business.andP;  &quot;Ourassumption was that the customer in some cases would do it.andP;  [But] we werenow the customer.andP;  So we went in and funded it.&quot;andM;What Hancock's business funded was a series of new alliances with outsidesoftware vendors to provide the functions IBM had not planned for Netview.andO;For example, IBM formed an alliance with International TeleManagement Corp.andO;of Vienna, Va., to allow Netview to support non-Systems Network Architecturenetworks.andP;  (SNA is part of IBM's overall Systems Application Architecture.)andO;Another small company, TSB International Inc. of Toronto was brought in toenhance Netview's automatic alerts and alarms.andM;Those are just two of an unprecedented number of recent IBM investments andpartnerships with customers and with software and service suppliers.andP;  Theyrepresent the second major thrust of IBM's market-driven push, one aimed atincreasing the number and improving the quality of applications and othertools running on IBM systems.andP;  Another goal of these alliances is to at leastcreate the impression that broad industry support is finally forming for SAA,even if IBM has to buy it.andM;Having been bitten hard by disastrous acquisitions such as Rolm Corp., atelephone switch maker that cost the company billions of dollars before beingpartly sold off to Siemens AG, IBM has decided that less is best.andP;  Now buyingminority, although usually dominant, positions in companies, IBM's U.S.andO;equity investments already exceed a dozen in number and $200 million invalue, according to Wall Street estimates.andP;  The investments fall into twocategories: those that provide IBM with access to newer, developingtechnologies and those with established companies having expertise inspecific industries.andP;  All of these companies are generally tried and Blue,having previously established remarketing or development relationships withIBM or, at the very least, having been committed to providing products usingIBM hardware.andM;The list of known IBM investments in the United States includes suchheavyweights as Management Science America Inc. of Atlanta; Policy ManagementSystems Corp. of Columbia, S.C.; and American Management Systems Inc. ofArlington, Va., as well as several small start-ups developing image andcomputer-aided software engineering (CASE) technology.andP;  Furthermore, thiswave of spending has spread beyond the North American shores to Europe, whereat least 13 investments have been made.andM;Other types of deals include a 50/50 partnership establishing a health careinformation management company with Baxter Healthcare Corp. in Deerfield,Ill., and joint development projects with customers such as the SanAntonio-based insurer United Services Automobile Association (USAA).andP;  Andoutright acquisitions still are not entirely out of the question for IBM--aslong as they're small.andP;  The company six weeks ago, for instance, agreed tobuy Cadam Inc., a subsidiary of Lockheed Corp. that specializes incomputer-aided design and manufacturing software, for an estimated $80million.andM;Why IBM Seeks Architectural SupportandM;Clearly, IBM has taken a close look at the classic make-versus-buy decisionand has come to the conclusion that it cannot make it all.andP;  Given its ratherlackluster image in the applications software market, this decision to investsits well with some customers.andP;  &quot;In the past, IBM provided tools with whichyou were supposed to solve your problems,&quot; says Jack Hancock, systemstechnology vice president for Pacific Bell Co.andP;  &quot;Things are a lot morecomplicated today, and tools don't solve problems.&quot;andM;Others are more cynical.andP;  &quot;IBM won't go into a joint venture unless itbenefits IBM, but it may not benefit me as a customer,&quot; says Don Bookwalter,vice president of systems and programming for Bank of the West in SantaClara.andP;  Still, he adds, &quot;Some software is very technical, very specific toyour line of business.andP;  While IBM has people who know banking, some peoplewho don't work at IBM know banking better.&quot;andM;Maybe the most easily accepted explanation for these deals is that IBM isgaining much-needed software and industry expertise that it can't or won'tdevelop in house.andP;  But other reasons exist, as well.andP;  Most basic may be theneed for IBM to guarantee that software developers create applications forSAA--IBM's framework for developing consistent applications across its majorcomputing environments.andM;There is practically no downside risk in these deals for IBM, says BernardGoldstein, partner at Fort Lee, N.J.-based Broadview Associates.andP;  Still,Goldstein believes the alliances are proof that IBM's world is changing.andO;&quot;Software developers are increasingly hardware independent,&quot; he says, &quot;sowhat IBM used to get for free through market dominance it now seeks to buy.&quot;andO;Adds Bruce Hadburg, an analyst with Input Inc., a market research firm inMountain View, Calif.: &quot;SAA is costing more than software vendors or IBManticipated.&quot;andM;The cost of building a system for the architecture, which debuted in 1987, isindeed high, agrees Brian Cohen, vice president of technology and research atMSA.andP;  The $250 million MSA had sufficient resources and commitment to SAAbefore IBM invested in the company, Cohen says.andP;  But the same cannot be saidof all the software firms that IBM has staked.andP;  &quot;Some of the smaller companyinvestments are geared to giving them seed money to do it [SAA]successfully,&quot; he says.andP;  Making existing software comply with SAA is not justa conversion process, he explains; it often requires that a companycompletely rearchitect its product.andM;Aggressive funding of SAA has helped IBM less directly, as well.andP;  If SAAhadn't moved along at a quicker clip in 1989, MSA, for one, would havedevoted resources to Digital Equipment Corp. offerings instead.andM;But not all the money IBM is spending on these partnerships is being used tobuy support for SAA.andP;  And IBM is not the only one to benefit.andP;  Arnold Kraft,chief executive officer of Bachman Information Systems Inc., says the cashthat IBM has invested in the Cambridge, Mass., CASE supplier will allowBachman to accelerate development of products for OS/2 Extended Edition, theoperating system for IBM's PS/2 line of desktop systems, although Kraft won'tgive a timetable.andM;Likewise, Image Business Systems Corp. of New York City has found that it isfree to do other important things now that IBM has invested in andsubsequently taken over all maintenance of its products.andP;  &quot;We are certainlydeveloping software more intensely than before,&quot; says David Sarna, IBS chiefexecutive officer.andP;  But, it can be argued, some of that money is being spentto keep important players from siding with the competition.andM;However, this intensity of activity surrounding SAA does not inspireeveryone.andP;  &quot;The people IBM bought into will declare SAA support,&quot; says BillWillard, IS vice president for Standard Insurance of Portland, Ore.andP;  &quot;From mystandpoint, I've chosen not to participate in SAA.&quot;andP;  For Willard, opensystems are the wave of the future.andP;  His company is investing in UNIX-basedopen systems supplied by ATandamp;T.andM;Although the goal behind some of these deals may be good old domination, theway they're being made reflects the new IBM organization.andP;  While mostinvestments still need the approval of top IBM executives, the ponderousstyle typical of a large company barely exists.andP;  In the case of Computer TaskGroup Inc., for example, it took only seven weeks from the time IBM initiateddiscussions with the Buffalo, N.Y., professional services firm until the dealwas signed to purchase 15.3% of the company for $21 million, according to CTGchairman David Campbell.andM;Apparently, IBM top management has given the green light for investments, andthe idea is being taken up vigorously by others.andP;  &quot;It's like when you seesomeone who'd decided to break up a marriage,&quot; says Campbell.andP;  &quot;He then goesout with 10 women in a month.&quot;andM;IBM currently is in the process of going through each of its industrysolution areas to decide how better to align itself with partners, says NedLautenbach, an IBM vice president and general manager of the ApplicationsSolutions Division of the U.S.andP;  Marketing and Services LOB.andP;  There is abudget for investments that fall in the applications area, and these budgetsare gone over by a new Alliance Council headed by Lautenbach.andP;  A group of IBMexecutives make up the council, whose job it is to approve investments,development contracts and other initiatives set forth by other IBM managers.andM;SAA, the Tie That BindsandM;Once the deals are signed, IBM seems to create synergy where it can.andP;  Forexample, after Bank South NA of Atlanta awarded IBM a 10-year contract totake over the operation of its data center, IBM called in CTG to do some ofthe work and suggested to Image Business Systems that it let CTG install itsproducts across the country.andM;IBM officials insist that support among independent software vendors for SAAsuggests that the architecture is on its way toward acceptance.andP;  This istrue, they maintain, despite charges that IBM continues to give in tomarketplace pressures by adding languages such as PL/1 and products such asits customer information control system (CICS) to SAA, and despite theobvious fact that SAA remains fundamentally a proprietary, IBM platform-basedenvironment.andP;  &quot;I believe the world inside and outside IBM believes in what weare doing,&quot; says Earl F. Wheeler, the keeper of the SAA flame.andP;  Wheeler is anIBM vice president and general manager of its Programming Systems LOB.andM;By carrying out its SAA plans and introducing cross-functional products ontop of the architecture, such as the Office Vision and A/D Cycleenvironments, IBM has been able to convince ISVs that SAA represents anopportunity.andP;  Before Big Blue published its SAA blueprint in 1987, ISVs werehaving difficulty making money selling software for IBM machines.andP;  That's&quot;because we were thinking of the system as the instruction set and not asthis [higher level] interface,&quot; Wheeler explains.andP;  Writing to key SAAinterfaces such as common user access (CUA) gives ISVs the opportunity tosell their software to users of all major IBM computers, from PS/2s to 3090mainframes.andM;Even ISVs selling products that clearly compete with IBM software havestarted jumping on the SAA bandwagon.andP;  Information Builders Inc., forexample, will run its fourth-generation language Focus products in IBM'sAD/Cycle and OfficeVision environments, even though the Focus products willcompete there with IBM's own Cross System Product application generator.andO;&quot;With those folks we will be competing in the marketplace.andP;  And we will tryto win,&quot; Wheeler says.andP;  &quot;But if we lose, it's nice that their customers arealso our customers.&quot;andM;Cooperative ProcessingandM;Some customers, too, are beginning to see an economic justification for SAA.andO;At the New York City-based insurance giant Metropolitan Life andamp; AffiliatedCos., for example, IS executives had tended to restrict ambitiouscooperative-processing implementations to applications where the potentialfor strategic advantage was clear.andP;  The reason: it cost too much to buildsuch applications from scratch.andP;  But, says Paul Ratner, a Met Life ISmanager, SAA offers the chance to build such applications much lessexpensively, without relying on internally developed custom code andprotocol.andP;  Ratner says Met Life is happy to give up access to low-level IBMsystem software code if the tradeoff is high-function, less-expensivecooperative-processing applications.andM;IBM has made gains pitching SAA to customers because the company has begunfocusing on cooperative processing and the business case for SAA, saysRatner.andP;  &quot;IBM has historically been unable to explain SAA adequately to theCIO,&quot; the Met Life manager says.andP;  &quot;That's because portability was the [IBM]focus.andP;  But that was missing the point for most people.&quot;andP;  The insurancecompany now is planning several SAA cooperative-processing applications, someof which will go into production later this year.andM;But even some IBM partners aren't completely happy with SAA's recentdirection.andP;  Some fear that IBM may be compromising SAA's long-term integrityin its effort to give the architecture market momentum.andP;  Last year, forexample, IBM announced a product development and licensing agreement withInteractive Images Inc. of Woburn, Mass., to port that company's Easelgraphical user interface development tool to OS/2 Extended Edition.andP;  Morerecently, IBM has stated that Easel will be its preferred tool for developingCUA-compliant graphical user interfaces under OS/2EE.andP;  Wheeler said IBMdoesn't expect customers to use its own Dialog Manager product or to writedirectly to Presentation Manager in developing graphical user interfaces.andM;The concern among some of IBM's software partners is that users may use Easelas a front-end tool but stop short of making the back end of theirapplications SAA compliant.andP;  Doing so, they fear, might rob SAA of one of itschief benefits--the ability to provide a consistent interface for applicationprogrammers at the back end of programs.andP;  &quot;This is what I call theEaselization of SAA,&quot; says John Tibbetts, director of technology at TesseractCorp. of San Francisco, an OfficeVision partner.andP;  &quot;It's a tactical decisionon IBM's part to get people to CUA, but it doesn't help them to take the nextstep, to take the strategic shift to SAA.&quot;andM;Wheeler answers that most users aren't ready to make that shift and that, formost, Presentation Manager is too difficult to write to directly.andP;  For itspart, Microsoft Inc., which codeveloped OS/2 with IBM, does believe thatpeople will use Presentation Manager, its graphical user interface, to writeOS/2 applications.andP;  That's because it sees its chief customers as softwarevendors, not end users.andM;While some may be concerned with IBM's long-term approach to SAA, thecompany's success to date in luring ISVs to SAA and in becoming more marketdriven raises some problems for competitors such as Digital.andP;  The Maynard,Mass.-based computer maker has responded with its own attempt to become moremarket driven, creating complex, industry-specialized bid organizations.andO;Digital has also attempted to extend its own architecture with an integratedCASE environment to attract ISVs.andM;Digital admits, however, that IBM's momentum is attracting ISVs to SAA.andO;Moreover, Big Blue's willingness to spend money to do so worries the No.andP;  2computer maker.andP;  &quot;We're concerned about it because we, of course, would likean even playing field where our products are treated the same or even morefavorably than IBM's in terms of developing new applications or portingsoftware from one platform to another,&quot; says Bill Steul, Digital's corporatesystems group vice president.andP;  &quot;We think it ought to be a fair process.andP;  Andwe don't think that anybody in the industry wants one company to get theadvantage over everybody else.&quot;andM;While Digital may be concerned about IBM's newest ventures, the softwareindustry seems to be less concerned with challenging SAA than with learningto live with it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
