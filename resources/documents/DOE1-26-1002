<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-26-1002 </DOCNO><TEXT>The simulated AM1 efficiency of evaporated CulnSe/sub 2//CdZnS polychrystallinethin-film solar cells prepared in a production oriented, monolithicallyinterconnected submodule configuration of 91 cm/sup 2/ area on low-costglass substrates has been increased from 6.2% to 9.6%. The results havebeen attributed to the formation of co-evaporated selenide films withimproved compositional and structural uniformities. Submodule structuresand fabrication processes including electron gun evaporation of the mixedCdZnS films will be presented along with the submodule photovoltaic performances.The preparation of silicon oxide and nitride optical thin-films by aplasma enhanced CVD process and the application of these films as a quarterwavelength double-layer ARC is also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
