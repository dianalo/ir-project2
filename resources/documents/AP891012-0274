But they are unable to do so,'' the Center on Budget andPolicy Priorities said in a report released Wednesday.   The substantially higher poverty rates among rural working poorwere found among both whites and blacks, as well as full-time andpart-time workers, the report said.   In 1987, the most recent year for which data was available, theoverall poverty rate in families in which the household head worksat least part time was 10 percent in rural areas, compared with 5.7percent in metropolitan areas.   For blacks, the rural poverty rate was 27.8 percent, comparedwith 15.5 percent in metropolitan areas. Among white families, thepoverty rate was 8.5 percent in rural areas, compared with 4.5percent in metropolitan areas.   The 1987 poverty line defined by the federal government was anannual income of $11,611 for a family of four.   The report said there were significantly higher poverty rates inrural areas even though ``a substantial majority of thenon-metropolitan poor live in a household with at least oneworker.''   About 9.1 million Americans in rural areas lived in poverty in1987, the study said. Of those, an estimate 5.8 million lived in ahousehold where at least one household member worked during theyear.   In 1987, said the report, 70.5 percent of the heads of ruralpoor families who were not ill, disabled or retired were people whoworked for all or part of the year, with 24.3 percent working fulltime year-round.   ``The poverty rate among workers in non-metro areas rose sharplyduring the back-to-back recessions of the early 1980s and declineduring the ensuing economic recovery,'' the report said. ``Despitethe lengthy recovery, however, poverty rates among non-metroworkers are higher now than they were during the recovery of thelate 1970s.''   One reason rural job growth has lagged behind job growth inmetropolitan areas is that non-metro area employment is moreconcentrated in industries that are experiencing decline, thereport said.   ``In particular, non-metro unemployment is more concentrated intwo areas _ resource industries (mining and agriculture) androutine manufacturing _ that have encountered substantial problemsin the 1980s.''   The Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Prioritiesdescribes itself as a non-partisan, non-profit researchorganization that studies government spending and the programs andpolicy issues that have an impact on low-income Americans.</TEXT></DOC>
