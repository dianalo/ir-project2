A feasibility study of the potential projects is being conductedunder authority of a U.S. House of Representatives Committee on PublicWorks and Transportation resolution; adopted October 1, 1986. The Commonwealthof Pennsylvania, City of Scranton, and Borough of Olyphant are the non-Federalsponsors for the feasibility phase of the LFP project.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Questions about the proposed actionand DEIS can be answered by Mr. Steven Stegner, Project Manager, BaltimoreDistrict, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: CENAB-PL-PR, P.O.

The Lackawanna River, a tributary of the Susquehanna River, is locatedin northeastern Pennsylvania. The 346 square mile drainage basin lies mostlyin Lackawanna County, with the river bisecting the City of Scranton. TheLackawanna River valley has experienced flooding for many years. Floodingin September 1985 resulted in a Presidental disaster declaration for thearea and, most recently, floods caused serious damages throughout the valleyin March 1986.2. A variety of remedial measures and flood control structures are beingconsidered along the Lackawanna River. Possible solutions in Scranton thatare being investigated include 19,000 feet of channel improvement (dredgingand/or realignment), 17,200 feet of levee, and 1,400 feet of flood wall.In Olyphant, proposed solutions include approximately 5,500 feet of levee,300 feet of flood wall, and the dredging of 5,000 feet of river channel.Note that these solutions may be combined to form a variety of alternativeproposals which will be evaluted for selection during the feasibility phaseof the LFP project. Projects at both locations may also include featuressuch as access ramps (for channel maintenance), interior drainage facilities(for levees), and closure structures. Acquisition of residential and businessproperties, and the relocation of public utilities are among actions thatmay be required as part of the project. Sediment and debris removed fromproject areas would be deposited in suitable upland disposal sites.3. The Baltimore District is preparing a Draft Environmental Impact Statement(DEIS) which will describe the impacts of the proposed projects on environmentaland cultural resources in the study area and the overall public interest.The DEIS will also apply guidelines issued by the Environmental ProtectionAgency, under authority of section 404 (b)(1) of the Clean Water Act of1977 (Pub. L. 95-217).4. The public involvement program will include meetings and close coordinationwith interested private individuals and organizations, as well as concernedlocal, state, and Federal agencies. A public notice requesting commenton the proposed project and DEIS will be provided to appropriate agenciesand the public through the printed media and mailings. A scoping meetingis not planned at this time. The Baltimore District invites potentiallyaffected Federal, state, and local agencies, and other interested organizationsand parties to participate in this study. Agencies that are currently involvedin the feasibility study and EIS process include, but are not limited to,the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,U.S. Geological Service, U.S. Soil Conservation Service, National ParkService, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, PennsylvaniaHistorical and Museum Commission, Susquehanna River Basin Commission, LackawannaCounty Regional Planning Commission, and Lackawanna River Corridor Association.5. The DEIS is scheduled to be available for public review in September1990.<ITAG tagnum="6">Bernard E.
