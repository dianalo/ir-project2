Leaders of the Palestinian uprising called for attacks on Arabsworking for the Israeli government. Hospital officials said troopsshot and wounded two people, including a 9-year-old girl, whodefied curfews Friday in the West Bank.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, 18-year-old Muhamad Barash, of theBureij refugee camp, was shot in the abdomen and listed in``dangerous'' condition at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital, an Arabreporter said. The bullet penetrated his kidney, a hospitalofficial said.   About 30 other Bureij residents complained they were beaten whenthe army conducted house-to-house searches during the night, saidthe reporter, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Most weretreated at a local clinic but a 13-year-old was hospitalized, hesaid.   Bureij had been under curfew for two days when the restrictionwas lifted Friday night. The Arab reporter said as soon as thecurfew ended, youths streamed into the streets to hurl rocks atsoldiers.   A military spokesman said he knew only that there were riots inGaza. He did not confirm the shootings.   The army maintained a curfew on the West Bank's largest city,Nablus.   The latest leaflet issued this week by the undergroundleadership of the Palestinian uprising threatened reprisals againstArabs in Israeli-appointed positions.   ``Striking forces will direct blows against those who refuse toresign from their posts on August 27,'' it said.   The call for such resignations has been a consistent onethroughout the more than 8-month-old revolt, and hundreds ofPalestinian policemen have resigned their posts.   Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel have beenthe targets of violence by other Palestinians. In the latest case,masked men hacked a suspected collaborator to death Thursday in theWest Bank.   Israel's Minister of Economics and Planning, Gad Ya'acobi, saidthe intefadeh, Arabic for ``uprising,'' is costing Israel $1.7million a day, the Itim news agency said. The report gave nofurther details.   It was not the first time Ya'acobi, of the left-leaning Laborparty, pointed a finger at the uprising to explain recent Israelieconomic ills. He said Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 alsowreaked havoc on the economy, Itim said.   Since it began Dec. 8, the Palestinian revolt against Israel'soccupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip _ seized from Jordan andEgypt in 1967 _ has claimed 254 Arab lives. Four Israelis have died.   Minister-without-portfolio Moshe Arens, of the right-wing Likudparty, called for talks with residents of the occupied territoriesafter allowing them to hold free elections to chooserepresentatives.   Speaking on Israel's Arabic television service, he said hedoubted PLO figures would be elected if truly free elections wereto be held in the territories.   Polls however indicate most Palestinians regard the PalestineLiberation Organization as their sole legitimate representativebody.   Using the Israeli biblical names for the West Bank, Arens said,``We know that in Judea and Samaria today, there are a whole hostof terrorist organizations; there are attempts to frighten people;there are attempts to force the PLO's will on people.''   In Nablus on Friday, a hospital official who spoke on conditionof anonymity said a 9-year-old girl was shot in the leg when sheran out of her house in defiance of curfew.   An Arab reporter said the girl mistook an army loudspeakerannouncement extending the curfew for the type of announcementnormally made to broadcast the end of confinement.   A 23-year-old resident was also shot in the leg, but thecircumstances were unclear, an Arab reporter said.   Nablus has been under curfew for two days.   A military spokesman said she had no knowledge of the shootings,but she did not deny the report.</TEXT></DOC>
