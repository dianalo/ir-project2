Proper engineering and job design can greatly reduce fetal risks, but employers routinely opt for less complex and less expensive ways of coping -- most often transferring workers away from their jobs or, in effect, forcing them to quit.    Possible reproductive risks associated with video display terminals have merited considerable international attention because so many VDTs are in use: In the U.S., approximately 15 million workers operate VDTs daily. Further, scientific research -- though inconclusive -- suggests that VDTs may cause fetal abnormalities, and there is very little you can tell a pregnant woman who is concerned about VDT exposure but who cannot afford to lose her job. If my wife were pregnant, I would certainly discourage her from working at a computer if possible.    As for the epidemiological study of VDTs and reproductive risks that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is doing, that agency has dragged its feet for so long on this project -- plans were first announced in 1982 -- that the costly study will be of little or no value when it is completed.    Mark A. Pinsky   Director, Public Affairs   New York Committee for   Occupational Safety and Health    New York   ---   BellSouth Corp. has been voluntarily participating since 1983 in a study proposed by NIOSH on the possible risks to women's reproductive health from exposure to VDTs. BellSouth is one of only two companies participating.    Your article states that BellSouth &quot;won't let researchers ask workers about their fertility history or their perception of occupational stress.&quot; In fact, the Office of Management and Budget, which controls funding for the study, made the decision to delete those questions. BellSouth does not have the authority to make NIOSH delete questions from any of its studies.    You also stated that BellSouth &quot;sought the help&quot; of OMB, &quot;which then threatened to block funding for the study unless the questions were dropped.&quot;    As a participant in the study, we were asked our assessment of the proposal by NIOSH. Lacking expertise in this field, we consulted with epidemiologists from the Harvard School of Public Health.    We submitted our assessment and those from Harvard to OMB as part of the process OMB follows in making funding decisions. After review, OMB directed NIOSH to delete the stress and fertility questions, along with other modifications, as part of the conditions for funding the study.    While there is some difference of opinion on whether the stress and fertility questions would enhance or detract from the scientific validity of the results, BellSouth wants to see the study go forward because the health and safety of our employees is our highest priority. From the outset, our objective has been to work with NIOSH to ensure a valid study.    Regardless of whether the decision is made to reinstate these questions, BellSouth will cooperate fully with NIOSH.    Roy B. Howard   Director-Industrial Relations   BellSouth Corp.
