A twoflux radiation model was developed to describe radiation within the ceramic,and it was checked and validated against accurate literature results.Based on it, a coupled radiation/conduction model of a ceramic was developed,and it was used in conjunction with time-dependent boundary conditionsdescribing gas-phase heat transfer arising in a heavy duty truck engineoperating at its rated point. The model was applied to limiting casesof fully opaque and full transparent materials, and also in a parametricstudy covering a wide range of ceramic radiative properties encompassingthe range of such properties considered possible for heat barrier ceramics.The material thickness and conductivity were varied as well. The resultsshowed that translucence can have significant detrimental effects onheat barrier effectiveness under realistic diesel engine conditions.The most important properties are the absorption and scattering coefficientsof the ceramics. As these become less opaque, the total heat flux throughthe ceramic layer increases. For low conductivity ceramics this increasecan amount to 50% and more. Significant effects begin to be felt forabsorption coefficients smaller than 10,000 m{sup -1} and scatteringcoefficients smaller than 20,000 m{sup -1}. An important parameter isalso the heat barrier thermal conductance, i.e., the ratio of thermalconductivity to the layer thickness. It is recommended that radiativeproperties be among the properties that are measured and reported forceramic materials. If a particular ceramic is found too translucent,some tailoring of its radiative properties, e.g., by additives, shouldbe considered. 20 refs., 37 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
