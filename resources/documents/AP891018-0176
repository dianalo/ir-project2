At the same time, it said, lack of adequate pay remains the mostcommonly cited reason why members of the Senior Executive Servicedecide to leave government work.   The board released the results of a questionnaire survey of 956senior executives who left government over a 5{ year period endingJune 30, 1988.   The ceiling on Senior Executive Service salaries _ currently$80,700 a year _ was among reasons for leaving given by 57 percentof those responding to the survey, according to a summary of thefindings.   It said the average private-sector salary of former seniorexecutives who continued to work, either part time or full time,was $101,152.   But the report said non-monetary reasons also were frequentlycited by the executives who decided to leave government. Among them:   _48 percent left, in part, because they believe the SES is notbeing administered in a fashion which protects senior executivesfrom improper political interference;   _46 percent left, in part, because they no longer enjoyed theirjobs;   _42 percent left, in part, because their knowledge and skillshad not been used appropriately; and   _38 percent left, in part, because of the incompetence of theirimmediate supervisors.   The board's report noted that ``agencies expend considerableeffort in selecting the most qualified candidates for careerpositions in the Senior Executive Service. They should expend moreeffort in attempting to retain them.''   ``Agencies cannot force the political process to establishadequate SES compensation,'' it said. ``Nor can agencies preventexecutives who have earned the right to retire from doing so.However, agencies can work to reduce SES turnover by attempting toalleviate non-monetary causes of SES dissatisfaction.''   The Merit Systems Protection Board is an independent,quasi-judicial agency with responsibility for deciding federalemployee appeals from personnel actions taken against them.   As a part of its mission, the board is responsible forconducting studies of the civil service and other merit systems andfor reviewing actions of the Office of Personnel Management.</TEXT></DOC>
