The settlement, which is expected to be announced this morning, is related to charges filed Sept. 30 by California Attorney General John Van de Kamp, alleging that tobacco manufacturers and retailers had failed to comply with a stiff new state environmental law. The attorney general's office confirmed that a settlement had been reached.    The state-court lawsuit alleged a failure to post adequate warnings about the level of carcinogens in cigars, pipe tobacco and loose tobacco used for roll-your-own cigarettes. The action was the first major enforcement effort under a recent voter initiative that requires &quot;clear and reasonable warning&quot; about products that the state has found to contain carcinogens above certain levels.    The tobacco and grocery concerns couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
