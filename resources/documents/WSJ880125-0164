The Cigarette Exporters Association, consisting of several large U.S. tobacco manufacturing and exporting companies, filed the complaint with U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. He will have 45 days to determine whether to initiate a formal investigation that could lead to U.S. trade actions against imports from South Korea.    The U.S. industry group said South Korea's cigarette market totals about $2.1 billion a year at the retail level, but sales of U.S.-manufactured cigarettes in that country amounted to only about $1.3 million in 1987.    U.S. trade officials have been negotiating for some time with the South Korean government for an easing of that country's restrictions on imports of cigarettes, beef and other products and its curbs on U.S. insurance companies. </TEXT></DOC>
