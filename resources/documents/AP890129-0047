Husseini, who met in jail recently with Israeli governmentofficials, predicted progress in the next few months towardresolving the conflict, but he refused to elaborate.   He told reporters he believes the Palestine LiberationOrganization will support a U.N.-backed referendum on statehood forthe occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, but not elections for localrepresentatives as suggested by some Israeli leaders.   Husseini, 48, is considered the most powerful pro-PLO leader inthe occupied lands.   In the occupied territories, meanwhile, hospital officialsreported 12 Palestinians were wounded by Israeli soldiers who firedat stone-throwing youths Sunday. The army confirmed six casualties.   It said troops in the Gaza Strip sealed the homes of sixPalestinians accused of attacking soldiers and Arabs suspected ofcollaborating with Israel. In the West Bank town of Tulkarem, troopsdetained about 70 Arabs suspected of rioting, Israel army radio said.   In the West Bank's largest city, Nablus, leaflets appeared forthe first time signed by the Arab Socialist Baath Party, the partyof President Hafez Assad in Syria, Arab reporters said.   The leaflets condemned U.S. imperialism and said Palestinians whofavor elections are playing into Israel's hands. ``The only languagethat the enemy understands is the thug's language,'' they said.   Later Sunday, the Defense Ministry said Husseini met last week inhis prison cell with Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's top adviser,Shmuel Goren, and discussed the occupied territories. Israel radioreported Rabin briefed the Cabinet on the talks.   Husseini refused to directly confirm the meeting but said ``Iprefer if Mr. Goren speaks first.''   Husseini denied Israeli media reports that he would serve as anintermediary between Israel and the PLO.   ``I don't know why they need an intermediary,'' he said. ``Whatis the difference if Faisal Husseini is a messenger or they havedirect contacts?''   Husseini noted that Israelis, even some in the government, aremore open to the Palestinian guerrilla movement since PLO leaderYasser Arafat recognized Israel and renounced terrorism.   ``Some of the Israelis in the high levels of the government aregoing in a new way which I believe is in the right direction,'' hetold Israel radio, taking the unusual step of speaking Hebrew.   Cabinet Minister Ezer Weizmann said Friday that Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir should end the ban on talking to the PLO. On Sunday,Israel radio quoted Shamir as saying that Israel is ready tonegotiate with Palestinians but not the PLO.   Shamir also has called Rabin's recent suggestion on elections anunofficial proposal and said the government still is formulating itspeace initiative.   Rabin plans to hold further meetings with Palestinians on hisproposal, hoping to shift the focus of attention from the PLO tolocal leaders in the occupied lands, Israel television reported.   Husseini was believed imprisoned to control the uprising. He wasnever tried and said he was not informed of charges against him.   ``They gave me no evidence and said it was all in a secretfile,'' he said.   Also Sunday, Israel agreed to raise the Egyptian flag over thedisputed Taba border area. It was a symbolic concession reflectingIsrael's plans to return the 250-acre beach strip to Egyptian ruleand an attempt to restart talks toward resolving the issue, theForeign Ministry said.</TEXT></DOC>
