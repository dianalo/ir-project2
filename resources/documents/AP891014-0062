Conference sources said the legislators, meeting since Sept. 30,narrowed their problems to the Syrian issue after a 17-memberparliamentary task force approved an amended draft for politicalreforms during an all-night session.   Michel Sassin, an Orthodox Christian deputy who is a member ofthe committee, said the debates have ``reached an advanced stage inthe ... inter-Lebanese conciliation.'' He would not elaborate.   The tentative approval of the first chapter of the ArabLeague-proposed Lebanon peace plan drew ``cautious optimism'' fromthe participants, the sources said, noting that deputies hadreneged on several previous accords after contacts with warlordsand militia chieftains in Beirut.   The Lebanese civil war, which has raged for 14 years, has erodedgovernment authority and allowed militia factions to take controlof the streets. Consent of these factions is necessary for thesuccess of any accord that may be reached in Taif.   One source said: ``They reach a consensus and then get atelephone call from Beirut, and we are back where we started.''   The sources, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity,explained that the second chapter of the peace plan _ which dealswith the necessity of an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon _ had beenapproved by all the participants without exception.   But the deputies remained divided over the third and fourthchapters of the plan _ ``Lebanese sovereignty'' and relations withSyria. The plan was proposed by an Arab committee comprised ofSaudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria.   The Christians are demanding written guarantees for a totalSyrian withdrawal from Lebanon. The Moslems have approved a phasedpullback from the Beirut area to be completed in two years,followed by an evacuation after the conclusion of a Syrian-Lebanesepeace pact.   A hard-line Christian deputy, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said a political reforms accord ``would be ink onpaper'' if no satisfactory solution is reached on the issue ofsovereignty and a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign forces.   Syria has 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab Leaguepeacekeeping mandate.   Once the committee completes its debates the draft four-chapterplan would be submitted to a plenary session for approval.Parliament then will take the document back to Beirut forratification at a session to be held in the Lebanese capital.   The reforms envisaged by the Arab committee are designed toredistribute power betwen Christians and Moslems and prepare forthe later stage of abolishing the sectarian system, in force sinceindependence from France in 1943.   Christians then were considered the majority and given the upperhand in the government, Parliament, army and judiciary. Moslems noware believed to comprise a majority of Lebanon's estimated 4million people.</TEXT></DOC>
