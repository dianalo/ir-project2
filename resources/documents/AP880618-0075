The FBI investigated critics of Reagan administration policiesin Nicaragua in one probe and groups planning or stagingdemonstrations against U.S. policy in Nicaragua in another, TheBoston Globe reported.   The agency also conducted two investigations into opponents ofU.S. policies in El Salvador, the newspaper said. The probes werecaptioned ``Salvadoran Leftist Activities in the United States''and ``International Terrorism Investigation re: Leftist GuerrillaActivities in El Salvador,'' the newspaper reported.   The Globe said it obtained the documents under the Freedom ofInformation Act.   The FBI also conducted a separate investigation into members ofTecNica, a group that sends engineers to Nicaragua to work on smallscale development projects, the newspaper reported.   Benjamin Linder, a 27-year-old American engineer who was killedlast year by contra forces, was working with a group affiliatedwith TecNica.   A House subcommittee last year looked into the possibility thatthe FBI's interviews of TecNica volunteers returning from Nicaraguaamounted to an unwarranted investigation of the group.   In addition to the investigations reported by The Globe, twocongressional committees and FBI Director William Sessions areinvestigating the bureau's conduct in its probe of the Committee inSolidarity with the People of El Salvador.   The Globe asked the Center for Constitutional Rights, a publicinterest lawyers group based in New York City, to analyze thedocuments.   David Lerner, a group lawyer, said the documents indicated thatthe FBI's activity was even more widespread than previouslybelieved.   ``The FBI's surveillance of opponents of all the Reagan'sCentral America policies is pervasive. Anyone active in opposingU.S. policy in all of Central America seems to have been atarget,'' the newspaper quoted Lerner as saying.   But FBI spokeswoman Sue Schnitzer denied that the bureau'sinvestigations are politically motivated.   ``We don't go after people because of politics. We go afterpeople we suspect of committing a violation of U.S. law,'' thepaper quoted Schnitzer as saying.   Ann Mari Buitrago of the Center for Constitutional Rights wasquoted as saying it is impossible to determine the number or extentof the various FBI investigations because most of the documentshave been blacked out.   One of the two Nicaraguan documents is captioned ``NicaraguanTerrorist Matters: International Terrorism _ Nicaragua,'' thenewspaper reported. It contains a report on a 1986 demonstration inChicago by Pledge of Resistance, a group that began protesting theadministration's pro-contra policies around 1985.   In 1985, after being questioned by Congress, former FBI DirectorWilliam Webster admitted that FBI agents interviewed more than 100U.S. citizens who had visited Nicaragua, as well as their friends,landlords and employees, in some cases.   Webster said then that some of those interviews may have beenrequested by the CIA or the National Security Council.   The FBI has maintained that its interviews were prompted bycounterintelligence concerns, such as fears that travelers may havebeen asked by Nicaraguan officials to obtain information or spy onthe United States.</TEXT></DOC>
