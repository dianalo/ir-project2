NCSproposed to replace the existing Restoration Priority rules with a newNational Security Emergency Preparedness (NSEP) Telecommunications ServicePriority (TSP) system which has broader scope and applicability. The suggestedrevisions, requiring major changes to Part 64 of FCC rules, were announcedin the Commission's Public Notice released on April 3, 1987. Followingreceipt and analysis of comments from interested parties, the Commissionreleased its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in Gen. Docket No. 87-505adopted November 2, 1987 and released December 2, 1987. The NPRM includeda transcript of the revised rules proposed by NCS, and interested partieswere asked for their views. Comments and reply comments as well as revisionsby NCS to its proposal have dictated the need for the Commission to updateits rules governing priority treatment of provisioning and restorationof common carrier-provided telecommunications services during emergencies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>December 23, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>James M.

Docket No. 87-505 adopted October 27, 1988,and released November 17, 1988. The complete document may be inspectedand copied during the weekday hours of 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in the Commission'sDockets Branch, Room 239, 1919 M St. NW., Washington, DC. A transcriptmay be purchased from the Commission's duplicating contractor, InternationalTranscription Services, 2100 M St. NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037,telephone (202) 857-3800.In 1967, the Commission adopted rules establishing a system of prioritiesapplicable to leased intercity private line services. Those rules, containedin Appendix A of Part 64 of the Commission's rules and known as the RestorationPriority (RP) System, were promulgated to ensure that services vital tothe national interest would be maintained, to the maximum extent possible,during emergency conditions. The RP designation is obtained by submittinga request to NCS in the case of federal and foreign government requests,or to the FCC for state and local government and private industry requests.The FCC is responsible for issuing final notices of priority based on NCSrecommendations or on the requests that come directly to it. The rulesremain effective until superseded by the President's powers under section706 of the Communications Act.In its petition for rulemaking, NCS urged that the current RP System doesnot fully address today's needs for priority treatment of NSEP telecommunicationsservices and that a new TSP System is needed. Under the direction of theExecutive Office of the President, NCS proposed rules to replace the RPSystem with the new TSP System. NCS' proposal was issued by the Commissionas a NPRM released December 2, 1987. A summary of the NPRM was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 17, 1987 (52 FR 47951), and the completedocument was published in the FCC Record at 2 FCC Rcd 24 (1987). Basedon comments and reply comments filed by interested parties, including arevised proposal by NCS in response to some of the concerns discussed inthe NPRM, the Commission has revised Parts 0 and 64 of its rule as setforth below. The revised rules initiate a program that modernizes the meansby which the nation is assured that essential communications services providedby common carriers receive priority provisioning and restoration. The rulesmay serve also as guidance for the provisioning and restoration of privatesystems.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>The Commission is responding to deficiencies in the existing RP System,and adopting a TSP System by which carriers may provide priority provisioningand restoration of service when specific NSEP needs have been identified.The impact of the new TSP rules upon large and small telecommunicationsproviders will vary depending on the number of NSEP services they provide.The burden hours, estimated at 105,000 annually, will be assumed by theNational Communications System/Department of Defense.<ITAG tagnum="84">Ordering Clauses</ITAG>Accordingly, it is ordered, pursuant to authority contained in 47 USC 151,154(i), 201-205 and 303(r), that Parts 0 and 64 of the Commission's Rulesand Regulations are amended as shown at the end of this document effectiveDecember 23, 1988.It is further ordered, that the initial operating capability date of theserules will be nine months after the appearance in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of a summary of the Commission's order concerningthe Executive Office of the President's procedures for implementation.It is further ordered, that the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau is delegatedauthority to participate in and conduct discussions and meetings and issueorders to resolve issues in connection with implementation of the TelecommunicationsService Priority System.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>47 CFR Part 0Commission organization, Functions of Office of Managing Director, Functionsof Common Carrier Bureau, Additional authority delegated to Field OperationsBureau.47 CFR Part 64Communications common carriers, Priority services in emergencies, TelecommunicationsService Priority (TSP) system, National security emergency preparedness(NSEP).<ITAG tagnum="6">Donna R.

This appendix establishes policies and procedures and assigns responsibilitiesfor the National Security Emergency Preparedness (NSEP) TelecommunicationsService Priority (TSP) System. The NSEP TSP System authorizes prioritytreatment to certain domestic telecommunications services (including portionsof U.S. international telecommunication services provided by U.S. servicevendors) for which provisioning or restoration priority (RP) levels arerequested, assigned, and approved in accordance with this appendix.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. This appendix is issued pursuant to sections 1, 4(i), 201 through205 and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.151, 154(i), 201 through 205 and 303(r). These sections grant to the FederalCommunications Commission (FCC) the authority over the assignment and approvalof priorities for provisioning and restoration of common carrier-providedtelecommunications services. Under section 706 of the Communications Act,this authority may be superseded, and expanded to include non-common carriertelecommunication services, by the war emergency powers of the Presidentof the United States. This appendix provides the Commission's Order totelecommunication service vendors and users to comply with policies andprocedures establishing the NSEP TSP System, until such policies and proceduresare superseded by the President's war emergency powers. This appendix isintended to be read in conjunction with regulations and procedures thatthe Executive Office of the President issues (1) to implement responsibilitiesassigned in section 6(b) of this appendix, or (2) for use in the eventthis appendix is superseded by the President's war emergency powers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Together, this appendix and the regulations and procedures issuedby the Executive Office of the President establish one uniform system ofpriorities for provisioning and restoration of NSEP telecommunication servicesboth before and after invocation of the President's war emergency powers.In order that government and industry resources may be used effectivelyunder all condition, a single set of rules, regulations, and proceduresis necessary, and they must be applied on a day-to-day basis to all NSEPservices so that the priorities they establish can be implemented at oncewhen the need arises.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">*In sections 2(a)(2) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order No. 12472, ``Assignmentof National Security and Emergency Preparedness Telecommunications Functions''April 3, 1984 (49 FR 13471 (1984)), the President assigned to the Director,Office of Science and Technology Policy, certain NSEP telecommunicationresource management responsibilities.

Policy</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The NSEP TSP System is the regulatory, administrative, and operationalsystem authorizing and providing for priority treatment, <T3>i.e.,</T3> provisioning and restoration, of NSEP telecommunicationservices. As such, it establishes the framework for telecommunication servicevendors to provision, restore, or otherwise act on a priority basis toensure effective NSEP telecommunication services. The NSEP TSP System allowsthe assignment of priority levels to any NSEP service across three timeperiods, or stress conditions: Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilizations, Attack/War,and Post-Attack/Recovery. Although priority levels normally will be assignedby the Executive Office of the President and retained by service vendorsonly for the current time period, they may be preassigned for the othertwo time periods at the request of service users who are able to identifyand justify in advance, their wartime or post-attack NSEP telecommunicationrequirements. Absent such preassigned priority levels for the Attack/Warand Post-Attack/Recovery periods, priority level assignments for the Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilizationperiod will remain in effect. At all times, priority level assignmentswill be subject to revision by the FCC or (on an interim basis) the ExecutiveOffice of the President, based upon changing NSEP needs.

Each subcategory has itsown criteria. Criteria are also shown for the Emergency NSEP category,which has no sub-categories.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Priority levels of ``1,'' ``2,'' ``3,'' ``4,'' and ``5'' may beassigned for provisioning and/or restoration of Essential NSEP telecommunicationservices. However, for Emergency NSEP telecommunications services, a prioritylevel ``E'' is assigned for provisioning. A restoration priority levelfrom ``1'' through ``5'' may be assigned if an Emergency NSEP service alsoqualifies for such a restoration priority level under the Essential NSEPcategory.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The NSEP TSP System allows the assignment of priority levels toany NSEP telecommunications service across three time periods, or stressconditions: Peacetime/Crisis/Mobilization, Attack/War, and Post-Attack/Recovery.Priority levels will normally be assigned only for the first time period.These assigned priority levels will apply through the onset of any attack,but it is expected that they would later be revised by surviving authorizedtelecommunication resource managers within the Executive Office of thePresident based upon specific facts and circumstances arising during theAttack/War and Post-Attack/Recovery time periods.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Service users may, for their own internal use, assign subprioritiesto their services assigned priority levels.
