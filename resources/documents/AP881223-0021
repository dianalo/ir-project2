David S. Ruder told a House panel Thursday that experts who write``fairness opinions'' often get higher fees if the deal goesthrough. The opinions offer conclusions on the fairness of a buyoutoffer.   Asked by Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., whether fairness opinions wereindependent, Ruder said, ``All in all, I am quite suspicious in asignificant number of cases, that the fairness opinion is preparedby somebody with an incentive to go along with management.   ``Personally, I think that needs to be addressed.''   Ruder said he was giving the House Energy and Commercetelecommunications and finance subcommittee his personal opinion _not that of the SEC, which is currently reviewing all aspects ofleveraged buyouts.   Leveraged buyouts occur when investors borrow heavily to buy outa company and then pay off the debt with that company's cash flow orby the sale of its assets.   Ruder said the commission wants to determine whether it shouldissue new rules to protect investors, and predicted the review wouldcontinue at least through February.   Fairness opinions are primary factors in the transactions, Rudersaid, because ``shareholders accord a great degree of weight to thefact that a favorable opinion has been issued.''   The opinions usually attest that the price offered for shares ofa company is a fair one.   The hired financial adviser must rely almost exclusively on thelimited information that management supplies about the company.   Subcommittee Chairman Edward Markey, D-Mass., said an investmentbank may receive $1 million to prepare the opinion, but $1.5 millionif the deal goes through.   ``It sounds a little bit like a kickback to outsiders,'' Markeysaid.</TEXT></DOC>
