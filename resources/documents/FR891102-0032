To thatend, the standard currently establishes strength requirements for the forwardportion of the roof (i.e., the area most likely to sustain severe damagein a rollover crash) of passenger cars, to increase the resistance of theroof to intrusion and crush. The roof of a stationary vehicle is subjectedto a force of 1\1/2\ times the unloaded weight of the vehicle or 5,000pounds, whichever is less. This force is gradually applied by a rigid testdevice in a static test. During the test, the device may not depress theroof structure more than five inches. In addressing light truck safety, including the possible extension of roofcrush resistance requirements to light trucks, buses and multipurpose passengervehicles, the agency submitted two reports to Congress. The first of theseis entitled, ``Light Truck and Van Safety,'' (May 1987). The second, anApril 1988 update to the 1987 report, is entitled, ``Safety Programs forLight Trucks and Multipurpose Passenger Vehicles.'' As noted in the followingdiscussion, these reports set forth much of the agency's view of lighttruck safety. Standard No. 216 currently applies to passenger cars, but not to lighttrucks, for the reasons set forth in NHTSA's April 1988 light truck reportto Congress:<ITAG tagnum="21">In the early years of NHTSA's existence, the regulatory and researchapproach was based on a clear distinction between the design and intendedpurpose of passenger cars and light trucks. Unlike passenger cars, lighttrucks were designed and used primarily as cargo carrying vehicles ratherthan as people-carrying vehicles. In addition, because light trucks werestructurally different than passenger cars, the agency anticipated thatoccupants of light trucks would not be as vulnerable to injuries as passengercar occupants. Also, car occupants suffered far more deaths and injuriesthan did occupants of light trucks. Thus, the initial standards concentratedon requirements for passenger cars so that the agency could reduce deathsand injuries in those vehicles.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(April 1988. page two.)</ITAG>From 1967 to 1982, the number of light trucks being used to transport passengers,instead of or in addition to property, significantly increased. The CensusBureau's ``Truck Inventory and Use Survey'' shows that the percentage ofpickup truck use for personal transportation purposes increased from 51percent in 1967 to 66 percent in 1982 and that the percentage of use foragricultural purposes decreased from 26 percent to 12 percent in the sametime period. NHTSA's May 1987 Light Truck and Van Safety report to Congressfound that, in general, light trucks and vans have been capturing an increasedshare of the light duty market (including passenger cars), rising from14.9 percent in 1971 to 28.7 percent in 1985. The report also found that(1) in 1977, only 10.2 percent of light truck sales were compact vehicles,while in 1985, the figure was 52.6 percent; (2) pickup trucks were a decliningportion of light truck sales, dropping from 66.8 percent in 1977 to 59.3percent in 1985; (3) van sales slightly increased from 21.3 percent oflight truck sales to 22.7 percent; and (4) there was a large shift withinthe population of new vans from conventional cargo vans toward compactpassenger vans. The agency noted that the greater use of light trucks aspassenger carrying vehicles was leading to increases in the number of lighttrucks and vans on the road, the number of persons transported in suchvehicles, and consequently, the number of persons exposed to crashes inthose vehicles. <ITAG tagnum="84">Safety Need </ITAG>There has thus been a convergence between light trucks and passenger cars,both in their structure (with many trucks in the compact size range) andin their use (with many trucks used for personal transportation ratherthan cargo). These changes point strongly toward the need to reevaluatethe standards applicable to light trucks. NHTSA has responded to thesechanges regarding light trucks by evaluating the degree to which occupantsafety in light trucks can be improved through the extension of existingstandards to those vehicles. In conducting this evaluation, this agencywas mindful that it is required by the National Traffic and Motor VehicleSafety Act to ensure that each standard is appropriate for the vehicletype to which it applies. In the case of Standard No. 216, the agency has observed a significantlygreater incidence of rollover crashes per registered vehicle involvinglight trucks, compared to passenger cars. NHTSA believes that rolloverprotection requirements are especially important for light trucks in viewof traffic crash data which show that the light truck fatality rate (perregistered vehicle) in rollovers is approximately twice that for passengercars. As the agency stated in its April 1988 report to Congress:<ITAG tagnum="21">In rollover crashes, the multipurpose passenger vehicle fatality ratewas 196 percent (1985) and 153 percent (1986) above the average fatalityrate for all light trucks and passenger cars combined. The fatality ratefor small pickups was 118 percent (1985) above average and is 107 percent(1986) above average. The standard pickup rate was 51 percent (1985) aboveaverage and is 47 percent (1986) above average. Higher fatality rates forthe above vehicles are largely a consequence of their greater propensityfor rollover as compared to passenger cars; state accident data indicatepickups roll over 1.5 times more often than passenger cars, and multipurposepassenger vehicles roll over two to three times more often.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(April 1988, p. 10.)</ITAG>An update of these data for 1987 and 1988 indicated that in rollover crashes,the multipurpose passenger vehicle fatality rate was 137 percent (1987)and 98 percent (1988) above the average for light trucks and passengercars combined. The fatality rate for small pickups was 103 percent (1987)and 104 percent (1988) above average. The standard pickup fatality ratewas 63 percent (1987) and 65 percent (1988) above average. While the fatalityrates for multipurpose passenger vehicles and small pickups have showndeclines since 1985, the rates are still generally above the average lightduty vehicle rate. Crash data indicate that during the period 1985-1988, the number of fatalitiesinvolved in light truck rollover events were 2,995 (1985); 3,387 (1986);3,658 (1987); and 3,815 (1988). The agency believes that the number oflight truck occupants killed in rollover crashes can be significantly reducedby reducing the number of occupants ejected in those crashes. This beliefis based on the finding in NHTSA's May 1987 light truck and van safetyreport that a principal cause of the high fatality rate in light truckrollover crashes is occupant ejection; over two thirds of light truck rolloverfatalities are ejectees. Accordingly, increased use of safety belts andimprovements to other features (e.g., glazing) may reduce rollover fatalitiesby reducing ejection and holding occupants in place within the passengercompartment during rollovers. However, the agency believes that the benefits from these ejection-preventionmeasures will be fully realized only if adequate protection is providedto guard against the collapse of the passenger compartment roof in a rollovercrash. NHTSA tentatively concludes that amending Standard No. 216 to setroof-crush requirements for light trucks will complement regulatory actionsthat are directed toward reducing ejections and the accompanying risk ofinjury and fatality in rollovers. NHTSA also notes that this agency iscurrently conducting research on ways to reduce the likelihood of rolloverinvolvement. NHTSA is proposing to require light trucks to withstand a force 1\1/2\times their weight, without the 5,000-pound limit applicable to passengercars. The agency included the 5,000-pound ceiling for cars primarily toavoid requiring the redesign of large cars that could not meet the limitson roof crush when tested at 1\1/2\ times their weight. At that time, theagency believed that requiring the redesign of large cars would be unnecessaryin view of their lower rollover tendency. NHTSA has tentatively determined that there is no equivalent reason whythere should be a 5,000-pound limit on the force that light truck roofsmust withstand. In light of their high rollover involvement and fatalityrates, NHTSA tentatively concludes that light trucks should meet a forcecrush limit of 1\1/2\ times their weight and that a force ceiling shouldnot be provided. NHTSA believes this action will help ensure the crashworthinessof light trucks in rollover crashes. However, the agency requests commentsfrom the industry and public regarding the advantages and disadvantagesof a weight ceiling for light trucks. NHTSA also specifically requests comments relating to the possible impactsof this proposed rule on final-stage manufacturers and alterers, and whetherthose impacts should be reduced by applying the standard only to MPV'sand trucks having a GVWR of 8,500 pounds or less. This issue is furtherdiscussed in NHTSA's preliminary regulatory evaluation for this proposal,copies of which have been placed in the agency's rulemaking docket. (Acopy of the evaluation can be obtained by writing to: Docket Section, NHTSA,Room 5109, 400 Seventh St., SW., Washington, DC 20590.) This proposed extension of Standard No. 216 excludes school buses fromthe category of light truck to which this NPRM is addressed. The reasonfor this is that school buses must already comply with their own roof crushand other rollover crash protection requirements which generally are thesame as the requirements proposed in this notice. Standard No. 220, SchoolBus Rollover Protection (49 CFR 571.220), limits roof crush to not morethan 5\1/8\ inches upon the application of vertical downward force to thebus roof of 1\1/2\ times the vehicle's unloaded weight. Similar to therule proposed in this notice, Standard No. 220 does not set a 5,000-poundor other weight limit on the applied force, other than limiting the forceto 1\1/2\ times the unloaded weight. Given the similarity in requirementsof Standards 220 and 216, NHTSA believes school bus safety would not besignificantly improved by extending Standard No. 216 to those vehicles.<ITAG tagnum="84">Voluntary Compliance </ITAG>NHTSA obtained information from light truck manufacturers showing thatthere appears to be widespread voluntary compliance with the requirementsset forth in Standard No. 216 for cars. (This information has been placedin Docket No. 87-11, Notice 1.) Information available to NHTSA also indicatesthat the majority of light trucks meet the roof crush displacement limitsof the standard when tested at 1\1/2\ times the vehicle's unloaded vehicleweight, even though the resulting force may exceed the 5,000 pound limitfor passenger cars.In past regulatory matters involving widespread voluntary compliance, theagency has generally concluded that there is no compelling safety needfor it to act when vehicle manufacturers are voluntarily taking the desiredsteps absent any Federal requirement to do so. In those circumstances,NHTSA has frequently determined that rulemaking would impose a burden onthe agency by requiring it to develop appropriate requirements, conducta rulemaking proceeding, and use some of its enforcement budget to monitorcompliance. Such rules would also impose additional paperwork burdens onthe manufacturers, even though they would take the desired action in anycase. Those burdens would be imposed without a commensurate safety benefitfor the public, and would therefore represent unnecessary burdens. However, on occasion, the agency proceeds with rulemaking in such situations,particularly when a standard of major importance is involved. For example,NHTSA recently issued a final rule requiring installation of lap/shoulderbelts in the rear seats of cars, although most models were already voluntarilyslated to be so equipped within the next few years. NHTSA tentatively concludes that it is similarly appropriate to extendStandard No. 216 to light trucks, notwithstanding the current level ofapparent voluntary compliance. The roof-crush protection represented bythe standard is clearly important for light truck occupant safety, giventhe rollover rate for many of them. Further, although most manufacturersbelieve that their vehicles would comply with the standard's requirementsfor passenger cars, and information available to the agency indicates thatmost light trucks can comply when tested to 1\1/2\ times the unloaded vehicleweight, some manufacturers apparently do not meet the proposed standardfor their entire light truck fleet. As light trucks continue to grow inpopularity and sales, NHTSA believes it is important to ensure that allsuch vehicles meet at least the minimum standards specified in StandardNo. 216. Moreover, the agency believes it is important to ensure that anynew entrants to the light truck market will follow the lead of their competitorsin meeting the proposed requirements. NHTSA therefore tentatively concludesthat amending Standard No. 216 as proposed in this notice will satisfya safety need by ensuring uniform safety performance for all affected vehicles.<ITAG tagnum="84">Leadtime </ITAG>NHTSA proposes that the requirements for light trucks become effectiveSeptember 1, 1991. The agency tentatively concludes that the widespreadvoluntary compliance with Standard No. 216 demonstrates the availabilityof the engineering and manufacturing resources needed to implement thisproposal by that date. Comments are requested on the leadtime necessaryto comply with the proposal, if a final rule is adopted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Costs and Benefits </ITAG>NHTSA has analyzed this proposal and determined that it is not ``major''within the meaning of Executive Order 12291. Given the already substantiallevel of voluntary compliance with the proposed requirements, adoptionof those requirements would have limited cost implications. NHTSA estimatesthis cost would be well below the $100 million costs that are needed toclassify a rule as ``major'' under Executive Order 12291.However, the costs of altering light trucks to meet the proposed requirementsare not definitely known. A 1982 NHTSA evaluation of changes made to passengercars in 1974 indicated that the cost for component changes in some modelswas $11 in 1988 dollars. However, it is uncertain whether this estimatewould be applicable to light trucks. Potentially more costs may be incurredfor vehicles that are built on chassis by final-stage manufacturers forcommercial or recreational use, and for vehicles that are modified by alterersfor these uses. Because of the proliferation of vehicle types, these manufacturersand alterers could face higher compliance costs. Based on previous testsconducted for NHTSA, an FMVSS 216 certification test should cost approximately$1,500 per test. Because of the need for more specific cost information,comments are requested from the industry and public regarding: (1) Thenumber of vehicles that would not meet the standard; (2) the costs andweight increases associated with bringing these vehicles up to the standard;(3) the number of vehicles that would have to be tested; and (4) the totalcost of testing and certification. This proposal is ``significant'' within the meaning of the Department ofTransportation's regulatory policies and procedures because of the publicinterest in this rule. As noted above, NHTSA has prepared a preliminaryregulatory evaluation for this proposed rule, which can be obtained fromNHTSA's Docket Section. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>NHTSA has considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act. NHTSA has examined the potential impacts of this ruleon small entities and has described those possible impacts in the preliminaryregulatory evaluation, a portion of which contains the discussion requiredof an initial regulatory flexibility analysis. To summarize that evaluation,there are a number of final-stage manufacturers, many of whom are smallbusinesses, which install truck bodies and/or work-related equipment onchassis. These manufacturing processes may involve the roof structure onvehicles. Also, there are a number of alterers involved in modifying (e.g.,raising) the roof structure. The potential impact of this proposed ruleon these entities depends on the number of different models that are producedby them, the amount of testing done to determine compliance with the roofcrush standard, and the ability of vehicles to conform with the standard.NHTSA tentatively believes that the task which these manufacturers andalterers would face in certifying compliance of their vehicles or alterationto the proposed requirements would not differ significantly from the tasksthey face currently in certifying compliance with other standards. However,the agency believes it will be able to further analyze the impacts of therule on small entities after receiving comments on the potential costsand other impacts of the proposed rule Small organizations and governmental units would not be significantly affected.While there might be a relatively small price increase for those vehicleswhich have to be modified to achieve compliance, NHTSA does not anticipateany significant impacts for any small entity interested in purchasing suchvehicles. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental effects </ITAG>NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action for the purposes of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act. The agency has determined that implementationof this action would not have any significant impact on the quality ofthe human environment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism </ITAG>This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that therulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrantthe preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Information Number </ITAG>A regulatory information number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory actionlisted in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Regulatory InformationService Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of eachyear. The RIN contained in the heading of this document can be used tocross-reference this action with the Unified Agenda. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments </ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It isrequested but not required that 10 copies be submitted. All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessaryattachments may be appended to these submissions without regard to the15-page limit.
