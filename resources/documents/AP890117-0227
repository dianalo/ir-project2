The price jump will not spill over onto prices of consumerproducts such as home heating oil and gasoline unless it lasts for aconsiderable period of time, analysts say.   The February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude oil, jumped 40 cents on Monday to settle at$18.88 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   The last time the near-month contract settled higher was Nov. 20,1987, amid hostilities in the Persian Gulf in the Iran-Iraq war. Itsettled that day at $18.93.   Although Persian Gulf troubles no longer are an issue, the priceof the near-month contract for West Texas Intermediate has soared 50percent since an intraday low of $12.28 a barrel on Oct. 5.   One reason for the increase is speculation that some kind ofproduction agreement may be reached at a meeting beginning Jan. 26in London between members of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries and non-OPEC countries, according to Gene Nowak, ananalyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.   Nevertheless, analysts said the latest surge seemed more theresult of emotion than news.   ``The main thing we've got getting this market up is momentum.I'd have to list that as the first cause,'' said Peter Beutel,assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc.   ``There's no underlying structural reason. There's no shortage,''said John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry ResearchFoundation.   Prices began rising in October on expectations that OPEC memberswould agree to cut production as a way of propping up prices. Anagreement was reached in late November and took effect Jan. 1.   Analysts said OPEC's production has been 19 million barrels a dayor slightly more, above its self-imposed quota of 18.5 millionbarrels but well below December's production.   In a sign that many traders expect the surge in oil prices to beshort-lived, prices for delivery in later months were significantlylower.   The March contract for West Texas Intermediate rose 27 cents to$17.95 a barrel; the April contract rose 21 cents to $17.37 abarrel; and the May contract rose 14 cents to $16.98 a barrel.   Among refined products traded on the New York MercantileExchange, the February contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.94 centto 50.91 cents a gallon and the February contract for No. 2 heatingoil rose 0.21 cent to 53.16 cents a gallon.   The intraday trading high _ the highest point reached during thetrading session _ was $18.93 for the February contract for WTI. Thattopped the 1988 intraday high of $18.92 on April 18, which alsopreceded a meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC nations, Beutel said.</TEXT></DOC>
