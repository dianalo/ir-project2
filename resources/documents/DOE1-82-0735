The problem ofthis work was to ascertain the effect of some physicochemical propertiesof carbonaceous materials on their electrocatalytic properties in theelectro-oxidation of sulfur dioxide. As objects of investigation we tookcarbonaceous materials of various structures: carbon cloths, graphite,and AG-3 activated carbon. The carbon cloths were prepared from viscousfiber and were heat-treated in the temperature range 800-2400{sup 0}.All catalysts were studied in the form of powders having a grain sizeless than 40 {mu}. The carbon cloths were preliminary ground in a mortar.To compare the electrocatalytic activity of the carbonaceous materials,we used a model floating electrode, in which a kinetic regime of thesulfur dioxide oxidation process is realized in a definite potentialregion on the disperse carbonaceous materials.</TEXT></DOC>
