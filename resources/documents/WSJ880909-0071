In a Sept. 2 letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Otis Bowen that accompanied the draft order, Gary Bauer, President Reagan's assistant for policy development, said the order is designed &quot;to protect unborn and newborn children from experiments, research and organ transplantation,&quot; except when they would directly benefit.    He asked Dr. Bowen to send any comments on the proposed order to the White House by today. In an interview, however, Mr. Bauer said the draft has no immediate policy implications. &quot;The leaked document could not even be described as a draft,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a discussion piece. No immediate action is planned on this issue.&quot; The letter to secretary Bowen describes it as &quot;a draft executive order,&quot; however.    Charles Clark, president of the American Diabetes Association, said such an executive order would have &quot;a detrimental effect&quot; on promising research for diabetics and others. Certain transplanted fetal cells can produce insulin with less rejection than adult cells and, unlike adult cells, fetal cells reproduce, according to Dr. Clark, a professor at Indiana University School of Medicine.    The proposed order would deny federal funding to &quot;activities and procedures not in conformance&quot; with the outlined policy. In addition, fetal tissue transplantation would be prohibited in federal facilities and by federal agencies. According to the draft, the final order is to be issued by Nov. 1.    Dr. Clark said the proposed order would be &quot;more far reaching&quot; than a March directive from the assistant secretary of health, which discontinued fetal tissue transplants from induced abortions at the National Institutes of Health.    That directive stopped the transplants at least until related legal and ethical issues are studied by an outside advisory committee convened by the NIH director. The executive order is more specific than the directive and would render the committee, which hasn't yet met, irrelevant.    Anti-abortion groups have urged the Reagan administration to issue such an order because &quot;we're against using (fetuses) as guinea pigs,&quot; said Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee. &quot;This organization has encouraged its members to write to the president for an executive order.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
