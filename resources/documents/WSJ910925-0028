Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, the formerLincoln officials -- chairman Robin Symes, president RaymondFidel and vice president for branch operations Dariush Razavi-- agreed not to violate securities laws in the future. Thethree also are cooperating with the SEC, the agency said.</LP><TEXT>   That cooperation is expected to help the SEC build itscase against former American Continental Chairman CharlesKeating, who is standing trial on California state criminalcharges related to the bond sales. The SEC is expected tobring a case against Mr. Keating in the next several months.Also, the Department of Justice and other federal agenciesare investigating Mr. Keating, and federal criminal chargesare expected.   The SEC alleged that the three men supervised thefraudulent sale of American Continental subordinateddebentures through Lincoln branches or satellite officeslocated near Lincoln branches. Lincoln customers never weretold about the risks involved in the securities, the SECsaid. The agency said American Continental raised more than$275 million from investors through about 22,000 transactionsin the debentures. American Continental filed forbankrupcty-law protection last year, making the debt unlikelyto be repaid.   &quot;Lincoln was engaged in a monumental effort to sell ACCdebentures&quot; from December 1986 through February 1989, saidBruce Hiler, SEC associate enforcement director. &quot;Thesepeople are the supervisors, they are the management people.&quot;   Lincoln bond representatives, managers, assistant managersand customer service representatives (previously calledtellers) sold the securities through a program called&quot;cross-selling,&quot; the SEC said. Lincoln customers were led tobelieve that the securities were insured by the federalgovernment and as safe as certificates of deposit, when infact they were uninsured and very risky, the SEC said.   &quot;People would come in to the Sandamp;L with a CD to turn itover, and would look at the same faces they'd always lookedat. But instead of a safe, sound investment, they were beingdirected to an unsound investment,&quot; Mr. Hiler said. &quot;Theydidn't really have a chance to understand what they weregetting into.&quot;   The SEC's civil charges followed a guilty plea earlierthis year by Mr. Symes to two counts of federal securitiesfraud and six counts of state fraud. Mr. Fidel also earlierpleaded guilty to federal and state criminal fraud. Mr.Razavi faces no criminal charges.   Separately, the agency charged former Cowen andamp; Co. analystBaruch Rosenberg with insider trading in 1988 in the stock ofApollo Computer Inc.   The SEC said Mr. Rosenberg traded in Apollo Computer stockafter an Apollo executive voiced concerns to him aboutearnings for the second quarter.   But Mr. Rosenberg didn't pass that information to Cowenclients before Apollo announced it several days later.Instead, the analyst sold his 10,623 shares of Apollo stock,the SEC said. When Apollo announced the weak results the dayafter Mr. Rosenberg completed his sales, the stock dropped28%. By making his sale earlier, the analyst avoided lossesof $45,163.   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Mr. Rosenbergsettled the charges, paying $90,326 in restitution and fines.Moreover, he consented to administrative findings thatsuspend him from the industry for a year.   In New York, a lawyer for Mr. Rosenberg said his clientsettled the case because &quot;rather than spending his timedefending the charges, he decided to put the matter behindhim and get on with his life.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
