(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>When we received information on the Pro Series from ViewStar, a three-yearold company out of Berkeley, California, we were intrigued-but confused.andO;ViewStar's literature talks a lot about compound documents, yet the ProSeries doesn't produce compound documents .It also seemed a bit like aprocedural automation package, but it's not that either.andP;  As described byViewS tar, the Pro Series is a LANbased workflow automation package, or adocument management system.andM;WORKFLOW AUTOMATION.andP;  ViewStar regards documents as works-inprogress.andP;  Whenyou're working on a business report, you usually go through various stages:gathering information, collaborating ideas with other people, getting thereport reviewed and approved, revising it, prettying it up, etc.andP;  Well, thePro Series won't generate die document.andP;  In fact, the Pro Series doesn'tgenerate anything.andP;  Rather, it takes the documents (and we mean documents ina broad sense here-text, graphics, spreadsheets, etc.) you've already createdand automates the development stages.andP;  For instance, you can scan a reportinto the system, embed in it a picture from your standard graphics package,route it to various colleagues, and have it automatically routed back to youas a single document with everybody's input.andP;  Or you can create an electronicfolder that holds all the information necessary for the review and approvalcycle of a project or a job applicant.andP;  As the folder moves from person toperson, the documents inside are annotated with comments and highlights.andO;Someone can also drop a memo created in his or her standard word processorinto the folder.andM;Documents are fed into the Pro Series system by faxing, scanning, andimporting ASCII documents.andP;  The system also accepts data extracted from minisand mainframes.andP;  However, once it's in the system, the document is not liveor processable.andP;  When someone marks it up, he or she is really marking up alayer on top of the document.andP;  Thus, if you route a report to five differentreviewers, the system will create five separate layers.andP;  You can either lookat the input of one person in isolation or the input of all five in a singledocument.andM;PRO SERIES DESIGN.andP;  The Pro Series is made up of an integrated series ofcomponents:andM;* VS*Shell, the system's graphical user interface, is modeled afterPresentation Manager, providing a desktop metaphor for file management andprocessing with pull-down menus, dialogue boxes, icon, scrollbars, etc.andP;  Italso provides access to the other ViewS tar modules, as well as a specialdocument &quot;collector&quot; for personal document sorting, assembly, and routing,andM;* VS*Script is a programming language with an embedded structure for systemextension and customization.andP;  Functions of the system (such as screens,scanner input routines, database access logic, etc.) are separate objectsthat can be reused, modified, and/or strung together to create new orenhanced applications.andP;  For instance, programs can be written to automatespecific routings and review cycles.andP;  VS*Script also provides interfaces forexternal C programs and embedded SQL calls.andP;  It contains data types, codestructures, operators, conditionals, and I/O functions, in addition to higherlevel features such as incremental compiling and linkage.andP;  Functionality inVS*Script is of varying degrees, ranging from basic script commands for usersto advanced tools for system extension and modification.andM;* VS*Star, a distributed database, is responsible for integrating the system's modules and provides the basis for document management and processing.andP;  Italso defines the tools for document security and access rights as well as fordatabase administration.andP;  It's made up of six components (described in theaccompanying illustration).andP;  * VS*Express, the system's electronic mailcomponent, sends messages, documents, markups, annotations, programs writtenby VS*Script, and references embedded within a document.andP;  In addition, itmonitors the flow of routing and review cycles.andM;* VS*Markup is a redlining or annotation feature that keeps track of eachannotatee.andP;  &quot;Comment tags&quot; or postits of any length can also be attached to adocument, either on the fly or by importing a DOS file.andP;  You can even inserta script tag into the document (i.e., program the next action).andP;  * VS* Designis a limited editing feature.andP;  For full-feawred editing, ViewStar reverts tothe original package.andP;  However, it does have some helpful features,including: revision tracking; graphic primitive overlays; cut and paste; panand zoom; rotating, scaling, and grouping functions; and text strings,labels, and blocks.andM;* VS*Scan provides driver-level scanning support.andM;* VS*View provides document display and manipulation.andM;* VS*Print provides the system's print-spooling capabilities.andM;COST AND CONFIGURATION.andP;  The Pro Series can be purchased either as a totalsystem or modularly.andP;  Pricing starts at $50,000.andP;  A 15-user system, forinstance, costs about $150,000.andP;  The system currently uses 286/386 PCs andPS/2 computers running MS Windows.andM;CONCLUSION.andP;  The Pro Series is somewhat limited in what it can do for you asa means of collaborative editing.andP;  The work done within the Pro Series systemdoesn't stay with the document.andP;  When you import it back into your originalenvironment, you still have to re-input all that information.andP;  However, thesystem is software independent, and thus caters to the kind of situation youusually find on a LAN, where a whole medley of software and document typesexists.andP;  You don't often find that kind of support.andP;  The system embedsdocuments with intelligence about interrelationships to other documents,ownership, and how they participate in the workflow.andP;  L.
