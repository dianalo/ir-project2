In connection with this type of conversion theFSLIC-insured status of the institution is necessarily terminated, a consequenceof which is the automatic removal of the institution from membership inthe FHLBank System pursuant to section 407(i) of the NHA.\1\<NOTE/> However, andSection; 523.3-1 of the FHLBank Regulations providesthat a member institution that has been removed from FHLBank membershipas a result of its conversion to a state-chartered savings bank and terminationof FSLIC-insured status_<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Section 407(i) provides, in pertinent part, that ``terminationunder (section 407) or otherwise of the status of an institution as aninsured institution shall automatically constitute a removal under (section6(i)) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of the institution from [FHLBank)membership, if at the time of such termination such institution is a memberof (an FHLBank) * * *.'' 12 U.S.C. 1730(i).<ITAG tagnum="20">shall be deemed, as of the effective date of [its] conversion, tobe automatically approved by the Board as a member, provided that suchinstitution, acting by its board of directors or board of trustees, hasmade written requests to the [FHL]Bank of the district in which it is locatedfor such membership and such Bank has approved such request.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">12 CFR 523.3-1 (1988).\2\<NOTE/> Accordingly, under the Board's FHLBank Regulations, FSLIC-insuredinstitutions that have converted to savings banks insured by the FDIC havebeen able to gain readmission to their FHLBanks immediately upon conversion.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The regulation also provides that, in the case of an automaticallyapproved application, all loan, deposit, stock and other relationshipsexisting between the converting member and the FHLBank shall continue ineffect without interruption. <T3>Id</T3>.In the context of recent applications involving the conversions of Federally-chartered,FSLIC-insured thrifts to state-chartered, FDIC-insured savings banks, theBoard was advised by the staff that serious questions exist as to the continuingvalidity of andSection; 523.3-1 of the FHLBank Regulations as well as theBoard's legal authority to readmit as FHLBank members such converting institutions.The bases for these concerns are discussed below. The Board did not actat that time to prevent the readmission to FHLBank membership of the savingsbank applicants;\3\<NOTE/> however, the Board did make known these concerns to the publicin a January 22, 1988, release and, in order to elicit public comment onthis issue, directed the staff to draft a proposed amendment to the FHLBankRegulations that would revoke andSection; 523.3-1. As a result of these concerns,on July 11, 1988, the Board also issued an order to the FHLBanks \4\<NOTE/> pursuant to section 17(a) of the FHLBank Act directing them(1) to treat any FSLIC-insured institution that henceforth terminates itsFSLIC insurance of accounts as having been removed from FHLBank membership,(2) to refrain from approving any application by such an institution foradmission to Federal Home Loan Bank membership pursuant to andSection;andSection;523.3-1 or 523.3-3 of the Board's FHLBank Regulations, and (3) to submitall such applications to the Board for its determination until such timeas the Board makes a final decision regarding andSection; 523.3-1.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ This decision was based in part on the fact that the convertinginstitutions in question had received prior approval from their FHLBanksto be readmitted as members upon conversion. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Board Resolution No. 88-575, dated July 11, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Section 523.3-3 authorizes the Principal Supervisory Agent(``PSA'') of an FHLBank to approve unprotested applications for FHLBankmembership by entities that satisfy the criteria for membership. 12 CFR523.3-3. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of the Proposal</ITAG>In section 102 of the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act of 1966 (``FISA''),Pub. L. No. 89-695, section 102, 80 Stat. 1028, 1036-45, Congress amendedsection 407 of the NHA by adding a new subsection (i). As noted above,section 407(i) provides in part that an institution's termination of FSLICinsurance of accounts shall constitute an automatic removal of the institutionfrom FHLBank membership under section 6(i) of the FHLBank Act, 12 U.S.C.1426(i).\6\<NOTE/> The legislative history of FISA seems to indicate that themembership removal provisions of section 407(i) were aimed primarily atthose institutions whose FSLIC insurance was terminated involuntarily pursuantto section 407(b) of the NHA.\7\<NOTE/> However, in view of the broad language in the statute referringto all instances in which an institution's FSLIC-insured status was terminated,it became evident that under section 407(i), an association insured bythe FSLIC that converted to an FDIC-insured savings bank would automaticallylose its FHLBank membership. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Section 6(i) also provides that an institution may withdrawfrom membership in an FHLBank six months after notifying the bank of itsintent to do so and that an institution may be removed by the Board if,after a hearing, the Board determines that the institution either (i) hasfailed to comply with the FHLBank Act or any Board regulation thereunder,or (ii) is insolvent. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>S. Rep. No. 1482, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 18-19 (1966).In apparent recognition of this fact, the Board in 1970 amended its FHLBankRegulations by adding andSection; 523.3-1.\8\<NOTE/> The new provision has not only enabled an institution thathad been removed pursuant to section 407(i) s a result of its conversionto a state-chartered savings bank to regain FHLBank membership upon theapproval of the FHLBank in whose district the institution was located,but has also made it clear that where such an institution is readmittedas a FHLBank member, all of its preexisting loan and other relationshipswith the FHLBank would continue without interruption, as if the thrifthad never left the FHLBank System. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Board Resolution No. 70-47, dated July 14, 1970, 35 FR11616 (July 21, 1970). In the Board's view, the continuing legal validity of andSection; 523.3-1is called into question by the enactment of section 6(m) of the FHLBankAct, 12 U.S.C. 1426(m), in andSection; 355 of the Garn-St Germain DepositoryInstitutions Act of 1982 (``Garn-St Germain Act''), Pub. L. No. 97-320,section 355, 96 Stat. 1469, 1508. Section 6(m) generally prohibits ``aninstitution which withdraws from [FHLBank] membership'' from being readmittedto the FHLBank System until the expiration of a five-year period afterits withdrawal.\9\<NOTE/> To the extent that this provision applies to institutionsthat are removed from FHLBank membership pursuant to section 407(i) ofthe NHA, the Board's regulation_which permits immediate readmission ofinstitutions that have converted to FDIC-insured savings banks_would appearto be preempted by the statute. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ In section 355 of the Garn-St Germain Act, Congress alsoamended section 6(i) of the FHLBank Act to provide that in the case ofa ``voluntary withdrawal'' from district bank membership, the withdrawinginstitution must pay prepayment penalties in connection with liquidatingany indeptedness owed to its district bank if its advances agreement withsuch FHLBank so provides. 12 U.S.C. 1426(i).The Board is aware that one possible arguments against preemption couldhinge on the use of the term ``withdraws'' in section 6(m) and a distinctionbeing made between ``withdrawals'' and ``removals'' from FHLBank membership,with the result that the five-year bar on FHLBank readmissions containedin section 6(m) would only be imposed in the case of a voluntary ``withdrawal''from FHLBank membership and not in a situation in which the institutionis involuntarily ``removed'' from membership pursuant to section 407(i)of the NHA or otherwise.\10\<NOTE/> However, the Board is not convinced that Congress, by draftingsection 6(m) in this manner, intended to restrict its application to alimited type of voluntary departure from the FHLBank System. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ This interpretation of the ``withdraws'' language insection 6(m) is also supported by the view that the Congressional intendin adopting section 355 of the Garn-St Germain Act was merely to preventan FHLBank member with substantial high-interest advances outstanding fromavoiding prepayment penalties on those advances by terminating its FHLBankmembership, liquidating its indebtedness to its FHLBank (without penalty),and thereafter being readmitted as an FHLBank member. However, the Boardis aware of no legislative history supporting such a narrow reading ofsection 355. As an initial matter, the Board notes that the types of transactions atissue, where an institution terminates FSLIC insurance and in so doingcauses its removal from FHLBank membership pursuant to section 407(i) ofthe NHA, are voluntarily undertaken. Arguably, it would be semantic hairsplitting, contrary to the statutory purpose, to say that termination ofFHLBank membership under a linked, two-step sequence voluntarily begunby the affected institution should be treated differently from situationswhere the instituion simply takes the second step without the first. Accordingly,the Board believes that terminations of FHLBank membership in the contextof conversions to FDIC insurance are most properly viewed as voluntarywithdrawals well within the scope of section 6(m). Moreover, the Board is of the view that a termination of FHLBank membershipneed not be independently volitional at each step in order to be subjectto the statute. In this vein, the Board first notes that, whereas the prepaymentpenalty provision of section 6(i) of the FHLBank Act_which were also adoptedin section 355 of the Garn-St Germain Act_make reference to ``voluntarywithdrawals'' from FHLBank membership, section 6(m) applies to all membershipwithdrawals. In order to give independent meaning to the use of the term``voluntary'' in section 6(i), it would seem to the Board that the ``withdraws''language of section 6(m) must be read to include not only terminationsof FHLBank membership that are voluntarily effected by an institution butalso cessations of membership that are less directly the result of themember institution's own international act. The Board also notes that section 6(m) contains exceptions from its disqualificationprovisions for withdrawals that are either as a consequence of a transferof membership on a non-interrupted basis between FHLBanks or in connectionwith a member's obtaining a charter from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.The inclusion of exceptions in the statute for withdrawals under thesecircumstances constitutes evidence that Congress thought that, in the absenceof the exceptions, such withdrawls would be subject to section 6(m), andprovides further support for the view that Congress intended that the disqualificationprovisions of the statute would apply to cessations of FHLBank membershipthat are not themselves intended but are incidental to or a consequenceof other voluntarily undertaken actions by a member. In addition to the language of the statute, the legislative history ofsection 6(m) is also consistent with a broad interpretation of this provision.As the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs stated inits Report on S. 2879 (the Senate version of the Garn-St Germain Act),``[new andSection; 6(m)] would prevent institutions leaving the FHLBank Systemfrom reentering for five years thereafter except in connection with receivinga federal charter.''\11\<NOTE/> Both the express language as well as the legislative historyof section 6(m) would therefore appear to support the view that terminationsof FHLBank membership that occur in connection with voluntary departuresfrom the FSLIC insurance system are covered by the statute. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ S. Rep. No. 536, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 59 (1982). In sum, the Board has serious concerns as to whether the provisions ofandSection; 523.3-1 of the Board's FHLBank Regulations have been overriddenby section 6(m) of the FHLBank Act, whether the Board and the FHLBanksare empowered to readmit institutions removed from membership under section407(i) of the NHA upon their conversions to FDIC-insured savings banks,and whether the readmissions pursuant to andSection; 523.3-1 that have takenplace since the Garn-St Germain Act was enacted on October 15, 1982, arelegally valid.In view of these concerns, the Board is today proposing to remove currentandSection; 523.3-1 and to adopt a new provision that would generally prohibitreadmission of any institution whose FHLBank membership is terminated pursuantto the provisions of section 6(i) of the FHLBank Act for a period of fiveyears following the date of such institution's departure from the FHLBanksystem. In connection with the issuance of this proposal, the Board isalso soliciting the views of the public with respect to the issues discussedabove. Specifically, the Board requests comment on whether the adoptionof section 6(m) of the FHLBank Act in 1982 precludes the Board and theFHLBanks from readmitting as members for a five-year period those FSLIC-insuredinstitutions that convert to state-chartered savings banks insured by theFDIC. Noting that a number of the institutions that have effected suchconversions since October 15, 1982, have been readmitted as FHLBank memberspursuant to andSection; 523.3-1, the Board also requests the public's viewsas to whether the Board could allow such institutions to continue to betreated as FHLBank members in the event that it is ultimately determinedthat andSection; 523.3-1 has been preempted by section 6(m), and under whatlegal theory it could do so.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603,the Board is providing the following initial regulatory flexibility analysis:1. <T3>Reasons, objectives and legal bases underlying the proposed rules.</T3>These elements have been discussed elsewhere in the SUPPLEMENTARYINFORMATION regarding the proposal.2. <T3>Small entities to which the proposed rules would apply. </T3>The SmallBusiness Administration defines a small financial institution as ``a commercialbank or savings and loan association, the assets of which, for the precedingfiscal year, do not exceed $100 million.'' 13 CFR 121.13(a) (1988).
