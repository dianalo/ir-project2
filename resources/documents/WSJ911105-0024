In recent days several of the country's most augustfinancial institutions, jolted by last month's furorsurrounding the confirmation of Associate Supreme CourtJustice Clarence Thomas, have issued unusual gender-sensitivedecrees.</LP><TEXT>   In a firm-wide letter yesterday, the chairman of MerrillLynch andamp; Co. warned that the nation's biggest brokerage firmwould &quot;not tolerate any form of sexual harassment.&quot; MorganStanley Group Inc., Bear Stearns Cos., Prudential SecuritiesInc., Salomon Brothers Inc. and First Boston Corp. have allissued similar warnings. Even the little Coffee, Sugar andamp;Cocoa Exchange is reviewing its policies.   But there is both good news and bad news behind suchwell-intentioned pronouncements: Wall Street offers womensome of the best opportunities in America for reaping hugefinancial rewards, power and prominence, and pays lip-serviceto an ethic of equal opportunity. But at the same time, asthe new warnings from management suggest, the industryremains subject to old-boy customs that many women see as ahindrance, from their first raunchy hazing until their finalbump against the still-fixed glass ceiling.   The coffee exchange's campaign against sexism illustratesthe persistence of the problem. Although the exchange decreedlast February that &quot;all inappropriate pictures, pinups andpostcards&quot; featuring nude women were to be removed from thetrading floor, yesterday pinups of bare breasts were stillstapled to the walls of some traders' booths, in full view ofthe men and women who dart about the exchange floor. Askedabout this, an exchange senior vice president, James Bowe,artfully notes that in the three-quarters of the tradingbooths he checked at least, there was only &quot;one postcard withgirls in bikinis on it.&quot; Ludicrous though such prudishpolicing may seem, the point, say many who work there, isthat despite the most high-minded pronouncements, the gapbetween policy and practice remains wide on Wall Street.   To be sure, Wall Street's record may be no worse than thatof corporate America as a whole, and in fact, the Street isone of the few arenas in which a woman with enough drive andskill can break into the seven-figure income bracket.   But while women have indisputably made gains in thefinancial world over the past 20 years, statistics suggestthat their climb to the top has been slow. Women hold 40% ofthe jobs at Wall Street's 10 largest securities firms, butthey make up just 4% of all partners and managing directors-- these firms' most coveted and highly paid positions,according to a Wall Street Journal survey. At Goldman, Sachsandamp; Co., Wall Street's most successful investment bank, justfour of the 146 partners are women. At the New York StockExchange, only two of the 26 directors are women.   And such numbers only hint at the kinds of subtlediscrimination many women say they still face, from the firstday of job interviews to the assignments they get -- often inless glamorous areas such as securities and economic researchand municipal finance -- to the salaries they take home. Morethan many industries, the brokerage business is based onpersonal relationships, steeped in prankish humor, andreliant on clannish favor-swapping. Whether deals areclinched on the golf course or in the deep leather chairs ofNew York's hoary and, until recently, all-male clubs, the OldBoys, say many women, still hold the advantage.   Not all women agree, and in fact, some say theirexperience has been quite the opposite. Elaine Garzarelli,Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s top-rated stock-marketstrategist and one of Wall Street's best-known women, saysshe hasn't had any discrimination problems.   &quot;I think it's helped me being a woman, actually, on WallStreet,&quot; Ms. Garzarelli says. While women may have problemson trading desks, she says, in the research departments &quot;themen seem to respect us as doing a very tedious job and reallylooking at the details. Women tend to do that. . . . Womenare very service-oriented.&quot;   Ms. Garzarelli also suggests that women present fewer egoproblems for their bosses. She says women &quot;get a bonus andsay `Thank you,' and men say, `Whadaya mean? I deservemore.'&quot; For women on Wall Street, &quot;If you're good and you'resmart, you get respect.&quot;   But others suggest that in less beneficial ways, from thestart, many female job applicants are subjected to differentquestions than their male counterparts, often reflectingemployers' concerns that they might eventually favor familiesover their firms. In one particularly egregious case a fewyears ago, a Stanford University student said that a GoldmanSachs recruiter, Michael Werner, asked if she would &quot;have anabortion to save {her} job.&quot; Mr. Werner, who is no longer atGoldman, says he merely asked students whether they wouldadvise a friend to have an abortion, to see whether theywould &quot;go to the end of the world to be a professional.&quot;Goldman says the question was &quot;appalling&quot; and it disciplinedMr. Werner at the time.   Usually, however, Wall Street recruiters are a bit moresubtle. &quot;Companies want to know why a women isn't married, orif she is, why she'd want to spend so much time traveling,&quot;says Gary Goldstein, president of Whitney Group, an executivesearch firm specializing in the financial-services industry.   Once on the job, Wall Street women report an amazing rangeof offensive and even discriminatory practices, ranging fromthe mundane to the bizarre. One Wall Street investmentbanker, for instance, says she discovered she had beenpromised romantically to the principal in a deal her boss washoping to snag. The woman, like nearly every womaninterviewed with such grievances, asks not to be identified.   Sometimes, the offensive behavior seems almost designed tomake a female employee uncomfortable. One woman lawyer tellsof a meeting with a senior executive of Oppenheimer in themid-1980s. After 45 minutes, and in the presence of others,the executive said, &quot;You should have told me to turn down theair conditioning. Your nipples are sticking out.&quot; The lawyersays she was both embarrassed and angry, but didn't respond.Another woman at the firm who was present confirms theincident.   Frequently, female employees feel it too risky to theircareers to complain, let alone press charges. Lawyers whorepresent Wall Street women in sex discrimination cases saythat it is a rare woman who will stand up and publicly chargeshe has been harassed. &quot;You really do get blackballed in thesecurities industry,&quot; says Boston lawyer Beville May. &quot;It'ssuch an old-boys' network.&quot;   But when one former Merrill Lynch broker in Boston, TeresaContardo, took her case to court, she won a landmark victory,remarkable in its description of the kinds of pervasive butsubtle discrimination she had faced. After ordering Merrillto pay $250,000 in punitive damages for habituallydiscriminating against Mrs. Contardo last December, U.S.District Judge Walter Skinner said in a blistering opinion:&quot;There existed in the office a male `locker room' atmospherein which the male brokers engaged in lewd remarks and malebirthdays were celebrated in the office, in the presence ofcustomers, with . . . a birthday cake in the shape of aphallus.&quot; Merrill says it was &quot;disappointed&quot; with thedecision, but didn't appeal it.   While subtle put-downs seem commonplace, some womencomplain that crude sexual harassment still thrives, despiterecent efforts by Wall Street firms to stamp it out. Thisyear, according to the Equal Employment OpportunityCommission, a record 153 cases alleging sexual harassmenthave been filed against financial institutions, includingsecurities firms, up 50% from the 102 last year -- anincrease that could simply reflect greater awareness of thepossibility of legal remedies. Many more cases are settledthrough arbitration or quietly settled by brokerage firms'lawyers.   Lynn Jennings, a former administrative manager in Atlantaat J.C. Bradford andamp; Co., says she was fired after a series ofincidents involving a broker in her office, beginning whenthe broker grabbed her head &quot;and pulled it toward hiscrotch.&quot; Ms. Jennings, who sued her former employer inAugust, says she was subjected to a &quot;virtual campaign ofharassment.&quot;   For instance, Ms. Jennings said in the suit, filed inGeorgia state court, that at a lunch for brokers at thefirm's Atlanta office, broker Mark Hill invited her to &quot;geton the table and lie down,&quot; allegedly adding, &quot;I bet you'dlove that.&quot;   A. Lee Parks, Mr. Hill's attorney, denies Ms. Jennings'sallegations, and argues that &quot;everyone was laughing about thegigantic bowls of potato salad and cole slaw, which were sobig you could roll around in them.&quot; The lawyer says that &quot;noone took {Mr. Hill's comments} as sexual harassment.&quot;   Even before the recent pronouncements from the top firmsregarding their commitment to fighting sexual harassment,Wall Street has taken some steps in recent years to recruitmore women and promote some of them. Yet &quot;Wall Street is awomen-unfriendly environment,&quot; says Barbara Roberts, a formercapital markets executive and director of Dean WitterReynolds Inc., who left the industry and now heads theFinancial Women's Association of New York. &quot;If you're notcomfortable with a certain level of lewdness, you shouldn'tbe there.&quot;   But the larger issue, many women on Wall Street say, isthat some of the men who run the firms simply don't believethat women belong in high-powered jobs there. In a 1989article in M magazine, James Cayne, Bear Stearns's president,opined that there weren't many women selling stocks and bondsbecause, faced with rejection, a Wall Street woman would&quot;probably have to go to the ladies' room and dab her eyes.&quot;Now, an apologetic Mr. Cayne says Bear Stearns is &quot;100%committed&quot; to equal opportunity for women; like the otherfirms, Bear Stearns in recent days &quot;reiterated&quot; itsanti-harassment policies.   Some Wall Street executives claim women are largely toblame for their unequal status. One chief executive says thathis firm was losing nearly 50% of the women it hired out ofbusiness school and sought to promote, compared with only 4%of the men. He commissioned a study to determine why. Thewomen, he concluded, &quot;made life-style decisions,&quot; a euphemismfor having children and working fewer hours. &quot;The cost oftraining someone is high, and you might be more reluctant toinvest in a lot of women,&quot; he says.   &quot;Are there special considerations for a woman? Of coursethere are,&quot; says John Chalsty, chief executive of Donaldson,Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc. &quot;But if a woman is good enough, we'regoing to live with those. We've had a number of women herewho've left for a while, had children and arranged theirlives so they can handle dual careers.&quot; Mr. Chalsty himselfhas two daughters who gave up successful Wall Street careers.   And of course, there have been breakthroughs in the 24years since Muriel Siebert forged her way onto the New YorkStock Exchange's all-male roster, becoming its first femalemember.   In this year's ranking of Wall Street's securitiesanalysts published by Institutional Investor magazine, womenwon 16% of the top spots. Women analysts won 22 of the 51positions gained by American Express Co.'s Shearson LehmanBrothers unit in the magazine's widely followed ranking. Butthere are still no women in Shearson's executive managementgroup. (The firm is &quot;now beginning to develop a cadre of{women} who can move up,&quot; says personnel director Rusty Myer,Shearson's highest-ranking woman.)   Success for Wall Street women is becoming &quot;a more normalthing rather than the exception,&quot; says Abby Joseph Cohen, aprominent Goldman market strategist who is the firm's mostvisible woman. As for discrimination, she says, Wall Streetis &quot;too competitive a business to allow that kind of stuff togo on.&quot;   But Mrs. Cohen says that isn't the way it always was onWall Street. She recalls an analysts' meeting early in hercareer at New York's staid University Club, when the doormanlet all the men in but stopped her in her tracks. He saidwomen weren't allowed. Mrs. Cohen told the doorman she wasgoing inside anyway. &quot;If you want to stop me, go ahead,&quot; shetold him.   Mrs. Cohen was the only female analyst to attend themeeting that day.   Other women analysts say they are offended that analystmeetings continue to be held at the University Club, whichallows women now after losing a court fight.   Those who have made it to the top on Wall Street, likeSalomon Brothers managing director Jessica Palmer, who headsSalomon's big capital markets group, say that they have facedchallenges along the way that their male counterparts didn't.&quot;Does a chief executive want to take advice from a petitewoman?&quot; Mrs. Palmer asks, answering her own question. &quot;Notunless she's really good -- better than her male colleagues.&quot;   Mrs. Siebert, whose firm employs 50 people and is thelargest women-owned brokerage house, sums it up this way:&quot;Sure, we've made progress, but we still have a long way togo before Wall Street is a pro-women place.&quot;   Robin Spaman, a former Prudential broker, is a case inpoint. After she opened some 400 new accounts in 1989, shesays that male co-workers buzzed that &quot;the reason I opened somany accounts was because I gave free sex with everyaccount.&quot; Indignant, Mrs. Spaman notes, &quot;I'm a grandmother]&quot;and then adds, &quot;and frankly, I never did that.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
