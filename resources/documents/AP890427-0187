The $1.17 trillion plan, adopted by a bipartisan vote of 18-6,calls for new user fees, sales of government assets and $5.3billion in unspecified new revenue, while restraining spendinggrowth in defense and in some domestic areas.   The budget is designed to reduce the federal deficit next yearby roughly $27 billion to less than $100 billion, as required bythe Gramm-Rudman deficit law. However, even its sponsors describedit as only a modest accomplishment.   ``There's not a lot of deficit reduction in this package,'' saidRep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., senior Republican on the committee.   And committee chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said he hoped to``work toward a bolder resolution in the future.'' Panetta andFrenzel both participated in the White House talks, and jointlyoffered the budget adopted by the committee.   Earlier, at a breakfast meeting with reporters, Panetta saidCongress and the White House might have to seek more spending cutsor taxes as early as this summer if deficit estimates worsen in thenext few months.   Panetta, after the committee meeting, predicted the budget wouldpass the House next week. The Senate Budget Committee produced itsversion last week and full Senate action is also expected next week.   The $5.3 billion in new revenue called for in the White Housepact remains a matter of contention. Bush has insisted that ratherthan a tax increase the additional revenue would be raised bycutting the rate on capital gains income.   The chairmen of the House and Senate tax committees have givenBush's capital-gains proposal little chance of approval, but talkscontinue.   ``There's a five-point-three number hanging out there,'' Frenzelsaid.   A list of proposed user fees in the House committee version ofthe budget, obtained by reporters, includes new levies on a widerange of government services.   They include fees for inspection of imported foods, chargingfederal insurance fees for bank deposits held by foreigners,additional levies on the nuclear power industry, and new orextended charges for veterans' home loans and national floodinsurance.   The two current versions of the budget, which must be reconciledby the two chambers before the budget resolution becomes final, arenecessarily similar because of the White House agreement earlierthis month between Bush and congressional leaders.   Military spending in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 would beabout $299.2 billion, with total spending authority _ some of whichmay be spent after the end of the fiscal year _ of $305.5 billion.Foreign aid spending would be $16.7 billion.   Growth in the Medicare program would be trimmed about $2.7billion. There would be no cuts in Social Security benefits.   But while overall spending by federal agencies was set by theagreement, the House and Senate had slightly different priorities.   The Senate allocated more money for agriculture, energy,transportation and law enforcement programs while the House favoredspending on education, health and veterans, according to figuresreleased by the House panel. Bush, for the most part, did not spellout priorities among those programs, but he agreed in the deficitpact to increase them overall to keep pace with inflation.   Panetta and Frenzel said the House committee, unlike the Senatepanel, produced detailed recommendations on how money would bespent in each area. For examle, Frenzel said the extra money put inthe science and space category would allow Congress a chance tokeep alive both the space station and superconducting supercolliderscience projects.   Much of what the House committee decided was done behind closeddoors and not revealed during the public session. Those policychoices will be included in the committee report published nextweek.   The press release by the committee touted popular spending inthe package.   The budget would clear the way for new federal child care andchild health and education spending, paent's crimeinitiative with more money than he requested for the war on drugs,and provide $1.9 billion to fight AIDS, it said. Federal civilianand military employees wouldy for the presid get a 3.6 percent pay boost.   In its open session, the committee rejected an amendment by Rep.Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, to increase veterans' health spending $150million beyond what was approved in the private meetings. Panettasaid the committee level was still well above the level recommendedby Bush or passed by the Senate.   The budget does not itself authorize federal spending. It servesas the guideline for the annual spending and tax bills that gothrough Congress to the president.   If by Oct. 1 those bills don't reduce the fiscal 1990 deficit,as projected by the White House, to within $10 billion of theGramm-Rudman target of $100 billion, the administration must orderautomatic spending cuts to make0.29  0.401100      1.42  1.60  1.47  0.25  0.60  0.761200      0.80  1.12  1.05  0.65  1.09  1.341300      0.44  0.78  0.75  1.27  1.72  2.041400      0.24  0.51  0.57  2.07  2.38    s1500      0.14  0.38    s    r    s    sEstimated volume 4,591</TEXT><TEXT>   Prev. day calls vol. n-a Open int. 58,056</TEXT><TEXT>   Prev. day puts vol. n-a Open int. 25,965</TEXT></DOC>
