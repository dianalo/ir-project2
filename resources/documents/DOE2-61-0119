This is done within the framework of an electronic-mail system.Security is implemented by GEMSOS, the operating system of the GeminiTrusted Computer Base. A brief history of computer secrecy is followedby a discussion of security kernels. Event counts and sequences are usedto provide concurrency control and are covered in detail. The specificationsfor the system are based upon the requirements for a Headquarters ofa hypothetical Marine Battalion in garrison.</TEXT></DOC>
