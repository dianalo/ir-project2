At Bank of Boston Corp., officials were surprised at themildly upbeat mood of 300 corporate customers at a meeting inSpringfield, Mass., last Friday. They showed particularinterest in government guaranteed loans for inventorybuildup, for instance.</LP><TEXT>   In Kalamazoo, Mich., auto parts suppliers &quot;aren't cryingthe blues as they did last fall,&quot; says Thomas Leto, chairmanof the loan policy committee of First of America Bank Corp.He is already seeing a pickup in his loan demand.   And in a survey two weeks ago, CIT Group, a nationalcommercial finance company, found that 71% of 323 financialexecutives of medium-sized companies thought the economy willget better in the next six months.   At the same time, larger corporations have been gettinginto a stronger position to spend money by refinancing debtin the bond markets at a record pace and issuing new commonstock as well. And the private placement markets have beenmore accomodating in supplying credit to the upper end ofmedium-sized companies.   A pickup in corporate borrowing can be good for theeconomy because it usually means companies are preparing tospend money to get ready for more demand for their ownproducts and services. And while loan growth typically doesnot show up until an economic recovery is well on its way,this time may be different, say economists, becauseinventories are lower than usual at this stage of a recovery.   At the same time, there is less talk of a credit crunch.Bankers say they are more inclined to make loans, bothbecause they are feeling better about the economy and theyare beginning to see a stronger group of potential borrowers.   To be sure, there has yet to be an increase in loans onthe books of the nation's banks, although yesterday's datafrom the Federal Reserve Bank showed a modest increase incorporate loans at large New York City banks.   A number of bankers agree with Frank Lourenso, head ofmiddle market corporate lending at Chemical Banking Corp.,who says: &quot;My customer base is not prepared to say therecession is ended.&quot; Robert Bourke, senior vice president ofFirst Chicago Corp. says that while his loan volume is up abit, &quot;it's no groundswell by any stretch of the imagination.&quot;   But more and more bankers are starting to see glimmers ofhope. &quot;Although our numbers do not demonstrate a clear uptickin lending, our pipeline of deals is significantly betterthan six months ago,&quot; says Edgar Morsman, executive vicepresident of Norwest Bank, Minnesota. Some are for inventorybuildup, others to acquire or open new lines of business.   Albert Gamper, Jr., president of CIT, also is encouragedby a higher backlog of proposals under consideration. &quot;It'sstill not a healthy backlog, but its bigger than six monthsor a year ago,&quot; he says. There is $150 million of equipmentwaiting to be financed in one line of CIT's business; Mr.Gamper would feel better if it were $300 million, he says.   Even in New England, the hardest hit region of the pastfew years, &quot;some industries, such as the auto dealers andsome housing sectors, are starting to crawl out,&quot; says RobertMahoney, director of New England corporate banking for Bankof Boston. He says he is feeling &quot;significantly better&quot; aboutthe chance for an increase in lending than he did last summerbecause of fourth-quarter sales figures from the 5,000companies that are his bank's customers.   &quot;For the first time in a while, there were as manyincreases as decreases,&quot; Mr. Mahoney says. &quot;That's prettygood news because dollars of revenues are the best proxy forfuture lending.&quot; His department is reviewing the data alongwith budget forecasts since it is in the midst of itscredit-line renewal decisions.   Even jewelry companies, which depend on discretionaryspending, are forecasting better times, Mr. Mahoney says.Other bankers point out that the textile and apparel tradesare among the first to be lining up for new loans.   Mr. Mahoney says more and more companies have set stableexpense budgets for 1992, instead of a decline, as was thecase last year. Moreover, &quot;I'm not discounting those budgetsas I did last year. Mentally I'm buying into them,&quot; he says.He is expecting loan demand to stay flat through the secondquarter, with a modest rebound beginning after that.   Economist Maury Harris of PaineWebber Inc. is expecting apickup in loan demand because banks are no longer tighteningtheir lending criteria as much. Previously, the downturn inlending rates caused by the Federal Reserve was offset bybank tightening. But in the latest Fed survey of senior loanofficers of five dozen large banks, there was virtually notightening between October and January, when there was a 1.5percentage point drop in the prime rate, he says.   &quot;If you just stop tightening every time rates go down,that helps,&quot; says Mr. Harris.   Banks should be wary, however, of overreaching, warnsChristopher Snyder, president of Loan Pricing Corp. Withoutfurther cuts in interest rates, many banks may scramble toboost earnings in the second and third quarters by loweringlending criteria and shaving fees, he says.   At the end of the 1982 recession, many banks were tooeager to get back on track, he says, giving birth to highlyleveraged lending and increasing exposure in agriculturalland, energy and less-developed country lending, withdisastrous consequences for some. &quot;At times like these,questionable or dangerous lending patterns can be spawned,&quot;he cautions.   Businesses can be just as misguided, says Mr. Leto ofFirst of America Bank. Over the past 20 years, he has seen anumber of auto-supply companies &quot;implode when they come outof a recession in a weakened condition and try to buildinventory too fast.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
