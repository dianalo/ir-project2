DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sir James Goldsmith is taking up the cudgelagain against critics of his multibillion-dollar hostile takeoverbid for Britain's BAT Industries PLC, the world's largest tobaccocompany, and its U.S. affiliates.   Goldsmith, in a statement issued from London on Thursday, labeledcriticism by U.S. unions and Kentucky Gov. Wallace G. Wilkinson asexamples of ``extensive lobbying'' by U.S. tobacco interests.   The Anglo-French financier last month launched a $21.6 billionbid for the company along with British merchant banker JacobRothschild and Australian investor Kerry Packer.   In Washington on Thursday, union officials held a news conferenceto charge that the takeover would jeopardize the jobs of 55,000American workers.   ``Where his takeovers have been successful, Goldsmith hasdismantled companies, sold off assets, closed down plants and raidedpension funds. In each case, workers have paid a heavy price,'' saidJohn DeConcini, president of the Bakery, Confectionery and TobaccoWorkers International Union.   Also Thursday, Wilkinson met with BAT chairman Patrick Sheehy inLondon to offer his help in thwarting the takeover.   Wilkinson said he expressed concern about the impact of atakeover on the 1,500 Kentuckians who work for BAT subsidiaries aswell as on 100,000 Kentucky tobacco farmers.   BAT's U.S. subsidiary, Louisville, Ky.-based BATUS Inc., overseesBrown andamp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., which employs more than 5,000people.   Goldsmith, meanwhile, reiterated earlier statements that amongU.S. companies he has acquired, ``there are presently significantlymore people employed in the aggregate than prior to the time of theacquisition.''   The cashless offer for BAT by Hoylake Investments Ltd. would befinanced largely through money borrowed against the concern'sexisting assets, known as a leveraged buyout.   The group has said it intends to sell the non-tobacco businessesof BAT, which also has significant interests in financial services,paper and retailing _ including such U.S. holdings as Saks FifthAvenue and Marshall Field department stores and Farmers InsuranceGroup.   Union officials concede there is no absolute proof a Goldsmithtakeover would result in layoffs, but Rudy Oswald of the AFL-CIOsaid Thursday that corporate mergers, takeovers and leveragedbuyouts have cost more than 90,000 union workers their jobs since1980.   Union officials listed 30 such corporate actions _ includingGoldsmith's aborted 1986 bid for Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. andhis successful takeover of the James River paper company in 1985 _they say cost thousands their jobs.   The list included BATUS' closing of the Gimbels department storechain, which union officials said cost 5,000 jobs.   Goldsmith said in his statement that the only jobs at risk underhis BAT takeover proposal were those held by senior companyofficials in London.   More than 200 members of Congress last week signed a letterurging Secretary of State James A. Baker III to express concern tothe British government about the multinational leveraged buyout.</TEXT></DOC>
