Each year, 3.2 million nature-seekersdescend into the park. But the bulk of these visitors crowd in during thesummer months, over half a million in August alone. That leaves the coldermonths to those, like Muir, who come seeking solitude, to be overwhelmed bynature's grandeur far away from the distractions of civilization.;    &quot;Offseason&quot; is a misnomer for the time of year when swirling leaves mark theMerced River's passage, towering evergreens defy the cold, snow highlights thefacets of Half Dome, and woodsy smoke curls invitingly from cabin chimneys.Perhaps the waterfalls are not the torrents of spring, and the evening weatheroften necessitates a down jacket, scarf and mittens, but savvy visitors willlearn to use the off season to their advantage.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Travel  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LEAVE THE CROWDS BEHIND AND STRAP ON THESNOWSHOES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Discovering CaliforniaYosemite in WinterFree-lance writer Pamela Hegarty lives in Hercules.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Lodging is more available and generally costs less, discounted up to 45percent midweek. Rangers lead bargain-priced snowshoe walks. California's onlyoutdoor ice skating rink is open until 10 p.m. And specialized, freedemonstrations by renowned area chefs and vintners feature everything fromexotic mushrooms to decadent desserts -- including tastings.;    The bestpanorama of Yosemite Valley is from the Tunnel View at the Highway 41entrance. Below, tucked into five miles of  pure inspiration, is America'sShangri-la -- the &quot;domes and gables, spires and battlements,&quot; as described byMuir, that persuaded Teddy Roosevelt to designate Yosemite as a National Parkin October 1890.;    As you descend into the valley, stop first at BridalveilFalls. Watch for the sign on your right and walk the half-mile from theparking lot to the base of the falls. In winter, Bridalveil is a whisper,rather than the thunder of spring, a lacy train 620 feet, or more than 50stories, long.;    As you continue along the one-way road, Yosemite's nextsuperlative towers above you. El Capitan, a massive, 3,593-foot monolith, isas domineering as its name, the largest single granite rock on Earth. Shadowsof clouds set off patterns of light on its slopes, an ever-changing show.;   Yosemite's most distinctive mountain majesty, however, is Half Dome. For thebest view of this brooding rock visage, make a quick stop by the first MercedRiver bridge. Park and walk to the center of the bridge. Here you will see theclassic reflection of Half Dome in the Merced River. Photographers take note-- the best time of day for this unbeatable shot is just before sunset, whenthe river waters are still and Half Dome glows with a pinkish gold.;    Fromevery direction, Sierra rivers plummet into the valley. Some falls are deepwithin the woods, accessible only to hardy hikers. But the park's moststunning cascade, Yosemite Falls, is a short walk from Yosemite Lodge.;   Yosemite Falls is actually three waterfalls, a powerful chain of water twicethe height of the Empire State Building. From the granite ridge high aboveyou, Upper Fall drops 1,430 feet straight down. The Cascades, or Middle Fall,tumble over another 675 feet, pouring into the steep, 320-foot drop of theLower Fall. Often, a rainbow arches over the base of Yosemite Falls, markingthe gateway between falls and forest.;    Cross the bridge here to follow theoften-overlooked, mile-long loop trail back to the parking lot. The path windsthrough dappled forest; a series of bridges cross the icy streams. Deep withinthe shadow of redwoods, you will find the site of John Muir's cabin, where helived off the land with Yosemite Falls as his backdrop.;    For another easywinter hike, follow the level, 1.2-mile trail to Mirror Lake. For hardierhikers, a one-mile, strenuous climb leads to a bridge overlooking VernalFalls. You can continue up this trail to the top of Nevada Falls, but beprepared for icy conditions and a full day's hiking.;    Before heading out onany day hike, check at the visitor center for trail and weather conditions.And take the time to view the geology and history exhibits in the center. Inback of the building, a re-created Ahwahneechee Indian village tells the storyof Yosemite's first residents.;    Also at the visitor center, you can findout about scheduled activities. The rangers often present evening talks andslide shows on various aspects of the park. On certain days, you can join oneof their nature hikes. For something extra special, ask about the ranger-ledsnowshoe hikes through the upper elevations at Badger Pass Ski Area (seerelated story).;    The snowshoe walk is informative, fun and priced right --$1 for the maintenance of the shoes. Snowshoes take a bit of getting used to,but anyone who can walk can snowshoe. Because of the altitude, the rangermakes a series of breath-catcher stops to talk about Yosemite's plant andanimal life in winter. Ultimately, you will reach an outstanding view ofYosemite's high country peaks, some of them 35 miles away.;    From Novemberto January, Yosemite Park and Curry Co. celebrates its Vintners' and Chefs'Holidays during the less busy midweek days. Renowned wine and food expertsoffer free demonstrations and tastings. Many of the cooks provide recipes totry at home.;    Each of the sessions is followed by a multicourse dinnercreated by the featured gourmet. The dinners are unique, served in thecandlelit grand dining hall of the Ahwahnee Hotel, but somewhat pricey.;   The most tangible benefit of visiting Yosemite in the off season, however, isthe greater availability and lower cost of lodging. Even the exclusiveAhwahnee Hotel is discounted almost 10 percent during the winter midweek, withdouble rooms priced around $174. Those on a budget can get a cabin withoutbath, but with electric heater, for $22.50, about 45 percent off in-seasonrates. And, while summer visits require reservations months in advance, youcan conceivably find lodging the day you arrive in winter, or at least with afew days' notice. Of course, you are strongly urged to make reservations aheadof time. (Some rates are due to change in mid-February and others in March, socall to confirm.);    Whether you are seeking solitude, extraordinary naturalbeauty or a unique learning experience, you will find it in Yosemite in theoff season.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PAMELA P.
