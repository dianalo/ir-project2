Most of these factorshave a direct relationship to the future net revenues and payout times.However, the corresponding effect of changes in these parameters on thegross reserves is quite often buried beneath the surface of associatedchanges in future revenues. Even though the estimates of gross reservesthat could be recovered may not change for a particular well, the economicgross reserves and associated future revenues could change dramaticallydue to economic and/or operating conditions. An increase, or decrease,in pricing and/or operating costs can alter the volume of oil or gasreserves which are reported. When reserves reports are prepared, it isnecessary that the oil and gas producer understands the relationshipbetween gross reserves and economic gross reserves as presented herein.The purpose of this paper is to further investigate and define the effectthat changes in economic factors, especially pricing, have on the calculationof economic gross reserves. Three typical Appalachian Basin reservoirs(Clinton, Big Lime, and shallow oil productive sand) are used in thispaper to depict the effects of changes in economic conditions. Variationsin operating conditions such as curtailments are also briefly addressedto examine associated changes in future revenues and payout times.</TEXT></DOC>
