The corporation has said it will run out of money within days.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  Sandamp;L BAILOUT FUNDS REJECTED  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     A similar $30 billion bill written by majorities of both parties on theHouse Banking Committee and supported by the Bush administration failed on a220-201 House vote Tuesday night. Democrats rejected it by a 177-81 margin;Republicans favored it, 120-42; the only independent voted against it.;   That vote followed defeat of two other options -- one written by each party --that would have imposed varying degrees of management and reportingrequirements on the RTC.;    In addition, the House rejected a fourth plan,which would prohibit borrowing to make future bailout payments. This wouldrequire the administration to recommend tax increases or spending cuts to keepthe bailout going.;    The votes reflected a general concern in Congress thatvoters are unhappy with the whole Sandamp;L mess, which has become the biggestfinancial scandal in the nation's history. Estimates of the ultimate taxpayercost of bailing out depositors in failed institutions run as high as $500billion.;    Meanwhile, &quot;the meter is running, another $8 million a day&quot; inadditional costs are accumulating because of the delay, Peter Monroe,president of the board that oversees the RTC, said after the votes.;    &quot;We'veprotected 12 million depositors with average account balances of $10,000 sofar,&quot; Monroe said. &quot;We can't continue to close thrifts without the money.&quot;;   Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking Committee, said hecould think of few things &quot;as distasteful, as politically unpalatable&quot; asvoting more money for the bailout.;    In the end, Gonzalez's own $30 billionplan, which would have imposed several social &quot;reforms&quot; on the corporation,was rejected by a 303-121 vote.;    The Republican option would haveeliminated those requirements, including those setting a goal of having 25percent of contracts of the bailout agency given to women and minorities andmaking it easier for lower- and middle-income people to buy housing acquiredby the RTC.;    Republicans argued that attaching such social provisions tothe legislation would make the bailout even more expensive.;    Gonzalez andseveral other Democrats said it would be unfair to taxpayers to allow the RTC-- which already has spent nearly $50 billion in tax money -- to continueoperating without some reforms.;    &quot;The RTC has done a miserable job,&quot; saidRep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., who heads the House Banking subcommittee onfinancial institutions. He said the agency should be forced to expedite thesale of the remaining $150 billion of assets it still holds from failed Sandamp;Ls.;   In addition to the $50 billion already spent and the $30 billioncontemplated for reimbursing depositors in the next 6 1/2 months, the RTC isborrowing $100 billion on its own. That money will be repaid once the assetsof failed institutions are sold.;    After the House had rejected all fouravailable options Tuesday night, Gonzalez accused the administration ofrefusing to compromise on any Democratic demands. &quot;Republicans have fouledtheir own nest,&quot; he said.;    Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., noted that Democrats,who control the House, offered no plan that was acceptable to a majority. &quot;Theadministration has no votes on this floor,&quot; he said. &quot;It is up to us to do ourjob.&quot;;    Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, accused members of both parties ofplaying politics with the issue.;    &quot;It was an easy vote to be against heRTC,&quot; he said. &quot;You have failed to follow the leadership of the president andleaders of both parties. And you have frightened depositors.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910313  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  648  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday March 13, 199100073143,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
