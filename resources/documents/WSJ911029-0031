Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) andSen. Wendell Ford (D., Ky.) appeared to have headed off aneffort by Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) to extend thepending job-bias measure to Senate employees. Currently,members of Congress are exempted from severalantidiscrimination laws that relate to employment, eventhough these laws apply to the executive branch.</LP><TEXT>   Several senators object strongly to subjecting themselvesto job-bias lawsuits on the grounds that they would violatethe constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. An aideto Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.) said last week that ifCongress were subject to certain civil rights laws, it mightresemble &quot;the days when the crown used to regularly arrestmembers of Parliament on the way to meet.&quot;   But coming at a time when Congress's reputation istarnished by the House check-overdraft scandal and theSenate's clumsy handling of sexual harassment charges duringthe Supreme Court nomination of Clarence Thomas, much of theSenate feared voting against Mr. Grassley's amendment. Theprospect of avoiding the issue head-on is likely to causesenators enormous relief.   Last night, Sens. Mitchell and Ford appeared to havebrokered a compromise in which Senate employees could bringjob-bias complaints to a newly created office in the Senate.A similar office is in operation for employees of the Houseof Representatives.   Details of the compromise amendment were being worked outlate last night. But an aide to Sen. Ford said that under thecompromise, Senate employees who weren't satisfied with theSenate's internal resolution of job-bias complaints would beeligible for some sort of redress in the courts.   According to a Senate aide, that redress would come in theform of review by the U.S. Court of Appeals, which wouldappear to eliminate the possibility of a jury trial. UnderSen. Grassley's original proposal, any Senate employeesuffering job discrimination would have access to a jury.Private employers are subject to enforcement by the EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission and can be sued in court bytheir employees.   Access to jury-awarded punitive damages for victims of sexand disability-related employment discrimination was a majorpoint of contention in negotiations over the bill, with civilrights groups advocating juries while the White House andmany Senate Republicans favored having judges make theawards.   President Bush publicly weighed in on the issue in aspeech last Thursday, when he called on Congress to &quot;submitto the laws it imposes on others, including strictenforcement provisions.&quot;   Separately, an aide to Sen. Timothy Wirth (D., Colo.) saidthe senator wouldn't introduce an amendment to lift caps onpunitive damages for victims of discrimination based on sexor disability. Instead, she said Sen. Wirth would introduce aseparate bill, and that Sen. Mitchell agreed to bring it upearly next year.</TEXT></DOC>
