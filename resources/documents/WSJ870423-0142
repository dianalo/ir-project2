The measures also will restrict, and potentially ban, smoking in federal departments and federally regulated companies, including banks, airlines and broadcasting and telephone companies.    Federal Health Minister Jake Epp said the program shows the government's commitment to reduce cigarette smoking, which he called Canada's &quot;leading preventable health problem.&quot; Mr. Epp plans to introduce legislation this spring to implement the measures.    Public opinion polls have shown that more than 60% of Canadians favor a ban on cigarette advertising. With its large parliamentary majority, the Progressive Conservative government won't have any difficulty passing the measures into law.    Among other measures, the government said it will ban tobacco advertising in newspapers by the end of this year and in magazines by Jan. 1, 1989. It will also ban by 1989 billboard advertising and most sponsorship by tobacco companies. Stronger health warnings, more prominently displayed, will be required on cigarette packages.    Penalties for breaking the law will include fines of as much as $100,000 (Canadian) or a six-month jail sentence for the first offense.    Smoking will be restricted to special smoking areas by the end of this year in federal government departments and agencies and federally regulated companies. And the government intends to ban smoking entirely in federal government workplaces by January 1989.    Keith B. McKerracher, president of the Institute of Canadian Advertising, said about $88 million (Canadian) is spent annually on advertising and promotion of tobacco products, out of $7 billion spent in Canada on all publicity for all products.    James Warrillow, Maclean Hunter Ltd.'s senior vice president, Canadian publishing, said he disapproved of the advertising ban because &quot;a product that is legal to sell should be legal to advertise.&quot; He noted that Canadian consumers will still be subjected to tobacco advertising because U.S. magazines, which will continue to carry tobacco ads, account for 50% of all magazines sold in Canada.    Mr. Warrillow said the impact of the measure will be &quot;negligible&quot; on the Toronto-based publishing and broadcasting concern because only about 0.1% of its revenue comes from tobacco advertising.    The Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Association said it will hold a news conference today, and declined to comment on the government action until then. A spokesman for Imasco Ltd., parent of Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Canada's largest tobacco manufacturer, declined to comment.    According to government statistics, Canada ranks as one of the top 10 countries in per capita cigarette consumption, and 36% of its citizens smoke. Health Minister Epp said he was particularly concerned about the continuing increase in numbers of young women smokers.    Several government departments and agencies already have restricted smoking in the workplace. Air Canada, the government-owned airline, last year banned smoking on some short-distance flights, a step that has proved popular with most passengers.    Mr. Epp said government tax revenue from tobacco products totals &quot;just under $2 billion&quot; annually. He said the decrease in that revenue resulting from the government's moves to discourage smoking would be more than made up by savings in health costs to Canada's universal medicare system. About 90% of deaths from chronic obstructive lung disease, 30% from heart disease and 30% from cancer are caused by tobacco use, the government said. </TEXT></DOC>
