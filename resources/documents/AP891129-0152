Elias Hrawi, the new Christian president backed by Syria,dismissed Aoun as army commander Tuesday and ordered him to leavehis command post in a bunker beneath the presidential palace inBaabda, east of Beirut.   Aoun claims Hrawi's election by Parliament last week wasunconstitutional, says he won't accept a new peace plan until theSyrian ``occupation army'' leaves the country, and has refused toturn over the shell-battered palace.   Lebanon's largest Christian militia, the Lebanese forces, saidit would fight beside the 20,000 Christian troops who followed Aounthrough a six-month artillery war with the Syrians earlier thisyear.   The Phalange Party, the main right-wing Christian politicalforce and also a foe of Aoun, pledged to confront any attempt tostorm the 310-square-mile Christian enclave north and east ofBeirut.   Thirty-three members of the French parliament met with Aoun. Ina show of support that contradicted the official French governmentstand, the legislators joined thousands of young men who haveformed a human shield around the palace.   One of the lawmakers, Bernard Bosson, said he was ``amazed atthe flood of masses'' at the palace and declared: ``This is likethe people's movement in Eastern Europe asking for democracy.''   France supports Hrawi, who is trying to strengthen his centralgovernment and reunite the fractured military as part of an effortto end the 14-year-old sectarian civil war, in which more than150,000 people have been killed.   Christians have dominated the government, army and judiciarysince Lebanon became independent of France in 1943.   Residents of Chtoura, an east Lebanon market town on theDamascus-Beirut road, said Wednesday afternoon that scores of 122mmand 133mm Syrian artillery pieces were moving toward Beirut and thecentral mountains above Baabda, followed by dozens of trucks filledwith ammunition.   They said hundreds of empty trucks were heading back towardSyria, apparently after unloading soldiers and equipment.   Earlier, the residents reported seeing at least 15,000 soldiersin 800 trucks roll into Lebanon through the Bekaa Valley betweenMonday night and midday Tuesday, along with 90 tanks, 120 fieldguns, mine-clearing tanks, armored personnel carriers andammunition trucks.   Both Christian and Moslem military sources said Syria hadSoviet-designed T-55 tanks arrayed on the line that separatesMoslem west Beirut from the capital's Christian sector.   Larger T-62 tanks formed an ``arch of fire'' pointed at Aoun'stroops in Souk el-Gharb, a mountaintop town that commands the mainroutes to Baabda.   A Christian source said: ``They are in combat formation. Itseems they are only waiting for the orders. It's a significantbuildup, the kind of measures that precede a major battle.''   Samir Geagea, commander of the Lebanese Forces militia, said:``I ordered our forces last night to be ready to link up with theircomrades of the Lebanese army in defense of the liberated areas,''a reference to the 30 percent of Lebanon free of Syrian troops.   Syria has 40,000 soldiers regularly stationed in Lebanon under apeacekeeping mandate from the Arab League issued in 1976, the yearafter the civil war began. The Arab League arranged a cease-fireSept. 22 in the battle between Aoun and the Syrians, in whichnearly 1,000 civilians were killed.   Aoun's soldiers drove the 6,000 Lebanese Forces militiamen fromeast Beirut in a power struggle that culminated in a 4-dayconfrontation in February that killed 82 people and wounded 200.   A statement from the Phalange Party said: ``This is the hour formobilizing all potential without exception to face any attempt tostorm the Christian area. We shall be in the forward defenselines.''   The Phalange and Aoun parted company on the the peace planworked out by Lebanese legislators worked out in October at Taif,Saudi Arabia. The Phalange supports the plan, but Aoun rejected itbecause it did not include a fixed timetable for Syrian withdrawalfrom Lebanon.   Information Minister Edmond Rizk, a Phalangist, said in anappeal to Aoun on Tuesday: ``We all ask you to prove that youreally love Lebanon. ... Allow peace to prevail. You must rest andlet the nation rest.''   A Christian military source said Aoun's forces had plantedthousands of anti-tank and anti-personnel mines in valleys thatseparate the Christian enclave from Syrian positions.</TEXT></DOC>
