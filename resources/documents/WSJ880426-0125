Hauser </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> Portland, Ore.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The first day of spring began here like any other day, except that there were 29 people at the foot of Southwest Salmon Street each holding a 30-by-54-inch chinook salmon banner. Starting from the west bank of the Willamette River, they carried the muslin banners, making them leap and dive, nine blocks up the street to a new restaurant in town, where the banners were then hung from the ceiling.    The people, led by painter Roger Long, were pretending that the salmon were real and that they were making a spring run up Salmon Street. It was a natural progression for Mr. Long, who is so attuned to salmon and their significance to life in the Pacific Northwest that he has even re-invented the alphabet for the purpose of writing &quot;salmon talk.&quot;    This was the fourth year in a row that Mr. Long celebrated the chinook salmon's spring run up the Columbia River by slathering a few of the huge beauties with acrylic paint to make Japanese-style fish prints, or &quot;gyotaku.&quot;    Mr. Long has been a painter for 35 years. For 14 years, until 1978, he and his wife, Jean, a ceramicist, owned a local art gallery. Four years ago, seeking a change of pace, he took a part-time job as a room-service waiter at Portland's Heathman Hotel. But he didn't give up painting or his new-found passion for gyotaku. In fact, each year Mr. Long has been able to talk the hotel's head chef out of the biggest and freshest chinook salmon delivered each spring to the hotel's kitchen. His first salmon prints were framed on Japanese rice paper, but last year, in honor of the chef's wedding, he tried something new, making his salmon prints on muslin banners.    The chef saw that all those painted chinooks over the years had been a great investment. When he was put in charge of a new restaurant/brew pub opened by the hotel this year, he commissioned Mr. Long to produce 29 salmon banners for the restaurant's decor.    Four huge, fresh chinooks, prize catches from the first days of the spring run in February, were put at Mr. Long's disposal. For three nights in a row he worked overtime in the restaurant's kitchen -- from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. -- spreading out fish and muslin on the stainless-steel counters.    The first step was to wash the fish until they no longer felt, well, fishy. Then he packed the fish cavity with plastic bags full of ice to maintain freshness. (After all, somebody would be eating his models when he was done with them.)    Next, he placed foil under the fins and tail and propped open the mouth with a crumpled-up ball of foil. He fanned out the tail with the help of straight pins. Then he applied the paint, water-soluble acrylics in shades of green or grayish blue on the back and sides, rosy hues for the belly. Quickly removing the foil, he then pressed framed sheets of muslin over the fish, spreading the fabric with his hands or a roller.    The next few weeks were spent doing detail work with a paintbrush, applying gold foil to the eyes, and writing his vertical &quot;salmon talk&quot; messages underneath. Also, he carved salmon heads on the ends of five-foot Douglas fir dowels, from which the salmon banners hang.    As soon as the printing was finished, Mr. Long cleaned the fish thoroughly, then turned his almost-good-as-new models back to the chef. The chef then took the extra precaution of skinning the fish before smoking it. Diners then had the extra pleasure of seeing images of their once and future meal wafting over their heads while waiting for a smoked salmon sandwich (with a side of soup and salad).    From a distance, &quot;salmon talk&quot; looks like Japanese, but the artist means it to reflect his vision of life as upright, symmetrical and balanced. Each print bears his name, the name of his patron chef, the name of the hotel and the name of the restaurant -- all in &quot;salmon talk.&quot; A few prints have extra messages etched along their borders, such as &quot;I am the chinook scout to the first spring run on Portland's Salmon Street.&quot;    The only drawback is that Mr. Long is the one non-salmon who is literate in salmon talk. Nevertheless, patrons of the restaurant have been reeling in the salmon prints at $500 a fish ($750 for a two-fish banner).    &quot;In the Northwest,&quot; Mr. Long says, &quot;life has always revolved around the salmon runs. This is our food, this is our content, this is the communication of what we stand for.&quot;    A salmon couldn't have said it better.    ---   Ms. Hauser is a free-lance writer based in Portland. </TEXT></DOC>
