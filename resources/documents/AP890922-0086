(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Followers of television evangelist JimBakker said they were happy they paid $1,000 for partnerships in hisministry and didn't think he belonged in court.   Elizabeth Sacco, a former PTL employee who was laid off in 1986,testified Thursday that she's still loyal to Bakker ``and I'm proudof it. I feel loyalty because I've seen what this man built. Agreedy man doesn't have his hair turn gray in five years.   ``I wouldn't have taken his job for $10 million a year.''   Ms. Sacco, who answered correspondence for the ministry, was oneof the first witnesses to testify for Bakker as the defense phase ofthe 3{-week-old fraud trial got under way. Today's session of thetrial, however, was canceled after the remnants of Hurricane Hugobattered the city, cutting off power to most buildings and downingtrees that blocked many streets.   Bakker is charged with overselling the $1,000 lifetimepartnerships _ which bought their owners three nights of lodgingeach year for life _ and diverting $3.7 million of the proceeds tofinance his lavish lifestyle.   If convicted of all 24 fraud and conspiracy counts, Bakker couldface 120 years in prison and more than $5 million in fines.   Prosecution witnesses had testified they had difficulty bookingrooms at PTL's Heritage USA theme park near Fort Mill, S.C. Thegovernment alleges that Bakker sold more than twice as manypartnerships as there was room for at the park.   James Johnson, who bought eight partnerships in Bakker's church,said he always was able to get reservations when he called PTL, anddidn't believe the partnerships were oversold.   ``The only regret I have is that I don't think this should havebeen brought before this court,'' Johnson said. ``The church shouldhave taken care of it.''   Louise Grimes, who operates a gas station in Hopkins, S.C., saidthe money she sent to PTL for six partnerships was well spent.   She said she had used the partnerships several times to bookrooms at the Heritage Grand Hotel, sometimes visiting with hergrandchildren.   Under questioning by defense attorney George T. Davis, shedescribed the atmosphere at Heritage USA.   ``I want to say it's heavenly, but I don't know what heaven islike,'' she said. ``I can tell you that people were happy there.''   ``It did not take a mastermind to see that Jim and Tammy weretelling the truth,'' Atlanta builder and businessman Sam Gasawaytestified, referring to Bakker and his wife. ``The purpose of theministry is to reach out and help people.''   ``I found them to be upright people, truthful in what theysaid,'' Gasaway said. ``They're not the kind of people who should beaccused of what they are accused of.''</TEXT></DOC>
