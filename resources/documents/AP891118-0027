The House, which would still get the bigger pay boost, thenshipped the bill approved by voice vote early today to PresidentBush for his expected signature.   The Senate approved its plan 56-43 only hours after it seemed tobe ready to accept the House-passed package. The Senate left inplace the raises of more than 35 percent for the House, federaljudges and top government executives.   ``I believe it to be an unwise decision for the Senate,'' saidSenate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, not o adopt thefull pay raise and accompanying ban on speech honoraria in theHouse plan.   When it became apparent he didn't have the votes, Mitchellproposed, as a fallback, that the Senate take a raise of only 9.9percent, or about $8,900, for itself, billed as a cost-of-livingadjustment. Both chambers now make $89,500 a year.   With the smaller raise, the House bill's key ethics provision _elimination of speech honoraria in 1991 _ would take place moreslowly for the Senate.   The Senate decision would mean different salaries for the Senateand House, with the Senate earning more at first and the Housepassing it later.   That would be unusual but not unprecedented. From Dec. 21, 1982to July 1, 1983, the Senate was paid $60,662 and the House $69,800.   The final Senate action came only short while after the Senate,by a vote of 65-34, had killed a move by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,strip the pay raise provisions from the bill as passed by the House.   The House approved a bill Thursday under which congressional payshould soar from the current $89,500 to at least $120,800 andprobably closer to $125,000 by Jan. 1, 1991. An initialcost-of-living raise of only 7.9 percent was in that version.   Mitchell and Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas argued throughthe day for the Senate to take the full raise.   ``If the voters in our states look at what we do, if we workhard, have a complete disclosure of our assets, our speaking fees,then they can make the final judgment,'' Dole said.   ``The need for Congress to come to grips with the ethics issueis evident. Public opinion demands it,'' said Mitchell.   Helms argued that the bill was being ``rammed through.'' Thepublic won't accept the argument that ethics can be reformed onlyif members get more pay, he said.   ``Mr. Joe Lunchbucket is going to stand there and thumb his noseat any congressman who says that,'' he said.   Even as they were announcing their intentions on Fridayafternoon to follow the House example, Senate leaders were stilldrafting their version of the legislation.   With President Bush's support, the House voted 252-174 onThursday to raise its pay and that of other top governmentofficials for the first time since early 1987.   Their pay would increase at least 35 percent in less than 14months. If rank-and-file civil servants receive a cost-of-livingadjustment for fiscal 1991, as they usually do, that would be addedand the total raise would be more like 40 percent.   With the higher pay, lawmakers would be barred, beginning in1991, from earning extra income by making speeches before interestgroups. Other outside earned income generally would be limited to15 percent of their salaries and public disclosure would beincreased.   The Senate amended the ethics portion of the House plan torestrict post-employment lobbying by lawmakers and the president'stop aides.   No lobbying anywhere in the legislative branch would be allowedfor one year. Cabinet-level officials at the White House would alsoface a similar ban on lobbying in their branch of government,according to the provisions drafted by Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich.,and Warren Rudman, R-N.H.   Dole said the ``revolving door'' provision was especiallyimportant, and that senators should accept the plan even though theban on speech fees would for many make a cut in their income.Senators are now allowed to add to their earnings by 40 percentwith speaking fees.   ``This isn't really a pay raise. ... It's sort of a transfer,''he said. ``Instead of coming from the private sector, fromhonoraria, it's going to be coming from the Treasury.''   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., a leader of the successful fightagainst a proposed 51 percent congressional pay raise early thisyear, said eliminating the ``tawdry'' system of interest-grouphonoraria won his support for the new plan.   In addition to banning honoraria, the legislation would put newrestrictions on gifts and free travel lawmakers can accept frompeople outside of family.   The legislation also would end in 1993 the ability of Housemembers elected before 1980 to, upon retirement, transfer forpersonal use the balance of their campaign treasuries.</TEXT></DOC>
