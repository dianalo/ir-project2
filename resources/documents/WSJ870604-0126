Dec. 21, 1982, to Dec. 7, 1983. Defense Appropriation Act: No funds can be used by the Defense Department or Central Intelligence Agency &quot;to furnish military equipment, military training or advice . . . for the purpose of overthrowing the government of Nicaragua or provoking a military exchange between Nicaragua and Honduras.&quot;    Boland 2. Dec. 8, 1983, to Oct. 21, 1984. Defense Appropriations and Intelligence Authorization Acts: Granted $24 million for use by Defense, the CIA or other intelligence agencies for &quot;supporting, directly or indirectly, military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua.&quot;    Boland 3. Oct. 3, 1984, to Sept. 30, 1985. Defense Appropriation and Intelligence Authorization Acts: &quot;During fiscal year 1985, no funds available to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, or any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities may be obligated or expended for the purpose or which would have the effect of supporting, directly or indirectly, military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by any nation, group, organization, movement, or individual.&quot;    Boland 4. Aug. 8, 1985, to March 31, 1986. International Security and Development Cooperation Act: Appropriated $27 million for humanitarian assistance to the Contras via the State Department. It prohibited the U.S. government from entering &quot;into any arrangement conditioning, expressly or impliedly, the provision of assistance by a recipient to persons or groups engaging in an insurgency or other act of rebellion.&quot; Supplemental Appropriations Act: Granted exception from any prohibitions on the U.S. government &quot;exchanging information with the Nicaraguan democratic resistance.&quot;    Boland 5. Dec. 4, 1985, to Oct. 17, 1986. Intelligence Authorization Act: Authorized secret direct military and paramilitary aid to the Contras. The details were classified as national secrets, but the conference managers for the bill explained that the act authorized a classified amount for communications and equipment training. It also authorized intelligence agencies to help the Contras with intelligence and counterintelligence advice and information and communications training, but assistance (except for communications training) could not amount to &quot;planning or execution of military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua&quot; or &quot;participation in logistics activities integral to such activities.&quot; It repealed the prohibition on indirect military or paramilitary aid, and expressly authorized the State Department to solicit third country humanitarian aid.    Bolands 1-5 expired. On June 26, 1986, the House voted 221-209 to join the Senate in approving $100 million in aid for the Contras. Of this, $70 million was for military aid, $30 million for humanitarian aid.    (See related story: &quot;Boland Laws May Be the Real 'Crime'&quot; -- WSJ June 4, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
