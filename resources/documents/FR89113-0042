The proposal would add a provisio to the regulations thatany such products exported to another country and returned to the UnitedStates would be subject to detention in accordance with section 402 ofthe Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) or section 19 of the Poultry ProductsInspection Act (PPIA) and to seizure and condemnation in accordance withsection 403 of the FMIA or section 20 of the PPIA. This proposed rule isnecessary specifically to provide that such products are subject to administrativedetention and judicial seizure and condemnation as authorized under theActs.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before March 14, 1989.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Written comments to: Policy Office, Attn: Linda Carey,FSIS Hearing Clerk, Room 3171_South Agriculture Building, Food Safety andInspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.(See also ``Comments'' under Supplementary Information.)

This proposed rule would not result in anannual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; a major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State,or local government agencies or geographical regions; or have significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. Current regulations preventthe distribution into human food channels of those meat or poultry productsoffered for importation into the United States from foreign countries andsubsequently refused entry. The regulations further prohibit the reimportationof such product into the United States. Although the regulations currentlydo not so state, FSIS has authority under the FMIA and the PPIA to takethe necessary steps to preclude the distribution in the United States ofany refused entry product that has been returned to the United States.This proposal would not adopt new policy, but would merely specify actionscurrently authorized under the Acts which provide for the administrativedetention and the judicial seizure and condemnation of product, in commerce,which is adulterated or misbranded or otherwise in violation of the FMIAor PPIA. As such, no new requirements would be placed on foreign or domesticmarkets.    <ITAG tagnum="84">Effect on Small Entities   </ITAG>The Administrator has determined that this proposed rule would not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). This proposedrule merely clarifies the regulations to reflect authority establishedunder the Acts with respect to the administrative detention and judicialseizure and condemnation of meat or poultry products that are adulteratedor misbranded or otherwise in violation of the FMIA or PPIA.    <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments    </ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning thisproposal. Written comments should be sent to the Policy Office specifyingthe docket number which appears in the heading of this document. Any persondesiring opportunity for oral presentation of views as provided under thePPIA must make such request to Patrick J. Clerkin so that arrangementsmay be made for such views to be presented. A transcript will be made ofall views orally presented. All comments submitted pursuant to this actionwill be made available for public inspection in the Policy Office between9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.    <ITAG tagnum="84">Background    </ITAG>Section 20(a) of the FMIA (21 U.S.C. 620) provides that ``No carcasses,parts of carcasses, meat or meat food products * * * which are capableof use as human food, shall be imported into the United States if sucharticles are adulterated or misbranded and unless they comply with all* * * other provisions of the Act and regulations issued thereunder * **.'' Section 20(b) of the FMIA further provides that ``The Secretary mayprescribe the terms and conditions for the destruction of all such articleswhich are imported contrary to this section unless (1) they are exportedby the owner or consignee within the time fixed therefor by the Secretary,or (2) in the case of articles which are not in compliance with the Actsolely because of misbranding, such articles are brought into compliancewith the Act under supervision of authorized representatives of the Secretary.''Section 17 (a) and (b) of the PPIA (21 U.S.C. 466) contains similar languagefor poultry and poultry products, except that no provision is made forpoultry products that do not comply because of misbranding to be broughtinto compliance.  Section 402 of the FMIA (21 U.S.C. 672) provides that ``Whenever any carcass,part of a carcass, meat or meat food product of cattle, sheep, swine, goats,horses, mules, or other equines, or any product exempted from the definitionof a meat food product, or any dead, dying, disabled, or diseased cattle,sheep, swine, goat, or equine is found by any authorized representativeof the Secretary upon any premises where it is held for purposes of, orduring or after distribution in, commerce or otherwise subject to titleI or II of this Act, and there is reason to believe that any such articleis adulterated or misbranded and is capable of use as human food, or thatit has not been inspected, in violation of the provisions of title I ofthis Act or of any other Federal law or the laws of any State or Territory,or the District of Columbia, or that such article or animal has been oris intended to be, distributed in violation of any such provisions, itmay be detained by such representative for a period not to exceed twentydays, pending action under section 403 of this Act or notification of anyFederal, State, or other governmental authorities having jurisdiction oversuch article or animal, and shall not be moved by any person, firm, orcorporation from the place at which it is located when so detained, untilreleased by such representative.''Section 403(a) of the FMIA (21 U.S.C. 673) provides that ``Any carcass,part of a carcass, meat or meat food product of cattle, sheep, swine, goats,horses, mules or other equines, or any dead, dying, disabled, or diseasedcattle, sheep, swine, goat, or equine, that is being transported in commerceor otherwise subject to title I or II of this Act, or is held for salein the United States after such transportation, and that (1) is or hasbeen prepared, sold, transported, or otherwise distributed or offered orreceived for distribution in violation of this Act, or (2) is capable ofuse as human food and is adulterated or misbranded, or (3) in any otherway is in violation of this Act, shall be liable to be proceeded againstand seized and condemned, at any time, on a libel of information in anyUnited States district court or other proper court as provided in section404 of this Act within the jurisdiction of which the article or animalis found.'' Sections 19 and 20(a) of the PPIA (21 U.S.C. 467b) containsimilar provisions for poultry and poultry products.Part 327 of the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR Part 327) andSubpart T of the poultry products inspection regulations (9 CFR Part 381,Subpart T) prescribe the requirements for meat and poultry products offeredfor importation into the United States as authorized by the FMIA and PPIA.Such products offered for importation from any foreign country are inspectedby departmental inspectors before they are entered into the United States.The inspectors report their findings to the Director of Customs at theport of entry where such products were offered for admission into the UnitedStates.If any such products are identified as ``U.S. Refused Entry'', the inspectorrequests the Director of Customs to refuse admission of the product andto direct the owner or consignee of the refused entry product to exportsuch product within 45 days. The owner or consignee may opt not to reexportthe product, but rather may, within the 45-day period, either destroy theproduct under departmental supervision or convert the product into animalfood. As previously discussed, the FMIA contains an exception to this rulethat provides that any meat food product which has been refused entry solelybecause of misbranding may be brought into compliance with the Act underdepartmental supervision. This exemption is also provided in andSection;327.13(a)(4) of the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 327.13(a)(4)).If the owner or consignee does not take appropriate action within the specifiedtime period, the Acts and regulations authorize the Secretary to destroythe product for human food purposes (9 CFR 327.13(a)(6) and 381.202(a)(5)).This is necessary to prevent adulterated or misbranded product from enteringinto U.S. commerce.Section 327.13(a)(7) of the Federal meat inspection regulations and andSection;381.202(a)(6) of the poultry products inspection regulations prohibit thereturn to the United States of product which had been refused entry andexported to another country (9 CFR 327.13(a)(7) and 381.202(a)(6)). Ifsuch product is returned to the United States, FSIS is authorized underthe FMIA and PPIA to administratively detain the product pursuant to section402 of the FMIA or section 19 of the PPIA, to preclude its distributionin commerce and seek judicial seizure and condemnation of such productin accordance with section 403 of the FMIA or section 20 of the PPIA. Thecurrent regulations, however, do not specify that such refused entry productis subject to detention and judicial seizure and condemnation under thelaw. To clarify the regulations in this regard, FSIS is proposing to amendandSection;andSection; 327.13 and 381.202 of the Federal meat and poultry productsinspection regulations, specifically to provide that such returned, refusedentry product shall be subject to administrative detention and judicialseizure and condemnation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rule</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>9 CFR Part 327Meat inspection, Imported products.9 CFR Part 381Poultry products inspection, Imported products.For the reasons set out in the preamble, Title 9, Parts 327 and 381 ofthe Code of Federal Regulations are proposed to be amended as set forthbelow.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 327_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
