Many privately insured credit unions claim they're betteroff without federal insurance. They fear regulators inWashington eventually will siphon off federal credit unioninsurance funds to help prop up ailing thrifts and banks,exposing credit unions to greater risk in the event offailure. Also, some credit unions assert that stateregulations are stricter than federal rules.</LP><TEXT>   Federal officials disagree, however. They contend thatwhile most privately insured credit unions are sound, somestates allow credit unions to make riskier loans than federalregulations permit. Also, these officials say, privateinsurers of credit unions operate with little oversight.About 10% of the nation's credit unions, representing $20.8billion in assets, are privately insured.   Credit unions expressed some concern about the RhodeIsland crisis, in which healthy as well as ailing creditunions had to be shut down because their insurer came underpressure. Paul Fertig, a marketing manager at NationalDeposit Insurance Corp., a Dublin, Ohio, insurer of creditunions, said he was busy reassuring members that it hasn'tany connection with the insurer of the Rhode Island creditunions. &quot;The fax machine has burned up twice,&quot; Mr. Fertigjoked.   John Rickmeier, of IDC Financial Publishing Inc., afinancial analysis firm based in Hartland, Wis., says heagrees, for the most part, with the optimistic picturepainted by many credit unions. &quot;The credit-union industry ishealthy -- there's no question about it,&quot; he says. &quot;What wehave is just a couple of states with potential problems, andRhode Island is the most obvious.&quot;   He cites other New England states, as well as Idaho andKansas, as potential trouble spots, primarily because ofseveral institutions with high loan-deliquency rates comparedwith equity capital. But most other states -- California,Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Iowa and Missouri --are in &quot;pretty good shape,&quot; he says.   In Boise, Idaho, Larry Chandler, a credit union examinerwith the state's finance department, said the credit unionindustry there isn't in trouble. He said that federally andprivately insured credit unions have roughly equal loandelinquency rates.   Federal regulators are particularly concerned that thereis little oversight of even the healthiest credit unions'private insurers. An FDIC official said that the agencystopped collecting data on private insurers in 1982 becauseof difficulty in getting the insurers to submit informationon their practices and solvency levels.   &quot;There's nothing to obligate them to send us information,&quot;the official said. &quot;Though sometimes state regulators may befamiliar with a private insurer, they operate largely asprivate businesses. We certainly have no say over them.They're basically on their own.&quot;   But some credit unions are leery of federal insurance-andnot because it tends to be more expensive and burdensome froma regulatory standpoint. Credit Union One in Rantoul, Ill.,for example, said it dropped its federal insurance in 1988for fear that the credit union fund would be merged somehow,thus weakening what it has available to back credit unions.Credit Union One, with assets of $160 million, is one of thestate's largest privately insured credit unions.   The largest privately insured credit union in the nationis the United Air Lines Employees' Credit Union in suburbanChicago. It has assets of $1.7 billion and capital of $80million.   Gene Artemenko, United Air credit union president, saidits members were unfazed by the Rhode Island debacle, andadded that he doesn't see a need for it to adopt federalinsurance. Mr. Artemenko claims that the credit union'sinsurance carrier is tougher than the federal agency. He sayshis credit union is required to file monthly financialstatements and investment reports with its member-ownedinsurance carrier, National Deposit Insurance. With federalinsurance, he says, the credit union would be required tofile a financial statement only every six months.   Mr. Artemenko says he worries that federal regulators willuse the Rhode Island debacle as ammunition to push federalinsurance on credit unions. &quot;But the feds have shown thatthey don't regulate any better,&quot; he said.   Regardless of how they are insured, many credit unions areacting to cut their potential risks. Billy H. Thomas,assistant commissioner of the credit union section of theTennessee Department of Financial Institutions, says bothprivately and federally insured credit unions in the stateare tightening their real estate lending policies and somehave stopped making real estate loans.   Privately insured Old Hickory Credit Union in suburbanNashville, Tenn., on June 30 had assets of $127 million andcapital of $12.1 million. In 1990, Old Hickory began to makeonly real estate loans that it can sell on the secondarymarket.   Washington state's privately insured credit unions asserttheir safeguards are sufficient to prevent a RhodeIsland-type experience. For example, credit unions areprohibited from holding more than 30% of their total assetsin first-mortgage loans.   &quot;There has never been a loss that our membership couldn'thandle,&quot; says Frank V. Mathews, chief executive officer ofthe City Credit Union, Seattle, and a director of the privateinsurance fund, Washington Share Guarantee Association.   In Florida and Georgia, the largest privately insuredcredit unions are also among the most conservative. They tendto maintain higher capital levels as a percentage of assetsthan required under either state or federal regulations.   Space Coast Credit Union in Melbourne, Fla., for example,with assets of $219 million, maintains 6.47% capital as apercentage of assets. To qualify for federal insurance, thelevel must be 4.5%. It does no commercial lending.   Donald F. Wills, president of Broward Schools Credit Unionin Fort Lauderdale, Fla., says he fears Rhode Island'stroubles will inspire other state legislatures to rejectprivate insurance pools for credit unions. He says,&quot;Everybody's running scared and there's just no telling whatCongress and the state legislatures are going to do.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
