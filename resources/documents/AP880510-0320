Burnley said the Soviet Union is launching 10 times as manyspaceloads as the United States annually but the U.S. governmentwants to bridge the gap, which widened after America's commercialprogram came to a halt following the 1986 explosion of theChallenger space shuttle.   ``The Soviets are taking clever advantage of our space-launchhiatus, luring firms with their government-financed launchings,''Burnley said at the 50th Aviation-Space Writers Associationconference.   ``I am opposed to allowing any U.S. firm to use a Sovietlauncher, regardless of whether the threat of technology transferis posed,'' he said.   The Soviets, who sent the first satellite into orbit in 1957,have launched the most satellites into space of any country. TheSoviets' powerful booster rockets also can put into orbit heavierpayloads than their Western competitors.   In March, the Soviet Union said it launched its first payloadfor a paying customer, India. A month earlier, a Massachusettsfirm, Payload Systems Inc., became the first U.S. company toreceive authorization to send an experiment aboard a Sovietspacecraft.   The U.S. Commerce and State Departments approved a two-yearagreement starting in 1989 to have Soviet cosmonauts aboard the MIRspace station perform protein crystallization experiments forPayload Systems' clients.   Under the 1984 Commercial Space Launch Act, the U.S.Transporation Department defines and regulates commercial spaceefforts. In 1986, the Reagan administration announced that thespace shuttle would no longer carry commercial or foreignsatellites, except for defense-related missions.   The directive was designed to foster competition among privatelaunchers, and Burnley said American companies have contracted tolaunch 14 satellites, with reservations for 17 more. Eleven of thecontracts are from foreign governments or internationalorganizations.   Meantime, though, the Soviet Union is seeking more U.S.payloads, Burnley said.   ``I perceive a danger to our national security in the Sovietenticement of launch contracts with their artificially lowprices,'' he said. ``American companies are looking for inexpensiverides for their payloads.   ``If we ever allowed the American use of Soviet launchers tobecome a pattern, the Soviets' already mature launch capabilitywould be further strengthened while our launch facilities could lierotting on the ground.''   Burnley said he opposed the government's approval of PayloadSystems' Soviet contract because ``paying the Soviet Union withU.S. hard currency to help them build a launch capacity that couldbe used against us our allies in wartime is unwise.''</TEXT></DOC>
