Meanwhile, Rep. John LaFalce (D., N.Y.) said he would attempt to move legislation this week to give the regulators authority to raise an additional $5 billion on debt markets to continue merging and closing troubled thrifts.    And Congress is expected to clear legislation this week setting up a bipartisan commission to recommend solutions to the savings-and-loan problem early next year. The House Banking Committee, following the Senate's lead, approved such a commission Friday. The bill is fueled by a growing belief that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board lacks the resources to deal with all insolvent thrifts without help from the Treasury.    The figure for the Bank Board's spending in the year that ended Friday dwarfs the $8 billion in promissory notes that the board had forecast it would owe at fiscal year end. In fact, the board said it now owes a total of $12.8 billion in notes and an estimated $7.6 billion in guarantees.    The board has used these IOUs to compensate acquirers of insolvent thrifts for their negative net worth -- assets minus liabilities. It can't use much cash, because its thrift-insurance arm, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., is insolvent.    In the latest transactions, announced Friday, the Bank Board about doubled the amount of outside capital that it has been able to attract to Texas thrift mergers.    The board said Club Corp. International of Dallas would acquire three thrifts: CreditBanc Savings Association, Franklin Savings Association and Great West Savings Bank, all of Austin.    Club Corp., the largest U.S. owner and operator of private dining and country clubs, will put up $25 million to $30 million in capital to take over thrifts with $1.2 billion in assets, the Bank Board said. It will get $1 billion in assistance, including a $264 million note and commitments guaranteeing it income and reimbursement for capital losses on certain assets.    As expected, three other thrifts went to a joint venture led by Temple-Inland Inc., Diboll, Texas, an industrial and financial firm, with 10% of the shares of the venture going to Trammell Crow Co. and Mason Best Co., both of Dallas. The group obtained Guaranty Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Dallas; First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Austin; and Delta Savings of Texas, Alvin.    The partners agreed to invest $75 million now and to raise their investment to $128 million by Jan. 1, 1991. The FSLIC will contribute $1.5 billion in assistance, including a $710 million note, and capital and income guarantees on certain assets.    The FSLIC will retain warrants for 20% of both acquirers' common stock, and will be able to reduce its assistance with a share of their tax benefits.    The deals raised to 124 the number of insolvent thrifts merged or closed this year with Bank Board assistance.    Both Temple-Inland and Trammell Crow said they hadn't any plans to use their newly acquired thrift to finance their own ventures. Temple-Inland, largely a building and paper-products concern, has a large financial services unit, including a small east Texas thrift, that finances residential and commercial developments. &quot;This type of financing would not do for a public company,&quot; said Clifford J. Grum, president and chief executive officer.    Club Corp., a closely held development and resort concern, didn't rule out lending to some of its residential real estate developments. But such lending will be under tighter restrictions than usual, said Thomas Lykos, a deputy director of the FSLIC.    Meanwhile, Bank Board sources confirmed that Olney Savings Association, Olney, Texas, might be acquired soon, along with as many as nine other thrifts, mainly in west Texas. Don Adams, a businessman in Bryan and College Station, Texas, with cable television and real estate investments, &quot;has been negotiating with regulators to provide financing for the Olney acquisitions and could gain control of the merged institution,&quot; according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. </TEXT></DOC>
