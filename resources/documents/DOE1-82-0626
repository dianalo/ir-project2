The results obtained by determinationof the leached radioactivity allow us to establish a classification ofthe mobility for each product and its possibility of contaminating infiltrationwater in the soil. Qualitative analysis of the leached residues confirmsthe predominant presence of deethylated atrazine.</TEXT></DOC>
