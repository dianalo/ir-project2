Hungary took a step toward opening a stock market last summer when the government drafted a bill to legalize private ownership. The legislation is expected to be presented to the Hungarian Parliament in September and is likely to take effect by Jan. 1, according to political sources in Budapest.    Analysts said Hungary's efforts to modernize its economic system got a boost this week when a reform-minded official, Karoly Grosz, was named to succeed veteran leader Janos Kadar as the nation's Communist Party chief.    The Hungarian delegation was reported to have met here with stock market traders, bankers and representatives of the Swiss stock markets association. Stock market sources said the group asked for an assessment of the feasibility and a list of basic requirements for setting up a Hungarian stock market. But, these sources said, although the visit signaled a further opening by Hungary to the West, Hungary's $18 billion of foreign debt outstanding could be an obstacle to getting the financing needed to start a stock exchange.    &quot;They've got big plans, but this was just a first visit to test the waters and see how much an exchange would cost and what form it would take,&quot; one stock market source said. </TEXT></DOC>
