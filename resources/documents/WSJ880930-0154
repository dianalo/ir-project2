The Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade group, said sales of stock, bond and income funds totaled $6.8 billion in August, down 2.8% from July's $7.0 billion. In August 1987, sales were $13.3 billion.    Redemptions in August were $8.3 billion, resulting in a net outflow of $1.6 billion. Although redemptions were higher than in July, analysts said they appear to reflect normal attrition and don't show any sudden tendency among investors to flee funds. Monthly figures don't include money market funds.    &quot;The figures show that people are doing absolutely nothing because they are uncertain about what to do,&quot;' said John Marksee, research director for the American Association of Individual Investors in Chicago. &quot;When people don't know which way to go, they sit on their hands.&quot;    Some analysts believe demand for mutual funds will remain slack throughout the year. Avi Nachmany, an analyst at Strategic Insight, a mutual fund research firm, says investors won't return to funds &quot;until after the presidential election,&quot; when some uncertainties concerning the economy are resolved. &quot;Things should improve by the first quarter of next year,&quot; he said.    The institute's figures showed that all types of funds suffered. Investors pulled a net $900 million out of stock funds in August, compared with a net outflow of $400 million in July and net inflows of $3 billion in August 1987.    Bond and income funds registered net withdrawals of $600 million in August compared with withdrawals of $500 million in July and net sales of $1.1 billion in August a year ago.    August was the sixth month this year in which there were net outflows in stock funds and the second month since the stock market crash last October that investors have pulled more money out of both stock and bond funds than they put in.    Assets of all mutual funds, including money market and short-term municipal funds, decreased in August to $796.2 billion from a revised $805.5 billion at the end of July. The institute attributed the weakness to declining stock and bond prices in August. Total assets stood at $848.3 billion in August 1987.    Meanwhile, managers of stock, bond and income funds had cash reserves of 10.6% in August, the same as in July but much higher than the 8.8% on hand in August 1987. High cash reserves, an indication that managers are taking a more cautious approach, cushion mutual funds against market drops but can be a drag on performance in a rising market.    Kurt Brouwer, a San Francisco investment adviser, says the latest mutual funds sales report suggests that investors might be overreacting to the stock market sluggishness.    &quot;They are still mourning the crash,&quot; he said. &quot;First they expressed shock, then anger and depression. Now they're apathetic.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
