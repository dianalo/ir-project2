The settlement stems from Labor Department citations issued last November against the car maker for alleged record-keeping violations at its Belvidere, Ill., assembly plant. The department had proposed Chrysler pay $910,000 in penalties.    Under the settlement announced Friday by the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Chrysler didn't admit having committed any violations. But the company agreed to make sure its record-keeping procedures comply with job-safety regulations, and to review its injury and illness records dating back to January 1985.    The agreement covers alleged violations at Chrysler plants in Belvidere, Newark, Del., and Twinsburg, Ohio. Of the penalty, $285,000 stemmed from alleged violations at the Belvidere plant.    The original citations resulted from a review of the Belvidere plant's injury records from January 1985 through April 1986. Department inspectors found 182 instances of work-related injuries that hadn't been recorded as required by federal rules. OSHA officials said they discovered the problem during the investigation of a death at the plant last April.    In Highland Park, Mich., Chrysler said, &quot;The dispute between Chrysler and OSHA centered on the interpretation of federal record-keeping guidelines. Record-keeping violations were identified and we worked with OSHA to resolve our differences of interpretation and correct any deficiencies that were found.    &quot;OSHA's allegations relate to Chrylser's record-keeping practices, rather than the actual health or safety of Chrysler workers or Chrysler facilities. It is important to recognize that fact.&quot;    The biggest fine ever proposed in a jobsafety case is the $1.4 million that OSHA recommended last year against Union Carbide Corp. for alleged health and safety violations at its Institute, W.Va., plant. That case is still pending. </TEXT></DOC>
