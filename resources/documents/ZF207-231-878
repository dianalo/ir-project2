Dale MabryHighway, Tampa, FL 33618; (800) 523-8973, (813) 962-7800.andP;  Version: 1.04Requires: Mac 512KE or later.andP;  Compatibility: Mac II friendly; problems withMultiFinder.andP;  Application Size: 21K Copy Protection: NoneandM;One hallmark of high-quality commercial typesetting is kerning, a techniquefor adjusting letterspacing to improve the appearance and readability oftext.andP;  For instance, the letters To look and read better if the o is tuckedunder the T.andP;  Most Macintosh fonts come with some predefined kerned pairs,which are stored in a special table in the FOND resource and automaticallyapplied whenever the font is used.andP;  Some programs let you adjustletter-spacing manually, which can be useful in touching up a headline, forexample.andP;  If you don't like a font's kerned pairs, however, and you want toadd or modify kerned pairs globally, you're out of luck.andM;Enter LetrTuck, a nifty little program from EDCO Services that lets youdirectly alter the kerned-pair information in a font's FOND resource.andP;  Youcan add, delete, or modify up to 2,000 kerned pairs per font.andP;  The changesare permanent and will be used automatically for both screen and printerversions of the font.andM;You can customize any font that is installed in your System or is availablethrough a program like Suitcase.andP;  Be sure to back up your System before youbegin because the program alters the System file.andP;  The process is simple:Select the font and style--each style (bold, italic, and so on) has aseparate kerned-pair table -- and LetrTuck will show the kerned pairs thatalready exist.andP;  When you select a pair, a dialog box displays the letters in12 and 72 points along with their current kerning value.andP;  You change thekerning value either by sliding a scroll bar to the left (tighter) or right(looser) or by typing in the value directly.andP;  Changes are reflected instantlyin the two-letter samples.andP;  Adding a new kerned pair is as simple asspecifying the letters and adjusting their spacing.andP;  To delete a pair, selectit and use the Delete command.andM;When you kern a letter pair, you're actually changing the system of unitsused to measure the spacing between characters.andP;  LetrTuck's default is 72units to the em, but you can choose increments ranging from 10 to 2,000 unitsper em.andP;  (An em space is as many points wide as the font is high.)andP;  Wheninstalling the new kerning values in the FOND resource, LetrTuck translatesthem into the 1,000-unit system used by PostScript.andM;Kerning values may be difficult to understand at first, and the manual --despite good intentions -- is of little help.andP;  Don't worry about calculatinghow much actual space needs to be closed up between a pair.andP;  Just keep inmind that kerning values are proportional to point size; judge your kerningefforts visually using the 12- and 72-point samples.andM;It's a good idea to print a sample of any pairs you've added or modified tosee how they look on paper.andP;  LetrTuck will print five sizes of the selectedpair and all other pairs that begin with the same character.andP;  Once you'resatisfied, you can save the kerning table back to the original font or applyit to another font or style.andP;  This could be useful if your fonts are similarenough, but generally you'll want to have different tables for each font.andO;LetrTuck also lets you save the kerning table as a text file.andM;LetrTuck does provide a wuick and easy way of adjusting kerned-pair tableS,but some of its features are inelegant, confusing, and even a little buggy.andO;For instance, the program won't store kerning values entered from thekeyboard.andP;  It also stubbornly refuses to print samples of any pair beginningwith an apostrophe.andP;  More importantly, LetrTuck does not work withMultiFinder.andP;  The program crashed when we tried to save the kerning table,and the font we altered was subsequently inaccessible from LetrTuck or anyother program and had to be reinstalled.andM;LetrTuck calls its font menu a Family menu, but if you install astyle-specific screen fotn like B Palatino Bold, it will be listed separatelyfrom the rest of the Palatino Family.andP;  What's more, the Family menu isn'tsorted alphabetically, so if you have a lot of fonts, be prepared to spendtime searching for the one you want.andM;There's no way to see all the kerning values for a table at once, so youcan't easily compare values.andP;  This is too bad, because many predefined pairshave a value of zero (no kerning) and could easily be deleted to save spacein a crowded system.andP;  If you add a kerned pair and then change your mind,clicking Cancel should do the trick.andP;  But instead, the program adds the pairwith a kerning value of zero, unneccessarily cluttering the kerning table.andM;Finally, the manual is generally clear and well presented, but it serves thedual purpose of documenting both the Macintosh and PC versions of LetrTuck.andO;In some sections -- most notably the discussion of the unitsystem--information on both versions is presented jointly, making itdifficult to decipher which information is relevant to the Macintosh.andP;  Inshort, LetrTuck is a useful utility for the serious desktop publisher, butthe program itself could stand a little more tightening.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
