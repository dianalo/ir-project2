The announcement referred to a U.S. plan to have East and WestGermany work out legal, political and economic procedures for amerger immediately after East Germany holds national elections inmid-March.   The ``Big Four'' allies of World War II _ the United States,Britain, France and the Soviet Union _ then will discuss securityquestions, including whether a reunified Germany would be a memberof the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.   The plan, known as ``2-plus-4,'' as the subject of a feverish anoff-the-floor discussion today while NATO and Warsaw Pact foreignministers held a closed session on a U.S. proposal for unarmedaerial surveillance to ally suspicions of surprise attacks.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Shevardnadze then met with WestGerman Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.   Hurd said, meanwhile, he had been holding continuous discussionwith Baker, Genscher and French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas.   ``We are quite close to an agreement on a proposal for a meetingfor the four powers,'' Hurd said.   By the time the plan surfaced here Monday, State Departmentofficials were privately describing Moscow as ``quite interested''in the scheme.   Baker held an unannounced meeting with Shevardnadze on Monday,their second of the day, and the two spoke for about 10 minutestoday. Baker was returning to Washington later from a nine-day tripthat also took him to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Bulgariaand Romania.   Three forces are at work in the no-longer-secret operation:   _A conviction Moscow is beginning to share with Washington thatunification is inevitable.   _A Western desire to keep Germany in NATO.   _Anxiety within the countries among people who suffered atGermany's hands in World War II.   Bush administration policymakers are operating on an assumptionthose concerns can be allayed _ and any aggressive Germantendencies diverted _ by keeping Germany within the 16-member NATO.   The plan is called ``2-plus-4'' because East Germany and WestGermany, joined by the Big Four allied powers, would work out theformula for the new and stronger state.   As State Department officials outlined the strategy to reportershere, East Germany would become a sovereign power after nationalelections are held in mid-March.   Almost immediately, the Warsaw Pact ally of the Soviet Unionwould begin working with West Germany to plan the legal, economicand political foundation of a merged country.   Among the decisions that would be theirs to make would be thesize of the Germany army.   In a second stage, the Big Four would delve into security issues.   The most important among them: a German role in NATO.   But the State Department officials, speaking on condition theirnames not be used, stressed that no outside power would have theright to interfere in the Germans' sovereign decisions.   Preparations for the evolving German reunification scenario havebeen under way quietly for several weeks even though the subjectwas not the stated reason for a number of meetings Baker has hadwith world leaders in and out of Washington.   Baker talked about the matter separately with Hurd and Genscherseparately in Washington; with Dumas during a refueling stop enroute to Czechoslovakia, and finally, with Soviet leaders when hereached Moscow.   Genscher outlined his vision for a new Germany in a speech tothe ``Open Skies'' conference here today. There was no reference toNATO or Germany's association with the alliance in the future.   ``We tell all our neighbors what we want to unite: the FederalRepublic of Germany (West Germany), the German Democratic Republic(East Germany) and the whole of Berlin _ no less, and no more. Wedo not have territorial claims against any of our neighbors,''Genscher said.   He said the Germans seek unification ``out of responsibility forEuropean peace, and we seek it as a contribution to stability inEurope.''   Referring obliquely to World War II, the foreign minister said,``We Germans now follow the path of unity for which we waited fordecades; we are aware of the historical dimension of this process.''   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Genscher flew to Moscowlast Saturday to lobby for unification with East Germany.   ``The Soviets are quite interested in this,'' said a U.S.official who is a principal architect of the closely guarded U.S.policy. ``They have not adopted a dogmatic position.''   And yet, the official acknowledged, the Soviets also have notapproved ``any mechanism'' for unification, including the U.S.formula.   Britain and France have signed on, however, and the campaign ispicking up steam.   Gorbachev was quoted Monday by ADN, the East German news agency,as having told Kohl that it was unacceptable for Germany to stay inNATO.   But Brent Scowcroft, the national security assistant toPresident Bush, said Monday in Washington that the Soviets had toldBaker ``it was not really as positive as that.''   And Shevardnadze told a group of British reporters here thatwhile neutrality ``is the best way'' for a reunited Germany, ``I amnot saying neutrality is the only way.''</TEXT></DOC>
