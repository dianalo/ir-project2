Korea's labor movement was born last summer in a spasm of anger and violence. Workers went on more than 3,600 wildcat strikes, sometimes clashing with police as they demanded -- and won -- double-digit wage increases and the right to unionize.    There has been less than one-tenth the number of strikes this season, the government says. They aren't any easier to settle, though, because the unions are demanding wage increases of between 20% and 60% on top of last year's average 13.5% settlement. But none has been violent; almost all the strikes have been legal in the government's eyes, so the police stay away.    Most companies, still playing hardball with the unions, now realize they must negotiate. So the unions' struggle is no longer for recognition but for better wages and working conditions.    Unions are wiser, too. Leaders spent the winter in training sessions sponsored by universities, the U.S. AFL-CIO and international labor groups. The result is better-organized and more-disciplined unions.    &quot;We aren't as radical as we were before,&quot; says 27-year-old Ho Nam Chol, a striking wire-harness installer at Daewoo Motor Co., which is owned equally by Korea's Daewoo group and General Motors Corp. of the U.S. &quot;We didn't get what we wanted that way. Now we are better organized.&quot;    Despite the absence of headline-grabbing violence, and the ability of the Korean economy to absorb large wage boosts, the strikes this spring nevertheless raise concern, as they will establish the practices and procedures for the future of Korean labor-management relations. &quot;This is the first setting of a ritual,&quot; says Park Fun Koo, an economist with the Korea Development Institute, a think tank.    The Korean labor movement is nowhere near Japan's strike-free spring labor ritual, where some unions politely protest during lunch hour so as not to disrupt production. The labor-management relationship here still more closely resembles the distrustful one found in the U.S. Union-busting is rife, particulary among the Samsung and Hyundai groups. Violence is just under the surface.    Worker resentment at the big companies shows in the large wage demands. Even pro-union economists worry that the unions will come to expect large annual wage increases that would stifle economic growth. Yet similar worries expressed last summer, that the strikes would disrupt exports, didn't come to pass. Last year's exports grew 36.2%, the biggest one-year gain since 1976.    Wage boosts of 30% over two years sound deadly to Westerners. But Korea's booming economy can absorb them, economists say. And the expected 10% appreciation of the won against the U.S. dollar this year should erase much of the inflationary effect of higher wages. &quot;Pushing labor as a scapegoat for inflation is very stupid economics,&quot; says Mr. Park of KDI. Indeed, a bigger worry is the forecast of 18% growth in the money supply this year.    Rising labor costs will hurt weaker companies, but with average corporate profits expected to rise as much as 30% in 1988, most will be able to handle it. Labor accounts for only about 10% of total costs, and Korean companies routinely achieve double-digit productivity gains.    The real worries about this season's strikes are the precedents they set. Unions want to establish the rule that a strike settlement include wages for the strike period. Companies say, &quot;No work, no pay,&quot; but they may be losing. Daewoo Shipbuilding andamp; Heavy Machinery Co., the bellwether of labor relations in Korea, settled its strike with a 19.1% wage increase and a one-time bonus of half a month's pay. But the company insists the bonus doesn't represent wages lost during the strike, which lasted half a month.    On Saturday, the union leadership at Daewoo Motor tentatively agreed to a new contract that includes a half-month's pay bonus, which the company calls a &quot;production promotion allowance.&quot; The strike entered its 15th day yesterday.    &quot;No work, no pay&quot; is accepted in the West as a management-bargaining tool. But here, say some of the country's union theoreticians, unions need the advantage because the power balance is still tipped in favor of companies. Radicals are still being arrested. The government can still refuse to recognize certain unions. All a company has to do is get a few workers to form a union at the same time as a legitimate union and both unions are disqualified. Regional or industrywide unions are forbidden.    &quot;It's divide and conquer,&quot; says Prof. Park Young Ki, director of Sogang University's Institute for Labor and Management.    But the unions are developing more weapons in what is becoming a ritual of spring labor strikes. &quot;They have good self-control,&quot; says a spokesman for Daewoo Motor. &quot;It's a much stronger union than last year.&quot;    Daewoo should know. To demonstrate solidarity and irritate Daewoo Motor, the union there got all workers to use only one of the plant's 15 cafeterias, creating long lines and stopping work. &quot;They paralyzed our operations,&quot; says the spokesman.    At other companies, unions had workers take days off at the same time to shut a plant down, or go to the factory bank at the same time. And during strikes, union discipline prevents workers from damaging equipment, marching off the site or otherwise provoking authorities. They also keep out campus radicals or company provocateurs. </TEXT></DOC>
