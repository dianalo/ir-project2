In Moldavia, activists said police beat protesters who forcedcancellation of the military part of the republic's parade.Striking miners in the Soviet Arctic joined a celebration withslogans urging the government to allow greater independence andimprove living and working conditions.   The unprecedented alternative march wound through the capital asPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Soviet leadership stood atopthe Lenin Mausoleum and reviewed the traditional display ofmilitary hardware.   The official tolerance of a counter-demonstration on thehallowed national holiday showed how far the Soviet Union has comefrom the authoritarian rule of Gorbachev's predecessors.   So did the toned-down nature of the Red Square celebrationsmarking the 72nd anniversary of the revolution that brought theCommunists to power in Russia. Not as much emphasis was placed onmilitary might as in previous years.   ``We're tired of 70 years of Communist power with nothing havingchanged for the better, and this is our protest,'' said marcherTaisya Shlyonova, a pensioner. The demonstrators represented abroad spectrum of unofficial groups.   ``We don't want the people to be sheep that can be led as theyhave been led for 72 years,'' popular prosecutor Telman Gdlyansaid. ``Power must be taken away from the apparatus and given tothe people.''   Leaders of the independent event steered their marchers awayfrom Red Square and a possible confrontation with authorities orwith the thousands of marchers at the official ceremonies.   Responding to posters plastered around the city on the eve ofRevolution Day, activists assembled near the Dynamo Metro stationtwo hours before the start of official ceremonies.   Their route took them to a fork with one street leading towardRed Square, and some demonstrators initially headed that way.However, leaders made appeals from a sound truck and steered theminstead to a route sanctioned by city officials.   Organizers said they had been told by authorities they would notbe permitted to march through the square because they could notguarantee the march would remain orderly.   The marchers, many walking arm in arm, chanted slogans insupport of maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin and other reformistmembers of the Congress of People's Deputies and shouted ``Downwith the KGB'' secret police.   Some brandished posters scorning the 1917 Communist revolutionglorified at the official ceremonies.   ``Seventy-two years on the road to nowhere,'' said one poster.Others proclaimed, ``Down With Ligachev,'' a reference to YegorLigachev, the hard-line Communist on the ruling Politburo who hascome to symbolize resistance to economic and social reform.   The marchers represented a wide spectrum of interests, fromenvironmental groups protesting construction of a nuclear powerstation to church groups demanding freedom of worship in theofficially atheist Communist state.   Last year, such unofficial groups marched in some Soviet citieson Revolution Day, but this was the first time they took to thestreets of Moscow on the holiday.   In the southern republic of Moldavia, police beat people in acrowd of thousands that gathered near a monument to national heroKing Stephen the Great, Yuri Rozhgo, a spokesman for the MoldavianPeople's Front organization said in a telephone call from Kishinev,the republic's capital.   More were beaten when police dispersed a crowd of a couplehundred People's Front supporters on Lenin Prospekt a couple ofhours later, he said.   Officials canceled the military part of the parade. Thousands ofPeople's Front supporters marched the parade route with sloganscondemning the police and the republic's leadership, Rozhgo said.   In Red Square, the traditional parade of tanks, troops, andbanner-waving marchers selected by their workplaces passed throughon schedule.   It was broadcast on state-run television, which made noreference to the unofficial march.   Gorbachev, acknowledging the country's troubles in an informaltelevision interview during the ceremonies, said abandonment of theold system of central control without installing a new system hasresulted in ``a loss or weakening of control.''   But to go back would be ``the greatest mistake,'' he said,calling instead for faster movement toward a new economic order. Hegave few details, but progressives have recently criticized theregime for half-measures that they say only make matters worse.   Longtime observers said the official ceremonies this year wereconsiderably toned down from previous years, when the Kremlinleadership used the parade to show off the Soviets' military might.   Few missiles were in evidence today. Anti-tank guided missilesystems and surface-to-air missile resupply vehicles were droppedthis year, diplomats said. They had said they expected just one newweapon, an updated version of the T-72 tank, to join the parade.   In addition, party slogans were far less militant than just afew years ago.   In another expression of discontent, a local chapter of thenationalist People's Front movement in Riga, capital of the Balticrepublic of Latvia, declared the Bolsheviks' seizure of power wasnot a revolution but ``a government coup.''   The group said the takeover ``cut short the process ofdemocratization that started after the February 1917 revolution(that overthrew the czar).''   Czar Nicholas II abdicated to a provisional government that wasoverthrown eight months later by the Bolsheviks.</TEXT></DOC>
