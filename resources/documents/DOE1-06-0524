This retrofitted systemis one of eight of the systems in the SFBP selected for quality monitoring.The purpose of this monitoring effort is to document the performanceof quality state-of-the-art solar systems in large federal building applications.The six-story HQ AAFES Building houses a cafeteria, officer's mess andclub and office space for 2400 employees. The siphon-return drainbacksystem uses 1147 ft{sup 2} of Aircraftsman flat-plate collectors to collectsolar energy which is used to preheat domestic hot water. Solar energyis stored in a 1329-gallon tank and transferred to the hot water loadthrough a heat exchanger located in the 356-gallon DHW preheat tank.Auxiliary energy is supplied by two gas fired boilers which boost thetemperature to 130{sup 0}F before it is distributed to the load. Highlightsof the performance of the HQ AAFES Building solar system during the monitoringperiod from August 1984 through May 1985 are presented in this report.</TEXT></DOC>
