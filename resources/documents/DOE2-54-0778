The results of the measurement of the power curve are described.The applied measurement and evaluation procedure was in close agreementwith the IEA recommendations for wind turbine power performance determination.From the results can be seen that the turbine starts producing electricalpower at 10 minutes averaged wind speeds of 5 m/s. For 10-minutes averagedwind speeds between 12.5 and 15.5 m/s the electrical power is about 55kW. At higher wind speeds the power curve decreases rather fast. Theenergetic efficiency of the installation is about 39% at wind speedsof 8-9 m/s. The potential annual energy production of the installationis relatively high. 4 figs., 5 refs., 1 tab., 1 app.</TEXT></DOC>
