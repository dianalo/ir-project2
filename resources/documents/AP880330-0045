Raphael Podde, 45, of Woodmere and Gabriel Reguer, 49, ofAnaheim, Calif., were arrested Tuesday at their homes and indictedfor allegedly selling or trying to sell counterfeit Haggadoth todealers, federal prosecutors said.   The Haggadah, which recounts the story of the deliverance of theancient Hebrews from slavery in Egypt, is read by Jews during thePassover holiday celebration, which begins Friday evening.   The documents were handwritten until the invention of theprinting press in the late 1400s. Scholars believe the Haggadah wasfirst printed in Guadalajara, Spain, in 1482.   The only known edition from that printing is kept at the JewishNational and University Library in Jerusalem, authorities said.   Berlin, with a business partner in Israel, bought what hethought was a previously unknown copy of the Guadalajara Haggadahfor $60,000.   In a telephone interview, Berlin said Podde offered to sell himthe rare Haggadah in the spring of 1986, saying he had inherited itfrom the estate of his father.   Berlin said he began to doubt its authenticity a few monthslater after a friend told him that he had just been offered achance to buy a supposedly genuine Guadalajara Haggadah. So, hewent to Israel to compare it with the original.   There, he discovered differences in markings between the twodocuments and he later contacted the FBI after Podde refused to buyback the phony Haggadah, Berlin said.   Prosecutors said the defendants made the phony Haggadoth byprinting photocopies of the original onto paper made in the late15th century.   ``The only way to tell it was a counterfeit was to go to Israelto compare it to the original,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney JonnyFrank.   The indictment also accuses the defendants of selling threepages of the six-leaf counterfeit document to another dealer for$12,000 and unsuccessfully trying to sell two other phony Haggadothto two dealers for $90,000 and $100,000.   Podde, an Italian citizen, was identified as an expert printerand restorer of ancient Hebrew books. He and Reguer are partners inthe Pardes Rimonim Press, a company that prints and sells limitededitions of Hebrew books.   Podde was arrested Tuesday morning at his Woodmere home, whichalso is where the printing company is located. Reguer was arrestedTuesday at his home in California.   They were each charged with one count of conspiracy to commitwire fraud and three counts of wire fraud. Each count carries amaximum sentence of five years in jail and a $250,000 fine.</TEXT></DOC>
