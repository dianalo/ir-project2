In Khan Yunis, also in the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers openedfire during a stone-throwing demonstration, wounding ninePalestinians, Arab reports said.   The wounded included two 12-year-old boys shot in the legs withplastic bullets and a 22-year-old shot twice in the stomach,hospital officials said.   An army spokesman said two soldiers also were injured when theywere hit by stones thrown by demonstrators.   In the West Bank, the military government completed the reopeningof schools, which were closed for much of the 20-month-oldPalestinian uprising, by allowing 10th and 11th grade students toreturn to class.   In Gaza City, stores and businesses were closed following thedeath Tuesday of Ismail Abu Jayyab, 27, who was the leader of aPLO-backed students group at the closed Islamic University. He hadbeen jailed four times without charges during the uprising.   Masked youths set tires ablaze and threw up makeshift roadblocksin several neighborhoods in Gaza City, which has a population ofnearly 200,000 people. The town of Deir El-Balah, where Jayyab wasfrom, also was shut by a strike.   No casualties were reported in the protest, but a 39-year-oldmunicipal worker was shot several times by unknown assailants inGaza City. He was transferred to an Israeli hospital for surgery.   After Jayyab's death Tuesday, Palestinian witnesses said he wasshot by soldiers after a firebomb was thrown at a military vehicleand during stone throwing at troops in downtown Palestine Square.The army said he was killed by army fire during a disturbance.   The English-language Jerusalem Post quoted a witness as sayingJayyab was shot in the face at close range.   Officials at Shifa hospital, where the wounded Jayyab was broughtby soldiers, said he died of a single bullet wound above the righteye.   His death brought to 544 the number of Palestinians killed bysoldiers or Israeli civilians during the uprising. At least 100other Palestinians were slain by fellow Arab as allegedcollaborators with Israel. Thirty-eight Israeli also have beenkilled.   In the occupied West Bank, the army reported no violence as about45,000 students returned to high school classes for the first timesince January.   The army closed all schools in the West Bank early in theuprising, keeping more than 300,000 students from class. Officialsmaintained the schools served as hotbeds for organizingstone-throwing protests against soldiers.   Schools were opened briefly twice, but each time they were shutagain under military order.   The latest phased re-opening, which started July 22, camefollowing complaints by the United States and human rights groupsthat closure of schools was unfairly depriving Palestinian youths ofan education.   Schools remained open in the Gaza Strip throughout the uprising,except for individual institutions shut for brief periods followingdisturbances. Since West Bank classes resumed, the army has closedseveral individual schools where protests broke out.</TEXT></DOC>
