The documents are the key to a civil forfeiture case thatthe government plans to file today, in an effort to claim the$356 million that was in the accounts when the Swissgovernment froze them at Manila's request soon after theMarcoses were toppled in February 1986.</LP><TEXT>   Solicitor-General Frank Chavez, who obtained the documentsin Switzerland in August, said he would present the evidenceto the government ombudsman, who will file the case with theSandiganbayan, an anti-corruption court. If the court findsthat the money exceeds the Marcoses' legitimate income, andSwiss courts accept the Philippine proceedings, Switzerlandwill order the banks to release the money to Manila.   &quot;We are blazing new trails here,&quot; said Mr. Chavez. &quot;Thereis no country that has retrieved stashed wealth from Swissbanks. Several have tried, but no country has gone this far.We are nearing the end.&quot;   Mr. Chavez said he had obtained thousands of bankdocuments, including powers of attorney and bank instructionssigned by the Marcoses, from Zurich District Attorney PeterCosandey. An official at Mr. Cosandey's office said hewouldn't return until next week and that nobody else couldcomment on the Marcos accounts.   A summary of the documents provided by Mr. Chavez says theMarcoses maintained at least five sets of multimillion-dollarsecret accounts, the first of which was set up in 1968, threeyears into Mr. Marcos's 21-year rule. The summary indicatedthe couple opened a total of 19 accounts with Credit Suisseunder fictitious names of individuals, corporations andfoundations. The accounts were gradually consolidated andeventually managed through a trust at Bank Hofmann. CreditSuisse is one of Switzerland's three biggest banks, and BankHofmann is an affiliate.   A spokesman at Credit Suisse in Zurich confirmed bytelephone that the bank had released documents related toMarcos accounts to the Zurich district attorney, and that theaccounts, now frozen, remained with the bank. A director atHofmann Bank declined to comment.   Under Swiss banking statutes, the Swiss government cancompel the banks to release the money to the Philippinegovernment if Mrs. Marcos is convicted in Philippine courtsof obtaining it illegally. Mr. Chavez said he expected thePhilippine trial would take less than a year, although thepace of justice in the Philippines suggests that it mighttake much longer. Swiss officials have said that Mrs. Marcosmust be charged in connection with the accounts before yearend to maintain the freeze, but they haven't set any deadlinefor conviction.   Mrs. Marcos is being charged under a 1955 law that allowsthe government to seize any property found to be &quot;manifestlyout of proportion&quot; to the salary and other lawful income of apublic official. Mrs. Marcos held several government posts inaddition to her role as first lady.   In a guarded room at the solicitor-general's office, Mr.Chavez displayed a copy of a document signed &quot;ImeldaRomouldez Marcos&quot; opening an account under the name &quot;JaneRyan&quot; on March 21, 1968. Another document signed by Mr.Marcos opened an account in the name of &quot;William Saunders&quot;the day before, Mr. Chavez said.   The two accounts were merged into the Xandy Foundation onMarch 3, 1970, finally reconstituted as the AvertinaFoundation on May 13, 1981. In December 1989 the accountshowed a balance of $231.3 million.   The Philippine government alleges that the $356 millioncontained in the five sets of accounts was only a fraction ofthe billions of dollars that the Marcoses sent abroad duringtheir 21-year rule. &quot;It's better than nothing,&quot; Mr. Chavezsaid. If the Philippines wins control of the Swiss accounts,it would be the government's biggest piece yet of the Marcosfortune, which Manila officials estimated soon after theirdeparture at about $5 billion.   Neither Mrs. Marcos, who currently resides in the U.S.,nor her attorney in the Philippines could be reached forcomment. Manila recently lifted a ban on Mrs. Marcos'sreturn, although a ban on the return of the remains of Mr.Marcos, who died in exile in Honolulu in September 1989, isstill in effect. Mrs. Marcos said this week that she mightreturn to the Philippines this month to try to arrange forhis burial.</TEXT></DOC>
