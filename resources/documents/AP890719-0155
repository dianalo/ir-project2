The president is elected by the National Assembly, a jointmeeting of the 460-member Sejm, or parliament, and the 100-seatSenate. To be elected, a candidate must receive a majority of thevotes, with at least half the National Assembly present.   On Wednesday, communist leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski waselected to the post.   The presidency is part of the historic deal reached in Aprilbetween communist authorities and the opposition that legalized theindependent Solidarity trade union after a seven-year ban inexchange for opposition support of partially free elections.   The unstated purpose of the new office is to guarantee a periodof communist control while democratic political reforms and economicchanges are under way.   The president, the highest representative of the Polish state, iselected for a six years and can serve only one subsequent term. AnyPolish citizen who meets the requirements to be elected to the Sejmmay be a candidate for president, but he need not be a member of theparliament.   The president's duties previously were carried out by the Councilof State, which was created in 1952 and will cease to exist.   The Council of State included top members of the communistcoalition led by a chairman who was sometimes referred to aspresident of the council. However, real power rested with the rulingPolitburo led by the first secretary of the communist party.   Jaruzelski has headed the Council of State since 1985. Previouspresidents of the council included Henryk Jablonski from 1972 to1985 and Jozef Cyrankiewicz from 1970 to 1972.   The new president will be the sixth in modern Polish history,which dates from 1918 when the country regained its independence.   Although Poland had an elected president before World War II, thereal head of state during most of the interwar period was a mannever elected to the post.   Marshall Jozef Pilsudski proclaimed the Polish state at the endof World War I and secured its independence by defeating the Sovietarmy in 1920, wielding powers over defense and foreign policysimilar to that of the new presidency.   Pilsudski had the title of ``state leader'' until he retired frompublic life in 1922. He seized power again in a 1926 coup and heldit until his death in 1935. For most of that time, he held no formaltitle but was the country's acknowledged strongman.   The first president, Gabriel Narutowicz, was assassinated afteronly one week in office in 1922. There were two more presidentsuntil the start of World War II in 1939 and one president of theLondon government-in-exile during the war.   The only president after World War II was Boleslaw Bierut, thepro-Stalin communist chief. He held the office from 1947 until 1952,until the office was dropped from the constitution.   One of the president's first tasks will be to nominate a newprime minister who will then be asked to form a government. The Sejmmust approve the prime minister and his cabinet.   The president can veto legislation passed by the Sejm, but can beoverriden by a two-thirds majority of the parliament.   The president ratifies and cancels international agreements andis reponsible for defense in the Warsaw Pact nation.   He has the right to introduce martial law as required by aforeign threat to state security and he can proclaim a partial oruniversal mobilization of the armed forces for the same reason.   The president can also introduce a state of emergency as a resultof an internal security threat to the country for a period of up tothree months without consent of the National Assembly. The state ofemergency can be extended by another three months with NationalAssembly approval.   During the state of emergency, the president cannot dissolve theSejm, nor can constitutional or electoral changes be introduced.   The president does have the right to dissolve the NationalAssembly and call new elections if the legislature fails to form agovernment or pass a national budget or if legislation is passedmaking it impossible for the president to perform his constitutionalduties.   The president will sit in a large wooden chair that has beenwaiting in the balcony of the National Assembly since members of theSejm and the Senate were elected a month ago in Poland's freestvoting for four decades.</TEXT></DOC>
