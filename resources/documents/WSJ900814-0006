Mr. Corti, an agriculturalresearcher, has organized a protest against new housing forArabs and Africans in Milan.

No ThankYou]&quot;</LP><TEXT>   As the rally swells, a Senegalese street peddler namedNgor packs up his imitation Louis Vuitton handbags andhurries off. &quot;I am just doing what Italians did in America100 years ago,&quot; the 27-year-old immigrant says. &quot;Trying tomake a living.&quot;   Throughout Western Europe, societies that once sent theirhuddled masses across the Atlantic now are fending off thetired and poor from teeming Third World shores. With Europeaneconomies booming and fertility rates plummeting -- Italy'sis now the world's lowest -- the need for immigrant labor hassoared. But as Third World people pour into Europe, thediffering cultures collide. Friction could well become morefrequent and more intense if the fallout from Iraq's invasionof Kuwait creates an anti-Arab backlash. Even long before theinvasion, Europe's racial problems were getting ugly:   -- In March, masked Italians rampaged through the streetsof Florence, clubbing and knifing North Africans.   -- In April, on Hitler's birthday, neo-Nazis in Berlinassaulted African workers and clashed with Turkish streetgangs.   -- During one week in May, Swedish youths firebombedrefugee camps eight times, hospitalizing 12 immigrants.   -- In June, baton-wielding Spanish police were accused ofbeating 10 Africans camped out in Madrid's central square.   In some European countries, moreover, the nativepopulation is already declining, while that of many Africanand Arab nations is doubling every 20 to 25 years. And withEurope's internal borders set to dissolve in 1992, animmigrant arriving in Genoa or Marseilles could roam and workfreely all across the Continent.   As East/West tensions fade, &quot;immigration is the biggestproblem facing the whole European community,&quot; says RemyLeveau, a French political scientist. Adds Italiandemographer, Massimo Livi-Bacci, &quot;This isn't something likeJapanese cars that you can control with a yearly quota. Ifthe right balance isn't found, the situation could explode.&quot;                                                                                                          Germany                                                                                                          And it already has in some cities. Barricaded inside anEast Berlin garret, a young man with swastikas and stormtroopers tattooed on his arm explains the stance of a newgroup called National Alternative. &quot;If you mix races inGermany, it never works,&quot; says Heiko Baumert, flanked byother young men with shaved heads and black, steel-toedboots. &quot;We want to wake up Germans and pressure the state tokick foreigners out.&quot;   National Alternative primarily objects to 90,000immigrants in East Germany, most of whom were imported fromfellow Marxist states in Vietnam, Cuba, Mozambique andAngola. Formed in February, National Alternative set upheadquarters just a few streets from the tall, tatteredapartment blocks where most of the immigrants live. &quot;GermansDefend Yourselves]&quot; proclaims one of the group's banners. Ona Saturday night, spotlights shine from the roof, and youthspatrol the street outside, clutching baseball bats beneaththeir paramilitary jackets. To passers-by, they offerpamphlets decrying the &quot;foreign viruses in our city.&quot;   Asked if such echoes of the Third Reich are intentional,Mr. Baumert shrugs. &quot;It is demagoguery to ignore theachievements of the Nazis,&quot; he says.   The group, which receives aid and advice from neo-Nazis inWest Germany and Austria, has a hard core of only about 300members, and police recently forced them to find newheadquarters. But its doctrine has found fertile ground amongEast Germans worrying about their jobs. The men's room of anearby nightclub is scrawled with graffiti -- &quot;Sieg Heil&quot; and&quot;Foreigners Out&quot; -- and youths at the bar have used chainsand clubs to battle black Africans in an adjoining apartmentblock.   East German officials say immigrants' employment andresidency contracts -- usually running five years -- will behonored, though some employers are laying off foreigners asfree-market reforms shrink the work force. Other workersaren't waiting for pink slips. In front of a building labeled&quot;Workers Living Quarters, Bloc-A, Number 315,&quot; Vietnamese menbang together crates marked &quot;Hanoi&quot; and &quot;Haiphong&quot; and piletheir possessions inside.   &quot;I don't want to go home, but I don't want to die,either,&quot; says a 30-year-old factory worker, Phung Tien. InJune, Mr. Tien watched as skinheads stabbed and killed one ofhis friends in East Berlin's central square. Germanco-workers at the factory call him &quot;Vietsi&quot; -- an insultroughly equivalent to &quot;Jap&quot; -- and ask why he doesn't go backwhere he came from.   More than 5,000 Vietnamese in East Germany have appliedthis year for asylum in West Berlin. But tension also isrunning high on the west side of the fallen Wall, where287,000 foreign workers live. German law makes it hard for&quot;guest workers&quot; to become citizens, and many immigrants fearthat the first economic downturn will make them expendable.   &quot;Why should anyone hire a Turk when they can get a skilledEast German for the same price?&quot; asks Mehmet Kabuk, whomigrated from Anatolia to West Berlin 20 years ago.   Mr. Kabuk runs a kebab shop in Kreutzberg, a Turkishenclave abutting the Wall and crowded with mosques,belly-dance clubs and butchers selling meat slaughteredaccording to Islamic rules. For Turkish migrants, this littleIstanbul was once the Promised Land. In his 20s, Mr. Kabukopened his own shop, and at 31 he now clears the equivalentof $2,500 a month, four times what he could earn in Turkey.He has a new Mercedes parked out front. &quot;My mother said we'deat three or four eggs a day in Berlin and watch TV,&quot; Mr.Kabuk recalls. &quot;She was right.&quot;   When the Wall was breached last fall, Mr. Kabuk handed outfree shish kebab to the East Germans flooding in and lookedforward to a boom in his business. But in the months since,he has often been abused by German customers, and he has evenscuffled with them in his shop. Then, one day, he woke tofind &quot;Turks Out]&quot; painted on the wall of a kindergarten byhis house, beside a crude sketch of a child hanging from agallows. He has decided to take his wife and two Berlin-bornchildren back to Turkey, but he worries about the adjustmentafter so many years abroad. &quot;We are foreigners in bothlands,&quot; he says.   Turkish alienation, and anxiety, have fueled the rise ofTurkish street gangs. Wearing American football jerseys andadopting names such as the Vikings, Black Panthers and CrazyKick Brothers, they are being blamed for a wave of assaultsand petty crimes in West Berlin. Right-wing skinheads are afavored target.   &quot;If any Nazis come near here now,&quot; says a gang membernamed Ali, running a finger along his throat, &quot;we'll showthem a little Islamic justice.&quot; He adds, &quot;I hear it is easyto get guns in America. Can you bring some next time youcome?&quot;                                                                                                          France                                                                                                          France, like Germany, has a large foreign community thatnow feels under siege. Immigrants -- largely North African --make up about 8% of France's 55 million people. France alsohas Europe's strongest anti-immigration movement, Jean-MarieLe Pen's National Front.   &quot;If integration between Islamic immigrants and the Frenchwere possible, it would have happened already,&quot; says Mr. LePen, speaking from his luxurious villa near Paris. Hissolution to the immigration problem: &quot;We must make thesepeople go back to their homes.&quot;   Dismissed as a racist fringe group just a few years ago,the front has won seats in the European Parliament and localgovernment; it captured more than a third of the vote inworking-class districts of Marseilles. The front also isactive at the grass-roots level. Under posters saying&quot;Immigration Stop&quot; and &quot;Let's Make France for the French,&quot;the front's social workers in Marseilles hold weekly openhouses and help residents with pensions, civil-service jobsand other paper work.   &quot;No one else will help me,&quot; says Lucille Champoussin, anunemployed 60-year-old. &quot;I was born here, have lived all mylife here, and I don't have a right to anything. But theseArabs get everything. It just isn't right.&quot;   Youssef Mendani also has lived in Marseilles his wholelife and feels he hasn't had a right to much, either. The22-year-old son of Algerian immigrants shares a smallapartment with seven siblings in a housing project adjacentto a junkyard. Children play jungle gym in a burned-outdelivery truck. Young men linger idly in groups, joking inArabic that they are &quot;holding up&quot; the project's crackedconcrete walls.   Mr. Mendani finds that his French citizenship doesn't ruleout racism. He was tossed out of junior high school whenofficials restricted the number of immigrant students. Hedropped out of another school when a teacher said hisbackground suited &quot;Arab work,&quot; such as heavy labor, ratherthan the languages he wanted to study.   &quot;Everyone talks of getting out,&quot; he says, picking his wayacross the broken glass and garbage on the project's grounds.&quot;But there is no place to go.&quot;   Like many second-generation immigrants in Europe, Mr.Mendani feels caught between cultures. He doesn't want to goback to Algeria and its rising Islamic fundamentalism. But inFrance, integration seems impossible. &quot;Today is the same asyesterday, and tomorrow will be the same, too,&quot; he writes ina poem. &quot;The express train roars past less than 100 feet way.As it does, the old buildings tremble, and we do, too.&quot;   In both France and Germany, the import of foreign workershas stopped, though immigrant communities continue to growthrough births and laws allowing family reunion. Butopponents of immigration fear that the opening of Europe'sinternal borders in 1992 will bring a fresh wave of Arabs andAfricans, with Italy the principal gateway.                                                                                                          Italy                                                                                                          For decades, manpower was Italy's biggest export; anestimated 25 million Italians migrated overseas between 1870and 1970. However, economic growth and falling birth rates --as well as slim entry requirements -- have reversed thetrend. Now, Italy has about a million immigrants, andthousands more arrive each week, often illegally. &quot;TheMediterranean,&quot; says Italy's foreign minister, Gianni deMichelis, &quot;is our Rio Grande.&quot;   In the hot kitchen of a Milanese restaurant, a cook in atomato-spattered apron tosses spaghetti into boiling waterand stirs a pan of pesto. The cook is an agriculturalengineer from Egypt; so is the dishwasher working beside him.   &quot;Young Italians would rather steal than do kitchen work,&quot;says the restaurant's owner, Andrea Ferrari-Nasi. Hiringimmigrants hasn't hurt his business; the restaurant, which isawarded one fork in the Michelin guide, is packed untilmidnight.   Mr. Ferrari-Nasi, though, says language and culturaldifferences -- Muslims don't like handling pork, for example-- make it hard to train Arabs. So, when planning to open asecond restaurant, he advertised for an Italian cook, waiterand dishwasher. Two months later, he has received only oneresponse. &quot;Every restaurant owner I know has the sameproblem,&quot; he says.   So do many other employers in Milan. A bakers' associationrecently offered to train 5,000 immigrants for jobs itcouldn't fill. So did a merchants' group. Not surprisingly,immigrants flock to the prosperous city from other parts ofItaly, especially Genoa, where ferries from North Africadisgorge hundreds of newcomers each weekend. Milan now has anestimated 70,000 foreign workers, up from about 5,000 justtwo years ago.   The influx has overwhelmed Italy's lumbering bureaucracy,and baton-wielding police have beaten back restive migrantslined up each dawn to apply for working papers. The massinflux has created social strains, too. An abandoned farmnear Milan, where 700 Moroccans live in stables and share twoportable toilets, has had three mysterious fires this year;officials suspect arson by right-wing Italians. When the cityproposed moving homeless immigrants to tent camps on itsoutskirts, local residents blockaded the streets, and thecity backed off.   Roberto Formigoni, a Christian Democrat from Milan and avice president in the European Parliament, blames much ofthis friction on &quot;campanilismo&quot; -- roughly, &quot;worship of one'sown church spire.&quot;   &quot;There is a long tradition in Italy of regarding anyonefrom outside your own village with suspicion,&quot; he says.Earlier in the postwar period, northern Italians directedthis provincialism at poor migrants from the south. Now, theyfeel threatened by Africans and Arabs.   In Florence, anger at foreign street merchants boiled overthis spring, and several immigrants were severely beaten. Amonth later in Genoa, a deranged Tunisian's assault on asmall girl sparked two days of vigilante reprisals; residentsthrew bottles and set guard dogs on North Africans. TheMilan-based Lombard League, which seeks regional autonomy andtough curbs on immigration, captured 19% of the vote inregional elections in May -- second only to the ChristianDemocrats.   The Italian government has tried to walk a tightropebetween native anger and the need for good relations with itsMediterranean neighbors. New laws this February offeredamnesty to immigrants in the country before 1990 buttightened restrictions on newcomers and set large penaltiesfor employers who hire illegals. Under pressure from theEuropean Community, Spain also is tightening entryrequirements for Moroccans and Latin Americans.   The Italian demographer, Mr. Livi-Bacci, views the trendto restricting immigration as short-sighted. As Europe'spopulation ages, he says, the need for working-age migrantsis sure to increase. And he adds that blocking immigrationcould roil countries such as Egypt and Morocco, which relyheavily on remittances from workers abroad.   In the Loreto subway station in Milan, it is easy todiscern the new Europe that anti-immigrationists fear. Everynoon, Senegalese migrants gather at a cafe there to exchangeletters from home and information about jobs and housing. Inone corner, an Italian-speaking migrant helps a newcomer fillout a form for a merchant's license. In another, two men withbraided hair and African robes discuss going to Belgium,where pay is said to be high.   &quot;A lot of people in Senegal have never heard of Rome, buteveryone knows Loreto,&quot; says Youssoupha Kalla, a streetmerchant in Italy for two years. &quot;This is the place you cometo get rich.&quot;   Mr. Kalla, 26, has a wife and child in Senegal, and sevensiblings -- one already in Italy, another in France. He hadhoped to bring the rest of his family to Italy but delayedhis plans because of a recent crackdown on street peddlers inMilan. Now jobless and bothered by the rising racial tension,he is thinking of returning to Senegal -- but just for a fewmonths.   &quot;I need Italy, and Italy needs people like me,&quot; he says,folding up his newspaper. &quot;I will be back.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
