The banks' efforts have escalated as advertising revenueshave fallen at TV and radio stations, threatening the owners'ability to repay their bank debt. The lenders say they wantsecurity in the licenses because the licenses are considereda broadcast station's most valuable asset.</LP><TEXT>   The issue was highlighted earlier this week when TakCommunications Inc., the owner of nine TV and radio stations,said its reorganization plan for emerging frombankruptcy-court protection could be jeopardized by lenders'attempts to gain a security interest in the company'slicenses.   The company's lenders, led by Chemical Banking Corp.'sChemical Bank unit and the recently failed Bank of NewEngland, are seeking to enforce the portions of their loanagreements that expressly include all of Tak's licenses assecurity for $168.8 million in loans.   Tak, based in Vienna, Va., argues that, despite thewording of the agreements, the banks can't claim a securityinterest in its licenses under longstanding policies of theFederal Communications Commission. FCC staff attorney AlanGlasser said the commission has traditionally taken a dimview of lenders having security interests in licenses because&quot;the licensee is supposed to have complete discretion overhow the station is operated.&quot;   A lender with a security interest in a license couldpotentially pressure a broadcaster to change programming, Mr.Glasser suggested. Furthermore, foreclosure on a troubledbroadcaster could shift full control of a station to alender, violating the FCC's mandate to screen all licenseholders, he said.   But Tak's lenders, and at least a dozen others, say infilings with the FCC that recent court rulings have misreadprevious FCC decisions and wrongly interpreted them asprohibiting security interests in broadcast licenses. Theywant the FCC to clarify its position and to permit thesecurity interests.   The FCC hasn't said whether it will address theloan-security issue, which was formally raised in a filing inFebruary by the Washington, D.C., law firm of Hogan andamp;Hartson. The firm represents a number of banks andcommunications companies but won't identify a specific clientin connection with its request that the FCC approve the useof licenses as security.   &quot;There is no reason why banks and other third partylenders shouldn't be allowed to have a security interest aslong as there isn't a transfer of the license without priorapproval of the FCC,&quot; said Marvin J. Diamond, a partner atthe law firm. Hogan andamp; Hartson's position has since beenbacked in filings by several lenders.   Loan agreements with broadcasting companies usually listthe companies' licenses as security and specifically statethat any transfer is subject to FCC approval, according toPeter A. Fine, a Boston lawyer for New Bank of New England,the government-controlled successor to Bank of New England.&quot;Because of the onward and upward nature of the{broadcasting} industry for so long, there were fewinstances where that {agreement} got tested,&quot; Mr. Fine said.   Few broadcasters or other license holders have weighedinto the dispute. The National Association of Broadcasterssaid it sees good and bad in granting lenders an interest inlicenses and has asked the FCC to consider the issue in aformal rule-making procedure to give its members moreopportunity to register their opinions. The Wireless CableAssociation, a trade group for microwave video distributorswho compete against cable TV companies, told the FCC theysupport the lenders' effort.   But Tak maintains that &quot;it would represent a startlingdevelopment if the FCC changed its policy to permit financialinstitutions to hold a security interest in licenses issuedby the federal government to use the limited electromagneticspectrum that `belongs to the public.'&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
