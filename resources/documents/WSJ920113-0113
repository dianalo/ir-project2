The nation's securities firms increasingly are hatchingpay packages that reward brokers for staying at their firms.The pay plans run from deferring bonuses and delayingcommission payouts to making longevity awards.</LP><TEXT>   Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. is the latest bigbrokerage firm to adopt the trend. Starting this month, thePrimerica Corp. unit will withhold 1% of its brokers'commissions for four years, according to an internal SmithBarney memo. After that time, brokers will receive thewithheld commissions, plus a small bonus. The directive atSmith Barney follows various deferred-pay plans at MerrillLynch andamp; Co., Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. and PaineWebberGroup Inc., among others.   The aim, of course, is to keep brokers focused on thelonger term. Broker turnover historically is quite heavy;often 20% of Wall Street brokers bolt their firms in a singleyear. Brokerage firms are determined to keep brokers frommoving, particularly as they continue to dole out fatup-front bonuses to lure new brokers. And keeping brokers isespecially important now that brokerage firms are activelyhiring again as small investors get back in the markets.   Generally, the plans could be good news for investors.When brokers leave, a fight often erupts for the broker'sbook of clients. Brokers try to keep their customer lists;firms often take steps to keep them. And when investors holdproprietary, or in-house, mutual funds, the situation getssticky because firms often make it difficult to transferthese investments to another firm.   Here's how the Smith Barney plan works: Starting thisyear, brokers who generate more than $150,000 in annualcommissions will have 1% of their commissions withheld forfour years. After then, Smith Barney will give brokers abonus of 50% of their 1992 deferred pay.   The firm also will give brokers bonuses if they remainmore than three years and meet certain production goals, andmore if they bring in big amounts of customer assets or largeadditions to proprietary mutual funds.   The Smith Barney plan is a twist on deferred compensationplans launched last year by Merrill and Shearson. At Merrill,every broker will receive a Merrill &quot;investment certificate&quot;worth $100,000. The certificates mature in 10 years. At thattime, brokers who have met certain performance goals and whohaven't had major compliance problems will be eligible toreceive the payment.   At Shearson, brokers who stay at the firm for five yearswill be eligible to receive a bonus equal to 4% of theirgross revenue production, up to $80,000. But brokers won't beeligible if they have abused clients or don't meet certainproduction goals.   &quot;If you build your business and run it in a professionalway, you'll be around to pick up your deferred compensation,&quot;said Joseph J. Plumeri, president of Shearson's privateclient group.   At PaineWebber, brokers can earn as much as 2% of theircommissions if they remain for at least three years andproduce a minimum of $300,000 in annual commissions.   &quot;It's not big enough to call it a `golden handcuff,'&quot; saidJoseph Grano, president of PaineWebber's brokerageoperations. &quot;What it really is is a recognition of loyaltyand longevity.&quot;   Some smaller firms already have similar programs in place.Raymond James Financial Inc., a St. Petersburg, Fla.,regional brokerage firm, credits 3% of its brokers'production for those who generate more than $150,000 inannual commissions. Brokers can't get a hold of this moneyfor eight years, and get the full amount only when theyretire. The plan &quot;acts as a deterrant for broker's movement,and it's a nice little bonus for them to take,&quot; said ThomasA. James, chairman.</TEXT></DOC>
