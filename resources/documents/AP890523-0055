The warning came less than a week after a Frankfurt courtconvicted Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, of murderand air piracy in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner andsentenced him to life imprisonment.   Officials said after Wednesday's verdict that Hamadi's sentenceraised the danger of attacks by terrorists on West German targets.   The latest warning did not specify the reasons for the alert. Itcame shortly before the start of the busy summer tourist seasonthat further strains the nation's already crowded major airports.   The warning was disclosed in a statement released by theBavarian Transport Ministry. It said the warning came from thefederal Interior Ministry and was sent to all West German regionalauthorities and airports in the country.   ``The danger of attacks against air traffic has risenrecently,'' the Bavarian statement said, summarizing theinformation it had received from federal security officials.   The statement did not say if authorities had specificinformation about an impending attack.   Bernd Lenze, spokesman for the Bavarian Transport Ministry,declined to discuss the reasons that led to tighter airportsecurity.   Lenze also refused to give details about the security measuresauthorities were taking.   But the statement said airport security staff were told toconduct more elaborate inspections of luggage and passengers willhave to count on longer check-in times.   After the verdict in Hamadi's trial, the West German ForeignMinistry warned its diplomats to be on the alert for possibleretaliation.   Newspaper reports also said authorities were on the lookout forpossible terrorist action at home following Hamadi's sentencing.   The Frankfurt court ruled that Hamadi was a member of Hezbollah,or Party of God. The radical Shiite Moslem group is backed by Iranand is believed to be holding Western hostages in Beirut.   The court said Hamadi had been in contact with Hezbollahterrorists operating in Europe before his arrest at Frankfurtairport in January 1987. Hamadi was convicted of the hijacking andslaying of U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem.   Two West German relief workers are still missing in Lebanonafter reportedly being kidnapped the day before Hamadi's sentencing.   A terrorist bombing is believed responsible for the Dec. 7 crashof Pan Am Flight 103, which blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland,killing 270 people. The flight originated in Frankfurt and changedplanes in London.</TEXT></DOC>
