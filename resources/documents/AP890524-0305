It was the first time this year that the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries reported a supply level above theceiling set in an agreement covering output for the first sixmonths of 1989.   Private analysts have detected a recent pickup in production byOPEC nations.   Subroto, secretary-general of the 13-nation oil organization,urged the producers to try ``to sustain the present hard-wonstability in the market.''   ``Production restraint by all producers, both inside and outsideOPEC, is still necessary in view of the fragility of the presentprice structure,'' he was quoted as saying in a statement issued bythe OPEC News Agency.   The statement said 12 of the 13 members poured 17.54 millionbarrels a day into the international market last month.   The production agreement for the first half of 1989 sets asupply target of 17.51 million barrels a day for the 12 members.   OPEC said total production by the dozen nations amounted to18.47 million barrels a day in April. Figures were not availablefor the United Arab Emirates, it said.   ``The so-called OPEC overproduction to which the media has beencalling attention has not been supplied to the market, but has goneinto building stocks, in a concerted effort by member countries notto destabilize the market,'' the cartel said.   ``During January to April, the 12 countries added nearly 70million barrels to their stocks _ 38.3 million barrels to stocksheld abroad and 31.6 million to those within national boundaries,''it said.   Analysts have attributed the recent increase in productionpartly to an effort by OPEC nations to stake out positions inadvance of a key meeting next month in Vienna. At that gathering,the oil chiefs will agree on a production level for the second halfof the year and set individual quotas for each country.   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, analysts say, want a biggershare of the overall ceiling negotiated by the producers.   The International Energy Agency, in its Monthly Oil MarketReport, estimated OPEC output at 20.5 million barrels a day inApril, up from 19.8 million barrels the previous month.   The current accord, worked out in late November, set aproduction limit of 18.5 million barrels a day for the entirecartel. OPEC measures a nation's quota by figuring crude productionand the amount of oil put into, or drawn out, of stocks.   The output ceiling, well under December levels, was set in aneffort to boost prices to a target of 18 dollars a barrel.   Prices soared beyond that benchmark, although the rally haseased a bit recently. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkAmerican crude, has been trading in the range of 19 dollars to 20dollars a barrel.   The price surge has been attributed not only to OPEC'sproduction cuts but also to accidents in oil-producing areas thathave reduced the supply in the world market.</TEXT></DOC>
