One of the earliestexamples of sulphur dioxide damage crossing international boundarieswas the Trail, British Columbia smelter case in the 1930s. Sulphur dioxideemissions were reduced at the Canadian smelter to protect the environmenton the United States side of the border. Studies of environmental damagefrom acidification by acid deposition in Canada date from the 1950s and60s. In the late 1960s, acidification of surface waters and other formsof environmental damage, near point source emissions in Canada and theUnited States, led to development of Clean Air Acts in both countriesand the implementation of various control programs. The aquatic environmenthas responded favourably to these emission reductions. However, biologicalsurveys have documented a continuing decline in biological quality oflakes and the loss of aquatic organisms as a result of period pH depressionsin streams. While emissions and depositions have been reduced and waterquality have improved, the situation is still far from acceptable. 15refs., 8 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
