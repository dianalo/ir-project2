(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United Mine Workers union planned toput a new offer on the table today in its 3{-month-old strikeagainst the Pittston Coal Group Inc., a union official said.   Violence again punctuated the strike Thursday when two statetroopers were struck by rocks as they drove behind coal trucks intheir cruiser, police said today. One of the officers fired inself-defense, but there were no serious injuries in the incident,which resulted in 42 arrests, police said.   Late this morning, UMW spokesman Joe Corcoran refused to discussterms of the proposal, saying he was late to catch a plane.Corcoran said Thursday that the offer would be made today, thethird day of talks that resumed Wednesday following a six-weekhiatus.   The desk at the motel here at which the talks were to take placeconfirmed that a Pittston-UMW meeting was under way this afternoon,but UMW district headquarters in Castlewood could not confirm thatthe offer had actually been presented.   Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn visited the southwest Virginiacoalfields Thursday and today to throw his support behind theunion. He told miners that political leaders should help ``protectlegitimate gains which workers have made.''   The Boston City Council Wednesday night gave a vice president ofa Boston bank, who is a Pittston director, seven days to takeaction on ending the strike. If not, the council threatened toremove about $20 million in city funds from Shawmut Bank. WilliamCraig, bank vice president, said he was planning a statement urginga fair resolution of the dispute.   Pittston Coal Group spokeswoman Susan Copeland declined tocomment on Flynn's visit.   Staff members of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Labor ManagementRelations also were in the coalfields Thursday interviewing minersand family members. The subcommittee members were to talk to thecoal company today.   Also Thursday, 11 Pittston operations were hit by a power outagecaused when several utility poles were damaged. Police said theutility poles were damaged by gunfire, a chainsaw and an explosion.   Miners struck Pittston on April 5 over wages and benefits,eventually idling 1,900 miners in Virginia, West Virginia andKentucky. Talks broke down last month, but resumed Wednesday aftera private meeting between both sides in a federal judge's chambers.   The union wants the president of The Pittston Co., Greenwich,Conn.-based parent company of the coal group, to enter face-to-facenegotiations with UMW President Richard Trumka. Paul Douglas hasdeclined, saying local management is authorized to negotiate acontract.   Pittston wants a contract differing from that reached in 1988between the UMW and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association.Pittston no longer belongs to the industry group and wants moreflexibility in its contract, including dropping a industrywidepension plan.   The union wants a contract identical to the BOAC contract.   In June, wildcat strikes in support of Pittston miners began inWest Virginia, eventually spreading to 10 states east of theMississippi River putting nearly 46,000 miners off the job andseverely reducing production.   Most of the wildcat strikers returned to work this week.   Westmoreland Coal Co. announced Thursday that it was laying off88 of its 782 employees in Virginia, partially because of lostorders during recent wildcat strikes by miners supporting thePittston walkout.   The attack on the troopers occurred Thursday afternoon outsideClinchco, near the Kentucky line, said state police spokesmanCharles Vaughan. He said the troopers had gotten out of their cars,and one had suffered cuts and brusises from rocks when one officeropened fire. None of the rock-throwers was injured, Vaughan said.   ``While state police vehicles have been hit by rocks previously,this was the first actual assault on uniformed officers,'' Vaughansaid.   The troopers were accompanying coal trucks, which UMW members orsupporters have been trying to block. Vaughan said 42 people werecharged with conspiracy to commit a felony _ throwing missiles atan occupied vehicle. He said 39 were from Ohio, two were from WestVirginia and one was from Virginia.</TEXT></DOC>
