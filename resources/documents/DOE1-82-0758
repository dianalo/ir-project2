Investigationsof the vanadium catalyst showed that crystallization of inactive compoundsof quadrivalent vanadium, resulting in decrease of the reaction rate,occurs at low temperatures and SO{sub 2} conversions. The authors studiedthe K{sub 2}S{sub 2}O{sub 7}-VOSO{sub 4} system, and also spent vanadiumcatalysts of low activity after use under production conditions, in orderto determine the state of quadrivalent vanadium during low-temperaturedeactivation. Thermographic and x-ray diffraction methods were used.It has been shown that deactivation of vanadium catalysts may be causedby crystallization of compounds of the K{sub 2}S{sub 2}O{sub 7}-VOSO{sub4} system; decrease of temperature to 673 K and lower at low partialpressures of sulfur trioxide creates the most favorable conditions forthis type of deactivation.</TEXT></DOC>
