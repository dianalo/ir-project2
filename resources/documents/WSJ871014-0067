Underscoring tensions between the Pentagon and officers assigned to the White House, Adm. Crowe said he wasn't informed of the operation until after two major weapons transactions had been completed in 1986. Even then, he said, he was alerted only inadvertently.    The top Naval officer said the decision to sidestep the Pentagon's top officials, which circumvented normal procedures, was made at a level below President Reagan. And he criticized fellow military men at the National Security Council for trying to &quot;keep dissent out of the decision-making calculus.&quot;    &quot;It was my reluctant conclusion that there were military people on the NSC that in certain instances were willing to . . . say, 'Well, we will provide the military advice,'&quot; Adm. Crowe testified. &quot;I didn't necessarily appreciate that.&quot;    Adm. Crowe's remarks are contained in a previously classified deposition released by House and Senate investigators. They represent the most complete account yet of his view of the Iran-Contra affair. Testimony by the joint chiefs chairman, who never was questioned during the Tower Commission investigation last winter, is significant principally for the insights it provides into interactions within the military.    Prior testimony has established that Adm. Crowe's predecessor, Gen. John Vessey, similarly was excluded by the NSC from information regarding Saudi aid to Nicaraguan insurgents in 1984 and 1985, and only learned of the assistance from the Saudis themselves. Throughout this period, the NSC staff was dominated to an unusual degree by military officers, and one theme in the congressional inquiry is the extent to which this concentration affected administration policy-making.    U.S. weapon sales to Iran were authorized under a finding signed by President Reagan in January 1986, and major shipments followed in February and May of that year. By virtue of his position, Adm. Crowe was an adviser to the NSC, yet he testified that he didn't know about the sales until late June or early July 1986.    He was informed by his special assistant, Lt. Gen. John Moellering, who had heard references to the arms sales at a meeting of an administration working group on terrorism. The admiral testified the he was &quot;startled&quot; by the information, but when he raised the issue subsequently with Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, he was told that a &quot;conscious decision had been made that it was not a military matter.&quot;    The chairman of the joint chiefs said he thought then the initiative was winding down, but the record shows further shipments were made in August and October last year. Prior to direct U.S. involvement in the shipments, American-made weapons had been shipped from Israeli stocks in 1985, and Adm. Crowe admitted it was &quot;quite astounding&quot; that the Defense Security Assistance Administration within the Pentagon was unaware of these shipments.    Adm. Crowe's tenure as chairman of the joint chiefs coincided with the beginning of a general relaxation of a congressional ban on military aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. The U.S. was permitted to share intelligence with the insurgents under legislation adopted before his appointment in October 1985, and documents released yesterday show that steps were taken in November 1985 to enhance the tactical information available to the anti-Sandinista guerrillas.    There is a natural rivalry between the Pentagon command and White House military advisers, but the Iran-Contra affair coincided with the rise of a clique of officers to power in the NSC -- including National Security Adviser John Poindexter, a Navy admiral, Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, and other Navy and Marine personnel.    &quot;I think the question of military officers serving on the NSC should be examined,&quot; Adm. Crowe said. &quot;I think the question should be examined primarily with a view to putting some kind of fixed limit on the term of service over there for a military officer.&quot;    At another level, the relations between Col. North and Adm. Poindexter remain a puzzle for investigators, who are uncertain how much the Marine told his superior. In December 1985, Col. North already was planning to design the Iran weapons sales to yield profits for the Contras, according to evidence provided by the Israeli government, yet Adm. Poindexter testified that Col. North never told him of the scheme until late January or February 1986.    No evidence has been found to contradict directly the admiral, but the Israeli account indicates that when Col. North met with an Israeli purchasing agent in New York in 1985, he read from a document which investigators believe has since been shredded but may have linked the scheme to higher-ups in the NSC. </TEXT></DOC>
