Gen. Ephraim Lapid told a newsconference.   He refused to confirm or deny the report in the Sunday Times ofLondon that Israeli investigators who questioned a kidnapped MoslemShiite clergyman have concluded the two Israeli soldiers are dead.   `We consider our prisoners of war ... as living until positiveevidence proves the contrary,'' Lapid said.   Israeli officials have offered to trade the cleric and hundredsof other Moslem Shiite prisoners held by Israel for the two Israeliinfantrymen, an Israeli airman, and the 16 Western hostages inLebanon.   Lebanese Shiite leaders have called for Israel to first releaseits prisoners and let Palestinian deportees return to the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip.   Lapid's news conference was called after the London newspaperreport gained widespread attention in the Israeli media.   The British weekly quoted unidentified security sources inJerusalem as saying Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has tried to keepthe two deaths a secret from the United States to avoid pressure tofree the cleric in exchange only for Western hostages.   Israeli commandos on July 28 abducted the radical Shiite cleric,Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid. Israel says he is a leader of theIranian-backed Hezbollah militia, which is believed to be anumbrella for groups holding Western hostages.   The Sunday Times quoted unidentified senior Israeli governmentsources as saying Obeid's interrogators believe the infantrymen,Yousef Fink and Rahamim Alsheik, died of wounds within hours aftertheir car was ambushed in south Lebanon in February 1986.   The London weekly said the Israeli airman, Ron Arad, who wasshot down in October 1986, is believed to be alive and held by aLebanese militia with closer ties to Syria than Iran.   The newspaper said Israeli military officials had told theparents of Fink and Alsheik that their sons were dead. The Israelidaily Yediot Ahronot quoted both families as denying the report.   There are 16 Western hostages in Lebanon, including eightAmericans. The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985.</TEXT></DOC>
