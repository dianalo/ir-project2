 Perhaps this is because of the larger diskdrives often available for network storage on platforms other than the Mac.andO;Perhaps it is because Apple has made connectivity easy to accomplish bycreating network-ready systems.andP;  Perhaps it is just because of the cultfollowing Macintoshes seem to have--users who just have to have a Mac.andO;Whatever the case, connectivity products are available to connect Macs to avariety of other platforms.andM;Cayman Systems offers one such product, GatorShare, that facilitates filesharing over a Network File System (NFS) network.andP;  With this connectivity,administrators can establish a common e-mail system, provide large amounts ofstorage space for Macs to share data among themselves, and even provide ameans of sharing data between Unix and Mac users.andP;  While it is up toindividual applications to translate data from one platform to another,GatorShare can translate Unix text files into a more readable format for theMac.andM;One feature of GatorShare is that it runs on the Cayman Systems' GatorBox.andO;The GatorBox acts as a gateway between LocalTalk and Ethernet.andP;  An advantageof this system is that it requires no additional software on the client orhost computer.andP;  Yet some users might consider requiring proprietary hardwarea disadvantage.andM;Start a ProgramandM;To install the product, the GatorBox must be attached to the LocalTalk andEthernet segments and plugged into an electrical outlet.andP;  Normally, the factthat a product has to be plugged into an electrical outlet is not worthmentioning, but in this case it is.andM;The power cube for the GatorBox is so large and heavy that it has a mountingscrew.andP;  The instructions suggest installers turn off power to the walloutlet, remove the faceplate, and replace the faceplate using the mountingscrew built into the power cube.andP;  This is a difficult to follow suggestion,since most network administrators probably don't have the authority to cutpower to circuits in their offices.andM;Also, most uninterruptable power supplies (UPSs) can't accommodate themounting screw.andP;  I had to resort to using an extension cord since I couldn'tuse the wall outlet or UPS directly.andP;  This is the first product I've seenthat the most frustrating part of the installation is plugging it into theelectric socket.andM;GatorShare's flexible user interface makes the software installation somewhattime consuming, but the menus are generally well organized.andP;  There areoptions for AppleTalk and TCP/IP routing, setting up the system from whichthe GatorBox can download information, and specifying NFS server information.andO;Within each of these categories are seemingly endless combinations of optionsincluding options to support Phase 1 and Phase 2 EtherTalk.andM;The documentation is very thorough in exemplifying a variety of setups.andO;Unfortunately, it does not provide much information to help you decide whichoption you should accept.andP;  For example, it shows how to set up the system forPhase 1 only, Phase 2 only, and a combination of the two, but it does notexplain how to decide which you need to install.andP;  The technical supportrepresentative I spoke with tipped me off that because my EtherTalk file wasdated 1988 it must be Phase 1; Phase 2 was introduced in 1989.andP;  One sentencein the documentation would eliminate the need for a phone call to technicalsupport.andM;GatorShare can be configured to support three different methods of uservalidation.andP;  It supports Yellow Pages, the centralized database of NFSnetwork information.andP;  For this setup, the administrator needs only to specifythe Yellow Pages domain.andP;  User verification can also be based on a server's/etc/passwd and /etc/group files.andP;  This requires that the /etc directory beaccessible through the list of exported file systems.andP;  The third method ofuser authentication supports the Sun Microsystems PC-NFS daemon.andP;  This daemonprovides for authentication of Macintosh users by the same method as forPC-NFS users and does not require that Yellow Pages be implemented or that/etc be available through the exports list.andM;Get It TogetherandM;Users attach to the network through the Apple Chooser.andP;  After a user selectsthe AppleShare icon, he can select a zone and server.andP;  From there, he entersuser name and password.andP;  Since Unix supports a greater number of charactersin a password than AppleShare does, GatorShare authorizes the connectionaccording to the first eight characters only.andP;  The user can then select fromthe list of available volumes to mount.andP;  The administrator determines whatvolumes are available during the GatorShare and NFS server configurations.andO;The file systems listed in the /etc/exports file will be available unless theadministrator removes them from the GatorShare list.andP;  Of course, anyspecified mount points must be in an exported file system for a user toaccess them.andM;Once a volume is mounted on the Macintosh, an icon appears on the user'sdesktop through which the volume can be accessed.andP;  If the administrator hasassigned a password to the volume, the user will be prompted before the iconis displayed.andM;Users and system administrators will notice a difference between theavailable space reported by the Mac's Get Info command and the Unix system'sdf command.andP;  According to the technical support representative at Cayman, thedifference results from Unix reserving 10 percent of its disk space forsystem use.andP;  According to Unix manual pages, the 10 percent is taken from theamount of available disk space and does not affect the amount of spacereported as used.andP;  When I compared the numbers reported for the rootdirectory structure, Unix reported approximately 6,722,975 bytes and theMacintosh reported 7,496,704 bytes used.andP;  This difference is not too extreme,but when I compared the numbers for the /home file system, Unix reported12,876,050 while the Mac reported 26,649,600 bytes used.andP;  This difference istoo great for me to have confidence in the numbers reported on the Mac side.andM;An important consideration in configuring GatorShare is what to do aboutcharacters in file names that are not available on Unix.andP;  Some Macintoshapplications use the trademark and registered symbols in filenames.andO;GatorShare offers an option to rectify this among low-level settings such aswhat prefix should be used for AppleDouble resource files.andP;  To address theproblem of unavailable characters, GatorShare allows administrators tospecify characters that, if found in a file name, will prevent users frombeing able to create the files on the Unix host.andP;  With Sun OS 4.0, invalidcharacters are translated to a question mark, so I did not have to set up alist on my system.andP;  Since preventing these files from being created can keepusers from installing applications directly on the host volumes, Caymanpromises in the documentation to have a better solution to the problem infuture releases.andM;Learn to ShareandM;Macintosh files can be stored in two fashions, AppleSingle and AppleDouble.andO;GatorShare allows network administrators to specify which format will be usedwhen files are saved to any shared directory.andP;  Different directories canstore data in different fashions.andP;  AppleSingle, which stores data andresource information in a single file, can be used for compactly storingfiles that will be accessed only by Macintosh systems.andP;  AppleDouble, whichstores data and resource information in separate files, should be used forstoring files in directories that may be accessed by non-Macintosh systems.andM;GatorShare only provides translation for Unix text files, and the only thingtranslated is the end-of-line character.andP;  The system administrator has theoption to specify whether text conversion should be available for a volume ornot.andP;  Without it, Unix text files appear to have no line breaks.andO;Unfortunately, DOS files shared via Sun's PC-NFS on the same network requireno text conversion.andP;  The DOS files can be properly read by Unix applications,but appear double spaced in Macintosh applications if GatorShare's textconversion is active.andP;  Because GatorShare allows administrators to activateand deactivate text conversion on each mounted volume, volumes can be set-upspecifically to retrieve PC-NFS files and Unix files separately.andM;Another option provided to accommodate Unix allows administrators to specifyfor each volume whether invisible files can be viewed.andP;  In Unix, files with aleading &quot;.&quot; in the name do not appear in directory listings unlessspecifically requested.andP;  GatorShare does not display these files by default,but can be configured to display them.andM;I tried a quick test run of the system by copying MacWrite II onto the serverfrom one of the Macs.andP;  After copying the folder, I had to log on to theserver to change permissions on all the associated files and directories sothe application could be accessed by more than just the owner.andP;  Once thepermissions were set, two users could run MacWrite II and share data files.andO;If one user had a file opened, the other user was locked out and couldn'taccess it.andM;While GatorShare does not support background printing, the GatorBox doesprovide EtherTalk users with access to LocalTalk printers.andP;  Also, theupcoming version of GatorShare will support GatorPrint and enable Unix usersto access LocalTalk printers.andM;Invest in SecurityandM;GatorShare claims to support AppleShare security on the Macintosh side ofthings and NFS security conventions on the NFS server side.andP;  Both systemssupport security assignments for owners, groups, and everyone else.andP;  NFSsecurity settings determine whether users have read, write, or executepermission for files and directories.andP;  On the AppleShare client side,permissions specify if folders and files can be seen and modified.andP;  Becauseof the different security schemes, some permission restrictions don'ttranslate as one would expect.andP;  Since AppleShare doesn't support file levelsecurity, files are either accessible or not.andP;  The general rule is that readand execute is the minimum required permission on the Unix side for Macintoshusers to have access.andM;For directories and folders, the translation scheme is more difficult.andP;  Readaccess translates to &quot;See Files,&quot; write to &quot;Make Changes,&quot; and executetranslates to &quot;See Folders.&quot;andP;  If a user has no access rights, the Macintoshfolder appears grey and cannot be opened or written to.andP;  While this seemscorrect, interesting problems occurred when I tried it out.andM;Using Sun OS 4.0.3, a user with read permission in a directory can list filesand directories within that file system, but cannot change to the read-onlydirectory or retrieve any information about files and directories within thefile system.andP;  On the Macintosh, the same user actually can open the folderrepresenting that directory but can see only the first item in the directory.andM;I created a directory dir.r.o so the owner had complete access and the groupand others had only read access.andP;  A Unix user other than the owner listed thecontents of the directory and saw that, alphabetically, the subdirectory dirappears first.andP;  The same user on a Macintosh opened the folder icon fordir.r.o and saw an icon for dir.andP;  Unfortunately, no other icons for the fileswithin dir.r.o appeared, and the icon for dir incorrectly represented it as afile rather than as a folder.andM;Also, the security icons in the upper left window border for dir.r.oindicated that the user cannot write in the folder and cannot see folderswithin that folder.andP;  I thought it was an interesting error that the only iconin the window actually represented a directory although the window indicatedthat I could not see directories.andM;The engineer at Cayman that I spoke with attributed the incorrect icon toUnix returning &quot;Permission denied&quot; errors when GatorShare passes the requestfrom AppleShare for information.andP;  AppleShare has no way of discovering thatthe item is a directory and so defaults to a file icon.andP;  He could not explainwhy AppleShare only displayed one of the items from the read-only directory,though.andM;Next, I tried to set up a directory on Unix that would act as an AppleShareDropbox.andP;  Dropboxes are folders where users can copy information, but userscan't retrieve data from them.andP;  On my Unix system, a directory for whichusers have only write and execute permission acted perfectly well as aDropbox.andP;  Users were able to copy files into the directory, but could not geta listing of the directory contents.andM;I named the directory dir.wx.o.andP;  On the Mac, the folder representing thisdirectory was not grayed-out as inaccessible folders typically are, and itdidn't have an arrow above it to indicate that I could copy data to it.andP;  Thisis because the permissions translated to &quot;See Files&quot; and &quot;Make Changes&quot; onthe AppleShare side of things.andP;  When I tried to copy a file into the folder,I receive a message notifying me that I wouldn't be able to retrieve the fileif I copied it into that folder.andP;  This is the message I expected to see witha Dropbox.andP;  When I clicked on &quot;OK&quot; to continue, I was notified that I didn'thave appropriate access rights.andM;A directory for which users have only write access, dir.w.o, appeared on theMacintosh as a grayed-out folder with an arrow above it.andP;  This iconrepresents a Dropbox.andP;  When I tried to copy a file to this directory in Unix,I did not have the appropriate permission.andP;  When I tried to copy a file intothe folder on the Macintosh, I again received the message that I did not haveappropriate rights.andM;The Cayman engineer that I spoke with attributed these errors to AppleSharerequesting information about a directory's contents before allowing users toopen it or even to write to it.andP;  Unix will not return any information aboutthe directory's contents if there is no read permission available.andM;The reasons given for why each of these problems occurred seem correct:GatorShare respects the Unix permissions.andP;  Unfortunately, GatorShare does notmake an effort to accurately represent these permissions on the Macintoshside.andP;  If users cannot access directories to which they do not have at leastread-and-execute permission, then the directories should not be representedwith icons that indicate they are accessible to Macintosh users.andO;Unfortunately, the folks at Cayman Systems left AppleShare users with plainfolders that appear to be accessible but cannot be opened, searched, orwritten to; with folders that appear to be Dropboxes, but cannot be writtento; and with folders that appear not to have &quot;See Folders&quot; access but whichdisplay a folder as a file.andP;  Cayman needs to implement a more sophisticatedtranslation scheme so Mac users receive the appropriate visual clues andaccess rights information for inaccessible directories on the Unix system.andM;In addition to file and directory level security, Unix allows for security tobe assigned to volumes for export as well.andP;  NFS supports a variety of accesssettings in the /etc/exports file, including the ability to export a filesystem as read only.andP;  When I exported /etc as read only, it was representedappropriately on the Macintosh as lacking &quot;Make Changes&quot; permission.andO;Exporting the file system as read only allowed me to change the GatorSharemethod of user authentication to reference these files rather than YellowPages without giving users the ability to alter important system files inthat directory.andM;Additional security is available through GatorShare.andP;  This includes passwordprotection on shared volumes and Name Binding Protocol (NBP) filtering fornetwork resources.andP;  Because GatorShare only supports one list of sharedvolumes for all users attached to a single GatorBox, passwords may beassigned to keep users who share a GatorBox from mounting volumes that theydon't need to access.andP;  These volumes appear in the user's list of sharedvolumes, but won't mount automatically on start-up.andP;  If a user attempts tomount one of these volumes after start-up, he will be prompted to enter theappropriate password.andP;  NBP filtering allows administrators to limit theresources users can access.andP;  Users can be limited to resources within a zone,all LaserWriters can be protected from users in other zones, and selectedprinters and servers can be protected from users in other zones.andM;Analyze the SituationandM;GatorShare responds well to server errors, and it did not even timeoutconnections when the server was down momentarily.andP;  If errors do occur,GatorShare offers troubleshooting techniques including the ability to viewsystem statistics with GatorKeeper on a Macintosh and to log into theGatorBox and query its logs.andP;  GatorKeeper statistics include memory usage andsystem load.andP;  With one Macintosh user running applications on and copyingfiles to the NFS server, GatorKeeper reported that the GatorBox was 96percent idle.andP;  System logs available by logging onto the GatorBox withTelnet, an NCSA application supplied with the GatorBox, include current usersand their mounted volumes and AppleTalk Link Access Protocol (ALAP)statistics.andP;  Some of the information available through GatorKeeper is alsoavailable when you login to the GatorBox with Telnet.andP;  In both cases,administrators can display a crash signature or memory dump to help diagnoseproblems if they occur.andM;Given the ease with which GatorShare and GatorBox integrate Macintoshes intoan NFS network, the flaw in security representations on the Macintosh side ofoperations can almost be overlooked.andP;  GatorShare helps network administratorsmake ends meet when it comes to sharing data and resources across Macintoshand NFS platforms, and it does so almost seamlessly.andM;What They Tell YouandM;GatorBox and GatorShare 1.5.1 Cayman SystemsandM;Price: $2,795 for the GatorBox and $1,995 for GatorShare.andM;Description: GatorBox acts as an AppleTalk routing mechanism while GatorShareprovides Macintosh to NFS connectivity.andP;
