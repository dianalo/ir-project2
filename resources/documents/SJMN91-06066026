Later delays occurred when councilmembers Gary Mello, Kurt Roessler and Alane Loisel suggested additionalsites.;    Loisel last week suggested 2.8 acres on Warm Springs Court. Citystaff members recommend two acres on Brown Road.;    The coalition's board ofdirectors decided Monday that the Warm Springs Court property was unsuitable.;   But Jeff Neuman-Lee, representing the Rev. Tom Sims, the coalition'spresident, asked the council on Tuesday to delay a vote for one week. Sims wasunable to attend the meeting.;    'Everything is so confusing';  &quot;Everythingis so confusing,&quot; Neuman-Lee said after the council voted unanimously to grantthe delay. &quot;One week was not enough to investigate the (Warm Springs Court)site.&quot;;    The owner of the Warm Springs Court property is willing to sell theentire parcel for $949,769 or one acre for $438,214. The price of the BrownRoad site is $698,000.;    But a city staff report said the Warm Springs siteis farther from bus routes, lacks complete sidewalks and is near companiesthat have hazardous materials. Heavy traffic along Warm Springs Boulevard is apotential safety hazard, the report said.;    One unanswered question iswhether the owners of the Brown Road site will extend the city's option on theproperty after granting two previous extensions. The option is to expireFriday.;    Light-hearted gesture;  Phil Ockerman, a longtime communityactivist, gave the council a chuckle Tuesday night when he presented a $100check toward the shelter &quot;if we have a positive decision today.&quot; If not, heasked City Clerk Sharon Whitten to tear up the check.;    Later he added, witha big grin, &quot;I meant if all five of you would vote the same way.&quot;;    Underthe existing proposal, the city would build a 70-bed shelter that would haveseparate living and eating facilities: one for families and the other forsingle adults.;    But Loisel and council allies Mello and Roessler in recentweeks have questioned the size of the project.;    Mello and Roessler saidthey believe the majority of the community will support a shelter with about40 beds for families. While they say constituents whom they have talked tooppose a shelter for single adults, no one has publicly expressed that view.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DENNIS AKIZUKI, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910306  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  424  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday March 6, 199100066026,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
