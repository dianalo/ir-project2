The fieldof catalytic hydrogenation is so wide and publications are so numerousthat the need for a comprehensive review is obvious to thoroughly updatethe literature. This book consists of four parts and is divided into18 chapters written by 36 scientists who are the top experts of theirfields. Topics include: the kinetics of heterogeneous hydrogenation oforganic compounds; synergy in catalytic reactions involving hydrogenand the possible role of surface-mobile species; the adsorption and hydrogenationof carbonyl and related compounds on transition metal catalysts; thehydrogenation of nitriles; the hydrogenolysis of C-C bonds on platinum-basedbimetallic catalysts; the hydrogenative denitrogenation of model compoundsas related to the refining of liquid fuels; the effect of catalyst compositionon reaction networks in hydrodesulfurization; the carrier effect on hydrogenationproperties of metals; role of bimetallic catalysts in catalytic hydrogenationand hydrogenolysis; supported mono- and bimetallic catalysts in hydrocarbonconversions; supported bimetallic catalysts prepared by controlled surfacereactions; new supported metallic nickel systems; supported metal complexesas hydrogenation catalysts; a study on supported asymmetric hydrogenationcatalysts; the liquid-phase hydrogenation and the role of mass and heattransfer in slurry reactors; the application of fixed-bed reactors toliquid-phase hydrogenation; a review on the control of hydrogenationautoclaves; and the selective hydrogenation applied to the refining ofpetrochemical raw materials produced by steam cracking.</TEXT></DOC>
