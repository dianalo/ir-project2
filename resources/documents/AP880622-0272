But the no-smoking signs were soon removed when free-spendingforeign tobacco buyers threatened to boycott the hotel.   While government and private agencies vigorously crusade againstpublic smoking, the tobacco industry is a king-size earner ofexport income for Zimbabwe, formerly the British colony Rhodesia.   Anti-smoking lobbies here concede their efforts have not becomea burning issue at a time when smoking in public is being stubbedout in many parts of the world.   ``Our lobbying is gaining little ground because of the economicimportance of tobacco and because people are not aware of thedangers,'' observes Kindness Paradza, research officer at theprivately funded Zimbabwe Consumer Council. ``One of our main aimsis to stop children from smoking.''   ``We are very much affected by the anti-smoking campaign,'' saysMaurice Rooney, chief executive of the Tobacco Industry Council(TIC), the umbrella body for private companies in Zimbabwe. ``Everycigarette not smoked simply means less business for us.''   Rooney, a non-smoker, sits at a desk with a calendar publishedby the Montreal-based Smokers' Freedom Society featuring cartooncaricatures of great men in history puffing on cigarettes andcigars _ among them Winston Churchill, Sigmund Freud, Orson Welles,Oscar Wilde and Vincent van Gogh.   Official statistics offer a clue to the importance of tobacco inZimbabwe, the world's third biggest exporter.   The annual crop of 100,000 ton earns 22 percent of all exportincome, accounts for 12 percent of the gross domestic product andkeeps a tenth of all employed Zimbabweans in jobs, from pickers onthe tobacco farms to sales teams that travel the world.   The industry also pumps $24 million annually in excise dutiesinto the state coffers, revenues that help finance the socialistgovernment's education and health programs.   While President Robert Mugabe discourages smoking in hispresence he boosted the 900 full-time commercial growers' moralewhen he officially opened the $10 million-Willowvale auctioncomplex in Harare, the Zimbabwe capital, two years ago.   ``When we were growing up our parents ... and teachers forbadeus to smoke,'' Mugabe said. ``But one thing they never said was,`Don't sell tobacco.' If we sell it we must grow it as well. It isour industry, and we must support it.''   The World Health Organization, which spearheads globalanti-smoking campaigns, takes a back seat in Zimbabwe. ``We don'tget involved in that sphere,'' a WHO spokesman said in Harare.   Private tobacco companies routinely spend hundreds of thousandsof dollars each year promoting sporting events, including soccerclubs in poor black residential areas.   The industry also helps fund the local Cancer Association, anindependent organization, to the extent that it recently decidedagainst pressing for a national symbolic no-smoking day.   Smoking is banned in cinemas and theaters, but for safety nothealth reasons.   One restaurant in Harare reserves four tables for non-smokers.   But cigarettes are permitted on public buses, the state airlineand even in some doctors' waiting rooms.   While lobbies caution on radio, television and in newspapersabout the reported hazards of smoking, local manufacturersadvertise freely in the media and are not required to carry healthwarnings on cigarette packs.   Researchers estimate that half of the men in this country of 8.2million people are smokers who pay about 50 cents for packs of 20cigarettes. But they consume only 2 percent of all tobacco grown inZimbabwe.   About half of all tobacco exports are sold to European countrieswhere manufacturers fear tougher curbs coupled with a growinganti-social stigma toward smokers will shrink the market.   As a result, the exporters are looking more to Africa and theFar East to keep sales up.   ``If every Chinese smoked one more cigarette a day,'' saysJeremy Webb-Martin, president of the Tobacco Trade Association,``our problems would be over.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Tues PMs June 28</NOTE></DOC>
