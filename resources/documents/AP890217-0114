(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Air Force's powerful new Titan 4rocket will carry a huge new missile-warning satellite when itblasts off on its maiden flight next month, an industry magazinereported Friday.   Aviation Week andamp; Space Technology said the 5,200-pound satelliteis the third generation of Defense Support Program payloads designedto give the United States instant alert of a missile attack.   The magazine said in a report to be published in its Feb. 20issue that nine of the new DSP satellites, costing $180 millioneach, will be launched over the next several years.   It said the satellite has an advanced infrared telescope todetect the heat exhaust of a missile rising after launch from landor sea.   While missile warning is the payload's primary role, AviationWeek said the satellite also will provide intelligence on routineSoviet and Chinese missile test firings and space launches.   It also is expected to be able to detect the heat from militaryaircraft when they fly with their afterburners on for higher speed.   The magazine said the satellite has new survivability features,including a system to protect it from ground-based lasers.   Thirteen early model DSP satellites have been launched by the AirForce since 1971.   The Titan 4, the largest of three rocket systems the Air Forceordered to lessen its dependency on NASA's space shuttle after the1986 Challenger explosion, is scheduled for launch in mid-March.</TEXT></DOC>
