Gold prices fell in domestic trading after rising overseas.Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid of $438.35 forone troy ounce of gold, down from Wednesday's late bid of $440.25.   The foreign exchange market largely ignored a hike in a keylending rate by several U.S. commercial banks as the dollar settledabove the pscyhologically important barrier of 1.8500 West Germanmarks despite central bank intervention. The dollar had not closedat these levels since last August.   Traders said the market is focused primarily on the CommerceDepartment's release on Friday of U.S. merchandise trade data forMay. Concern over the report also dominated the currency markets inEurope, where the dollar finished mostly higher in light dealings.   ``The market is still bullish (about the dollar) even if thenumber does come in at $11.5 billion,'' said Cynthia Johnson, vicepresident and foreign exchange manager at Lloyds Bank PLC's NorthAmerican office in New York.   The trade deficit registered a narrow $9.9 billion in April, butthe consensus in the market is that a single-digit figure isunlikely for May.   Traders said the Federal Reserve stepped in when the dollarreached 1.8500 West German marks in an attempt to stem its rise.One trader said the U.S. central bank sold ``quite a substantialamount'' of dollars during the intervention.   A trader in Frankfurt predicted ``massive'' intervention by boththe West German and U.S. central banks in the event of alower-than-expected deficit, which would help push the dollarhigher.   Several U.S. banks announced a half a percentage point increasein the prime rate, putting the key lending rate at 9.5 percent, itshighest level in more than two years. But there was little reactionin the market.   ``The prime rate hike had been pretty much expected,'' saidMichael Malpede, a senior currency analyst at Refco Group inChicago. ``The timing may have been a bit unusual, but it is alagging indicator.''   Generally, however, higher interest rates at home can be bullishfor the value of the dollar because they attract more foreigninvestment to the United States.   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business daybegins, the dollar rose 0.48 yen to a closing 132.95 Japanese yen.Later in London, it edged up to 133.12 yen.
