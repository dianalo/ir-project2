<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-44-1260 </DOCNO><TEXT>Computing at Sandia has grown with the expanding use of central mainframecomputers. Their early communication network consisted of a tree-structured,twisted-pair cable arrangement connecting a small number of remote terminalswith the central computing facility (CCF) through underground conduits.The first element of their present network, a Gandalf port contenderwas installed in 1979 to connect the rapidly expanding number of userswith the limited number of host ports at the CCF. However, with computeruse changing to interactive processing and because of Sandia's classifiedinformation requirements, the existing network was approaching saturationby 1981. Thus, installations of the primary 144-fiber trunk system oftheir very high-capacity wide-ranging optical-fiber cable and communicationnetwork was begun that year and will soon be completed in a loop 2.6miles in circumference. This communication utility will make access byterminal to computers as easy as plugging in electrical appliances ormaking a phone call. Requirements and installation of the system aredescribed. 7 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
