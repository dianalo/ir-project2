The sulfidationkinetics were parabolic in most cases, but two different diffusion processesaffect the kinetics. In the sulfidation of the Fe-Mn alloys at 973 Kand 1073 K, the diffusion of manganese atoms in the alloy is the rate-determiningstep and an interlocked scale/alloy interface is observed. At 1173 Kthere is a transition to rate-control by the diffusion of manganese inthe sulfide scale connected with transition from rugged to a planar scale/alloyinterface.</TEXT></DOC>
