Barricada, the newspaper of the governing Sandinista party, saidthe Honduran aircraft were not hit.   The paper accused Honduras of escalating tensions between thetwo countries by flying over Nicaraguan territory. A NicaraguanDefense Ministry spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,said the Hondurans ``provoked'' Nicaraguan troops into shooting atthe aircraft.   The newspaper also said the Defense Ministry reported twoshooting incidents Tuesday between Nicaraguan and Honduran troops.It said Honduran troops ``harassed'' two Nicaraguan borderobservation posts with 50- and 60-caliber machine gun fire.   In the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, armed forces spokesmanJuan Sierra Fonseca called the Barricada reports ``absolutely falseand alarming because they generate tensions in Central America.''   Eugenio Castro, spokesman with the Honduran Foreign Ministry,also denied both Barricada reports and called them ``absurd.''   Barricada said a helicopter gunship and an F-5 fighter jet fromthe Honduran air force and a twin-engine plane withoutidentification recently flew over the border towns of Santo Tomasdel Nance, San Pedro de Potrero Grande and Somotillo. It did notsay when the incident took place.   The report quoted Maj. Leonel Martinez, military commander forthe Nicaraguan provinces of Chinandega and Leon, as sayingSandinista army troops fired on the intruders with artillery androckets but failed to hit them.   Barricada said the incident heightened the possibility of amilitary confrontation between Honduras and Nicaragua.   Leftist Nicaragua and Honduras, a U.S. ally, have been at oddsfor years over the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras.The Contras have long used Honduran territory to launch attacks onNicaragua and for training, supply and base camps.   Since the end of overt U.S. military aid last February and atruce that began in March, the bulk of the Contra force has beenholed up in camps inside Honduras near the border.   But Nicaraguan officials have reported a series of borderincidents, including incursions or attempted incursions.   Martinez said the navy sank six Honduran boats trying to enterNicaraguan waters in the Gulf of Fonseca on Aug. 20. The gulfdivides Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. He said a Sandinistaarmy officer, Lt. Pablo Blanco Torres, died in the incident.   Barricada said armed U.S. vessels are common in the gulf.   The newspaper quoted another regional military commander, Col.Carlos Brenes, as saying Contras have tried to cross intoNicaraguan near the town of Palo Grande in Chinandega province.   Brenes was quoted as saying Honduran troops have been harassingthe border post at Palo Grande to provide cover for Contra rebelssneaking into Nicaragua from Honduras.   Brenes said the Hondurans have increased their troop strength inthe area, reinforcing the 101st Infantry Brigade and an armoredregiment. He said the Sandinista army has not responded with ``anyunusal military mobilization.''</TEXT></DOC>
