ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With the Democrats making final arrangementsfor their convention that will nominate Michael Dukakis forpresident, Jesse Jackson is refusing to yield on platform issues orhis claim to be the most qualified Democratic vice presidentialprospect.   ``The fact of the matter is, I would be an asset,'' Jackson saidon Tuesday. ``I'm convinced that my presence would unleash new hopein this country, regain more people.''   ``The others under consideration are unknown quantities beyondtheir districts and beyond their home states,'' Jackson said inBoston.   Ron Brown, the Washington lawyer who has emerged as Jackson'stop campaign aide, met with Democratic Party chairman Paul G. KirkJr. and Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich. The session was atDukakis campaign headquarters in Boston.   Brown described it as ``a good meeting, a good session.'' Butwhen asked if any agreement had been reached on platform issues onwhich Jackson and Dukakis differ, Brown said, ``The decision isthat we have no present intention of dropping any of them.''   The issues on which they disagree are Jackson's call for a taxincrease, for cuts in defense spending and for endorsement of anindependent Palestinian state.   Brown said further meetings would be held ``to get theconvention put together.''   The two campaigns have agreed on much of the conventionschedule, including a plan for Jackson to address the meeting onthe second night, Tuesday, July 19.   The opening night program will include a speech by formerPresident Jimmy Carter, as well as the keynote address by TexasTreasurer Ann Richards.   The third night of the convention will include the traditionalroll call ballot for the presidential nomination, with Dukakis andJackson expected to be the only names put forth. Dukakis has farmore than the delegate majority he needs to prevail.   The program for the closing night will include nomination of thevice president and then the acceptance speeches by Dukakis and hisrunning mate.   The three commercial television networks are expected to provideprime time coverage for two hours on each of the four nights.   In addition to Jackson, officials said it was possible thatformer Democratic presidential contenders Sens. Albert Gore Jr. ofTennessee and Paul Simon of Illinois; Rep. Richard Gephardt ofMissouri and former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt would speak Tuesdaynight. Onetime front-runner Gary Hart is not expected to addressthe convention; associates say he will write a newspaper column andprovide commentary for Italian television during the gathering.</TEXT></DOC>
