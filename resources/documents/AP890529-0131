This is aninsult to the national pride of Poles,'' said a governmentstatement.   ``The Polish government appeals for an immediate halt ofinterfering in the electoral campaign by some Western countries, inany form,'' said the statement that was read on state televisionand carried by the state-run news agency PAP.   The statement also charged that some Western diplomats wereactively participating in opposition election meetings andsometimes ``fulfilling instructive functions.''   It said members of the public in the United States and othercountries were raising money for the opposition and supplyingprinting machines for campaign efforts.   The government claimed that Munich-based Radio Free Europe is``conducting an electoral campaign for Solidarity for many hours aday,'' and ``the American radio station, financed by the U.S.government, is constantly instructing Poles for whom they shouldvote and especially for whom they shouldn't vote.''   Former Carter administration adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, who isvisiting Poland, was criticized for an interview he gave to theopposition's election newspaper. He was quoted as saying that aweak Solidarity showing would be a surprise and have unfavorableconsequences for Poland.   ``This is an open and simply brutal attempt of influencingresults of elections in a foreign country,'' the statement said.   Poles are to vote Sunday to fill seats in the 460-member Sejmand the 100-seat Senate.   Under the government's historic accord with the Solidarity-ledopposition, all seats in the Senate will be open to any group ororganization. In the Sejm, the opposition can seek 161 seats withthe rest reserved for the communists and their allies.   Solidarity has endorsed one candidate for each of the 261 seatsit can seek.   At a news conference in Warsaw, party Secretary ZygmuntCzarzasty criticized Solidarity instructions that voters shouldcross out all non-Solidarity candidates on Sunday.   The balloting procedure is complicated. In order to vote yes forone candidate a voter must cross out all the other names on theballot.   Solidarity's campaign literature clearly explains the procedure,but communist officials have protested that advocating that voterscross out all non-Solidarity candidates is unfair.   ``We say vote for the best and we never say, cross out these orthose,'' Czarzasty said.   For the seats set aside for the party and its allies, noSolidarity candidates are running. If more than 50 percent of thevoters cross out all the candidates on those ballots, no one wouldbe elected and some seats would simply be unfilled.   In other developments, about 400 supporters of several bannedgroups held a rally in Warsaw. Groups such as the Polish SocialistParty-Democratic Revolution and the Polish Independence Party,barred from the elections, advocate a boycott saying the electionsare not free because the communists are guaranteed a majority inthe Sejm.   Protesters shouted ``Boycott elections!'' and ``Down withcommunism!'' Police were present but no arrests were reported.   Parliament passed a law pardoning political offenses committedsince the August 1980 agreements that initially legalized theSolidarity trade union.   PAP said the law pardons and erases from the record misdemeanorsand also fiscal offenses that were politically motivated inconnection with strikes and protest actions or violations ofmilitary rules.   Solidarity, the only free union movement in the Soviet bloc, wassuspended when martial law was imposed in December 1981 andsubsequently was outlawed by Parliament. It was legalized again inApril following lengthy negotiations that also set the rules forSunday's balloting.   Thousands of union activists were arrested and many were firedfrom their jobs during the crackdown under martial law that waslifted about a year later.</TEXT></DOC>
