As a result, it was decidedthat a new organisation was needed to take responsibility for an R andD programme for the natural gas industry in the United States on a nationwidebasis. The Gas Research Institute, known by its acronym GRI, was formallyestablished in 1976, with headquarters in Chicago. It had its first fullyear of operation in 1978. A few selected research areas that are verytopical in the United States, and which are also relevant to the marketfor natural gas in many countries in Europe are discussed. These arespace cooling; co-generation; environmental control; and natural gasfor vehicles.</TEXT></DOC>
