By the end of the week, the Treasury said it would reconsider the move, but only because it was surprised to discover that Americans owned a large share of the bonds. As with Australia's surprise introduction of a withholding tax on A-dollar denominated Eurobonds one year ago, the clumsy way in which the Treasury handled the Eurobond question provides further evidence of how poorly Washington is adjusting to America's new status as an external debtor. Countries which need to import sums equal to 3% to 4% of GNP cannot afford to undermine large segments of their debt market while their senior officials explain that the move was designed to penalize foreign investors, not domestic residents. </TEXT></DOC>
