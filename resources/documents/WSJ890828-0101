WHEN JACQUES CARTIER, THE FRENCH NAVIGATOR, first sailed up the St. Lawrence River in 1535, the rapids blocked him at Montreal. The same fate awaited every ocean-going ship for the next four centuries, until the St. Lawrence Seaway was opened in 1959 with President Dwight Eisenhower and Britain's Queen Elizabeth doing the honors. The Seaway created a 2,350-mile route into mid-America.    Politics, not engineering, had kept the river blocked. The Canadians had locks around the rapids by 1903 but only for vessels up to 3,000 tons. Before World War I, a U.S.-Canadian commission recommended beating the rapids with a combined power and navigation project. Canada's Prime Minister Mackenzie King, urged on by the abiding Canadian fear of any involvement with the U.S., shelved it.    Finally, in 1954, Congress approved a power and navigation pact that let work begin on the &quot;North Coast,&quot; as Seaway boosters called the new waterway.    Unfortunately, the Seaway never lived up to its billing. Cargo ships and tankers outgrew the Seaway's 830-foot locks. The need for Labrador iron ore to replace Minnesota's dwindling Mesabi deposits -- a defense argument that Eisenhower used to great effect -- faded as steel mills on the Great Lakes became less important. General cargo went elsewhere.    By 1984, critics were calling the Seaway a billion-dollar boondoggie. Congress had to write off its original cost. Schemes for icebreakers to lengthen the Seaway's 8 1/2-month season and to enlarge the locks never materialized. But U.S. administrator James Emery says things are picking up. In 1988, Canadian grain tonnage -- 40% of the waterway's cargo -- fell 71%, but overall toonage declined only 9%. And Emery hopes to find an East Coast port to handle overseas Seaway winter traffic for onward shipment by rail. That, he says, will let his big ditch offer 12-month service, ice or no ice. </TEXT></DOC>
