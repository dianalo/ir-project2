The new deadline is Dec. 1, 1987, rather than Jan. 1, 1992, and will affect an estimated 2,400 small aircraft. Already, all aircraft operating at the nation's nine busiest airports and all commercial airliners must be equipped with the devices, known as Mode C transponders. The transponders are estimated to cost $800 to $1,500 each.    In another development, the General Accounting Office, the congressional watchdog agency, said that the Federal Aviation Administration's long-term effort to modernize obsolete equipment is 10 years behind in some programs, hurting the agency's ability to &quot;maintain the margin of safety.&quot;    Herbert McLure, an associate GAO director, testified before the Senate Aviation Subcommittee that major parts of the National Airspace System plan -- the FAA's $16 billion blueprint for safety and productivity improvements -- won't be available until the late 1990s. That raises the specter of the air-traffic control work force being stretched thin for years to come, he said. An FAA official said Mr. McLure was overstating the delays.    On the altitude-reporting equipment, Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole said the new rule would give controllers at busy airports &quot;a continuous readout of aircraft altitude, a more complete view of traffic and improved control.&quot;    The rule will apply to restricted airspace, known as terminal control areas, around airports in Cleveland; Denver; Detroit; Honolulu; Kansas City, Mo; Houston; Las Vegas, Nev.; Minneapolis; New Orleans; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Seattle; St. Louis; and San Diego. The devices already are required in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco and Washington.    The new rule immediately ran into flak from the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the Frederick, Md., group that represents 260,000 private pilots. Edmund Pinto, senior vice president, said the association agrees that the equipment should be required for some of the 14 airports cited by the department, but not for all of them.    In some cases, Mr. Pinto contended, the extra information provided by the altitude-reporting transponders would overwhelm the FAA's work force and computers -- an assertion the agency denies.    The department's new rule also requires that all transponders installed in aircraft after Jan. 1, 1992, be compatible with a new radar-beacon system that will be installed in the future. The radar system will give controllers more accurate data on an aircraft's position and identification.    Because the new system will allow controllers to address each aircraft individually, it also will eliminate the sometimes-garbled and overlapping messages that occur in the current system. Now, all aircraft are &quot;interrogated&quot; at the same time and respond almost simultaneously, the department said.    Mr. McLure of the GAO, in his congressional testimony, said that the FAA's modernization plan is from one to 10 years behind schedule, depending on the individual program involved. The delays, he said, are the result of premature commitments by the FAA to particular systems that are taking longer than expected to develop.    He also said the GAO can't assess the effectiveness of the FAA's inspections program because data collection on inspections is haphazard. &quot;The FAA still doesn't have the kind of reliable information that allows them to look back over the course of a year and determine how individual carriers are doing or how the industry is doing,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
