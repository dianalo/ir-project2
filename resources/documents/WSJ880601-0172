Meanwhile, Alan Bond's Bond Corp. raised its stake in Bell Resources to 6.9% from 3.2%, which some analysts viewed as a move to gain control of the Australian investment company. Bond didn't disclose how much it paid for the shares.    Bell Resources was controlled by Australian financier Robert Holmes a Court. But Mr. Holmes a Court said in April that he intended to sell most of his 46% holding in Bell Group Ltd., which in turn owns 43% of Bell Resources, to Bond and the State Government Insurance Commission of Western Australia. Bond acquired 19.9% of Bell Group from Mr. Holmes a Court in April for 2.70 Australian dollars a share (US$2.18).    Australia's National Companies and Securities Commission is conducting hearings into whether control of Bell Group changed hands without a full takeover offer being made to all shareholders. No new directors are to be appointed to either Bell company until the hearings are completed.    Mr. Holmes a Court said Bell Resources has an uncertain future. Its directors appointed an investment bank to advise them. The company is considering a takeover bid from New Zealand investor Sir Ronald Brierley and Australian publisher Kerry Packer, who own about 7% of Bell Resources. They are offering A$1.50 a share, or A$1.04 billion (US$840 million), but a court delayed the bid Monday. Mr. Holmes a Court described the offer as &quot;inadequate.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
