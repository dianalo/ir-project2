(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jessica Hahn, whose sexual revelationstoppled PTL evangelist Jim Bakker, said Wednesday she will happilyreturn $160,000 in hush money and that she has offered to makefund-raising appearances for the beleaguered ministry.   PTL officials turned her down for fund-raising, she said.   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds in Columbia, S.C., onTuesday ordered Miss Hahn to return $160,000, including accruedinterest, from a $150,000 trust fund PTL set up for her in 1985.   PTL, which is in bankruptcy reorganization, sued Miss Hahn inApril, claiming she broke her agreement with the ministry to remainsilent about her December 1980 tryst with Bakker at a Florida hotel.   Miss Hahn said she would not challenge the order.   ``I never wanted that money,'' she said. ``All I ever wanted wasan apology.'' She said she would happily give it back to help thefinancially troubled ministry.   ``I want to see the PTL go on,'' she said. ``I feel bad thatthey have suffered the way they did.''   ``I offered to go on TV and raise funds but they don't want mebecause of my lifestyle,'' she said. ``They don't realize that thechurch is for saints and sinners.''   Bakker resigned after the PTL scandal broke last year. Miss Hahnsold her story, illustrated with semi-nude photos, to Playboymagazine for a reported $1 million.   ``God's been good to me,'' said Miss Hahn, a former Long Islandchurch secretary.   After Bakker resigned in March 1987, it was revealed that he andhis wife, Tammy, had received millions of dollars in salaries andbonuses from PTL.   The television ministry filed for reorganization underbankruptcy law last year with $130 million in debts.   Hahn's transaction, as well as other Bakker financial dealingsat PTL, are being investigated by a federal grand jury for possibletax fraud.   Miss Hahn said she would make more revelations about ``otherpeople in my life'' in the September issue of Playboy. She said shewould be on the cover ``wearing not much.''   ``I'm learning to turn the other cheek and get on with mylife,'' Miss Hahn said a hotel in Hollywood, Calif.   She said she recently moved out of the Playboy Mansion in LosAngeles because she wanted to learn to be on her own.</TEXT></DOC>
