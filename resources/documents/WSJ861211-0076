Adds Daisy Hsin-I Pen, executive secretary of the Democratic Progressive Party, the newly permitted opposition group: &quot;People who live in Taiwan have no confidence about Taiwan's future. The U.S. attitude becomes more and more friendly to mainland China. We don't think we have enough power, and in international society, we have no status.&quot;    Despite rapid economic growth, private capital investment in the island territory fell 9% last year; more than three-fourths of the young people who leave Taiwan to study take up permanent residence abroad. An increasing number of families have at least one member with established foreign residence that could allow the entire family to leave, if necessary.    Disquiet about Taiwan's future began in earnest in late 1978, when the U.S. announced it would switch diplomatic recognition of China from Taiwan's Nationalist regime to the Communist government in Peking on Jan. 1, 1979. Taiwan has continued to stoutly resist China's entreaties to reunify. But as momentum for reunification picks up, fear is spreading here that Taiwan won't be able to control the outcome. Despite Taiwan's prosperity, relative to China, and a continuing economic boom, there is growing unease about the future.    They (the People's Republic of China) are trying to bring us to the end of our rope,&quot; says John H. Chang, Taiwan's vice foreign affairs minister. &quot;The U.S. assists them to offset the Soviet threat through military support, but we will be the target. If we merge with the mainland, we will become a drop of blue in a bottle of red ink. We would vanish.&quot;    Peking's increasing international influence and its persistent campaign for reunification with Taiwan heightens this discomfort, particularly at a time when Taipei appears ready to ease almost four decades of martial law and allow more opposition politicians to take part in government. (Elections earlier this month saw opposition politicians win 12 of 73 available seats in Taiwan's lawmaking Legislative Yuan, the first time an opposition party was allowed to challenge the Nationalists.)    Britain's decision to return Hong Kong to China in 1997 also caused tremors in Taiwan; many here viewed it as an attempt by Britain to appease Peking -- and they hope the U.S. won't follow suit by abandoning what is left of Washington's commitment to help Taiwan protect itself against a military takeover by Peking.    Some here believe Taiwan's Nationalist government may be forced to reassess its long-held position that it represents all of China. First proclaimed in 1949 when the Nationalists fled here from the mainland, the fiction still is promulgated by octogenarians who roll up in wheelchairs to Nationalist Party and legislative meetings to represent provinces in China where they haven't set foot for at least 37 years.    The U.S. has contradictory commitments. An August 1982 communique promises Peking that Washington will &quot;gradually reduce&quot; arms deliveries to Taiwan. Yet the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act assures Taipei that the U.S. will safeguard the country's security. A U.S. congressional lobby, albeit not as strong as it once was, supports Taiwan and its heels-in resistance to reunification.    Still, &quot;there is a great sensitivity toward the American role that almost borders on paranoia,&quot; says one Western representative here. One reason is that nearly 50% of Taiwan's exports go to the U.S., making the island America's fifth-largest trading partner. When the U.S. shifted support from Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos, the leadership here was shaken. &quot;They believe we don't value friendship much,&quot; says an American.    Washington and Taipei are currently embroiled in what Taiwan's Defense Minister Wang Tao-yuan calls &quot;highly sensitive negotiations&quot; over U.S. military supplies. The talks primarily concern selling defensive &quot;fast frigates&quot; or the technology to manufacture them in Taiwan. Taipei has also sought U.S. F-20 jet fighters or aircraft technology so it can build its own advanced fighter. China holds open the threat of force against Taiwan if it refuses reunification &quot;for a long period of time,&quot; although most analysts note that China doesn't have the military capability to invade the island.    Under pressure from Peking to end military sales to Taiwan, the U.S. repeatedly has denied Taiwan's requests to purchase sophisticated fighters. It has transferred limited amounts of military technology to Taiwan, but Taipei officials sense a growing reluctance by the U.S. to provide such support. Taiwan is trying to develop its own military industry.    Meanwhile, China has been trying to draw Taiwan closer by encouraging indirect trade and other contacts between the island and the mainland. Peking officials view the negotiated return to Taiwan of a China Airlines cargo plane that was diverted to Canton by its co-pilot, as a significant breakthrough. Taiwan opposition politicians see the event as proof that talks with mainlanders can be productive.    To show flexibility, Peking has proposed a &quot;one country, two systems&quot; policy that would achieve reunification by making Taiwan a &quot;special administrative region&quot; with its own military, economic system and independent contacts with foreign governments.    Peking has tried to make it easier for Chiang Ching-kuo, Taiwan's president, to accept this &quot;golden opportunity&quot;: Whereas mainland historians used to excoriate the president's father, Chiang Kai-shek, for refusing to engage invading Japanese forces in the 1930s and 1940s, they now speak of the late generalissimo's &quot;patriotic spirit and personal sacrifices.&quot;    If sentimental reconciliation doesn't work, China hopes greed will. It's wooing Taiwan businessmen with its potentially rich market and raw materials. For several years, Peking has been encouraging indirect trade, especially through Hong Kong. Such trade exceeds $1.5 billion annually, triple what it was three years ago.    Taiwan authorities are nervous enough about the trade that this year they sentenced several businessmen to jail for as many as 12 years for trading directly with China. Meanwhile Taiwan-made products, with labels intact, can be seen throughout China, while unmarked mainland goods are common in Taiwan.    &quot;Many Taiwanese businessmen hope the government will change its policy,&quot; says Lin Jong-shong, a Taiwan University economist who has been writing position papers for the newly created opposition party. &quot;The Chinese, however, are pursuing trade ties to promote reunification. They could get anything they buy from Taiwan companies from other sources.&quot;    The opposition is prepared to wait for change. &quot;Reunification can't happen now, but perhaps someday,&quot; says You Ching, an opposition leader and member of parliament who believes the mainland must first raise its living standards considerably. He advocates parliamentary exchanges, then mail and telephone links, followed by trade and political discussions.    For now, the Taipei government isn't budging. &quot;We have been firm in the past four decades and never allowed the spread of Communist thought,&quot; says Vice Foreign Minister Chang. &quot;That's the real secret of our success. Look at the problems in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and at the Philippines. You see how badly the Philippines is troubled. We feel safe and secure from this Communist infiltration.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
