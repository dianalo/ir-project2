The consortium consists of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Corp.,International Business Machines, and the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology.   Other companies, universities, and government institutions willbe invited to join the consortium, the three said.   Superconductors are ceramic materials that are cooled to beyondminus 200 degrees Fahrenheit, at which point they can letelectricity pass through them without resistance.   Both the United States and Japan are researching superconductorsand if they are developed, they could have a wide variety ofcommercial applications.   The United States now has an advantage in basic research onsuperconductors. The consortium's goal is to make sure Americanfirms, rather than those from Japan, have the advantage incommercial application of the research.   ``This will be a consortium of open communication among theresearchers involved,'' the three organizations said in a jointstatement. ``The combining of their scientific knowledge and theirknowledge of applications will benefit the nation.''   The new organization will be called the Consortium forSuperconducting Electronics. Researchers will remain at theirpresent locations but will share information.   According to The Washington Post, the group was formed at theadvice of the White House Science Council, which said in Januarythat such an organization was needed if the United States wanted toavoid what occurred in laser and videotape technology.   Both were created in the United States but were commerciallyexploited by Japan.   The consortium announced that research efforts will beconcentrated in four areas, including signal distribution;high-temperature materials and technology; advanced devices andintegrated circuits; and junctions.   The consortium will focus on applying superconductor technologyto high-speed microelectronic devices for use in computers,telecommunications and military systems, the New York Timesreported in Wednesday's editions.   ``It is a model of how universities, government labs andindustry have to cooperate in the future to address a number ofissues,'' MIT Provost John Deutch told the Times.   Ralph E. Gomory, IBM senior vice president for science andtechnology, said the consortium would seek $4 million to $6 millionin financing from a Defense Department research agency, most ofwhich would go to MIT.   IBM and ATandamp;T already have substantial programs insuperconductivity, the Times said.   Robert C. Dynes, director of chemical physics research at ATandamp;TBell Laboratories, told the Times that consortium organizersthought having big organizations involved would give the groupweight to attract other members.   ``I don't regard this as the big guys banding together andwiping out the little guys as much as giving the little guys anability to get in the same building as us,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
