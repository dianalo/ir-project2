Allen Olson, assistant commissioner of GSA'sInformation Resources Management Service.andP;  He told the Government OperationsSubcommittee on National Security and Legislation that no specific GSAreviews of schedule purchases are available, but the agency does look atthese buys generally in its periodic reviews of each agency's ADP buyingpractices.andM;Specific purchases through schedule contracts are reviewed only if GSAreceives complaints from other vendors, Olson said.andP;  GSA officials have beenconsidering undertaking periodic reviews, he said.andM;Conyers said he was outraged.andM;&quot;So if a vendor doesn't squeal on another vendor then nothing ever happens,&quot;he said.andP;  &quot;There's no independent review going on in the government.&quot;andM;The subcommittee's interest in the schedule contracts evolved from itsinvestigation into allegations that Navy officials favor IBM Corp. equipmentin procurements.andP;  The committee looked into whether Navy officials misusedthe schedules to avoid competitive procurements.andM;IBM has roughly $700 million to $800 million in annual sales through itsschedule contract.andP;  Hardware accounts for about $500 million of that total.andM;The possible Buy American and used-equipment violations have been known toGSA officials for nearly a year and a half, since IBM officials reported tothe GSA inspector general that they had found problems in equipment providedthrough the schedule contracts.andM;IBM officials told the IG's office in February 1987 that they had initiatedan internal investigation using outside counsel and found the company hadsupplied used equipment as new, said Edward F. Hefferon, GSA's assistantinspector general for auditing.andM;IBM told GSA in March of 1988 that it had mistakenly certified parts of someequipment as American-made when they came from offshore suppliers, he said.andM;GSA investigators are reviewing contracts back to 1980, when IBM first beganusing foreign suppliers extensively, said Joel Gally, counsel to the GSAinspector general.andP;  The office has discussed the possible violations with theJustice Department and its prosecutors.andM;IBM officials told GSA the violations were not intentional, and they havebeen cooperating in the IG's review, Gally said.andP;  Since discovering theproblems, top IBM officials have assured GSA that no further violations haveoccurred, he said.andM;An IBM statement said, &quot;The problems, which were minor in scope, were causedby administrative errors and not by any intent to deceive the government.&quot;andM;Though the used equipment was reconditioned and warranted as new, IBM offeredto pay the government a settlement for the difference between the price ofnew equipment and the book-value price of the equipment the governmentreceived.andM;IBM offered $736,000 at first but has raised the figure since as itsinvestigation turned up more used products its supplied on the contracts.andO;The current offer stands at $1.5 million.andM;No settlement negotiations involved the possible Buy American violations.andM;Conyers said he was not so sure about IBM's motives and called the charges&quot;extraordinary.&quot;andP;  Offering his own scenario, Conyers said he thinks IBMlawyers tried to cover up the company's &quot;crimes&quot; with a settlement offer of&quot;700,000 lousy bucks.&quot;andM;If the company were found to have deceived the government intentionally, itcould be fined or barred from doing further business with the government.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
