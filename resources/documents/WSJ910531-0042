The union said it petitioned the National Labor RelationsBoard yesterday for a representation election for the 2,300pilots who fly for Memphis, Tenn.-based Federal. Unionorganizers said that more than two-thirds of the eligiblepilots signed cards requesting an election.</LP><TEXT>   If the pilots do join the union, Federal -- long known forthe tough demands it places on workers -- could loseflexibility in scheduling, seniority and pay decisions. Andother employees could be emboldened to seek unionrepresentation.   The pilots association lost a 1989 battle to organizeFederal Express's pilots when only 709 of the 2,022 eligibleaviators voted for union representation. Since then, theair-express giant has posted losses and gone through intensecost-cutting.   The pilots who joined Federal when the company boughtTiger International Inc. in 1989 lean toward unionrepresentation because Tiger had a pilot's union. But GregoryChappars, a Boeing 727 captain on the Federal pilotsorganizing committee, claims that 70% of the &quot;purple&quot; pilots-- those who were with Federal before the merger -- nowsupport a union. That compares with 1% at the time of thelast election, he said.   James L. Barksdale, chief operating officer of FederalExpress, said the pilots association effort has been &quot;losingsteam&quot; and that some of the pilots who signed cards have hadsecond thoughts.   &quot;Perhaps ALPA feels it should move now,&quot; Mr. Barsdale saidin a statement. &quot;One thing for sure is that it isn't overyet. The company will defend its position and its record.&quot;   Mr. Chappars said the pilots are upset about Federal'swork-rule changes involving pay, retirement and vacationbenefits.   Federal's founder, Frederick W. Smith, has been able tokeep unions out by designing an elaborate grievance system.The company shuns layoffs, gives out awards for workperformed well, and has an &quot;open-door&quot; policy for voicingcomplaints.   But says Mr. Chappars: &quot;The open-door policy was realeffective when it was a 400-pilot flying club. . . . But now,there are so many tiers of bureaucracy that the opendoorpolicy is invariably an unresponsive thing.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
