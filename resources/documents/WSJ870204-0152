The constitution won easy passage despite campaigns against it both by right-wing groups, many of them loyal to former President Ferdinand Marcos, and left-wing groups, including the insurgent New People's Army. The vote seems to show how little support either extreme has and should make it easier for Mrs. Aquino to dismiss their demands.    Election tallies are delivered by boat, horseback and bicycle, among other means, and complete results of Sunday's vote aren't expected for several more days. But the private National Movement for Free Elections yesterday said its unofficial count from slightly more than half of the nation's precincts showed 78.5% of the voters supporting the constitution. Mrs. Aquino's advisers had predicted a 60% majority a few weeks ago, and then raised the projection to 70% after the president turned back another coup attempt last week.    The vote was in sharp contrast to the vote on the last previous constitution, which Mr. Marcos wrote in 1973 after declaring martial law. In that exercise, the military organized public assemblies that approved the charter by a show of hands.    Sunday's vote will make it easier for Mrs. Aquino to resume the fight against the communist insurgents. Public opinion in the early months of her presidency demanded she try to make peace with the rebels. But the insurgents withdrew from peace talks last week, the referendum shows they have declining support, and Mrs. Aquino can respond to growing moderate frustration with the left by taking a harder line.    On the political right, the interim vote results showed strong opposition to the constitution at some military bases. But the referendum is a clear message that moderate voters want Mrs. Aquino to get tough with the right as well as the left.    The president's determined stand during the latest coup attempt -- she demanded the court-martial of rebel soldiers and the filing of criminal charges against civilians involved in the coup -- rallied fence-sitters who have criticized her for being weak and indecisive.    Although Mrs. Aquino's performance was the only real issue in the election -- the constitution itself was little debated -- the charter contains a provision on U.S. military bases that could prove troublesome to Washington. The U.S. currently maintains Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station in the Philippines under an agreement that Mr. Marcos regularly extended in exchange for military aid.    The current extension expires in 1992, and the constitution requires a new agreement -- not just an extension -- and its approval by Philippine voters.    Mrs. Aquino said when she took office that she would put a new treaty covering the bases to a public vote, and since then she hasn't shown any opposition to the facilities. The bases provide thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in much-needed aid, and many political observers think voters would handily approve a new treaty.    The constitution also declares the Philippines a nuclear-free zone -- meaning the U.S. couldn't store nuclear weapons at either base after 1992. Anti-nuclear sentiment is strong here -- the Philippines suffered deeply in World War II and fears becoming caught in another confrontation between super-powers.    Opponents of the constitution warn that because the U.S. refuses to say if its bases do or don't store nuclear weapons, it could be compelled to abandon its facilities.    But the consitution gives Mrs. Aquino wide discretionary powers over nuclear weapons on the bases, her advisers have assured the U.S. The document provides that the president can allow nuclear weapons on the bases if she decides it is in the &quot;national interest.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
