In June, voters handed the Labor Party its third consecutive electoral drubbing, returning Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party to power for a third term. Now, a growing number of Labor officials want a re-examination of the party's position. &quot;Unless the Labor Party is prepared to modify certain of its policies, it just will not get into government,&quot; frets Bill Jordan, president of the moderate engineers' labor union.    The party begins the long process of revitalizing itself at its annual conference opening Monday in Brighton. The gathering should prove even more raucous than normal, with the biggest fireworks reserved for the debate on Labor's controversial defense policy, which calls for unilateral nuclear disarmament and the closure of U.S. nuclear bases in Britain.    To regain power, Labor must broaden its appeal to Britain's increasingly prosperous and professional workers. &quot;We haven't really developed an adequate answer to Thatcherism,&quot; says Tom Sawyer, chairman of Labor's home-policy committee. &quot;People {now} feel able to be more self-reliant than they did. We seem like a party that wants to take {Britain} back to the past.&quot;    Without some fire from Labor, Mrs. Thatcher's right-wing Tories could govern for decades. But there is even more to lose than elections. Labor could lose its status as the main opposition party and fade into political obscurity. &quot;At this point in our history we're at a watershed,&quot; says one party official. &quot;We won't have many more chances at second place.&quot;    Major policy reversals aren't likely at next week's convention. The party awaits the outcome of disarmament talks between the U.S. and the Soviet Union that could determine which U.S. nuclear weapons are stationed in Britain. Labor also wants to review its stand on domestic issues. Nevertheless, the talks will be &quot;the foundations on which the {policy} edifice can be constructed over the next four years,&quot; says Roy Hattersley, Labor's deputy leader.    Fundamental change won't come without sacrificing some traditional Labor ideals. That won't be easy. Most party officials, including Mr. Hattersley, remain committed to redistributing the country's wealth. Neil Kinnock, the party's popular leader, ardently opposes nuclear weapons. And Labor has a small but vocal far-left wing vowing to fight any efforts to reverse socialist policies.    But the party at least is finally taking account of the Thatcher Revolution -- the vast economic and social changes wrought in Britain during Mrs. Thatcher's eight years of leadership.    The need for reappraisal was obvious after June's parliamentary election. Following its slickest campaign in years, Labor won just 32% of the vote -- above the 28% it drew in 1983, but still low enough to give Mrs. Thatcher's Tories a 101-seat majority in the House of Commons.    Labor had a few bright spots. It won big in Scotland and northern England, two areas ravaged by unemployment, forcing Mrs. Thatcher to put Scotland and innercity regeneration at the top of her third-term political agenda.    But Labor's power base among the industrial working class is eroding rapidly, thanks partly to Mrs. Thatcher, who has broken the once-formidable labor unions by restricting their ability to strike. Britain's declining manufacturing base has also cut union membership, while the sale of huge chunks of government-owned companies to the private sector tripled the ranks of British shareholders to about nine million. What's more, Mrs. Thatcher's government has attacked a cornerstone of the &quot;welfare state&quot; by selling a million government-owned houses to their residents.    Mrs. Thatcher &quot;has redrawn the political landscape,&quot; says Gillian Peele, an Oxford University politics fellow. &quot;Old-fashioned socialism -- nationalization, lots of power to the trade unions -- nobody wants to see that back again,&quot; she says.    Many party stalwarts agree. &quot;What the Labor Party has got to recognize is, working people themselves have changed,&quot; says Mr. Jordan of the engineers' union.    Labor's anti-nuclear defense policy also is a loser and was the biggest single factor behind Labor's election defeat, says Eric Hammond, president of the moderate electricians' and plumbers' union. &quot;Unilateralism just doesn't strike a chord with the middle section of the British people,&quot; he says. &quot;So do we stay with a policy that guarantees us defeat? Or do we look at what our people want, and change?&quot;    Mr. Hammond believes a majority of the party opposes the anti-nuclear policy, and he wants to ballot members on the issue. But any effort to change the defense policy faces a major hurdle: Mr. Kinnock and his wife, Glenys, are staunch opponents of nuclear weapons. He is considered a moderate and, at 45 years of age, is likely to lead the party for years. His bravura performance during the campaign added to his popularity.    Besides Mr. Kinnock, the party still has a committed far-left fringe that could block any policy reversals. Policy is broadly set by the conference delegates at their annual meeting, so speeches and disruptions by activists are important.    Alan Meale, a far-left Labor member of Parliament elected in June, is one of many planning to speak in favor of nuclear disarmament and increased social-welfare spending. &quot;What we've got to do is sell our {existing} policies&quot; to voters, he says. Reversals &quot;represent a minority viewpoint held by two or three trade-union barons&quot; and haven't &quot;a chance in hell&quot; of approval from the party's membership, he says.    Mr. Hattersley dismisses any threat from the party's left wing. &quot;They're weak in numbers, they're weaker still in influence and they're pathetically weak in intellectual clout.&quot;    Other members aren't so sure. &quot;There is a significant minority within the Labor Party who would be happy with permanent opposition so long as their so-called principles weren't sullied,&quot; Mr. Jordan says. &quot;I can't afford to disregard {those} people.&quot;    Like other Labor members, Mr. Hattersley insists Britons still want socialist government. &quot;I think it's just beginning to come back into fashion,&quot; he says.    But it is just that sort of sentiment that prompts some political observers here to conclude that Labor will never hold power again. Muses Miss Peele, the Oxford University fellow: &quot;There's a very odd death wish in the Labor Party.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
