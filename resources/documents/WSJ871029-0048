In a statement issued through its adviser, J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., the Broken Hill unit -- Melbourne-based BHP Petroleum Proprietary Ltd. -- said it had agreed to buy the stake from Volvo North America Corp., a subsidiary of AB Volvo of Sweden. BHP said it expects to complete the purchase this year, and is considering buying an additional 1% of Denver-based Hamilton, either on the open market or in private transactions.    But BHP agreed &quot;for a period of two years to certain restrictions on its ability to increase its stake beyond 50.5% on a fully diluted basis,&quot; the statement said. Also, according to the statement, Hamilton's chairman, Frederic Hamilton, deemed the agreement between the Volvo unit and BHP to be &quot;in the best interests of Hamilton Oil and all of its shareholders.&quot; Hamilton's shares, other than those owned by Volvo, are owned by Mr. Hamilton and public shareholders.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Hamilton shares closed at $18, off $4.25.    In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, the American depositary shares of Broken Hill closed at $19.375, off $1. Each American depository share equals four common shares in the Australian company.    Earlier this month, Volvo North America had signaled that it might sell Hamilton shares.    BHP's chief executive officer, Peter Willcox, said the four Hamilton board members representing Volvo would be replaced after the purchase with four BHP nominees. But he said he expects no changes in the management or operations of Hamilton as a result of BHP's buying Volvo's stake. Hamilton is engaged in world-wide crude-oil and natural-gas exploration and production.    Hamilton Oil's reserves are principally in the British sector of the North Sea, where it operates the Argyll, Innes and Duncan fields and the Esmond gas complex. Also in the North Sea, the company plans to develop the Ravenspurn North field and owns reserves in the undeveloped Bruce field. Hamilton also owns Tejas Gas Corp., which transports and processes natural gas.    BHP Petroleum owns, among other things, a 50% interest in the Gippsland oil and gas fields situated in the Bass Strait off southeast Australia. The company said those fields supply about 70% of Australia's crude-oil requirements.    In 1985 BHP acquired two U.S. oil companies -- Energy Reserves Group Inc. and Monsanto Oil Co. Those companies were merged and now operate as BHP Petroleum (Americas) Inc.    While its assets are mostly in the U.S. and Australia, BHP said it has world-wide exploration interests. </TEXT></DOC>
