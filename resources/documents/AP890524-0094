Ipray for the early time when we can go together as we have done forso long. ... I love you with all my heart.''   Claude Pepper, 88, never old enough nor lonely enough to quit,has waited for more than a decade for that time, though it mayfinally be at hand. As he lies seriously ill at Walter Reed ArmyHospital, the love letters are flooding in from a nation.   ``Perk up,'' says one card scrawled by a shaky hand. ``You workso hard, you're probably just exhausted.''   Many of the well-wishers are Americans 65 and older. GeorgeBush, who will join their ranks next month, recently paid a bedsidevisit. To senior America, the withered, dog-faced congressman fromFlorida is a peerless hero, an ever-alert guardian of the fastestgrowing and, in his view, the most commonly mistreated segment ofthe population.   The oldest member of Congress and chairman of the House RulesCommittee, Pepper is known both as Mr. Social Security and Mr.Medicaid, for his efforts to establish and strengthen bothprograms. And thanks to him, federal law now bans employers fromforcing workers to retire before age 70.   His own advice to the older set was to ``keep on doing whatyou're doing,'' but maybe at a slower pace.   ``I was playing golf one day,'' he said a few years back, ``whenI noticed my partner's clubs were lighter than mine. I found Icould handle them easier. So I changed to less weighty clubs.   ``So that's what you do in life,'' he said. ``When you come to atime when there's a need for any sort of change, simply lightenyour clubs and go right ahead.''   Despite heart surgery in 1976, despite relying on a pacemakersince 1982, despite dismal hearing and vision _ he wears a hearingaid in each ear and thick, horn-rimmed trifocals over his blue-grayeyes _ he hasn't lightened that much of his load. Thoughemotionally numbed for more than a year by the death of his wife,Pepper charged back in the 1980s, keeping long office hours andgallivanting around the country to push his own social legislationin the face of Ronald Reagan's budget cuts.   ``I've got a lot to do,'' he said. ``Except for my terribleburden of loneliness, I enjoy life. It has always been good to me.''   His legislative achievements, spanning full careers in both theSenate and House, are legend, reaching far beyond his concern forthe elderly. He fought for the first minimum wage, 25 cents anhour, in 1938. His first bill, that same year, extended federalassistance to handicapped children. He was among the first membersof Congress to support equal rights and equal pay for women.   Born in 1900 in rural Alabama, Pepper remains a pre-eminenteyewitness to America's turbulent journey through the 20th century.He was 5 years old, in 1905, when he first saw an automobile. Hewitnessed the celestial passing of Halley's Comet in 1910, andagain in 1986. He met Orville Wright, and greeted the Apollo 11crew on their return to Earth.   He stared Adolf Hitler down in a Nuremberg beer hall, sized upJoseph Stalin at the Kremlin, and earned Winston Churchill'sundying affection for casting the only vote in the Senate for theLend-Lease Act the first time around.   It has long annoyed Pepper that some of the younger generationpresume to think that he champions the elderly because he is oldhimself. He was 28 years old and a member of the Floridalegislature when he introduced a bill waiving fishing license feesfor senior citizens. He was in his 30s when he took up FranklinDelano Roosevelt's crusade for Social Security. ``I was a NewDealer,'' he has said, ``before there was a New Deal.''   One of his first bills, in 1937, created the National CancerInstitute, the first of several government centers to explore curesfor diseases that especially afflict the elderly.   He was 36 when he was elected to the Senate, where he remainedfor 14 years until his defeat in 1950 by fellow Democrat GeorgeSmathers in an extremely bitter election. After an interim andlucrative 12-year period in private law practice, Pepper has nowspent 26 years in the House.   A homely man, 5-foot-7, with a bulbous red nose and the mournfulface of a bassett hound, Pepper has lived on his dreams. As a farmboy in Dudleyville, Ala., he carved ``Claude Pepper, U.S. Senator''into a tree trunk when he was 10 years old.   While at the University of Alabama and Harvard Law School in the1920s, he waited on tables in cafeterias and emptied coal ashes ina power plant to earn his tuition. But he still managed to graduatewith top honors.   He taught law at the University of Arkansas before moving toPerry, Fla., to practice. He first race for the Senate ended in anarrow defeat, but he was elected without opposition two yearslater, in 1936. To this day, his staff and friends call him``Senator.''   When World War II broke out, Pepper, convinced that Hitler hadto be stopped, pushed for the draft and massive military assistanceto Britain. Isolationist fever still gripped most of the nation,and women's groups assailed him as a warmonger and hanged him ineffigy.   After the war, he got heat from conservatives, including JosephKennedy, father of John F. Kennedy, for having visited Stalin.Others were angry over his anti-segregation views, including hisefforts to repeal the poll tax in Florida.   According to Robert Sherrill, author of ``Gothic Politics in theDeep South,'' the campaign Smathers waged to defeat Pepper in 1950was ``the most elaborate crusade of political annihilation everconducted in Southern politics.''   Smathers' supporters attacked Pepper on the racial issue andlegend has it that Smathers would tell his less-educated audiences:``Do you know that Claude Pepper is known all over Washington as ashameless extrovert? Not only that, but this man is reliablyreported to practice nepotism with his sister-in-law, and he has asister who was once a thespian in wicked New York. Worst of all, itis an established fact that Mr. Pepper, before his marriage,habitually practiced celibacy.''   Smathers denies ever making that speech; Pepper says it wasreported at the time. ``In the vilification contest, I was like ahummingbird fallen into a nest of screech owls,'' said Pepper.   When Pepper returned to Washington 12 years later as a freshmancongressman, Joe Kennedy's son was president of the United States.``A lot more charming than the father,'' said Pepper. Now, JoeKennedy's grandson, Joseph II, is a House colleague. He called thehospital the other day to say he was pushing Pepper's home carebill.   Claude Pepper remains, it seems, a man for his own generation.And several others as well.</TEXT></DOC>
