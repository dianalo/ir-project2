According to the sources, Bush will make permanent his ban onimportation of the semiautomatic weapons that are modeled aftertheir fully automatic military assault rifles and machine pistols.   Gun control opponents in Congress and members of the NationalRifle Association have strongly urged against a semiautomatic banbecause it might be used by gun opponents to push for stifferrestrictions on all types of guns.   The gun ban was initially imposed in mid-March while thegovernment reviewed the uses of the weapons, and is part of ananti-crime package Bush will unveil in a speech Monday.   Bush has not approved the final package. But it is expected toinclude more money for prisons, stiffer sentencing requirements forcriminals who use guns, and more money for law enforcement ingeneral, including additional agents for the Bureau of AlcoholTobacco and Firearms, said the officials, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   When Bush ordered the initial ban, he also asked BATF to studythe suitability of the weapons for sporting purposes.   Current law requires that such weapons can only be brought intothe country if they are to be used for sport. The Bushadministration initiated the suspension when public outcry mountedagainst street crimes in which such weapons were used.   The guns were increasingly used in drug-related shootings andafter the Jan. 17 killing of five youngsters at a Stockton, Calif.,by a man who used a semiautomatic.   Several administration officials want Bush to extend the ban onimports to cover domestically manufactured weapons that are verysimilar to the foreign models.   But the president's plan, in its preliminary stages, did notinclude such a measure, the officials said. It was unclear how hewould deal with the suitability-for-sports question in deciding onthat aspect.   BATF is conducting a survey to determine the sports adaptabilityof the weapons. The agency has sent out questionnaires to hundredsof organizations, state fish and wildlife commissions, shootingclubs, gun owners and dealers to learn whether the semiautomaticsare being used for hunting purposes.   The agency's report to Bush, dealing with the uses of suchweapons as well as recommendations from a political standpoint, isnot expected to be complete before mid-June.   However, sources said Bush will deal with the issue beforeobtaining that review, since he will be disclosing other componentsof his crime package.   The review will deal with the sticky problem of determiningwhich of the weapons, some of which are distinguished only by theirappearance and trappings but not their firepower, are for sporting.   Bush is expected to announce his plan Monday in a Washingtonspeech to the National Fraternal Order of Police.   Among the provisions he is expected to approve are an increasein the mandatory federal sentence for crimes involving use of agun, and stiffer penalties for crimes involving assault-styleweapons.   Bush promised during his campaign last year to back toughersentencing and also called for doubling of the federal prisonbudget over four years, adding $250 million each year.   He also called for conversion of unneeded military bases intostate and federal prisons, and said money captured from drugdealers and racketeers should be used to pay for the prisons.</TEXT></DOC>
