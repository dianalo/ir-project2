And there's its medium-of-the future face, with visions ofcyberpunk, enhanced communication, virtual-reality identities and a host ofsocial implications.andP;  Virtual reality is a publishing medium for directexperiences.andP;  Who needs Bali when you have virtual reality?andM;The first market is more immediate and more immediately useful.andP;  Some of thehype is misleading; for example,  For once, reality has competition.&quot; Infact, before electronics there were books, lies, movies and dreams.andP;  Now,reality has one more variety of competition.andP;  And yes, it will undoubtedlychange the way we think about things.andP;  Clocks have made us think differently,as have automobiles (see  The Culture of Time and Space: 1880-1918,11 byStephen Kern, Harvard University Press, 1983).andP;  The real impact of virtualreality in the long run will be no less profound, on our assumptions as wellas our technical capabilities.andP;  In this issue we discuss first the immediatebusiness implications, and then wander off into more speculative realms specifically, both the values and shortcomings of virtual reality's abilityto offer direct &quot;experience&quot; and its lack of symbolic content.andP;  Can it should it?andP;  - stay all show and no tell?andM;Virtual reality, or virtual experience?andM;But first of all, let's examine what virtual reality is.andP;  The term obscuresrather than provokes clear thinking.andP;  Virtual reality is about as broad aconcept as artificial intelligence, and comes in as wide a range ofimplementations.andP;  In the most popular form, rather than look at a screen, youput on headgear and gloves to be immersed in a computer-created 3D simulationof reality  - or in a model that exists only in a designer's mind.andP;  You sit&quot;inside&quot; the screen (actually, behind displays in front of each eye), so thatthe computer simulation surrounds you.andP;  But depending on whose marketing youhear, VR or a broader term, artificial reality, can also mean using hologramsfor models and cameras to pick up user movements without the encumbrance ofspecial clothing.andP;  In the end, these are implementation details, althoughthey dramatically affect the quality of the experience.andP;  For now, mostcommercial systems involve clothing and goggles.andM;Two kinds of transducers (behavior and sensory) convert data from the modelworld to the user's world and back again.andP;  The system picks up the user'sbehavior  - gestures, movements of the head or body, possibly voice commands- and translates it for the virtual world.andP;  Software running on a powerfulreal-time computer computes changes in the model in response to the user'smovements and gestures.andP;  The model world contains objects that haveprogrammed behavior; they react to each other, to programmed  forces&quot; such asgravity, and to the user's movements.andP;  This behavior generates changes in theimages, sounds and other sensory signals the system sends back to the user.andO;The changes can be simple movement of the entire scene, with perspectivechanging appropriately, or rotation or movement or other behavior byindividual objects that the user touches.&quot; All this involves enormous amountsof computation as light angles, surfaces, and other factors must berecomputed in real-time.andP;  Rendering (textures and other realism) adds to thecomputational load, and is pretty crude so far.andM;The people who study what you are actually able to perceive through each ofyour sense organs discover extraordinary limitations.andP;  Yet you have thesensation of perceiving a whole lot in a continuous way.andP;  In virtual realitywe put &quot;clothing&quot; over the sense organs and replace the sensory perceptionsthat normally come from physical objects with ones from simulated objects.andO;Once you reach a certain threshold where your nervous system treats thesynthetic objects as  reality,&quot; all of a sudden your body and mind do all thework and make it look good.andP;  The human body is our secret ally; it lets usget away with weak technology.andP;  The best we can do right now is still very,very simple compared to what we want.andM;Underlying all this is the idea that the computer can send signals to oursenses to replace those sent by real objects.andP;  The interface never was thescreen; it was in our heads all along.andP;  In other words, we don't really &quot;see&quot;reality; we receive light waves on our retinas, sound waves in our ears, andnerve impulses relayed from our skin and muscles, chemicals in our noses andmouths, and interpret those as  reality.&quot; Some of those signalsandM;-- basically, sound waves and light waves  - can be created by computers, andgive us the same sensations that  natural&quot; signals do.andP;  Computer engineerswork meticulously to create mock-ups of actuality to send precisely the rightsignals.andP;  These mock-ups are more than just images on a screen; they'rethree-dimensional models whose images get computed in real-time as theyoperate according to their programmed behavior and as you movell them oryourself by turning your head or moving your hand or body.andP;  Usually themodels are a set of engineering descriptions plus programmed behavior; thecomputer power is necessary to transform that into the proper light signalsfor any given simulated location and angle the user might assume.andM;The effects are startling: You can sit inside a fictitious car to see whetherthe dashboard is at the proper height, fly over or through fields ofcomplicated piping with leaks shown in red, or do repair work remotely whilea robot does the real repairs in some dangerous or inaccessible location.andM;You can go beyond simulations of  reality&quot; to other effects ...andP;  call themvirtuality.andP;  In short, as with other capabilities, first we use them to mimica familiar technology (horseless carriage, wireless radio, &quot;screenplays&quot;) andthen eventually we discover what they can do uniquely well.andP;  What makes VRexciting is precisely that it's different from reality  - much as artificialintelligence is different from intelligence.andP;  VR lets you go beyond realityand fool around with dimensions and perception.andP;  You can watch somethinghappen very slowly that normally happens quickly, or vice versa  - a carcrash, for example, or the growth of a tumor.andP;  You can watch things big orsmall  - for example, the reaction of two molecules or the construction of abuilding.andP;  You can perceive things you couldn't normally perceive, with Xrayvision to look inside a patient's body, say, or infrared vision to see heatleaks in a power plant.andP;  Finally, you can go back back from virtual to real,and manipulate tools remotely in other wise inaccessible spaces.andM;Virtual reality offers four basic effects, although you could define others,and many applications involve combinations of these capabilities:andM;(1) simulation of reality, so you can experience something before it's fixedin tangible implementation, possibly vastly smaller or larger, faster orslower or more distant than reality (you can fit protein molecules togetherto make designer drugs, or design and test things --buildings, cars,hydraulic piping - without worrying about dimensions or the dangers of pokingaround inside a nuclear plant);andM;(2) signal conversion, so you can experience something real but not normallydetectable by your senses, as in leak detection (invisible chemicals madevisible, so that carbon monoxide looks like a dirty cloud), or for stressanalysis (the wing looks red where the joints are straining) or seismicanalysis, so you can &quot;move&quot; through virtual solid earth looking for oil or(computer-generated) glows that show the presence of seismic tensions thatcould lead to earthquakes;andM;(3) remote manipulation (or telerobotics or telepresence), where you canmanipulate virtual objects that in turn manipulate the real thing  - amicroscopic medical instrument, a space ship docking mechanism, an undersearobot, or a tool in a radioactive area  - while you're sitting safely on theground in human scale; andandM;(4) annotation, where you can &quot;label&quot; reality, so as to highlight the organsfor a medical student, or a broken widget for a repair person.andM;The process is the mediumandM;What makes this better than just watching a simulation on a screen? For one,you're inside the world, with the ability to turn around in 3D as the worldrecomputes itself around you.andP;  Second, you have the ability to go in andmanipulate it  - directly, by moving your hand, grasping objects ormanipulating virtual tools.andP;  There are routine tools for painting, cuttingand so forth, but also tools for copying (try that in the real world, withcoins for example), shrinking or enlarging, stretching or otherwise &quot;editing&quot;the virtual world.andP;  Sure, you could probably do some of this with a mouse,but the difference in feel is akin to what the mouse did for designers whenit replaced the keyboard.andM;Practical applications abound, as listed above, in design and modeling, andin reaching large, small, inaccessible or dangerous environments such ashuman bodies, protein molecules, space, underseas and power plants.andP;  Otherapplications include industrial training, and &quot;client presentations&quot; in theform of visualization of items such as housing and furniture, as well asaircraft, real-estate developments and other large projects.andP;  VR would alsobe wonderful for education, but it will probably reach children as gamesrather than as education, just as current computer technology does.andP;  Medicinelooks promising, but it generally requires higher resolution than is widelyavailable at present and will probably get entangled in regulation.andM;Both AI and VR benefit from reproducibility and consistency.andP;  With AI, thesame profile of credit risk gets the same rating each time; the system alwaysturns off the valves when certain dangerous conditions are reached.andP;  VRoffers similar benefits: Everyone in the company is working with the samemodel; the model you feel is the model I feel.andP;  A car manufacturer, forexample, no longer has to rely on clay models, but can simply ship a computerfile to its various design centers around the world and keep the variousiterations of it in an electronic archive.andP;  Better yet, Alice in Germany canwalk through her work with Juan in Detroit in real-time  with a good enoughphone line).andP;  But none of these changes need be permanent; you can store anyintermediate model as a computer file.andM;Virtual reality has the potential to change the world for designers much asspreadsheets did for financial planners.andP;  It's not so much that you canproduce new  results&quot; with the software, but that the software makes it somuch easier and more interactive to do so.andP;  The outcome is that more peopleget into the act, products are designed and redesigned more quickly, andquality improves more rapidly.andP;  It's less trouble to fix things.andP;  Butbuilding these models and programming their behavior is tough  - and untilit's easier virtual reality can't take off.andM;Every time we look at VR, we discover that we are looking at ourselves, notat a digital input stream or the needs of symbol processing ...andP;  Our body isour interface; the interface is not out there in the screen ...andP;  Realism isnot at all necessary; people will bring to the experience any amount ofcognitive flexibility ...andP;  Perhaps psychology is the physics of VR.andM;The marketandM;Overall, virtual reality will probably save money and provide opportunitiesfor its users  - designers, engineers, and other people who work with modelsand simulations  - before it makes significant money for most tool vendors.andO;The biggest market will probably be  &quot;clip-worlds&quot; from companies that don'tyet exist.andP;  Meanwhile, current players include Autodesk and privately ownedVPL Research, co-founded by VR wizard Jaron Lanier.andP;  Indirectly, DEC andSilicon Graphics will be prime beneficiaries through the use of theirhardware.andP;  Loosely defined, the market is worth about $20 million this year.andM;Virtual reality encompasses such an eclectic range of capabilities that theconsumer and business markets will be quite independent.andP;  Mattel has soldmore than 850,000 VR-inspired Power Gloves (with technology licensed fromVPL, below) for use with Nintendo sets, but they have been no more thanjoystick replacements until the arrival this fall of Super Glove Ball (a gamethat lets users operate a simulated hand on the screen).andP;  It will probablytake years before VR becomes a mass-market phenomenon  - consumers sharingvirtual environments or creating virtual identities  - that will generatesizable revenues and have any social impact.andP;  That is probably inevitableeventually, but we believe home fax is likely to sweep the nation first.andO;Virtual reality is something you have to do, whereas fax is something you ownand use when you need it.andP;  (Proponents say you get to participate; the restof us acknowledge that people are lazy and generally prefer to watch.andP;  Whatdo you call a virtual-reality couch potato?)andM;It's not about experiences so much as about shared experiences.andP;  It's not thetelevision; it's the telephone.andM;- John Perry BarlowandM;Who sells it?andM;Virtual reality is too broad an idea to be defined by a single company,product or approach.andP;  Standard hardware vendors such as DEC and SiliconGraphics stand to see sales of their regular equipment expand as it's used tosupport virtual reality with software purchased elsewhere, and DEC also hasits own project in the area, which it calls presence technology (a goodreminder that this field is as broad and variegated as AI).andP;  Vendors ofmodeling software may tailor their tools or provide add-ons or foundationsspecifically for virtual reality, as Autodesk is doing, or may simply helppeople create models that can be used with VR systems.andM;In the VR-specific end, there's a need both for sensory transducers andbehavior transducers, which operate symmetrically.andP;  Sensory transducers takephysical input and turn it into digital commands and messages for thedigital, virtual world; behavior transducers take the virtual behaviorgenerated by each object (in response to those messages and in accordancewith its own programmed behavior) and turn it back into sensory output orsignals (image and voice and force in touch-feedback devices) for the user toreceive.andP;  The sensory transducers generally use sensors in the user'sclothing or an image processor that might watch the movements of a head orhand; they also have digital-signal-processing units (not in the devicesthemselves, but in attached black boxes).andP;  The virtual world and its objectssit in the middle, interacting with the inputs according to the methodsprogrammed into or inherited by each object (computed on DEC or SiliconGraphics hardware).andP;  &quot;Environmental&quot; things such as walls or sky are alsoobjects in this context.andM;The virtual operating environments in development at a number of sites allmanage the interaction of these modules and their component objects, much asUNIX or OS/2, say, manage applications and their communications with variousinput and output devices.andP;  What's different is that most applications don'tinteract with each other as vigorously as the objects in a virtual world do,and there's generally less real-time data floating around.andP;  The principle isthe same, but there's a lot more coordination required, and ultimately greatopportunities for parallelism.andM;This is by no means a complete survey, and leaves out many pioneers in thefield, from Ivan Sutherland and Myron Krueger on.andP;  Currently, DigitalEquipment has a VR/telepresence research project, focusing on userparticipation in developing prototypes, and the ultimate use of VRenvironments for participatory design.andP;  The University of North California atChapel Hill is working on a variety of projects including medical, molecularmodeling and telerobotics applications spearheaded by Warren Robinett, aco-founder of the Learning Company creator of head-mounted display softwarefor NASA.andM;VPL Research: Virtual reality is our only businessandM;VPL Research, a leader in the field and the most active vendor, sellstransducer hardware and some related software in a set of modules that costabout $50,000 in total.andP;  The hardware includes the EyePhone and AudioSphere(a headset through which you &quot;sell and  hear&quot; virtual reality), and DataGlove(which uses optical fiber to sense your gestures).andP;  The software, RealityBuilt for 2, includes RB2 Swivel, a tool for building mechanical models(licensed to Paracomp and very successful as Swivel 3D), and Body Electric,for defining the behavior of the world and its objects.andP;  The software toolsrun on Macs; they generate &quot;behavior transducer&quot; software to run on SiliconGraphics or DEC machines, which run another $100,000 or so.andM;Flex, Body Electric's incrementally compiled visual programming language,approaches the programmability we espouse.andP;  It uses boxes and arrows toindicate input-output flows and event sequences, and it can not only describeobject features but also specify object behavior, such as &quot;move left if youhit a green wall and right if you hit a red wall,&quot; or &quot;insert yourself intothe nearest matching hole.&quot; (The boxes themselves include text.) BodyElectric also includes a lot of defaults that the user may accept or modifywith Flex, such rules about gravity, distance and solidity of objects.andP;  Itsmajor flaw: It works in real-time, but not in virtual reality; a programmersitting at a console can alter the behavior of a VR object while it's inaction, but the user can't do it from within virtual reality.andP;  VPL is workingon such a within-VR language, code-named Embrace.andM;Look at a two-year-old.andP;  We're talking about waving your arms, pointing,single word gestures, at least single-word commands, toddling around; that'sthe kind of behavior that ought to be running computer systems.andP;  At thesoftware level, we're trying to develop inclusive computation, something thatsurrounds you.andP;  The idea is software that simulates environments rather thanwindows on environments.andP;  -  William BrickenandM;VPL was co-founded in 1985 by Mr. Outside Jaron Lanier and Mr. InsideJeanJacques Grimaud.andP;  (VPL initially stood for Visual Programming Language;now it's Virtual Programming Language.) Ceo Lanier was formerly a free-lancevideo-game designer and also did work with Atari; president Grimaud hadearlier founded Micro-Archi, a before-its-time palmtop computer vendor.andO;Funding vas bootstrap mostly, with royalties from Lanier's Moondust videogame and a little private money from friends such as MIT's Marvin Minsky, anda later infusion from the French electronics company Thomson CSF.andM;VPL already has 500 customers, including Pacific Bell, several NASA locationsand companies in such areas as auto and aircraft design, medicine, and evenconsumer marketing.andP;  NASA Marshall has ordered VPL equipment to replace bigphysical models of a space station.andP;  Matsushita is planning a simulatedkitchen to market its appliances: Consumers can bring their own floor layoutto a virtual reality showroom and select and position virtual appliances intheir virtual kitchens before buying.andP;  Overall, VPL has sold somewherebetween 50 and 100 full systems, with the remaining customers buying just acomponent or two for research or pilot projects.andM;VPL is sticking to the high end of the market, and in fact is alreadyprofitable by dint of sticking to its knitting and not going too early aftera broader market.andP;  It's addressing that market in a joint effort withLogitech to develop a low-priced DataGlove for use with screens, and with itslicense to Mattel for the Power Glove.) The company has about 35 people,including two sales engineers.andP;  Most of its larger customers are technicallycapable themselves, and have a fairly close relationship with VPL's non-salesengineers.andP;  As a company we're after markets where there's a need and wherewe can provide something others can't,&quot; says Grimaud.andP;  It's a first-personexperience.andP;  We're not trying to replace existing Alias [rendering] systems,but more provide the experience of being in the driver's seat.&quot;andM;The major competition, he says, is the old way of doing things.andP;  An aerospacefirm, for example, is using VR to do prototype airplanes, replacing somephysical models and current visualization software on workstations, forsimulations to study human interaction in the cockpit and how best to carryout certain maintenance procedures.andM;Autodesk: VR is another arrow in our quiverandM;Also active in the market is Autodesk, which already has the world's largest(in units, not dollars) installed base of computer-aided design software,with half a million users, and a habit of openness to third-party add-in andadd-on tools.andP;  It hopes to have a VR environment out next year.andP;  Its virtualreality team has gone through some turmoil over the last year as the companyfocused on more immediate commercial efforts (cf.andP;  the experience of itsAmerican Information Exchange subsidiary, Release 1.0, 90-7).andP;  WilliamBricken (below) and a number of other researchers have left, but theCyberspace project continues with eight people, led by Randy Walser, whoworked on telerobotics and AI at Advanced Decision Systems and on video gamesat Bally/ Midway before joining Autodesk in 1988.andP;  As in Autodesk's basicAutoCAD business, says Walser, We're trying to reach developers now, and getVR tools into their hands.andP;  We're building a broad-based distributedsimulation system that's open but ties in intimately with AutoCAD.&quot;andM;The whole thrust is to make abstract things more tangible.andP;  Long run, thebusiness is the worlds or the models, the content [-- which will be built byAutodesk users and developers].andM;- Randy WalserandM;The system is called Trix, a word that has a flavor of UNIX to it, and alsosomething of  tricks human senses.&quot; At Trix's core is a world-simulator thatmanages the virtual world created by a developer.andP;  It maintains a list of thevirtual objects and their runtime addresses, and knows at what point to giveover control.andP;  It is written in C++, and object-oriented, constructed soanyone can plug in anything, in any language, either in advance or atruntime.andP;  Thus the objects it manages can be written in any language  - orwith almost any design tool, not just AutoCAD.andP;  It also manages messages fromthe  user object,&quot; and manages and translates (transduces) return messagesfrom the objects to the display and other output systems.andM;Trix is designed to let developers to create virtual worlds with virtualobjects independent of input and output devices (call it Windows for virtualobjects).andP;  Users can buy their own preferred variety and power of suchdevices, as long as they follow minimum Autodesk conventions.andP;  As the mostmass-market CAD vendor, Autodesk well understands the value of openness, andis willing to sacrifice proprietary special effects for generality and aninterface that is easy to talk to.andP;  The system runs now on 386es and 486eswith DOS, and will also come out in Mac and SPARC versions.andM;Human Interface Technology Lab: Let's win the VR race !andP;  Autodesk's loss ofWilliam Bricken was the University of Washington's gain.andP;  Both sides agreethat he belongs at Washington's Human Interface Technology Lab, where he canpursue high-end research into the psychological and mathematical implicationsof virtual reality rather than build a market-driven product.andP;  As part of theresearch, he is running the development of the Virtual Environment OperatingShell, comparable to Autodesk's Trix but higher-end.andP;  It runs on workstationsand will eventually support parallelism, and is written in C and LISP.andO;Bricken is still in contact with Autodesk, and the two groups are workingtogether to ensure as much interoperability as possible.andP;  It's too early forstandards yet,&quot; says Bricken,  but we do need conventions for objectinterchange and input data formats.&quot;andM;We're also working on a headmount technology called a laser microscanner.andO;Rather than have a CRT or LCD generate an optical image in front of youreyes, the idea is to have a low-power laser project the image on your retina.andO;Instead of pixel addressing, we are talking about rods and cones addressing.andM;- William BrickenandM;HITL is run by Tom Furness, who earlier ran a &quot;super cockpit&quot; project for theAir Force.andP;  It has 10 staff members and 12 students, and has created theVirtual Worlds Consortium to attract funding and to raise the credibility ofvirtual reality in general.andP;  Members include Digital, Alias, VPL, US West,Sun and others soon at $50,000 per year.andP;  For that they get pre-releaseaccess to the lab's work and a way to extend their own research efforts.andM;However, a forthcoming meeting of a Japanese &quot;study commission&quot; sponsored byMITI (October 10) in Tokyo will probably do even more for the field, just asSputnik spurred our space program three decades ago.andP;  The study commissionmembers include Tokyo University, NTT, Toshiba, Mitsubishi, Sharp, Sanyo,Matsushita, Fuji-Xerox and Nintendo.andM;The glorious future: Clip-vorlds and power to the userandM;Eventually, software clip-worlds will outsell headgear and gloves.andP;  The realpotential of this technology lies in the power it will ultimately give tousers to design things  - real or simulated  - the same way drawing packageslet users build images with clip-art and (increasingly) graphics objectlibraries.andP;  Virtual reality is simply a feedback mechanism.andM;But users need more than just canned worlds.andP;  It's not just the ability tooperate within the 3D environment that's so important.andP;  In fact, in manycases you can get the same knowledge from looking at a screen, although theimpact is greater with VR.andP;  In other cases, such as operating equipmentremotely, the interactiveness of VR is key.andP;  But the real value of VR will bethe ability to create and program those environments from inside.andM;Skilled programmers can now create virtual-reality environments for designersand other industrial users (or wealthy consumers) to &quot;work in&quot; andmanipulate, but virtual reality is not immediately programmable by its users.andO;Although VR provides direct experience and direct manipulation capabilitiesto the users of its virtual worlds, it's a long way from giving them the samepowers as the builders of those worlds and the objects in them.andP;  You can movethings around directly and even modify them slightly within VR, but to tellthem how to move around when you aren't there to do it yourself (or how tointeract with each other and with other users), you have to go outside thesystem and use a tool such as VPL's Flex.andM;The currency of VR is organization, not possession  VR is illogicalpositivism: If you can specify it, it is meaningful.andP;  All empiricalhypotheses are true.andM;--William BrickenandM;The essence of programming is using symbols and variables and rules so youcan manipulate whole groups and classes of things, while direct manipulationallows you to move one thing (or group) at a time, interactively.andP;  Lanier'sgoal is to combine both, by bringing the capabilities Flex and beyond intovirtual reality.andP;  People will end up discovering the limitations of VR muchas people discovered the limits of direct manipulation with page-layoutprograms - it's nice to move things around on the page, but do you have to doevery page? You want new chapters to start on new pages, and figures torenumber themselves automatically when they're moved.andP;  Likewise, in a virtualworld, you don't want to have to put tops on all the houses; you want them toslide into place automatically, each sized to fit the house it covers.andM;VR as social phenomenon: The experience is the messageandM;So what about the second vision? While businesspeople (and the DefenseDepartment) are happily exploring the potential of virtual reality for useful&quot; tasks, artists, sociologists and entertainment types are exploringits use as the communication medium of the future.andP;  Yes, this isn't justanother form of television.andP;  You don't sit there and watch; you jump in andget involved.andP;  The point isn't the individual's experience but rather thetransferability of the experience, which can be shared across space or time.andO;The goal is not to communicate with the computer but through it.andM;Still, people are only half-right when they say, &quot;VR is not television; it'sthe telephone.&quot; It's not the telephone either.andP;  It's a medium of expressionmore than of communication, like music or art.andP;  After all, most of whatpeople communicate about concerns not just physical things  - things that canbe adequately represented by the five senses (let alone just two or three ofthem) - but people, ideas, feelings, events, which operate within socialstructures, not in physical space.andP;  How do you simulate a promotion, the longwait you had at the post office (please don't make us live through thatagain!), your desire to have dinner with someone?andM;Now that we can represent reality directly, why use symbols?andM;In the end, reality is more than physical presence.andP;  It's the rules andcontexts that govern things  - rules of human behavior, human memories, etc.andO;Take a cat.andP;  The representation of the cat may be exact, but the meaning, theresonance, the implications of the cat are not inherent in its physicalrepresentation.andP;  Even if you could in fact reproduce the cat, most of itsmeaning lies in its history, not in its physical presence.andP;  Otherwise, wewouldn't spend lifetimes and millions trying to analyze dreams.andM;Please, if there is anybody here from the press, this is not electronic LSD.andO;As somebody from Autodesk said recently, it's going to be a long time beforeit approaches the price/performance ratio of LSD.andP;  But it is a real good toolfor getting people who might be a little Newtonian and deterministic torecognize that reality is an opinion and not a fact.andP;  [Lack of thisunderstanding] is the seat of intolerance.andP;  If my reality is the reality, Ican do anything I want in the service of that reality...andM;I want to distinguish cyberspace from virtual reality...andP;  [Cyberspace]actually exists now.andP;  Cyberspace is where all kinds of electronicinformational transactions take place.andP;  Cyberspace is the place where you gowhen you talk to the phone.andP;  Cyberspace is where the money is ...andP;  Much ofcommerce in society at this time takes place in ...andP;  cyberspace.andP;  It's afrontier kind of place.andP;  It takes a lot to maneuver around in it ...andP;  Theanswer to the alienation [of cyberspace] and data shock is to a large extentbeing able to inhabit cyberspace as a place, being able to go in there and besomebody.andM;- John Perry BarlowandM;If one uses a word such as house, it may be fairly neutral, but the momentyou display or virtualize a particular house, with French windows, say, or anEichler, a hovel or a mansion, it evokes reactions.andP;  It symbolizes somethingto the other party, whether you meant to or not.andP;  Suppose the generic personAlice creates reminds Juan of his mother? Virtual reality makes you be morespecific than you may want to be.andP;  With symbols, you can represent only theattributes that you intend  - and even then your receiver may misperceiveyour meaning because of his own associations.andM;The problem with VR is that it creates the illusion of completecommunication.andP;  With words, we know there's ambiguity, incompleteness,misunderstandings.andP;  With virtual reality, we're less aware (as yet) of thelack of abstract representation  - analogy, generalization, rules,specifications.andM;So, yes, there will be a consumer market for virtual reality, but in theshort run it will be closer to the market for musical instruments orprerecorded cassettes than the market for telephone service.andP;  Long-run,people may build their own virtual-reality manifestations, and there may be ahuge business in virtual-reality parlors, virtual-reality models,virtual-reality modeling tools, and so forth.andP;  But whatever anyone tells you,virtual reality is only a set of capabilities for modeling one aspect ofreality  - the physical part.andP;  Like artificial intelligence, it has its own,powerful capabilities and unique functions, and will be useful not only initself, but in extending the way we think about reality, symbols and physicalmanifestations much as AI has extended our thinking about problem-solving,cognition, language  - and even about thinking.andP;  But in no way is eitherartificial intelligence or virtual reality a replacement for the real thing.andM;Whenever I want you, all I have to do is dream ...andP;  Only trouble is, geewhiz, I'm dreaming my life away.andM;- Everly BrothersandM;Juan andamp; Alice in virtual reality: Some intriguing social questionsandM;While we don't think virtual reality will replace physical closeness  - andfor most business meetings a teleconference is good enough  - the notion ofvirtual selves has interesting implications even beyond such socialaddictions as to video games, chess or any other medium for escapism.andP;  Longago, one's appearance was more or less a physical fact of nature; nowadays,it indicates social and financial status.andP;  First it was cosmetics, thencosmetic surgery.andP;  In the future, it may be one's virtual self.andP;  Here aresome imaginary snippets of conversation, circa 2084:andM;&quot;Jaron looks awfully scruffy these days.andP;  Can't he afford a good designer?&quot;andM;&quot;But Mom, all the other kids are doing it.andP;  How come I'm the only one whocan't have a virtual self with holes in the wings? It's just not fair!&quot;andM;&quot;Mitsukoshi-Marcus is having a special on designer selves by famouspostSymbolic artists.andP;  Visit our virtual studio today by picturephone or...&quot;andM;In September:  Christmas starts earlier and earlier! Everyone's red and greenalready!&quot;andM;&quot;I'm sorry, sir, he's in another world with an important client right now.andO;Can I have him get back to you?&quot;andM;&quot;Like, she instantiated a totally awful self at that conference!
