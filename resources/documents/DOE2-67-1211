Data evaluated from phosphatic condensed beds withinthe Aptian-Albian Garschella Formation (Austria) and comparative studiesof similar beds within the Miocene Monterey Formation and the PlioceneSisquoc and Purisima Formations (California) suggest constraints on theevolution of &quot;phosphate maximum zones.&quot; The presence of low accumulationrates and optimal biochemical conditions within the upper boundary zoneof the oxygen minimum zone may result in sufficient influx and biochemicalconcentration of phosphate, calcium, and fluorine in pore waters of theuppermost sediment layer and, subsequently, in phosphogenesis.</TEXT></DOC>
