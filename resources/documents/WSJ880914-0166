Now it's every few days.    The latest is the rumor in Tokyo diplomatic circles that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev is about to make a major speech on Asian policy, perhaps equal in importance to his July 1986 Vladivostok address that contained overtures for a broad improvement in relations with China and the rest of Asia. Mr. Gorbachev is currently on a weeklong trip to Siberia.    Other signs in recent days include speculation in the Japanese press about high-level visits, and even about a possible softening of Moscow's attitude in its dispute with Tokyo over four Japanese islands seized by Soviet forces in the closing days of World War II. Japanese demands for the return of the islands, known as the Northern Territories, have been the major sticking point between the two countries for the last several decades.    &quot;There's a momentum building,&quot; says a Japanese Foreign Ministry official. &quot;We have a road to a political dialogue.&quot;    In Washington, many analysts agree Mr. Gorbachev wants to improve relations with Japan as part of a major diplomatic offensive that includes China and South Korea. But they predict the road will be bumpy, in part because they are convinced Moscow wants to patch up ties with China first. Paul Kreisberg, an expert on Northeast Asian issues at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, says Mr. Gorbachev probably is reluctant to push the Soviet military to abandon the four islands or to reverse its buildup of naval and air power in the Pacific.    Many specialists in Tokyo are also skeptical of the latest straws in the wind. &quot;You can't expect relations to change quickly,&quot; says a member of the Japanese parliament who follows foreign affairs.    But Mr. Kreisberg and other U.S. experts think the Soviets could win friends in Japan by pulling back some of the troops and aircraft they have deployed in the Northern Territories, or else by returning two of the islands, as they promised to do in 1956, and agreeing to discuss the status of the other two when tensions are lower. &quot;They're going to do some things and they can score some points,&quot; says Alan Romberg of the Council on Foreign Relations.    The recent feelers from Moscow include self-criticism reminiscent of that which preceded other major policy changes, such as the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. And both Moscow and Tokyo have reasons to want warmer ties.    The Soviets have dreamed for years of developing their vast eastern regions, but they lack the money and know-how. The Japanese have both in abundance. The Soviets are also eager to expand their political influence in Northeast Asia.    It would also be in their interest to weaken Japan's military alliance with the U.S., or slow the buildup of Tokyo's military. Closer ties mightn't accomplish those aims, but continued frost can't help.    On Japan's side, closer connections would offer Japanese companies new markets. Tokyo might also relish the attentions of another superpower for reasons of status. &quot;We've got to put stability into the relationship,&quot; says the Japanese Foreign Ministry official.    In one sign of progress in relations, preparations are reportedly being made for a visit to Tokyo this year by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.    In his Vladivostok speech, Mr. Gorbachev called for exchanges of high-level official visits between the Soviet Union and Japan, but none has taken place since. Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone visited Moscow in July, but he had no official mandate. For much of the latter half of 1986 the Soviets hinted that Mr. Gorbachev would come to Tokyo. But then the Toshiba affair -- in which a subsidiary of Toshiba Corp. illegally supplied sophisticated machine tools to the Soviets -- intervened, and Japanese-Soviet relations iced over again. Last year, the two countries took turns expelling some of the other's nationals as alleged spies.    Now the Soviets are making overtures again. When Mr. Nakasone returned from his talks in Moscow, it was to report the Soviet leader's view that the Soviets must &quot;think of something, somehow&quot; regarding the Northern Territories. Later, a Japanese press account reported on a Soviet magazine article in which top Asia policy makers supposedly recognized that the Soviet Union must eventually agree to discuss the &quot;four islands&quot; question if it hopes to improve relations with Japan.    So far, the Japanese have made little attempt to hide their view that the Soviets need them more than they need the Soviets. Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita raised the Northern Territories issue during a European tour and at the Toronto summit in June, provoking sharp criticism from the official Soviet media. When Soviet diplomats visit the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Soviet Union division these days, the first thing they see is a poster demanding the return of the islands.    Whether the Soviets are willing to go that far may depend on how eager they are to develop Siberia. Skeptics question whether Mr. Gorbachev has the time, money and manpower for such a vast undertaking. &quot;Everything there is primitive beyond belief,&quot; says a Western diplomat.    Other reasons for skepticism include the priority Japan still puts on its relationship with the U.S. and its historical wariness of its giant neighbor to the northwest. In addition, some question how enthusiastic big Japanese companies are about participating in the development of Siberia.    Says Mr. Romberg of the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington: &quot;I think if you look back five or 10 years from now, you'll see a lot more Soviet involvement in Asia. But I don't think the Soviets will be able to supplant the United States, either economically or politically.&quot; But Mr. Romberg and other analysts agree that with Mr. Gorbachev on the offensive and trade differences continuing to bedevil U.S.-Japanese relations, the U.S. needs to pay more attention to a region in which it long has taken U.S. pre-eminence for granted.    ---   John Walcott in Washington contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
