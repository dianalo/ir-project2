Their unease has produced everything from a forgivable slip ofthe tongue in a prime minister to a jaw-lowering newspapereditorial expressing grief over Emperor Hirohito's death.   With the many social changes in the 62 years of Hirohito'sreign, the Japanese just don't seem to know how to deal properlywith his illness _ much less his eventual death.   The Asahi Shimbun, Japan's second-largest newspaper, said NissanMotor Corp. had canceled a television commercial with the catchphrase ``Is everybody in good spirits?'' while a Tokyo cardealership had taken down posters extolling ``The Joy of Living.''   For high-ranking politicians, overseas sojourns have beencanceled or postponed and even trips away from Tokyo have beenavoided.   Television stations have toned down boisterous programming,marriage ceremonies have been put off and sales put on hold atdepartment stores.   However, Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi told reporters todaythat the emperor would be disappointed at a rash of cancellationsof sports events and autumn festivals.   ``I think the people's consideration for the emperor's earlyrecovery is so precious,'' Obuchi said. ``But it's not favorable ifit has a negative effect on social and economic activities. Itwould disappoint the emperor, who always considers the people.''   The 87-year-old emperor took to bed Sept. 19 after he vomitedblood from intestinal hemorrhaging.   At first, domestic news media confined themselves mainly toreporting the details of his medical condition. However, reportshave now begun to percolate through the taut silence that theemperor, the longest-reigning monarch alive, may have cancer _itself a taboo subject in Japan.   News organizations have tried to walk a tightrope, demonstratingproper deference to the ailing monarch but saying enough to showtheir concern.   Even leaders schooled in public life have faltered in theconfusion.   During a meeting with reporters following his first trip to theImperial Palace since the emperor fell ill, Prime Minister NoboruTakeshita was clearly unnerved, one news report said.   In response to a reporter's question, Takeshita committed thesocial gaffe of using honorifics in reference to himself, theweekly Shukan Asahi magazine reported.   Honorifics, part of the Japanese vocabulary used when speakingor referring to people of higher status, have been prominent innewspaper headlines describing the emperor's condition.   Though forgivable, the breach of etiquette underscoredTakeshita's _ and the nation's _ discomfort over the emperor'scondition.   On Monday, the English-language Mainichi Daily News accidentallypublished an editorial expressing grief over the emperor's death.The scandalous mistake ended in dismissal of the paper's generalmanager and demotion of the editor in chief of the whole Mainichigroup of publications.   Some embarrassments have been avoided. In keeping with therestrained national mood, no alcohol was served at a fund-raisingparty Wednesday night for a junior member of parliament, themass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported today.   The Japanese have also toiled _ and puzzled _ over contingencyplans for the emperor's death. A news report even quoted a managerof one restaurant franchise as saying tiny Japanese flags used asdecorations for children's lunches would be removed.   ``They would be removed because they are flags that can't beflown at half-staff,'' the manager reportedly said.   A nationwide association of outdoor advertisers, includingbusinesses which produce or regulate the use of neon signs,recently held an emergency meeting to set guidelines, according tothe weekly magazine Aera.   They decided that when the emperor dies, all large neon signsshould be turned off until the fourth night afterward.   ``It would be terrible if only your shop would stand out,'' saidone industry source quoted by the nationally circulatednewsmagazine.   Not everyone, however, has fretted over doing the wrong thing.   The Akahata newspaper of the Japan Communist Party criticizedthe subdued national mood by publishing comments from readersangered by changes in television schedules.   ``I was really mad,'' a 27-year-old housewife was quoted astelling the newspaper. ``My 6- and 7-year-old children startedcrying in front of the TV set after waiting for a cartoon show tobegin.''</TEXT></DOC>
