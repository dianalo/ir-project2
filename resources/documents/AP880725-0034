The driver, who estimated he was traveling at 50 mph, was ableto walk away from Sunday's crash at Lakeside Speedway.   The car, which landed in an open space between the guard railsand the grandstands after tearing through a chain link fence,``looked like it had gone through a compactor,'' said Lakesidepolice Sgt. Bob Wall.   Those injured were sitting in the front row, said spectator MikeGarrison of Thornton.   Another race driver, Don Cash, said he was about five lengthsbehind the car driven by Gary Burton when Burton lost control.   ``He hit the wall and got airborne,'' said Cash. ``I lookedagain and it (the car) just went around like a helicopter.''   Burton, 22, got out and walked away after the crash, Cash said.   Burton was taken to a hospital shaken but uninjured, authoritiessaid.   Burton said the track was slick. ``The car got loose and taggedthe guardrail. I got a little too close to the guardrail,'' saidBurton.   Kristy Carlson, 26, of suburban Arvada, was pronounced dead atSt. Anthony Hospital late Sunday, said spokesman Randy Shook.   Twelve others were injured and taken to hospitals, but only a4-year-old girl with a broken arm and head injuries was admittedfor observation.
