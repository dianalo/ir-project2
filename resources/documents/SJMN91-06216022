They were earlier owners of rebellious limbs. They knew what anuisance a hand or an arm with a mind of its own could be. When they leastexpected it, said appendage could be counted upon to embarrass them or, worse,lunge for a convenient throat.;    Bill Chrushank, the criminal psychologisthero of &quot;Body Parts&quot; (now playing), has a similar problem. The victim of anespecially nasty rear-ender on the interstate, Chrushank (Jeff Fahey) awakesthe next day in the hospital to good news and bad. The bad is that he lost hisright arm in the crash. The good: The talented Dr. Webb (Lindsay Duncan) hassewn on a handy replacement.;    In some ways the new arm is better andstronger than the original, Chrushank discovers. So what if it strikes outviciously at times and, when in bed, is prone to wander about mischievously?Chrushank's wife isn't complaining. Nor is Chrushank. Until he beginsexperiencing bizarre nightmares (shot through a red filter and set to ominousmusic).;     If Chrushank were up on such classic horrors as &quot;The Hands ofOrlac&quot; and &quot;Mad Love,&quot; he would know his arm is compliments of a death-rowpsycho. The guy's name is (or was) Charles Fletcher. He was responsible for 20deaths. Little wonder the transplant operation is monitored by eight armedguards. Charlie is the kind of guy who's too mean to die.;     Directed byEric Red and loosely adapted from the '60s cult novel &quot;Choice Cuts,&quot; &quot;BodyParts&quot; is a well-executed, if familiar, thriller that benefits from earnestperformances by Fahey, Duncan, Kim Delaney (as Chrushank's increasinglyalarmed wife), and &quot;Child's Play&quot; regular Brad Dourif.;    Dourif plays a hackpainter who's suddenly found a tortured new style -- with the help ofFletcher's other transplanted arm. Peter Murnik, who resembles a young AnthonyPerkins, is the proud owner of Fletcher's lower half. South African actorZakes Mokae (&quot;A Rage in Harlem&quot;) appears as the Johnny-on-the-spot detectivetrying to keep tabs on the missing parts.;    This cast attacks the materialas if it were Chekhov. This adds to the brooding suspense but detracts fromthe satire. Scenes of Chrushank shaving himself (badly) and speeding down astreet while handcuffed to someone in another car have a Looney Tunes quality.Indeed, similar moments have already been played for knockabout farce by SamRaimi in his &quot;Evil Dead&quot; movies.;    Yes, there's more grisly humor here thanRed and company care to acknowledge. In one sense, this grim little chiller isthe ultimate reunion story. At least that's how Boileau and Narcejac handledthe source novel. Red borrowed the authors' premise (a full-body transplantgone awry), threw out their narrator-protagonist (a hilariously myopicgendarme), and kept their nifty denouement.;    Had Boileau-Narcejac's &quot;ChoiceCuts&quot; been adapted in the '60s, when heart transplants were a new thing, itmight have scored as outrageous black comedy. Arriving now, after thesimilarly plotted (and much funnier) &quot;Re-Animator&quot; and &quot;Frankenhooker,&quot; Red'sworkmanlike update strikes one as more quaint than bizarre, like a four-posterwith a spare post.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GLENN LOVELL, Mercury News Film Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910803  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  565  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday August 3, 199100216022,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
