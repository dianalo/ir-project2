Thus, unless the Latin American debt outlook worsens in the months ahead, it now seems unlikely that the New York banks will boost reserve levels anytime soon. Analysts had predicted that any bank wanting to add to reserves would do so in the fourth quarter, rather than cripple 1988 earnings.    With 1987 financial results already the worst for the major banks since the Great Depression, analysts reasoned, banks would have had little to lose by boosting reserves even more in the fourth quarter.    In reporting fourth-quarter earnings, J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. didn't make major boosts to reserves, following a pattern established by Chemical New York Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. last week. Citicorp's flashy showing -- a doubling of profit -- came largely on the strength of one-time gains.    Meanwhile, Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank Corp. and San Francisco-based Wells Fargo andamp; Co. made reserve increases, following Security Pacific Corp., Continental Illinois Corp., First Interstate Bancorp and First Chicago Corp., which previously announced them. Mellon and Los Angeles-based Security Pacific reported losses yesterday, but Wells posted strong profit gains despite the reserve addition.    Also reporting results yesterday was First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas, which had a fourth-quarter loss affected by the Southwest's economic problems.    In recent weeks, many U.S. banks with either small loan exposures or strong capital bases have boosted reserves to 50% or more of their loan exposure to five Latin American countries.    However, several New York banks, such as Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical, would be hard-pressed to match such reserve levels. Moreover, those, and others like Morgan and Citicorp, are searching for a solution to the debt crisis which avoids major loan write-offs that would reduce earnings.    Felice Gelman, a securities analyst with Fox-Pitt, Kelton Inc., said, &quot;There's no benefit to any of the New York banks that are undercapitalized. The first time that the banks added to reserves, stock market investors rewarded them for recognizing reality. How far can the banks dig into their equity to boost reserves?&quot;    In a statement, Citicorp said its current reserves are &quot;both adequate and appropriate&quot; in light of current negotiations with Brazil, progress in reducing the bank's exposure and Citicorp's future earnings.    One measure of the kind of year it was for banks is that even the industry's nonpareil, Morgan, had its worst year in decades. Still, it was the largest bank to post a profit for the year.    Citicorp   A $283 million gain on the sale of portions of its two Manhattan office buildings helped fuel the big rise in fourth-quarter earnings at the nation's largest banking concern.    Citicorp's loss for the year stemmed from a $3 billion addition in the second quarter to loss reserves for loans to developing countries. Excluding one-time gains and losses, Citicorp's 1987 profit would have been $1.15 billion. Excluded are gains on real estate in the fourth quarter and pension assets in the third quarter, plus the effect of the reserve addition.    Wall Street shrugged off yesterday's good news. Citicorp common stock fell 25 cents to close at $19.25 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Citicorp's individual, or consumer, bank earned $149 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $113 million a year earlier. The 32% increase reflects higher volume in credit cards, improved credit performance and a lower provision for losses.    The institutional, or corporate and international, bank reported earnings of $270 million for the quarter, up 36% from a year earlier. Revenue gains, lower expenses and lower write-offs combined to offset Brazil's suspension of interest payments.    The weakest performance was turned in by Citicorp's investment bank, which saw earnings drop 16% in the fourth quarter, to $82 million from $98 million. A $3 million loss in its trading account and only $6 million in gains on investment securities hurt the unit's performance. Foreign exchange gains of $156 million were 90% above the earlier figure.    Net interest income for the fourth quarter totaled $1.73 billion, up 4% from $1.66 billion a year earlier. Citicorp's net yield for the quarter, the difference between what it pays and earns on money, was 3.83%, down from 4.08% a year earlier. The fourth-quarter provision for loan losses was $213 million, down from $508 million.    Growth in operating expenses, which had been running 23% over the 1986 figures, slowed to 15% in the fourth quarter.    Chase Manhattan   Buoying 1987 fourth-quarter results was a $39 million after-tax gain on the sale of real estate in Japan. Chase also sold its Netherlands subsidiary in the fourth quarter, but the bank said the after-tax impact of the sale wasn't significant.    Offsetting factors included Brazil and Ecuador's continuing nonpayment on interest on loans. The lost interest reduced Chase's after-tax profit by $31 million for the fourth quarter and $126 million for the full year.    Net interest income for the quarter was $812 million, down 2% from $826 million. The net yield was 3.65%, down from 4.09% in 1986's fourth quarter. Chase reported non-interest income of $495 million, a 19% increase from $415 million a year earlier. Much of the increase in non-interest income came from foreign exchange trading (up $17 million, or 38%) and its trading account (up $14 million, or 72%). Gains on sales of investment securities plummeted 83% to $5 million from $30 million a year earlier.    The provision for credit losses was $130 million, down $10 million from a year earlier. Loan write-offs rose 4% to $128 million. Operating expenses rose 5% to $875 million.    Chase's loss for the year stemmed from its $1.6 billion increase to loan-loss reserves in the second quarter.    Chase's common stock fell 25 cents to close at $21.50 a share yesterday in Big Board composite trading.    J.P. Morgan   Net interest income dropped 7.8% in the fourth quarter to $477.1 million from $517.5 million a year earlier. Morgan's net yield narrowed to 2.57% in the fourth quarter from 3.01% a year earlier.    The $40.4 million decline in interest earnings was more than offset by a $155.8 million increase in non-interest income, particularly foreign exchange trading, and corporate trust fees and commissions. However, Morgan did incur losses in its U.S. government security trading. Non-interest income totaled $387.4 million, compared with $231.6 million a year earlier.    For the quarter, Morgan added $30 million to its loss reserves, compared with a $55 million provision a year earlier. Net write-offs in the quarter were $25 million, compared with $30 million in the same period of 1986.    The weak U.S. dollar, and higher expenditures on data processing and communications, contributed to a 23% rise in expenses, to $464.5 million from $376.7 million in the same quarter a year earlier.    Regarding the full-year results, Morgan's earnings drop reflected Brazil's suspension of interest payments on $1.3 billion of medium-term and long-term loans last February, and Morgan's $875 million addition to loan-loss reserves during the second quarter.    The problem Brazilian loans reduced earnings on an annual basis by $136 million. That sum includes a $19 million payment made by Brazil in December. Morgan said it is deferring recognition of this payment pending further negotiations with Brazil.    In Big Board composite trading yesterday, Morgan common stock fell 87.5 cents to close at $33.375 a share.    Security Pacific   Security Pacific's fourth-quarter loss resulted from a previously announced addition of $350 million to reserves against troubled foreign debt. Without the addition, the company said, earnings would have been $156.9 million, or $1.41 a share, up 26% from $124.3 million, or $1.15 a share.    But almost all of the increase in these &quot;core&quot; earnings came from a $27 million after-tax one-time gain on the sale of operations rendered redundant by the acquisition of Rainier Bancorp., Seattle, in the third quarter of 1987. Moreover, year-earlier profit was depressed by a $116.6 million increase in the loan-loss allowance.    Non-interest income increased 3% in the fourth quarter to $446.2 million. A $42.9 million increase in profit from international fees, including a $28.6 million gain in foreign exchange income, helped offset big declines in trading account profit and in gains on sale of equity and investment securities. The declines, totaling $70.2 million, resulted mainly from the Oct. 19 market crash and the lack of a recovery in market prices since then.    For the year, &quot;core earnings&quot; would have totaled $518.3 million, or a 0.71% return on assets, without the special reserves for foreign debt, the company said. Such earnings are up 14% from 1986 earnings with a 0.72% return on assets.    But much of that gain resulted from the one-time sale of redundant operations, and from profit of a subsidiary that was included in the first nine months of 1987, but not the year-earlier nine months. That unit, Arizona Bancwest Corp., earned $26.7 million in the first nine months of 1987, but a Security Pacific official said the actual contribution to the holding company was less because of allocated costs.    Wall Street had expected Security Pacific's loss and liked the rise in earnings before the loss provision. The common-stock price rose $1.25 yesterday to close at $30.50 a share in Big Board composite trading.    Wells Fargo   Wells Fargo continued to report big gains in earnings, mainly because of benefits from its May 1986 merger with Crocker National Corp. and from reductions in costs and domestic nonperforming assets.    The 42% jump in fourth-quarter earnings was accomplished despite a special $39 million addition to loss provisions for loans to developing countries. The addition raised Wells Fargo's reserve against such debt to the equivalent of 50%. Wells Fargo is the third Top Ten bank to increase such reserves to half or more. The other two are also California banks -- First Interstate Bancorp and Security Pacific.    Wells Fargo said that without special reserve additions and tax credits, it would have earned $116.6 million, or $2.05 a share, up 49% from the year-earlier quarter. Those earnings are equal to a 1% return on assets and a 20.2% return on equity, returns that make Wells Fargo one of the half-dozen most profitable big banks in the U.S.    Without special reserve additions and tax credits, earnings for the year would have been $382.6 million, or $6.69 a share, up 50% from 1986.    The company said its net interest income increased 8% in the fourth quarter, to $530.6 million, while non-interest expenses fell 6%, to $370.6 million. Non-interest income fell 14%, to $119.5 million, mainly because of investment-securities losses of $15.2 million. Wells Fargo continued to slash its domestic problem assets, which were down 15% at year-end to $877.7 million, compared with $1.03 billion at year-end 1986.    Well Fargo's common stock rose 37.5 cents yesterday to close at $46.375 a share in Big Board composite trading.    First RepublicBank   First RepublicBank is still struggling to recover from loans gone sour in the Southwestern economy. Its fourth-quarter loss reflected a loan-loss provision in the quarter of $340 million and a write-down of $53 million of foreclosed assets.    The company said in December it expected its fourth-quarter loss to be in the range of $325 million to $350 million.    First RepublicBank said its nonperforming assets as of Dec. 31 jumped to $3.9 billion, or 15.9% of total assets, from $3.1 billion, or 12.4%, as of Sept. 30. The company said 85% of the increase &quot;was due to real estate-related assets.&quot;    First RepublicBank's full-year loss included a second-quarter loan-loss provision of $325 million for loans to developing countries.    RepublicBank Corp. took over InterFirst Corp. last year to form First RepublicBank.    Although the loss was expected, First RepublicBank common shares fell 37.5 cents to close at $3.375 a share in Big Board composite trading yesterday.    Mellon Bank   Mellon Bank Corp. is still hemorrhaging from problem loans. The size of the fourth-quarter loss -- the third this year -- was $14 million larger than preliminary estimates and reflects additional provisions needed to cover possible credit losses.    Despite the severity of Mellon's current troubles, Chairman Frank Cahouet said the bank holding company will rebound in 1988 and will post a profit as early as the first quarter. In a statement, Mr. Cahouet contended that &quot;many of Mellon's business units are performing profitably,&quot; and stressed that the market position of the 119-year-old bank holding concern &quot;remains excellent.&quot;    Mellon said it increased its provision for credit losses by $183 million in the fourth quarter, of which $180 million was related to troubled Third World debt. Although the addition to the loan-loss provision primarily relates to international lending, Mellon noted that 42% of the bank's total fourth-quarter provision of $308 million is related to domestic loans. The provision was $40 million in the third quarter and $99 million in the fourth quarter of 1986.    Mellon, which has sustained heavy losses in several economically distressed Southwestern states, said it wrote off about $125 million in credit losses, including $60 million on loans to home builders and real estate developers and $29 million on loans to oil and gas-related borrowers.    Mellon said net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, fell 20% in the fourth quarter to $221 million from $278 million a year earlier. On this basis, income from tax-exempt and tax-favored assets is inflated to a level that would produce the same net income if the assets were fully taxable. Service revenue rose slightly to $158 million.    Mellon said its reserve for credit losses was $1.1 billion, or 5.59% of total loans, at year-end. Of that amount, $621 million, or 45% of medium-term and long-term loans, was related to certain Third World loans.    Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded the debt ratings on about $1.5 billion of Mellon Bank short-term and long-term securities. The credit-rating concern cited &quot;the potential for further asset-quality deterioration,&quot; caused by Mellon's exposure to regions of the nation that continue to display weakness, as the reason for the downgrade. Moody's also raised concerns about Mellon's leveraged buy-out portfolio which &quot;may be vulnerable to a general economic recession.&quot;    Moody's said it lowered Mellon Bank Corp.'s senior debt to Baa-2 from Baa-1, subordinated debt to Ba-1 from Baa-3 and preferred stock to Baa-3 from Baa-2. Also downgraded were the ratings on the debt of several Mellon subsidiaries, including Mellon Financial Co.'s senior debt, to Baa-2 from Baa-1, and its shelf registration of senior debt to provisional Baa-2 from provisional Baa-1.    Cuts in subsidiary ratings also included Mellon Bank's long-term deposits and long-term debt backed by Mellon's letter of credit, to single-A-3 from single-A-2; and short-term deposits and short-term debt backed by letters of credit, to Prime-2 from Prime-1.    Also downgraded were Mellon Bank East's long-term debt, to Baa-1 from single-A-3; and short-term deposits and short-term debt, to Prime-2 from Prime-1.    A Mellon spokeswomen said that company officials have not thoroughly reviewed the Moody's report, but said that Mellon officials are &quot;disappointed that the downgrading&quot; was necessary.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Mellon's common stock fell 25 cents to close at $25.75 a share.    ---                             1987            1986                          in      per     in      per    %                       millions  share millions  share  chg.
