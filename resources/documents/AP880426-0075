(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jessica Hahn says she would considerappearing on the PTL ministry's television show to help raisemoney, and says she wants the financially troubled ministry tosurvive.   ``People probably think I'm so anti-PTL. I'm completelyopposite,'' Miss Hahn said Monday. ``I don't want this dream todie. It's not (PTL founder) Jim Bakker's dream. God gave him thedream. ... I'd hate to see it die because one man felt he wasbigger than God.   ``I would encourage people: They better get a grip on what'sreally happening before it's too late and it's turned into ashopping center.''   Miss Hahn is the former church secretary whose sexual encounterwith Bakker led to his downfall. She said PTL must survive _ evenif it means bringing back Bakker and his wife.   ``I almost wish Jim and Tammy would go back,'' Miss Hahn toldThe Charlotte Observer from the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles,where she now lives. ``I'd hate to see that place lost. ... I'vealways said from day one that God did call this man.   ``I'm a little nervous saying this: But if Jim came back, Ibelieve he wouldn't mess up. People would be behind him, watchinghim.''   PTL, which has lost its tax exempt status, sued Miss Hahn lastweek for an estimated $160,000 remaining in a trust account thathad been promised her for not disclosing the 1980 tryst with Bakker.   Told of Miss Hahn's offer to appear on the show, PTL spokesmanDavid West chose his words carefully.   ``We would certainly welcome any sincere and genuine effort tohelp,'' West said. ``But at the present we think that havingJessica appear on the program might not be as helpful as she wouldwant it to be.''   Bakker has said he'd like to come back to rescue the ministry.But PTL's new leadership opposes Bakker's return.</TEXT></DOC>
