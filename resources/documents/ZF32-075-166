(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Like last year, it's important that we explain all the different variables inour chart so you can at least get a feel for the system vendors before youcall them.andP;  We'll skip over the first few categories - configuration andsystem price - because they're relatively self-explanatory.andM;Host Computer interfacesandM;Though the database in an IVR system can reside on the voice-processingsystem (a little more later), many times IVR goes to a separate computer (thehost) to get information.andP;  The following are the most common host interfacesfound in IVR.andM;* Asynchronous RS-232 (single port): This is the most common nonproprietaryinterface in the computer world.andP;  It's used a lot in IVR applications workingwith Tandem computers, Stratus computers, DEC VAX, PCs (every PC comes withan RS-232 port) and LAN gateways.andP;  And it's usually a cost effective way todo IVR and is good at handling exotic requirements you can drive protocolconverters to take care of bizarre protocols).andP;  Its limitation is itsbandwidth (approximately 19.2 Kbps).andP;  That's usually not fat enough to handlebig applications.andM;* Multi-Port Asynchronous RS232: See above.andP;  The only difference is its addedcapacity.andM;* IBM 3174/3274 Cluster Controller Emulation: IBM mainframes (there are abunch) let terminals hang off of them.andM;Those terminals are not booked up directly to the big computer.andP;  They'reconnected to a cluster controller.andP;  Up to 32 terminals can be hooked up to acluster controller.andP;  The controller is hooked up to the mainframe.andP;  It doesthings like take care of data presentation to and from the mainframe andgenerally streamlines communication between the terminals and the mainframe.andO;When an IVR system does cluster controller emulation, it replaces andultimately mimics this controller and its 32 terminals.andP;  So instead of having32 reps punching in, say, airline reservations, at each of the terminals, asingle IVR machine does it,  actually aping the way the people work at theterminals, even down to the key strokes - so you don't have to rewriteanything on the mainframe side (which  still thinks it's dealing with acluster controller)andM;* IBM 5251 Cluster Controller Emulation: This  is  for IBM's minicomputers.andO;It's a smaller cluster controller supporting up to eight terminals.andM;Works pretty much like above.andM;* Local  Area  Network interfaces: The key is looking like a node on thenetwork.andP;  But it's not just a matter of throwing a network card into the PC.andO;The IU system must access programs and data just like a human-run PC does.andM;* IBM 3278 Terminal Emulation: This is one of those terminals hanging off amainframe cluster controller.andM;* IVR makers can create systems that look like these too, so instead ofemulating an entire controller you mimic just one terminal.andM;* IBM 5250 Terminal Emulation: Same as above, just with IBM minis.andM;* Dumb TTY Terminal Emulation: A plain ASCII terminal still used a lot.andO;They're usually easy to emulate.andM;* VT 100/200 Terminal Emulation: DEC terminals which many other computermakers have adopted.andP;  They have a simple screen and are generally easy toemulate.andM;* Interface to Multiple Host Computers Simultaneously: You need to do thiswhen the data you need for your TVR application is on two or more computers.andM;* Automatic Log On/Log Off/Keepalive: This feature streamlines both the logon and log off procedures of the host computer and gets the IVR applicationinto or out of the appropriate program, which often times is complex,especially with mainframes.andP;  Keepalive prevents the host computer fromthrowing the IVR application off its resources after prolonged periods ofinactivity.andM;* Alarm for Host Down Condition: When the host goes down, this sends an alarmto the IVR system - audible and/or remote.andM;* Automatic Recovery from Host  Computer  Down Condition: This feature goesin and verifies and/or resets status according to what the TVR system needswhen the host goes down and boots up the system again when the host is ready.andM;* Pre/Post Processing of Host Transmissions: An important feature, this letsthe IVR system add things like a string of data before or after theinteraction with the host.andM;Database AccessandM;This stuff is for getting at databases residing on the IVR system.andM;* Read Only Access: You can only get information from the database.andP;  Youcan't put anything into it.andP;  You can't, in other words, update it.andM;* Read/Write Access: You can update the database.andM;* In Memory File Support: The data is held in RAM.andP;  It's real fast and goodfor applications where the database doesn't have to be huge - like a dealerlocator gig.andM;Complimentary ResourcesandM;* Fax: This is pretty hot these days.andP;  In IVR, it's a little more thanfax-on-demand, which is sort of audiotex fax.andP;  Here, it would send out uniquefaxs to each caller based on their unique, personal transaction.andM;* Text-to-Speech: Theoretically, this opens up some incredible applicationsfor IVR.andP;  You could really &quot;read&quot; a lot of information to callers.andM;* Voice Recognition: Besides being cute, this would let rotary-phone callersplay too.andM;ProgrammingandM;* Menu Driven Application Generator: A program that a non-programmer canhandle and build an IVR application with.andP;  Menu-driven, fill-in-the-blankssort of trip.andM;* Scrip Level Language: A program (actually a proprietary language) that anon-programmer couldn't understand.andP;  It's helpful, however, to get at trickyapplications.andP;  And a C-programmer can do a lot of work fast with them.andM;* C Programming Hooks: Sometimes an application will demand that a programmerwrite C code.andP;  Does the IVR system allow him/her to drop down from the abovementioned tools into this often times hellish world?andM;BIG IVR ANNOUNCEMENTandM;This just in (so we don't have as much as we would like to give you).andP;  IBMintroduced a product called Direct Talk/2 - an interactive voice responsesystem that works on Dialogic's voice-processing components another majorcoup for Dialogic).andM;The IBM PS/2-based system handles from four to 16 lines simultaneously, withspeaker-independent voice recognition over multiple channels.andP;  Dialogic'sDialog/81-MC Voice Communications System and LSI/80-MC Loop Start Interfaceprovide Direct Talk/2 users with voice input/output and telephony managementfunctions for up to eight phone lines simultaneously.andM;Already, the North Carolina Employment Security Commission is using theproduct to automate the filing of unemployment benefit claims.andP;  For severalyears, the state let claimants verify their unemployment status by answeringa series of questions on a post card.andP;  Based on initial results, claimantswho are using the IVR application to answer the questions are getting theirchecks up to four days faster.andP;  Furthermore, the voice-recognition feature inthe Direct Talk/2 product makes it possible for callers with rotary phones touse the application.andM;Direct Talk products can monitor applications and correct statistics on howoften they are used.andP;  This lets businesses refine applications.andP;  And theproduct also works with NetView, IBM's host network management product,providing real-time information about the system as well as the status ofindividual applications.andM;More soon on this big announcement.andM;HOLDLINKandM;Communications Unlimited's  Nashville, TN - 615-255-2 Holdlink subsidiaryoffers professional announcers and licensed background music forvoice-processing applications, including TVR.andP;  As they put it, &quot;we're analternative to using prepackaged synthesized voice or asking your secretaryto step up to the microphone.&quot;andM;TELEPHONE NEGATIVESandM;One reason computers can do more work faster than humans is that computersdon't have to answer the phone.andM;Bits andamp; PiecesandM;HUSBAND LOGICandM;A husband once complained to his wife, who was forty-plus and announcing thatshe was returning to college: &quot;You'll be 50 by the time you get your degree.&quot;andM;She replied, &quot;I'll be 50 anway.&quot;andM;ENHANCED'S NEW MODULEandM;Enhanced Systems  (Norcross, GA) introduced a new software module for theirPC-based Hello! system.andP;  It's called Telentry II.andP;  The TVR applicationsTelentry II gives Hello! include: automating customer or product support;coordinating dispatch functions; collecting reports from field personnel; andperforming inbound telemarketing surveys.andM;MICROLOG IVR CASE STUDYandM;The Situation - Anne Arundel County's domestic relations office andpermit/application center needed a system to handle their heavy call volumeand still get information on their services to the public.andP;  Both were gettingfrequent complaints from callers who spent excessive time on hold or couldn'tget through at all.andM;The Solution -  Me offices installed Microlog VCS 3500 voice-processingsystems.andP;  At domestic relations (responsible for child support enforcement),besides an auto attendant/audiotex app;lication which provides general infoto carrers such as office location and hours and can connect callers tosocial workers, they also set up an IVR system to give specific informationon individual cases, such as child support payments and arrearages.andO;Microlog's VCS 3500 interacts with an IBM 9121 through a 3745 controller.andO;Once in the system, callers enter their social-security number and theiraccount number to get an update on the status of their case.andM;Like domestic relations, the permit/application center is using the VCS 3500to give general information to the public while also providing TVR info.andP;  Intheir application, callers can check on the status of a permit application.andO;by punching in their permit number.andP;  The system echoes back the number forverification and then responds with the date of the application and whetherit has been approved or is still pending.andM;THE IMFAMOUS CARandM;I have a Porsche 959 which has become infamous because Of its inability to bedriven in the us  It doesn't meet our standards.andP;  It sits on the dock atOakland.andP;  The government won't let it in.andM;Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman</TEXT></DOC>
