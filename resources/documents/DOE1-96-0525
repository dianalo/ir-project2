Raising the temperature,however, which increases the vibrational energy, is restricted by reactionsthat tend to reduce the concentration of the working species. The speciesused as the vibrational-energy reservoir, molecular nitrogen or carbonmonoxide, determines what substantially different paths the ignitionof nitrous oxide may take. In this paper the authors examine the effectsof composition changes in nitrous oxide/nitrogen/helium and nitrous oxide/carbonmonoxide/helium mixtures on the gain as well as the cross effects ofnitrous oxide and carbon dioxide on the population inversion.</TEXT></DOC>
