 With each module priced at $750 and noadditional charge for network users, Data Pro is one of the least expensivepackages evaluated here.andP;  Manufacturing, time billing, client write-up, pointof sale, and other vertical- market applications priced from $750 to $1,850per module are also available.andM;PRODUCTIVITY TOOLSandM;Data Pro's start-up tools include an on-line tutorial, periodic processingchecklists, and on-line help.andP;  Productivity tools include a notepad,calendar, simple spreadsheet, and address book.andP;  The macro facility isextremely powerful, offering IF Statement branching, user prompts, and otherprogramming-like features.andP;  You can print reports to two different printersconcurrently and print in the background; both capabilities are realtime-savers.andM;The G/L allows up to ten characters for account numbers, which you can formatany way you choose for multiple levels of reporting.andP;  Unfortunately, there isno quick way to add a division; you must copy individual accounts from anexisting division to the new one.andM;By hitting Ctrl-F1, you can display period and year-to-date information atany time.andP;  A useful enhancement would be the ability to display transactiondetail for the same account.andM;CONSOLIDATING COMPANIESandM;Data Pro does a good job in multicompany processing and consolidations.andP;  Fromthe journal entry screen, you can enter transactions into separate companiesand Data Pro can automatically create the intercompany entries.andP;  The packagehandles up to 21 companies per consolidation, and consolidated companies canroll up into other companies.andP;  You can assign a percentage to each companyand allocate only that portion of its account balances to the consolidationcompany, a very useful feature for organizations with multiple partnershipsor joint ventures.andM;The A/P module has several unique functions: It can receive inventory intostock during invoice entry and handle &quot;prox&quot; payment terms.andP;  You can addvendors and inventory items on the fly during invoice entry.andP;  A/P handlesone-time vendors and recurring charges during invoice processing, but you arelimited to ten lines of distribution.andM;GOOD NEWS RECEIVABLESandM;Data Pro's A/R invoicing allows you to create and print invoices directly.andO;During Order Entry, you can assign unique payment terms with up to 360payment periods and allow for partial or extended payments.andP;  You can add acustomer on the fly during invoice entry but not during cash receipts entryor sales order entry.andM;Commissions are assigned and tracked by salesperson and can be paid based oncash received, total sales, or gross profit at time of sale.andP;  A salespersoncan have up to three commission rates, but only one salesperson is allowedper invoice.andP;  Many of the A/P reports provide salespeople with qualitativeinformation on customers.andM;SALES ORDER ENTRYandM;Data Pro's Sales Order Entry module allows five order types: normal,auto-cancel, special, drop ship, and proposal.andP;  Auto-cancel orders arecanceled if they are not shipped by the promised date, and special and dropship orders automatically create purchase orders.andP;  You can provide clients aquotation with the proposal order and convert it to a live order when theyaccept it.andM;In this module, you can change price level, discount, taxability, sales, andcost of sales accounts by line item, as well as print picking tickets by binnumber or part number, shipping labels, and bills of lading.andP;  You cannot addcustomers and inventory on the fly during order entry.andM;INVENTORY COSTING AND REPORTINGandM;All types of transactions affecting inventory, including sales orders,purchase orders, and receipts, are handled by Data Pro's Inventory module.andO;These transactions will update quantities and post financial data to the G/L.andO;You can cost inventory at average cost, last cost, standard cost, LIFO, orFIFO, but the limit of 20 cost layers per item may be a problem for somebusinesses.andM;Part numbers used for defining all attributes of an item can be up to 20characters long and have up to four segments.andP;  Multiple warehouses, multiplebins, colors, sizes, lengths, anything unique to the item must be included inthe part number structure.andM;Data Pro's flexible Inventory reporting provides an Inventory Turns report bymonth and year to date.andP;  A Stock Requirements Aging report tells you whatitems are required to fill open sales orders and spreads them over fouruser-defined periods to show you what you need to buy or make to meet demand.andM;On the Mixed Processing tests, Data Pro finished in the middle of the pack.andO;Slowed down by an over-5-hour Detail General Ledger Report test result, DataPro was disqualified from having its composite score tabulated.andM;CUSTOMIZATION AND SUPPORTandM;Data Pro also offers Stage 1, a low-end single-user package priced at $295per module, and for companies requiring greater performance from theiraccounting software, Infinity, which has the same functionality as Data ProAccounting Series but runs on non-Intel-based computers.andP;  User interfaces anddata files are compatible through each product line.andM;Program source code is not available, but Data Pro will modify software forcustomers on a fee basis.andP;  By the time you read this, Data Pro will havereleased a C- language interface that gives third-party developers readaccess to Data Pro data files.andM;Data Pro comes with 30 days of free telephone support and then charges a rateof $15 per 10-minute phone call.andP;  Charges for new releases are $100 permodule.andM;Data Pro is a relatively inexpensive accounting system that covers the basicswell.andP;  Its helpful productivity tools, variety of vertical market offerings,and ability to run on a number of Unix platforms can make the packageappealing to many businesses, even if it doesn't match some of the otherpackages reviewed here feature for feature.andM;Data Pro Accounting Series, Version 1.5andM;Data Pro Accounting Software Inc., 5439 Beaumont Center Blvd., #1050, Tampa,FL 33634;
