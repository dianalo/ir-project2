Financially struggling Texas Air Corp., Continental's parent,said Thursday the new A330 and A340 planes would allow Continentalto develop new markets and replace other planes in its fleet. Thecompany said it was the largest single order ever for both aircrafttypes.   Houston-based Texas Air, the nation's biggest airline company,said up to 10 of the new jets may be assigned to its EasternAirlines unit, which is struggling through an 8-month-old strikeand bankruptcy-court reorganization.   In May, Texas Air placed a $2.8 billion order for 100 Boeing737-300s, including 50 firm orders and 50 options.   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo, who earlier this year said thefallout from the Eastern strike might prompt the sale of sisterContinental, told a news conference Thursday that Texas Air'sdirectors would consider such a sale ``in due course.'' He refusedto comment further.   The unions representing machinists, ground workers, pilots andflight attendants have been on strike against Miami-based Easternsince March 4. The airline is trying to rebuild under Chapter 11bankruptcy protection and has replaced the union workers.   In response to the Airbus order, a spokesman for the strikingEastern pilots said the deal showed Texas Air was building upHouston-based Continental to the detriment of Eastern.   ``That's been the plan all along; that's the reason that Easternis in the condition it's in,'' said pilots union spokesman Skip Orrin Boston.   Texas Air reported last week that it lost $158 million in thethird quarter, up from a loss of $114.1 million in third quarter1988, due to continued losses by Eastern that offset profits atContinental.   The medium- and long-range Airbus jets ordered by Continentalinvolve ``very revolutionary new concepts'' such as advancedcomputerized controls and built-in test equipment, Lorenzo said.The planes can be flown by two-pilot crews rather than thetraditional three for larger aircraft.   The jets are made by Airbus Industrie, a European consortiumthat competes with Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. of theUnited States.   Lorenzo said Texas Air had secured ``reasonable'' financing fromAirbus as part of the transaction, but hadn't made a final decisionon whether it will finance the deal that way.   Also participating in the news conference were Jean Pierson,managing director of Airbus, and Continental's new president,Mickey Foret. Foret recently replaced Joseph Corr, who resignedafter less than 10 months on the job. While remaining as Texas Airchairman, Lorenzo was named Continental's chairman and chiefexecutive officer, positions Corr also held.   The jet order consists of 10 firm orders and 10 options for theA330, and another 10 orders and 10 options for the A340. Texas Airhas the right to vary the distribution of plane types. Deliveriesare to begin in February 1993.   Separately Thursday, Airbus officials in Paris confirmed theyhave held advanced talks with the Soviet airline Aeroflot for anorder of Airbus A310 jets. News reports have said the SovietUnion's national carrier plans to buy five A310s and take optionson five others.   In addition, Air France announced it plans to finalize an orderfor seven Airbus A340-300 jets Monday and take options on fouradditional planes.</TEXT></DOC>
