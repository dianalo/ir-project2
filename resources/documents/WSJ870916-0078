SchlesingerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> F LABORAUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><DATELINE> DEARBORN, Mich.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ford Motor Co. and the United Auto Workers union moved closer toward a tentative agreement guaranteeing a certain number of jobs at each U.S. facility as part of a comprehensive job security plan.    The No. 2 auto maker offered to protect all 104,000 workers against layoff except during a &quot;major&quot; sales drop, sources close to the negotiations said. Ford also has offered to replace half of all workers who leave -- slowing, but not stopping, attrition.    The UAW appeared willing to accept that &quot;flexibility&quot; to its initial demand that the size of the work force be protected at its current level regardless of circumstances. But the two sides were debating over how much leeway the company should get, the sources added.    Such an agreement could prove one of the strongest job guarantees reached so far at a major U.S. manufacturer.    It wasn't clear what the union had agreed to in return. But the company has sought major changes in work rules at individual plants. The UAW accepted that trade-off for similar job guarantees it received earlier this year from Case IH, an agricultural equipment company. That pact, though it had several loopholes, is considered the UAW's strongest job-security plan secured to date.    One UAW source said that if the union gets a strong job guarantee program from Ford, &quot;we will do some things in the area of work rules we wouldn't have discussed before.&quot;    That progress apparently was what persuaded the UAW to make the unusual decision of extending the contract on a day-to-day basis beyond the deadline that came Monday at midnight EDT.    Although neither side set another deadline, UAW President Owen Bieber said he would push to get an agreement by Friday, when 200 delegates from Ford union locals around the country are scheduled to arrive in Dearborn for a report on the status of negotiations.    Mr. Bieber, at a news conference late Monday, stressed that a strike was still possible against Ford. &quot;Obviously, we look optimistically at reaching an agreement,&quot; he said. &quot;But if we don't make it, we still have all of our other options available to us.&quot;    Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, where prices were down sharply, Ford shares fell $2.125 to $104.625.    Union and company officials noted that this was the first time in recent memory in major auto negotiations that the UAW extended a contract at a &quot;target&quot; company more than a few hours without calling a strike. The UAW two weeks ago picked Ford over General Motors Corp. as its target to reach a pattern-setting contract. GM talks are on hold pending a settlement at Ford.    Chrylser Corp.'s U.S. contract doesn't expire until next year.    &quot;We have proceeded very, very carefully in trying to plow new ground-it's taken time,&quot; said Peter J. Pestillo, Ford's vice president overseeing the talks, in explaining the need for an extension.    &quot;We're very pleased with our relationships with our people and our trade unions,&quot; Mr. Pestillo added. &quot;I think it's important to note the courage it sometimes takes for a trade unionist to extend an agreement when the typical behavior is one of 'no contract, no work.'&quot;    Also, with growing imports and the spread of Japanese-owned plants in the U.S., a strike would cost both sides more than ever before. That message has become clear throughout American industry. Strikes have declined steadily from a decade ago, when 1.5 million workers participated in 231 major strikes: In 1986, U.S. unions called 69 major strikes involving 533,000 workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.    But even if the UAW does reach a peaceful settlement at Ford, it may not make it through this fall without a strike. GM has said repeatedly that it won't match a Ford job-security pact, because the No. 1 auto maker makes more parts internally.    Indeed, the Ford contract extension may simply be part of a UAW strategy to save its resources for the company where negotiations may be tougher and a strike more necessary.    Most union local officers contacted supported the contract extension. Some, however, complained the move raised questions about the union's resolve. It &quot;gives the upper hand to the company,&quot; said Jim Kelly, a bargaining committeeman at Local 2000 at Ford's assembly plant in Avon Lake, Ohio. A strike &quot;would have shown we meant what we were saying,&quot; he added.    The job-security framework apparently agreed upon would fall short of the UAW's original demand. The union two weeks ago asked the company to guarantee the current number of jobs with no attrition and regardless of market forces.    But it would still strengthen current job security programs. In 1984, Ford agreed to protect individual workers whose jobs disappeared because of technology, productivity improvements, and the transfer of work to other companies. That contract, however, did nothing to directly stem attrition, or to protect workers from market forces. </TEXT></DOC>
