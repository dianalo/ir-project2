The conductor was Sian Edwards, the first woman to conduct atCovent Garden. She made her debut with the baton there in April 1988.   The production was staged by Spanish director Nuria Espert.   The season began 24 hours after Lord Sainsbury, chairman of theopera house, issued an annual report saying 1988 was a year ofsignificant achievement, with higher income and attendances, butpredicting a deficit of between $1.5 million and $3.1 million thisyear.   Sainsbury complained the government subsidy, amounting to justover two-thirds of income, had not kept pace with inflation.   An early major event of the season is a new production by Germandirector Goetz Friedrich on Sept. 27 of ``The Valkyrie,'' the secondof Richard Wagner's four-part ``The Ring of the Nibelungen.'' U.S.bass-baritone James Morris will lead the cast as Wotan.   Friedrich was summoned in December to take charge of the rest ofthe ``Ring'' cycle after differences with Soviet producer YuriLyubimov about the staging of the first part, ``The Rhine Gold.''   Lyubimov argued at length during rehearsals with the RoyalOpera's Dutch music director, Bernard Haitink, over presentation ofthe work.   The eventual production won the acclaim of most of the audiencesand every seat was sold for the six performances.   But the backstage argument could not be resolved.   Friedrich will be developing ``The Ring'' cycle he began in WestBerlin and later adapted for touring in Japan and the United States.The Royal Opera has changed some scenery and costumnes.   The third part of the cycle, ``Siegfried,'' will be produced nextyear and the fourth part, ``The Twilight of the Gods,'' in 1991,when the whole cycle will be performed.   Eight other new productions are scheduled: ``Peter Grimes'' byBenjamin Britten, ``Medea'' by Luigi Cherubini, ``Idomeneo'' byWolfgang Amadeus Mozart, ```Prince Igor'' by Alexsandr Borodin,``Elektra'' by Richard Strauss, ``La Cenerentola'' and ``WilliamTell'' by Gioacchino Rossini and ``The Cunning Little Vixen'' byLeos Janacek.</TEXT></DOC>
