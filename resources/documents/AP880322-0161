Hewas 74.   Steptoe, a gynecologist and obstetrician who pioneered the invitro fertilization technique with physiologist Robert Edwards,died Monday night at Chaucer Hospital in Canterbury.   On Tuesday, he was to have been decorated by Queen Elizabeth IIas a Commander of the British Empire, an honor one step below aknighthood, for services to his country.   An expert in infertility, Steptoe also was to have received theBritish Medical Association's Gold Medal, one of the profession'shighest awards, at its annual meeting in July.   ``Mr. Steptoe made an invaluable contribution to medicine andraised the honor and dignity of the profession,'' the associationsaid. British surgeons use the designation ``Mr.'' instead of``Dr.''   The test-tube baby technique gave hope to millions of childlesscouples and spawned a range of fertility treatments for both menand women.   More than 1,000 test-tube babies have been born as a result oftreatment at Bourn Hall Clinic, near Cambridge, run by Steptoe andEdwards, and thousands of others have born elsewhere in the world.   ``It is a very great loss to Bourn Hall and to me personally,''Edwards said. ``In the last three years, he was working underconsiderable difficulties but carried on.   ``He wished to do service to his patients for as long aspossible.''   Truck driver John Brown, father of Louise Joy Brown, the world'sfirst test-tube baby, said he and his wife, Lesley, ``are foreverin his debt.''   ``There is no way we, or any other couples Mr. Steptoe helped,can possibly repay him for what he has given them,'' Brown said.   Louise was born on July 25, 1978, in Oldham, England. Four yearslater, the Browns had a second test-tube baby, Natalie Jane.   The birth of Louise Brown, the first human conceived outside thewomb, was hailed as a medical breakthrough on the order of thefirst heart transplant. But some people were horrified, seeing itas the dawn of a ``Brave New World'' of baby farms and geneticengineering.   ``I am not a wizard or a Frankenstein,'' Steptoe once said.   ``All I want to do is help women whose child-producing mechanismis slightly faulty.''   Under the in vitro fertilization technique, which actuallyinvolves no test tubes, eggs are removed from the prospectivemother and fertilized with the intended father's sperm in a glassdish. The resulting embryo is then implanted in the mother's womb.   It took 10 years for Edwards and Steptoe to develop thetechnique.   Working at Cambridge University, Edwards worked out theprocedure for fertilizing eggs in a laboratory dish, and Steptoeadapted a technique known as laparoscopy, a way of seeing andoperating inside the abdomen by inserting a tube with a fiber opticlight.   Originally intended for women who were unable to conceivebecause of blocked Fallopian tubes, in vitro fertilization hasgiven rise to such procedures as embryo freezing, egg and spermdonation, embryo transfer and surrogate motherhood.   Steptoe, who was born on June 9, 1913, qualified as a doctor in1939 and immediately went into World War II service as a Royal Navysurgeon. He was a prisoner of war in Italy from 1941 to 1943, andwas discharged with the rank of surgeon lieutenant commander in1946.   He worked as an obstetrician in state hospitals, moving in 1951to Oldham, a northern England city where in the fall of 1967 heteamed up with Edwards.   In 1984, a furor erupted over allegations that they hadexperimented on embryos, although the scientists later insistedthey had only observed embryos.   The same year, the team proposed implanting embryos into animalsto determine whether some conditions favorable to fertility existin the animal's uterus but not in a woman's. The idea eventuallywas dropped.   But Steptoe said he and Edwards never thought their work was inany way unethical. ``We are not creating life,'' he said. ``We havemerely done what many people try to do in all kinds of medicine _to help nature.''   Steptoe said the greatest contribution of their work wouldlikely be in early embryo research into genetic diseases.   He is survived by his wife, Sheena, and a son and daughter.Funeral arrangements were incomplete.</TEXT></DOC>
