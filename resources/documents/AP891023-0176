Hungarian flags of red, white and green waved over the throng,which overflowed the Parliament square. People cheered wildly inthe torch-lit plaza when participants in the uprising invokedmemories of its leaders.   ``It took 33 years for those behind the thick walls to hear thecries'' for democracy, Jenoe Fonay, a prominent activist who wasearlier involved in the uprising, told the rally. He was referringto the recent official change of heart about the nature of the12-day revolt that began Oct. 23, 1956.   The Soviet bloc's bloodiest uprising was calledcounterrevolution until early this year, when the officialdescription was changed to a popular uprising in one of thedramatic moves in Hungary's progress toward democracy.   As many as 32,000 people were killed in 1956 and about 200,000fled the country.   Gyula Obersovszky, a writer and editor who was sentenced todeath but later pardoned, said: ``I am keeping my fingers crossedfor Gorbachev.'' The crowd called out ``Gorby! Gorby!''   ``History has taught us that as long as Moscow is not free, wecannot be free either,'' Obersovszky said.   He expressed certainty that ``the suppression of the revolutionwould not have taken place'' if Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Sovietleader who champions reform, and President Bush had led thesuperpowers in 1956.   A banner proclaiming ``Freedom, Independence'' was draped acrossthe main entrance of Parliament and floodlights bathed thestructure.   Gyoergy Krasso, a vocal opposition figure jailed for his part inthe uprising, drew one of the strongest ovations when he declared:``We've had enough of Russian occupation!''   Without mentioning names, he appealed to East European allieswho oppose reforms to ``help us and not make it more difficult.''   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwilersaid: ``Declaring itself an independent republic on the 33rdanniversary of the popular uprising seems particularly appropriate.We congratulate the Republic of Hungary and its people.''   Hungarian national TV broadcast the entire rally, its cameraspanning frequently from the cheering crowd to the balcony with itslarge photograph of Imre Nagy, who led the 1956 revolt and wasexecuted. Nagy's body was exhumed and reburied with honor in June.   Some speakers recited patriotic poems, including one that began:``The streets of Budapest are running with blood.''   The evening rally followed a proclamation by acting PresidentMatyas Szueroes formally declaring Hungary a democracy after 41years of communist rule.   Szueroes declared the communist ``People's Republic of Hungary''dead from the balcony of Parliament, to the applause of 100,000people who had filled the square by midday.   ``As of today, our nation's ... name is the Republic ofHungary,'' he said, and church bells throughout the country pealedat noon.   State TV also broadcast the midday ceremony, the firstcommemoration of the uprising ever conducted with official approval.   Many people wore arm bands or hair ribbons in the nationalcolors, or waved large flags with jagged holes in the middle tosymbolize those of 1956 from which rebels cut the communist emblem.   Tears flowed freely as the crowd sang the national anthem on theanniversary, which Parliament declared a day of ``nationalreconciliation.'' Teachers took their entire classes to the square.Few police were visible, and none carried firearms or clubs.   Hoots and whistles rose when Szueroes called for continuedcooperation with the Soviet Union. The crowd cheered and applaudedwhen he urged warmer ties with the United States.   The applause was tumultuous applause when he said: ``TheRepublic of Hungary has become a state governed by law, where thevalues of ... democracy and democratic socialism are equallyvalid.''   Smaller rallies were held between the two mass events in thesquare.   Opposition leader Gyula Kiss said at one, ``Let us vow to finishthe revolution they had begun!'' and the crowd of about 10,000replied ``We swear! We swear!''   Two weeks ago, the ruling Communist Party dissolved itself infavor of a successor Socialist Party favoring democratic ideals andmultiparty elections. The party issued a statement Friday rejectingthe Soviet invasion of 1956.</TEXT></DOC>
