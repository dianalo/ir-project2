But a look at those costs suggests they may not bequite so bad.&quot; Rising jet-fuel costs are very bad for theU.S. airline industry and I believe a few facts shoulddemonstrate that point clearly.   Airline jet-fuel costs are essentially a fixed percentageof per-barrel crude-oil prices. That percentage for the pastseveral years has held at 3.5%. Thus, before the recentMiddle Eastern crisis, crude oil at $18 a barrel broughtabout 63 cents a gallon for jet fuel. If the current fuelcrisis places crude-oil prices at, say, $25 a barrel, U.S.airlines will pay about 88 cents a gallon for fuel, a rise of25 cents a gallon. These increases occur immediately; thereare no long-term price contracts anymore, not even 30-daycontracts. Every one-cent rise in jet fuel increases airlineexpenses by $160 million annually. A rise of 25 cents raisesthe jet-fuel costs $4 billion annually.</LP><TEXT>   I consider that quite bad, so bad that even as theairlines raise their fares about 5.3%, which is not enough,to try and recover these increased fuel costs, theirprofitability outlook diminishes. It moves from an earlier$500 million operating profit for 1990 to a $1 billionoperating loss.   George W. James   Chairman   Airline Economics Inc.   Washington   ---   You state that travel-agent commissions account for 13% ofevery travel dollar, basing this on a RunzheimerInternational analysis of a New York-Los Angeles sample trip.   The 13% is highly overstated. On domestic tickets,airlines pay 9.26% commissions based on consumer cost (theypay 10% of the base fare, which is less than consumer costbecause of an 8% tax). Car-rental companies pay only 5% onmost rentals, and even less on corporate rates. The standardcommission paid by U.S. hotels is 10%. In addition, it isfrequently difficult if not impossible to collect commissionsfrom hotel and car-rental companies.   I know of no way to average 9.26, 5 and 10 and get 13.
