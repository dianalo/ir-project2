Since the operator must employ deep reasoning about system behaviorto diagnose such a fault, the performance may be restricted by cognitivelimitations and biases. A computer aid based on a qualitative model ofthe system was built to help the operator overcome some of his/her cognitivelimitations. This aid differs from most expert systems in that it operatesat several levels of interaction believed to be more suitable for deepreasoning. Four aiding approaches, each of which provided unique informationto the operator, were evaluated. The aiding features were designed tohelp the human's causal reasoning about the system in predicting normalsystem behavior (N aiding), integrating observations into actual systembehavior (O aiding), finding discrepancies between the two (O-N aiding),or finding discrepancies between observed behavior and hypothetical behavior(O-H aiding). Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the aidingapproaches and to investigate the nature of deep-reasoning diagnosis.</TEXT></DOC>
