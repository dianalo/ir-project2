At San Francisco's Wells Fargo andamp; Co., flexible work schedules and employee counseling programs hold down worker absences. &quot;Companies now recognize that workers' lives are complex,&quot; says Stephen Enna, the firm's personnel director. After Johnson andamp; Johnson Co. found that its health promotion plan cut absences 15%, it began marketing the system to other concerns.    But other companies favor simply letting workers know the ground rules. Duke University's employee-relations director, Edmund Diaz, favors a &quot;no-fault&quot; system that lets workers know they will be penalized after a certain number of absences regardless of the reason. At Miami's DWG Corp., lenience is out and &quot;getting down to brass tacks is in,&quot; says a spokesman.    Job scarcity solved the problem in Houston. &quot;People are more serious about their work attitudes,&quot; says a spokesman for Kent Electronics Corp.    CORPORATE CUTBACKS create heavier workloads for remaining managers.    John Blake, an American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. manager in New York, says his work increased &quot;enormously&quot; after cutbacks last year. At General Motors Corp., where officials plan to cut 25,000 employees, managers report a new corporate culture. &quot;We're working a lot harder because we feel we're not No. 1 anymore,&quot; says Joseph Fitzsimmons, Jr., a manager at GM's Buick division.    A recent survey of major concerns shows that many managers &quot;drop the ball as they stagger under heavier workloads,&quot; says Allan Prager of Cresap, San Francisco-based management consultants. Still, an executive at Manufacturers Hanover Bank worries about having enough stimulating work for his best subordinates because recruiters may call them during staff reductions.    PAY INCREASES slowed last year for top executives at publicly held thrifts.    Salaries and bonuses for executives at those thrifts climbed about 7% in 1986, half the previous year's increase, says MCS Associates of Newport Beach, Calif., which tracks the industry's compensation. Last year's rash of unprofitable loans slowed the increase. Of 220 companies surveyed, one-third paid top executives $250,000 or more, 8% paid them $500,000 or more and three firms paid their top officers over $1 million.    Bonuses for thrifts' senior managers weren't as popular, the survey revealed: Only 4% of the institutions used them last year compared with 11% in 1985. &quot;Instead of handing out what are, in effect, Christmas turkeys, they're now linking pay to performance,&quot; says Jon Rosenbaum of MCS.    The use of employment contracts to protect executives after a takeover also increased 10% over the last two years.    A TEAMSTERS UNION CONTRACT with United Parcel Service was barely rejected 36,093 to 35,036 in a rank-and-file vote. But the Teamsters declared the result an endorsement, invoking a clause in the union constitution that says the leadership can call an agreement ratified, lacking a two-thirds &quot;no&quot; vote.    MAJOR RETAILERS might see their benefits costs double if a law requiring minimum health benefits passes, a survey by Towers Perrin Forster andamp; Crosby indicates. Few retailers offer coverage to all part-time employees and many workers are insured through a spouse's company. The proposed law would require coverage for each worker.    STATE EMPLOYEES will continue to feel the pinch of cost-cutting measures in fiscal 1988, says the National Association of State Budget Officers. The group's preliminary data show workers won't get a raise in 13 states, and pay increases will be modest in most others. Several states also will offer early retirement options.    ETHNIC MINORITIES' presence on corporate boards increased to 30% last year from 25% in 1985, says Korn/Ferry International, recruiters. The firm's survey of 532 companys shows that 55% of retailers' boards have minority group members and 53% of financial institutions' boards do.    GOOD FOLLOWERS at work are savvy and independent, says a professor.    Such followers aren't passive or sheeplike, says Robert Kelley, adjunct professor of management at Carnegie-Mellon University. They are the best employees because they are self-starters who manage themselves and their relationship with the boss. They figure out what the boss needs to satisfy his superiors. They are leaders in other settings and know that little gets done when several people vie for the leadership role.    Research over the last two years involving hundreds of executives helped Prof. Kelley outline other effective followers' traits. He says they care very much about something: perhaps the company, its product or even the boss. They have a conscience and aren't afraid to say something is a bad idea or unethical.    But bosses dislike the idea that subordinates might develop a relationship with them, his studies show.    THE CHECKOFF: On his last day at work, a summer associate for a Houston law firm got a letter saying he must verify his citizenship -- within 72 hours of when he was hired -- or be fired. . . . A speech by Gene Upshaw, head of the Professional Athletes Union, was canceled last week because he wouldn't cross NBC workers' picket lines at the National Press Building in Washington. </TEXT></DOC>
