In particular, thepetitioner requested reconsideration of 49 CFR 191.23(a)(6), a rule which,with some exceptions, requires the reporting of leaks that constitute anemergency involving certain gas pipelines and LNG facilities. After reviewingthe petition and letters of support by The New England Gas Association,the Bay State Gas Company, the Connecticut Light and Power Company, andthe American Gas Association, the Research and Special Programs Administration(RSPA) finds that sufficient information or arguments have not been presentedto justify granting the petition. Therefore, for the reasons set forthbelow, the petition is hereby denied.Basically the petitioner argues that because the meaning of ``emergency''is indefinite, enforcement personnel and operators will disagree over whichleaks are reportable as emergencies. The petitioner further asserts thatthis situation is worsened by the lack of a reporting exception under andSection;191.23(b) for unsafe conditions that are mitigated by venting or othermeans before the filing deadline, but not corrected by repair or replacementuntil sometime later. To firm up the rule, the petitioner suggests theaddition of a clarifying sentence that would narrowly define emergencyleaks as those ``caused by a natural disaster where gas in air exists insidea building that is beyond the flammable limit.'' However, the petitionerdid not explain why this emergency should be the only one reportable underandSection; 191.23(a)(6).RSPA recognizes that ``emergency'' is not a precise term. It is not, however,a term foreign to the gas pipeline safety regulations. Under a rule inexistence since 1976 (49 CFR 192.615), operators of gas pipelines are requiredto have written procedures to identify and respond to emergency events.Some of the pipeline emergencies the procedures must cover are identifiedin andSection; 192.615(a)(3), while others are left to the operator to identify.Likewise, 49 CFR 193.2509 requires operators to identify and respond toemergencies involving LNG facilities. Experience in complying with theseregulations will provide a solid basis for identifying emergency leaksthat are reportable under andSection; 191.23(a)(6).An ``emergency'' connotes a hazardous situation demanding immediate correctiveaction to protect life or property compared to one where corrective actionmight be postponed. This distinction was emphasized in the preamble ofAmendment 191-6, and examples were given to illustrate types of emergencyleaks to which andSection; 191.23(a)(6) applies. The preamble set forth thatexamples of leaks that may constitute an emergency are those that occurin residential or commercial areas in conjunction with a natural disaster,those where flammable vapor is detected inside a building, and those thatinvolve response by police or fire departments (53 FR 24945). In addition,the preamble explained that andSection; 191.23(a)(6) is aimed at leaks thatare ``glaring hazardous conditions'' rather than leaks that require ``promptrepair'' as originally proposed in the notice.While the grading of leaks as used in industry may be indicators of thegravity of the leak, they are not necessarily indicators of an emergencyas described above. While certain leaks called ``Grade 1'' or ``C'' leaksin industry parlance require ``prompt'' action, they would not have tobe reported unless they are emergencies, such as where a flammable vaporis detected at or near the lower explosive limit inside a building or havealready involved a non-routine response by police or fire departments.OPS recognizes the value of accepted industry standard classificationsfor leaks and does not intend in this rule to discourage the use of establishedclassification systems. There is no intent to cause a change in standardclassificaitons merely for the purpose of identifying safety-related conditions.Furthermore, leaks that are not emergencies may be mitigated by pressurereduction and venting. RSPA, in discussing reasons for not including pressurereduction and venting as an exception to reporting an unsafe condition(53 FR 24946), did not intend to preclude these mitigating measures forleaks that are not emergencies. As set forth in andSection; 191.25(a), anoperator would have to determine if a leak is an emergency and, if so,file a report within five days after the ``determination'' but no longerthan 10 days after ``discovery'' of the leak.Potential differences of opinion between operators and enforcement personnelover which leaks are reportable under andSection; 191.23(a)(6) should befurther minimized by instructions operators must add to their operatingand maintenance (Oandamp;M) plans. Under the new andSection; 192.605(f), operatorsmust put in their Oandamp;M plans instructions enabling personnel to recognizeconditions that potentially are reportable under andSection; 191.23, includingleaks that foreseeably could be emergencies reportable under andSection;191.23(a)(6).In view of the long-standing requirements that operators have proceduresto identify and respond to emergencies involving leaks in pipelines andLNG facilities, the clarifying statements included in the preamble of Amendment191-6, and the requirement to describe in Oandamp;M plans leaks that maybe emergencies, RSPA believes that operators will have little difficultyin applying andSection; 191.23(a)(6). Similarly, there should be few disputeswith enforcement personnel over which leaks constitute an emergency. Therefore,it does not appear that the petitioner's suggested amendment would enhancethe general understanding of emergency leaks. Rather, it would confineandSection; 191.23(a)(6) to a particular type of emergency, when such a restrictionwas clearly not intended.<ITAG tagnum="20">(49 App. U.S.C. 1672, 49 CFR 1.53)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC on September 16, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">M.
