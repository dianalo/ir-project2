SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two top West German officials ran into stiffU.S. resistance today as they met with Secretary of State James A.Baker III and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to press for an earlyround of negotiations with the Soviet Union aimed at reducingshort-range nuclear missiles.   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense MinisterGerhard Stoltenberg held hurriedly arranged talks at the StateDepartment on the touchy issue of NATO missile deployment.   As they met, Margaret Tutwiler, the department spokeswoman,quoted Baker as saying ``it would be a mistake'' to hold suchnegotiations and that he thought the problem should be worked outwith the West Germans before the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationsummit meeting in Brussels at the end of May.   President Bush, who will meet in the Belgian capital with theWestern leaders, said he had appealed to West German ChancellorHelmut Kohl ``that we keep NATO together, that we stay together,''   Bush, who was traveling outside Washington, said Kohl, who hassought a delay in modernizing the U.S.-built Lance missiles,``knows my view that there must not be any unilateal fait accomplihere.''   The president's national security assistant, Brent Scowcroft,attended the talks Baker and Cheney held with the two West Germanministers. Bush spoke with Kohl by telephone last Friday.   The United States and Britain are concerned that negotiating themissiles issue with the Soviets could lead to stripping the NATOallies of their ground-based nuclear weaponry, leaving them at themercy of stronger Warsaw Pact conventional forces.   Baker was expected to underscore this position to the WestGermans, while British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will fly toBonn on Sunday to try to dissuade Kohl.   The idea of holding talks on the missiles has gained favorrecently in West Germany, where the government coalition headed byKohl is facing an erosion of popularity and is under extremepressure to push for the talks.   The missiles are a subject of irritation in West Germany.Because of their short range, the nuclear-tipped missiles aredesigned to be used almost exclusively on West German territory.   Also, the German public has been expressing waning interest indeploying a new generation of missiles while Soviet leader MikhailGorbachev has been cutting back his forces in Eastern Europe.   Diplomatic sources told The Associated Press that the Germanofficials had requested a meeting with Bush because of theimportance of their mission.   Bush, however, went today to Norfolk, Va., for the USS Iowamemorial service. So a quickly arranged luncheon with the secretaryof state was sought instead.   The diplomatic sources, who asked not to be identified by name,said the request for the meetings was made on Friday. Theannouncement that the meeting had been scheduled came just a fewhours later.   The request came one day after North Atlantic TreatyOrganization defense ministers in Brussels ended a two-day sessionby sidestepping the short-range missile quandary.   The United States and Britain argued in favor of producing anddeploying a more modern version of the missile, while the severalEuropean nations pressed for early negotiations with the Soviet-ledWarsaw Pact.   Kohl wants NATO to postpone a decision on modernizing themissiles until after his country's national elections in December1990.   U.S. officials agreed to delay such a decision, but want to moveforward on research and development of the newer version.   Officials on both sides of the Atlantic are expressing fearsthat the alliance will not be able to forge a common approach onthe matter prior to the summit of NATO leaders scheduled to be heldin May.   A clash over the issue is expected to come to a head soon,because few want a crisis to mar President Bush's debut sessionwith the leaders of the alliance, which is also celebrating its40th anniversary this year.   The May 29-30 session in Brussels is designed to forge ablueprint for the 16-nation pact's future arms control strategy.   The missile decision is also an issue of vital domesticpolitical importance to the Kohl government.   The State Department meeting comes in the wake of talks heldamong the leaders of the West German government's governingcoalition parties. At that meeting, the leaders of Bavaria'sconservative Christian Social Union Party agreed to drop theirlongstanding opposition to early talks on the missiles.   The group also supported Kohl's view that the West Germangovernment need not decide on the deployment of the modernizedweapons until 1991 or 1992.   Kohl's Christian Democratic Union has suffered badly in recentlocal elections and has been trailing the left-leaning SocialDemocrats since the first of the year in nationwide polls.</TEXT></DOC>
