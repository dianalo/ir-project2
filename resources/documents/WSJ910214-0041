Alaska Attorney General Charles Cole, who has beennegotiating with the company along with federal agenciesinvolved in the case, went to Washington, D.C., to meetrepresentatives of the federal agencies. Alaska Gov. WalterJ. Hickel is expected to be in Washington by today. Anagreement could be signed soon.</LP><TEXT>   There is also strong pressure to settle federal criminalcharges against Exxon, but neither the company nor theJustice Department has indicated that a plea bargain isimminent. There hasn't yet been any contacts between Exxonand the Justice Department, individuals familiar with thecase said.   Individuals familiar with the talks say tentative terms ofthe settlement place the value at less than $1 billionbecause Exxon will pay out the money over a period of timerather than in a lump sum. Payments are expected to spanpossibly 10 years, putting the present value of thesettlement at no more than $800 million by the most generousestimates. The settlement would be in addition to the $2.5billion Exxon spent on the cleanup.   Of that amount $35 million would be allocated to continuecleanup efforts this year. A $200 million payment would bemade up front to set up a restoration fund. Another $160million would be paid to cover costs incurred by the stateand federal government relative to the spill. Money would beallocated by three federal trustees and one state trustee.   Mr. Cole said in an interview late yesterday that noagreement had yet been reached on the amount or the terms ofpayment. &quot;It's been very hard bargaining; don't think it'sjust a done deal,&quot; he said. &quot;Negotiations could collapse onany of a number of issues. They're hanging by a spider'sthread.&quot;   Exxon officials declined to comment on whether the companyis in settlement talks.   Meanwhile, environmental groups are asking that talks beplaced on hold until they can examine the data on which thesettlement is to be based, according to Sarah Chasis,attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, whichrepresents 11 environmental groups that have litigationpending concerning the spill.   Lloyd Miller, an Anchorage lawyer, figures spacing thepayments out over 10 years gives the settlement an actualcurrent value of only about $650 million. Mr. Miller, aspokesman for lawyers who have filed scores of private civilsuits against Exxon on behalf of fishermen and others, saidGov. Hickel disclosed the installment plan to a group ofcommunity leaders in Juneau Tuesday.   &quot;It is our opinion that a $650 million settlement is asevere undervaluation of the natural resources damage causedby the oil spill, and that if this deal goes through, thestate and federal governments have been severely outdealed byExxon,&quot; said Mr. Miller. He said it was also &quot;irresponsible&quot;for the government to settle the case now because the fullextent of the damage from the spill isn't yet known.   On Friday, the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, along withthe Natural Resources Defense Council and the NationalWildlife Federation, wrote to Gov. Hickel of their &quot;seriousconcern&quot; of settlement terms as reported by the media.   Among the groups' concerns, according to Eric Jorgensen,an attorney for the Sierra Club fund in Juneau, is that thegovernment might agree to allowing Exxon to have some sayover how the settlement funds are disbursed.   In Washington, Justice Department officials publiclyinsisted that prosecutors are continuing to prepare for acriminal trial beginning April 10. Exxon in recent weekshasn't formally approached the department about arranging aplea bargain to settle the criminal charges. Federalprosecutors weren't directly involved in yesterday's talks,although the Justice Department is monitoring thosediscussions.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who bitterly resentedcriticism of the department's settlement talks with Exxonlast year, now wants it to be clear that Exxon, not theagency, is seeking a plea bargain. Still, Mr. Thornburgh andhis aides would prefer the certainty of a bigmoney deal tothe risk of going to trial.   It remains uncertain what terms the Justice Departmentwould demand along with a guilty plea. One possiblearrangement would be for Exxon to agree to classify someportion of its monetary settlement as a criminal fine,thereby conceding a degree of criminal culpability. It isn'tknown whether the fine would be added to the total civilsettlement or would be drawn from that settlement.   Another sticking point in the settlement negotiationsmight be objections raised by Charles Hamel, a former oiltanker broker who has been fighting Exxon and other major oilcompanies with interests in Alaska. Their disputes focus onmutual business interests involving Mr. Hamel and the oilcompanies. In a letter to Mr. Thornburgh and EnvironmentalProtection Agency chief William Reilly, Mr. Hamel allegesthat Exxon has been dumping hazardous wastes into Alaska'sPrince William Sound. The letter says that the dumpingoccurred before and after the Exxon Valdez oil spill.   Mr. Hamel is calling for these allegations to be examinedin conjunction with the settlement negotiations.   California Rep. George Miller, who received a copy of theletter, appears to agree on a need to slow down the talks.Regarding Mr. Hamel's allegations, Mr. Miller said, &quot;I planto investigate these serious charges and expect the JusticeDepartment to do the same.&quot;   As acting chairman of the House Interior Committee, Mr.Miller has jurisdiction over Alaska lands, the Alaskanpipeline and offshore energy resources.   In his letter, Mr. Hamel specifically alleges that 50,000barrels, or 8,000 tons, of hazardous waste was loaded intothe ballast tanks of the supertanker Exxon Valdez on Aug. 4,1988. The waste was taken to Alaska where it was unloadedinto the ballast water treatment plant at Valdez. However,because the plant wasn't designed to handle such wastes, thetreated water was still contaminated when it was ejected backinto Valdez Harbor.   Mr. Hamel alleges that the Exxon Long Beach, sister shipto the now renamed Exxon Valdez, continued that practice atleast through last year. He claims that he has gatheredinformation on numerous violations from Exxon insiders whoare irate about the practice.   A spokesman for Exxon said the oil giant had no immediatecomment on Mr. Hamel's allegations.   &quot;Until Mr. Hamel offers evidence supporting his wastedumping claim, we have nothing to work from,&quot; said aspokeswoman for Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. which is ownedby seven oil companies, including Exxon.&quot;   ---   Paul M.
