The Nasdaq 100 index of the largest industrial issues climbed 4.69 points to 353.49, a gain of 1.3%. The Nasdaq industrial index of all nonfinancial stocks climbed 0.8% to 389.36, up 3.21 points, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 2.57 points to 377.84, a gain of 0.7%.    All of the OTC indexes outpaced the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rose 0.4%, or 8.79 points, to 2044.76.    Nasdaq's broad indexes often lag sharp moves in the Dow Jones Industrials by as much as a day because many small OTC stocks trade infrequently. But the 100 index of the biggest OTC stocks, which often keeps pace, failed to match the Dow's surge Monday. Yesterday, it caught up.    Leading the big OTC issues, which are heavily traded by institutional investors, were consumer products stocks such as Liz Claiborne, which climbed 1 to 15 3/4, and Cadbury Schweppes, the big British candy and soft drink maker, which rose 5 1/2 to 60 3/8. Cadbury shares reacted to a bid yesterday by Nestle SA for Rowntree PLC, another big British candy company. Cadbury and Rowntree dominate the British candy market.    Consumer service issues also were strong yesterday. Among telephone service issues, MCI Communications gained 5/8 to 13 1/2, and Pacific Telecom rose 1/4 to 13 3/4.    Yesterday's buying involved OTC stocks of all sizes. On the National Market System, where the largest and most active OTC issues trade, some 47 million shares rose in price and 28 million fell.    The smaller issues that don't trade on the NMS continued their even stronger performance. Some 7 million non-NMS shares rose while less than half that many, or 3 million, fell.    Among yesterday's non-NMS winners was Sports Entertainment Group, a small film packager and service firm for the sports industry, which climbed 37.5%, or 3/4, to 2 3/4. The new issue was first offered for trading on Nasdaq last Tuesday, but no shares changed hands. It was first quoted last week at 2 5/8 bid, 2 7/8 offered, then slipped to 2 bid, 3 offered. When Sports Entertainment finally traded in yesterday's bull market, its price jumped back into the initial offering range.    Many of the small new issues coming onto Nasdaq this year have had trouble in opening for trading. Traders say that's partly because underwriters and market makers have been less willing to support prices of small stocks since last October's crash. Most new small stocks start trading on Nasdaq as non-NMS issues.    Small OTC stocks, both on and off NMS, often move for reasons quite different from larger issues, analysts note. For example, some analysts pay more attention to small companies' revenue growth than to net income. As a result, shares of Convex Computer, a small maker of supercomputers, jumped 5/8 to 7 7/8 following its earnings report. Its net in the first quarter fell to 5 cents a share from 7 cents a share in the year-earlier period, but revenue jumped to $22 million from $14 million.    Midsized issues also fared well yesterday. Among the most active, Micom Systems jumped 2 5/8 to 16. The company said it has received takeover offers that it plans to pursue. As a result, Micom shelved its plans to buy back nine million shares for $16 each. </TEXT></DOC>
