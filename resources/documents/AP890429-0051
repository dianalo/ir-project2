About 20,000 riot police were deployed in Seoul to try toprevent Sunday's rally, which was called by militant labor groupsto push for workers' rights and denounce the government ofPresident Roh Tae-woo. The government has declared the rallyillegal.   About 2,000 radical students and workers gathered Saturday atYonsei University in eastern Seoul to prepare for the rally. Somehurled firebombs and rocks at riot police, who responded with teargas grenades.   In the southeastern port of Masan, about 2,000 strikers battledriot police in the third straight day of street clashes, accordingto Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.   Police officials, who refused to be named, said about 2,200workers and students were detained in Seoul to block Sunday's rally.   Labor and dissident groups vowed to go ahead with the rally,called to mark the May 1 international labor holiday. They claimedup to 100,000 workers would take part, and trade union leadersvowed the rally would be peaceful.   Students and workers at Yonsei rallied throughout the day,denouncing the Roh government and calling for creation of a newgovernment led by workers and peasants.   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Free labor rights!'' protestersyelled.   The two main opposition parties, the Party for Peace andDemocracy and the Reunification Democratic Party, urged thegovernment to let workers hold rallies.   The Reunification Democratic Party alleged that police had usedelectric cattle prods to torture arrested strike leaders anddemanded a full investigation. Police denied the charge anddemanded an apology from the party.   The government has warned that nationwide wave of strikes andlabor unrest are disrupting the economy and fomenting politicalunrest. Senior officials said Saturday the government was studyingtough new measures to end the strikes, but the official refused togive details.   The chairman of the governing Democratic Justice Party, ParkJyun-kyu, said the government may have to consider an emergencydecree giving Roh the power to take any necessary measures to endunrest.   ``If the problems are still not settled, declaration of apresidential emergency decree should be seriously considered,'' hesaid Friday.   Many South Korean workers receive subsistence wages for verylong workweeks. A growing number are demanding wage increases,better working conditions and a share in South Korea's growingeconomic prosperity.   The government says strikes have cost the country more than $3billion in lost production this year. It is concerned about effortsby radical students and dissidents to build a political alliancewith striking workers to challenge the Roh government.   Roh has introduced broad reforms since he took office inFebruary 1988, but dissidents associate him with the authoritarianregime of his predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan.   In addition to Roh's ouster, radicals are demanding thewithdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea under amutual defense pact. They say the troops prevent reunification withcommunist North Korea.</TEXT></DOC>
