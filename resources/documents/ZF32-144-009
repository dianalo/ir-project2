 It's the extras-agenerous library of bundled compact discs, software, and a three-yearwarranty that make it a great deal.andM;Along with DOS 4.0, Sun Moon Star pre-installs Windows 3.0, PC Tools Deluxe,and Checkit, a diagnostic and benchmark program similar to the Norton SystemIndex.andP;  And a veritable library of information awaits on the bundled CD-ROMdiscs.andP;  There, you'll find Microsoft Bookshelf (which includes the AmericanHeritage Dictionary, the World Almanac and Book of Facts, The Chicago Manualof Style, and Roget's Electronic Thesaurus), The Microsoft Stat Pack, TheMicrosoft Small Business Consultant, and Hotline 11 Executive (acommunications program that features a national directory of businessaddresses and telephone numbers and has autodial capability).andM;Entertainment and educational offerings include a disc of games from SoftwareToolworks, featuring PC chess, Bruce Lee Lives, and others; Grolier'sIllutstrated Encyclopedia; a world atlas; and a CD-ROM-based music guide thatplays musical selections.andP;  If you have children in elementary school, you'llappreciate the ability to call up maps, color portraits of historicalfigures, and sketches of plants and animals from these electronic &quot;pages.&quot;andM;Sun Moon Star's CD installation software, CD-setGo, makes it a snap to runthe CD software within Windows.andP;  It became even easier this spring, when thecompany began shipping the system with yet another ROM disc-one that featuresa 19-minute tutorial on how to get the most out of the programs the 386SX/CDputs at your disposal.andM;There are other things we would have liked to see in Sun Moon Star's bundle,however.andP;  Given the capabilities of Hotline II and the music guide, forexample, a modem and a set of headphones would have been helpful.andP;  But the386SX/ CD comes with neither-you'll have to buy your own.andM;The hardware itself is a 16Mhz 80386SX tower unit with two serial ports, aparallel port, a 40MB hard disk, 2MB of RAM (expandable to 8MB), a VGA videosubsystem, two open 16-bit slots, and one open 8-bit slot.andP;  The PC has onefloppy drive (1.2MB, 51/4-inch format) but, unfortunately, no 3 1/2-inchdrive and no good way to add one.andP;  There's space enough under the ROM driveto accommodate an extra drive, but there's no opening in the solid outer caseto make the installation feasible.andM;The system is capable, if unremarkable.andP;  The CPU performed a little under itsrated 16Mhz speed on the NortonPC/Computing System Index, but notunacceptably so.andP;  It clocked in at just over 15Mhz.andP;  And the hard diskreturned a seek time of 29 milliseconds.andP;  The 386SX/CD's VGA graphicsdelivered crisp, colorful screen images with no noticeable flicker.andP;  But ifthe system is fundamentally plain-Jane, the warranty isn't.andP;  Sun Moon Starwarrants the basic system for an impressive three year,s, offering freeonsite service during the first year.andP;  The CD player is warranted for 18months, which is 6 months longer than the manufacturer's warranty, and thehard disk is warranted for one year.andM;The chassis that contains the system could be more solid.andP;  Video controls areneatly hidden behind a door on the front panel, but the door doesn't snapfirmly shut.andP;  The keyboard has a tinny feel, and the bundled Genius serialmouse, though serviceable, lacks the sturdy, ergonomic design of itsMicrosoft and Logitech competitors.andP;  But at such an affordable list price, itmight be worthwhile simply to replace the keyboard and mouse with somethingmore attractive.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
