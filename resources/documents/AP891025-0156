Bruce Morrison, D-Conn.   The bill, which now goes to the Senate, would suspend for threeyears deportation of Chinese, Salvadorans and Nicaraguans whoregister within nine months.   It would stop short of granting political asylum or permanentresident status, but would provide temporary protection to perhaps750,000 exiles.   It also would establish a system for extending such temporarystatus to citizens of additional countries beset by armed conflictand natural disaster.   The measure is designed to furnish shelter to those who havefled civil war in Central America and face government persecutionas a result of the student democracy demonstrations in China.   Proponents said 70,000 Salvadorans and 30,000 Nicaraguancivilians have been killed in civil wars in their countries overthe last decade and that 10,000 participants in the Chinesedemocracy demonstrations have been jailed.   They scoffed at complaints that the measure would create anexception that would undermine existing immigration law.   Critics said it was a mistake to combine relief measures for theCentral Americans and the Chinese. They said the measure wouldmerely provide Central Americans hungry for American jobs with afoot in the door.   ``What we are going to do is grant a permanent status not topeople who came here for any political reason but for people whocame here for an economic reason to take jobs away from Americanworkers,'' said Rep. Bob Walker, R-Pa.   Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., a supporter of the measure, retortedthat the AFL-CIO and a number of large labor unions have endorsedthe measure. ``So evidently they aren't afraid,'' he told the House.   Rep. Helen Bentley, R-Md., cited estimates that the price tag onoperation of the measure could reach $260 million over two years.``I can tell you that my constituents will not abide by it,'' shedeclared.   Rep. Hamilton Fish, R-N.Y., said that illegal aliens who havefled the three countries already are in the United States. ``Ithink its in our interest to have Nicaraguans and Salvadoransliving in the open rather than maintaining an undergroundexistence,'' he said.   ``This bill is the right thing to do,'' Rep. Bill Richardson,D-N.M., told the House. He urged help for those ``uprooted forpolitical reasons, who have been escaping tragedy.''</TEXT></DOC>
