Flight engineer Benjamin Zimmermann said the hijackers beat himand passengers after the Athens to Rome flight was seized June 14,1985. He said he was kicked and pistol-whipped.   ``I would be hit on the side of the head with the gun butt. WhenI would bend forward the blows would go down my back,'' Zimmermanntestified.   The Arab hijackers forced the jetliner to fly to Beirut and held39 Americans hostage for 17 days. U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethemwas shot and killed during the ordeal. During the hijacking, thejet first flew to Beirut, then to Algeria, and then back to Beirut.   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is on trial on charges of airpiracy and murder.   Zimmermann, of Cascade, Idaho, said Hamadi proudly pointed toStethem's blood on the jet's fuselage as he and Hamadi walkedaround the plane when it landed in Algiers from Beirut.   ``When we went around the front, the nose of the airplane, Mr.Hamadi joyfully pointed to the blood running down the door. Andwith the pistol he pointed _ he indicated _ he was very proud ofthis gun and of him having caused this,'' Zimmermann testified.   ``He seemed to be demonstrating that he was capable of being aworthy soldier of the cause for some revolution,'' Zimmermann added.   Zimmermann did not describe the cause. However, Hamadi testifiedearlier in the trial his cause was ``the fight against Israel andits allies,'' including the United States. The hijackers haddemanded the release of Shiite Moslems held by Israel.   After the hijacking, Israel freed 700 Lebanese, mostly Moslems,from prison camps in Israel.   Under questioning from chief judge Reiner Mueckenberger,Zimmermann said he was ``absolutely'' certain about the events thatoccurred outside the plane.   The judge indicated Hamadi denied the incident took place.   Zimmermann said the flight crew tried to keep the plane inAlgiers for as long as possible. He said that as part of a stallingaction, he and Hamadi left the plane to inspect the engines.   ``Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything wrong with airplane,at least nothing noticeable to Mr. Hamadi,'' Zimmermann said.   Zimmermann said he was stunned by Hamadi's behavior as theyobserved the blood.   ``I wondered how he expected me to respond to him. It was as ifhe wanted congratulations. It seemed to be a great moment to him,what that blood represented to him,'' Zimmermann said.   He also described the events that led up to Stethem's shooting.   Zimmermann said that when negotiations for fuel with the towerin Beirut went too slowly, Hamadi shouted ``Get up! Get up!'' toStethem.   The flight engineer said both hijackers then left the cockpit.   ``I heard a pop. I heard someone exhale very loudly. I heard itabove the engine noises. The shock of that noise was added to bythe co-pilot on the radio stating that we needed fuel because theywere killing passengers,'' Zimmermann testified.   The TWA pilot, John Testrake, testified Monday that he believedHamadi shot Stethem because the defendant seemed to enjoy violence.The pilot said he did not see Hamadi pull the trigger and said bothhijackers may have been with Stethem when the American was killed.   Hamadi has admitted being one of the hijackers, but has deniedkilling Stethem.   Also today, Mueckenberger expressed relief that a West Germanbusinessman was released Monday after 20 months of captivity inLebanon.   ``I am extremely relieved that Mr. (Rudolf) Cordes has beenreleased,'' the judge said. ``This happy news means an end toendless speculation about what influence Cordes' captivity wouldhave on these proceedings.''   Mueckenberger said ``outside elements'' had never influenced thecourt, adding: ``It is not the job of the court to conductdiplomacy.''   Cordes and another West German, Alfred Schmidt, were kidnappedin Beirut in January 1987 in the week after Hamadi was arrested atFrankfurt Airport with explosives in his luggage.   Hamad's older brother, Abbas Hamadi, was convicted by aDuesseldorf court of helping kidnap Schmidt and Cordes in a bid tofree his brother.   Schmidt was released Sept. 7, 1987 in what his kidnappers saidwas a ``good will gesture.''   In Beirut, Cordes' pro-Iranian captors said his release waslinked to Mohammed Hamadi. In a statement, the captors said that ifHamadi's release cannot be gained legally, ``then we shall beobliged to again resort to violence.''</TEXT></DOC>
