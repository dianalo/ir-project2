The action solves Lotus's biggest long-term problem --being a one-product company. Since Novell has more than halfthe market for network software, the combined company islikely to play a big technological role as other softwarecompanies design their programs to work in the networks ofpersonal computers that are spreading through offices. And iftheir marketing arms can sell each other's products, theywill get the attention of many customers.</LP><TEXT>   Analysts said that if the two companies successfully mergetheir strengths and offset their weaknesses, they may providea counterweight to the industry dominance of Microsoft Inc.,Redmond, Wash., which competes with both Lotus and Novell.   &quot;The merger rearranges the power structure of the softwareindustry,&quot; said Aaron Goldberg, a market researcher withInternational Data Corp., Framingham, Mass. Combined, the twocompanies' sales are expected to top $1.2 billion this year;analysts expect Microsoft to have $1.1 billion in revenue inits fiscal year ending June 30.   Lotus agreed to acquire Novell for 41.6 million shares ofstock with a market value of about $1.5 billion. It would bethe third-biggest computer industry merger ever afterBurroughs Corp.'s merger with Sperry Corp. to form UnisysInc. and General Motors Corp.'s $2.5 billion acquisition ofElectronic Data Systems Inc.   Lotus was once the industry leader because of the successof its best-selling 1-2-3 spreadsheet. But its failure tocome up with other hits has enabled Microsoft, which has comeout with a slew of popular products, to surpass it.   Timothy McCollum, a software analyst with Dean Witter,said, &quot;This is a very good growth area for Lotus to getinto.&quot;   Networking personal computers together is a boomingbusiness because personal computers are becoming powerfulenough to do the jobs of minicomputers and even mainframes incorporate and government offices.   However, Mr. McCollum cautioned that merging the twocompanies may prove difficult. John McCarthy, an analyst withForrester Research, Cambridge, Mass., predicted corporateculture shock when the &quot;MBA yuppies from Lotus go out toProvo.&quot;   Both companies have been sharp stock gainers in the pastmonth as technology stocks came into favor. But on Friday,investors -- worried that the merger may prove difficult, anddisappointed that Novell holders won't get a premium --showed their displeasure. In over-the-counter trading, Lotusstock fell $2 to $34.25. Novell stock fell $4.125 to $38.75.   The two companies described the combination as a merger ofequals. Lotus will exchange stock equal to the average valueof Novell stock in the past 10 days. It said it will swap1.19131 Lotus shares for each Novell share. After the merger,Novell holders will own about 48% of the combined company.   Lotus's Jim P. Manzi will remain chairman, president andchief executive officer of the combined company. RaymondNoorda, Novell's chairman, will become vice chairman andchief executive of the Novell subsidiary.   One factor that helped make the agreement possible wasthat Mr. Noorda is 66 years old, and doesn't have a clearsuccessor. Mr. Noorda said he doesn't have any plans toretire, but acknowledged that the lack of a second in command&quot;leads to some insecurity among investors.&quot;   Both companies are highly profitable, fast-growingsoftware concerns. Last year Lotus reported net income of $68million, or $1.61 a share, on sales of $556 million. Saleshad been hampered last year until Lotus finally startedshipping updated versions of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet during thesummer. This year most analysts expect strong growth.   Novell reported net income of $48.5 million, or $1.46 ashare, on revenue of $421.9 million for its fiscal year endedOct. 28. Novell has about 52% of the market for software thatlets networks of personal computers share printers,information and programs.   If the merger works as planned, the two companies willcomplement each other. &quot;Our view is this is a powerfulcombination. Sales and marketing are very complementary,&quot;said Mr. Manzi. Lotus expects to sell its network software,including a new program called Notes, through the resellerswho handle Novell networks. Novell expects Lotus'ssalespeople, who deal with big corporations, will help it getits Netware into more offices.   In terms of technology, Mr. Manzi said Lotus is making itsapplications easy to use in networks where users shareinformation, rather than only in individual PCs. With Lotus'sbacking for Novell, other software vendors may design theirprograms to work well with Novell's Netware rather thanemphasizing Microsoft's competing LAN Manager.   The combined companies may resemble the structure ofMicrosoft, analysts said. Microsoft sells both softwareapplications, such as its Excel spreadsheet, and operatingsystems that control the inner workings of computers andnetworks. Now Lotus will sell applications software such asits 1-2-3 spreadsheet, and operating systems for networks.</TEXT></DOC>
