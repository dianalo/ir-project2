The director would rather have audiences make up their ownminds.   ``I hope there's plenty of irony in all my films. That's the verything I look for,'' said the British director of ``MidnightCowboy,'' ``Marathon Man'' and other acclaimed movies.   ``It could all be disaster, but it isn't. That's kind of myattitude to life. Most of the endings I've had, there is a questionmark. They're often about people determined to carry on.''   ``Madame Sousatzka,'' based on the novel by Bernice Rubens, takesplace in London and stars Shirley MacLaine as a demanding, emotionalpiano teacher whose philosophy, ``I teach how to live,'' is thecause of much conflict with her students.   Schlesinger originally sought a European actress to play theRussian-born teacher, but wanted MacLaine after deciding to cast anAmerican.   ``I liked the fact that she was willing to take risks,'' he said.``I thought she brought quite a lot to `Terms of Endearment,'looking dreadful. She's not worried about her Shirley MacLaineimage. I got to know that very fast.''   Schlesinger credits MacLaine, whose work in ``Terms ofEndearment'' earned her an Academy Award for best actress in 1985,with making the eccentric Sousatzka believeable.   ``Sometimes when I worked on the script, I'd say, `Oh god, she'stoo monstrous.' But she had a way of playing the eccentricities sothat it was totally part of her,'' the director said. ``She doesn'tplay to the audience at all. I think it's a most extraordinaryperformance.''   For the part of Manek Sen, the 15-year-old prodigy who enduresSousatzska's violent mood swings, Schlesinger auditioned hundreds ofactors before choosing newcomer Navin Chowdhry, who makes his filmdebut in the movie. Chowdhry had no musical training, butSchlesinger nevertheless found him perfect for the part. Theyoungster worked with musical advisor Yonty Solomon.   In a way, Irina Sousatzka can be likened to Nora Desmond, theaging actress in ``Sunset Boulevard.'' Both are flamboyant on thesurface and lonely underneath. Desmond falls in love with a youngscreenwriter, Sousatskza with Manek.   ``It's a love story. She's created something and now she falls inlove with him,'' Schlesinger noted.   ``She's a survivor. Even if she's angry or upset. I believe itisn't so removed from people even if the subject is about music.It's all about perfectly common human experience.''   The 62-year-old Schlesinger's own musical background attractedhim to the story. His father was a cellist, his mother a violinist,and Schlesinger himself was an accomplished pianist as a child.   Schlesinger was a character actor in the 1950s, appearing onstage, in television and films. He also made documentary shorts. Hisfirst commercial film, ``Terminus,'' won the Golden Lion for bestdocumentary at the 1961 Venice Film Festival.   ``A Kind of Loving,'' his first feature film, was released thefollowing year. Starring a then unknown Alan Bates, the film won theGolden Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival and establishedSchlesinger as one of England's most talented young directors.   He then directed ``Billy Liar'' and ``Darling,'' which earnedJulie Christie the best actress Oscar in 1965. ``Midnight Cowboy,''his first film made in Hollywood, earned Academy Awards for bestpicture, director and best adapted screenplay in 1969.   With Jon Voight as a Texan hustler and Dustin Hoffman as atubercular Bronx con man, ``Midnight Cowboy'' typified Schlesinger'sfascination with characters who are ``up against it.''   Schlesinger sees that theme running strongly in ``MadameSousatzka.''   ``In the case of Manek, he's up against the promise of successand the possibility of failure which she has been up against,'' hesaid. ``She's up against her past. She's up against it in many ways.It makes her behave a certain way.   ``They're all up against something. Changing London, changingvalues.''   Schlesinger has also directed Glenda Jackson in ``Sunday, BloodySunday'' and Hoffman and Sir Laurence Olivier in ``Marathon Man.''   ``Enthusiasm,'' the director says, is what he looks for from hisactors. MacLaine, he said, loved the role. ``She ... didn't careabout the money, was charming to everyone, particularly the boy. Thefact that's she's out banging the drum about the movie proves she'senthusiastic.''   And so is Schlesinger. He's merged his great loves, film andmusic, and feels the movie expresses certain things he feels.   ``It's communicating,'' he said. ``You're trying to invoke anemotional response to something, to make them laugh or make themangry as well as just telling a story.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed AMs, Nov. 2</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
