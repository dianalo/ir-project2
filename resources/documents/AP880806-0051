The television said the seizure would either totally prevent orseriously disrupt the planned independence initiative, and itbroadcast what it said were portions of it.   The broadcast came one hour after U.S. envoy Richard Murphyarrived for talks with Israeli leaders. The talks will focus onJordan's cutting of ties with the occupied territorites and theimpact on a U.S. plan that hinged on Jordanian representation ofPalestinians in Middle East peace talks.   State-run television said the independence document was in worksbefore Jordan's King Hussein announced last week his intention topull back from the occupied territories and hand overresponsibility to the Palestine Liberation Organization.   The report said a draft version was seized by the Israelisecurity forces during a search at the east Jerusalem Arab StudiesInstitute immediately after the institute's leader, FeisalHusseini, was detained on Aug. 1. Husseini is viewed by Israeliofficials as a leading PLO figure.   It was the first time that the seizure of the draft declarationwas announced and its contents revealed.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's office issued a statement whichsaid the document was filled with ``insane and dangerous dreamsthat will not come true.''   Some Palestinians suggested the document was leaked to justifyHusseini's arrest, which was protested by the United States, IsraelRadio reported.   The television said that the paper, called ``A declaration ofPalestinian independence document,'' included names of dozens ofPalestinians who were to become members of a ``local Parliament.''   It was not immediately clear whether Palestinians whose namesappear on the list would be arrested.   It said the document called for a Palestinian state headed byPLO chairman Yasser Arafat, with PLO executive Farouk Kaddoumi ashis foreign minister and heads of other PLO factions as ministers.   The state would include the occupied West Bank and Gaza Stripand some land inside Israel, according to the report. Israel seizedthe West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt in the 1967Middle East War.   However, Palestinians who composed the document also called forrecognition of Israel's right to exist and peace talks based on theclarification of future border lines, linkage between the West Bankand Gaza and future ties with Israel, the television said.   It said the document's authors wanted ``to push Israel to thewall'' by issuing the declaration and continuing violent protests,while giving their state a chance of being recognized by supportiveArab nations.   They also stressed the need to receive a Soviet blessing, thetelevision said.   Meanwhile, hundreds of Palestinians holding Jordanian passportsstreamed across Jordan River bridges into Jordan to express concernover their future and King Hussein's decisions to sever links withPalestinians in the occupied lands.   Hussein canceled a $1.3 billion development plan for the WestBank, dissolved the lower house of Parliament and announced thedismissal of 21,200 Palestinian employees working for Jordanianinstitutions in the West Bank and Gaza.   On Saturday, he abolished the ministry for Israeli-occupiedterritories and put the Foreign Ministry in charge of itsfunctions. The move signaled the kingdom's view that relations withthe territories were now a foreign, not a domestic, issue.   ``King Hussein might close the bridges, and if he does, it willbe my last visit to Jordan,'' said Amman-born Salwa Abu Kaf, 27.   Arab sources said most of the Palestinians traveling to Jordanwere concerned about their ties with relatives living in thekingdom, children employed in the gulf states or economic linkswith Jordan.   Several Palestinians said they planned to seek residence inJordan so that their families would not be separated.   In Amman, a government official, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said Saturday his government would keep those bridgesopen and continue to honor Jordanian passports held by residents ofthe occupied territories.   Shamir's spokesman Yossi Ahimeir said Jordan's decision todismantle the occupied territories ministry was ``yet anotherartificial step to separate Palestinian Arabs'' living on the Eastand West Bank.   Protests erupted Saturday in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,where underground Palestinian leaders called on followers to``greet Murphy with demonstrations and clashes'' with troops.   Murphy did not speak to reporters after his arrival. He is dueto meet Sunday with Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.   Troops wounded three Arabs hours before Murphy's arrival, and a15-year-old boy died after being shot Friday, Arab reports, thearmy and Israel Radio said.   The death raised to 237 the number of Palestinian victims in theuprising, which began Dec. 8. Four Israelis also have died.</TEXT></DOC>
