The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a small, one-year pilot program in cross-margining by professional securities and futures trading firms aimed at freeing up more of their capital for market-making purposes. More importantly, the approval is expected to speed regulatory passage shortly for a much larger cross-margining pilot involving the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which accounts for more than 75% of all stock-index futures trading.    Cross-margining was recommended in most studies of last year's market crash as a means of providing more liquidity to the financial markets. The markets teetered on the verge of collapse on Oct. 20 last year, the day after Black Monday's record stock market plunge, partly because so many securities firms had millions of dollars locked up in margin positions.    The firms were unable to use these funds to trade, even though many margined positions in stock-index futures and options, for example, offset each other and actually reduced the firms' risk.    The pilot program approved by the SEC involves the Options Clearing Corp., which processes all securities options trades in the U.S., and the Intermarket Clearing Corp., which processes futures trades for several smaller futures markets. ICC members include the New York Futures Exchange, an affiliate of the New York Stock Exchange, the Philadelphia Board of Trade, a unit of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, and Amex Commodities Corp., an American Stock Exchange affiliate.    The ICC-Options Clearing Corp. pilot was approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on June 1. </TEXT></DOC>
