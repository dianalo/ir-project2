At other sites the supply of larvae is limiting,and events in the offshore waters, such as wind-driven upwelling, explainthe composition of intertidal communities. Whether the community ecologyat a site is governed by adult-adult interactions within the site, orby limitations to the supply of larvae reaching the site, is determinedby the regional pattern of circulation in the coastal waters. Modelscombining larval circulation with adult interactions can potentiallyforecast population fluctuations. These findings illustrate how processesin different ecological habitats are coupled.</TEXT></DOC>
