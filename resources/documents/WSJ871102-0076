U.S. trade officials said the cabinet-level Economic Policy Council could act as early as this week on a unanimous interagency recommendation to penalize Brazil for imposing unreasonable restraints on imports of U.S. computer software. The sanctions could subject a number of Brazilian products, including shoes, textiles and airplanes, to a total of between $50 million and $100 million in additional tariffs.    The council has sat on that recommendation for two weeks to avoid souring sensitive negotiations on Brazilian debt, but U.S. officials now are convinced that the debt and trade issues should be handled separately. If the council's chairman, Treasury Secretary James Baker, concurs, the U.S. would follow the recommendation to retaliate against Brazil for its controversial policy of excluding foreign companies from important sectors of its information market.    The unanimous vote by the Trade Policy Review Group, a middle-level interagency panel, was precipitated by Brazil's rejection earlier this month of an application by six domestic companies to import Microsoft Corp.'s software. The Brazilian ruling effectively violated a commitment to work out disputes over this policy through bilateral discussions.    Brazil made that pledge last May as the price for the partial withdrawal of a U.S. complaint against its policy on information industries. However, the Special Secretariat for Informatics, or SEI, the Brazilian agency overseeing the policy, denied the license without giving the U.S. advance notice.    &quot;We were simply presented with a fait accompli,&quot; a disappointed U.S. negotiator said.    SEI's action sent an even more disturbing message: President Jose Sarney and his professional diplomats who had reached the original accord with the U.S. are losing control over this emotional issue to the economic nationalists. U.S. trade officials are convinced that only blunt retaliation can shock Brazil into listening.    The May accord conceded Brazil's right to use &quot;reasonable&quot; means to stake out market shares for its microcomputer and software producers. But U.S. complaints about patent and copyright violations continue. Apple Computer Inc., for one, charges that its Apple II and Macintosh models are being copied in Brazil by as many as 20 Apple lookalikes.    &quot;They even use our apple logos, with or without the bite,&quot; complained James Johnson, Apple's government-affairs director. &quot;Even the operating manuals are ours, except for the Portuguese words.&quot;    Apple worries further that another Brazilian company, Unitron S.A., is waiting for a license from SEI to market a Macintosh 512 clone.    While the Brazilian informatics law effectively bars Apple from that market until 1992, it's silent on software. The Brazilian parliament is trying to fill that statutory void with a software bill that from the U.S. perspective has both good and bad provisions.    In any event, the U.S. charges that SEI stretched the law to protect a Brazilian software maker whose product allegedly is only a poor copy of Microsoft's widely used MS-DOS system.    International Business Machines Corp. has ducked the fight because the informatics policy doesn't affect its still-thriving business in mainframe computers. But an increasing number of U.S. high-technology producers are demanding retaliation.    &quot;It was a mistake to withdraw the complaint to begin with,&quot; asserted Edward Black, vice president of the Washington-based Computer and Communications Industry Association. &quot;We are insistent that strong action be taken to open that market.&quot;    The Brazilian government insists that SEI is acting within its legal authority. &quot;If U.S. companies have any complaints against SEI, they can go to Brazilian courts or appeal the decisions through the proper administrative channels,&quot; said Mauricio Cortes Costa, Brazil's economic counselor in Washington.    But both Apple and Microsoft contend that litigation in Brazil is just a waste of time and money. </TEXT></DOC>
