Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is being tried on murder andair piracy charges in the 1985 jetliner hijacking. He has admittedhijacking the Athens to Rome flight with an accompllice anddiverting it to Beirut, Lebanon.   But Hamadi has denied killing U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethemduring the ordeal in which 39 Americans were held hostage for 17days.   Describing the circumstances of Stethem's shooting, the co-pilot,46-year-old Philip G. Maresca, told the court: ``I was able to peekout of the corner of my eye and I thought I was able to determinethat a passenger ... was being dragged to the front of the plane.''   ``Then I heard a gunshot. A short time later, about 10 to 15seconds later, Hamadi came into the cockpit with a gun in his hand.   ``Then Uli Direckson (the flight purser) came in very distressedand said one of the passengers had been killed,'' Maresca said,fighting back tears as he described the scene.   The diver's parents, Richard and Patricia Stethem, listenedquietly during the testimony. The elder Stethem took notes as he hasdone regularly since the trial began on July 5.   Hamadi sat nearly motionless listening to an Arabic-languageinterpreter translate Maresca's testimony. Other witnesses havetestified they believed Hamadi killed Steham, but no one has saidthey saw him do it.   Outside the high-security courtroom, scores of police, somecarrying machine guns, patrolled the area.   During his testimony, Maresca said he did not see the shooting``because Hamadi said look forward and not behind and not to payattention to any noise.''   Maresca also described how the hijackers beat the crew every timethey tried to establish radio contact with other aircraft orairports in the area.   Maresca said he felt Hamadi was the leader of the two hijackers.U.S. officials have identified the other as Hassan Ezzeddine,another Lebanese Shiite Moslem.   ``Hamadi appeared to me, and it was a very strong impression,that he was the leader. He spoke on the radio. He grabbed themicrophone most of the time. He did most of the beatings'' of thecrew,'' Maresca said.   ``He was more volatile, very excitable. The other hijacker triedto restrain Hamadi when he was extremely abusive. Hamadi had the gunmost of the time and he made most of the demands on us,'' Marescasaid.   In keeping with court policy on security for former hijackinghostages, Maresca was not asked to give his current address.   Before Maresca's testimony, Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenbergeraccepted a defense motion made last week that Hamadi be given apsychiatric examination. The defense claims Hamadi was mentallydisturbed at the time of the hijacking.   The judge said Hamadi would undergo three days of phsychiatrictests soon.   Hamadi was arrested Jan. 13, 1987 at Frankfurt airport aftercustoms officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.</TEXT></DOC>
