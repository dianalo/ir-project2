Soviet pilots flew flamboyant aerobatic routines in jet fightersnever before seen in the West that wowed the crowds. On the ground,industry professionals were just as impressed with the Soviets'capitalist fervor.   ``This air show has made me aware that they intend toaggressively seek foreign currency through the sale of theiraircraft to the West,'' said James Roberts, deputy undersecretary ofstate for aviation in the U.S. Department of Commerce.   ``I never before considered them a competitive threat. Now Ido,'' said Roberts, who attended the 10-day show which closes Sunday.   The Soviets even managed to turn the crash of the MiG-29 on theshow's opening day to their advantage. The pilot, Anatoly Kvochur,became the hero of the day and the seat that allowed him to ejectsafely captured industry attention as the technology of the hour.   At the world's greatest aviation show-and-sell, the Sovietsimpressed visitors with the range and sophistication of their 12aircraft on display, including two new airliners, the latest jetfighters and the massive AN-225 transport carrying the shuttle Buran.   ``Clearly the Soviet aircraft industry has made enormousstrides,'' said Ian Woodward, a spokesman for British Aerospacecommercial planes. ``They've been behind but they're catching upfast.''   A team of seven Soviet salesmen employed by Aviaexport, theSoviet marketing arm, worked nonstop throughout the long hotafternoons.   Moscow's Central Institute of Aviation Motors offered air showparticipants its research services.   Soviet aircraft components were on display in the U.S.S.R.Pavilion, the Soviet space agency Glavkosmos peddled its launchservices and design engineers for nearly every Soviet planedisplayed were on hand to answer questions.   Anatoly Bulanenko, deputy chief designer for the Antonov DesignBureau, told reporters that permission had been granted for theAN-225 to be leased or chartered to foreign clients to carrycommercial freight. The plane, which can haul up to 250 tons, willcarry space rockets for the European Space Agency next fall.   Bulanenko acknowledged that political difficulties may arise inarranging deals, but said ``business should come first.''   Many industry observers predicted the Soviets will experiencesome turbulence in seeking to put their planes in Western skies.   ``They will need to convince customers that the airplanes arereliable, have good (after-sale) support and low maintenancecosts,'' said John Hayhurst, a marketing executive for Boeing Co.,the largest U.S. civil aircraft maker.   Boeing's 747 would be the chief competitor for the new Sovietjetliner Tupelov 204 now being tested. Other Soviet planes,including the new Ilyushin-96-300, would face establishedcompetition from McDonnell Douglas of St. Louis, Mo., and AirbusIndustrie, the European consortium.   Edward Sluchevsky, head of Aviaexport transport sales, said histeam of late-blooming capitalists ``are not beginners, we havetraditions, we have a reputation in the limited market we haveserved.''   ``Furthermore, we are ready to include in our contracts the sameproduct support, the same guarantees of reliability as our Westerncompetitors,'' he said in an interview at the Soviet chalet where aconstant stream of curious pilots, engineers and others came to call.   For customers, the biggest question may be the quality of Sovietengines, reputedly inefficient and requiring frequent maintenance.The Soviets say they can resolve the problems and even have offeredto install Western-made engines in their planes.   In the military market, the Soviets will be vying for a piece ofa shrinking pie. Cuts in defense spending have put the crunch oneven well-established arms makers.   Soviet officials said they hope to increase total export salesfrom the $2.27 billion projected for 1989 to about $3 billion by1995.   U.S. aerospace exports projected for 1989 are $27.8 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
