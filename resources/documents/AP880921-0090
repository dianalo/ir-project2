Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed African National Congress leaderNelson Mandela, commented after visiting the three men at theconsulate in a Johannesburg office building.   She said U.S. officials in Washington were refusing to let thethree communicate directly with the news media, a condition whichthey initially agreed to but now want to change. ``We would like tosee the Americans a little more committed than they are,'' she said.   A U.S. Embassy spokesman, Barry Walkley, said his government wasconcerned with the well-being of the activists ``and at the sametime with maintaining the appropriate posture of a diplomaticmission.''   ``Establishing a media forum is incompatable with either theconcept of temporary refuge or the functioning of a diplomaticmission,'' he said.   ``We agreed that they can convey messages through their legalrepresentatives. However, using their legal representatives asintermediaries for interviews goes beyond that agreement.''   Elsewhere, 11 activists reportedly were detained understate-of-emergency regulations in Cape Town, where a nationalanti-apartheid conference is planned this weekend. In the port cityof Durban, police said 160 people were arrested after hundreds ofstriking black dockworkers went on strike.   Encamped at the U.S. Consulate are two leaders of the bannedUnited Democratic Front _ Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa _and the chairman of the banned National Education Crisis Committee,Vusi Khanyile. They slipped away from guards Sept. 13 at aJohannesburg hospital.   They have remained at the consulate despite a government promisethat they will not be arrested or restricted if they leave, andhave called for the release of all political detainees.   Mrs. Mandela said the three are wary because of a threat bySouth African authorities immediately after their escape. She saidthe government said it would take ``the most severe measures''against the men unless they agreed to leave the country.   Lawyer Essa Moosa said activists taken away from their homestoday included Trevor Manuel, 32, Cape Town leader of the UnitedDemocratic Front. Manuel was detained without charge in August 1986and was placed under severe restrictions when released in July.   The detained activists reportedly included at least two whites,an Indian, several blacks and people of mixed-race.   Police declined to confirm the detentions, but did report on theDurban dock strike. According to police, the arrests in Durban cameafter strikers, many of them carrying sticks and pipes, staged anillegal gathering.   The strike began Tuesday to protest the dismissal of a workerand to demand higher pay.   Initial reports from lawyers and relatives indicated nineactivists were detained in Cape Town. But Frank Meintjies of theCongress of South African Trade Unions said 11 United DemocraticFront activists were detained.   The anti-apartheid conference is to be held Saturday and Sundayat the University of Cape Town and is sponsored by the Congress ofSouth African Trade Unions, the country's largest labor federation.   Organizers are seeking to bring together about 75 oppositiongroups, ranging from white, liberal Parliament members toorganizations that advocate black self-reliance.   ``This is not a conference of people who necessarily agree oneverything,'' Meintjies said. ``But they all agree that theapartheid problem should be done away with once and for all.''Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote innational affairs, which are controlled by the 5 million whites.   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrictreporting about security force actions and treatment of detainees,but enforcement of the rules has not been comprehensive.</TEXT></DOC>
