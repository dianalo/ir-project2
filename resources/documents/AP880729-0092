Burmese returning from worship at the gold-laden ShwedagonPagoda said a small number of students stood atop water tanks atthe shrine Thursday evening, gave anti-government speeches andshouted slogans.   The students returned before noon today, but there were noreports of violence or confrontation with authorities.   Some commotion erupted on the crowded pagoda grounds Thursdaywhen pilgrims dispersed in panic following a fight between someyouths. No injuries were reported.   The Shwedagon Pagoda, in the northern suburbs of Rangoon, hasbeen a traditional gathering place for political dissenters,including those who fought British colonialism.   Last month, authorities surrounded and briefly closed the pagodaafter students set up a ``strike center'' designed to coordinateanti-government protest. The students entered the pagoda precinctsfollowing a week of rioting in Rangoon. Official accounts said ninepeople died in the rioting.   Following the June unrest which spread to other Burmese citiesand towns, the government closed virtually all universities. Theyare scheduled to reopen next month.   Students also have been spreading leaflets in the Burmesecapital denouncing Sein Lwin, who was elected both president andchairman of the ruling political party. He succeeded Ne Win, whowielded power for 26 years.   According to Western and Burmese sources, Sein Lwin commandedriot police who brutally put down student demonstrations here lastMarch. With a long record of harsh action against dissenters, SeinLwin's elevation to the country's most powerful positions is likelyto spark more unrest.   Since October, violent, student-led demonstrations have eruptedthree times. In addition to demands for greater freedom within themilitary-controlled state, protesters are demanding better economicconditions in this once prosperous country.   Western diplomats are watching how students will act afterclasses resume. On Saturday, Ne Win warned that if the army iscalled out to suppress protets it would shoot ``to hit'' ratherthan just scare.   The small, Shwedagon demonstration was the first known publicprotest in Rangoon since the leadership changes.   A curfew remained in effect in the town of Myede, 220 milesnorth of Rangoon, after mobs destroyed buildings and clashed withpolice Tuesday. Officials said one person was killed and fivewounded.   It was not clear whether that unrest was politically related. Itappeared to have been sparked by strife between Moslems andBuddhists, who are the majority in Burma.   A number of outbursts in recent months started as minor personalor ethnic quarrels and escalated into anti-government riots.</TEXT></DOC>
