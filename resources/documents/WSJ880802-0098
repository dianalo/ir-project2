The Chinese army, led by &quot;cadres&quot; instead of officers, fared badly in clashes with the Vietnamese some years back. China's new leaders, who have demobilized about one million members of their one-time four-million-member army, had sacked some 450,000 &quot;cadres&quot; before the latest move reinstating officers and ranks. This suggests that the army had become overburdened with chiefs. Egalitarianism, among its other problems, apparently is no protection against bureaucracy. </TEXT></DOC>
