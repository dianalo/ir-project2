About 5,000 barrels a day of Vietnam's Bach Ho, or &quot;White Tiger,&quot; crude are currently being pumped at a field, off Vietnam's southern coast, that is controlled jointly by Vietnamese and Soviet state oil companies, the sources said.    Two cargoes of between 150,000 and 200,000 barrels apiece, each less than half the size of shipments normally traded in international markets, are scheduled to be exported during the next month. The oil's quality is roughly similar to Indonesia's medium-weight, low-sulfur Cinta and Sumatra light grades, which are officially priced at $17.10 and $17.56 a barrel.    The marketing of the crude could lead to sales of oil-field gear, pipe and refinery equipment to Vietnam during the next two to three years as the country develops the Bach Ho field and neighboring oil fields.    At least two Japanese companies, C. Itoh andamp; Co. and Nissho Iwai Corp., are involved in what an official at one of the companies described as &quot;complex&quot; negotiations over an oil-for-equipment trade.    Two oil companies, Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine of France and the Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch/Shell Group, are said to be talking with Vietnamese and Soviet officials about refining the crude in Singapore and then selling back to Vietnam some of the resulting petroleum products. </TEXT></DOC>
