(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Woodworth mayor and his second cousinare back in court, fighting this time over the cousin allegedlyselling watermelons without a license.   Mayor David Butler brought Charlie Butler into state districtcourt Monday over a roadside watermelon stand Charlie Butler set upwithout paying an occupational tax to the village.   Charlie Butler's lawyer suggested the ordinance was illegal.   Ninth Judicial District Judge Richard Lee took the matter underadvisement.   The Butlers first appeared in court several months ago whenCharlie Butler was accused of driving Woodworth's fire truckwithout authorization.
