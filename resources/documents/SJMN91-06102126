Chevron and 17 partners have invested $2.5billion in it but have never been able to tap any of the oil because of thecontinuing fight over how to transport it.;    Santa Barbara County and localenvironmentalists have strenuously opposed Chevron's plan to use tankers,citing the possibility of a catastrophic spill like one that fouled areabeaches in 1969.;    In other action this week, the coastal commission voted6-5 to allow the Air Force to fire nine missiles carrying mildly radioactivepayloads into the Pacific Ocean.;    The missiles will be launched from a B-2bomber flying at least 25 miles off the coast and are expected to land aboutfive miles north of San Nicolas Island, about 100 miles west of Los Angeles.;   The military says it must use spent, mildly radioactive uranium so the testpayload will match the weight of an actual warhead.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Los Angeles  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910411  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  249  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday April 11, 199100102126,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
