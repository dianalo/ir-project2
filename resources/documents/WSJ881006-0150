U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and James M. Fox, assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation office here, said the indictments are part of a continuing effort by their offices and the city's banking community to identify and prosecute lower-level employees of federally insured banking institutions who commit bank fraud and embezzle funds.    The indictments all were returned last week. Each individual faces prison terms of as much as five years and fines ranging from $5,000 to $250,000. The defendants, indicted for attempted or actual embezzlement of sums ranging from $2,000 to $70,000, are scheduled to be arraigned on the charges today.    The 24 individuals charged include a wide range of officers and employees, including branch managers, assistant managers, customer-service representatives, tellers, and accounting and clerical employees. </TEXT></DOC>
