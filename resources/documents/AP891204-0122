Bush, who spent the weekend in summit talks with Mikhail S.Gorbachev, emerged from a meeting with NATO leaders to praise theSoviet leader's handling of the changes throughout the EasternBloc. He it ``absolutely mandates new thinking'' on the part ofWestern leaders.   At the same time, Bush wouldn't go along with Gorbachev'spost-summit declaration on Sunday that the world was leaving the``epoch of the Cold War.''   Said Bush: ``If I signal to you there's no Cold War then they'llsay, `Well, what are you doing with troops in Europe?'''   Bush's meeting with NATO leaders was private. But Dutch ForeignMinister Hans van den Broek told reporters the president said thesuperpower leaders agreed in Malta to aim for an East-West summitin Vienna next summer to sign a landmark treaty reducingconventional forces in Europe.   ``Let's get it done,'' the president said at his newsconference. He said he wanted the accord ``in the bank'' beforemoving on to more complicated matters.   Bush and the allied leaders met as Gorbachev was convening ameeting of a radically reordered Warsaw Pact in Moscow.   The president was in good humor as he neared the end of hissummit journey. He laughed off a reporter's suggestion that he hadbeen at risk during bad weather in Malta when he boarded a smallboat for a brief trip through rough seas to return to a warshipanchored offshore.   ``These charismatic, visionary, macho guys, they'll doanything,'' he said to laughter.   Bush was flying home shortly after his news conference.   The 16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact nations are negotiating inVienna on cuts in conventional forces in Europe. Van den Broekquoted Bush as saying he hoped an accord could be reached aboutmid-1990.   Conventional forces aside, the superpowers are negotiating atreaty to cut long-range nuclear weapons by up to 50 percent, and aseparate agreement on banning chemical weapons.   On the subject of trade, Bush signaled his intention anew tohelp the battered Soviet economy. But when asked whether Gorbachevwould be invited to next year's economic summit of industrialdemocracies, he replied, ``two chances _ slim and none _ for thatparticular meeting. Nor did he request to be included in thatparticular meeting,'' he said.   Bush said that while ``all was not sweetness and light'' at theMalta summit, even as he applauded Gorbachev's handling of thechange in Eastern Europe.   Asked what had emerged at the summit, he said ``I think he tookmy measure and I took his and I think we both feel more comfortableabout our common objectives.''   He said Gorbachev was ``determined and unemotional '' in theirprivate talks. The Soviet leader ``seemed very much in control''and ``very confident in discussing without notes a wide array ofsubjects with me.''   The conventional arms talks are designed to reduce U.S. troopsin Europe by 30,000 and Soviet troops by 325,000 to a level ofabout 275,000 on each side. The negotiations also are attempting tocontrol tanks and other weapons.   ``The importance of this is that it indicates both (Bush andGorbachev) want to make an effort to reach such an agreement nextyear,'' Van den Broek said.   ``In that context, the term mid-1990 was mentioned. Without adoubt, that should be regarded as positive,'' he said.   Bush was asked whether the improvement in East-West relationscould free money for domestic programs such as education and thehomeless. ``I think it is premature to speak as some are at homeabout a peace dividend,'' he said.   Bush noted large federal deficits and said there isn't ``excessmoney'' available.   The president began his news conference with a statement thatsaid a ``peaceful revolution'' was taking place in Eastern Europe,where five hardline communist regimes have fallen in recent weeks _and some coutries have experienced more than one change ingovernment.   He said his goal was to see ``individual freedom everywherereplace coercion and tyranny.''   He said the task for Western nations is to consolidate thefruits of this peaceful revolution and provide the architecture orthe continued peaceful changes and end the division of Europe andGermany and create a ``Europe whole and free.''   At the same time, he said the Western alliance ``must remainstrong,'' and said the United States ``will maintain significantmilitary forces in Europe as long as our allies desire ourpresence.''   Even as Bush was preparing to leave for home, Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III was making arrangements for a trip to WestBerlin next week. His trip will take him to the most notable symbolof the Cold War _ the Berlin Wall _ which has effectively crumbled.   A British official said Bush's summit briefing for alliedleaders was ``extremely well-received'' and that today's sessionshowed ``very strong support for the NATO alliance.''   Baker said Bush outlined his agreements and differences withGorbachev. ``Most everyone there was very pleased,'' Baker said onNBC-TV's ``Today'' show.   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, saidthe NATO allies were particularly interested in the issue of Germanreunification, which Gorbachev opposes.   ``The president is certainly not going to stand in the way ofreunification, but it needs to proceed at its own pace,'' Scowcroftsaid on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''   According to a knowledgeable Belgian source, who spoke only oncondition he not be identified, Bush criticized Gorbachev's denialthat the Soviets were supplying arms to leftist rebels in ElSalvador as ``out of step with the new thinking'' in Moscow.   The arrival of Bush's 10-car motorcade at NATO headquarters forthe second meeting of allied leaders this year was heralded by anoisy helicopter, providing security and surveillance for theentourage. NATO staff members applauded Bush as he briskly strodeinto the building.   In opening remarks, NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner saidthe NATO leaders' second meeting since May ``reflects theaccelerated pace of political change across Europe.'' He said ``thequestion of the architecture of the future Europe has arrivedbefore us, more quickly than anyone could have predicted.''   The president, who flew here Sunday night immediately after thesummit, had said the meeting helped dispel Gorbachev's doubts aboutBush's attitude toward economic and political reforms in the SovietUnion, as the United States applauds the fall of hard-linecommunist regimes throughout Eastern Europe.   ``I don't think he has me down as a total negativist at all andI certainly don't have him down'' that way, Bush said beforeleaving the Mediterranean island of Malta, where he held eighthours of discussions with Gorbachev aboard the Soviet cruise linerMaxim Gorky.</TEXT></DOC>
