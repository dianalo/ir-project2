Amid concern about how long the companies can sustainback-breaking losses without taking drastic action, and asthe outlook for a robust recovery in the U.S. economy dims,the Big Three are weighing increasingly severe measures theyhad hoped to avoid. Among them are cutting their dividendseven further, speeding up efforts to shrink their workforces, delaying new products and permanently closing morefactories.</LP><TEXT>   Industry executives, meanwhile, are increasingly concernedthat slower growing personal income, higher personal andgovernmental debt and other negative forces will sap strengthfrom the U.S. vehicle market for several more years.   &quot;The outlook is for domestic demand growth to be below thegrowth of GNP,&quot; warns an internal GM report. &quot;This is mainlythe result of the enormous debt accumulated over the 1980s.&quot;   The clearest sign of Detroit's near-term pessimism is thespeed with which General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. andChrysler Corp. are cutting their once ambitiousfourth-quarter production plans.   Sluggish sales forced Ford this week to shut itsluxury-car factory in Wixom, Mich., for the first time sincethe recession of 1981-82. The big Lincoln Town Cars,Continentals and Mercury Mark VIIs built at that factoryalone contributed more than $1 billion of profit annually forFord in the late 1980s. But Ford sales fell 14% in October,and the company has dropped 50,000 cars from itsfourth-quarter production plans.   General Motors, meanwhile, has slashed 30,000 cars fromits fourth-quarter plans, and Chrysler has lopped some 20,000cars and 30,000 trucks out of its schedule.   The 10 major U.S. auto makers still plan to increasefourth-quarter car and truck production by 15% to 2,502,403vehicles. But that increase is from a year-ago quarter thatsaw U.S. vehicle production fall to the lowest level sincethe previous recession in 1982. The low year-ago U.S.production led to a combined $2.1 billion loss for GM andFord in the 1990 fourth quarter.   Moreover, actual production rates already are fallingbehind the latest schedules. GM, for example, said it plannedto boost fourth-quarter U.S. car production by 21% over adepressed year-ago level. Going into the fourth quarter, GMhad lean inventories of certain models because of productioncuts earlier in the year. But in October, GM built 19,000fewer cars than it had scheduled, and dealers predict morecuts unless sales pick up.   Just six months ago, Detroit executives hoped that thiswould be the quarter that they began to break even. But now,it is virtually certain that GM and Ford, and probablyChrysler, too, will be in the red again for the fourthquarter. Analysts expect the Big Three will keep losing moneyin the first quarter.   &quot;We don't think any of the auto companies is going to beprofitable on an operating basis until the second quarter&quot; ofnext year, says Kidder Peabody auto analyst John V. Kirnan.   Another six months of losses will add to an alreadystaggering $6 billion in red ink that GM, Ford and Chryslerhave rolled up in the 12 months that ended Sept. 30.   So far, investors and lenders have stepped in to financeDetroit's deficits. Chrysler successfully sold $354.4 millionof common stock earlier this month. GM sold about $600million in preferred stock this summer, and raised another$650 million from the sale of certificates backed by leasesof certain factory tools. Ford plans to sell about $750million in preferred shares.   But the Big Three may not have much longer before theymust make tough choices to stop the outflow of cash.   They all have cut their common stock dividends within thepast year. But some analysts say payouts still are at risk.   &quot;If push comes to shove, the auto makers are likely to cuttheir dividends again,&quot; Mr. Kirnan says. &quot;The risk now is50-50 that Ford will have to cut its dividend, GM only about20%, and Chrysler is a virtual certainty.&quot; None of thecompanies will comment on this speculation.   There are other options for conserving cash, such ascutting new product development budgets and slashingemployment levels further. But Big Three executives findthese even less palatable.   Cutting product development can only hurt in such anintensely competitive market. While Japanese auto makers havesuggested they may slow their U.S. expansion efforts, thereis a blitz of new cars coming from Japan. Mazda Motor Corp.has five all-new cars coming in less than a year.   Toyota Motor Corp. just launched a new Camry into themidsized family sedan market, and has a new Corolla scheduledfor next spring. Honda Motor Co.'s new Civic line just hitthe market this month.   Still, there are signs that some of Detroit's new productsare getting delayed by the fiscal crunch. GM, for example,has postponed an overhaul of its compact pickup trucks,originally scheduled for next fall. As a result, a factory inLinden, N.J., will stay shut for an extra year until 1993.   As for slashing payrolls, GM, Ford and Chrysler all aretrying to cut their whitecollar work forces, mainly throughearly retirement. Ford has cut its white-collar staff by3,700 this year, and Chrysler is completing its four-yearprogram to prune its white-collar ranks by 10%, or 3,000jobs. GM has said it will cut 6,000 salaried jobs this yearand another 9,000 by 1993.   But the Big Three are finding it difficult to pare theirwork forces and overhead costs fast enough to keep pace withdeclining sales.   Chrysler officials, who have permanently closed two bigassembly plants in the last two years, have likened theprospect of achieving further cost reduction to wringingwater out of a damp rag.   In the blue-collar arena, GM has the least efficientoperations. And the No. 1 auto maker has cut its productionwork force by some 20,000 people this year, mostly byoffering early retirements and buy-outs. But furtherreductions will be difficult. The United Auto Workers union,which represents some 400,000 Big Three workers, hasintensified its opposition to more cutbacks. The unionsanctioned local strikes to block job cuts at two GMfactories recently.   Here are the latest fourth-quarter production plans:   ---                            CARS                                                                                                                                          1991     1990    % Chg.
