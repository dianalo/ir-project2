But veteran family-business consultants say too manynewcomers lack credentials for untangling complexfamily-business issues, such as succession and siblingrivalry.   Rod Correll, executive director of the Family FirmInstitute, says, &quot;The interest in family-business consultingseems to have doubled over the last two years. And there isno mechanism for credentials.&quot; Membership in the Johnstown,N.Y.-based institute, an organization of consultants andothers serving family businesses, also has doubled, to 500members this year from about 250 in 1988.   New programs for family-business owners are proliferating-- not to mention books, magazine articles and universitycourses -- in a nod to the growing awareness of familyproblems affecting small businesses. In September, the Centerfor Management at the Institute of Living, a psychiatrichospital in Hartford, Conn., will begin quarterly seminars tohelp 50 firms resolve family tensions.   No figures are available on the newcomers catering tofamily businesses, but they range from accountants to familytherapists. Added to those are many big companies that didn'ttarget family businesses a decade ago -- like the accountingconcerns Laventhol andamp; Horwath and Grant Thornton, as well asWall Street firms like Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. --which recently expanded into the booming field.   But John Messervey, longtime director of the NationalFamily Business Council, a Northbrook, Ill., consulting firm,says many newcomers have &quot;invested much in marketing andlittle in training. Frankly, many are not equipped to handlethe problems.&quot;   The Family Firm Institute conference in Atlanta in Octoberwill discuss possible qualifications and credentials for thefield.                                                                                                          Small-Business Issues   Swell PAC War Chest                                                                                                          POLITICAL GIVING by small-business owners is increasing inthe wake of heightened congressional interest in issuesimportant to small companies, says the National Federation ofIndependent Business.   The largest national small-business organization sayscontributions to its political action committee war chestjumped to $214,000 in 1989. While relatively small by PACstandards, that's still three times more than the group evercollected before in a year with no congressional elections.   The federation's PAC receipts have passed $300,000 for thetwo-year election cycle ending this year; the goal is$500,000.   As previously reported, small companies also haveincreased lobbying efforts. Their concern over matters thatcame before Congress this year -- such as federal regulationof fringe benefits, required company leave for new parentsand an increased minimum wage -- also helped swell the PACwar chest, says John Motley, the federation's chief lobbyist.&quot;People give when they're scared and angry,&quot; he says.   Mr. Motley says the federation ran its PAC &quot;as anafterthought&quot; until 1987, when it overhauled its politicalfund-raising machine to make it more effective. He says thefederation now identifies members who are &quot;proven givers,&quot;goes to them repeatedly for contributions and specificallyacknowledges their donations.   But the group is helping candidates in other ways besidesPAC contributions. For instance, Mr. Motley says thefederation is recruiting its members to work in local racesfor candidates with pro-small-business backgrounds. &quot;Nowwe're doing the things the unions have been doing for years,&quot;he says.                                                                                                          Franchise Rules Are   Back Off Drawing Board                                                                                                          THE REVISED DRAFT on legislation to regulate franchisingwas made public last month -- and the most controversialparts had been excised.   A committee of the North American SecuritiesAdministrators Association released the revision for publiccomment, says committee head Debra M. Bollinger, director ofSouth Dakota's securities division. The original draft wasreleased last July. &quot;Substantial redrafting has been done inalmost all of the sections,&quot; Ms. Bollinger says, and severalsections were eliminated.   The committee hopes the revised draft will be adopted as amodel for state franchising legislation. Ms. Bollinger saysthe association, whose members are involved in stateregulation of franchises, is expected to consider the matterat a meeting in August.   Many franchisers opposed the group's original proposal fora Model Franchise Investment Act, says David J. Kaufmann, afranchising lawyer in New York. He says they particularlydisliked provisions regarding termination of franchises. Forexample, the original draft would have required franchisersto buy goods and equipment of terminated franchisees. Mr.Kaufmann called that draft &quot;another effort to kill -- or atleast overregulate -- the goose that laid the golden egg.&quot;   But the newest draft contains no such provisions.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          AMERICAN companies can sell directly to Soviet businessmanagers through an American Business Directory for theU.S.S.R. Amtorg Trading Corp., owned by various Sovietenterprises, and International Delaware Corp., both NewYork-based trade assistance companies, have about 380,000prepaid subscriptions for their joint project. . . . Topexecutives of firms with up to $50 million in sales got&quot;moderate&quot; base salary increases of 5.6% from 1988 to 1989, asurvey of 1,400 executives says. The average chief executivein such a firm earned a 1989 base salary of $116,500, Ernst andamp;Young found.</TEXT></DOC>
