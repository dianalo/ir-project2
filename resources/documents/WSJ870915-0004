RobertsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BELTELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><TEXT>   Does it violate an obscene caller's civil liberties if a phone company shows the caller's phone number to the victim?    How would a victim of acquired immune deficiency syndrome feel if he called a hotline that promised anonymity, only to find that his number appears on a screen attached to the hotline's telephone?    In New Jersey, those issues are being debated in the wake of a proposal by New Jersey Bell Telephone Co. to offer a new feature known as Identa Call. The service pits the state's top consumer protection official and the American Civil Liberties Union, who oppose the new service, against the phone company and law enforcement officials.    Identa Call would transmit a caller's phone number onto a small screen attached to the receiving party's telephone. Residential customers in New Jersey would pay $6.50 monthly for the service from New Jersey Bell, a Newark-based unit of Bell Atlantic Corp., Philadelphia. Business customers would pay $8.50 monthly.    The ACLU says the new feature would discourage people from phoning the authorities with anonymous tips about child abuse. Witnesses are required under New Jersey law to report such cases, the ACLU says.    Or a tax cheater might be afraid to call for information about tax amnesty programs. Some states have offered amnesty periods during which cheaters can pay back taxes without facing a severe financial penalty or a jail term.    Would someone be willing to telephone a newspaper with an anonymous tip? asked Edward Martone, executive director of the ACLU's New Jersey branch.    The civil liberties group contends the phone company would cheat its own customers who pay extra for nonpublished, or unlisted, phone numbers. Their numbers would become known to anyone they call who has the new feature. People who paid for unlisted numbers &quot;would be entitled to a refund,&quot; Mr. Martone said.    Raymond Makul, New Jersey's chief consumer advocate, fears that subscribers to the service will misread numbers on the screen. Hence, innocent people could be falsely accused of making obscene or harassing phone calls.    Mr. Makul argues that the service should be offered only to law enforcement and other emergency response officials. &quot;There seems to be no legitimate public use&quot; for Identa Call, he concludes.    The phone company argues that Identa Call will enhance customers' privacy by allowing them to screen calls. &quot;Our position is that the called party has the right to know who is calling&quot; before deciding whether to answer the phone, says a New Jersey Bell spokeswoman.    Identa Call, she says, is the answer to obscene, crank or other harassing phone calls. An obscene caller would think twice about making the call if his or her number would appear on a screen in the victim's home. The spokeswoman noted that the phone company last year accepted 36,000 requests to investigate harassing phone calls. In 12,000 cases, equipment in the central office was used to try to corral the culprits, she says.    Law-abiding customers who want to remain anonymous can call from a pay phone, the spokeswoman said. Opponents of Identa Call duly note that obscene callers also have this option.    New Jersey Bell, if regulators approve Identa Call, apparently would be the first phone company to offer such a system on an unrestricted basis. The service is offered in other parts of the country, but it comes with a feature that allows the caller to block his or her number from being displayed on the called party's screen.    In addition to Identa Call, New Jersey Bell is seeking regulatory permission to sell &quot;Call Block,&quot; which allows a customer's phone to reject calls from certain phone numbers. A feature known as &quot;Call Trace&quot; enables a called party to have the phone numbers of callers stored in the phone company's computerized switch. Thus, the number of an obscene caller later could be retrieved from that switch by the police.    Regulators are expected to decide soon, perhaps this week, whether to allow the new features, which were the subject of a public hearing yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
