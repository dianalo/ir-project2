Police said the students used iron bars and firebombs to forcetheir way into the prosecutors' building in downtown Seoul andstaged a violent protest for 15 minutes before being overpowered.   Riot police squads using tear gas arrested five students at thegate and another 10 who resisted on the second floor of thebuilding, which houses offices of the prosecutor general and othersenior prosecutors.   ``Punish Chun'' and ``Drive out Yankees,'' the students shoutedas they smashed windowns and furniture and demanded the punishmentof the former president and his wife.   On Friday, scores of people were detained when riot policeroughly broke up a sit-in protest by 150 students and dissidents infront of the National Assembly. Police kicked and punched theprotesters who urged Chun's punishment.   Chun and his family have been the target of opposition chargesof corruption and embezzlement since he stepped down from thepresidency in February.   Dissidents also criticized Chun for being responsible fornumerous cases of torture and brutality during a civil uprising inthe southern city of Kwangju.   They accused Chun, President Roh Tae-woo and the United Statesof masterminding the South Korean army's suppression of the Kwangjuuprising.   Nearly 200 people were killed in the uprising, and dissidentscharge the United States with condoning the suppression.   Radical students have staged violent anti-government andanti-U.S. protests in the past months, demanding the removal of the42,000 U.S. troops stationed here under a mutual defense pact.   They contend the United States has enforced partition of theKorean peninsula and rules the south as a colony. The United Statesand the Soviet Union divided the peninsula at the end of World WarII.   Meanwhile, thousands of war veterans and others held a peacefulanti-communist rally in Seoul today to mark the 38th anniversary ofthe three-year Korean War.   ``Safeguard the Olympics and our nation from communists,'' theyshouted as speakers also denounced leftist groups in the south andthe communist north.   Government officials have accused radicals of playing into NorthKorea's strategy of formenting anti-U.S. sentiment and demandingthe co-hosting of the Olympics opening Sept. 17 in Seoul.   In a memorial statement, government spokesman Chung Han-mocharged that some radical groups even consider the Korean War as``a proper effort to unify the Korean land.''   North Korea invaded the south on June 25, 1950. The UnitedStates and 15 other Western countries formed the U.N. Command tohelp repel the North Korean invasion. China sided with North Koreain the war.</TEXT></DOC>
