More particularly, it      relates to zeolite compositions topologically related to prior known      zeolites but which are characterized as containing framework atoms of iron      and/or titanium, and preferably having a very low content of defect sites      in the structure, as hereinafter disclosed. In general, the preparative      process involves contacting the starting zeolite under controlled      conditions with an aqueous solution of a fluoro salt of titanium and/or      iron, preferably a fluoro salt which does not form insoluble salts with      aluminum. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The crystal structures of naturally occurring and assynthesized zeolitic      aluminosilicates are composed of AlO.sub.4 .sup.- and SiO.sub.4 tetrahedra      which are cross-linked by the sharing of oxygen atoms. The electrovalence      of each tetrahedron containing an aluminum atom is balanced by association      with a cation. Most commonly, this cation is a metal cation such as      Na.sup.andplus; or K.sup.andplus; but organic species such as quaternary ammonium ions      are also employed in zeolite synthesis and, in some instances, appear as      cations in the synthesized product zeolite. In general, the metal cations      are, to a considerable extent at least, replaceable with other cations      including H.sup.andplus; and NH.sub.4 .sup.andplus;. In many instances, the organic      cation species are too large to pass through the pore system of the      zeolite and, hence, cannot be directly replaced by ion exchange      techniques. Thermal treatments can reduce these organic cations to H.sup.andplus;      or NH.sub.4 .sup.andplus; cations which can be directly ion-exchanged. Thermal      treatment of the H.sup.andplus; or NH.sub.4 .sup.andplus; cationic forms of the zeolites      can result in the substantial removal of these cations from their normal      association with the AlO.sub.4 .sup.- tetrahedra, thereby creating an      electrovalent imbalance in the zeolite structure which must be accompanied      by structural rearrangements to restore the electrovalent balance.      Commonly when AlO.sub.4 .sup.-  tetrahedra constitute about 40% or more of      the total framework tetrahedra, the necessary structural rearrangements      cannot be accommodated and the crystal structure collapses. In more      siliceous zeolites, the structural integrity is substantially maintained,      but the resulting &quot;decationized&quot; form has certain significantly different      properties from its fully cationized precursor. </PAR><PAR>  The relative instability of aluminum in zeolites, particularly in the      non-metallic cationic or the decationized form, is well recognized in the      art. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,640,681, issued to P. E. Pickert on      Feb. 3, 1972, there is disclosed a process for extracting framework      aluminum from zeolites which involves dehydroxylating a partially      cation-deficient form of the zeolite and then contacting it with      acetylacetone or a metal derivative thereof to chelate and solubilize      aluminum atoms. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid has been proposed as an      extractant for extracting aluminum from a zeolite framework in a process      which is, in some respects, similar to the Pickert process. It is also      known that calcining the H.sup.andplus; or NH.sub.4 .sup.andplus; cation forms of      zeolites such as zeolite Y in an environment of water vapor, either      extraneous or derived from dehydroxylation of the zeolite itself, is      effective in removing framework aluminum by hydrolysis. Evidence of this      phenomenon is set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 3,506,400, issued Apr. 14, 1970      to P. E. Eberly, Jr. et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 3,493,519, issued May 19, 1970      to G. T. Kerr et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 3,513,108, issued May 19, 1970 to      G. T. Kerr. In those instances in which the crystal structure of the      product composition is retained after the rigorous hydrothermal treatment      involved, infrared analysis indicated the presence of substantial hydroxyl      groups exhibiting a stretching frequency in the area of about 3740, 3640      and 3550 cm.sup.-1. The infrared analytical data of U.S. Pat. No.      3,506,400 is especially instructive in this regard. An explanation of the      mechanism of the creation of these hydroxyl groups is provided by Kerr et      al., in U.S. Pat. No.  3,493,519 wherein the patentees state that the      aluminum atoms in the lattice framework of hydrogen zeolites can react      with water resulting in the removal of aluminum from the lattice in      accordance with the following equation:      ##STR1##      The aluminum which is removed from its original lattice position is      capable of further reaction with cationic hydrogen, according to Kerr et      al. to yield aluminum-containing, i.e., hydroxyloaluminum, cations by the      equation:      ##STR2##      It has been suggested that stabilization of NH.sub.4 Y occurs through      hydrolysis of sufficient framework aluminum to form stable clusters of      these hydroxoaluminum cations within the sodalite cages, thereby holding      the zeolite structure together while the framework anneals itself through      the migration of some of the framework silicon atoms. </PAR><PAR>  It is alleged in U.S. Pat. No. 3,594,331, issued Jul. 20, 1971 to C. H.      Elliott, that fluoride ions in aqueous media, particularly under      conditions in which the pH is less than about 7, are quite effective in      extracting framework aluminum from zeolite lattices, and, in fact, when      the fluoride concentration exceeds about 15 grams active fluoride per      10,000 grams of zeolite, destruction of the crystal lattice by the direct      attack on the framework silicon as well as on the framework aluminum can      result. A fluoride treatment of this type using from 2 to 22 grams of      available fluoride per 10,000 grams of zeolite (anhydrous) in which the      fluorine is provided by ammonium fluorosilicate is also described therein.      The treatment is carried out for the purpose of improving the thermal      stability of the zeolite. It is theorized by the patentee that the      fluoride in some manner becomes attached to the constructional alkali      metal oxide, thereby reducing the fluxing action of the basic structural      Na.sub.2 O which would otherwise result in the collapse of the crystal      structure. Such treatment within the constraints of the patent disclosure      has no effect on either the overall silicon content of the zeolite product      or the silicon content of a unit cell of the zeolite. </PAR><PAR>  Since stability is quite obviously, in part at least, a function of the      Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 content of the zeolite framework, it would appear to be      advantageous to obtain zeolites having lower proportions of Al.sub.2      O.sub.3 while avoiding the structural changes inherent in framework      aluminum extraction. Despite considerable effort in this regard, however,      only very modest success has been achieved, and this has applied to a few      individual species only. </PAR><PAR>  A process for increasing the SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 ratio in zeolites      is disclosed in copending U.S. Ser. No. 315,853, filed Oct. 28, 1981. The      process disclosed therein comprises inserting silicon atoms as SiO.sub.4      tetrahedra into the crystal lattice of an aluminosilicate having a      SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 molar ratio of at least 3 and pore diameters      of at least 3 Angstroms with a fluorosilicate salt in an amount of at      least 0.0075 moles per 100 grams of the zeolitic aluminosilicate on an      anhydrous basis, said fluorosilicate salt being in the form of an aqueous      solution having a pH value within the range of 3 to about 7 and brought      into contact with the zeolitic aluminosilicate at a rate sufficiently slow      to preserve at least 60 percent of the crystallinity of the starting      zeolitic aluminosilicate. </PAR><PAR>  The difficulty which is met in preparing titanium-containing molecular      sieve compositions is further demonstrated by the failure of European      Patent Application No. 82109451.3 (Publication No. 77,522 published Apr.      27, 1983) entitled &quot;Titanium-Containing Zeolites and Method for Their      Production as Well as Use of Said Zeolites&quot;, to actually prepare      titanium-containing molecular sieve compositions. Although the applicants      claim the preparation of titano-aluminosilicates having the pentasil      structure, it is evident from an analysis of the products of the examples      that titanium was not present in the form of a framework tetrahedral      oxide. The products of the examples of European patent Application No.      82109451.3 will be discussed in detail in comparative examples      hereinafter. </PAR><PAR>  Another reference which deals with titano-aluminosilicates is U.S. Pat. No.      4,410,501 to Taramasso. This reference primarily deals with the      preparation of titanium silicates and only in passing does it mention a      titanium/aluminum/silicon composition. The patentee presents one example      (Example 8) in which it is stated that the addition of aluminum changed      the characteristics of the titanium silicate. As will be shown in detail      hereinafter, this change in property is owing to the fact that what      Taramasso made was ZSM-5 and not a titano-aluminosilicate. In fact      Taramasso does not provide any evidence at all to show that titanium was      incorporated into the aluminosilicate lattice. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURE </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a ternary diagram wherein parameters relating to the instant      compositions are set forth as mole fractions. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates to molecular sieves and processes using these      molecular sieves.

The unit empirical formula is given in terms of titanium      and/or iron, aluminum and silicon as shown in Formula (1), above, and does      not include other compounds, cations or anions which may be present as a      result of the preparation or the existence of other impurities or      materials in the bulk composition not containing the aforementioned      tetrahedral units. </PAR><PAR>  The instant process generally comprises a method for removing framework      aluminum from zeolites having SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 mole ratios of      about 3 or greater and substituting therefor one or more elements selected      from the group consisting of titanium and iron. The resulting molecular      sieves contain titanium and/or iron and have crystal structures similar to      that of the initial zeolite. </PAR><PAR>  The process of the invention comprises contacting a crystalline zeolite      having pore diameters of at least about 3 Angstroms and having a molar      SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 ratio of at least 3, with an effective amount      of fluoro salt of titanium and/or iron, preferably in an amount of at      least 0.001 moles per 100 grams of zeolite starting material, said fluoro      salt being in the form of an aqueous solution or slurry and brought into      contact with the zeolite either incrementally or continuously at a slow      rate (optionally in the presence of a buffer) whereby framework aluminum      atoms of the zeolite are removed and replaced by titanium and/or iron      atoms. It is desirable that the process be carried out such that at least      60, preferably at least 80, and more preferably at least 90 percent of the      crystal structure of the starting zeolite is retained and that the Defect      Structure Factor (hereinafter defined) is increased by less than 0.15, and      preferably by less than 0.10. </PAR><PAR>  Crystalline zeolite starting materials suitable for the practice of the      present invention can be any of the well known naturally occurring or      synthetically produced zeolite species which have pores large enough to      permit the passage of water, titanium and/or iron fluoro salts and      reaction products through their internal cavity system. These materials      can be represented, in terms of molar ratios of oxides, as </PAR><EQU>  M.sub.2 /.sub.n O:Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 :x SiO.sub.2 : y H.sub.2 O </EQU><PAL>  wherein &quot;M&quot; is a cation having the valence &quot;n&quot;, &quot;x&quot; is a value of at least      about 3 and &quot;y&quot; has a value of from zero to about 9 depending upon the      degree of hydration and the capacity of the particular zeolite to hold      absorbed water. Alternatively, the framework composition of the naturally      occurring or synthetic zeolite starting material can be expressed in terms      of the mole fraction of framework tetrahedra, TO.sub.2, as: </PAL><EQU>  (Al.sub.a Si.sub.b) O.sub.2 (2) </EQU><PAL>  wherein &quot;a&quot; is the fraction of framework tetrahedral sites occupied by      aluminum atoms and &quot;b&quot; is the fraction of framework tetrahedral sites      occupied by silicon atoms. Should the framework of the starting material      contain atoms in addition to silicon and aluminum, these materials may be      similarly expressed in terms of their &quot;TO.sub.2 &quot; formula in terms of      their fractional occupation of the framework of the starting material. The      algebraic sum of all of the subscripts within the brackets is equal to 1.      In the above example, aandplus;bandequals;1. </PAL><PAR>  Representative of the crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite molecular sieves      which may be employed in the instant process include, but are not limited      to erionite, mordenite, clinoptilolite, zeolite Y, zeolite L, zeolite      LZ-105, zeolite omega, zeolite beta, zeolite TMA offretite, zeolite ZSM-5,      zeolite ZSM-34, zeolite ZSM-35, and zeolite LZ-202. Both naturally      occurring and synthetically prepared zeolite molecular sieves can be used.      Zeolite Y is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,130,007; zeolite L is disclosed      in U.S. Pat. No. 3,216,789; zeolite LZ-105 is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.      4,257,885; zeolite omega is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,241,036; zeolite      beta is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,308,069; zeolite ZSM-5 is disclosed      in U.S. Pat. No. 3,702,886; and ZSM-34 is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.      4,086,186; and zeolite ZSM-35 is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,992,466. </PAR><PAR>  For reasons more fully explained hereinafter, the starting zeolite should      be able to withstand the initial loss of framework aluminum atoms to at      least a modest degree without collapse of the crystal structure unless the      process is to be carried out at a very slow rate. In general, the ability      to withstand aluminum extraction and maintain a high level of      crystallinity is directly proportional to the initial SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2      O.sub.3 molar ratio of the zeolite. Accordingly, it is preferred that the      value for &quot;x&quot; in the formula above, be at least about 3. Also, it is      preferred that at least about 50, and more preferably at least 95% of the      AlO.sub.4 tetrahedra of the naturally occurring or as-synthesized zeolite      are present in the starting zeolite. Most advantageously the starting      zeolite contains as many as possible of its original AlO.sub.4 tetrahedra,      i.e., has not been subjected to any post-formation treatment which either      extensively removes aluminum atoms from their original framework sites or      converts them from the normal conditions of 4-fold coordination with      oxygen. </PAR><PAR>  The cation population of the starting zeolite is not a critical factor      insofar as substitution of titanium and/or iron for framework aluminum is      concerned, but since the substitution mechanism may involve the in situ      formation of salts of at least some the zeolitic cations, it is      advantageous that these salts be water-soluble to a substantial degree to      facilitate their removal from the molecular sieve product. It is found      that ammonium cations form the most soluble salts in this regard and it is      accordingly preferred that at least 50 percent, most preferably 85 or more      percent, of the zeolite cations be ammonium or hydronium cations. Sodium      and potassium, two of the most common cations present in zeolites, are      found to form Na.sub.3 AlF.sub.6 and K.sub.3 AlF.sub.6 respectively, both      of which are only very sparingly soluble in either hot or cold water. When      these compounds are formed as precipitates within the structural cavities      of the zeolite, they are quite difficult to remove by water washing. Their      removal, moreover, is important if thermal stability of the molecular      sieve product is desired since substantial amounts of fluoride can cause      crystal collapse at temperatures as low as 500.degree.

The instant      process generally comprises contacting a crystalline zeolite having a pore      diameter of at least about 3 Angstroms and having a molar SiO.sub.2      /Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 ratio of at least 3, with an effective amount of a      fluoro salt of titanium and/or iron, preferably an amount of at least      0.001 moles of fluoro salt per 100 grams of zeolite starting material,      said fluoro salt being in the form of a solution or slurry, preferably      aqueous and/or alcohols, at an effective pH where the pH value is      generally greater than one (1), more preferably greater than 3 and most      preferably in the range of about 3 to about 7. The fluoro salt solution or      slurry is brought into contact with the zeolite either incrementally or      continuously at a slow rate whereby framework aluminum atoms of the      zeolite are removed and replaced by titanium and/or iron atoms from the      fluoro salt. The fluoro salt is preferably provided as an aqueous solution      or slurry but it is believed that solutions or slurries employing alcohols      and other organic solvents may be employed. </PAR><PAR>  The process generally comprises: </PAR><PAR>  (a) contacting at effective process conditions a zeolite with an effective      amount of a fluoro salt of titanium and/or iron; and </PAR><PAR>  (b) isolating the titanium and/or iron-containing molecular sieve product      from the reaction mixture. </PAR><PAR>  The fluoro salt is in the form of a solution or slurry, preferably aqueous,      and is brought into contact with the zeolite either incrementally or      continuously at an effective rate such that a portion of the framework      aluminum atoms are removed and replaced by titanium and/or iron atoms at a      rate which preferably retains at least 80 percent and more preferably at      least 90 percent of the crystal structure of the starting zeolite. </PAR><PAR>  For reasons more fully explained hereinafter, the starting zeolite should      be able to withstand the initial loss of framework aluminum atoms to at      least a modest degree without collapse of the crystal structure unless the      process is to be carried out at a very slow pace, or the process is to be      buffered as hereinbefore discussed. Accordingly, the SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2      O.sub.3 ratio in the initial Y zeolite starting material is preferably at      least about 3.0. It is preferred that at least about 50%, and more      preferably at least 95%, of the AlO.sub.4 .sup.- tetrahedra of the      naturally occurring or as-synthesized synthetic zeolite are present in the      starting zeolite, i.e., the starting zeolite has not been subjected to any      post-formation treatment which either extensively removes aluminum atoms      from their original framework sites or converts them from the normal      conditions of 4-fold coordination with oxygen. </PAR><PAR>  The fluoro salt used as the aluminum extractant and also as the source of      titanium and/or iron, which is inserted into the zeolite structure in      place of the extracted aluminum, can be any of the fluoro salts having the      general formula: </PAR><EQU>  (A).sub.2/b .SIGMA.F.sub.6 ;(A).sub.2/b .SIGMA.F.sub.5 ; or (A).sub.2/b      .SIGMA.F.sub.4 </EQU><PAL>  wherein &quot;.SIGMA.&quot; is titanium and/or iron and &quot;A&quot; is a metallic or      non-metallic cation, having the valence &quot;b&quot;. Cations represented by &quot;A&quot;      include alkylammonium, NH.sub.4, H.sup.andplus;, Mg.sup.andplus;andplus;, Li.sup.andplus;, Na.sup.andplus;,      K.sup.andplus;, Ba.sup.andplus;andplus;, Cd.sup.andplus;andplus;, Cu.sup.andplus;, Cu.sup.andplus;andplus;, Ca.sup.andplus;andplus;, Cs.sup.andplus;,      Fe.sup.andplus;andplus;, Co.sup.andplus;andplus;, Pb.sup.andplus;andplus;, Mn.sup.andplus;andplus;, Rb.sup.andplus;, Ag.sup.andplus;, Sr.sup.andplus;,      Tl.sup.andplus; and Zn.sup.andplus;andplus;. The ammonium cation form of the fluoro salt is      generally preferred because of its solubility in water and also because      the ammonium cations form water soluble by-product salts upon reaction      with the zeolite, namely </PAL><EQU>  (NH.sub.4).sub.3 AlF.sub.6 and/or (NH.sub.4).sub.2 AlF.sub.5. </EQU><PAR>  The manner in which the fluoro salt of titanium and/or iron and the      starting zeolite are brought into contact and the overall process of      substituting titanium and/or iron for aluminum in the zeolite framework is      believed to be a two-step process in which the aluminum extraction step      tends to, unless controlled, proceed very rapidly while the insertion of      titanium and/or iron is generally relatively slow. If dealumination      becomes too extensive without the substitution of titanium and/or iron the      crystal structure becomes seriously degraded and ultimately collapses.      While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it appears that      fluoride ion acts as the agent for extraction of framework aluminum in      accordance with the equation:      ##STR3##      It is important, therefore, that the initial dealumination step be      inhibited and the step involving insertion of titanium and/or iron be      promoted to achieve the desired molecular sieve products. It is found that      the various zeolites have varying degrees of resistance toward degradation      as a consequence of framework aluminum extraction without substitution of      titanium and/or iron into the framework. The rate of aluminum extraction      generally decreases as the pH of the fluoro salt solution in contact with      the zeolite is increased below about one (1) (and accordingly the pH is      preferably within the range of 3 to 7) and as the concentration of the      fluoro salt of titanium and/or iron in the reaction system is decreased.      Also, increasing the reaction temperature tends to increase the rate of      substitution of titanium and/or iron. Whether it is necessary or desirable      to buffer the reaction system or select a particular fluoro salt      concentration to control the pH it is readily determined for each zeolite      species by routine observation and evaluation. The question of whether the      reaction system may advantageously be buffered will, in large part, depend      on the selection of the particular starting zeolite, since zeolites have      varying tolerances to acid and base media. For example, some zeolites can      withstand very low pH conditions and a high level of dealumination without      collapse of the crystal structure. When it is advantageous to buffer the      reaction mixture in a particular pH range, the reaction mixture may be      buffered in a manner as generally heretofore employed in the art. The use      of buffering salts, such as ammonium acetate, or use of an inert solid to      react with excess acid or base, e.g., clays or aluminas, may be generally      employed to buffer the pH of the reaction mixture. </PAR><PAR>  Theoretically, there is no lower limit for the concentration of fluoro salt      of titanium and/or iron in the aqueous solution or slurry employed,      provided of course the effective pH (the &quot;effective pH&quot; is a pH such that      under effective process conditions a monomeric form of titanium is present      in the reaction system) of the solution or slurry is high enough to avoid      undue destructive acidic attack on the particular zeolite structure apart      from the intended reaction with an effective amount of the fluoro salt,      i.e., that amount which provides sufficient fluoride and amount of      titanium and/or iron for the process and desired amount of titanium and/or      iron in the final molecular sieve product. A slow rate of addition of the      fluoro salt generally provides adequate time for the insertion of titanium      and/or iron as a framework substitute for extracted aluminum before      excessive aluminum extraction occurs with consequent collapse of the      crystal structure. Practical commercial considerations, however, may      require that the reaction proceed as rapidly as possible, and accordingly      the conditions of reaction temperature and reagent concentrations will      necessarily be optimized with respect to each zeolite starting material      and with respect to commercial operation. In general, it is believed that      the more highly siliceous the zeolite, the higher the permissible reaction      temperature and the lower the pH conditions which may be employed in the      instant process. In general, the preferred effective reaction temperature      is within the range between about 10.degree. C. and about 99.degree. C.,      preferably between about 20.degree. C. and 95.degree. C., but temperatures      of 125.degree. C. or higher and as low as 0.degree. C. are believed      employable in some instances with some zeolite starting materials and with      fluoro salts in a form other than aqueous solutions or slurries. At pH      values below about 3 crystal degradation of many zeolites is found to be      unduly severe, whereas at pH values higher than 7, insertion of the      titanium and/or iron may be slow from a practical standpoint as a result      of the solubility of titanium and iron at these pHs and as a result of      certain polymerization reactions. The maximum concentration of fluoro salt      in the aqueous solution employed is, of course, interrelated to the      temperature and pH factors and also with the time of contact between the      zeolite and the solution and the relative proportions of zeolite and      fluoro salt. Solutions having fluoro salt concentrations of between about      10.sup.-3 moles per liter of solution and up to saturation of the solution      can be employed, but is preferred that concentrations in the range of      between about 0.5 and about 1.0 moles per liter of solution be used. In      addition, as hereinbefore discussed, slurries of the fluoro salts of      titanium and/or iron may be employed. The aforementioned concentration      values are with respect to true solutions, and are not intended to apply      to the total fluoro salts in solution or in slurries of the salts in      water. Even very slightly soluble fluoro salts can be slurried in water      and used as a reagent--the undissolved solids being readily available to      replace dissolved molecular species consumed in reaction with the zeolite.      As stated hereinabove, the amount of dissolved fluoro salts employed with      respect to the particular zeolite being treated will depend to some extent      upon the physical and chemical properties of the individual zeolites and      other effective process conditions. However, the minimum value for the      amount of fluoro salt to be added is preferably at least equivalent to the      minimum mole fraction of aluminum to be removed from the zeolite. </PAR><PAR>  In specifying the proportions of the zeolite starting material or      adsorption properties of the zeolite product and the like herein, the      &quot;anhydrous state&quot; of the zeolite will be intended unless otherwise stated.      The term &quot;anhydrous state&quot; is employed herein to refer to a material      substantially devoid of both physically adsorbed and chemically adsorbed      water. In general, a zeolite may be prepared in the anhydrous state by      heating the zeolite in dry air at about 450.degree. C. for about 4 hours. </PAR><PAR>  It is apparent from the foregoing that, with respect to effective process      conditions, it is desirable that the integrity of the zeolite crystal      structure be substantially maintained throughout the process and that, in      addition to having titanium and/or iron atoms inserted into the lattice,      the zeolite retains at least 60 percent, preferably at least 80 and more      preferably at least 90 percent of its original crystallinity. A convenient      technique for assessing the crystallinity of the products relative to the      crystallinity of the starting material is the comparison the relative      intensities of the d-spacings of their respective X-ray powder diffraction      patterns. The sum of the peak heights, in terms of arbitrary units above      background, of the starting material is used as the standard and is      compared with the corresponding peak heights of the products. When, for      example, the numerical sum of the peak heights of the molecular sieve      product is 85 percent of the value of the sum of the peak heights of the      starting zeolite, then 85 percent of the crystallinity has been retained.      In practice it is common to utilize only a portion of the d-spacing peaks      for this purpose as, for example, five of the six strongest d-spacings. In      zeolite Y these d-spacings correspond to the Miller Indices 331, 440, 533,      642 and 555. Other indicia of the crystallinity retained by the zeolite      product are the degree of retention of surface area and the degree of      retention of the adsorption capacity. Surface areas can be determined by      the well-known Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method (B-E-T). J. Am. Chem. Soc. 60      309 (1938) using nitrogen as the adsorbate. In determining the adsorption      capacity, the capacity for oxygen at -183.degree. C. at 100 Torr is      preferred. </PAR><PAR>  All available evidence, to date, indicates that the above described process      of this invention is unique in being able to produce zeolites essentially      free of defect structure and having titanium and/or iron inserted into the      framework by a secondary synthesis process. </PAR><PAR>  In untreated, i.e., naturally occurring or as-synthesized zeolites the      original tetrahedral structure is conventionally represented as      ##STR4##      After treatment with a complexing agent such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic      acid (H.sub.4 ETDA) in which a stoichiometric reaction occurs whereby      framework aluminum atoms along with an associated cation such as sodium is      removed as NaAlEDTA, it is postulated that the tetrahedral aluminum is      replaced by four protons which form a hydroxyl &quot;nest&quot;, as follows:      ##STR5##      The infrared spectrum of the aluminum depleted zeolite will show a broad      nondescript absorption band beginning at about 3750 cm.sup.-1 and      extending to about 3000 cm.sup.-1. The size of this absorption band or      envelope increases with increasing aluminum depletion of the zeolite. The      reason that the absorption band is so broad and without any specific      absorption frequency is that the hydroxyl groups in the vacant sites in      the framework are coordinated in such a way that they interact with each      other (hydrogen bonding). The hydroxyl groups of adsorbed water molecules      are also hydrogen-bonded and produce a similar broad absorption band as do      the &quot;nest&quot; hydroxyls. Also, certain other zeolitic hydroxyl groups,      exhibiting specific characteristic absorption frequencies within the range      of interest, will, if present, cause infrared absorption bands in these      regions which are superimposed on the band attributable to the &quot;nest&quot;      hydroxyl groups. These specific hydroxyls are created by the decomposition      of ammonium cations or organic cations present in the zeolite. </PAR><PAR>  It is, however, possible to treat zeolites, prior to subjecting them to      infrared analysis, to avoid the presence of the interfering hydroxyl      groups and thus be able to observe the absorption attributable to the      &quot;nest&quot; hydroxyls only. The hydroxyls belonging to adsorbed water are      avoided by subjecting the hydrated zeolite sample to vacuum activation at      a moderate temperature of about 200.degree. C. for about 1 hour. This      treatment permits desorption and substantially complete removal of the      adsorbed water. Complete removal of adsorbed water can be ascertained by      noting when the infrared absorption band at about 1640 cm.sup.-1, the      bending frequency of water molecules, has been removed from the spectrum. </PAR><PAR>  The decomposable ammonium cations can be removed, at least in large part,      by ion-exchange and replaced with metal cations, preferably by subjecting      the ammonium form of the zeolite to a mild exchange treatment with an      aqueous NaCl solution. The OH absorption bands produced by the thermal      decomposition of ammonium cations are thereby avoided. Accordingly, the      absorption band over the range of 3745 cm.sup.-1 to about 3000 cm.sup.-1      for a zeolite so treated is almost entirely attributable to hydroxyl      groups associated with defect structure and the absolute absorbance of      this band can be a measure of the degree of aluminum depletion. </PAR><PAR>  It is found, however, that the ion-exchange treatment, which must necessary      be exhaustive even though mild, required considerable time. Also the      combination of the ion-exchange and the vacuum calcination to remove      adsorbed water does not remove every possible hydroxyl other than defect      hydroxyls which can exhibit absorption in the 3745 cm.sup.-1 to 3000      cm.sup.-1 range. For instance, a rather sharp band at 3745 cm.sup.-1 has      been attributed to the Si--OH groups situated in the terminal lattice      positions of the zeolite crystals and to amorphous (non-zeolitic) silica      from which physically adsorbed water has been removed. For these reasons      we prefer to use a somewhat different criterion to measure the degree of      defect structure in the zeolite products of this invention. </PAR><PAR>  In the absence of hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups contributed by physically      adsorbed water, the absorption frequency least affected by absorption due      to hydroxyl groups other than those associated with framework vacancies or      defect sites is at 3710.andplus;-.5 cm.sup.-1. Thus, the relative number of      defect sites remaining in a zeolite product of this invention can be      gauged by first removing any adsorbed water from the zeolite, determining      the value of the absolute absorbance in its infrared spectrum at a      frequency of 3710 cm.sup.-1, and comparing that value with the      corresponding value obtained from the spectrum of a zeolite having a known      quantity of defect structure. The following specific procedure has been      arbitrarily selected and used to measure the amount of defect structure in      the products prepared in the examples appearing hereinafter. Using the      data obtained from this procedure, it is possible, using simple      mathematical calculation, to obtain a single and reproducible value      hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Defect Structure Factor&quot;, denoted      hereinafter by the symbol &quot;z&quot;, which can be used in comparing and      distinguishing the present novel zeolite compositions from their      non-titanium and/or iron containing counterparts. </PAR><PAC>  DEFECT STRUCTURE FACTOR &quot;Z&quot; </PAC><PAC>  (A) Defect Structure Zeolite Standard: </PAC><PAR>  Standards with known amounts of defect structure can be prepared by      treating a crystalline zeolite of the same species as the product sample      with ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid by the standard procedure of Kerr as      described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,442,795. In order to prepare the standard it      is important that the starting zeolite be well crystallized, substantially      pure and free from defect structure. The first two of these properties are      readily determined by conventional X-ray analysis and the third by      infrared analysis using the procedure set forth in part (B) hereof. The      product of the aluminum extraction should also be well crystallized and      substantially free from impurities. The amount of aluminum depletion,      i.e., the mole fraction of tetrahedral defect structure of the standard      samples can be ascertained by conventional chemical analytical procedure.      The molar SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 ratio of the starting zeolite used      to prepare the standard sample in any given case is not narrowly critical,      but is preferably within about 10% of the molar SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2      O.sub.3 ratio of the same zeolite species used as the starting material in      the practice of the process of the present invention. </PAR><PAC>  (B) Infrared Spectrum of Product Samples and Defect Structure Zeolite      Standard: </PAC><PAR>  Fifteen milligrams of the hydrated zeolite to be analyzed are pressed into      a 13 mm. diameter self-supporting wafer in a KBr die under 5000 lbs.      pressure. The wafer is then heated at 200.degree. C. for 1 hour at a      pressure of not greater than 1.times.10.sup.-4 mm. Hg to remove all      observable traces of physically adsorbed water from the zeolite. This      condition of the zeolite is evidenced by the total absence of an infrared      absorption at 1640 cm.sup.-1. Thereafter, and without contact with      adsorbable substances, particularly water vapor, the infrared spectrum of      the wafer is obtained on an interferometer system at 4 cm.sup.-1      resolution over the frequency range of at least 3745 to 3000 cm.sup.-1.      Both the product sample and the standard sample are analyzed using the      same interferometer system to avoid discrepancies in the analysis due to      different apparatus. The spectrum, normally obtained in the transmission      mode of operation is mathematically converted to and plotted as wave      number vs. absorbance. </PAR><PAC>  (C) Determination of the Defect Structure Factor: </PAC><PAR>  The defect structure factor (z) is calculated by substituting the      appropriate data into the following formula:      ##EQU1##      wherein AA (ps) is the infrared absolute absorbance measured above the      estimated background of the product sample at 3710 cm.sup.-1 ; AA (std) is      the absolute absorbance measured above the background of the standard at      3710 cm.sup.-1 and the mole fraction of defects in the standard ar      determined in accordance with part (A) above. </PAR><PAR>  Once the defect structure, z, is known, it is possible to determine from      the wet chemical analysis of the product sample for SiO.sub.2, Al.sub.2      O.sub.3, titanium and/or iron and the cation content as M.sub.2/n O      whether titanium and/or iron has been substituted for aluminum in the      zeolite as a result of the treatment and also the efficiency of the      substitution of titanium and/or iron. </PAR><PAR>  The essential X-ray powder diffraction patterns appearing in this      specification and referred to in the appended claims are obtained using      either: (1) standard X-ray powder diffraction techniques; or (2) computer      based techniques using copper K-alpha radiation and using Siemens D-500      X-ray powder diffractometers with Siemens Type K-805 X-ray sources,      available from Siemens Corporation, Cherry Hill, N.J., with appropriate      computer interface. When employing the standard X-ray technique the      radiation source is a high-intensity, copper target, x-ray tube operated      at 50 Kv and 40 ma. The diffraction pattern from the copper K alpha      radiation and graphite monochromator is suitably recorded by an X-ray      spectrometer scintillation counter, pulse-height analyzer and strip-chart      recorder. Flat compressed powder samples are scanned at 2.theta. (2 theta)      per minute, using a 2 second time constant. Interplanar spacings (d) are      obtained from the position of the diffraction peaks expressed as 2 theta,      where 2 theta is the Bragg angle as observed on the strip chart.      Intensities are determined from the heights of diffraction peaks after      subtracting background. </PAR><PAR>  In determining the cation equivalency, i.e. the molar ratio M.sub.2/n      O/Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 in each zeolite product, it is advantageous to perform      the routine chemical analysis on a form of the zeolite in which &quot;M&quot; is a      monovalent cation other than hydrogen. This avoids the uncertainty which      can arise in the case of divalent or polyvalent metal zeolite cations as      to whether the full valence of the cation is employed in balancing the net      negative charge associated with each AlO.sub.4 .sup.- tetrahedron or      whether some of the positive valence of the cation is used in bonding with      OH.sup.- or H.sub.3 O.sup.andplus; ions. </PAR><PAR>  The following examples are provided to illustrate the invention and are not      intended to be limiting thereof: </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAR>  (1) Ten grams (gm) of an ammonium-exchanged zeolite Y containing 43.5      millimoles of aluminum, as Al.sub.2 O.sub.3, were slurried in 100      milliliters (ml) of an aqueous 3.5 molar solution of ammonium acetate at a      temperature of 75.degree. C. Because of the limited solubility of      (NH.sub.4).sub.2 TiF.sub.6, the fluoro salt was added to the slurry as      crystals. The weight of added (NH.sub.4).sub.2 TiF.sub.6 was 4.78 grams.      The amount of fluoro salt is an amount sufficient to replace 55% of the      aluminum of the zeolite with titanium. The resulting reaction mixture was      then digested for 17 hours at 75.degree. C. The reaction mixture was then      filtered and washed with warm distilled water until qualitative testing of      the wash water was negative for both aluminum and fluoride ions.

Since both oxygen and water capacities      were essentially maintained, the decreased x-ray intensity is believed to      be caused by incorporation of the titanium ion into the structure of the      starting zeolite. The remaining aluminum is considered to be in the      framework since the cation equivalent (M.sup.andplus; /Al) is essentially 1.0.      All of the properties measured are consistent with a highly crystalline      product containing about 13 mole percent titanium substituted in the      zeolitic framework. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 2 </PAC><PAR>  (1) Ten grams of an ammonium-exchanged zeolite Y containing 43.5 millimoles      of aluminum as Al.sub.2 O.sub.3, were slurried in 100 ml of an aqueous 3.5      molar solution of ammonium acetate at a temperature of 75.degree. C.      Because of the limited solubility of (NH.sub.4).sub.3 FeF.sub.6, the salt      was added to the zeolite-water slurry as crystals. The weight of added      (NH.sub.4).sub.3 FeF.sub.6 crystals was 5.41 grams and was an amount      sufficient to replace 55% of the framework aluminum of the zeolite with      iron. Following the addition of the (NH.sub.4).sub.3 FeF.sub.6 crystals,      the reaction mixture was digested under a nitrogen atmosphere at      75.degree. C. for 48 hours. The reaction mixture was then filtered and      washed with warm distilled water until qualitative testing of the wash      water was negative for both aluminum and fluoride ions.

The zeolite peaks were somewhat      broadened and substantially decreased in intensity as compared to zeolite      Y. There appears to be no overall increase in background due to amorphous      material. Since both oxygen and water capacities are essentially      maintained, as compared with the starting zeolite, the decreased x-ray      peak intensity is believed to be caused by incorporation of iron into      zeolite structure of LZ-224. </PAR><PAR>  The above properties are consistent with a highly crystalline molecular      sieve product containing 10 mole percent iron in the framework and      additional iron in a cationic form. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 3 </PAC><PAR>  (1) Twenty-five grams of a hydronium-exchanged synthetic mordenite (ZEOLON      (TM), is a trademark of Norton Co.), containing 52.8 millimoles of      aluminum as Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 were slurried in 450 ml distilled H.sub.2 O.

Because of the limited solubility of (NH.sub.4).sub.2      TiF.sub.6, the salt was added to the slurry as crystals. The weight of      added (NH.sub.4).sub.2 TiF.sub.6 was 11.43 grams and was an amount      sufficient to replace 75% of the framework aluminum with titanium. The      reaction mixture was digested at reflux for 30 minutes, filtered and      washed with warm distilled water until testing of the wash water was      negative for both aluminum and fluoride ions.

A probative measure of the retained crystallinity and      void volume of iron-containing product is available from the H.sub.2 O and      O.sub.2 adsorption capacities which indicate that the products were highly      crystalline. All properties taken together indicate that iron has been      incorporated into the framework of the zeolite L as both cation and      tetrahedral atom. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 7 </PAC><PAR>  1. Ten grams of an ammonium-exchanged, natural mineral clinoptilolite,      containing 25.1 millimoles of aluminum as Al.sub.2 O.sub.3, were slurried      in 250 ml distilled H.sub.2 O. Because of the limited solubility of      (NH.sub.4).sub.2 TiF.sub.6, the salt was added to the slurry as crystals.      The weight of added (NH.sub.4).sub.2 TiF.sub.6 was 2.49 grams and was an      amount sufficient to replace 50% of the framework aluminum of the zeolite      with titanium. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 30 minutes, filtered      and washed with warm distilled water until testing of the wash water was      negative for both aluminum and fluoride ions. The chemical analyses for      the starting clinoptilolite and the molecular sieve product (referred to      herein as LZ-231) are set forth in Table 13. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 13                                                         ______________________________________                                                         Starting LZ-231                                                                Clinoptilolite                                                                          Product                                               ______________________________________                                         Na.sub.2 O, weight percent                                                                       0.55       0.45                                              (NH.sub.4).sub.2 O, weight percent                                                               5.19       4.84                                              K.sub.2 O, weight percent                                                                        0.77       0.54                                              TiO.sub.2, weight percent                                                                        --         3.08                                              Al.sub.2 O.sub.3, weight percent                                                                 12.82      12.10                                             SiO.sub.2, weight percent                                                                        77.90      75.69                                             F.sub.2, weight percent                                                                          --         0.19                                              Na.sup.andplus; /Al:     0.07       0.06                                              NH.sub.4.sup.andplus; /Al:                                                                              0.79       0.78                                              K.sup.andplus; /Al:      0.07       0.05                                              Cation Equivalent,                                                                               0.93       0.89                                              M.sup.andplus; /Al:                                                                   SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 :                                                                    10.31      10.61                                             Si/(Al.sub.2 andplus; Ti.sub.2):                                                                        10.31      9.31                                              ______________________________________                                     </TBL><TBL>                TABLE 14                                                         ______________________________________                                                        Starting   LZ-231                                                              Clinoptilolite                                                                            Product                                              ______________________________________                                         X-Ray Crystallinity:                                                           % by Peak Intensity                                                                              100          75                                              % by Peak Area:   100          75                                              Crystal Collapse 528          None                                             Temp., .degree.C.

The properties of LZ-241 are consistent with the      conclusion that the 8.88 weight percent TiO.sub.2 found in the LZ-241      product represents titanium incorporated into the framework of the ZSM-      zeolite. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 13 </PAC><PAR>  This is a comparative example wherein Example 1 of European Patent      Application No. 82109451.3 was repeated and the product evaluated by      several techniques as hereinafter discussed: </PAR><PAR>  (a) Example 1 of European Patent Application No. 82109451.3 was repeated      with the starting reaction mixture having a composition based on molar      ratios of: </PAR><EQU>  1 Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 :47 SiO.sub.2 :1.32 TiO.sub.2 :11.7 NaOH:28 TPAOH:1498      H.sub.2 O </EQU><PAL>  The reaction mixture was divided and placed in two digestion vessels.

Titanium ethoxide, 26.55 gm, was added      to the distilled H.sub.2 O while stirring. A white gelatinous      precipitate/suspension formed. The above suspension was cooled in an ice      bath to 5.degree. C. at which time 318.6 mL of a separately cooled 30%      solution of H.sub.2 O.sub.2 was added at a moderate rate. The slurry      turned orange with the suspension/precipitate still present. The      temperature was maintained at 5.degree. C. for two hours with occasional      stirring. The precipitate gradually dissolved and the solution became      clear orange. A pre-cooled (5.degree. C.) solution of 22.4% TPA-OH was      added with moderate stirring and at a moderate rate to the titanium      containing solution. The solution changed from orange to yellow. The      solution was stirred at 5.degree.

The NaAlO.sub.2 /Ludox solution      was added to the yellow titanium containing solution. The entire mix      became translucent yellow. The mixture was covered with a watch glass,      removed from the ice bath and allowed to stand at room temperature      overnight. Effervescence continued, even until the next morning. The      covered solution was heated to 75.degree. C. At about 65.degree., the      solution became cloudy and thickened, but as the temperature increased,      the solution became clearer. The solution was heated at 75.degree. C. for      7 hours, then loaded into a 2 liter reactor and heated to 175.degree. C.      for 10 days. On cooling, the crystals were separated from the liquid phase      and the crystals were washed thoroughly with hot distilled water. This      sample was identified as sample TA. </PAR><PAR>  The X-ray powder pattern of sample TA was obtained and was characteristic      of a well crystallized MFI type zeolite, i.e., ZSM-5 or silicalite. The      pattern also showed several additional peaks at 25.3.degree., 47.9.degree.      and 54.9.degree. 2.theta. which are indicative of crystalline TiO.sub.2,      anatase phase. </PAR><PAR>  The chemical analysis of sample TA is shown in the following Table: </PAR><TBL>  ______________________________________                                         (TPA).sub.2 O, wt. %:                                                                              9.13                                                       SiO.sub.2, wt. %:   79.70                                                      Al.sub.2 O.sub.3, wt. %:                                                                           1.30                                                       TiO.sub.2, wt. %:   6.03                                                       SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 :                                                                      103.73                                                     Cation Equivalent, Mandplus;/Al:                                                                          1.60                                                       ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAL>  The data show the incorporation of a substantial amount of TiO.sub.2 into      the product composition with a small amount of Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 as well. </PAL><PAR>  The infrared spectrum of sample TA was also obtained and showed absorption      bands at about 620 cm.sup.-1, 760 cm.sup.-1 and 985 cm.sup.-1. In the      above referenced patent, U.S. Pat. No. 4,410,501, Taramasso reports a band      at about 950 cm.sup.-1 which he attributes to Ti.sup.andplus;4 in tetrahedral      coordination with Si.sup.andplus;4. In Taramasso's subsequent publication with      Perego et al., &quot;Titanium-Silicalite: A Novel Derivative in the Pentasil      Family&quot;, in &quot;New Developments in Zeolite Science and Technology&quot;,      Proceedings of the 7th International Zeolite Conference, Tokyo, Aug.      17-22, 1986, Murakami et al. eds., pp. 129-136, he states on pg. 132, that      the infrared absorption band is located at 970 cm.sup.-1. Inspection of      the spectra presented in the '501 patent does indeed suggest that the band      is located at about 970 cm.sup.-1, and not at the lower frequency as      suggested by Taramasso in column 2, lines 38- 41 of the '501 patent. </PAR><PAR>  In a recent report by Kornatowski et al., &quot;Growth of Large Crystals of      Titanium Molecular Sieve of ZSM-5 Structure, Presented at the 8th      International Zeolite Conference, Amsterdam, Jul. 10-14, 1989, the 970      cm.sup.-1 band assignment is attributed to extra framework TiO.sub.2      species, &quot;contrary to Taramasso&quot;. Both the Taramasso and the Perego      references rely on the report of Best and Condrate, &quot;A Raman study of      TiO.sub.2 --SiO.sub.2 Glasses Prepared by Sol-Gel Processes&quot;, J. Mat. Sci.      Leters 4 (1985), 994-98 which reports on the Raman spectra of TiO.sub.2      --SiO.sub.2 glasses. They suggest a band at about 950 cm.sup.-1 which they      attribute to tetrahedrally coordinated titanium in glasses containing very      small quantities of titanium. The Best et al. paper, supports the premise      that the 620 cm.sup.-1 and 760 cm.sup.-1 bands at least are due to the      presence of anatase TiO.sub.2 and that the 985 cm.sup.-1 band is indeed,      extra framework TiO.sub.2 in transition from the glass phase to anatase,      and not to titanium in tetrahedral coordination with silicon. Thus, none      of the infrared bands observed for the TA sample is attributable to      tetrahedrally coordinated titanium. </PAR><PAR>  SEM and EDAX examination of sample TA showed crystals of several      morphologies. The bulk of the crystals were spherulitic aggregates or      agglomerates, with some rod shaped crystals present. The rod shaped      morphology could be attributable to a silicalite type phase-no aluminum in      the MFI framework, while the spherulitic aggregates are typical of the      ZSM-5 morphology-MFI framework containing aluminum. There was some debris      observed with no regular morphology. In addition, the crystals appeared to      have debris covering their surfaces as well. EDAX showed the presence of a      small amount of titanium throughout the entire sample. There were however,      substantially higher levels of Ti in areas heavy in debris. Since the spot      probe of the EDAX covers areas substantially greater than the crystal      sizes under observation, Analytical Transmission Electron Microscopy was      used to analyze smaller areas of the crystals. The ATEM measures an area      of 200 square Angstroms, rather than the approximately four square micron      areas measured by the spot probe of the SEM. </PAR><PAR>  ATEM examination was performed on the product by two methods. The first,      the &quot;dry brush&quot; method looks only at the outside surfaces of the material      under observation. The other method uses a microtome method to prepare      thin slices of the material, thus allowing the observation and analysis of      the interior portions of the material. In the dry brush method, both      crystal morphologies were examined, as was the debris. Spot probe analysis      of the debris showed that this particle is TiO.sub.2. Spot probe analysis      of the rod-like crystals (morphology of silicalite) showed a small amount      of titanium and nearly no aluminum. The rods have a surface coating of      debris. Crystals with a ZSM-5 type morphology were also analyzed. Aluminum      is present in these crystals, but the level of titanium is very low. Again      these crystals were covered with debris. Microtome analysis of thin      sections of the crystals gave the same results as the dry brush method.      That is, the silicalite rod-like crystal showed very little titanium and      no aluminum while the ZSM-5 type crystals show the presence of aluminum,      but the titanium is barely detectable. </PAR><PAR>  The SEM and EDAX data show that the titanium introduced into the synthesis      gel, precipitated, as the aqueous chemistry at this high pH would predict,      and crystallized as the anatase phase of TiO.sub.2, depositing on the      filter cake with the zeolite crystals and coating the crystals with some      of the tinier, non-agglomerated TiO.sub.2 phases. </PAR><PAR>  The data obtained from the extensive analysis of sample TA shows that there      is no valid reason to conclude that Ti, present in the bulk analysis of      the solid, is present in the framework of the zeolite. The material      contains greater than 6 wt. % TiO.sub.2 ; most of it can be accounted for      by the presence of anatase in the X-ray powder pattern. Another small      fraction can be observed coating the surface of the zeolite crystals.      These small particles are too small to be observed in the X-ray powder      pattern. The Analytical TEM show consistently, that the outside surface of      the crystals (&quot;dry brush&quot; samples) contain more Ti than the interior      portions of the crystal (microtome sections). The fact that a barely      detectable amount of Ti is found inside the crystals can be accounted for      by several reasons, without invoking substitution in the framework. The Ti      could very well be left on the surface of the crystal by the very      technique that allows us to observe the interior portions of the crystal,      the microtome technique. A more likely source is the presence of Ti in the      template, which is inside the zeolite pores as a structure directing      &quot;template&quot; during the synthesis. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 15 </PAC><PAR>  A gel containing 1799.3 gm Al.sub.2 (SO.sub.4).sub.3 dissolved in a      solution of 656.5 gm NaOH in 3,947.3 gm H.sub.2 O is prepared in a 12      liter round bottomed flask and stirred. 4,689.8 gm of Na-silicate is added      gradually to the alumina gel. Heat was applied to the flask and 554.6 gm      of zeolite omega seed is added to the system. The mixed gel was refluxed      for 115 hours, filtered, washed and dried at room temperature. X-ray      powder diffraction analysis of the product showed that the sample      (designated LZ-202-II) is LZ-202 of excellent quality. </PAR><PAR>  About 250 gm of the LZ-202 prepared above are exchanged three times at      reflux with a solution containing 250 gm of ammonium chloride in water.      Following ion-exchange, the product is washed with hot deionized water and      dried at room temperature, and is designated LZ-202-II-NH.sub.4. </PAR><PAR>  a) Two gm (anhydrous weight) of the ammonium-exchanged LZ-202-II-NH.sub.4      are placed in a beaker containing 50 ml of distilled water and heated to      95.degree. C. with stirring. A second solution containing 0.7262 gm of      ammonium fluorotitanate in 50 ml distilled water is prepared and added to      the zeolite slurry in 2 ml increments. This amount is sufficient to react      with and replace 50 atomic percent of the aluminum in the zeolite      framework. Two minutes equilibration time is allowed between each addition      step. Following addition of the fluorotitanate solution, the temperature      of the reaction mixture is maintained at 95.degree. C. and the mixture      digested for one hour. Following digestion, the sample is filtered and      washed free of fluoride.

The      characterization data show that the bulk of the titanium is inserted into      the LZ-202 framework in place of the aluminum. The X-ray powder pattern      does not contain any extraneous peaks nor does it show any increased      background that would be indicative of an amorphous deposit, yet the      samples contain 11-16 weight percent TiO.sub.2. The treated zeolite      products are 33-43 percent depleted in Al but the absorbance in the      hydroxyl region of the infrared spectra, indicative of dealumination, is      relatively insignificant. The asymmetric stretch band in the framework      infrared spectrum is shifted to higher wavenumbers commensurate with the      dealumination. The symmetric stretch band, which shifts to higher      wavenumbers when the smaller Si atom replaces Al in the framework, in this      case has shifted to smaller wavenumbers, perhaps due to substitution of      the larger Ti atom in the framework. All of the properties of the LZ-247      products taken together indicate that titanium has replaced aluminum in      the framework of the LZ-202. </PAR><PAR>  The above Examples do not represent optimized treatment conditions, but      serve merely to demonstrate that Zeolite LZ-202 will withstand the      treatment conditions without serious degradation and that Ti will      substitute for Al in the zeolite framework of LZ-202. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 30                                                         ______________________________________                                                                    EXAM-    EXAM-                                                       LZ-202-II-                                                                               PLE 15   PLE 16                                              LZ-202-II                                                                              NH.sub.4  LZ-247-a LZ-247-b                                   ______________________________________                                         (NH.sub.4).sub.2 O, wt %                                                                  --        8.79      5.77   5.10                                     Na.sub.2 O, wt %                                                                          10.60     andlt;0.02     0.00   0.00                                     Al.sub.2 O.sub.3, wt %                                                                    18.26     18.70     13.05  11.24                                    TiO.sub.2, wt %                                                                           0.00      0.00      11.89  14.02                                    SiO.sub.2, wt %                                                                           70.20     72.98     69.63  70.22                                    F.sub.2 wt %                                                                              --        --        0.39   0.63                                     SiO.sub.2 /Al.sub.2 O.sub.3                                                               6.52      6.62      9.05   10.60                                    SiO.sub.2 /(Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 andplus;                                                            6.52      6.62      5.72   5.90                                     TIO.sub.2 /2)                                                                  Cation     0.95      0.92      0.87   0.89                                     Equivalent,                                                                    Mandplus;/Al                                                                          X-ray                                                                          Crystallinity:                                                                 % by Intensity                                                                            100       117       64     48                                       % by Area  100       120       64     48                                       Framework                                                                      Infrared                                                                       Asymmetric 1036      1038      1048   1051                                     Stretch,                                                                       cm-1                                                                           Symmetric  817       815       814    813                                      Stretch,                                                                       cm-1                                                                           Hydroxyl                                                                       Infrared                                                                       Absorbance 0.107     0.114     0.230  0.250                                    @ 3710 cm-1                                                                    Defect Structure                                                                          0.045     0.048     0.098  0.106                                    Adsorption                                                                     Capacity:                                                                      wt. % O.sub.2                                                                             17.28     18.18     16.39  16.50                                    @ 100 torr,                                                                    and 90K                                                                        wt % H.sub.2 O                                                                            17.76     18.48     15.78  14.68                                    @ 4.6 torr,                                                                    and 239.degree.

These compositions can be impregnated      or otherwise associated with catalytically active metals by the numerous      methods known in the art and used, for example, in fabricating catalyst      compositions containing alumina or aluminosilicate materials. </PAR><PAR>  One use of the crystalline materials of this invention is to separate      mixtures of molecular species. Prior to use in a separation process, the      TASO-45 materials are activated to remove at least some of any molecular      species, e.g., templating agent, which may be present in the      intracrystalline pore system as a result of synthesis. This may be      accomplished as described above, i.e., by heating. </PAR><PAR>  The crystalline materials of this invention are capable of separating      mixtures of molecular species based on the molecular size (kinetic      diameters) or on the degree of polarity of the molecular species. When the      separation of molecular species is based on molecular size, the      crystalline microporous material is chosen in view of the dimensions of      its pores such that at least the smallest molecular specie of the mixture      can enter the intracrystalline void space while at least the largest      specie is excluded. The kinetic diameters of various molecules such as      oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide are provided in D. W.      Breck, ZEOLITE MOLECULAR SIEVES, John Wiley and Sons (1974) p. 636. </PAR><PAR>  When the separation is based on degree of polarity, it is generally the      case that the more hydrophilic TASO-45 material of this invention will      preferentialy adsorb the more polar molecular species of a mixture having      different degrees of polarity even though both molecular species can      communicate with the pore system of the crystalline material. For example      water, which is more polar, will be preferentially adsorbed over common      hydrocarbon molecules such as paraffins, olefins, etc. Thus, the TASO-45      materials of this invention can be used as dessicants in such adsorption      separation/purification processes as natural gas drying, cracked gas      drying, etc. </PAR><PAR>  If one of the molecular species, e.g., water, is a small impurity, the      separation may be effected in the conventional manner by simply passing      the stream to be treated through a bed of the particular crystalline      material desired. As the operation of the process continues, there      develops in the bed a so-called &quot;front&quot; between the material loaded with      the impurity, e.g., water, and the material not so loaded. This front      moves through the bed in the direction of gas flow. Before the front      reaches the downstream end of the bed, the bed is regenerated by cutting      off the flow of feed stream and passing through the bed a purge gas which      (usually at a temperature of about 50.degree.-150.degree. C.) desorbs the      impurity, e.g., water, from the bed. If the purge gas is adsorbed on the      bed, this gas can be removed by passing one or two bed volumes of the feed      stream through the bed. </PAR><PAR>  If the concentration of one of the species in the mixture is large, e.g.,      several percents, other conventional techniques, such as pressure swing      adsorption (PSA) and thermal swing adsorption may be used. Such techniques      are well known to those skilled in the separation art. See, e.g., U.S.      Pat. Nos. 4,723,966, 4,589,888, and 4,398,926. For example, a pressure      swing adsorption process will operate at a temperature and pressure      sufficient to effect the adsorption and desorption of the component or      molecular specie which one wants to remove. Typically the temperature is      preferably maintained in the range of about -50.degree. to 100.degree. C.      and preferably from about 0.degree. to 50.degree. C. The pressure during      adsorption can vary from about 0.2 psia (1.4 kPa) to about 1500 psia      (10,342 kPa), preferably from about 50 psia (344  kPa) to about 500 psia      (3,447 kPa) and more preferably from about 75 psia (517 kPa) to about 350      psia (2,413 kPa). The pressure during desorption is lower than during      adsorption and effective to cause desorption of the adsorbed component.      The range of this pressure is from about 0.1 torr (1.3 Pa) to 150 psia      (1,034 kPa), preferably from about 0.1 torr (1.3 Pa) to 15 psia (103 kPa)      and more preferably from about 0.1 torr (1.3 Pa) to about 250 torr (333      Pa). The cyclic process can comprise additional adsorption and      regeneration steps as well as intermediate depressurization and purging      steps. </PAR><PAR>  The hydrocarbon conversion reactions which may be catalyzed by the instant      molecular sieve compositions include: cracking, hydrocracking; alkylation      of both the aromatic and isoparaffin types; isomerization (including      xylene isomerization); polymerization; reforming; hydrogenation;      dehydrogenation; transalkylation; dealkylation; and hydration. </PAR><PAR>  When catalyst compositions containing the instant molecular sieve      compositions also contain a hydrogenation promoter, such promoter may be      platinum, palladium, tungsten, nickel or molybdenum and may be used to      treat various petroleum stocks including heavy petroleum residual stocks,      cyclic stocks and other hydrocrackable charge stocks. These stocks can be      hydrocracked at temperatures in the range of between about 400.degree. F.      and about 825.degree. F. using molar ratios of hydrogen to hydrocarbon in      the range of between about 2 and about 80, pressures between about 10 and      about 3500 psig, and a liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of between      about 0.1 and about 20, preferably between about 1.0 and about 10. </PAR><PAR>  Catalyst compositions containing the instant molecular sieve compositions      may also be employed in reforming processes in which the hydrocarbon      feedstocks contact the catalyst at temperatures between about 700.degree.      F. and about 1000.degree. F., hydrogen pressures of between about 100 and      about 500 psig, LHSV values in the range between about 0.1 and about 10      and hydrogen to hydrocarbon molar ratios in the range between about 1 and      about 20, preferably between about 4 and about </PAR><PAR>  Further, catalysts containing the instant molecular sieve compositions      which also contain hydrogenation promoters, are also useful in      hydroisomerization processes wherein the feedstock(s), such as normal      paraffins, is converted to saturated branched-chain isomers.      Hydroisomerization processes are typically carried out at a temperature      between about 200.degree. F. and about 600.degree. F., preferably between      about 300.degree. F. and about 550.degree. F. with an LHSV value between      about 0.2 and about 1.0. Hydrogen is typically supplied to the reactor in      admixture with the hydrocarbon feedstock in molar proportions of hydrogen      to the feedstock of between about 1 and about 5. </PAR><PAR>  Catalyst compositions similar to those employed for hydrocracking and      hydroisomerization may also be employed at between about 650.degree. F.      and about 1000.degree.F., preferably between about 850.degree. F. and      about 950.degree. F. and usually at somewhat lower pressures within the      range between about 15 and about 50 psig for the hydroisomerization of      normal paraffins. Preferably the paraffin feedstock comprises normal      paraffins having a carbon number range of C.sub.7 -C.sub.20. The contact      time between the feedstock and the TiSO containing catalyst is generally      relatively short to avoid undesirable side reactions such as olefin      polymerization and paraffin cracking. LHSV values in the range between      about 0.1 and about 10, preferably between about 1.0 and about 6.0, are      suitable. </PAR><PAR>  The low alkali metal content (often not measurable by current analytical      techniques) of the instant compositions make them particularly well suited      for use in the conversion of alkylaromatic compounds, particularly for use      in the catalytic disproportionation of toluene, xylene, trimethylbenzenes,      tetramethylbenzenes and the like. In such disproportionation processes it      has been observed that isomerization and transalkylation can also occur.      The catalysts containing the instant molecular sieve compositions and      employed for such processes will typically include Group VIII noble metal      adjuvants alone or in conjunction with Group VI-B metals such as tungsten,      molybdenum and chromium which are preferably included in such catalyst      compositions in amounts between about 3 and about 15 weight % of the      overall catalyst composition. Extraneous hydrogen can, but need not, be      present in the reaction zone which is maintained at a temperature between      about 400.degree. and about 750.degree. F., pressures in the range between      about 100 and about 2000 psig and LHSV values in the range between about      0.1 and about 15. </PAR><PAR>  Catalysts containing the instant molecular sieve compositions may be      employed in catalytic cracking processes wherein such are preferably      employed with feedstocks such as gas oils, heavy naphthas, deasphalted      crude oil residues, etc., with gasoline being the principal desired      product. Temperature conditions are typically between about 850.degree.      and about 1100.degree. F., LHSV values between about 0.5 and about 10,      pressure conditions are between about 0 psig and about 50 psig. </PAR><PAR>  Catalysts containing the instant molecular sieve compositions may be      employed for dehydrocyclization reactions which employ paraffinic      hydrocarbon feedstocks, preferably normal paraffins having more than 6      carbon atoms, to form benzene, xylenes, toluene and the like.      Dehydrocyclization processes are typically carried out using reaction      conditions similar to those employed for catalytic cracking. For such      processes it is preferred to use a Group VIII non-noble metal cation such      as cobalt and nickel in conjunction with the molecular sieve composition. </PAR><PAR>  Catalysts containing the instant molecular sieve compositions may be      employed in catalytic dealkylation where paraffinic side chains are      cleaved from aromatic nuclei without substantially hydrogenating the ring      structure at relatively high temperatures in the range between about      800.degree. F. and about 1000.degree. F. at moderate hydrogen pressures      between about 300 and about 1000 psig with other conditions being similar      to those described above for catalytic hydrocracking. Catalysts employed      for catalytic dealkylation are of the same type described above in      connection with catalytic dehydrocyclization. Particularly desirable      dealkylation reactions contemplated herein include the conversion of      methylnaphthalene to naphthalene and toluene and/or xylenes to benzene. </PAR><PAR>  Catalysts containing the instant molecular sieve compositions may be used      in catalytic hydrofining wherein the primary objective is to provide for      the selective hydrodecomposition of organic sulfur and/or nitrogen      compounds without substantially affecting hydrocarbon molecules present      therewith. For this purpose, it is preferred to employ the same general      conditions described above for catalytic hydrocracking. The catalysts are      the same typically of the same general nature as described in connection      with dehydrocyclization operations. Feedstocks commonly employed for      catalytic hydroforming include: gasoline fractions; kerosenes; jet fuel      fractions; diesel fractions; light and heavy gas oils; deasphalted crude      oil residua; and the like. The feedstock may contain up to about 5 weight      percent of sulfur and up to about 3 weight percent of nitrogen. </PAR><PAR>  Catalysts containing the instant molecular sieve compositions may be      employed for isomerization processes under conditions similar to those      described above for reforming although isomerization processes tend to      require somewhat more acidic catalysts than those employed in reforming      processes. Olefins are preferably isomerized at temperatures between about      500.degree. F. and about 900.degree. F., while paraffins, naphthenes and      alkyl aromatics are isomerized at temperatures between about 700.degree.      F. and about 1000.degree. F. Particularly desirable isomerization      reactions contemplated herein include the conversion of n-heptane and/or      n-octane to isoheptanes, isooctanes, butane to iso-butane,      methylcyclopentane to cyclohexane, meta-xylene and/or ortho-xylene to      para-xylene, 1-butene to 2-butene and/or isobutene, n-hexene to isohexane,      cyclohexane to methylcyclopentene, etc. The preferred cation form is a      combination of a molecular sieve of this invention and polyvalent metal      compounds (such as sulfides) of metals of Group II-A, Group II-B and rare      earth metals. For alkylation and dealkylation processes the instant      molecular sieve compositions having pores of at least 5.ANG. are      preferred. When employed for dealkylation of alkyl aromatics, the      temperature is usually at least 350.degree. F. and ranges up to a      temperature at which substantial cracking of the feedstock or conversion      products occurs, generally up to about 700.degree. F. The temperature is      preferably at least 450.degree. F. and not greater than the critical      temperature of the compound undergoing dealkylation. Pressure conditions      are applied to retain at least the aromatic feed in the liquid state. For      alkylation the temperature can be as low as 250.degree. F., but is      preferably at least 350.degree. F. In alkylation of benzene, toluene and      xylene, the preferred akylation agents are olefins such as ethylene and      propylene. </PAR><PAR>  The molecular sieve compositions of this invention may be employed in      conventional molecular sieve processes as heretofore have been carried out      using aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or other commonly employed      molecular sieves. The instant compositions are preferably activated, e.g.,      calcined in air or nitrogen, prior to their use in a molecular sieve      process. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  We claim as our invention: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
