(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A lawyer who bankrupted a Ku Klux Klanfaction with a $7 million civil judgment is going after anotherwhite supremacist group with a lawsuit on behalf of the family ofan Ethiopian who was beaten to death.   The $10 million wrongful death suit goes to trial Oct. 8 inanother test of the idea of attacking racist groups through theirwallets.   Three skinheads confessed to bludgeoning Mulugeta Seraw to deathwith baseball bats.   The lawsuit contends Tom Metzger, the founder of White AryanResistance, incited the killing by sending agents to a Portlandskinhead group with a message of hate for blacks and Jews. Metzgerdenies the charge.   The lawsuit will be argued by Morris Dees, a lawyer for theAlabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center. He won a $7 millioncivil judgment three years ago against the United Klans of Americaafter two Klansmen from Mobile, Ala., killed a 19-year-old blackman.   Metzger, a former KKK grand dragon from Fallbrook, Calif., andWhite Aryan Resistance are named as defendants, along withMetzger's son, John, and two of the men who confessed to killingSeraw.   The case has drawn threats from a white supremacist groupsuspected in the Sept. 15 bombing of the federal courthouse in SanDiego. The FBI is investigating the previously unknown group, theHoly Church of the White Fighting Machine of the Cross.   No one was injured in the explosion. But a letter the group sentto KNSD-TV of San Diego said it could not guarantee there would notbe injuries in the future. And it warned ``all concerned to dropthe lawsuit in Portland, Ore.''   Metzger said he had never heard of the group, but added thatother supporters would be in Portland for a fund-raising eventduring the trial.   Civil rights groups also plan rallies and a march during thetrial.   ``Metzger symbolizes the rise of white hate groups in thiscountry over the last 10 years,'' said Ron Herndon, a blackactivist in Portland. ``The trial and what happens to him will senda strong message one way or the other to the country.''   The lawsuit claims that, hours before Seraw was slain, two ofMetzger's agents spoke to the attackers and other members of aneo-Nazi gang, East Side White Pride.   ``Dave Mazzella and I told these skinheads that blacks and Jewswere the enemy of the white Aryan race,'' Michael Barrett said inan affidavit for the lawsuit.   ``We told them to use violence if they got the opportunity andto be sure and beat the hell out of the enemy. We were telling themwhat Tom and John Metzger told us to say to skinheads we wereorganizing.''   Barrett said he had since quit the white supremacist movement.   In a telephone interview from California, Metzger denied he sentBarrett and Mazzella to Portland.   Seraw, 27, was attacked Nov. 18, 1988, by Kenneth Mieske, KyleBrewster and Steven Strasser, members of East Side White Pride.   The three men and their girlfriends drove up as Seraw was beingdropped off by friends.   ``They deliberately went up there for the purpose of starting afight,'' police Detective Tom Nelson said. ``Seraw was defendinghimself against Brewster when Mieske came up and blindsided Serawwith a baseball bat.''   The blow to the head knocked Seraw to the pavement. Mieskesmashed Seraw's head twice more, splitting the bat lengthwise,police said.   Mieske admitted he killed Seraw because he was black. He pleadedguilty to murder and racial intimidation, Brewster pleaded guiltyto manslaughter and racial intimidation, and Strasser pleadedguilty to manslaughter.   Mieske was sentenced to life with a 20-year minimum, Brewster to10 to 20 years and Strasser to 20 years.   Despite the confessions, Metzger contends the killing was inself-defense. ``We've been saying from the beginning that it wasmutual combat provoked by the Ethiopians,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
