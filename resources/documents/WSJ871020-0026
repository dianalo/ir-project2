Sharply rising interest rates are increasing the pressure to solve quickly the problems of American Savings, which is the nation's largest thrift and the main unit of Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. of America, the officials said.    Separately, Financial Corp. reported a third-quarter loss of $75.8 million, further eroding its already thin capital base. A year earlier, Financial Corp. had net income of $11.6 million, or 24 cents a share.    Talks between Ford and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board resumed Saturday, officials said. James W. Ford, head of Ford's Financial Services Group, and Anthony M. Frank, chairman of Ford's thrift unit, met in New York with Roger Martin, one of three members of the Bank Board, and representatives of Salomon Brothers Inc., which is advising the Bank Board.    At the meeting, the Ford executives made several significant concessions to reduce the amount of assistance Ford would require from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to take over American Savings, officials said.    One of the concessions concerned reimbursements by FSLIC to cover future operating losses of American Savings, the officials said. Ford's latest proposal calls for Ford to make payments to the FSLIC if American Savings generates operating profits.    Officials said Mr. Martin seemed receptive to Ford's latest proposal, but cautioned that the other two members of the Bank Board haven't disclosed their views, and that other federal agencies, including the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board, probably will be consulted.    As other evidence of the Bank Board's growing sense of urgency over problems at American Savings and Financial Corp., the officials cited the Bank Board's recent hiring of Sullivan andamp; Cromwell, a major New York corporate law firm, to represent it in the Financial Corp. matter. The officials said Sullivan andamp; Cromwell was hired at the suggestion of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. officials because the firm is better prepared to work out the legal details of a major transaction than the Bank Board's own legal staff.    Another factor that has increased the Bank Board's interest in arranging a transaction with Ford, the officials said, is a growing realization that a break-up plan proposed by Financial Corp. will take too long to implement.    A Bank Board spokesman would say only that &quot;discussions are continuing with Ford. They may continue.&quot; A spokesman for Sullivan andamp; Cromwell confirmed that the firm was hired by the Bank Board to work on Financial Corp.'s problems. Ford officials didn't return telephone calls seeking comment. The FDIC declined comment.    A major problem facing Financial Corp., because of the rise in interest rates and the resulting fall in prices of mortgage-backed securities, is that the company must put up more securities as collateral for $12.8 billion in borrowings from Wall Street firms and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.    William J. Popejoy, chairman of Financial Corp., confirmed that the company has been asked to pledge more collateral and has met those demands, but wouldn't specify an amount. He said the Bank Board is concerned about the issue. &quot;The Bank Board and FCA are coordinating very closely its collateral position and its responsiveness to Wall Street to avoid problems whenever possible,&quot; he said. However, he added, &quot;There's no sense of crisis here.&quot;    Analysts and officials familiar with Financial Corp. have estimated that there are nearly $3 billion of unrealized losses in its portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, which was purchased for $17.9 billion. Mr. Popejoy wouldn't comment on those estimates.    It still isn't clear how the Bank Board will treat current shareholders of Financial Corp. if it agrees to provide aid for a Ford takeover of American Savings. Analysts and officials familiar with the negotiations expect that the shareholders' stake in American Savings would be severely diluted or wiped out.    In yesterday's market crash, Financial Corp. common fell 50 cents to close at $2 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Financial Corp.'s third-quarter loss was caused by a $70.4 million boost to loan-loss reserves and the absence of big gains from sales of loans and mortgage-backed securities, which had boosted the year-earlier net. </TEXT></DOC>
