As a journalist I havelearned to accept bias of leading papers of the country, butto openly embrace clandestine activities of the president andhis supporters against the laws of this country is repulsive.I don't believe all pro-business Republicans are criminals. Idon't believe you need to cater to those who are.   Lucia E. Cape</LP><TEXT>   Atlanta</TEXT></DOC>
