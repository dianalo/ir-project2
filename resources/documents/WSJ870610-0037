The two companies -- famed for their expensive champagnes, perfumes and other luxury goods -- announced merger plans last week, and their shares have faltered since. Moet-Hennessy has been almost unchanged on the Paris market, defying many predictions that the merger could send it as much as 5% higher in the short-term. Despite big publicity in the media and generally favorable reviews, Louis Vuitton has fared much worse: its stock has dropped almost 10% in the U.S., where it's traded over-the-counter as American depositary shares.    For some, that spells a good buying opportunity, even if the stocks are relatively expensive. Louis Vuitton closed in New York Tuesday at 42 1/2, well below 46 7/8 on June 2, the day before the merger was announced. Louis Vuitton trades at about 20 times estimated 1987 earnings while Moet-Hennessy, which doesn't have an official ADS listing, is priced at about 17 times earnings. By comparison, the French market carries an average P/E of between 15 and 17.    &quot;We're a little dismayed that the stock took a hit on the announcement,&quot; says William B. Astrop, chairman of Astrop Advisory Group, an Atlanta-based fund that holds a substantial chunk of Louis Vuitton ADSs. &quot;We think (the merger) is very positive and really does create a superbly elegant upscale empire of luxury goods.&quot;    The weak French stock market is blamed for the lackluster performance of the two stocks. After solid gains earlier in the year, the market has been thrown off course recently by political and economic jitters. Some forecasts of the nation's economic growth have been cut substantially, and Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's authority took a blow last week in a feud with the leader of a small conservative party. &quot;In a market like this you can't expect to find much enthusiasm,&quot; says Charles G. Hildeburn of Baring Securities in New York.    There are also worries about terms of the merger. Under the proposal, one Moet-Hennessy share or 2.4 Louis Vuitton shares can be swapped for each share in the new merged company. Although many analysts consider the ratio a fair reflection of the sizes of the two companies, some believe Moet-Hennessy comes out better than Louis Vuitton does.    For one thing, the merger is likely to end Moet-Hennessy's fears of a hostile takeover. For months, the company has been viewed as a potential target, especially after Italian entrepreneur Carlo de Benedetti snapped up a chunk of Yves Saint Laurent last year. &quot;Moet really was anxious to keep its independence,&quot; says Colin Humphreys at Vickers da Costa in London.    Nonetheless, the product similarities of the two companies mean the merger is &quot;a marriage made in heaven,&quot; enthuses Reginald Duquesnoy of Drexel Burnham Lambert in New York. &quot;It makes good industrial sense. They are catering to the same base of customers.&quot;    The two firms estimate combined sales will be 13 billion French francs (more than $2 billion) this year, while net income should be more than 1.3 billion francs (more than $200 million). While the new group will be listed in Paris, it isn't clear whether it will trade as an ADS in the U.S.    The numbers belie the underlying strength of the new group. It will dominate the world champagne market; its Moet andamp; Chandon, Veuve Cliquot and other brands have a combined world market share around three times that held by the No. 2 company, Canada's Seagram. It also will become a major player in perfumes, with Louis Vuitton's Givenchy and Guerlain fragrances joining Moet-Hennessy's Christian Dior. Moet-Hennessy already is the leading producer of cognac, with a world market share of about 20%, and Louis Vuitton's luxury luggage business continues to expand rapidly.    An agreement between Moet-Hennessy and Britain's Guinness to merge distribution activities in the U.S., Japan and the Far East, announced at the same time as the Louis Vuitton link, is likely to strengthen the group further.    Moet-Hennessy and Louis Vuitton intend to keep their operations separate at the beginning to ensure flexibility, says Francois Poirel, president of Louis Vuitton's U.S. operations, though cooperation in some areas is possible later on. Some analysts say the merged group could cut costs by teaming up on research and development, advertising, and maybe eventually distribution of some products. Mr. Poirel says that &quot;even if we market the products separately, the merger gives us a stronger position with customers. We will become a force to be reckoned with.&quot;    He doesn't expect any antitrust problems, despite the big market shares of the new group. Others play down worries of management conflicts between the two old family-owned companies, pointing to Moet's successful merger with Hennessy in 1971. &quot;It could become a Harvard Business School case on synergy,&quot; maintains Bertrand F. Facon of First Boston in New York. </TEXT></DOC>
