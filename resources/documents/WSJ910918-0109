Nowthere is only Thomas Hendricks, and he, too, may soon begone.   The bearded, soft-spoken 42-year-old operates the CrossGold Mine here in the Rockies, 9,700 feet above sea level.Since 1971, when he dropped out of the University of Coloradoto take a job as night foreman at the nearby Comstock mine,Mr. Hendricks has been searching for gold here. Since he was10 years old, that is all he ever wanted to do.</LP><TEXT>   But the world he knew is disappearing. The Comstock minehas long since closed, and only an archaeologist coulddemarcate the old town-site of Caribou. Much of the U.S.hard-rock mining industry has been taken over by big foreigncompanies. And towns hereabouts that once were devoted to theneeds of miners have adjusted their economies to serve thegrowing tourist industry. Environmental legislation hasraised the hurdles for mining.   The last straw for Mr. Hendricks and the few others likehim may be a bill now pending before Congress that coulddrastically change the cost structure of mining in the U.S.The Mining Law of 1872, which established the regulation ofmining on federal lands, was designed to lure prospectors tothe West with the promise of cheap access to minerals. Underthe law, miners could stake claims on federal lands -- andhold onto them indefinitely -- merely by spending $100 a yearper 20-acre claim looking for metals. If, for example, theystruck gold or silver, they could then &quot;patent,&quot; or buy, theland for as little as $2.50 an acre. Also, they could sellwhatever they found, without paying royalties of any kind tothe government.   The law has almost always had critics who thought thatthat was far too sweet a deal. And as the benefits startedflowing to larger and larger companies over the years, thecriticism reached a climax. &quot;More and more mining companiesare going into foreign hands,&quot; complains U.S. Rep. BenNighthorse Campbell, a longtime mining supporter fromColorado's Western Slope. &quot;They get the gold, and we get theshaft.&quot;   The law has also led to abuses. In one notorious 1983case, a speculator who claimed he intended to mine preciousmetals found a small body of ore, as the mining law requiresfor a patent, and then acquired 160 acres of U.S. ForestService land near Keystone Ski Resort for just $400. What hereally was mining was money; he sold 44 acres to developersfor $11,000 an acre.   More recently, a lawyer for a prospector holding an oldclaim in what is now Colorado's Maroon Bells wilderness nearAspen called the state's Democratic Sen. Tim Wirth to findout how much the U.S. would pay to keep him from mining. Thefederal government has been known to buy out claims -- atreasonable prices. But the miner wants $5 million. &quot;This isnothing but a clear {attempt} to hold up the taxpayer,&quot; Mr.Wirth says.   Bills introduced by Sen. Dale Bumpers and Rep. Nick JoeRahall, Democrats from Arkansas and West Virginia,respectively, seek to prevent such problems. Proposed changesin the law would increase the annual cost of holding miningclaims to as much as $3,200 per acre (up from $100);eliminate patenting; charge royalties on minerals extractedfrom federal lands; and create a nationwide reclamation lawto replace a patchwork of state laws. It is likely thatCongress will adopt some of these proposals.   Reforms would hit hardest such small miners as Mr.Hendricks, who already have trouble surviving in a hostileeconomic environment. While small companies once dominatedmining in this region, fewer than 10 small hard-rock minescurrently operate in Colorado. And Mr. Hendricks has had tohalt his gold-mining operations, at least temporarily, whilehe seeks cash.   &quot;Many years, when July or August rolls around, I have toreally scramble to come up with the $3,000&quot; needed tomaintain 30 unpatented 20-acre claims that protect his minefrom encroachment, Mr. Hendricks says. If a strict new lawwere passed, he says the added expense would force him toabandon most of those claims, forfeiting much of the $100,000he has spent over the years on claim work.   It could be the end of the line for Mr. Hendricks and hiskind, the lone-wolf prospectors who were so much a part ofthe lore of the West. In an era of bigness, Mr. Hendrickscontinues to operate the old-fashioned way, handlingeverything from obtaining financing and permits toprospecting, mining and milling. &quot;In America today, thefarther away you get from where the real work is done, themore money you make,&quot; says Hans Von Michaelis, a Denvermining consultant. &quot;Tom is trying to buck that trend.&quot;   As a youngster, Tom Hendricks went camping with hisfather, a limestone quarry owner, near mining ghost towns. Hecaught gold fever. In high school he wrote papers on mining,and he dropped out of the University of Colorado as a seniorwhen offered the night foreman job at the Comstock Mine. Heleased the cabin at the nearby Cross Gold Mine and ended upas caretaker of that mine as well.   The Comstock Mine closed in 1972, a victim of decliningsilver prices. But encouraged by old-time miners in the area,he eventually got a lease on the Cross Gold Mine and startedmining with a wheelbarrow, pick and shovel, with a couple ofdogs as companions. A Denver businessman supplied him with agrubstake of $2,500 a month, which enabled him to hire ahelper, pump water out of the old mine and start testingrocks for mineral content.   Caribou, with its rich mining history, would seem a likelyplace to look for gold. Founded in 1869 by a trapper andprospector named Sam Conger, the town boomed with thediscovery of silver. Some 800 prospectors came to seek theirfortunes and many succeeded, extracting 20 million ounces ofsilver from 11 mines in the area. But Caribou started todecline after the 1894 repeal of the Sherman Silver Act,which had set a silver standard for currency. Silver pricesplummeted. The town burned in 1905 and was never rebuilt.   Gold and silver mining languished in the West for decades.Poor prices and old techniques thwarted mine development. Ittook a new, low-cost method of leaching microscopic gold fromore -- and, of course, higher gold prices -- to bring thegold boom back in the mid-1980s.   Even through the slow times, though, miners like Mr.Hendricks would periodically open up old mines and work themuntil their grubstakes ran out. Hendricks Mining Co. shippedits first concentrated ore to a smelter in Canada in thespring of 1977. Mr. Hendricks got $18,000 for gold that costabout $30,000 to produce. &quot;That first check was my first bigheartbreak,&quot; he says.   But his timing was good. Gold prices soon started to rise.And by 1979, Mr. Hendricks had 10 employees dynamiting rock,mucking out ore, milling it and shipping it to Canada forrefining. That Christmas, with gold selling at $800 an ounce,he was paid $178,000 for one shipment. &quot;I thought we werereally onto something,&quot; he says.   Unfortunately, when the silver market crashed in 1981, itdragged down gold prices, too. In 1982, Mr. Hendricks laidoff his workers and pressed on by himself. Over the next fewyears, he attracted and then lost three different foreigninvestors; all of them eventually backed out and put theirmoney elsewhere. &quot;We've always been the victim of some otherproject,&quot; he says. Occasionally, he and a lone helper wouldmuck ore to raise some cash to pay bills.   Now, even that requires more money than he has. He stillowes $347,000 on a $4 million mortgage on the mine and hasrun up bills totaling about $65,000 on his many Visa andMasterCard accounts. He has sold personal belongings,borrowed on the equity of a townhouse he owns in Boulder andowes $397,000 on various loans and notes, $138,000 inaccounts payable.   Meanwhile, mining is getting more and more expensive.Rails for the locomotive that hauls ore out of the tunnelscost $190 a ton in 1973 and were made in the U.S.; today,they're $1,200 a ton and have to be imported from Belgium.Dynamite cost $19 per 100 pounds in 1973; now it's $165. Andpaper work and testing required by regulations now take upseveral hours a week, even with the mine closed.   It's hard for Mr. Hendricks to find people to commiseratewith about his financial predicament. The mining industry'scutbacks in recent years have left him with few peers. Afteryears of automation, layoffs and mine closings, hard-rockmining employs only 180,000 people nationwide according tothe Bureau of Mines. (Twice that many people work for IBM.)   &quot;The mining industry has gone through a metamorphosis fromlow-tech industry to high-tech industry, and that means moreproduction with fewer people,&quot; says Philip Burgess, presidentof Center for the New West, a Denver think tank. &quot;From aneconomic point of view, that's a success story. But it's adisaster from a political point of view because there arefewer people with a stake in the industry.&quot;   Nearby Nederland, which used to be a mining town, is now atourist mecca and a bedroom community for the University ofColorado in Boulder. Backpackers and skiers dominate the townon weekends. The only clues to Nederland's mining past arethrough the courtesy of Mr. Hendricks: ore buckets he donatedthat have been turned into flowerpots, and a welcome sign atthe entrance to town that looks like the head frame of amine. And instead of miners as neighbors, Mr. Hendricks isnow surrounded by second homes and ex-urbanites who fled thecity. Many of them, it turns out, are downright hostile tomining. A neighbor once threw old tires and big rocks on theroad to block his ore trucks from passing her place. &quot;Theydon't want to hear an ore bucket or a compressor,&quot; Mr.Hendricks says.   Still, being a good environmental neighbor is Mr.Hendricks's goal and his challenge. Environmental regulationsrequire that water draining from the mine into the creek bepristine. Several times, Mr. Hendricks admits, he has slippedout of compliance as the standards were ratcheted up to meetpublic demands for clean water. His only citation to datecost him a $500 fine several years ago; the costs of bringinghis mine into compliance have been considerably higher.   He shows a visitor the new water-purification system hebuilt, one that pleases regulators for the time being. Fromtwo plastic-lined ponds, mine water flows through filters andthen through a natural bog full of plants that absorb heavymetals. The environmentally sensitive design, which won anaward from Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, cost $40,000. &quot;We want toshow underground mining can operate environmentally with noproblem and be a good neighbor to everybody,&quot; he says.   But that will take money. With gold hovering around $345an ounce, mining companies are cautious about theirinvestments, and their reviews are taking months. Every week,Mr. Hendricks drives to Denver to meet with mining-companyexecutives who might put money in his operation. He has giventhem regular tours. So far, he has shown his mine or hisplans to 17 mining companies.   While he's waiting, Mr. Hendricks tries to stay busy andkeep his spirits up. He jots down a list of the day's choreson a legal pad while drinking his morning coffee. Then,accompanied by a big mutt named Bart, he does his dailywater-quality tests, cleans out old trash piles, checks thewater level in the deep shafts and keeps the big machinery inworking order.   He's sure he'll need those machines soon. &quot;We'll get itdone,&quot; he says optimistically. &quot;We'll prove once and for allthis mine is economical.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
