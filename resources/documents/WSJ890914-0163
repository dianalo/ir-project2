The trend estimate, which removes many of the irregular influences to identify the longer-term trend, rose 0.7% in the latest quarter.    The growth in the trend estimate narrows from a revised 2% growth in the first quarter. That rise was originally reported as 1%. The trend estimate rose 7.2% from the second quarter of 1988.    The figures are adjusted for both seasonal factors and price changes. </TEXT></DOC>
