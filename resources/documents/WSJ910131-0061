The New York Stock Exchange has been investigating thebranch, at 55 Water St. in lower Manhattan, for a variety ofpossible abuses by brokers during Mr. Passman's tenure,including unauthorized or unsuitable trading for customers,say people familiar with the civil probe. Neither the branchnor Mr. Passman, who has run the 120-broker office since themid-1980s, has been charged with any wrongdoing. Nor hasanyone linked Mr. Passman's resignation with theinvestigation.</LP><TEXT>   Wall Street has closely followed the Big Boardinvestigation. The office is said to be one of the mostsuccessful and aggressive brokerage operations in the nation;it is known on Wall Street for its pioneering role in usingtelephone &quot;cold calling&quot; techniques to sell stocks. It is oneof eight retail brokerage offices acquired in 1984 whenShearson, now a unit of American Express Co., purchased theLehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc. investment bank.   (The ex-Lehman branches, while owned by Shearson, stillproudly refer to themselves as &quot;Lehman Brothers&quot; offices. Thereference is unrelated to Shearson's recent renaming of itsinvestment banking and trading operations as its LehmanBrothers division.)   Mr. Passman, 57 years old, didn't return phone messages athis office and forwarded through Shearson. People at Shearsonsaid Mr. Passman is expected to continue with the firm as abroker in Florida, where he just finished building a house.   A Shearson spokesman confirmed Mr. Passman's retirement asbranch manager, but wouldn't comment about the investigationat 55 Water St.   A spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange yesterday saidthat as a matter of policy, it doesn't comment on regulatoryissues. The Securities and Exchange Commission's New Yorkoffice is reviewing the situation and could file its owncharges, people involved in the case say. The SEC declined tocomment on whether it is investigating the 55 Water St.office.   Shearson said Mr. Passman will be succeeded as branchmanager by Robert Tarlowe, who had been the officer in chargeof the eight Lehman retail offices.   Lehman Brothers, starting in pre-Shearson days, has becomewell-known on Wall Street for elevating cold calling to anart form. Using carefully crafted scripts, Lehman brokersconcentrate on making unsolicited phone calls to the nation'swealthiest investors. In fact, the 55 Water St. office couldbe one of the most productive in the nation, industryexecutives suggest. Shearson has acknowledged that the Lehmanbrokers are aggressive, but says it has &quot;strict controls overcold calling, and anyone who doesn't abide by them isdisciplined, or terminated in some cases.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
