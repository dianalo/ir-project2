 The most successful companies in the coming decade willbe those that effectively implement an open office automation (OA)architecture, one that can draw information from the wealth of resources bothinside and outside a company.andP;  By cutting costs and providing a competitiveadvantage, an integrated OA architecture provides the potential for aremarkably high return on investment in the 1990s.andM;A new generation of OA products will be based on client/server computing andwill provide such facilities as electronic data interchange (EDI) and theX.400 electronic mail standard to improve communications.andP;  These technologieswill extend office automation beyond the walls of the corporation, aspurchase orders, invoices and payments are exchanged in digital format aspart of the normal course of a workday.andM;By relying primarily on client/server architectures, an OA architecture willallow any desktop device to access information anywhere in the world via awide area network.andP;  The company with an integrated office system will haveready access to all data affecting any transaction, allowing it to build aservice organization that can respond quickly by developing applications andservices that evolve out of customer needs.andM;But in addition to creating an environment that can distribute moreinformation across the corporation, MIS managers will also derive direct costsavings from moving their company's office automation systems to aclient/server architecture.andM;According to a study by the Gartner Group, a market research company based inStamford, Conn., the savings created by a client/server OA architecture isdue primarily to the server's ability to handle more desktop workstations orpersonal computers than can traditional computing techniques.andP;  When a desktopsystem uses its own CPU power to generate query requests, sort data orperform other functions, it relieves the larger machine of that processingburden.andP;  According to the study, a single server can support from five toseven times as many PCs when it employs a client/server model.andM;In short, an integrated office automation system makes better use of theprocessing power available on the desk top, power that largely goes to wastewhen a PC is connected to a server in terminal emulation mode.andP;  For example,the Gartner Group survey found that managers of OA systems with many userscan save as much as 79 percent by moving to DEC's client/server-basedAll-in-1 Phase II, because of the lower cost per user for servers.andP;  (See&quot;Cost per User for All-in-1 Servers,&quot; page 55.)andM;But how much additional office automation software will a company need toprepare for the 1990s?andP;  In some cases, all a company would have to do is adda relatively inexpensive gateway package to an X.400 electronic mailbackbone.andP;  For example, the costs of an OA system including only X.400 mail,shared access to printers and files, and database access comes to $351 peruser for a 100-user system, according to the Gartner Group study.andM;Major savings can be created by this gateway, savings that can be calculatedeasily by seeing how the gateway reduces the amount of time and money spenton preparing and sending hardcopy materials to customers and suppliers bymail and facsimile.andM;X.400's attraction lies in its ability to span several electronic mailsystems, which lets companies maintain investments in existing systems whilestill providing a high level of interoperability between those systems.andP;  BisMackintosh, a business consulting group based in Luton, England, predictsthat international X.400 messaging traffic will increase at a compound annualgrowth rate of 361 percent through 1993, and that the number of electronicmailboxes will increase to 16 million by that year.andP;  (See &quot;ProjectedWorldwide Growth in X.400 Use,&quot; page 58.)andM;The X.400 standard, introduced in 1984, is supported by many vendors and isimplemented by adding gateways that translate the dissimilar formats used bylocal E-mail systems to the X.400 format.andM;Even in-house, implementing X.400 as part of an OA system can result insavings.andP;  According to some studies, an X.400 E-mail system will save as muchas 6 percent of a clerical employee's time, while the cost of implementingsuch a system remains relatively low.andM;Even though X.400 is a standard, like most standards it may appear in avariety of implementations.andP;  So, at worst, a truly universal X.400 connectionwould require a gateway performing minimal translation between two systemsspeaking the same language but a different dialect.andM;These gateways will serve as an enabling technology: Once companies havemastered the relatively simple process of linking interorganizational mailsystems, they'll be more inclined to tackle tougher issues such asincorporating EDI formats into their office automation systems so as to linkthem with their purchasers and suppliers.andM;To date, EDI has not shown the growth rate that many experts have predicted.andO;The number of users and applications is still limited, although as newapplications appear with the advent of third-generation OA products and theX.400 standard, this situation will probably change.andM;Even so, representative examples are demonstrating how EDI implemented withinan OA system can provide a substantial return on investment.andP;  Take the caseof Bergen Brunswig Drug, a $35 billion company in Orange, Calif., which nowsaves more than $1 million a year thanks to its OA/EDI investment, accordingto a recent report in the Birmingham, Ala.-based EDI Executive Newsletter.andM;The company routes EDI purchase orders to about 78 percent of its suppliersand uses EDI to receive about $100 million per month in payments--or roughly38 percent of its accounts receivable.andP;  Some 20 percent of the company'saccounts payable are sent via EDI.andM;Bergen Brunswig calculated its return on investment by analyzing bothelectronic payments and electronic invoicing.andP;  Before implementing EDI,preparing and distributing checks manually cost $27 each ($25 for generationand $2 for transport).andP;  After implementing EDI, the total cost dropped to $8per check ($8 for generation and nothing for transport)--a savings of $19 percheck.andP;  The savings were derived from reduced clerical translation andtranscription as well as by transmitting checks electronically.andP;  Becauseapproximately 200 suppliers receive an average of two checks each per month,the corporation saves $7,600 per month, and $91,200 per year, by using EDI.andM;The savings with EDI invoices were potentially greater.andP;  Manual costs forinvoices came to $2.02 each (80 cents for receiving, 72 cents for keying andmatching, and 50 cents for retention).andP;  Using EDI, costs were reduced to 2cents per invoice, a per-piece savings of $2.andM;To implement EDI, Bergen Brunswig first spent approximately $175,000 in 1984to develop a system for processing EDI payments and invoices on itsmainframe.andP;  The company also needed to invest resources in developingrelationships with and training its EDI partners.andM;Bergen Brunswig estimated that it took approximately three man-months to getup to speed on receiving EDI payments from a trading partner, andapproximately one man-month to get up to speed when it would be sendingpayments via EDI.andM;When EDI is fully integrated into the business processes of a company, thebenefits to customer service can be impressive.andP;  These benefits includedecreased lead times for customer orders, as well as reduced inventory or ajust-in-time delivery system.andM;Although the technical aspects of EDI are fairly straightforward, theorganizational ramifications are complex.andP;  EDI changes the way the companydoes business--both internally and externally--bringing an organization'semployees, vendors and customers into closer relationships than ever before.andM;For example, Bergen Brunswig found that once it began receiving EDI invoices,it could redirect 70 employees from performing data entry to resolvingpurchasing discrepancies.andP;  This allowed it to avoid losing discounts and tonegotiate the best invoice pricing.andP;  Accordingly, EDI will also strengthenties between the company and its customers.andM;STATE OF AUTOMATIONandM;Although some of the pieces needed for a complete client/server-based OAsystem are still missing, companies can begin to implement this approach now.andM;DEC]s All-in-1 Phase II, IBM's OfficeVision and Hewlett-Packard's NewWaveOffice all implement a client/server OA system.andP;  However, some components ofthese developing architectures are still unavailable, and applications thattake full advantage of these architectures' potential can be tagged only as&quot;coming attractions.&quot;andM;Each of these architectures has its own strength.andM;Through IBM's Systems Application Architecture (SAA), OfficeVision has thegreatest access to data of these three systems because most corporateinformation is stored on a mainframe.andP;  However, if an organization's goal isto link disparate systems, SAA could be counterproductive: It's a closedarchitecture that covers only IBM systems, leaving an organization's VAX,Unix and Macintosh systems as islands of automation.andM;The object-oriented approach of HP's NewWave Office offers the potential ofincreasing programmer productivity four to 10 times, thanks to codereusability and NewWave's common libraries and tools.andP;  But HP does not have aparticularly strong presence in commercial environments, and as such does nothave the wealth of applications currently available for IBM and DEC systems.andM;Finally, there is DEC's All-in-1, which has the advantage of being the mostwidely installed OA package today.andP;  And according to prices quoted by allthree vendors.andP;  All-in-1 Phase II is likely to offer the lowest per-user costfor the foreseeable future.andM;Integrated OA systems are often a welcome source of cost-avoidance revenue.andO;A study of aerospace companies, insurance companies and public utilitiesconducted by the New York consulting company Arthur Young estimated thatclerical costs can be reduced by 10 percent through eliminating manual dataconversion activities such as rekeying and integrating files, E-mail and wordprocessing.andM;Other studies have estimated that these activities occupy from 5 percent to10 percent of a worker's time.andP;  Accordingly, the money wasted by an employeeearning a salary of $25,000 per year in porting data from one application toanother would total $1,250 to $2,500 annually.andM;More savings can be calculated when considering the cost of homegrownapplications integration.andP;  The Gartner Group reports that a company couldsave substantially by reducing the time its $40,000-a-year programmers spendwriting complex system application interfaces.andM;Such interfaces take approximately two man-months each, the consultingcompany estimates, which translates to a cost of $6,600 per interface.andP;  Anetworked, integrated office automation solution could conceivably reduce oreven eliminate this cost.andM;The new approaches to traditional tasks that OA allows can also createsavings.andM;For example, an unlimited user license for a text information managementsystem with an All-in-1 interface can be purchased for $25,000.andP;  By managingdocuments as a database, such a system can offer fast payback by using thesystem's search capabilities to update that data as needed.andM;Users have found that an All-in-1 integrated text information managementsystem can reduce the time needed for document searches from days down tominutes, which has saved some companies as much as $1,042 per search(assuming an average user salary of $25,000).andM;BUY NOW OR WAIT?andM;Electronic imaging is one area where companies must decide whether toimplement an integrated office automation system now or wait for furtheradvances in this technology.andM;The core problem is that no one OA product has married all the capabilitiesthat such users require.andP;  Some products support bit-mapped images but do notmanage the work-flow process.andP;  Others support text but not graphics.andP;  Mostsuccessful users of these systems are in the finance and insuranceindustries, which involve image work-flow applications such as loan or claimsprocessing and other activity-intensive tasks.andM;According to the Gartner Group study, productivity gains from the use ofimaging systems range from 20 percent to 70 percent, because imagingeliminates a considerable amount of drudge work--copying and forwarding paperversions or rekeying data into incompatible systems.andM;Therefore, the initial costs of $25,000 to $50,000 for a workstation,software, operating subsystem and scanner can produce return on investmentrather quickly.andM;It is certain that an integrated office system is the path of choice for the1990s.andM;The customer-oriented corporation of the 1990s will depend heavily onvalue-added services provided by an integrated office system to survive inthe global economy that will characterize the coming decade.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
