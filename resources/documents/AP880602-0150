The accusation by Dukakis, the likely Democratic nominee, had nofactual basis and ``was quite openly a capitulation to threats thatblack voters' support would depend on his making such astatement,'' said the South African Broadcasting Corp. in aneditorial.   It was the latest in a wave of attacks by right-wing andmainstream news media on U.S. politicians campaigning to toughensanctions against South Africa.   Several commentators have suggested that South Africans shouldshift attention to Europe and the Far East and abandon hope of anyconstructive U.S. dealings.   A Johannesburg brokerage firm, Davis Borkum Hare, reportedThursday that one proposal in Congress would force the sale of $7billion of U.S.-held shares in South Africa's mining companies. Thereport said U.S. citizens held 14.2 percent of all South Africanmining shares as of Jan. 1.   South Africa has developed ``appropriate counter-strategies'' tocombat the African National Congress guerrilla movement, thebroadcast commentary said. A pro-goverment Johannesburg newspaper,The Citizen, said South Africa ``will be in for a lot of trouble''if the Massachusetts governor becomes president.   ``Dukakis has been easily swayed by the likes of the Rev. JesseJackson and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and he will do everything hecan to try and strangle the South African economy,'' The Citizensaid in an editorial Wednesday.   ``But this son of immigrant parents should know that SouthAfricans have deep-seated roots in this country that go back morethan three centuries and they will not give in to U.S. demands norsubmit to U.S. sanctions,'' it said.   Dukakis has accused South Africa of terrorist acts but has notcalled it a terrorist state, as Jackson has urged him to do.   Tutu, leader of the Anglican church in southern Africa, praisedDukakis during a recent U.S. trip and endorsed sanctions pending inCongress.   Pro-government media have denounced the black cleric, saying hehas no mandate and ignores the harm which sanctions might inflicton blacks.   An accurate assessment of black views on sanctions is difficultto obtain because the 26 million blacks cannot vote in nationalelections or referendums, and public advocacy of sanctions isforbidden under emergency regulations.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate districts, schools and health services.   Business Day, a Johannesburg newspaper reflecting the views ofmoderate business executives, has carried several articlesassailing the U.S. proposals. The sanctions would cut off virtuallyall bilateral economic activity, except for trade in certainstrategic minerals.   The newspaper reported that the proposals include a section thatsays the United States should not provide advice to South Africa inthe event of a nuclear accident.</TEXT></DOC>
