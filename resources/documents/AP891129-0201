(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Convicted killer Dalton Prejean won a stay ofhis midnight execution Wednesday from the U.S. Supreme Court afterspending the day with his family in the state prison's death house.   Prejean, 10 days shy of his 30th birthday, had been scheduled todie in the electric chair for a murder he committed as a teen-ager.   But the Supreme Court granted Prejean's emergency plea, barringhis execution until the justices decide whether they will hear hisformal appeal to set aside his death penalty. No date has been setfor the court's action on the formal appeal.   The Supreme Court had previously turned down three of hisappeals.   He was 17 when he shot Donald Cleveland in the face in 1977after being stopped for driving with a broken tail light. Prejeanhad been freed six months earlier from a juvenile detention centerwhere he served time for killing a taxi driver when he was 14.Cleveland was the only Louisiana state policeman ever murderedwhile on duty.   Prejean would have been the first person executed under the U.S.Supreme Court's June ruling that authorizes executions of peoplewho commit capital crimes while they were 16 or 17.   Prison officials said his mother, wife, son, brother andsister-in-law were among those authorized to visit him.   Prejean, on death row in Louisiana longer than anyone else,would have been the 19th person executed in Louisiana since theSupreme Court upheld the death penalty in 1976. Nationwide, 119people have been put to death.   On Tuesday, Gov. Buddy Roemer rejected a 3-2 Pardon Boardrecommendation that Prejean's life be spared, and the 5th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals denied a ninth stay of execution.   The 5th Circuit said that while Prejean had low intelligence,his intelligence quotient was not low enough to call him retarded.   Death penalty opponents made Prejean's case a national causecelebre, saying he should be spared because he was nearly retarded(an IQ of 76) and because he was so young when he killed thetrooper.   The 5th Circuit, which rejected Prejean's appeal, said he is notretarded under standards of the American Association on MentalRetardation, which sets the threshhold at an IQ of 70.   In the appeals court's 39-page opinion, Chief Judge CharlesClark wrote:   ``To date, 11 different lawyers have represented Prejean in theprocessing of 20 legal proceedings in 6 different courts before 35different judges. The matter is being considered by this panel forthe third time ... It is time to let justice be done.''   The Pardon Board on Monday recommended commuting the deathsentence to life in prison after hearing testimony from Prejean andothers about the killer's childhood abuse at the hands of his aunt,his limited mental ability and his remorse over his killings.   Roemer, however, cited the brutal nature of Cleveland's death,noted that the victim was a uniformed trooper on duty and saidPrejean's sentence met all judicial standards for the death penalty.</TEXT></DOC>
