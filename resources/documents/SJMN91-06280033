However, these are issues which have beenshown to be stubbornly resistant to violent terminology (who is &quot;winning&quot; the&quot;war on drugs&quot;?). Another paradigm is needed, one of cooperation rather thanconfrontation.;   Where there are winners, there must also be losers. When wedeclare war on a problem, there are those in our society who perceive thatthey are going to be losers, and they start fighting back. Why do we need tochoose between spotted owls and jobs? Because someone must be the loser. Whydo we need to use an image of beating Japan in order to spur students tostudy? Because someone must be the loser. Why do we need to argue who isbetter, women who work outside the home or women who work at home? Because,with our current mindset, it is impossible to conceive that there is not abetter and worse, there may just be different.;   There is an alternative. Wecan learn how to work together to solve problems. We can begin to usenon-violent language in our work and play. We can refuse to support people andorganizations, from corporations to civic and religious groups to politicalcandidates, who put down others to advance themselves. And we can stopthinking that America has to &quot;kick butt&quot; in order to be the country we allwant it to be.;   -- Ellen Rosewall; Stanford  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911006  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  346  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, October 6, 199100280033,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
