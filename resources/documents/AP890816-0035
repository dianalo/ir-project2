The regulations, issued Tuesday and effective immediately, putinto effect legislation signed nine months ago by President Reagan.They are designed to minimize political influence on the agency's21-year-old program under which companies owned by blacks,Hispanics, Asians, Indians and economically disadvantaged women aregiven preference in the awarding of government contracts.   Among the changes:   _The director of the program will be a career employee of theagency, rather than a political appointee. SBA Administrator SusanEngeleiter named Erline Patrick, a former staff aide to the SenateSmall Business Committee, to the post.   ``The person in charge will not have to respond as much to thepolitical pressures,'' Patrick said.   _Companies that misrepresent their status as minority-owned willbe subject to stiffer penalties. The maximum fine was increased from$50,000 to $500,000 and the top jail term from five years to 10years.   _For the first time, competitive bidding is required amongminority-owned companies for manufacturing contracts over $5 millionand product and service contracts over $3 million.   _The length of time a company may get special preference waslengthened from seven years to nine years, but companies will beexpected to derive a steadily decreasing percentage of theirrevenues from contracts awarded under the program.   _Owners of eligible companies must have net worth of less than$250,000, excluding equity in their home or business, when theyenter the program. The old standard was $750,000, including home orbusiness equity.   _The agency must rule on applications within 90 days.   Patrick, at a news conference, said about 3,000 companiesparticipate. She said the net worth requirement and the initiationof competitive bidding may discourage new participants, but she saidshe hoped the deadline for decisions would boost participation.   When Congress passed the law last year, Sen. Dale Bumpers,D-Ark., chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, said it wasaimed at preventing the recurrence of Wedtech-type scandals.   Wedtech Corp., a South Bronx military contractor, was awardedmore than $250 million in no-bid contracts in just four years butbecame the subject of five different state and federal criminalinvestigations.   E. Robert Wallach, a San Francisco lawyer and close friend offormer U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese, was convicted earlier thismonth of illegally receiving $425,000 from Wedtech to influencegovernment officials in the company's bids for contracts.   Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., faces trial next month on charges heand his wife illegally accepted cash and jewelry from Wedtech.</TEXT></DOC>
