The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee voted15-2 to approve the nominations of:   _Alfred C. Sikes, assistant secretary of Commerce forcommunications and information. Bush has selected Sikes to becomechairman of the five-member commission.   _Sherrie P. Marshall, a Washington attorney and formerlegislative aide to outgoing FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick.   _Andrew C. Barrett, a member of the Illinois Commerce Commission.   Committee Chairman Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., said heexpected the full Senate to vote on the nominations before theAugust congressional recess, which is scheduled to begin Friday.They were expected to be confirmed easily.   The only committee opposition to the nominees came fromDemocrats Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and Jay Rockefeller of WestVirginia.   Gore said he was sending a ``symbolic signal'' to the WhiteHouse that he didn't believe the new FCC would be an improvement oneight years of ``market-is-supreme'' deregulation during the Reaganadministration.   ``I don't think what the FCC has been doing is in the publicinterest,'' said Gore, who at a confirmation hearing Monday hadchallenged the nominees on what they planned to do about indecentprogramming.   Gore, whose wife, Tipper, has led a grass-roots campaign againstviolent and suggestive lyrics in rock music, on Tuesday reiteratedhis displeasure with Barrett's assertion that, much like illegaldrugs are commonplace in society, a market also exists for indecentradio and TV shows.   Barrett said the FCC's role was to decide ``what the law willallow us to tolerate.''   ``There has been an attitude at the FCC that whatever the marketis, we are going to accept it,'' Gore said Tuesday. ``I hope theywill, if confirmed, not continue what they've been doing over atthe FCC.''   The only outside opposition to the nominations has been fromanti-indecency groups who think the FCC hasn't been tough enough onbroadcast smut and that Bush didn't seek out nominees who were morelikely to take a hard line against indecency.   Hollings, Gore and others hit hard on TV indecency, noting thatuntil Congress stepped in to ban all indecent TV programs in 1988,the FCC had established a ``safe harbor'' for such shows frommidnight to 6 a.m. when children were presumed not to be watching.   Sikes, a former Missouri broadcaster and self-describedmoderate, said he would vigorously attack obscene material on theairwaves, but that the Supreme Court has proscribed much ofCongress' power in the area of free speech and indecency.   The FCC last year tried to implement the 24-hour ban on indecentprogramming, but broadcasters and civil rights groups challenged iton constitutional grounds. A federal appeals court in Januarystayed imposition of the law.   Hollings and other committee members expressed hope thatrelations between the FCC and Congress would improve after lengthybattles with a commission headed by Patrick and his predecessor,Mark S. Fowler.   Major issues the new commission will face include the governmentrole in fostering international competitiveness in areas such ashigh-definition television; further deregulation of the telephoneindustry; re-regulating cable television; and assignment of theairwaves to competing businesses such as cellular telephones anddirect broadcast satellites.</TEXT></DOC>
