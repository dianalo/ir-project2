GM will increase production by running some plants, particularlyfor trucks, on overtime; restoring second shifts at two U.S. plantsand one in Canada; and reopening its closed Framingham, Mass.,assembly plant.   At the three plants where GM had dropped the second shift,workers from both shifts were sharing jobs by alternating betweentwo weeks on layoff and two weeks on the job, GM said.   The Framingham assembly plant, which GM closed abruptly Nov. 30,will reopen May 9 on one shift with 2,000 of its 3,700 workers. Theplant will build the Oldsmobile Cutlass Cierra, but will not resumeproduction of the Chevrolet Celebrity, GM spokeswoman Kathy Tannersaid.   GM will restore the second shift at itsBuick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac Group Lansing assembly plant A-system onApril 11, returning 2,000 people to full-time work. The4,350-worker plants builds the Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais and BuickSkylark.   The second shift at GM's 4,200-worker Van Nuys, Calif., assemblyplant will be restored March 14, bringing 1,900 employees back fulltime. The plant, which GM's only Chevrolet Camaro and PontiacFirebird source, dropped the second shift last week.   GM also will restore the second shift at its Oshawa No. 1 plantin Oshawa, Ontario, bringing back 2,700 laid-off workers on March21. The plant builds the Oldsmobile Cierra and Pontiac 6000.   Meanwhile, GM said it would increase production at its Cadillacplant in the Detroit enclave of Hamtramck by running its singleshift on overtime, adding 4,700 cars between Feb. 20 and June 1.   Cadillac General Manager John Grettenberger said the increasedproduction was necessary because dealers need more of the restyledEldorado coupe and Seville sedans, whose popularity has beenboosted by availability of a new 4.5-liter V-8 engine.</TEXT></DOC>
