Despite feverish efforts by U.S. exchanges to combat thistrend, many industry professionals increasingly have begun toanswer that question in the negative. &quot;What's happening nowis the product of international and global flow of capital,&quot;says Tone Grant, chairman of Chicago-based Refco Inc.&quot;Trading volume on exchanges here will continue to increase.But growth is going to be faster overseas.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   He and others believe that this shift to foreign marketswas inevitable -- the predictable drift of futures-tradingbusiness to its most efficient venues. Mr. Grant's own firmhas certainly been a case in point.   Refco is a futures-trading giant that grew over the lastdecade more or less in tandem with Chicago's two big futuresexchanges. Over the last five years, the firm's manpower andtrading volume have doubled in London and Paris whileremaining constant in Chicago, Mr. Grant says.   The reasons include the dollar's decline as the world'sbenchmark currency; the increasing sophistication of foreignmarket users, who now have a wealth of choices outside theU.S.; innovation and aggressive marketing at foreignexchanges; and such simple barriers as time zones.   Though executives at U.S. futures exchanges are right whenthey say foreign exchanges are co-opting technology theypioneered, many now think this was unavoidable. &quot;When youhave 100% of a market, there's only one thing that can happento your market share, and that's go down,&quot; says Jack Wing,chairman of Chicago Corp., a financial firm with a bigfutures-trading operation.   The city of Chicago has always been the mainstay of U.S.futures trading. The industry's genesis was this Midwesterncity's innovative use of futures contracts to establishprices for agricultural products -- a role born of Chicago'sstatus as &quot;stacker of wheat&quot; and &quot;hog butcher for the world,&quot;as poet Carl Sandburg put it.   Then, over the last 15 years, Chicago's big exchangesrevolutionized their industry by pioneering financial futurescontracts -- instruments that track the values of bonds,currencies and stocks. Banks, corporations and securitiesfirms discovered what farmers had known for decades: thatfutures contracts -- commitments to deliver commodities orsecurities at some date in the future -- could be used to layoff financial risk and make money.   In one way, the erosion of U.S. market share merelycontinues the evolution of these financial futures contracts.Some of the overseas exchanges' most successful contracts arebased on German and French bonds and the Japanese stockmarket.   While U.S. exchanges have taken a stab at luring businessin some of these instruments here, foreign investors arespurning Chicago's efforts to market their countries' ownfinancial instruments.   For instance, the Osaka Securities Exchange offers afutures contract based on the Nikkei stock index that dwarfsa similar contract traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.Osaka's Nikkei futures contract, in fact, is one of thefastest-growing contracts in the world.   &quot;The Japanese investor doesn't use the CME Nikkei contractat all,&quot; says Gaku Nitta, Chicago branch manager forsecurities firm Yamaichi International America Inc. &quot;There'sno necessity, waking up at midnight in Tokyo to trade here.&quot;   The London International Financial Futures Exchange, orLIFFE, now offers an array of successful contracts based onEuropean interest rates. Futures contracts based on Frenchbonds are a huge hit at the Matif exchange in Paris. And twoyears ago, after Germany's first futures exchange opened, thecountry's major banks agreed among themselves to support itby doing a specified amount of their futures trading there.   Business overseas isn't only booming in financial futures,however. Foreign exchanges are also siphoning off business inmore traditional commodities, including some in which theprimary markets are in the U.S.   On the International Petroleum Exchange in London, or IPE,trading volume in its Brent crude-oil futures contracts rose28% to 5,230,892 contracts in 1991 from 4,083,092 a yearearlier. Meanwhile, volume in the world's biggest energyfutures contract -- the New York Mercantile Exchange'scrude-oil contract, widely used as a pricing mechanism forWest Texas Intermediate oil -- dropped 11% to 21,005,867contracts in 1991 from 23,686,897 contracts in 1990.   New York Merc officials say anticipation of the PersianGulf War created extraordinary circumstances in 1990 thatsharply increased demand for oil futures. They take solace inthe fact that 1991 volume was slightly higher than the 1989total of 20.5 million contracts.   Yet executives at companies that serve the industries thattrade crude-oil futures -- producers such as oil companies orrefineries and consumers such as airlines -- think deepermarket forces are at work.   &quot;We tend to see more activity in the derivatives area fromEuropean companies than American companies,&quot; says DavidHammer, a vice president at Phibro Energy Inc., which helpsindustrial users manage their energy costs. &quot;The Europeanstend to be a little more advanced in that regard. And ifthey're hedging against European petroleum products, the IPEcontract is the natural place for the business to go.&quot;   This phenomenon isn't restricted to energy markets.Platinum futures trading exploded in 1991 on the TokyoCommodities Exchange, or TOCOM, up 65% to 5,403,596 contractsin 1991 from 3,269,222 a year earlier. Open interest inplatinum contracts at the TOCOM is now fluctuating nearrecord levels.   Meanwhile, trading in the New York Merc's platinum futurescontract has never really recovered from a 1989 announcementby Ford Motor Co. that it had developed a platinum-freecatalytic converter for automobiles. Until then, platinum'smost widespread industrial use in the U.S. had been to makecatalytic converters. New York Merc platinum futures volumedropped 26% to 604,646 contracts in 1991 from 820,934contracts in 1990.   &quot;The Japanese historically had the most exposure inplatinum, and this has intensified recently,&quot; says JamesRiley, partner in charge of metals trading for J. Aron, thecommodities division of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;Hereeverybody's wedding band is gold; in Japan it's platinum. Alot more physical platinum is traded in Japan than anywhereelse in world. And platinum still is widely used in theJapanese automotive industry. It's natural that theircontract should be bigger.&quot;   Another example is gold options contracts. The BMandamp;Ffutures exchange in Brazil, which opened in 1989, traded7,452,730 gold options in 1991, up 24% from 1990's 6,000,859contracts. Rampant inflation in South and Central Americacreates demand for these contracts; the same inflation keepsusers from the region from trading on the Commodity Exchangeof New York, where gold options volume fell 28% to 1,398,451contracts in 1991 from 1,931,804 in 1990.   &quot;We are seeing business moving off shore,&quot; says JohnDamgard, president of the Futures Industry Association, aninternational trade group. &quot;These days, there are veryhealthy, viable markets overseas. To the extent othercountries used to accept basis risk and come to the U.S.,they're simply doing it less now.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
