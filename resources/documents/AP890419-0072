WILSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa flashed the victorysign as he arrived today to meet with countryman Pope John Paul IIand seek Western aid for Poland in the wake of the historicreconcilation with his government.   The pope, speaking to a group of Polish pilgrims at his generalaudience, hailed the accords legalizing Walesa's mass labormovement. He offered prayers to the Madonna of Jasna Gora, Poland'sholiest shrine, so that all Poles will have the ``courage, wisdomand calm'' to forge Poland's new course.   Leaders of Italy's three main trade unions met Walesa at Rome'sLeonardo da Vinci Airport along with the ambassador, Josef Wiejacz,who presented Walesa with a bouquet of red and white roses, thecolors of Poland.   Noting the presence of the ambassador, Walesa said, ``This is asign of the accord and should be a good sign so that we can goforward together.''   The Italian trip came a day after Walesa held a symbolicreconciliation with Poland's leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, whodeclared martial law in December 1981 to crush the Solidarity labormovement.   Walesa will meet John Paul on Thursday and also will meet withthe Italian president, premier and foreign minister during histhree-day stay. Walesa is expected to ask for aid to help rebuildPoland's battered economy.   On Monday, a court in Warsaw restored the legal status ofSolidarity after a seven-year ban.   ``For this victory to be complete, we now have to take care ofreal issues and to get down to work together,'' the gray-suitedWalesa told a throng of journalists and well-wishers at the airporttoday.   Walesa flew in on a LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw,accompanied by his wife, Danuta, and the Roman Catholic bishop ofGdansk, Tadeusz Goclowski.   It was a triumphal return for Walesa, who last visited Rome inJanuary 1981, in Solidarity's heyday, when the pope gave his warmendorsement to Solidarity, the first independent labor movement inthe Soviet bloc. The two men met again in 1983 and 1987 duringpilgrimages by John Paul to his homeland.</TEXT></DOC>
