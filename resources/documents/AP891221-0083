SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush's nighttime airlift ofthousands of soldiers to a battle zone in Panama was ahere-and-now, guns and planes example of what some Pentagonplanners see as ``the Army of the future.''   With the Pentagon facing likely budget restraints in the comingyears _ and with a declining Soviet threat suggesting deep troopreductions in Europe _ senior Army planners have proposed thattheir service be molded into a lighter, more flexible fightingforce that can be ordered to hot spots within hours.   Since the Panamanian strike came as Defense Secretary DickCheney was hammering out the Pentagon's five-year budgetprojections, some senior Army officials indicated that the timingcouldn't hurt their cause.   ``We made a decision, and in almost no time at all we wereputting our paratroopers and our Rangers on airplanes and sendingthem down there,'' Army Gen. Tom W. Kelly, the director ofoperations for the Pentagon's Joint Staff, told reporters onWednesday.   ``I don't know that there's another country in the world thatcan do that,'' Kelly said.   There were some advantages in the Panama situation that wouldn'tnecessarily be present in many foreign battle scenes. The Army wasable to do months of on-the-scene planning in Panama and link upwith an established fighting force of some 13,000 soldiers, sailorsand helicopter gunship pilots already based there.   As well, commanders could count on cooperation from the AirForce, Navy and Marines. The Army would like to plan on that in thefuture, but the past has shown that service rivalries can make formessy military operations.   Some of the ideas for revamping the Army were first put forwardthis year by the Army chief of staff, Gen. Carl Vuono. That was ina ``white paper'' that envisioned a pared-down force that wouldrely more on air assault, light infantry and mechanized units _ thevery mix that was used in the Panamanian operation.   ``The Army of the future is one that is versatile ... an Armythat can be forward deployed ... albeit at smaller numbers, an Armythat has a contingency package that can go worldwide, an Army thathas a mix of heavy, light and special operations forces,'' Vuonotold reporters in October.   Army plans envision slashing the current 764,000-strong force to630,000 by 1994, Army sources have said.   Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan, the Army's deputy chief of staff foroperations and plans, predicted in an interview last week that by1995-96, ``you'll see more (of the nation's forces) in thecontinental U.S.,'' but that those soldiers will be ``capable ofresponding to any contingency.''   Sullivan added that while the Army is preparing for the future,its leaders are determined not to repeat what they consider themistakes of the past _ such as the post-World War II draw-downsthat caught the military off guard at the break out of the KoreanWar.   While America's new military will be a smaller fighting force,he said it should be trained to take on new roles and be preparedto fight in Third World arenas, battle the nation's drug scourge orhelp deal with such disasters as Hurricane Hugo and the SanFrancisco-area earthquake.   ``The Army must maintain its relevance to respond to variousrequirements,'' Sullivan said.   The planning officer said he is confident that the Army ``hasthe structure to be able to respond to change,'' even though thechallenges of the future ``may be difficult to see'' at this time.   ``We know where we're going and we know what we should look likewhen we get there,'' he said.   Army officers familiar with Vuono's plans walked the Pentagon'shalls with smiles on their faces after the Panama intervention,touting the strike as an example of their future fighting force,even if it is a smaller one.   ``Versatile, deployable, lethal,'' chanted one Army colonel _using the three catchwords that define the force's new proposals.   ``Eighteen hours from stand to start _ it's the Army of thefuture,'' said an Army general of the time required for thePanamanian deployment.   Another colonel pointed to the complex effort involved inferrying troops from both East and West U.S. coasts and droppingsome 3,000 paratroopers from 1,200 feet in the air, so that theycould team up with mechanized units and helicopters that had beenmoved into Panama in advance.   ``There wasn't one life lost in that nighttime parachute drop _in World War II, they expected to lose between 10 to 15 percent oftheir men,'' one officer said.</TEXT></DOC>
