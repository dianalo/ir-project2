Here the authormentions only some of the factors that might influence the increasedusage of these enhanced tubes. In using more efficient tubing in a heatexchanger the designer has available the options to increase the totalheat duty per unit volume, lower operating costs by reducing the meantemperature difference at a given heat duty, save material, or reducethe size and/or pumping power, among others. This can be achieved, forexample, by replacing plain tubes with appropriate enhanced tubes inretubing applications, where old heat exchangers need to be upgradedand total efficiency improved. When a new heat exchanger is to be built,it is easier for the designer to include the more efficient tubing toutilize all the benefits of the increased thermal performance.</TEXT></DOC>
