(Open SystemsInterconnection)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Cox, John.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Jeffrey Horn and David Passmore, of the consulting firm of NetworkStrategies, suggest that users who plan to migrate fromproprietary to standards-based networks should develop a backbonenetwork compatible with the OSI model.andP;  An OSI backbone providesthe physical interconnections necessary to support OSI-compliantproducts and applications.andP;  The OSI seven-layer model lets userscreate a standard network environment, eliminating dependence on asingle vendor.andP;  Users can choose from several migration paths:standard IEEE 802.X local network topologies to interconnectnearby local area networks (LANs) to the OSI backbone; standardCCITT X.25 packet-switched networks for wide-area connections; oruse bridges or routers to connect devices and LANs.andP;  The benefitsof a single backbone network include cost savings, simplified andimproved network management and adding new features is easier.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Network Strategies Inc.
