DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prosecutors insisted Friday that Ivan F. Boeskygot a fair punishment for his crimes, despite the convictedspeculator's plea for more leniency from a judge who sentenced himto three years imprisonment.   Boesky, the disgraced stock speculator at the center of a majorinsider trading scandal, asked U.S. District Judge Morris Laskerlate last week to reduce his sentence for conspiracy to violatesecurities law.   Boesky, who could have been sentenced to a maximum five years,said through his lawyers that he deserves milder treatment becausehe has provided prosecutors with additional evidence on ``newtopics, new transactions, new relationships and new securities.''   That disclosure indicated Boesky is now giving evidence aboutpeople he hadn't implicated in earlier statements to prosecutorsbefore his sentencing.   Lasker sentenced Boesky in December. The speculator beganserving his sentence at a minimum security prison at Lompoc, Calif.last month and will be eligible for parole after one year.   In a two-page affidavit responding to Boesky's request,Assistant U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll said Boesky is continuingto cooperate and ``the government's investigations relating toinformation he has provided continues.''   But Carrol also maintained that ``in the government's view,Boesky's three-year sentence was and remains an appropriatesentence in light of all the competing factors.''   In his 35-page affidavit requesting sentence reduction, Boeskylawyer Leon Silverman asked Lasker to delay ruling until October,by which time ``the extraordinary extent and value of Mr. Boesky'scooperation will become even more evident.''   Carrol also agreed that Lasker should delay ruling until October.   Boesky was a leading speculator in the stocks of potentialtakeover targets when he rocked Wall Street in November 1986 byagreeing to pay $100 million to settle civil insider tradingcharges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.   In addition to settling the civil case without admitting guilt,Boesky also agreed to plead guilty to the single felony count andhas been cooperating since then with prosecutors.</TEXT></DOC>
