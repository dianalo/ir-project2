Sesit (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDA </CO><IN> MON FRX PCS CMD </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Many forecasters expect the dollar to tumble to new lows against the yen and to near its lows against the mark next year -- regardless of who is elected president of the U.S. tomorrow.    For much of last week, traders succeeded in pushing the dollar lower despite intervention by U.S. and Japanese central banks. Then on Friday, the dollar shot up when the Labor Department announced U.S. civilian unemployment in October fell to 5.3%, tying a 14-year low.    However, much of that advance was attributed to traders scrambling to buy back dollars to cover short positions that had been built up in expectation of the currency's continued decline. Late Friday, the dollar retreated from its earlier highs.    &quot;The market remains bearish on the dollar, long term,&quot; says Geoffrey E.J. Dennis, chief economist at the New York unit of James Capel andamp; Co. &quot;After the election, it's a whole new ball game in every sense; everything is up for grabs.&quot;    He and others expect a combination of the persistently large U.S. trade and budget deficits to keep the dollar on a downward path, even if the latest employment data indicate the economy might not be slowing as much as some believed.    &quot;This may change the timing slightly -- maybe it won't go down as quickly after the {U.S.} election as some thought -- but this isn't going to change things,&quot; says Richard Witten, a vice president at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.    The dollar reached record intraday trading lows of 120.25 yen and 1.5630 marks in early January.    In late Friday trading in New York, the dollar stood at 1.7893 marks and 124.98 yen, up from 1.7789 marks and 124.58 yen Thursday. The pound fell to $1.7675 from $1.7768 the previous day.    In Tokyo on Monday, the dollar opened at 125.28 yen, up from Friday's close of 124.63 yen.    For years, Americans greeted exchange-rate news with a yawn -- but no more. Because of huge trade and budget deficits that have built up during the past several years, the dollar's value has a direct effect on U.S. jobs, industrial competitiveness and interest rates.    &quot;A weaker dollar means faster growth, better exports and a lower budget deficit as that faster growth contributes to higher {corporate} revenues and tax payments,&quot; says David F. Lomax, group economic adviser at National Westminster Bank PLC in London.    But there are also risks. Too steep a fall can mean higher inflation and eventually higher interest rates. A lower dollar also makes it cheaper for foreigners to buy U.S. assets -- everything from stocks and bonds to real estate and corporations.    All summer long, the dollar was the darling of the foreign-exchange market. But since the end of September, it has fallen 7% against the yen, 4% against the mark and 4% against the pound.    After tomorrow's election, &quot;The market will wait for signals of what a new {U.S.} administration might do,&quot; says Mark J. Rosasco, vice president in charge of Citibank's New York foreign-exchange operations. Mr. Rosasco warns that the honeymoon could end abruptly.    &quot;Barring any improvement in the fundamentals, it's going to end with new pressure on the dollar,&quot; he says. &quot;By the end of the first quarter, we've got to see something fundamental from the administration and Congress about the twin {budget and trade} deficits.&quot; If not, the dollar will be trading six months from now in a lower range of 100 to 115 yen and 1.55 to 1.70 marks, Mr. Rosasco predicts.    Crucial to the dollar's future value is the market's assessment of how much its level against other currencies is helping reduce the U.S. trade deficit and Japan's and West Germany's surpluses, says John Lipsky, a Salomon Brothers Inc. director.    &quot;The market senses that {U.S.} trade improvement is, at very best, happening very slowly and at worst stalled,&quot; says Mr. Dennis of James Capel.    After two years of substantial declines, the dollar appears likely to end 1988 close to where it opened in January. Some analysts say this shows the markets haven't decided whether current exchange rates can reduce the trade imbalances.    Nonetheless, the case for a lower dollar remains strong in the view of many analysts, as the outlook for U.S. economic growth remains cloudy at best. Despite Friday's strong employment report, for instance, U.S. gross national product growth slowed to a 2.2% annual pace in the third quarter from rates of 3% in the second quarter and 3.4% in the first quarter.    &quot;The most disturbing feature isn't that the U.S. economy is slowing, but that exports stopped growing faster than imports,&quot; Mr. Lomax of National Westminster says. &quot;That means the balance of payments has stopped improving.&quot;    Mr. Lomax says U.S. domestic expansion is bound to slow, and that, &quot;to avoid recession, exports have to continue to expand, and that means a competitive dollar.&quot; As far as exporters are concerned, &quot;competitive&quot; generally means &quot;lower.&quot;    Noting that U.S. import prices fell in the third quarter after rising through 1986 and 1987 and in the first half of 1988, Michael Moran, chief economist for the U.S. unit of Daiwa Securities Co., says: &quot;That's a signal that foreign producers want to retain or capture market share in the U.S.; so the dollar has to move to a position such that it forces foreign producers to raise prices and slow our imports.&quot;    Many market-watchers say they believe the major industrial nations won't stand in the way of a falling dollar after tomorrow. &quot;I don't think the central banks will be nearly as vehement about defending currency rates after the election,&quot; says Mr. Witten of Goldman Sachs. &quot;G-7 is conducting a managed retreat.&quot;    The Group of Seven, or G-7, consists of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. For nearly two years, central banks and top officials of these countries have used a combination of intervention, interest-rate maneuvering and jawboning to keep the dollar within a secret trading range. The range is believed to have been a wide 1.60 to 1.90 marks and 120 to 140 yen.    Another concern is foreign private investors' appetite for dollar-denominated securities. So far, these investors have surprised many who at the start of this year predicted a wholesale retreat from U.S. securities markets.    But many of Japan's big life insurance companies have purchased about 70% of the U.S. bonds they planned to buy in the fiscal year ending March 31, according to some Tokyo watchers. So, &quot;in the months ahead, we may see fewer purchases from them,&quot; says Mr. Moran of Daiwa.    Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. is currently &quot;on the sidelines because of the dollar,&quot; said Shigeki Nihei, a vice president. He doesn't expect substantial dollar weakness after the election, but he concedes: &quot;The problem is we are not in the majority; most of the Japanese firms are very bearish on the dollar.&quot;    Not everyone buys the death-of-the-dollar thesis. While not ruling out that the U.S. currency could decline over time, Mr. Lipsky of Salomon says he thinks the jury is still out. He argues that Friday's unemployment figures undermined the thesis of a sharply slowing economy. He also says: &quot;The authorities mean what they say -- that they will not stand aside and let currencies reach new lows, post-election.&quot;    Mr. Lipsky expects September U.S. trade figures, to be released Nov. 16, to show a narrowing deficit. He says the U.S. budgetary process is &quot;sufficiently diffuse&quot; to cause the market to think twice about bashing the dollar too hard too soon.    Nonetheless, by the end of 1989, James Capel sees the dollar trading at about 110 yen, roughly 12% below current levels, and at 1.62 marks, down 9%. The firm sees the pound at $1.90, which would represent a 7% slide for the dollar. Others aren't so pessimistic. Mr. Witten of Goldman Sachs sees the dollar at 118 to 123 yen, a bit lower than its current level, and 1.75 to 1.80 marks, within its current range.    Mr. Rosasco of Citibank agrees. &quot;A year from now, we're going to be back where we started,&quot; he says. &quot;The long-term money is all hedged.&quot; That means that a significant number of those who might want to sell dollars already have.    &quot;We can go for a long, long time running substantial current-account deficits before you build up such a new, large, unhedged dollar overhang that we are in uncharted territory,&quot; says Mr. Rosasco.    On New York's Commodity Exchange Friday, current-delivery gold was unchanged at $421.50 an ounce. Estimated volume was 3.6 million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Monday, gold was quoted at $423.50 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
