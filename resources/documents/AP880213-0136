(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican presidential candiate PatRobertson has canceled interviews and ducked questions when askedto back up anecdotes he's told, including one about a woman whocaught AIDS by kissing her impotent husband, a newspaper reportedSaturday.   The Concord Monitor said the former television evangelist alsohas failed to document assertions he knows a little girl inPittsburgh whose reading level soared from second to seventh gradein 20 days under a money-saving program to improve reading skills.   The newspaper said it has asked Robertson and his staff fordocumentation, but details have not been produced and interviewshave been canceled.   The newspaper said it asked for details after an AIDS expert,concerned with Robertson's remarks, said acquired immune deficiencysyndrome is spread through sex, blood or needles and mother toinfant.   Robertson said Saturday the story about the woman catching AIDS``was a news story gathered by our news department.''   ``It was strictly off the wire reports but was gathered when wedid a series on my television program dealing with this subject,''Robertson said.   Robertson's staff has not identified the girl whom the candidatehas cited as an example of an inexpensive method of improvingchildren's reading skills, the Monitor said.   All of the stories are ``verifiable,'' Robertson said. ``We gavethem the names of who to check. Every one of them is true.''   ``Three weeks ago, the Monitor asked for documentation of theAIDS case, the account of the little girl and two other anecdotesRobertson has used in interviews,'' the newspaper said.   ``Aides offered names of people they believed could substantiatetwo of the anecdotes; at best, their comments offered partialsupport. In the other two instances, the staff provided nodocumentation, and people contacted by the Monitor said the storieswere unlikely.   ``Initially, staff members said they would respond to theMonitor's request for documentation. Last week, they recommendedasking Robertson himself. Campaign aides arranged two interviewsthis week; both were canceled.   ``Stopped in an elevator in the Statehouse on Thursday,Robertson said, `I haven't got time for that, really. That'sbackground.'   ``Robertson missed a third interview, by telephone, arranged byhis staff for later Thursday night,'' the newspaper said.   The newspaper said that Friday, Marc Nuttle, Robertson'scampaign manager, said the examples were taken from segments of the700 Club, a program on Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network,but he did not know how producers who worked on the stories couldbe reached.   Regarding AIDS by a kiss, the Monitor quoted Robertson at from aDecember news conference: ``I know one man who was impotent whogave AIDS to his wife and the only thing they did was kiss.''   ``In an earlier interview with the Monitor, Robertson said thatif a person is `in a room with 25 people with AIDS and they'rebreathing various things into the atmosphere, the chance ofsomebody catching it has become quite strong,' '' the newspapersaid.   The Monitor said Scott Hatch, a spokesman for Robertson, saidthat information was taken from a British medical report, ``whichhe said he sent to the Monitor by overnight mail about a week ago.It did not arrive.''</TEXT></DOC>
