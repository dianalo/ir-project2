This study examines simultaneouslythe nitrogen trends in all the various pools (trees, weeds, soil, andsoil water). The N trends and fertilization rates are compared with leafN status and tree growth on two soil types over 5 years. The data showa gradual transition from an early herbaceous plant-dominated systemto a tree-dominated system later in the rotation. On the more fertilesite, fertilization was not beneficial to tree growth the first yearor even the second, if all weeds were kept out. However, when weeds werepresent, fertilization was very beneficial to tree growth in the secondand third years. After crown closure, fertilization declined in importanceas herbaceous vegetation was eliminated, tree foliage biomass stabilized,and N cycling increased. Foliar N was strongly related to fertilizerrate during years 2 and 3 on the fertile site and during the entire 5years on the infertile site. From these relations and others are inferredthe possible critical times for N fertilization during the first 5 yearsof a rapidly growing hybrid poplar plantation from the time of initialplanting through complete canopy closure and shading out of the herbaceouscompetition. 22 refs., 6 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
