<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-32-0984 </DOCNO><TEXT>A series of high vitrinite coal samples containing 69 to 89% C (daf),are subjected to non-reductive O- and C-alkylation procedures with theaim of eliminating the donor-acceptor bonding and enhancing the solubility.The dependence of solubility in THF of the coals alkylated after thetwo ways is determined with respect to coal carbon content. Data forthe ratio of the molecular (mobile) and macromolecular (valent cross-linked)structural 'phases' of the coals of different rank are obtained on thebasis of the experimental results. 11 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
