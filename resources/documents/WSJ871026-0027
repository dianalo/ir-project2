Schlesinger and Gary LamphierStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CANDA LABOR GMAUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><TEXT>   Auto workers in the U.S. and Canada overwhelmingly approved separate new three-year contracts with General Motors Corp. The pacts, which came without strikes, conclude a round of unusual labor quiet for the North American auto industry this year.    GM workers in the U.S. backed their pact with 81% support. That total surpasses the 73% worker endorsement for the agreement reached last month at Ford Motor Co., after which the GM contract was patterned. It also far exceeds the level of rank-and-file enthusiasm for the past two GM contracts, which got less than 60% worker approval. Chrysler Corp.'s U.S. contract doesn't expire until next year.    The auto workers in Canada voted 89% for their GM contract. That roughly matches support for accords reached earlier at Chrysler and Ford's Canadian units.    The ratifications mean that the only walkout in either country this fall was a brief six-day work stoppage in September at Chrysler's Canadian plants.    Meanwhile, GM also announced a peaceful agreement on a new three-year contract with the International Union of Electronic Workers, which represents 24,000 workers at nine plants. Terms weren't disclosed.    The United Auto Workers pact covers about 335,000 workers at more than 150 facilities. The Canadian Auto Workers pact covers about 40,000 workers at 13 facilities.    The wide endorsement among GM workers in the U.S. is particularly significant given the high tensions preceding the negotiations. GM made a series of public-relations blunders that rankled its workers, most notably paying executives their regular bonuses while hourly employees failed to qualify for profit-sharing.    If the high rank-and-file backing is an indication of underlying good will, it could bode well for GM in the coming years. This contract, more than previous ones, is a &quot;living document,&quot; where the execution depends a great deal on how well the two sides work together.    Specifically, GM is hoping to get major productivity and quality improvements out of special committees that will be set up at each plant. The committees have to file reports in six months, but don't have to make any changes.    &quot;The margin of victory makes it clear that our members at GM fully understand and appreciate the historic breakthroughs achieved in this agreement,&quot; UAW President Owen Bieber and Vice President Donald F. Ephlin said in a prepared statement after the vote results were released yesterday.    The pact's centerpiece is a job security program that prevents layoffs except during a sales drop, and bans any additional plant closings beyond the 16 GM already has announced. GM also is required to replace half its workers lost through attrition.    Workers will also get a 3% base-wage raise the first year and lump-sum payments equal to 3% of the base wage the last two years. Currently, GM workers make about $13.50 an hour.    But the workers had other reasons for supporting the contract. Many feared that the struggling auto maker would extract pay or job security concessions, particularly from workers in the less competitive parts operations.    The pact reached between General Motors of Canada Ltd. and the Canadian Auto Workers union closely resembles contracts the union reached earlier at Canada's Chrysler and Ford units. Its main element is a six-year pension plan that ties payments to future retirees to inflation, within certain limits.    Under the pact, pensioners will be eligible to receive a maximum monthly payment of 1,875 dollars ($1,423.88) by 1992, compared with 1,205 dollars under the prior contract, which expired Sept. 14. The union believes improved pensions will induce workers to retire. It sees this as a better way to deal with potential auto job losses than U.S.-style job security provisions.    GM Canada, like the other auto units, softened its opposition to inflation-indexed pensions after the union agreed not to seek similar terms for current pensioners, who instead will receive fixed annual increases.    The CAW also won a wage increase for its 40,000 GM Canada members of 3% in the first year and 1.5% in each of the second and third years of the accord. </TEXT></DOC>
