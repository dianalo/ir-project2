It already is widely used in Britain and other countries and hasbeen tried by about 50,000 U.S. women in clinical trials sponsoredby the National Institutes of Health.   The cap, approved Monday, is a flexible, cup-like rubber deviceabout 1{ inches in diameter that is to be fitted by a physician tocover the base of the woman's cervix.   After the initial fitting, the cap can be inserted and removedby the user and can remain in place for 48 hours, as opposed to amaximum of 12 hours for the diaphragm.   Both devices are to be used with a spermicidal cream or jelly,but the cap does not require additional spermicide before eachinstance of intercourse.   The NIH clinical study found the cap to be about 85 percenteffective in preventing pregnancy, comparable to the diaphragm.   The approved labeling to be supplied physicians states the capis to be prescribed only for women with normal Pap tests, which isa test for cervical cancer, and that they are to return for afollow-up Pap test after using the cap for three months.   The labeling also will caution that the cap, like the diaphragmand contraceptive sponge, may slightly increase the risk of toxicshock syndrome.   Unlike the diaphragm, the cervical cap was not widely used inthe United States in 1977, when Congress ordered the FDA tostrengthen its regulation of birth control and other medicaldevices.   Because they were already in extensive use at that time,diaphragms and condoms were given ``grandfather'' FDA approval timewithout the stringent testing subsequently required of new medicaldevices.   The National Women's Health Network, an advocacy group, has beenpushing for approval of the cap since 1978, arguing that it is assafe and effective as the diaphragm and offers advantages that manywomen will find appealing.   Rather than covering the entire roof of the vagina as adiaphragm does, the cap fits over the tip of the cervix and thusallows for more sensitivity during intercourse.</TEXT></DOC>
