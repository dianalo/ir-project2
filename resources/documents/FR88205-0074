Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">[Docket No. CP88-172-000]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">January 29, 1988.</ITAG>Take notice that on January 15, 1988, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee),filed in Docket No. CP88-172-000 an application pursuant to sections 7(b)and 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for (1) authority to abandon 15,000 dekathermsper day (Dth/d) of firm sales service to North Penn Gas Company (NorthPenn); and (2) a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing(a) the sale for resale of up to 40,000 Dth/d, on a firm basis, to PublicService Electric and Gas Company (Public Service); (b) the replacementof Public Service's July 1, 1970, storage service agreement under Tennessee'sSS-E Rate Schedule with a new one extending the term of service and addinga proposed new delivery point to Public service; (c) the amendment of PublicService's November 1, 1968, sales service agreement under Tennessee's CD-5Rate Schedule to add a proposed new delivery point; and (d) the constructionand operation of facilities necessary to effectuate the sale, all as morefully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commissionand open to public inspection.Tennessee states that it requests authority to abandon 15,000 Dth/d offirm sales service to North Penn, at North Penn's request. Tennessee assertsthat the proposed abandonment would be subject to authorization of theproposed new sales to Public Service with the effective date of the proposedabandonment to be the same as the commencement of new service to PublicService.Tennessee further states that due to the need to more efficiently integratethe northern portion of Public Service's service area, as well as to serveprojected increases in market demand in its service area, Public Servicerequested Tennessee to enter into a new gas sales contract for the purchaseof up to 40,000 Dth/d, over and above deliveries under existing contracts,and (2) to construct necessary facilities to effectuate the proposed newdeliveries, as well as portions of existing contractual entitlements ata new delivery point near Northvale, New Jersey.Tennessee proposes to construct 20.1 miles of 30-inch O.D. mainline loopingin the counties of Wyoming and Livingston, New York and Susquehanna, Pennsylvania,install 3,165 horse power of additional compression at the existing BradfordCounty, Pennsylvania compressor station, 8.6 miles of 24-inch O.D. saleslateral and related metering facilities in Bergen County, New Jersey. Tennesseeestimates the total cost of these facilities at $38,698,000.Additionally, Tennessee notes that it would upgrade the maximum allowableoperating pressures (MAOP) of portions of its existing mainline systemfrom the existing level of 975 psig to 1170 psig, a process that requireshydrostatic testing of existing facilities and potentially the replacementof two to three miles of existing pipeline. Tennessee alleges that theseprocedures may be performed under andSection; 2.55 of the Commission's Regulationswithout Commission authority. Tennessee would amend Public Service's existing CD-5 Rate Schedule serviceagreement, dated November 1, 1968, to add the new delivery point near Northvale,New Jersey. Further Tennessee would replace the existing SS-E Rate Scheduleservice agreement, dated July 1, 1970, with Public Service to extend theterm of service and to add the new delivery point. The new SS-E serviceagreement would commence on November 1, 1988, with a primary term lastinguntil November 1, 2000, and then from year to year thereafter. Tennessee proposes to charge Public Service under the new gas sales contractwhich provides for delivery of an additional 40,000 Dth/d at the effectiveCD-5 rate. However, Tennessee states that Public Service has agreed topay an annual incremental facilities charge, if the revenues received byTennessee under the new sales agreement fails to recover the cost of serviceassociated with the Bergen County, New Jersey sales lateral. Under theseprovisions, Tennessee asserts, Public Service has agreed to assume therisk of any underrecovery of revenues attributable to the costs of thenew sales lateral Tennessee might experience, while Tennessee assumes therisk of underrecovery attributable to the mainline expansion. Tennessee also states that, while the new Rate Schedule CD-5 service agreementwill not be an ``eligible firm sales service agreement'' as that term isdefined in andSection; 284.10 of the Commission's Regulations, it has agreedto include provisions which give Public Service the option, in any year,to convert up to 20 percent of the original maximum daily quantity andannual quantity to firm transportation. This conversion option is saidto be subject to Tennessee's receipt of the appropriate abandonment andcertificate authority in a separate proceeding, and to the availabilityof receipt point capacity and comparable rates.
