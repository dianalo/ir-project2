(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 12-year-old boy was charged withsecond-degree rape Tuesday in an alleged attack against his formerbabysitter, a 30-year-old mentally retarded woman who lived nextdoor.   The woman was attacked Sept. 22 at an elementary school acrossfrom her home, said Detective Michael Burris.   The woman, who has cerebral palsy, lives with her 68-year-oldmother, who said she believed that the boy and possibly others inthe neighborhood beat her daughter with a stick, then raped her.   ``Three days before this happened, he (the 12-year-old) asked herfor sex,'' the mother said. ``She knew enough to say `No.' He said,`I'll get you.'''   The boy was arrested Monday. Detectives were investigating themother's belief that other youngsters were involved, Burris said.   Arraignment was scheduled for Wednesday in juvenile court, with adetention review to determine whether the boy should remain incustody.   Burris said the young woman's fear and limited mental capacity,plus a lack of physical evidence, hampered the investigation. Shedid not tell her mother she had been raped until three weeks afterthe alleged attack, the mother said.   The detective said the woman was able to communicate some detailsof the alleged attack, but he wasn't sure whether she would be ableto testify at a trial.   The boy could receive up to seven months in juvenile detention,said Dan Donohoe of the King County prosecutor's office.   The mother said the attack occurred after her daughter went to aconvenience store.   ``She used to baby-sit the boy when he was little. (He) knew shewas mentally retarded,'' the mother said.   She said her daughter had ``two great big goose eggs on her head,and they took a stick and cracked her across the nose. She had blackeyes for two weeks. They beat her legs until her legs were allpulpy.''</TEXT></DOC>
