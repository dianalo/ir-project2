The problem has been presented onthe basis of investigations of surface and underground water qualityin the vicinity of the tip against the background of dynamics of solublesolids leaching from coal mine spoil deposited on the tip and chemicalcomposition of pore solutions in vertical cross-sections of the tip.The results of chemical analyses of pore solutions and effluents fromthe tip as well as investigations of underground and surface water haveproved the negative changes of water quality in consequence of tip impact.3 refs., 2 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
