Superconducting point contact is formed at the touch ofniobium 60 {mu}m diameter needle to the plane surface of niobium 1 mmdiameter pin. Just before the experiment the needle is sharpened by chemicaletching and then is washed in distilled water and alcohol. The furthercontact formation is conducted by fritting technique, which allows toeliminate the conditions for nonstationary noise appearance. Resistanceof the contacts obtained constitutes 100-500 ohm. Fluctuation sensitivityof radiometer is no worse, than 0.01 K.</TEXT></DOC>
