The move to add an additional crude-oil contract and a new crude-product contract is in a preliminary stage. Still, analysts said the need for new energy products isn't great. &quot;There's just too much stuff. I don't think the market can digest it all,&quot; said one analyst, who asked not to be identified.    In confirming that the move was under consideration, Rosemary T. McFadden, exchange president, said the Nymex research department is looking at including sour crude oil and residual, or heavy, fuel. The contracts would &quot;round out&quot; the Nymex's energy complex, she said.    The widely followed crude-oil contract currently traded on the Nymex is light sweet West Texas Intermediate crude, a main U.S. grade.    The Nymex, whose crude-oil, heating-oil and unleaded-gasoline futures contracts have in only a few years become international benchmarks, also is planning to start trading futures on natural gas later this year. A propane futures contract introduced last year so far has been weak. </TEXT></DOC>
