The new temporaryregulations implement section 1060 of the Code. Section 1060 was addedto the Code by section 641 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. No. 99-514;100 Stat. 2282).<ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Provisions</ITAG>IntroductionFor tax purposes, the sale of a going trade or business for a lump sumamount is viewed as a sale of each individual asset rather than a singlecapital asset. Both the purchaser and the seller must allocate the purchaseprice for the acquisition among the assets transferred. The seller mustallocate the purchase price among the assets to determine the amount andcharacter of its realized gain or loss on the sale. The purchaser's allocationdetermines its basis in each asset and will affect its amount of allowabledepreciation, cost depletion, or amortization deductions, its realizedgain or loss on a subsequent sale of those assets, and may have other taxconsequences.Section 1060(a) provides that, in the case of an applicable asset acquisition,the seller and the purchaser each must allocate the consideration amongthe assets transferred in the same manner as the amounts are allocatedunder section 338(b)(5) (relating to certain stock purchases treated asasset acquisitions). Thus, the seller and the purchaser are required toallocate consideration under the residual method in order to make the respectivedeterminations of the amount of gain or loss from the transfer of eachasset and the basis in each asset acquired.Prior to the enactment of section 1060, there was considerable controversybetween taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service concerning the allocationof the purchase price among assets of a going business. The controversyprincipally was due to the difficulty in establishing the value of goodwilland going concern value. Section 1060, by mandating the application ofthe residual method of allocation as prescribed in the regulations undersection 338(b)(5), alleviates this controversy since the residual methoddoes not require a separate determination of the value of goodwill andgoing concern value. Instead, under the residual method any ``premium''paid in excess of the total fair market value of the purchased assets (otherthan goodwill or going concern value) is treated as payment for goodwillor going concern value. The mandatory application of the residual methodof allocation also eliminates disparities in purchase price allocationsthat existed, prior to the enactment of section 1060, between asset purchasesand stock purchases treated as asset purchases under section 338.Section 1060(b) requires the seller and the purchaser to report certaininformation in connection with an applicable asset acquisition. The informationreporting requirements are intended to encourage compliance with the substantiverules of section 1060 and to assist the Internal Revenue Service in identifyingreturns which are likely to involve an attempt to amortize goodwill orgoing concern value.The temporary regulations define the term ``applicable asset acquisition,''provide rules for allocating consideration under the residual method amongthe assets transferred (including increases or decreases in considerationoccurring after the purchase date), and implement the reporting requirementsof section 1060(b).Applicable Asset AcquisitionAn ``applicable asset acquisition'' is any transfer, whether direct orindirect, or a group of assets constituting a trade or business with respectto which the purchaser's basis is determined wholly by reference to theconsideration paid for the assets. (However, a transfer does not fail tobe an applicable asset acquisition solely because section 1031 (relatingto like-kind exchanges) applies to a portion of the assets.) Under andSection;1.1060-1T(b), a group of assets constitutes a trade or business if theuse of such assets would constitute an active trade or business for purposesof section 355 or if their character is such that goodwill or going concernvalue could under any circumstances attach to such assets. A group of assetswhich constitutes a trade or business in the hands of the seller or thepurchaser will constitute a trade or business for purposes of section 1060.Thus, for example, a purchaser cannot avoid the application of section1060 by arguing that he will not use the assets of an acquired businessin the same business. All the facts and circumstances surrounding the transactionare taken into account in determining whether a group of assets constitutesa trade or business. Factors to be considered include related transactionsbetween the purchaser and seller such as a lease agreement, covenant notto compete, management contract, or other similar agreement between purchaserand seller (or managers, directors, owners, or employees of the seller);and the excess, if any, of the total consideration over the aggregate bookvalue of the tangible and intangible assets (other than goodwill and goingconcern value) as shown in the purchaser's financial accounting books andrecords.The temporary regulations provide rules for the allocation of considerationwhen a portion of the group of assets, which constitutes a trade or businessunder section 1060, is exchanged for other assets in a transaction to whichsection 1031 applies. The like-kind property and other property or moneywhich is treated as transferred in exchange for the like-kind propertyare excluded from the allocation rules of section 1060. The temporary regulationsinclude rules for determining the amount of the other property or moneywhich is treated as transferred in exchange for the like-kind property.A conforming amendment (new andSection; 1.1031(d)-1T) is made to the section1031 regulations. When finalized, the new paragraph will follow andSection;1.1031(d)-1(e). Rules relating to the transfer of a partnership interestare prescribed in new andSection; 1.755-2T.Allocation of ConsiderationSection 1.1060-1T (d) and (e) prescribes the method by which the sellerand purchaser must allocate consideration among the assets transferred.The method of allocation is substantially the same as the method of allocationprescribed in andSection; 1.338(b)-2T (relating to the allocation of adjustedgrossed-up basis among the assets of the target corporation when a section338 election is made).Section 1.1060-1T(d) identifies four classes of assets, which are identicalto the four classes of assets identified in andSection; 1.338(b)-2T. ``ClassI assets'' are cash, deposits in banks, and similar items. ``Class II assets''are certificates of deposit, U.S. government securities, certain marketablestocks and securities, foreign currency, and similar items. ``Class IVassets'' are intangible assets in the nature of goodwill and going concernvalue. All assets not described above, specifically including accountsreceivable, are ``Class III assets.'' As a general rule, a proportionatemethod of allocation is prescribed for the allocation of considerationwithin each class of assets, although a residual method of allocation isprescribed for allocation among the asset classes, allocation beginningwith the lowest numbered class. After consideration is reduced by the amountof Class I assets, it is allocated among Class II assets in proportionto their fair market values as of the purchase date, and then among ClassIII assets in such proportion, and finally to Class IV assets. Thus, considerationis allocated within each of asset classes II and III to the extent of thefair market value of the assets in that class, with any remaining amountallocated to the next class of assets. The unallocated amount of considerationremaining after allocation among the Class III assets is allocated to ClassIV assets, intangible assets in the nature of goodwill and going concernvalue.The amount of consideration allocated to an asset, other than assets inthe nature of goodwill and going concern value, cannot exceed its fairmarket value on the purchase date. The ``fair market value'' of an assetis its fair market value determined without regard to mortgages, liens,pledges, or other liabilities. However, the amounts assigned as fair marketvalues by the seller, but not the purchaser, are subject to rules similarto section 7701(g) (relating to fair market value in the case of propertysubject to nonrecourse indebtedness).The amount of consideration allocated to an asset is also subject to anyapplicable limitations under the Code or general principles of tax law.Thus, for example, the amount of the consideration allocated by a purchaserto a player contract described in section 1056 cannot exceed the limitationimposed by that section.In connection with the examination of a return, the Internal Revenue Servicemay challenge the taxpayer's determination of the fair market value ofany asset by any appropriate method and take into account all factors,including any lack of adverse tax interests between the parties. For example,in certain cases the Internal Revenue Service may make an independent showingof the value of goodwill and going concern value as a means of callinginto question the validity of the taxpayer's valuation of other assets.Subsequent Adjustments to ConsiderationSection 1.1060-1T(f) provides rules for the allocation of increases ordecreases in consideration of either the purchaser or seller that occurafter the purchase date. Increases in consideration are allocated amongthe assets in accordance with the general allocation rules set forth inandSection; 1.1060-1T(d), subject to the limitation rules contained in andSection;1.1060-1T(e). Thus, in general, the aggregate amount of consideration allocatedto an asset may not exceed the asset's fair market value on the purchasedate, except for assets in the nature of goodwill and going concern value.The rule for decreases in consideration is similar to the one for increases,except that decreases are allocated to assets in the reverse of the orderin which consideration is allocated under andSection; 1.1060-1T(d). Thus,as a general rule, decreases are allocated first among assets in the natureof goodwill and going concern value to the extent of the considerationpreviously allocated to them, and then as a decrease in the considerationpreviously allocated to other acquired assets.The regulations provide that, if an asset has been disposed of, depreciated,amortized, or depleted by the purchaser before an increase (or decrease)in consideration is taken into account, the increase (or decrease) in considerationotherwise allocable to such asset by the purchaser is properly taken intoaccount under principles of tax law applicable when part of the cost ofan asset (not previously reflected in its basis) is paid (or reduced) afterthe asset has been disposed of, depreciated, amortized, or depleted. Forpurposes of this rule, an asset is considered to have been disposed ofto the extent that its allocable portion of a decrease in considerationwould reduce the purchaser's basis in that asset below zero.The regulations provide a special rule analogous to andSection; 1.338(b)-3T(g)for allocating an increase (or decrease) in consideration that directlyrelates to the income produced by a particular intangible asset, such asa patent, copyright, or secret process (``contingent income assets''),as long as the increase (or decrease) in consideration is related to suchcontingent income asset and does not relate to other assets. Subject tothe fair market value and other limitations in andSection; 1.1060-1T(e),the increase (or decrease) in consideration is first allocated to the contingentincome asset and then to other assets. Solely for purposes of applyingthe fair market value and other limitations to a contingent income asset,its fair market value shall be redetermined when the increase (or decrease)is taken into account. (For purposes of this redetermination, only thosecircumstances that resulted in the increase (or decrease) in considerationare taken into account.) In appropriate cases, the Internal Revenue Servicemay apply the principles of this provision to reallocate an increase (ordecrease) in consideration among some of the assets to the extent suchallocation is necessary to reflect properly the consideration that relatesto each of those assets.Reporting RequirementsSection 1.1060-1T(h) of the temporary regulations implements section 1060(b)by requiring that the seller and the purchaser in an applicable asset acquisitioneach report on Form 8594 specific information about the allocation of considerationamong the assets transferred. Each must file Form 8594 with its incometax return or return of income for the taxable year that includes the purchasedate. This reporting requirement applies to asset acquisitions occurringin a taxable year for which the due date (including extensions of time)of the income tax return or return of income is on or after September 13,1988.Information that must be reported on Form 8594 includes:a. The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the purchaserand the seller;b. The purchase date;c. The total consideration of the assets;d. The amount of consideration allocated to each class of assets and theaggregate fair market value of assets of each class;e. A statement as to whether the purchaser and seller agreed upon the fairmarket value of the assets in a sales contract;f. The useful life of each Class III intangible, amortizable asset; andg. A statement as to whether, in connection with the acquisition of thegroup of assets, the purchaser also obtained a license or covenant notto compete or entered into a lease agreement, an employment contract, amanagement contract, or similar arrangement with the seller (or managers,directors, owners, or employees of the seller).The purchaser or seller is required to make a supplemental statement onForm 8594 concerning increases (or decreases) in the amount of considerationallocated to an asset if such increases (or decreases) in considerationoccur after the end of its taxable year that includes the purchase date.Form 8594, reporting the increase (or decrease) in consideration, mustbe filed with the return for the taxable year in which the increase (ordecrease) is taken into account if the due date of that return (includingextensions of time) is on or after September 13, 1988.Interim procedures provide that, if Form 8594 is not available to the generalpublic, the purchaser and the seller must furnish the information requiredunder andSection; 1.1060-1T(h) by filing with their income tax returns acquisitionstatements (as the case may be) which include the information requiredunder andSection; 1.1060-1T(h)(3).Coordination of Sections 1060 and 167This document adds a new temporary regulation under section 167 to providerules for computing the depreciable basis of any property which is includedin an applicable asset acquisition under section 1060. The basis for depreciationof such a depreciable asset cannot exceed the amount of consideration allocatedto that asset under section 1060 and andSection; 1.1060-1T. When the finalregulations are promulgated, this new paragraph will become part of andSection;1.167(a)-5.Amendments to andSection; 1.338(b)-3TIn response to public comment, this document amends andSection; 1.338(b)-3T(g)(1)(ii),the special rule for allocating an increase (or decrease) in adjusted grossed-upbasis that directly relates to the income produced by a ``contingent incomeasset,'' such as a patent, and does not relate to other assets. For purposesof applying the various limitation rules to the contingent income asset,its fair market value is redetermined when the increase (or decrease) inadjusted grossed-up basis is taken into account. The rule has been amendedto clarify that this redetermination is of the asset's fair market valueon the purchase date and that, for purposes of this redetermination, onlythose circumstances that resulted in the increase (or decrease) in considerationare taken into account.Coordination of Sections 1060 and 755The principles of section 1060 apply to any transfer of an interest ina partnership to which section 743(b) or section 732(d) applies, but onlyfor the purpose of determining the amount of the transferee partner's basisadjustment that must be allocated to goodwill and going concern value (hereinafterreferred to as ``goodwill'') under section 755. Temporary regulation andSection;1.755-2T provides rules for determining the fair market value of partnershipproperty and provides that these values must be used for purposes of allocatingbasis under andSection; 1.755-1. Under andSection; 1.755-2T(b)(1), the fairmarket value of partnership property other than goodwill is determinedon the basis of all the facts and circumstances.Section 1.755-2T(b)(2) provides that the fair market value of a partnership'sgoodwill is deemed to equal the amount (not below zero) which if assignedto partnership goodwill would result in a liquidating distribution to thetransferee partner equal to such partner's basis for the transferred partnershipinterest if all partnership property were sold for its fair market valueand the proceeds of that sale were distributed to the partners. The Serviceis currently studying whether to provide additional regulations to addressany situations in which a different method of valuing goodwill would bemore accurate, and invites comment on such situations and alternative rulesfor valuing goodwill.Consistent with the purpose of section 1060, the temporary regulation isintended to overrule the decision in <T3>United States v. Cornish</T3>, 348 F.2d 175 (9th Cir. 1965). Althoughthe regulation provides a new procedure for determining the value of goodwill,andSection; 1.755-2T(d) provides that the requirements of the temporary regulationwill be deemed to be satisfied with respect to any transfer made beforeJuly 15, 1988 if the amount of any basis adjustment under section 743(b)or section 732(d) made as a result of such transfer that is allocated toeach item of partnership property other than goodwill does not exceed theamount equal to the difference between the transferee partner's share ofthe partnership basis of such property and the partner's share of the fairmarket value of such property.Except as provided in andSection; 1.755-2T, section 1060 does not affectthe determination of a transferee partner's share of the basis of partnershipproperty or the determination of the basis of property distributed by thepartnership.<ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses</ITAG>A general notice of proposed rulemaking is not required by 5 U.S.C. 553for temporary regulations. Accordingly, these temporary regulations donot constitute regulations subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5U.S.C. chapter 6). The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has determinedthat this temporary rule is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order12291 and that a regulatory impact analysis therefore is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal author of the temporary regulations under sections 167, 338,1031, and 1060 is Judith C. Winkler of the Legislation and RegulationsDivision of the Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service. Theprincipal author of the temporary regulations under section 755 is RobertE. Shaw of the Legislation and Regulations Division, Office of Chief Counsel,Internal Revenue Service. However, other personnel from the Internal RevenueService and Treasury Department participated in developing the regulations,both on matters of substance and style.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>26 CFR 1.61-1_1.281-4 Income taxes, Taxable income, Deductions, Exemptions. 26 CFR 1.301-1_1.383-3 Income taxes, Corporations, Corporate distributions, Corporate adjustments,Reorganizations. 26 CFR 1.701-1_1.771-1 Income taxes, Partnerships. 26 CFR 1.1001-1_1.1102-3 Income taxes, Gain and loss, Basis, Nontaxable exchanges. 26 CFR PART 602 Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations </ITAG>Accordingly, Parts 1 and 602 of Title 26 of the Code of Federal Regulationsare amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 1_INCOME TAX: TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 1986</ITAG><T4>Paragraph 1.</T4> The authority citation for Part 1 is amended by addingthe following citation:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 26 U.S.C. 7805; * * * andSection; 1.338(b)-3T is alsoissued under 26 U.S.C. 338; * * * andSection; 1.755-2T is also issued under26 U.S.C. 755; * * * andSection; 1.1060-1T is also issued under 26 U.S.C.1060.</ITAG><T4>Par. 2.</T4> There is added in the appropriate place a new andSection;1.1060-1T.

An ``applicable asset acquisition'' is any transfer,whether direct or indirect, of a group of assets if (i) the assets transferredconstitute a trade or business in the hands of either the seller or thepurchaser and (ii) except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section,the purchaser's basis in the transferred assets is determined wholly byreference to the purchaser's consideration. (2)<T3> Assets constituting a trade or business.</T3> For purposes of thissection, a group of assets constitutes a trade or business if the use ofsuch assets would constitute an active trade or business for purposes ofsection 355. Even though a group of assets may not qualify as an activetrade or business for purposes of section 355, it will constitute a tradeor business for purposes of this section if its character is such thatgoodwill or going concern value could under any circumstances attach tosuch group. In making this determination, all the facts and circumstancessurrounding the transaction shall be taken into account. Factors to beconsidered include: (i) The existence of an excess of the total consideration over the aggregatebook value of the tangible and intangible assets purchased (other thangoodwill and going concern value) as shown in the financial accountingbooks and records of the purchaser; and (ii) Related transactions, including lease agreements, licenses, convenantsnot to compete, employment contracts, management contracts, or other similaragreements between the purchaser and seller (or managers, directors, owners,or employees of the seller) in connection with the transfer. (3)<T3> Examples</T3>. Paragraph (b) (1) and (2) of this section may be illustratedby the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1)</T3>. S is a high grade machine shop that manufacturesmicrowave connectors in limited quantities. It is a successful companywith a reputation within the industry and among its customers for manufacturingunique, high quality products. Its tangible assets consist primarily ofordinary machinery for working metal and plating. It has not secret formulasor patented drawings of value. P is a company that designs, manufactures,and markets electronic components. It wants to establish an immediate presencein the microwave industry, an area in which it previously has not beenengaged. P is acquiring assets of a number of smaller companies and hopesthat these assets will collectively allow it to offer a broad product mix.P acquires the assets of S in order to augment its product mix and to promoteits presence in the microwave industry. P will not use the assets acquiredfrom S to manufacture microwave connectors. The assets transferred areassets which constitute a trade or business in the hands of the seller.Thus, P's purchase of S's assets is an applicable asset acquisition. Thefact that P will not use the assets acquired from S to continue the businessof S does not affect this conclusion. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2)</T3>. S, a sole proprietor who operates a restaurant, leasesthe building housing the restaurant and sells all its restaurant equipmentto P. S's use of the building and the restaurant equipment constitute atrade or business. P begins operating a restaurant in the building it leasesfrom S. Because the assets transferred together with the asset leased areassets which constitute a trade or business, P's purchase of S's assetsis an applicable asset acquisition. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3)</T3>. The S corporation conducts various business enterprisesincluding a retail store in State X that conducts activities that meetthe active trade or business requirements for purposes of section 355.P is a minority shareholder of S. In complete redemption of P's stock inS held by P within the meaning of section 302(b)(3), S distributes to Pall the assets of S used in S's retail business in State X. The distributionof S's assets in redemption of P's stock is treated as a sale or exchange,and P's basis in the assets transferred is determined wholly by referenceto the consideration paid, the S stock. Thus, S's distribution of assetsconstituting a trade or business to P is an applicable asset acquisition.</ITAG>(4)<T3> Like-kind exchange</T3>. Notwithstanding the fact that a portion ofa group of assets which constitute a trade or business is exchanged forlike-kind property, the transaction nevertheless may constitute an applicableasset acquisition. For purposes of this subparagraph (4), like-kind propertymeans any property permitted by section 1031, 1035, or 1036 to be receivedwithout the recognition of gain or loss. For purposes of determining whetherthe transaction constitutes an applicable asset acquisition, (i) the factthat, by reason of section 1031(d), the purchaser's basis in the groupof assets is not determined wholly by reference to the consideration paidis disregarded, and (ii) whether the assets transferred constitute a tradeor business is determined by taking into account all the assets transferred(including the like-kind property). If an applicable asset acquisitionincludes like-kind property, then for purposes of allocating considerationamong the assets under paragraph (d) of this section, the like-kind propertyexchanged and any other property or money which is treated as transferredin exchange for the like-kind property are excluded. The basis in and thegain or loss recognized from the like-kind property exchanged and the otherproperty (if any) which is treated as transferred in exchange for the like-kindproperty is determined under section 1031. For purposes of this section,the amount of money and other property that is treated as transferred inexchange for the like-kind property is equal to so much of the amount ofmoney and the fair market value of other property as does not exceed thedifference between the fair market values of the like-kind properties exchanged.The money and other property that are treated as transferred in exchangefor the like-kind property (and which are excluded from the assets to whichsection 1060 applies) are considered to come from the following assetsin the following order: first from Class I assets, then from Class II assets,then from Class III assets, and then from Class IV assets. For this purpose,liabilities assumed (or to which the like-kind property or other propertythat is part of the like-kind exchange is subject) are treated as ClassI assets. See<T3> Example (3)</T3> in paragraph (g) of this section for an example ofthe application of section 1060 to a single transaction which is, in part,a like-kind exchange.(c) <T3>Definitions_</T3>(1) <T3>Consideration. </T3>The purchaser's consideration is the cost of theassets acquired in the applicable asset acquisition. The seller's considerationis the amount realized from the applicable asset acquisition under section1001(b). (2) <T3>Fair market value. </T3>Generally, the fair market value of an assetis its gross fair market value (<T3>i.e., </T3>fair market value determined without regard to mortgages,liens, pledges, or other liabilities). However, for purposes of determiningthe amount of the seller's gain or loss, the fair market value of any propertysubject to a nonrecourse indebtedness shall be treated as being not lessthan the amount of such indebtedness. (For purposes of the preceding sentence,a liability that was incurred by reason of the acquisition of the propertyis disregarded to the extent that such liability was not taken into accountin determining the seller's basis in such property.) (3) <T3>Purchase date. </T3>The purchase date is the date on which the applicableasset acquisition occurs. (d) <T3>Allocation of consideration among assets under the residual method_</T3>(1)<T3>Reduction in the amount of consideration for cash and other items designatedby the Internal Revenue Service. </T3>Consideration is first reduced bythe amount of Class I assets (if any) transferred by the seller. ClassI assets are cash, demand deposits and like accounts in banks, savingsand loan associations (and other depository institutions), and other similaritems designated in the Internal Revenue Bulletin by the Internal RevenueService. The amount of the consideration remaining after the reductionis to be allocated to the other assets transferred. (2) <T3>Assets other than Class I assets. </T3>Subject to the limitations andother special rules of paragraph (e) of this section, consideration (asreduced by the amount of Class I assets) is allocated among Class II assetstransferred by the seller in proportion to the fair market values of suchClass II assets on the purchase date, then among Class III assets transferredby the seller in proportion to the fair market values of such Class IIIassets on that date, and finally to Class IV assets. (i) <T3>Class II assets. </T3>Class II assets are certificates of deposit,U.S. government securities, readily marketable stock or securities (withinthe meaning of andSection;1.351-1(c)(3)), foreign currency, and other itemsdesignated in the Internal Revenue Bulletin by the Internal Revenue Service.(ii) <T3>Class III assets. </T3>Class III assets are all assets (other thanClass I, II, and IV assets), both tangible and intangible (whether or notdepreciable, depletable, or amortizable), including furniture and fixtures,land, buildings, equipment, accounts receivable, and covenants not to compete.(iii) <T3>Class IV assets. </T3>Class IV assets are intangible assets in thenature of goodwill and going concern value. (e) <T3>Certain limitations and special rules for consideration allocable toan asset</T3>_(1) <T3>Allocation not to exceed fair market value. </T3>The amount of considerationallocated to an asset (other than Class IV assets) shall not exceed thefair market value of that asset on the purchase date.(2) <T3>Other limitations.</T3> The amount of consideration allocated to anasset is subject to any applicable limitations under the Code or generalprinciples of tax law. For example, if the applicable asset acquisitionis a transaction described in section 1056(a) (relating to basis limitationfor player contracts transferred in connection with the sale of a franchise),the amount of consideration the purchaser may allocate to a contract forthe services of an athlete shall not exceed the limitation imposed by thatsection.(3) <T3>Liabilities taken into account in determining amount realized on subsequentdisposition. </T3>In determining the amount realized on a subsequent saleor other disposition of property acquired by the purchaser, the entireamount of any liability included in determining the purchaser's considerationis considered to be an amount taken into account in determining the purchaser'sbasis in property which secures such liability for purposes of applyingandSection; 1.1001-2(a). Thus, if a liability is included in the purchaser'sconsideration, andSection; 1.1001-2(a)(3) shall not prevent the amount ofsuch liability from being treated as discharged within the meaning of andSection;1.1001-2(a)(4) as a result of the purchaser's sale or disposition of theproperty which secures such liability.(4) <T3>Internal Revenue Service authority. </T3>In connection with the examinationof a return, the Internal Revenue Service may challenge the taxpayer'sdetermination of the fair market value of any asset by any appropriatemethod and take into account all factors, including any lack of adversetax interests between the parties. For example, in certain cases the InternalRevenue Service may make an independent showing of the value of goodwilland going concern value as a means of calling into question the validityof the taxpayer's valuation of other assets.(f) <T3>Subsequent adjustments to consideration</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>If there is an increase or a decrease in considerationof either the seller or the purchaser after the purchase date that mustbe taken into account in order to adjust or redetermine, under applicableprinciples of tax law, the seller's amount realized with respect to, orthe purchaser's cost of, the assets transferred, then such increase ordecrease is allocated by the seller or the purchaser among the assets pursuantto this paragraph (f).(2) <T3>Allocation of increases in consideration</T3>_(i) <T3>In general. </T3>An increase in consideration is allocated under paragraph(d) of this section among the assets transferred. Amounts allocable toan asset (or with respect to an asset disposed of by the purchaser) aresubject to the fair market value limitation and other limitations in paragraph(e) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of thissection, for the purpose of applying paragraph (e) of this section, thefair market value is the fair market value on the purchase date.(ii) <T3>Effect of disposition or depreciation of assets by purchaser. </T3>Ifan asset has been disposed of, depreciated, amortized, or depleted by thepurchaser before an increase in consideration is taken into account, theincrease in consideration otherwise allocable to such asset by the purchasershall be taken into account under principles of tax law applicable whenpart of the cost of an asset (not previously reflected in its basis) ispaid after the asset has been disposed of, depreciated, amortized, or depleted.(3) <T3>Allocation of decreases in consideration</T3>_(i) <T3>In general. </T3>A decrease in consideration is allocated in the followingorder: (A) first, as a reduction in the amount previously allocated toClass IV assets, (B) second, as a reduction in the amount previously allocatedto Class III assets in proportion to their fair market values, and (C)finally, as a reduction in the amount previously allocated to Class IIassets in proportion to their fair market values. Decreases in considerationallocated to an asset shall not exceed the amount of consideration previouslyallocated to that asset. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) ofthis section (relating to patents and similar property), the fair marketvalue is the fair market value on the purchase date.(ii) <T3>Effect of disposition of assets or reduction of basis below zero. </T3>Ifan asset has been disposed of, depreciated, amortized, or depleted by thepurchaser before a decrease in consideration is taken into account, thedecrease in the purchaser's consideration otherwise allocable to such assetshall be taken into account under principles of tax law applicable whenthe cost of an asset (previously reflected in basis) is reduced after theasset has been disposed of or depreciated, amortized, or depleted. Forpurposes of this subdivision (ii), an asset is considered to have beendisposed of to the extent that its allocable portion of the decrease inconsideration would reduce its basis below zero.(4) <T3>Specific allocation of increases (or decreases) in consideration tocertain contingent income assets</T3>_(i) <T3>Patents and similar property. </T3>The specific allocation under paragraph(f)(4)(ii) of this section of an increase (or decrease) in considerationapplies if (A) the increase (or decrease) is the result of a contingencythat directly relates to income produced by a particular intangible asset(``contingent income asset''), such as a patent, a secret process, or acopyright, and (B) the increase (or decrease) is related to such contingentincome asset and not to other assets. Consideration as initially determined,and any increase (or decrease) in consideration to which this specificallocation rule does not apply, are allocated among the assets (includingcontingent income assets) in accordance with the provisions of paragraph(f) (2) and (3) of this section.(ii) <T3>Specific allocation. </T3>Subject to the fair market value and otherlimitations in paragraph (e) of this section, any increase (or decrease)in consideration to which this subdivision (ii) applies is allocated first,specifically to the contingent income asset to which the increase (or decrease)relates and, then, under paragraph (f) (2) (or 3)) of this section. Solelyfor purposes of applying the fair market value and other limitations toa contingent income asset, the fair market value of such asset on the purchasedate shall be redetermined when the increase (or decrease) is taken intoaccount. (For purposes of this redetermination, only those circumstancesthat resulted in the increase (or decrease) in consideration are takeninto account.) This redetermination does not affect the fair market valuelimitations or other limitations as they apply to other transferred assets.(5) <T3>Internal Revenue Service authority. </T3>In connection with the examinationof a return, the Internal Revenue Service, in appropriate cases, may applythe principles of paragraph (f)(4) of this section to allocate an increase(or decrease) in consideration among particular assets to the extent suchallocation is necessary to reflect properly the consideration that relatesto each of those assets.(g) <T3>Examples. </T3>The provisions of paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (f)of this section may be illustrated by the following examples: <ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>(i) On January 1, 1987, S, a sole proprietor, sellsto P, a corporation, a group of assets which constitute a trade or businessunder paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

Since P acquiredno Class I assets, the total consideration of $3,000 is next allocatedfirst to Class II and then to Class III assets. Since the fair market valueof the Class II asset is $400, $400 of consideration is allocated to theClass II asset. Since the remaining amount of consideration is $2,600 (<T3>i.e., </T3>$3,000-$400), an amount which exceeds the sum of the fairmarket values of the Class III assets ($2,400), the amount allocated toeach Class III asset is its fair market value.

The seller and the purchaser each must file assetacquisition statements on Form 8594 with their income tax returns or returnsof income for the taxable year that includes the purchase date. This reportingrequirement applies to asset acquisitions that occur in a taxable yearfor which the due date (including extensions of time) of the income taxreturn or return of income is on or after September 13, 1988.(ii) <T3>Additional reporting requirement. </T3>If the amount of considerationallocated to any asset by the seller or the purchaser is increased (ordecreased) after the taxable year that includes the purchase date, theseller or purchaser making the increase (or decrease) shall file a supplementalasset acquisition statement on Form 8594 with the income tax return orreturn of income for the taxable year in which the increase (or decrease)is properly taken into account.

ABC has three assets:a building with a fair market value of $2,000,000, equipment with a fairmarket value of $800,000 and goodwill. ABC has no liabilities. A has aone-third interest in partnership capital and profits. A sells his partnershipinterest to D for $1,000,000. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, thefair market value of goodwill is deemed to equal the value that must beassigned to goodwill in order for the partnership to distribute $1,000,000to D if it were to sell all of its property at fair market value (in thecase of goodwill, its assigned value) and completely liquidate after D'spurchase of A's partnership interest. In order for D, a one-third partner,to receive a liquidation distribution of $1,000,000, the partnership wouldhave to sell all partnership property for a total of $3,000,000. The fairmarket value of partnership property other than goodwill is $2,800,000.Therefore, goodwill must be assigned a value of $200,000 ($3,000,000 ^$2,800,000) in order for D to receive a liquidating distribution of $1,000,000.Accordingly, D's section 743(b) basis adjustment must be allocated underandSection; 1.755-1 using a fair market value of $200,000 for goodwill.</ITAG><T4>Par. 6. </T4>Immediately after andSection; 1.1031(d)-1, there is addeda new andSection; 1.103(d)-1T to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.1031(d)-1T</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Coordination of section 1060 with section 1031 (temporary).</ITAG>If the properties exchanged under section 1031 are part of a group of assetswhich constitute a trade or business under section 1060, the like-kindproperty and other property or money which are treated as transferred inexchange for the like-kind property shall be excluded from the allocationrules of section 1060.
