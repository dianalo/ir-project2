But at the same time, the court here rejected the Securities and Exchange Commission's argument that newsletter readers should be told when favorable articles are ghost-written by the companies themselves or their publicists. In so ruling, the three-judge panel said it wants to keep the SEC from venturing &quot;very close to content regulation of speech.&quot;    The decision stems from a suit the SEC filed in 1982 against Wall Street Publishing Institute Inc., the Yonkers, N.Y., publisher of Stock Market Magazine. In the suit, the SEC alleged that the publisher had violated the anti-fraud and anti-touting provisions of the securities laws by failing to disclose, among other things, that advertising space and article reprints were bought in return for favorable publicity in the newsletter.    A federal district court in Washington had ruled that the SEC didn't have the authority to require such a disclosure. Yesterday, the appellate panel reversed that decision and remanded the case for further hearing.    The panel, in effect, awarded half a loaf to both sides. The ruling &quot;allows us to regulate a lot of abusive practices -- cash payments, the quid pro quos,&quot; said SEC attorney Richard Kirby. But he added that it also emphasizes that &quot;the First Amendment restricts the government's ability to regulate speech in connection with securities transactions.&quot;    The SEC contends that the magazine, owned by former Yonkers Mayor Angelo Martinelli, published the ghost-written articles &quot;substantially&quot; as written. But the panel wouldn't buy the agency's argument that &quot;substantial use&quot; of such &quot;free text&quot; should be disclosed.    Conditioning regulation on the extent to which a text is used &quot;would result in both SEC and court interference with the 'crucial process' of editorial control,&quot; the panel said. The Supreme Court has called such interference &quot;repugnant to core First Amendment concerns,&quot; the panel added.    Mr. Martinelli's lawyer, Joseph Sharlitt, said he sees &quot;dangerous&quot; implications in requiring publishers to disclose quid-pro-quo arrangements: &quot;It means all business practices of the press can be examined for any tie-in for ads and reprints about companies.&quot;    Neither side has decided whether to appeal. </TEXT></DOC>
