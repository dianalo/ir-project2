The comment period on the NPRM closed on December 13, 1982.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>Comments on the proposed rulemaking were received from TransaandCx.174;1mericaAirlines, Inc. (Transamerica). Transamerica stated that it had no objectionto the adoption of the rulemaking, provided that the removal of the regulationswould not present a barrier to their reintroduction if the Board requiredcharter tariffs to be filed in the future.<ITAG tagnum="84">Disposition of Rulemaking</ITAG>In view of the elapsed time since the rulemaking, we are requesting whetherthere is any additional information that we should consider before finalizingthis rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="85">Executive Order 12291, Regulatory Flexibility Act, Paperwork ReductionAct, and Federalism Assessment</ITAG>The Department certifies that this rule is not a major rule as definedby Executive Order 12291. It would not result in an annual effect on theeconomy of $100 million or more. There would be no increase in productioncosts or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, orlocal governments, agencies, or geographical regions. Furthermore, it wouldnot adversely affect competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. Similarly,the Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is not significant underthe Department's regulatory policies and procedures. Furthermore, no regulatoryevaluation is necessary because the economic impact of the proposal wouldbe minimal.This rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that theconcepts discussed therein do not have sufficient federalism implicationsto warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment.With respect to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Public Law 96-511,this rule contains no new information collection requirements that requirethe approval of the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Act.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC on October 5, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jeffrey N.
