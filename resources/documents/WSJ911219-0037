These are among the most importantfactors in choosing a personal computer, yet the computerindustry, as usual, seems determined to make them as opaqueas possible.   Even distinguishing between memory and disk storage isn'teasy for novices. The two are quite different, but memorychips and hard disks hold the same kinds of information, andtheir capacities are measured in the same unfamiliar units,such as kilobytes and megabytes.   Then there are different types of disks. Some kinds of&quot;floppy&quot; disks are flexible, but others are rigid -- yet theyaren't &quot;hard&quot; disks, which are something else entirely.What's more, little floppy disks hold much more informationthan big ones.   It's no wonder that regular people get confused by allthis, while computer junkies like to act superior becausethey understand it.   So, here's a brief primer on memory and disk storage. Thisweek, I'll outline the basic concepts. Next week, I'll try toshow how they apply to choosing a computer.   Computers must have a way to store the information thatpeople enter into them. The first repository is a set ofspecial chips called memory chips, or, in jargon, RAM, forrandom access memory. As you type words that appear on yourscreen, your words are being stored only in the computer'smemory chips.   RAM works well, but it has two huge limitations. First,its capacity is limited to the number of chips that can bestuffed into the computer. Second, and more important, it isstrictly temporary. Memory chips can remember what's in themonly while the computer is on. Once the power is cut off,everything stored in memory is wiped out.   So computers also feature a second way to store data thatoffers both higher capacity and permanence: disks. Thesecontain spinning platters coated with materials similar towhat's used on audio or video tapes. They record the samekind of information held in memory chips, but they can holdmuch more of it and they retain it when the power goes off.   Personal computers move data often between these two kindsof storage. When you load a software program from a disk, youare moving the program's content into the computer's memorychips. When you enter information, you should transfer thatmaterial periodically from temporary memory to permanent diskstorage by saving your file onto the disk.   Think of memory as being roughly analogous to thetemporary assembly of documents on your desk for completingsome project: They are usually cleaned off the desk whenyou're finished. Disk storage, in contrast, is more like afile cabinet in which you permanently store those documents.   The capacity of both memory chips and disks is measured inthings called bytes. A byte is roughly equal to a singletyped character. A kilobyte, or &quot;K,&quot; is roughly a thousandbytes, or about 150 to 200 words. A megabyte, or &quot;MB,&quot; is amillion bytes -- enough to store a hefty book.   Whenever you see references to a computer's &quot;memory&quot; or&quot;RAM,&quot; they are describing the temporary memory in the chips.References to &quot;storage&quot; or &quot;HD&quot; (for hard disk) involvepermanent disk storage capacity. Disk storage isn't usuallycalled &quot;memory.&quot;   So much for the difference between memory and diskstorage. Now, how about the differences among the varioustypes and sizes of disks you can use for storage? Again, thecomputer industry seems to have gone out of its way to makethings confusing.   There are two basic kinds of disks. Floppy disks aresmall, flexible round platters inside square outer shells.You store data on them and retrieve data from them byinserting them into disk drives, which are analagous to taperecorders.   The second type, hard disks, are rigid metal platters insealed devices. The tape-recorder mechanism is built in, andthe disk can't be removed from its drive. Hard disk drivesare usually hidden inside the computer and hold much moredata than floppies.   But wait: There are two standard sizes of floppy disks.The larger, 5.25-inch size that older IBM-compatiblecomputers use have flexible shells and usually hold only 360kilobytes of data. The smaller, 3.5-inch size used by Apple'sMacintosh computers and newer IBM-compatibles sport rigidplastic shells. Though physically smaller, they areengineered to pack at least twice as much data onto theirrecording surface.   To cause more bewilderment, the industry sells floppydisks in two capacities known by unhelpful names. Thelow-capacity types are labeled &quot;double sided/double density.&quot;The high-capacity type is called &quot;high density,&quot; and requiresa higher-performing floppy disk drive. In the case of5.25-inch disks, the high-density version holds 1.2 megabytesinstead of the usual 360K. In the case of 3.5-inch disks, thelowest-capacity version holds 720K (for IBM-compatiblemachines) or 800K (for Macs), and high-density disks hold 1.4megabytes. The latter type of 3.5-inch disk usually has theletters &quot;HD&quot; stamped on its rigid plastic shell. Though theselittle disks are hard to the touch and say &quot;HD,&quot; they aren't&quot;hard disks.&quot;   No, sir. Hard disks, remember, are those sealed-up,unremovable kind of disks, distinguished chiefly by theirmuch greater capacity. Today's popular computerconfigurations include hard disks that almost always havemore than 40 megabytes of capacity, and often have 100megabytes or more. Got it?</TEXT></DOC>
