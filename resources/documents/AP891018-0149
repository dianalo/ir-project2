(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Space shuttle Atlantis dartedbetween two storm systems and thundered flawlessly into orbittoday, starting the plutonium-powered Galileo probe on atwice-delayed, roundabout journey to Jupiter.   The 132-ton winged Atlantis with a crew of five lifted off at12:53 p.m., riding a 700-foot column of flame out over the Atlanticon a five-day mission that anti-nuclear activists fearful of aChallenger-like accident were unable to stop.   Two minutes after liftoff, the two solid fuel booster rocketsburned out and fell away as planned. Mission Control reported 8{minutes after blastoff that the shuttle had reached orbit more than100 miles above the Earth.   ``You looked marvelous going up,'' Mission Control said.   ``I feel a lot better,'' replied Atlantis commander Don Williams.   Also feeling better were scientists who have worked since 1978on the Galileo project, surviving money problems that delayed theoriginal 1982 launch date and the 1986 Challenger explosion thatpushed the launch off three more years.   ``It feels great. It's been a long time,'' said Lennard Fisk,NASA's chief scientist. ``Each of these missions opens up a newscience door.''   During the first hour of flight, the astronauts encounteredminor problems with a cooling system and with an electronic part onone of the ship's maneuvering engines. Both were corrected quickly.   Atlantis was grounded Tuesday by rain and last week by a faultyengine computer. Its launch was in doubt up to a few minutes beforeliftoff today because of a cold front to one side and offshore rainclouds to the other.   Thousands were at the Kennedy Space Center and nearby vantagepoints to watch the start of the 31st space shuttle mission, duringwhich the astronauts will deploy Galileo and also conduct medicaland other scientific experiments.   About 200 armed security guards _ on land, in boats and in theair _ were alert for anti-nuclear trespassers who had threatened tosit on the pad if necessary to halt the launch, but liftoff tookplace without incident.   The astronauts were to release the 6,700-pound Galileo fromAtlantis' cargo bay about 6{ hours after liftoff for a looping,six-year, 2.4-billion-mile journey to Jupiter, the colossus of thesolar system with a radius 11 times that of Earth.   The $1.5 billion Galileo, the most expensive unmanned spacevehicle ever built, is expected to give the best look yet at themysteries of another planet. ``It is the Rolls-Royce ofspacecraft,'' said Clayne Yeates, a mission manager.   The mission ends Monday in the Mojave Desert at Edwards AirForce Base, Calif. Besides Williams, the crew members are pilotMike McCulley and mission specialists Ellen Baker, FranklinChang-Diaz and Shannon Lucid.   Anti-nuclear activists last week lost a lawsuit to block thelaunch. They charged that the 50 pounds of plutonium that supplyelectricity to Galileo could scatter radiation over Florida in theevent of an accident.   NASA says the chances of a plutonium release are 1-in-25,000,and even if there were a release there would be no appreciable harmto the public.   Demonstrators had said they might try to halt liftoff byinfiltrating the launch area. But Bruce Gagnon, a protest leader,said his group had made its point Monday when eight members gotarrested for trespassing at the space center.   Two more people were arrested Tuesday _ one for crossing a spacecenter boundary and another for releasing a helium balloon shapedlike a person less than an hour before launch time.   Once it reaches Jupiter, Galileo will fire a probe into itsatmosphere and orbit the planet for 22 months for clues to theformation of the universe.   Scientists believe the planet still holds much of the material,in its original state, from which the universe formed more than 15billion years ago.   NASA had been concerned whether an Air Force control center inSunnyvale, Calif., inside Tuesday's earthquake zone, would beoperating to command the rocket that sends Galileo into deep spaceonce it leaves the shuttle.   But the space agency received assurances at an early morningmeeting that the Consolidated Space Test Center at Onizuka AirForce Base would be ready.   Under launch-team rules, a second straight postponement todaywould have triggered an automatic 48-hour delay, meaning Atlantiswould be grounded until at least Friday. The rule is designed toprevent launch team fatigue.   NASA had to launch the Galileo by Nov. 21 or else wait untilJuly 1991 for the Earth and Jupiter to come back into properalignment.   The delays worried NASA because of the cost of keeping thespacecraft on standby and because Galileo's nuclear power pack wasrunning down.</TEXT></DOC>
