The unrest that left hundreds and perhaps thousands of peopledead has seriously damaged the goodwill and trust once extended theCommunist nation.   France, Holland and Sweden have barred diplomatic contacts withofficials in China, while the United States, Britain and Switzerlandbanned military sales to Beijing.   China's Foreign Ministry today rebuked the United States fortrying to exert pressure on China over what it said was a ``purelyinternal affair.''   Washington sells China more than $600 million of militaryequipment a year, and private U.S. dealers sell another $85 million.Officials would not provide Britain's military sales to China butIndependent Television set the amount at $4.7 million a year.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher expressed ``utter revulsion'' atthe Chinese crackdown and said, ``We will be thinking how best todemonstrate that in practical ways.''   The Dutch government summoned Chinese Charge d'Affaires Li QinPing and told him the Netherlands ``is exceptionally shocked by theviolent and brutal actions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.''   The 12-nation European Economic Community strongly condemned theChinese action and appealed to authorities to stop using force.   In Moscow, members of the Congress of People's Deputies called onChina's leaders to use ``wisdom, reason and a weighted approach''but did not denounce the violence. The Soviet Foreign Ministry madeno comment. The two communist giants are trying to mend fences afterdecades of estrangement.   Achille Occhetto, head of Italy's Communist Party, urged theKremlin to take a strong stance against the massacre and distancedhis party from the leaders responsible for the crackdown. Italy hasthe largest communist party in the West.   Meanwhile, Chinese students and others staged protests outsideChinese embassies in Seoul, Stockholm, Madrid, Abu Dhabi, Belgrade,the Hague, Athens and other cities.   In Hong Kong, authorities used tear gas to disperse 4,000 peoplein the twin city of Kowloon who tried to break into Chinese banks inthe area and hurled stones and bottles at police this morning.   Singaporeans joined a movement started earlier in the week inHong Kong to withdraw $32 million in deposits from Chinese banks outof fear and to protest the bloodshed in Beijing, bank officials said.   Wewe Cho Yao, president of a Singapore Chinese group, the ChineseClan Associations, said the killings in China had shaken theconfidence of foreign investors.   About 76 percent of the 2.6 million people in Singapore areethnic Chinese.   In Hong Kong, wreaths were placed outside China's Xinhua NewsAgency office in memory of those who died in Beijing, and somepeople wore black armbands.   Authorities in Taiwan lifted a ban on telephone links to theChinese mainland to encourage private contacts between people onboth sides of the Taiwan Straits and to help break a news blackoutinside China, Communications Minister Chang Chien-pang said.   The links will be through Hong Kong and will be operable withinthree days, he said.   The Nationalist government, which lost a civil war in China tothe Communists in 1949, has lifted restrictions on visits to themainland the past two years, although it continues to ban officialcontacts.   The Broadcasting Corporation of China, Taiwan's state radiostation, kicked off a 24-hour news broadcast to China on shortwavechannels with a hotline accepting telephone calls from Chineselisteners.   About 20 leaders of the opposition Democratic Progressive Partybegan a 15-day hunger strike to mourn the deaths in China, while inthe central city of Miaoli, about 74 miles southwest of Taipei,10,000 people rallied in protest.   Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, in remarks to Parliament,said ``leveling guns at the people is a grave matter.''   Japanese Vice Minister Ryohei Murata summoned Chinese AmbassadorYang Zhenya, and told him the situation in China was ``veryregrettable,'' but Tokyo continued to view it as an ``internalaffair,'' a ministry official said.   Negotiations on a $120 million loan for an oil project andanother $250 million loan through the Asian Development Bank werecut off, said Teruo Takada, spokesman for the Federation of BankersAssociations of Japan.   Japan is the largest contributor of aid to China and theassistance, most in the form of loans, has totaled more than $6.1billion during the 1980s.   Many governments have advised their citizens in China to leavethe country as reports spread of Chinese soldiers battling eachother in Beijing. Some, including Britain and Australia, haveordered the evacuation of non-essential diplomatic personnel anddependents.   The U.S. State Department urged the 1,440 Americans in Beijing toleave and made arrangements for U.S. airlines to fly them to safety.   Special flights also were arranged for Canadians, Australians,New Zealanders, Swiss and Hong Kong residents, among others.</TEXT></DOC>
