 Adobe will package its font-rendering technology as a module, calledType Manager, that can be used for screen displays, and will sell it in bothend-user and OEM markets.andP;  Adobe will release a Macintosh version sometimethis fall, and says that versions for other platforms will follow later.andM;This is a major change of direction for Adobe.andP;  It is now selling andlicensing its font technology separate from Post-Script.andP;  This is not an&quot;open to all comers&quot; licensing strategy.andP;  Rather, Adobe will negotiatespecific agreements with specific companies that want to put Adobe fontrendering into their displays and printers.andM;Macintosh Type Manager.andP;  Adobe will sell its Macintosh screen-font scalingsoftware directly to end users.andP;  Type Manager will be easily installed in theMac system, we were told.andP;  Thereafter, whenever a font/size combination foran Adobe font is requested and a screen bitmap is not available, Type Managerwill create the font on the fly from the Post-Script printer font outline.andM;Type Manager, as it stands now, will only work with Adobe's encrypted Type 1fonts.andP;  Adobe said that it will work to support user-defined Type 3 fonts,but noted that a font is a Post-Script program and might contain any legalPostScript command.andP;  Type Manager is not a complete implementation of DisplayPostScript, and thus a user-defined font might contain commands the TypeManager could not understand.andM;Even more important, we think, Type 1 fonts contain hints and Type 3 fonts donot.andP;  Hints, which are necessary to improve the appearance of output onlow-resolution devices like 300-dpi laser printers, are absolutely crucialfor readability on screens, whose resolution is typically 70-100 dpi.andM;Type Manager does not provide for rotated type and other special effects.andO;However, if it were installed in a system that can rotate general screen bitmaps, then the system could rotate type that way.andP;  However, the type wouldprobably look awful.andM;Adobe says that Type Manager will run in a 1-MB Macintosh, but performancewill be better with a 2-MB machine.andM;Apple's System 7.andP;  Two weeks ago, Apple held a briefing for softwaredevelopers to disclose the features that will be in the next major upgrade toMacintosh system software.andP;  Apple will be building the basis for amazingtypographic sophistication into every Macintosh.andM;Although System 7.0 will not be a true multitasking operating system, it willoffer many of the features that a modern operating system should have:andM;* 32-bit addressing.andP;  Although the Mac is a 32-bit machine, the currentoperating system only uses 24-bit addressing to span an 8-MB range.andP;  System7.0 will be able to address up to 4 GB of real memory.andM;* Virtual memory.andP;  The system will treat a portion of the hard disk as anextension of RAM.andP;  Programs and data are swapped from memory to disk and backagain as needed, allowing peak-load demands on memory to be handled withoutcrashing the program.andM;* Inter-application communications.andP;  The system will support live links ofdata between programs, or allow one program to control another.andP;  Users willbe able to write scripts (in a Hyper-Talk-like language) to controlapplications.andM;* Color QuickDraw.andP;  This is available now as an add-on function.andP;  It will bebuilt into System 7.andM;* SQL database access.andP;  Support for CL/1 servers will be built in.andM;* Improved Finder file management.andP;  Programs will be able to write &quot;comments&quot;that show up in directory displays.andP;  The functions of the Font/DA Mover andthe Chooser will become an integral part of the Finder.andM;Outline fonts.andP;  Apple looked at the available outline font formats anddecided it didn't like any of them, so it is developing its own.andP;  Macoutlines will be expressed as quadratic curves.andP;  Quadratics were chosen overBeziers, conics, spirals and all the other techniques primarily for fastcomputation times.andP;  Apple will publish the format and will encourage thirdparties to make and market Macintosh outline fonts.andM;The quality of screen display will be enhanced by the most elaborate systemof hints we have yet seen.andP;  Apple has created a hinting language that appearsto include a superset of all the functions other vendors use, plus logiccommands like a programming language.andP;  Fonts that have been given the fullhinting treatment look remarkably good on the screen, even at small sizes.andM;Layout Manager.andP;  Besides hints, the Apple fonts will contain informationabout character shape, kerning values and so on.andP;  This will support accurateplacement of superiors and inferiors and the generation of Rubis (phoneticpronunciation identification for rarely-used Kanji characters).andP;  Another partof the new Apple software, the Layout Manager, will use the font metricinformation to perform on-the-fly kerning on screen.andP;  There is even afunction that will stretch portions of characters to join with othercharacters, as is required for cursive writing or for kashidas in Arabic.andM;Availability.andP;  Apple has not set a specific release date, but hopes to havethe new software out early in 1990.andP;  System 7.0 will require at least 2 MB ofmemory to run.andM;Apple plans to issue a base set of 15-20 fully-hinted fonts.andP;  Beyond that, itwants to encourage third-party font vendors to convert their fonts to theApple format.andP;  (Monotype has already announced that it will issue &quot;asubstantial part&quot; of its library in Apple format.)andP;  However, beyondpublishing the format information, Apple will probably not be able to providefont foundries with much support for automating the conversion process.andM;Auto conversion.andP;  Writing conversion programs will not be very difficult, butthe trouble with automatic conversion is that the output will contain no morehinting information than did the original source data.andP;  Most font librariesthat were created for high-resolution typesetters do not have any hints atall.andP;  Other libraries have hints, but not at the level needed for good screenrendering.andP;  At first, we think, vendors will have to supply hand-tuned bitmaps for small type sizes or go to the trouble of inserting the fullcomplement of Apple hints.andP;  In time, someone may come up with an Appleequivalent of Folio's TypeMaker that can take existing unhinted outlines andgenerate the hints automatically.andM;Apple vs.andP;  Adobe.andP;  Since Apple has invented its own outline font system andhinting scheme--a completely different system from the Type Manager thatAdobe will be offering--Mac users face the prospect of two different fonttechnologies for their displays.andP;  Worse, the Apple fonts will not workdirectly with the Adobe PostScript printers that Apple sells, and will notmatch the Adobe fonts in key details.andP;  We think this would prove intolerablein practice.andP;  So do Apple and Adobe.andM;Adobe has said it will write software to convert Apple outlines into Adobeformat.andP;  We do not know how this will work, but we presume that Adobe willconvert the Apple outlines into Post-Script Type 1 outlines and will use itsown hint-insertion software to generate the necessary hints for properprinting on 300-dpi printers.andP;  Macintosh users would then buy these Adobefonts for their printers, and could also use them directly on their screensvia Type Manager.andM;Implications.andP;  It is eminently rational to use the same imaging model, thesame fonts and even the same software for screen display and printer output.andO;We think that whoever controls screen font technology will also controlprinting--pretty much the reverse of today's reality.andP;  (Our reasoning is setforth in Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  13, pp.andP;  31-36.)andP;  We do not believe that there isroom in the market for very many different standards for font technology.andM;The players today.andP;  Right now, there are five major players, each with itsown font technology, to watch:  Adobe, Apple, Sun, Hewlett-Packard andMicrosoft.andP;  Apple has just made its move, and Adobe has tipped its hand alittle.andM;Sun is putting Folio's F3 software into its workstations, and will licensethe TypeMaker technology to all comers.andP;  It has promised to publish the fontformat so third parties can create fonts for F3.andP;  With the support thatLinotype and Monotype have promised in the form of making fonts for thatformat, F3 could become a very important factor in the market.andM;HP has opted for PCL Level 5, which is based on Compugraphic's Intellifonttechnology.andP;  But PCL Level 5 is not in the field, even as a spec sheet.andP;  Bythe time it is released, the market window may have closed.andM;The biggest question now: what will Microsoft do?andP;  It has promised that OS/2version 2.0 will have scalable screen fonts, but has not picked a technology.andO;The result has been a mad scramble by everyone with font technology toconvince Microsoft to adopt their system.andP;  The stakes are incredibly high;the winner is almost sure to become a dominant industry standard.andM;Objectives.andP;  We would love to see a single, open font standard with a singlefont library and open competition to supply fonts.andP;  We recognize, though,that the industry may not settle on a single winner.andP;  But we are willing tobet that there will be fewer than five; perhaps there will be no more thanthree (Adobe, Apple, Microsoft), and maybe fewer than that.andM;We are also willing to bet that all will ultimately have to be &quot;open&quot;standards with published font formats and automatic conversion andhint-insertion software.andP;  The sales of fonts will be completely decoupledfrom the sale of output devices.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
