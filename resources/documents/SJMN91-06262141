TOM Harkin of Iowa is &quot;the new William Jennings Bryan,&quot; a friend of histold Alex Beam of the Boston Herald.;   Just what the Democrats need -- a newversion of the biggest loser in presidential election history!  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HARKIN FITS WRONG BILL FOR DEMOS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Theo Lippman Jr. writes for the Baltimore Sun.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Harkin, like Bryan, is a populist and a great orator &quot;who could easilyelectrify a convention,&quot; Beam wrote. Yes, and electrocute his party.;   Bryanwas the party's nominee three times, in 1896, 1900 and 1908. He lost toWilliam McKinley in 1896 and 1900 and to William Howard Taft in 1908. He isthe only three-time loser in presidential electoral history.;   Gov. BillClinton of Arkansas knows history. He told University of Arkansas students,&quot;If you run and get the nomination and lose the general election, those peopledon't have a very good record of coming back.&quot;;   They sure don't. In thehistory of Democratic-Republican contests, only two Democrats and twoRepublicans have won the presidential nomination, lost the general election,then been renominated.;   The Democrats: Grover Cleveland was the incumbentpresident in 1884, was renominated but lost to Benjamin Harrison in 1888,re-renominated and beat Harrison in 1892. Adlai Stevenson was nominated in1952 and 1956, losing big to Dwight Eisenhower both times.;   The Republicans:Tom Dewey lost to Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944, was renominated and lost toHarry Truman in 1948. Richard Nixon lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960, wasrenominated in 1968 and won, beating Hubert Humphrey.;   Knowing all this,perhaps wanting to be the new Cleveland, Clinton hinted that he still mightmake a bid in 1992, expecting to lose, hoping to run and win in  1996. &quot;Rulesare made to be broken,&quot; he told the U. of A. students. (He sounds more like aRepublican Supreme Court justice than a Democratic presidential nominee.);  The Democrats need a new Grover Cleveland more than they need a new WilliamJennings Bryan. These times, like those of Bryan and Cleveland, areconservative times. Cleveland was the most conservative Democratic presidentfrom the 1850s till today.;   Mario Cuomo believes the party needs not a newGrover Cleveland, not a new William Jennings Bryan, not a new Adlai Stevenson,but a new Roosevelt.;   Guess who he thinks fills the bill. Cuomo said in arecent interview that FDR was elected president in 1932 because as governor ofNew York he was dealing with problems and conditions that the whole nation wasexperiencing -- just as Cuomo is doing now. But in fact, the whole nation nolonger feels a kinship with New York the way it used to.;   The nation turnsits eyes to Southerners and Westerners to solve its problems now. It has inevery presidential election since 1960 and will again in 1992.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  THEO LIPPMAN JR.  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910918  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  471  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, September 18, 199100262141,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
