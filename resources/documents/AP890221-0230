The mosque's wailing call to prayer drowns out the the toll ofthe church bell, swishing sari robes replace pinstripes and thescents of roast lamb and spice perfume the air in Brick Lane _ the``new world'' for Britain's latest immigrants, people fromBangladesh.   Since the first Bangladeshis stepped off the boats three decadesago, some 30,000 have streamed into this part of London's East End.Like the Jews once predominant here, they have struggled to learnEnglish, find shelter and work, and preserve their culture.   A century ago Brick Lane was an area of infamous squalor, whereJack the Ripper stalked his victims. In World War II it was heavilybombed, and soon Jews began moving out, leaving the low-built housesand narrow streets to what has become the largest singleconcentration of Britain's 160,000 Bangladeshis.   Initially arriving for transient work, they have broughtfamilies, built five mosques in a square-mile area of Tower Hamletsborough and opened leather shops and grocery stores filled withchutneys and mangoes. One mosque used to be a synagogue.   Having laid down roots and grown in number, the Bangladeshis havealso discovered self-assertiveness, and have adopted a higherprofile in demanding their rights as Moslems.   They want more sexual segregation in state-funded schools wheretheir children are in the majority, as well as government money fortheir private schools.   Salman Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses'' became an issue inmid-Februar among the Bangladeshis.   Not all supported Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's call to killRushdie and his publishers. But they were vociferous in denouncingthe novel as an insult to their faith, Islam.   In many ways the issue wasn't about Rushdie's book, said IqbalWahhab, editor of the Asian Herald, an English-language weekly.   ``It was about the reassertion of Moslem values onto Britishsociety which they feel have been ignored.''   The Bangladeshis have begun to shed the immigrant mentality andthink of England as home.   ``Five, 10 years ago, our people send all money to Bangladesh andthink `I'm just working here,''' said Siraz Miah, a 28-year-oldwhose tiny leather factory is up a narrow staircase strewn withleather scraps.   ``Now we think it's our country. Now people have house andbusiness. Now is better.''   His 12 workers stitch 300 jackets a week on old sewing machines,surrounded by head-high piles of hide and the acrid smell ofchemicals. They are among the fortunate. Twenty-seven percent ofEast End Bangladeshis are jobless.   It was factories like this that prompted Prince Charles, during a1987 visit, to liken Brick Lane's workplaces to subcontinentsweatshops.   Something must be done, said the heir to the British throne, andthe business community responded with 1.5 million pounds ($2.6million) in donations for job-creation projects.   Syed Bodrul Islam, who works the Tower Hamlets Center for SmallBusiness, a job-promotion agency, says his focus is with the youngergeneration like Miah.   A former social worker, Islam helps his clients apply forinterest-free loans for businesses, ranging from shops to marketstalls.   ``Many were not educated, even in Bangladesh,'' he added. ``Butthe younger generation are very important.   ``The old people who came years ago have a lot of problems. Theycan't read or write. ... Some came over with 5,000 or 6,000pounds,'' $9,000 to $17,000 in 1960.   Arriving mostly from the Sylhet region of Bangladesh, formerlyEast Pakistan, many early settlers were ship's cooks, with fewskills and little English, who came alone intending to return homesomeday.   Families followed, sometimes nearly a decade later because ofBritain's tightening immigration laws, and a community grew. Nowtheir children speak with Cockney accents.   ``We have heard that Moslem girls choose boyfriends freely and goto discos. It's worrying us _ what comes next?'' said Daslim-Ali, aleader of the East London Mosque near Brick Lane.   Others trust the collective identity forged in Brick Lane toteach the children.   ``Nowadays lots of Bangladeshis are here, so our children knowhow we behave,'' said Taiyabur Rahman, 55, who came in 1959 to openthe first Bangladeshi travel agency in London.   ``As long as our children are with us, they won't be lost.''   But while life improves, problems remain.   Racist violence, a threat wherever Britain's 800,000 Asianimmigrants are clustered, is acute in Tower Hamlets. The TowerHamlets Association for Racial Equality says it received about 2,500complaints of racial harassment in 1987, mostly over beatings andbroken windows. It reported seven arson attacks on Asian homes, noneof which caused injuries.   Speaking little English and a dialect that has no written form,immigrants are often cut off from police, jobs and social services.   With a birthrate five times above the national average, men mustfeed five to seven mouths on the lowest average wage of any ethnicminority in Britain, a 1987 House of Commons report said.   But it noted the ``strengths of the community, particularly itsculture and extent of self-help within families.''   The district still has a few reminders of its Jewish past _ anall-night bagel shop or the J. Minsky and Sons textile store. Butthe Jews do not seem bitter about the newcomers.   Sidney Minsky, whose father started the business in 1902, eagerlyshows a visitor around Asian stores in old tenements.   ``The Asians show you how a business can be run,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Feb. 27</NOTE></DOC>
