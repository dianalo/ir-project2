Fifteen other Arabs were shot and wounded in demonstrations asPalestinians marked the end of the 23rd month of a revolt againstIsraeli rule in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.   A general strike called by underground uprising leadersparalyzed business and traffic and shut schools throughout theoccupied lands.   The army command said a military force on routine duties in theWest Bank town of Nablus spotted a ``suspicious movement'' near ahouse in the Jneid neighborhood before dawn Thursday.   Israel media said troops surrounded the one-story house and useda loudspeaker to order the suspects to come out. When they refused,soldiers broke in through a metal door.   ``There were six young men inside and one pulled out a pistol.He was shot and killed, and the others were arrested and taken forinterrogation,'' an army statement said.   The army said the victim, Iman Mohsein Al Ruzeh, and thedetainees belonged to the Red Eagles, a guerrilla group backed bythe radical Syrian-based Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine, a PLO faction that opposes Yasser Arafat's peaceinitiative.   The army said Al Ruzeh, 23, was wanted for alleged involvementin the assassinations as well as for firebomb attacks, kidnappingsand violent interrogations of suspected collaborators.   It said Jaber Mohammed Suleiman Fuash, 19, wanted by securityforces for involvement in the killing of eight Arabs, was among thedetainees.   The Red Eagles are believed responsible for the slayings of nineNablus Palestinians suspected of ``moral offenses'' or assistingIsraeli authorities, as well as of other attacks against Israelitroops, the army said.   ``The nine were killed after severe torture, including killingsby axes and knives,'' the statement said.   Nablus has been the site of a large portion of slayings of Arabsaccused of helping the Israeli authorities since the uprisingbegan. Of 143 Arabs killed on such charges, 23 were slain inNablus, with most of the slayings blamed on the Red Eagles oranother guerrilla group, the Black Panther Brigades.   Israeli officials claim some of these gangs operate under directorders of the PLO, but Palestinians say at least some of themurders were carried out in defiance of Arafat's orders.   The raid was followed by violent clashes in Nablus in which onePalestinian was killed and four others wounded. An Israeli borderpoliceman suffered moderate injuries in a stone-throwing attackafter which the army clamped a curfew on the city of 120,000, thelargest in the West Bank.   Eleven other Palestinians were shot and wounded in Gaza,hospital officials said.   Thursday's deaths brought to 613 the number of Arabs killed byIsraeli gunfire in the uprising. Forty Israelis have also beenslain.</TEXT></DOC>
