The court also agreed to hear a Reagan administration appealaimed at allowing some creditors to collect more money from debtorswho declare bankruptcy.   The justices also agreed to study the case of a laid-offPennsylvania man in a matter that could decide an important issuefor lawsuits alleging age bias in employment.   In another case, the court refused to let states and localgovernments regulate the prices which most of the nation's cabletelevision operators charge for basic service.   In the anti-racketeering case, the court said it will hear anappeal by phone customers in Minnesota who have accusedNorthwestern Bell Telephone Co. of trying to bribe state publicutility officials.   The phone subcribers sued the company under a law known as theRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).   They said the company beginning in 1980 tried illegally to winrate increases by offering gifts, employment offers, tickets tosporting and cultural events and other favors to members of theMinnesota Public Utilities Commission.   The suit was thrown out by a federal judge and that ruling wasupheld last September by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.   The appeals court said the phone users failed to allege acontinuing pattern of racketeering activity required to make a caseunder the RICO act.   The Supreme Court is being asked to choose among varioustheories of how difficult it should be to maintain such a lawsuit.   In the bankruptcy case, the court said it will review a decisiondenying the government's claim for some interest payments on taxesowed by a bankrupt company.   The case stems from a reorganization petition filed by Ron PairEnterprises before a bankruptcy judge in Detroit in 1984.   The government said the company owed $53,278 in taxes, penaltiesand interest accrued prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition.   The company agreed to pay the amount, but refused to payadditional interest accrued after the bankruptcy filing.   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against thegovernment in September. Justice Department lawyers said theappeals court ruling could prove costly to the government.   In the age discrimination case, the justices agreed to decidewhether Eugene F. Brieck's lawsuit against his former employer,Harbison-Walker Refractories, should proceed to a jury trial.   In July 1982, several employees of Harbison-Walker's Iron andSteel Marketing Support Group were laid off, including Brieck. Hethen was 55.   Brieck sued Harbison-Walker in Pittsburgh in 1984, contendingthat he was laid off and not recalled to work because of his age.   U.S. District Judge Gerald J. Weber threw out Brieck's suit, butthe 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated Brieck's suit lastJune 19.   In the cable TV case, the court, without comment, rejectedarguments that the deregulation effected in 1986 by Congress andthe Federal Communications Commission left subscribers vulnerableto illegal monopoly pricing.   Most of the nation's 7,800 cable TV operators provide both basicand ``premium'' services. For an extra monthly fee, subscribersreceive channels offering exclusive sports and movie programming.   Prior to 1984, the FCC allowed local communities to regulate therates charged for basic cable service but not for premium servicerates.   Congress in 1984 enacted the Cable Communications Policy Act,which lets local authorities regulate basic cable rates only in theabsence of ``effective competition.''   Defining ``effective competition'' was left up to the FCC, andthe commission's definition paved the way for the deregulation ofbasic-service rates charged by more than 90 percent of all cableoperators.   The appeal acted on Monday was filed by lawyers for Connecticut,New York City, the National League of Cities and the American CivilLiberties Union.   Lawyers for the commission and the cable operators associationurged the justices to reject the appeal.   In other cases, the court:   _Agreed to consider killing a key provision of a law designed topromote competitive bidding on government contracts. At issue isthe proper boundary between presidential and congressional power.   _Refused to let the Dalkon Shield's maker set up a $15 millionemergency fund to help women who say the contraceptive device leftthem infertile. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling thatblocks creation of the fund pending the outcome of bankruptcyproceedings for A.H. Robins Co. Inc., which manufactures the device.   _Agreed to decide whether an airline may be forced to reinstateworkers when their strike ends, making necessary the layoffs oftrainees and employees who crossed the picket lines. The court saidit will study an appeal by Trans World Airlines in a disputestemming from a 1986 strike by flight attendants.   _Let stand a ruling that makes it easier for investors to suetheir brokers over the collapse in 1984 of a $3 billion oil andnatural gas investment fund.   _Agreed to decide in a case from Texas whether states may imposesales taxes on most books, newspapers and magazines while exemptingreligious publications.</TEXT></DOC>
