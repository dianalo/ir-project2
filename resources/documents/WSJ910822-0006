On Monday, reports that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachevhad been ousted caused prices of most German, French andJapanese government bonds to crumble. Meanwhile, prices ofshort-term U.S. Treasury bills and notes advanced in a&quot;flight-to-quality&quot; rally. In times of political upheaval,international investors often sell stocks and othersecurities and buy short-term Treasurys, viewed as the safestand highest-quality securities in the world.</LP><TEXT>   But all of that was reversed yesterday as news filteredout about the apparent collapse of the coup. As prices ofinternational bonds rose, prices of short-term U.S. Treasurysdeclined.   &quot;We lost the flight-to-quality premium in the two-yearnotes,&quot; says Matthew Alexy, senior analyst at Deutsche BankGovernment Securities Inc. &quot;People are extending back out onthe {yield} curve. The long bond has a firm tone.&quot;   Prices of long-term U.S. Treasurys benefited from arenewed focus on the weak condition of the domestic economyand perceptions that interest rates will eventually comedown. That allowed long-term bonds to post modest gains.   The U.S. bond market's bellwether security, the 30-yearTreasury bond, ended more than 1/4 point higher, a gain ofmore than $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. Theissue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of itsprice, fell to 8.06% from 8.08% on Tuesday.   In Germany, the benchmark 10-year bond rose 3/4 point, apartial recovery from Monday's severe 1 1/2 point decline.The benchmark Japanese government bond was up 0.30 pointyesterday following a modest gain on Tuesday and a nearlyone-point decline on Monday.   Despite yesterday's advance in international bonds, &quot;themarket is still jittery and vulnerable to bad news, but stillit appears more willing to trade on good than on bad news,&quot;said Robert Rennie, an analyst at Midland Montagu Securitiesin London.   Meanwhile, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. said it changedthe asset allocation in its Global Balance Portfolio byreducing the bond allocation to 30% from 40% while raisingthe stock allocation to 65% from 55%. The 5% cash allocationwas unchanged.   Steven Nagourney, a global strategist at Shearson, saidthe change doesn't reflect fear that European and U.S. bondswill be bad investments. Indeed, Mr. Nagourney believes thatinterest rates may well continue to decline in manycountries.   However, he said that stocks are likely to be much betterinvestments than bonds in the foreseeable future. Theapparent failure of the coup in the Soviet Union, said Mr.Nagourney, &quot;has totally discredited the military old guard.&quot;He expects the creation of market economies in Eastern Europeand the Soviet Union will move swiftly because the threat ofcivil war in the Soviet Union appears to be removed. Theprospect of civil war, &quot;was an enormous uncertainty,&quot; hesaid. But now, Mr. Nagourney believes that companies willinvest in Eastern Europe more confidently, benefiting stocks.   Shearson said it will reduce its allocation to the U.S.and most other countries in its model, except Japan. Althoughyields in Japan are lower than in many other countries aroundthe world, Mr. Nagourney said there is potential for strongprice appreciation in Japanese bonds due to growing concernsabout the health of Japanese banks. Due to these fears,&quot;investors will not want to keep money in banks. They aremoving more money out of banks and into bonds,&quot; said Mr.Nagourney. Such buying should help to lift prices, he said.   On the stock side, Shearson raised its allocation tostocks in the U.S., France, Spain, Switzerland and the U.K.Shearson reduced its allocation to stocks in Australia, NewZealand and Japan.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds   Dr Pepper Co. sold $200 million of high-risk junk bondsyesterday, marking the second time in a week that a low-ratedjunk bond issuer has successfully tapped the high-yieldmarket.   Dr Pepper, the operating unit of Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Cos.,offered $150 million of five-year guaranteed senior notes inthe public market.   In a separate transaction, the soft-drink concern alsoplaced $50 million of floating-rate notes with privateinvestors.   The successful junk bond sales come a week after AmericanMedical International Inc. managed to sell $210 million ofjunk bonds in a deal that was primarily geared to high-yieldinvestors.   While the junk bond market has seen several double-B-ratedissuers sell bonds this year, American Medical and Dr Pepperare the first single-B-rated concerns to tap the market.Double-B-rated companies are considered to be the top-qualityissuers in the $210 billion high-yield market.   Though some portfolio managers and analysts complainedthat the 11.50% coupon rate on the Dr Pepper notes was ratherlow, junk bond traders say the new notes met with strongdemand in secondary market trading. The notes, priced at par,jumped one point to end at 101.   Martin Fridson, head of high-yield research at MerrillLynch andamp; Co., said that the success of the American Medicaland Dr Pepper deals indicates that investors are morereceptive to lower-rated speculative-grade bond deals thanthey were earlier this year.   However, &quot;The fact that you don't have a lot of deals inthe pipeline shows that while investors are easing up, theyare not losing sight of credit quality,&quot; said Mr. Fridson.   The successful Dr Pepper junk bond sale represents thefirst public high-yield bond deal underwritten by BTSecurities Corp. since its parent, Bankers Trust New YorkCorp., was awarded expanded underwriting powers by theFederal Reserve two years ago. When the junk bond collapsedin the fall of 1989, BT Securities was forced to withdraw a$150 million high-yield offering for Morningstar Foods Inc.   The junk bond sale was part of a $250 million refinancingby Dr Pepper. In addition to the high-risk high-yield bonds,Dr Pepper sold $50 million of senior exchangeable preferredstock priced with a dividend yield of 13.75% throughunderwriters at Prudential Securities Inc.   Net proceeds from both the stock and junk bond sales willbe used to repay bank debt and to pay a one-time cashdividend of about $84 million to the holding company, DrPepper/Seven-Up. The dividend will help the holding companymeet the interest costs on the $541 million of 15.50% seniorsubordinated discount notes due in 1998. Those zero-couponnotes start paying cash interest in April 1993.   In the broader high-yield market, junk bonds gained aseuphoria over the apparent collapse of the Soviet coup pushedprices higher. Most junk bonds finished 1/4 to 3/8 pointhigher.   Elsewhere, in the high-yield market, junk bonds ofHarcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. jumped again after the giantpublisher said it has halted trading in its stock pendingnews.   The stock didn't open yesterday nor did the stock ofmovie-theater chain General Cinema Corp. Analysts believe thetwo companies are discussing the possibility of merging. InApril, General Cinema withdrew a $1.4 billion bid forHarcourt Brace. The talks collapsed when the company couldn'treach an accord with bondholders.   But now, &quot;clearly people are speculating that GeneralCinema is coming back to the table with a better offer {forHarcourt} than they had several months ago,&quot; said JohnShippee, a high-yield analyst at BT Securities.   Harcourt Brace's 13.75% subordinated debentures, maturingin 1999, jumped one point, or $10 for a bond with a $1,000face amount, to end at 81. The bonds jumped three pointsTuesday.   Meanwhile, Harcourt Brace's 13% senior notes, due in 1997,also chalked up one point to end at 91 after rising by 1 1/2points Tuesday.   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, bonds endedmixed.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasurys were mixed with short-term bills and notesposting price declines while long-term bonds posted gains.   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of100 20/32 to yield 8.06%, up in price from 100 10/32 to yield8.08%. Among short-term securities, two-year notes ended at101 5/32 to yield 6.21%, down in price from 101 11/32 toyield 6.11%.   Rates on Treasury bills, some of which slipped below 5% onMonday, were sharply higher yesterday. The average discountrate on three-month bills ended at 5.29% for abond-equivalent yield of 5.43% compared with a rate of 5.12%on Tuesday to yield 5.25%. The rate on six-month bills endedat 5.28% for a bond-equivalent yield of 5.49% compared with arate of 5.15% to yield 5.35% on Tuesday.   Michael Moran, government trading manager at Donaldson,Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said that short-termsecurities weren't helped by the announcement of new supplycoming to the market next week. The Treasury said it willsell $12.50 billion of two-year notes Tuesday and $9.25billion of five-year notes Wednesday.   Mr. Moran said that the size of the monthly auctions wasentirely predictable, but, nonetheless, stalled any remaininghopes of a continued rally in the short end of the market.   In when-issued trading, which kicked off immediately afterthe annoucement, yields on the two-year notes were quotedlate at 6.24%. The five-year notes were quoted late at7.265%.   On the economic calendar for today, initial claims forstate unemployment benefits for the week of Aug. 10 will bereleased. Economists polled by Dow Jones Capital MarketsReport expect the report to show a 4,000 rise. Later in theday, the Federal Reserve releases money supply data for theweek ended Aug. 12. The bond market is expected to watch thisdata closely for signs of continued weak monetary growth and,consequently, hopes that the Fed might consider loweringinterest rates to boost the economy.                                                                                                          Municipal Securities                                                                                                          Prices of municipal bonds finished little changed.   Among actively traded issues, the Florida State Board ofEducation's 6.75% securities of 2021 finished unchanged onthe day at 98 5/8 to yield 6.85%.   In primary activity, an aggressive pricing dampenedinvestor interest in California's $602 million offering oftaxable general obligation bonds.   The top yield on the offering, 8.15% for bonds maturing in2001, came at a spread of just 0.34 percentage points abovethe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note at the time ofthe noon EDT pricing.   Prior to the offering, dealers had anticipated that thebonds maturing in 2001 would carry a spread of 0.40 to 0.50percentage point above the 10-year note.   Won by an underwriting group led by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.,the issue was California's first taxable muni offering andthe largest taxable muni deal in the market's history. Therange of yields for the bonds, maturing in 1992-2001, was5.85% in 1992 to 8.15% in 2001.   Late yesterday, Goldman officials reported that about halfthe issue was unsold.   A Goldman official said the triple-A-rated deal attracteda mix of traditional taxable bond buyers, such as bond fundsand insurance companies. In-state retail buyers, takingadvantage of the bonds' exemption from California personalincome taxes, also purchased the securities, the officialsaid.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Prices of mortgage-backed securities ended higher.   Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities forSeptember delivery were up 9/32 at 101 25/32.   The Treasury's 10-year note, the issue most closelytracked by the mortgage market, was up 1/32 at 100 15/32 toyield 7.79%.   With mortgage securities far outpacing the ten-year note,the spread between the two issues has narrowed, reversing therecent widening trend that was exacerbated by the flight toquality spurred by the turmoil in the Soviet Union.   The spread of the Ginnie Mae 9% issue's yield above thatof the 10-year note was 1.07 percentage points, compared with1.11 percentage points Tuesday.   In other mortgage markets, Federal Home Loan MortgageCorp. Gold 9% securities were at 101 18/32, up 6/32. FederalNational Mortgage Association 9% securities were also up6/32, at 101 10/32.</TEXT></DOC>
