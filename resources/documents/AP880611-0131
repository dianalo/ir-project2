Ortega told a group of factory workers in Managua that theUnited States was seeking ``to make dust of the peace plan, to burnit, incinerate it.''   He claimed that rebel leaders met in Washington with ElliottAbrams, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs,several days before last week's three days of negotiations to workout a strategy ``to kill the peace plan.''   But he said his Sandinista government is prepared ``to continuediscussing outstanding points in the negotiating process'' with therebels.   Both the Sandinistas and rebels appear to be pegging their peaceproposals on Washington's reaction after the collapse on Thursdayof the latest round of talks.   It is believed the Sandinistas hope to achieve a peace pact withthe rebels, known as Contras, before the Reagan administrationleaves office next year. President Reagan is a strong backer of theContras and a peace agreement could dim if not eliminate prospectsfor renewed U.S. military aid to the rebels.   And the Contras say the possibility of a resumption of such aidputs pressure on the government to accept democratic reforms.   The fourth round of talks failed last week to find an end to thewar that has been waged for more than six years. Although theContras said there would be no further meetings, it appeared thatthey left the door ajar.   Alfredo Cesar, the head of the Contra delegation, said Thursdayas the talks broke off, ``We have reiterated our deep conviction tolooking to solutions to the conflict in our motherland in acivilized way.''   Contra leader Adolfo Calero was in Washington last week and wasquoted by the rebels' Radio Liberacion as saying, ``The armed roadis the only option left for democratization in Nicaragua.''   A Contra plan submitted Thursday was described by the governmentas ``irrational.'' It called on the Sandinistas to disband theSupreme Court, revise the public security law, rewrite theelectoral laws and set up an assembly to rewrite the 1987constitution.   The White House put the blame for the breakdown of the talks onSandinista ``intransigence.'' Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said theReagan administration was studying renewed military aid to therebels.   Washington had backed and trained the rebels covertly or withcongressional approval since 1981. Military aid legally stoppedFeb. 29, and Congress voted down Reagan's request for more warfunding.   The U.S. Congress last approved Contra military aid in June1986. The Soviet bloc and Cuba support the Sandinistas.   On the first of three days of talks last week, the Sandinistadelegation claimed the rebels wanted the negotiations to fail topave the way for new U.S. militlary aid.   A cease-fire has been in effect since March 21, but both sideshave accused the other of violations.   The Sandinistas' 80,000-member armed forces have continued toreceive Soviet military goods and it is believed the Contras, saidto number between 6,000 and 10,000, have been stockpiling suppliesand weapons during the fragile truce.   The Sandinistas have been in power since July 1979 afterdefeating the forces of right-wing President Anastasio Somoza in acivil war.</TEXT></DOC>
