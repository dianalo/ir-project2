The Departmenthas now completed that administrative review in accordance with section751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the Tariff Act'').<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Review</ITAG>The United States, under the auspices of the Customs Cooperation Council,has developed a system of tariff classification based on the internationalharmonized system of Customs nomenclature. On January 1, 1989, the UnitedStates fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS), as providedfor in section 1201 <T3>et seq. </T3>of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS item number(s).Imports covered by the review are shipments from Sweden of cold-rolledcarbon steel flat-rolled products, whether or not corrugated or crimped;whether or not pickled; not cut, not pressed, and not stamped to non-rectangularshape; not coated or plated with metal and not clad; over 12 inches inwidth and of any thickness; whether or not in coils. During the reviewperiod, such merchandise was classifiable under item numbers 607.8320,607.8350, 607.8355 and 607.8360 of the Tariff Schedules of the United StatesAnnotated. These products are currently classifiable under HTS item numbers7209.11.00, 7209.12.00, 7209.13.00, 7209.21.00, 7209.22.00, 7209.23.00,7209.24.50, 7209.31.00, 7209.32.00, 7209.33.00, 7209.34.00, 7209.41.00,7209.43.00, 7209.44.00, 7209.90.00, 7211.30.50, 7211.41.70 and 7211.49.50.The review covers the period March 20, 1985 through December 31, 1985 and10 programs: (1) Regional development incentives; (2) reconstruction loans;(3) structural loans; (4) government equity infusions; (5) government equityguarantees; (6) government acquisitions of assets for SSAB; (7) researchand development grants; (8) employment promotion grants; (9) governmentexport credits; and (10) municipal and county subsidies.Sventsk Stall SB (``SSAB'') was the only Swedish exporter of the subjectmerchandise to the United States during the period or review.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments Received</ITAG>We invited interested parties to comment on the preliminary results. Atthe request of the respondent, SSAB, we held a public hearing on January12, 1989.<T3>Comment 1: </T3>SSAB contends that the Department should not evaluateSSAB's equityworthiness based on the past financial results of the investingcompanies. SSAB was formed through an asset acquisition, not a merger,and there were no appropriate financial statements for evaluating SSAB'sequityworthiness at the time of its formation in 1978. Instead, the Departmentshould evaluate the Government of Sweden's equity infusion on the basisof the soundness of the investment. The fact that two private companies,Granges and Stora Kopparbergs (Stora), invested in SSAB indicates thatSSAB was a prudent investment for the Government of Sweden as well. Themajor precondition for the government's financing of SSAB was that an extensiverestructuring should be carried out in the Swedish carbon steel industryaimed at improving productivity and profitability.SSAB further contends that the Department's focus on considerations thatwould motivate a hypothetical U.S. investor to determine whether SSAB wasunequityworthy is incorrect. The equityworthiness of SSAB must be approachedfrom the point of view of a Swedish investor. Unlike a U.S. investor, aSwedish investor would have placed more emphasis on asset values than onearnings potential. The Department also failed to take into considerationthat the steel industry is capital-intensive and, as such, not likely toyield quick profits.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> SSAB was formed in 1978 as a joint-venturebetween Granges AB and Stora (both privately-owned), Statsfore-tag/NorbottensJarnverk AB (NJA) (government-owned) and the Government of Sweden. Underthe terms of the formation agreement, Granges, Stora and NJA each transferredto SSAB steel assets valued at 700 million Swedish kronor (MSEK) in exchangefor 25 percent shares of SSAB stock. The government also contributed 700MSEK in cash in exchange for a 25 percent share of SSAB stock. We have consistently held that government provision of equity <T3>per se </T3>does not confer a subsidy. Government equity infusionsare countervailable only when they occur on terms inconsistent with commercialconsiderations. Where there is no market-determined price for the shares,it is necessary to assess the prospects of the company at the time of theinvestment. Although the steel industry is capital-intensive, any privateinvestor motivated by commercial considerations would invest in a companyif the investment is expected to yield a reasonable rate of return withina reasonable period of time. Because Granges and Stora invested in SSAB does not necessarily make SSABa reasonable commercial investment. During the 1970's, the overall demandfor steel in Sweden was virtually stagnant while at the same time importsincreased annually at an average rate of five percent. As a result, Swedishsteel-producing companies faced excessive inventory build-up, reduced salesand low profitability or losses. In an effort to become competitive, Grangesand Stora entered into a joint venture with NJA by combining their commercial-gradecarbon steel-producing assets while the Government of Sweden provided capital.The companies invested in SSAB to concentrate operations, increase efficiencyand competitiveness and remain going concerns. They were not disinterestedinvestors objectively evaluating the potential return on their investment.In analyzing the formation of SSAB and the government's initial investment,we examined the report of an official commission that studied the Swedishcarbon steel industry, entitled ``The Commercial Steel Industry in theDecade of the 1980's.'' We also analyzed a five-year forecast for SSABfor the period 1978 through 1982 that was based, in part, on the commission'sreport. The forecast projected that SSAB would not begin making a profituntil 1982. The financial data and the economic condition of the steel industry atthe time of the equity investment indicated the following: (1) That SSABwas projected to become profitable at the end of its fifth year, with noprojections beyond 1982, (2) that the anticipated rate of return on equity,based on the projected profit, would be too low to provide a reasonablerate of return on investment, and (3) that the demand for Swedish steelin the home and export market remained uncertain. Based on this information,we determined that the Government of Sweden's 1978 equity investment inSSAB was not made in accordance with commercial considerations. <T3>Comments 2: </T3>SSAB contends that the provision of a promissory noteto SSAB by the Government of Sweden for the purchase of a railroad fromGranges did not benefit SSAB. Two independent studies prepared in 1977assessed the value of the assets transferred from Granges, Stora and NJA,to be relatively equal. The three investing companies negotiated a figureof 700 MSEK as the value for the assets each transferred, and the 700 MSEKof assets transferred from Granges to SSAB included the railroad. The transferof Granges' steel, mining and railroad assets would have resulted in anunsustainable book loss for Granges. Therefore, the Swedish governmentdecided to offset this book loss by making the railroad transfer a separatetransaction. Granges required 480 MSEK to cover the difference betweenthe book value and the transfer value of its steel assets to SSAB. Thenote was never carried on SSAB's financial statement because payments weremade directly to Granges by the government. Accordingly, it was Granges,not SSAB, that benefited from the transfer. SSAB, by signing over the noteto Granges, was simply a conduit between the government and Granges. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. The SSAB formation agreementstates that Granges would transfer its railroad to SSAB in exchange for480 MSEK. Payment of the 480 MSEK to Granges consisted of SSAB's assumptionof Granges railroad pension liabilities, and the National Debt Office'sissuance of a 12-year promissory note for 343.3 MSEK bearing interest of8.25 percent per annum. The government made a special authorization offunds with which to pay off the promissory note and, because SSAB signedover the note issued on its behalf to Granges, the government makes paymentsdirectly to Granges. Since the Government of Sweden is paying off the promissorynote and SSAB is relieved of a debt obligation that it otherwise wouldhave assumed, we determined that the 343.3 MSEK promissory note confersa benefit on SSAB. <T3>Comment 3: </T3>SSAB contends that the government's payment of 530MSEK to NJA did not confer a benefit on SSAB. NJA incurred a book lossbecause (1) the book value of its steel assets transferred to SSAB exceededthe negotiated price of 700 MSEK, (2) it had an operating loss for 1977,and (3) it abandoned its ``steel works 80'' employment project. The write-offof steel assets on NJA's balance sheet was offset by the government's paymentof 530 MSEK to NJA. If the government had not made the payment to NJA,the company would have had to liquidate. The government payment was neededonly to keep NJA a viable corporation. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>NJA, a government-owned company, transferredsteel assets to SSAB. In return, NJA received stock from SSAB valued at700 MSEK and cash of 530 MSEK from the government. Since the transfer ofNJA's steel assets to SSAB was conditioned on NJA's receiving 530 MSEKfrom the government (to cover the loss in book value of the assets transferredto SSAB), we consider the 530 MSEK to be an assumption of cost by the governmenton behalf of SSAB. Therefore, we determine that the 530 MSEK contributedby the government to effect this transfer confers a countervailable benefiton SSAB.<T3>Comment 4:</T3> SSAB contends that the Department incorrectly foundSSAB to be unequityworthy in 1981 when additional equity was provided bythe investing companies and the Government of Sweden. Financial projectionsat the time of SSAB's creation forecast that SSAB would need additionalfunds in 1981 to cover losses. In 1981, the additional capital was requiredpartly to cover the projected losses and also to restore SSAB's debt/equityratio, which had been affected by SSAB's acquisition of the TIBNOR groupof companies. The Department's conclusion that Stora relinquished its sharesin SSAB rather than investing additional capital in 1981 is incorrect.Stora chose to forego new investment in SSAB because of other financialcommitments, and its decision to relinquish its shares in SSAB at thistime does not indicate that SSAB was unequityworthy.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. At the time of the government's1981 equity infusion, SSAB was not operating profitably. However, SSAB'ssuccessive losses from 1978 through 1980 did not reduce the company's equitybase because the Government of Sweden allowed SSAB to cover these lossesand maintain its equity by converting funds from its reconstruction loansin an amount equal to each year's losses to the equity account. SSAB'sactual losses for 1978 through 1980 exceeded the projected losses. As aresult, the government approved an additional reconstruction loan to coverthe losses for 1981. Because SSAB's return on equity continued to be negativeand the prospects of the world steel industry remained precarious, we determinethat the Government of Sweden's 1981 equity investment in SSAB was notmade in accordance with commercial considerations.<T3>Comment 5:</T3> SSAB claims that the agreement between the Governmentof Sweden and Granges to purchase Granges shares in 1991 has not been correctlycharacterized or countervailed by the Department. As part of the 1981 transactionsto provide SSAB with needed capital, the government agreed to redeem Granges'shares in SSAB in 1991 for the sum of 875 MSEK, provided that SSAB hadnot declared bankruptcy or gone into liquidation. The 875 MSEK figure representeda new investment of 375 MSEK, with interest compounded at approximately10 percent per annum for nine years. However, the long-term rate of intereston Swedish government obligations in 1981 was 13.5 percent. Therefore,the government's conditional promise to pay Granges 875 MSEK in 1991 wasworth considerably less than 375 MSEK in 1981.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We did not compare Granges' guaranteedrate of return to a long-term interest rate on Swedish obligations becausewe are treating the additional 375 MSEK investment by Granges in SSAB asequity, not as a loan. In our final determination (50 FR 33375; August19, 1985), we treated the funds provided by Granges to SSAB as a loan.We have reconsidered this approach and have concluded that the transactionis not equivalent to a loan because SSAB is not obligated to repay thefunds. We treated the 375 MSEK as an equity infusion that the governmentprovided indirectly (through Granges) to SSAB. Because we have determinedthat SSAB was unequityworthy in 1981, this equity infusion bestows a countervailablebenefit on SSAB.<T3>Comment 6:</T3> SSAB requests that the Department test the conditionalreconstruction loans as grants to make sure that they have not been excessivelycountervailed.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We have determined that the amount of countervailingduties calculated for the conditional reconstruction loans is significantlylower than if we had treated these loans as grants.<T3>Comment 7:</T3> SSAB argues that the employment promotion grants arenot countervailable. In the final determination of <T3>Certain Stainless Steel Hollow Products from Sweden</T3> (52 FR 5794;February 26, 1987), the Department found the same program not countervailable.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> In <T3>Certain Stainless Steel Hollow Products from Sweden,</T3> we foundthat the companies in question were not relieved of any obligations theyotherwise would have incurred absent the employment promotion grants. Inthis case, we were not provided with such information and cannot ascertainwhat SSAB's costs and obligations would have been absent grants under thisprogram. Therefore, as best information available, we conclude that theGovernment of Sweden is assuming costs that SSAB otherwise would have hadto pay and that this program confers a countervailable domestic subsidy.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Results of Review</ITAG>After considering all of the comments received, we determine the net subsidyduring the period March 20, 1985 to December 31, 1985 to be 4.58 percent<T3>ad valorem.</T3>The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess countervailingduties of 4.58 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments ofthis merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumptionon or after March 20, 1985, and exported on or before December 31, 1985.The Department will instruct the Customs Service to collect a cash depositof estimated countervailing duties of 4.58 percent of the f.o.b. invoiceprice on all shipments of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice.
