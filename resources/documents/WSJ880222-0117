That, they say, could thrust the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries into a crucial new test -- possibly resulting in a special meeting of the oil ministers for another try at restraining their production. After dropping sharply in January, OPEC output is beginning to creep up again despite high world oil inventories.    &quot;Inventory drawdowns are so small, it looks like we are getting into real trouble,&quot; said a Venezuelan oil official who is a member of that country's delegation to OPEC. &quot;But we are not expecting a special meeting,&quot; he said, &quot;unless there is a crisis,&quot; which he defined as a sharp drop in prices below $15 a barrel.    Prices of some OPEC crudes already are below $15. Spot prices of the basket of seven crudes used by OPEC to set its official $18 benchmark more than a year ago currently average only $15.50. World oil prices, including those for non-OPEC crudes, average about $16 a barrel, down nearly $4 from last year's peak.    But there's also evidence that oil markets could firm again by late in the second quarter -- if the industry and OPEC can muddle through the next few weeks without triggering another price crash similar to that of two years ago. That's because of a new &quot;seasonality&quot; pattern apparently shaping up for oil inventories, OPEC production and petroleum prices -- down in the first half, up in the second, as in 1987.    Nevertheless, it's the pricing outlook for the short term -- through the second quarter -- that concerns the industry, according to a broad sampling of oilmen and OPEC representatives from around the world who were here last week for an annual series of conferences. &quot;There's so much oil around,&quot; said a U.S. refiner, &quot;that we are in a dial-a-cargo environment.&quot; A Kuwait Petroleum Corp. official cited &quot;worries about $14 oil.&quot;    Last week's annual dinner, luncheons and other functions of the British Institute of Petroleum were crowded to capacity. The scores of private meetings and parties were as lively as ever. But there were fewer hospitality suites. And most of the 4,000 to 5,000 oilmen here for the so-called IP Week headed home in a somber mood.    &quot;These people are going back to spread the word oil prices are slipping,&quot; said Peter Gignoux, London oil analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. &quot;We are going to have a rough ride for crude.&quot;    Some industry representatives remaining here for a Banque Paribas energy conference today may not find much there to cheer about either. Humphrey Harrison, a London oil analyst for Banque Paribas Capital Markets, expects oil prices, after weakening short term, will remain in a $13 to $17 range over the next two years or so. The reason, he said, is that OPEC members, particularly the Persian Gulf countries, have chosen to defend their own output volumes rather than support the price.    OPEC seems to be behaving well so far this year on production, with its 13 members generally staying within their assigned quotas. Total production fell in January to about 17 million barrels a day from 18.7 million in December. But that was less because of design by OPEC than restraint by buyers who have been awaiting lower prices before signing 1988 contracts.    Preliminary estimates for this month suggest OPEC production is rising again as more exporters cave in to customers by offering pricing incentives. Petro-Logistics Ltd., a Geneva consulting firm that tracks OPEC production weekly, estimates total output is now 17.6 million barrels a day.    Most expect that OPEC production will exceed 17 million barrels a day for the first quarter. But Lawrence Goldstein, executive vice president of New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, estimated the first-quarter demand for OPEC oil will be substantially less than 17 million, by as much as 500,000 barrels a day. &quot;This means,&quot; he said, &quot;we will be drawing (down) inventories at a slower rate than we should.&quot; That suggests the high inventory &quot;overhang&quot; that is helping depress oil markets won't shrink as rapidly as expected.    OPEC so far has avoided the cut-rate pricing that brought on the crash of two years ago, however, and Mr. Goldstein doesn't expect a return to the &quot;environment of 1986.&quot; He sees Saudi Arabia as the &quot;key to market direction&quot; over the near term. &quot;The Saudis,&quot; he said, &quot;do not want another price free fall.&quot;    A Saudi oil official agreed. &quot;We don't want to depress the price to $15,&quot; he said. He does expect the price to drop further over the next few weeks but then turn up. Juan Chacin, president of Petroleos de Venezuela, also doesn't expect oil prices to deteriorate much more. &quot;We may already have hit bottom here -- maybe in January or February,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
