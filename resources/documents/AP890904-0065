A guerrilla spokesman, Abdul Rahim, said about 7,000 rebelfighters have dug in to the north and south of the beseiged town,about 10 miles south of the Pakistan border.   Rahim said rebels, who call themselves mujahedeen, or Islamicholy warriors, routed government troops fighting to retake Daragai,a critical outpost about three miles south of Khost.   Slightly further south, a second outpost at Willim is under rebelseige, said Rahim. A mujahedeen field commander returning toPakistan from Khost said more than 170 Afghan army soldiers defectedduring fighting at Willim.   Meanwhile, government jetfighters have been pounding rebelpositions and lobbing hundreds of shells at advancing guerrillas,said a second spokesman, Abdul Kabir.   ``There has been constant bombing and shelling,'' he said.   A rebel victory at Khost, the last border post of any size stillin Communist government hands, would open a direct link to rebelfighters in western and northern Afghanistan, said Rahim.   Rebel convoys supplied at depots in Pakistan are now forced totake long and circuitous routes around Khost.   U.S.-backed rebels have been fighting to topple successiveCommunist governments for 11 years. Soviet soldiers fought alongside their Afghan allies for nine of those years, but withdrew onFeb. 15 under a U.N.-brokered accord.   Meanwhile, rebels also reported an attack on a major governmentmilitary air base at Shindand in western Afghanistan. There were noreports of casualties, but rebel sources said the base was badlydamanaged.</TEXT></DOC>
