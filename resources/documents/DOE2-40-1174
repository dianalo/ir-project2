It is found that the realpart of the nuclear forward Compton amplitude in the region of the {Delta}(1232)resonance has its zero at a universal energy {omega}/sub 0/{approx_equal}327+-5MeV throughout the periodic table. This fact can be used to arrive ata representation of the Gell-Mann, Goldberger and Thirring sum rule.</TEXT></DOC>
