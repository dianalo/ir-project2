Now, officialsacknowledge the Soviet Union has the fastest-growing crime rate inthe world and say they are alarmed.   Lawbreaking was up 50 percent in some areas this year. To cope,the KGB secret police has been enlisted to combat racketeering andlawmakers endorsed an emergency anti-crime program.   In crime increases,``lamentably, the Soviet Union is now No.1,'' said Gennady V. Dashkov, an official at a Moscow-basedresearch institute affiliated with the state prosecutor's office.   In the Central Russian city of Gorky, workers created vigilantegroups called ``workers militias'' to combat crime. In Moscow, newFrench-built armored cars now pick up the day's receipts from largestores and savings banks.   Despite such measures, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told theSupreme Soviet legislature Monday that the increase in crimecontinues.   ``One cannot fail to see that although law enforcement bodieshave begun to operate more boldly and actively, and the public hasbegun to support them more, it is too early to speak of aturnaround,'' Gorbachev said. ``Crime is still on the rise.''   Soviet newspapers are peppered with the litany of offenses: thefirebombing of a Moscow restaurant _ allegedly by racketeers _ bankheists in Armenia and Moscow, and bands of roving toughs who beatup well-dressed Muscovites.   Soviet car owners have long removed windshield wipers to thwartpetty thieves, but drivers report brazen robbers now steal thewindshields themselves for resale on a black market in car parts.   The crime wave is a shock to many, in part because thegovernment's long-time penchant for distorting or concealing theseamy details of Soviet life makes public acknowledgement of anyproblem the more startling.   In addition, officials say the uncertainties and shifting socialand economic rules of Gorbachev's domestic reforms are a directcause of the growing crime problem.   ``World practice shows that this situation is typical of anysociety living through a transitional period,'' the nation's toppoliceman, Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin, told the officialSoviet news agency, Tass, recently.   Bakatin's deputy, Vasily Trushin, went on state televisionearlier this month to tell people the problem is nationwide andthat crime is increasing in each of the country's 15 republics.   In the first eight months of 1989, more than 1.5 million crimeswere reported in the Soviet Union, a 33.2 percent jump over thesame period last year, Trushin said.   In the Baltic republics of Lithuania and Estonia, where crimehad been rare, reports of lawbreaking were up 50 percent, he said.   Most worrisome to Soviets is the leap in ``grave crimes,''including violent offenses such as murder, rape and robbery thatonce were considered afflictions of the United States and otherWestern societies.   In the first eight months of 1989, ``grave crimes'' increased40.8 percent, even faster than the overall Soviet crime rate,Trushin said.   He said crime statistics are influenced by other social forces,which for years were contained by the police state but are beingvented in the less repressive climate instituted by Gorbachev.Ethnic strife, for instance, has had a dramatic impact on crimestatistics.   Trushin said that in one week in the Nagorno-Karabakh district,scene of a long-running jurisdictional dispute between therepublics of Azerbaijan and Armenia, 16 attacks on cars wereregistered, along with one murder, six cases of arson and 60 bodilyinjuries.   The official alarm about crime contrasts starkly withMarxist-Leninist orthodoxy about the origins of illegal behavior.   In 1987, two years after Gorbachev came to power, the Sovietbook ``Fundamentals of Criminalists'' declared, ``Having appearedunder exploitation of man by man, crime can be eliminated onlyafter doing away with exploitation. ...Hence in the U.S.S.R. thereare realistic objective conditions for eradicating crime.''   Soviet criminologists have now discarded that thinking, perhapsin part because the present rise in crime could imply thatGorbachev's economic and political reforms permit more exploitation.   ``A man kills his wife, say out of jealousy,'' Dashkov said inan interview. ``That's going to exist under socialism just likeunder capitalism.''   Like Gorbachev, he and other researchers at the All-UnionResearch Institute on the Problems of Strengthening Legality expectthe trend to continue.   ``The rise will stop when Soviet people are certain thattomorrow will be better than today, that they won't be unemployedor without a place to live,'' Dashkov said.   Two government periodicals squabbled last month over whether theUnited States or the Soviet Union has a worse crime problem.Interior Ministry Lt. Col. V. Prokopenko said statistics showed thedubious honor still belongs to the Americans.   There are only 5.9 murders per 100,000 Soviets, compared to 8.9per 100,000 in America, Prokopenko told the official weeklyArguments and Facts. He said there were 91,000 rapes in the UnitedStates last year, or more than five times the 17,600 rapes reportedin the more populous Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
