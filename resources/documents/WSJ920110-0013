Then take over a travel agency. Add some realestate in southern China. Finally, throw in a malting plant,also in southern China.   To some people, this may seem a game of Monopoly run amok.To others, it may sound plain confusing. But it's all seriousbusiness to the authorities of Guangdong, the Chinese coastalprovince adjacent to Hong Kong. Loyal Communist Partyofficials are enthusiastically playing the capitalist game.And no business seems too exotic in their acquisition binge,conducted through Guangdong Investment Ltd., a company listedon the stock exchange of Hong Kong.</LP><TEXT>   As Hong Kong prepares to return to Chinese rule in 1997,the economies of southern China and the colony are becomingmore tightly interlaced, enriching many mainland companies onthe receiving end of foreign investment. Many of thesecompanies are now eager to invest their profits overseas,much of it in Hong Kong. Citic Pacific Ltd., which iscontrolled by Beijing-based China International Trust andamp;Investment Corp., is the most prominent example of aChinese-related company that is cleaning up in the capitalistgame.   Few mainland companies enjoy the financial and politicalclout of Citic Pacific, whose parent is a division of China'scentral government. Yet at the provincial level, GuangdongInvestment may eventually rank as high. As the primaryinvestment arm of the Guangdong authorities, the company hasbehind it all the resources of China's wealthiest economicregion. It's one of the few China-controlled companies basedin Hong Kong with a listing on the colony's stock exchange,thanks largely to the track record of its parent company,Guangdong Enterprises Ltd., the province's primary agent inthe colony since 1981. Some people are already callingGuangdong Investment the &quot;Son of Citic.&quot;   &quot;It has the potential to be the most genuine China play inHong Kong and one of China's biggest conglomerates over thenext few years,&quot; says Allan Ng, an analyst with S.G. Warburg(Far East) Ltd.   Many investors seem to agree. The company's shares closedThursday at 1.46 Hong Kong dollars (about 19 U.S. cents), upone Hong Kong cent from Wednesday and up 143% fromyear-earlier levels.   &quot;It's a concept stock,&quot; says Steven So, an analyst withJardine Fleming Broking Ltd. &quot;You buy it on the idea that theGuangdong government will put their assets in it. Some ofthose assets will be attractive, and some of them won't.&quot;   Not everyone is convinced, however. The company seems tolack a clear investment strategy when acquiring assets, andmany outsiders worry that it will squander its potential. Thecompany's immediate prospects are also clouded by Sino-U.S.trade friction, which could bludgeon southern China if atrade war ensues.   Guangdong Investment, established in 1988 throughGuangdong Enterprises' purchase of a Hong Kong-listed shellcompany, is apparently unmoved by such concerns. Until earlythis year, its portfolio consisted primarily of a hotel, anoffice building and a waste-management company. A plan toshift some of the parent's holdings into Guangdong Investmentwas pre-empted by China's bloody crackdown on pro-democraticdissent in 1989.   Now, Guangdong Investment is snapping up assets fasterthan securities regulators can keep pace. Earlier this month,the company announced a HK$552 million issue of new shares topay for three investments -- the travel agency and theproperty development and malting factory in southern China.The issue doubled the company's capital base, to 820 millionshares.   Guangdong Investment submitted a document explaining thenature of the assets, in compliance with exchange rules. Butso significantly will the purchases alter GuangdongInvestment's core business and profitability -- analysts nowexpect the company's 1992 earnings will be HK$95 million,seven times the projected 1991 level -- that the stockexchange asked the company to issue a new prospectus. &quot;Theassets they are acquiring are quite substantial,&quot; says amember of the exchange's listing committee. &quot;But we don'tknow anything about them.&quot;   Despite its rapid, somewhat piecemeal, expansion, manypeople agree that the company has tapped into some lucrativebusinesses. Consider, for example, the New Cathay Hotel,which the company acquired in 1988. At a time when HongKong's hotel industry is still smarting from a slowdown invisitor arrivals, the New Cathay is 95% full, mostly withguests from southern China.   The hotel reopened in 1989 after a HK$50 millionrenovation, which recast the dour lobby with polished granitefloors, art-deco light fixtures and furniture of imitationblack marble. In one corner stands a Yamaha player-piano witha hard disk for expanded memory. The rooms were also redone,but for economic, rather than aesthetic, reasons; they werepartitioned to double the hotel's capacity to 228 units.Rates range from HK$550 for a single room to HK$1,300 for adeluxe suite.   Most of the guests arrive on buses owned by GuangdongTours (H.K.) Ltd., which Guangdong Investment acquired forHK$317 million. The company, which packages Hong Kong toursfor Guangdong residents, owns the franchise for six of theeight government-approved tours that are allowed into HongKong each day.   Guangdong Investment's other prime asset is its 80%-ownedproperty development in Panyu, about 10.5 miles fromGuangzhou, Guangdong's capital. The first phase of thecommercial-residential project, to be completed within threeto five years, was purchased in June for HK$30 million. Theslightly larger second phase, bought this month for HK$66million, is expected to be finished in 1997.   The complex, which will cover 6.4 million square feet, isexpected to raise about HK$400 million in profit between nowand the late 1990s, according to independent forecasts.</TEXT></DOC>
