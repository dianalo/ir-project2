Trust To Get $518.8 Million For Land U.S. Took </HL><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> REL </IN><DATELINE> MENLO PARK, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The trust charged with liquidating certain holdings of Arcata Corp. said it will receive $518.8 million in compensation for redwood timberlands taken by the government to expand a national park.    The trust said the figure includes principal and interest on its claim dating back to 1978, when the U.S. condemned about 10,000 acres of Arcata's timberlands to expand Redwood National Park.    When Arcata went private in 1982 through a leveraged buy-out, it agreed to split proceeds of the litigation with former shareholders on a 50/50 basis. Those holders now are expected to receive an initial payout of about $27.50, with a subsequent final payment of about $1. The other half will go to San Francisco-based Arcata, now a closely held printing concern.    The settlement isn't the first windfall to emerge from the Redwood National Park expansion. As previously reported, Portland, Ore-based Louisiana-Pacific Corp. recently settled with the government on its claim, under which it received a total of $665 million in principal and interest for 25,600 acres of redwood timberland.    In Louisiana-Pacific's case, $225 million of the total figure had been received earlier from the government.    The Arcata trust said the settlement figure doesn't include $97,000 a day it will receive as interest until the government pays the settlement, expected within 60 days. </TEXT></DOC>
