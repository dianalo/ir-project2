It was the first time that a scientist had so publicly and positivelylinked recent weather patterns with the global climate changes predictedto occur in response to increasing carbon dioxide and other greenhousegases in the atmosphere. Other scientists have remained cautious, maintainingthat higher temperatures over the past few years can be explained bynatural climate fluctuations. Nevertheless, scientists and many policymakers are calling for action on the greenhouse effect.</TEXT></DOC>
