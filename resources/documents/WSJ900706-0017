Like Mr. Lynch before him, Mr. Smith is in almostperpetual motion, visiting companies, grilling analysts andbuying stocks by the fistful. His biggest bet now: nonbankfinancial stocks.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Smith took over as manager of the country's largestmutual fund on June 1. That was also the day his wife wentinto labor. But Mr. Smith stuck it out at the office, workinga full day. &quot;It was the fourth time around, so you get usedto it,&quot; said Mr. Smith, a 32-year-old graduate of theUniversity of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. &quot;If I'd had tocome home, she would have called me.&quot;   On that occasion, Mr. Smith bet right. His wife didn'tgive birth until the following day. But the real question forMagellan's one million shareholders is, can Mr. Smith deliverin the stock market?   Fidelity Magellan is the country's largest fund, with thebest 10-year record. Mr. Smith, who until recently managedthe Fidelity OTC fund, has been at the Magellan helm for onlya month. Early returns show Magellan up 0.44% for June, vs.0.16% for the average stock fund.   &quot;The most obvious change is that there are a lot fewernames in the fund,&quot; said Mr. Smith. He has trimmed backMagellan's holdings from 1,300 stocks when Mr. Lynchannounced his resignation at the end of March to 775 today.&quot;That appears to be a lot more significant than it is.Peter's secret was not owning a lot of names. It was makingbig bets on a few stocks.&quot;   Mr. Smith is continuing this tradition. The fund's 50largest holdings account for 38% of the fund's assets, andthe top 100 holdings amount to 52%.   Mr. Smith's biggest current position is in nonbankfinancial stocks, an area Mr. Lynch also was fond of. Mr.Smith has retained, and in some cases added to, Magellan'slarge positions in the Federal National Mortgage Association,Student Loan Marketing Association, Federal Home LoanMortgage Corp. and financial services companies such asKemper Corp. and Primerica Corp.   &quot;Most of these stocks have very attractive fundamentals.They have visible earnings, and they are at attractiveprice/earnings ratios,&quot; said Mr. Smith. &quot;They're beingtainted with the same brush as the bank stocks.&quot;   Mr. Smith, for instance, thinks the earnings at Fannie Maeand Freddie Mac, two entities that buy home loans andrepackage them as securities, will grow 12% to 15% annuallyover the next few years. &quot;I don't see many stocks with thatoutlook which are trading at roughly eight times next year'searnings,&quot; he said.   Mr. Smith is also enamored of Kemper, the insurance andmoney management firm. He reckons Kemper, which closedyesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at$41.25, up 25 cents, will earn between $5.50 and $6 a sharenext year.   When Mr. Lynch announced his resignation, Magellan hadhefty positions in Nestle S.A., Philip Morris Cos. andUnilever PLC. Mr. Smith said he still owns the stocks, but hehas also built up big positions in his favorites such asPepsiCo Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., both of which rankamong the fund's 10 largest holdings.   &quot;There's probably more of a weighting in technology thanthere was before,&quot; said Mr. Smith, who has bought largepositions in companies including Compaq Computer Corp. andConner Peripherals Inc. &quot;That's probably something I broughtwith me from the OTC fund.&quot; Mr. Smith has also added tostakes in some of his favorite over-the-counter companies,such as the athletic-shoe maker Nike Inc. and thelong-distance telephone carrier MCI Communications Corp.   With Mr. Lynch gone, the mutual fund manager with the best10-year record is G. Kenneth Heebner, who has managed CGMCapital Development and New England Growth since 1977. Forthe past decade, the two funds rank as the third and fifthbest performers, respectively.                                                                                                          Five-Year Leader                                                                                                          Japan Fund                                   +288.67%                                                                                                          Life has been a roller coaster lately for the Japan Fund,a no-load mutual fund managed by New York's Scudder, Stevensandamp; Clark.   In this year's first quarter the $365 million fund waspummeled for a 16.1% loss, as the Tokyo stock market tanked.But in the most recent three months, the fund bounced back16.27%, making it one of the second quarter's top performingfunds.   &quot;The {Japanese} market for small companies went up in thefirst quarter, while the rest of the market was down,&quot; notedthe fund's 62-year-old manager, O. Robert Theurkauf. He saidthe Japan Fund's performance was helped because small andmedium-sized companies account for more than 30% of its stockportfolio: &quot;That's the single most important factor thatexplains this year's good performance.&quot;   Rough times are nothing new to the Japan Fund. It used tobe a closed-end, or publicly traded, fund. But it came underattack by corporate raiders and in 1987 converted to aregular open-end mutual fund, issuing and redeeming shares tomeet investor demand. The fund also had a recent managerchange in February, when Mr. Theurkauf, who has worked atScudder for 40 years, took over leadership of the fund.   But through it all, the fund has produced stellar results.It ranks as the top fund over five years and the fourth bestfor the past decade.   Mr. Theurkauf isn't ready to make startling predictionsabout the Tokyo stock market, but he does sound a note ofcaution about the Japanese economy. &quot;We think the underlyinginflation is very real, and this is manifesting itself inhigher interest rates,&quot; he said. &quot;If you talk to brokers,they'll say the market is going back to 40000. We doubt it.&quot;Japan's Nikkei index of 225 stocks closed Thursday at32351.67 points.   For now, Mr. Theurkauf is placing his bets on largenoncyclical companies including such retailers as AutobacsSeven Co., Aoyama Trading Co. and Ito-Yokado Co. He is alsohanging on to seemingly undervalued smaller companies such asAsatsu Inc., an advertising agency, and Ines Corp., MKC Ltd.and Nippon System Development Co., all of which producecomputer software.                                                                                                          12-Month Leader                                                                                                          Fidelity Select Biotechnology                + 56.36%                                                                                                          For managers of Fidelity's 38 Select portfolios, whicheach invest in a single industry, it sure helps to be in theright place at the right time.   Nobody knows that better than Michael Gordon, the25-year-old manager of the $160 million Fidelity SelectBiotechnology. Propelled by a run-up in biotechnology stocksthat started in early 1989, the fund has the best 12-monthrecord of all mutual funds, with a total return of 56.36%.   Mr. Gordon, who graduated three years ago from TuftsUniversity with a double major in classics and quantitativeeconomics, said biotech stocks have been boosted by a seriesof successful product launches and by the proposed merger ofGenentech Inc. with Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche HoldingLtd. Genentech, which closed on the Big Board at $29, up 50cents, is Mr. Gordon's largest position.   Under the $2.1 billion merger pact, which got the nod fromGenentech's shareholders in June but still needs approvalfrom the Federal Trade Commission, Roche Holding will buy 60%of Genentech's stock. For every two Genentech shares, holderswill get $36 in cash plus one share of redeemable Genentechcommon stock. Roche has the right to buy all of theredeemable stock at various dates between December 1990 andJune 1995. The redemption price ranges from $38 a share forthe earliest redemption date to $60 if Roche waits until June1995. &quot;It's most attractive {for shareholders} if theredeemable stock is redeemed this December,&quot; said Mr. Gordon,based on the imputed rate of return of the various redemptionprices.   The fund's second largest position is Amgen Inc., whichlast year successfully introduced Epogen, a drug thatstimulates red blood cell production and can be used to treatdialysis patients suffering from anemia. Mr. Gordon has hiseye on the company's next big product launch.   &quot;The company has a second product, called G-CSF, whichboosts bone marrow and thereby fights infections,&quot; said Mr.Gordon, who expects the drug to be able to help cancerpatients undergoing chemotherapy. He expects the product'sintroduction to be approved in Europe and the U.S. within ayear. &quot;Earnings should continue to grow at 35% to 50%{annually} for a few years once this thing is launched.&quot;   The fund has 70% of its assets in biotechnology researchcompanies such as Amgen and Genentech. But Mr. Gordon alsoinvests in some companies that supply the big researchoutfits. The fund owns such stocks as Applied BiosystemsInc., which makes machines for analyzing DNA, and LifeTechnologies Inc., which supplies reagents to biotechcompanies.                                                                                                          Second-Quarter Leader                                                                                                          Schield Progressive Environmental            + 29.54%                                                                                                          &quot;Ours is a fund you will truly feel good about,&quot; proclaimsthe 100% recycled paper marketing brochure for the SchieldProgressive Environmental Fund.   Schield's shareholders would no doubt agree. For the mostrecent quarter, the fund ranks as the top performing mutualfund, with a total return of 29.54%.   &quot;Twenty-five years ago, the environmental business wasgarbage collection,&quot; said Glenn Cutler, the fund's36-year-old manager. &quot;Today, the environmental business as weknow it is in its infancy. We've littered the earth with theresidue of progress.&quot;   The Schield fund, which was launched in February and hasassets of just $1.6 million, is hardly your typical mutualfund. According to its prospectus, the fund invests in&quot;companies engaged in contributing to a cleaner and healthierenvironment.&quot; But the fund's stock picks are also vetted tomake sure the companies are &quot;socially responsible.&quot; And lestinvestors have any further doubts about the fund's goodintentions, the fund's distributor also donates part of itsannual fee to charity.   This fund isn't for the faint of heart. SchieldProgressive Environmental is a so-called nondiversified fund,which means it can invest its assets in a relatively smallnumber of stocks. The fund currently owns just 14 stocks,mostly smaller companies traded over-the-counter or on theAmerican Stock Exchange. Three stocks account for almost 34%of the fund's assets, and some of the fund's holdings tradeat well over 20 times earnings.   &quot;You can't buy environmental stocks based on{price/earnings} multiples,&quot; said Mr. Cutler. &quot;You've got topick them up based on the niche they're in, the quality ofthe management and their growth rate.&quot;   The fund's largest position, at 16% of assets, is SanifillInc., an operator of landfills in Georgia and Texas. &quot;It's agreat cash generating business with prices moving in theright direction,&quot; said Mr. Cutler, who reckons the companywill earn 50 cents to 60 cents a share this year. Sanifillclosed in American Stock Exchange composite trading at$21.25, up 50 cents.   Mr. Cutler also has a big stake in Martech USA Inc., whichis in the marine pollution control business. Martech played arole in the Exxon Valdez oil cleanup. &quot;Nobody wants to seelarge oil spills, but there are spills every day,&quot; said Mr.Cutler. &quot;Most of them don't get reported in the news.&quot; Heexpects Martech, which fell 25 cents in nationalover-the-counter trading to $13.25, will earn 95 cents ashare for the year ending in August.   Schield Progressive Environmental charges a 4.5% salescommission on investments. The fund also has projected annualexpenses of 2.5%, well above the 1.5% average for stockmutual funds.   ---         How the Biggest Mutual Funds Have Performed                                                                                                          Percentage gains for periods ended June 30; assets as ofMarch 31                                                                                                                         ASSETS     SECOND  TWELVE  FIVE     TEN   FUND NAME  (in billions) QUARTER  MONTHS  YEARS   YEARS                                                                                                          Fidelity Magellan Fund                 $13.2        6.6%   17.0%   152.7%  966.4%                                                                                                          Franklin Cust:US Govt                  11.2        3.3     8.7     59.0   166.9                                                                                                          Dean Witter US Govt                  10.0        2.8     7.6     46.5    N.A.
