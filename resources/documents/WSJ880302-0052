Pete McCloskey to arbitration, but Mr. McCloskey still insists on a trial.    Mr. Robertson sued Mr. McCloskey alleging that the former congressman from California had libeled him by claiming that Mr. Robertson had used the influence of his father, a U.S. senator, to avoid combat duty in Korea 37 years ago.    But in recent weeks, Mr. Robertson has been weighing options to avoid the libel trial, which is scheduled to begin in federal court here March 8. On that day, dubbed Super Tuesday, 20 states hold contests that figure prominently in the selection of presidential nominees.    Yesterday, Mr. Robertson said he would drop the suit and place the dispute before an arbitration group in Iowa. But Mr. McCloskey said he will resist the move and continued to insist that his legal fees be paid if the suit is dropped. He estimated them at $400,000, which he said is more than his net worth.
