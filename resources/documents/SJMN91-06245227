But Gov. PeteWilson's effort to hold up passage of the budget to force certain cost-savingrevisions in the system ended in disappointment.;   The state Legislature isunlikely to take up the issue again this year. And businesses and workers areleft to grapple with the unwieldy and expensive system.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  A DISABLED SYSTEMTHE COSTS OF INEFFICIENCY CRIPPLE CALIFORNIA'SWORKER'S COMPENSATION PROGRAM --EMPLOYERS SAY IT COSTS TOO MUCH; WORKERS SAY THEYGET TOO LITTLE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See also related article on page 1E of this section.

At the same time, it ranks among the worstnationally in benefits paid to injured workers.;   Workers complain thatdelays in the court system and stalling by insurance companies result in yearsof waiting before some cases are settled and benefits are paid. Employers saythe cost of the system, originally designed as a safety net for injuredworkers, has gone out of control.;   Here are some of the key complaints fromboth sides:;   (check) Spiraling cost increases in health care have madetreating injured workers more expensive, and the administrative costs andpremiums that employers pay keep growing.;   (check) A 700 percent increase inmental stress claims during the last decade, partly because of fraud, israising costs for businesses. A new law sponsored by Sen. Robert Presley,D-Riverside, creates stiffer penalties for &quot;stress mills&quot; that manufacturefalse claims. But more needs to be done, critics say.;   (check) Quickresolution of claims has been made almost impossible because of rampant&quot;doctor shopping&quot; for paid experts who present the opinion desirable toworkers or employers.;   (check) The insurance industry charges employers 32percent in overhead costs under a law originally designed to protect theCalifornia insurance industry in its infancy. Critics say that protectionamounts to socialism for the insurance industry -- at employers' expense. Theyalso criticize a system that sets mandatory minimum rates for employers,saying it eliminates fair competition.;   Although many of these issues wereaired in the state budget debate, little action resulted. And when the variousfactions take up the worker's compensation issue next year, no one expects aquick or easy resolution. Many of the middlemen between employers and workerswill be pressing for their special interests. At the same time, employers andworkers have compelling, and sometimes competing, arguments for their causes.Both sides admit this will make cleaning up the system a Herculean task.; Thesafety net?; California's $10 billion worker's compensation system is thelargest in the United States, covering more than 12 million workers who areinjured on the job.; (box)In California's privately run system, more than 300insurance companies compete for worker's compensation business. Some largeemployers are self-insured, and many smaller companies are covered by astate-run fund.; (box)California's worker's compensation insurance costs arenearly 60 percent above the national average. Yet until 1989, its weeklybenefits to injured workers ranked 47th in the nation.; (box)After a reformthat year, its ranking increased to 30th place among the states. Maximumtemporary disability benefits were raised from $224 a week to $336 a week. Butcritics from business and organized labor say workers' benefits are still toolow.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Stories by Michelle Levander Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910901  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  572  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, September 1, 199100245227,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
