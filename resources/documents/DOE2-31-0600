The phantom consisted of stackedpolyethylene sheets, aluminum and silicon films, and thin aluminum circuitsetched onto the top of the silicon wafer. An aluminum step wedge wasplaced over the phantom. An x-ray image of the sample was cast onto atelevision camera, digitized, and sent to a PDP computer, where the 128-frameaverage of the phantom image was subtracted from the 128-frame averageof the phantom-and-step image. The resulting image was then transferredto a video monitor. Two-micrometer tungsten wires were also imaged. Thesystem and its performance and sensitivity are described and illustrated.</TEXT></DOC>
