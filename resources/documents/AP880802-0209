However, others, including the chairman of the Senate BankingCommittee, William Proxmire, D-Wis., said the problem has grown solarge that healthy Sandamp;Ls can't alone assume the burden of restoringthe rest of the business to solvency.   ``We are in a big, black bottomless pit,'' said Herbert M.Sandler, chairman of World Savings and Loan Association in Oakland,Calif.   ``It looks like there is virtually no way we can avoid some sortof hit on the Treasury,'' Proxmire said.   Gould, the No. 3 official at Treasury and the administration'schief policymaker on banking and financial issues, urged senatorsnot to be spooked into hasty and drastic action by exaggeratedestimates of the problem facing the savings industry, where 500 of3,100 institutions are considered insolvent.   Some private analysts have said it will take as much as $100billion to restore the industry to health, but Gould dismissedthose estimates as out of line. He suggested that $30 billion, theestimate of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and Congress' GeneralAccounting Office, ``is not a bad number.''   However, Gould conceded that $50 billion was not out of thequestion, particularly if the oil-dependent economy in Texas, wheremany of the insolvent Sandamp;Ls are located, doesn't begin recovering.   Whatever the size of the problem, Congress should turn totaxpayer money only after ``we ... exhaust all other availableresources,'' he said.   He suggested that, first, Congress could expand theindustry-financed recapitalization of the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp., which began last summer.   Savings institutions are charged an extra assessment to pay off$10.8 billion in borrowing for FSLIC over three years. Theadministration originally urged that the industry be tapped for $15billion.   Gould was backed by Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the rankingRepublican on the committee, who said, ``I'm not going to ask thetaxpayers of this country to bail out fraud, mismanagement andabuse of managerial powers'' by Sandamp;Ls.   Pressed by senators to recommend action for Congress this year,Gould advised only that they pass legislation forming a blue ribboncommission to study the problem and report back next spring.   The Senate Banking Committee endorsed such legislation last weekand a House Banking oversight subcommittee on Tuesday urged itspassage. However, the full House Banking Committee already voted32-19 last week against attaching it to an unrelated banking bill.   The committee chairman, Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I.,complained that the commission as proposed by Rep. Stan Parris,R-Va., would be too heavily weighted with appointees of PresidentReagan, a lame duck.   Proxmire said he would propose bills to restrict insolvent Sandamp;Lsfrom growing, a tactic critics maintain only compounds theirproblems. He also advocated restricting the ability of federallyinsured thrift institutions to expand into real estate and otherrisky investment areas permitted by some states.   The top federal Sandamp;L regulator, Federal Home Loan Bank BoardChairman M. Danny Wall, said his agency already limits the growthof insolvent Sandamp;Ls and was stepping up enforcement of the rule.   In an interview with several reporters after the hearing, hesaid he was not opposed to a move by Congress to give the Sandamp;Linsurance fund more money by expanding the existingindustry-supported borrowing program.</TEXT></DOC>
