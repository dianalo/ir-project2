This is afirst meeting _ a time for exploration. It is not a time fordetailed arms control negotiations best left for next year's summit.   I want President Gorbachev to know exactly where the UnitedStates stands. Let me be clear _ America stands with freedom anddemocracy. We are not meeting to determine the future of Europe _after all, the peoples of Europe are determining their own future.   Though there will be no surprises sprung on our allies, we willmiss no opportunity to expand freedom and enhance the peace.   And to those who question our prudent pace, they must understandthat a time of historic change is no time for recklessness. Thepeace, and the confidence, and the security of our friends inEurope _ it's just too important.   We will seek President Gorbachev's assurance that this processof reform in Eastern Europe will continue. And we will give him ourassurance that America welcomes reform not as an adversary seekingadvantage, but as a people offering support.   Our goal is to see this historic tide of freedom broadened,deepened _ and sustained.   We find enormous encouragement in its peaceful advance and itsacceptance by the Soviet Union. We can now raise our hopes on otherissues _ our common environment, our common war against drugs, aswell as on human rights, and the regional conflicts that remain.   Immediately after my visit with President Gorbachev, I will goto Brussels to consult with our partners in NATO _ the veryalliance that has kept the West free for 40 years. I will assurethem that no matter how dramatic the change in Eastern Europe, orin the Soviet Union itself, the United States will continue tostand with our allies and our friends.   For in a new Europe, the American role may change in form butnot in fundamentals. After all, the Soviet Union maintains hundredsof thousands of troops throughout Eastern Europe.   Study the map, review history and you'll see that this presence,with the Soviet Union's natural advantage of geography, cannot beignored.   So even if forces are significantly reduced on both sides, anoble goal indeed, we will remain in Europe as long as our friendswant and need us.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
