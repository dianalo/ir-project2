ATandamp;T spokesman Walter G. Murphy said the company has beenplanning next year's reductions for some time and already hasnotified employees.   ``The people in the departments that are affected by the jobreductions planned for 1990 have been informed,'' he said.   The Wall Street Journal reported on the cuts in today's editionsand quoted unidentified sources as saying that they could be partof a wider work force reduction campaign in 1990.   Murphy declined to characterize the reductions or to comment onhow sweeping they would be.   Most of the 1990 reductions will occur in ATandamp;T's NetworkServices division, which has 37,600 workers and runs ATandamp;T'slong-distance network, Murphy said. Employees were told on Nov. 28of plans to reduce the division staff by 6,000 jobs.   Additionally, the company plans to cut 700 jobs in its BusinessCommunications Systems unit, 1,400 jobs in its Material Managementandamp; Service unit, and 400 jobs in its General Business Systemsdivision in 1990.   The Business Communications Systems unit, which supplies officephone services to big businesses, has 15,000 workers while theGeneral Business Systems division, which handles phone service forsmaller companies, has 11,200 workers. Material Management andamp;Services has 8,700 workers.   Murphy said advances in technology have been behind much of thejob cutting at ATandamp;T. The company envisioned thousands of cuts as itupgrades its long-distance phone network to a more efficientdigital system by the end of next year, for instance.   The big communications company has intensified its efforts tosteamline operations lately by automating factories and back-officefacilities and by breaking itself down into smaller, more focusedunits.   ATandamp;T has almost frozen hiring and instead has redeployedexisting staff into vacant positions.   ``We're on a drive to right-size this place to be competitive,''Harold W. Burlingame, vice president of human resources at ATandamp;T,told the Journal. ``Our managers are quickly learning that theymust focus on costs, customers and competitors.''   Most of this year's cuts have come through early retirement orattrition, but several thousand have come through unannounced cuts.   Since 1984 when the company divested its regional operatingcompanies, ATandamp;T has cut about 90,000 jobs. The company will have apayroll of about 280,000 employees by January.</TEXT></DOC>
