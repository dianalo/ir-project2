DeltaInfomatica SCRL, Trento, Italy; Quatemaire Informatique, Boulogne, France;and MBS GmbH, Dusseldorf, West Germany - in its new guise Blazer is claimedto be twice as fast as its predecessor.andM;-  o  -andM;Schlumberger CAD/CAM has placed a $10.5m order with DEC for itsandM;VAXstation 3100 and 3520 symmetric multi-processing workstations, and it willmarket the machines with Bravo 3 CAD/CAM software: Bravo 3 has applicationsfor finite element modelling and analysis, numerical control machining,facilities design, bills of material, schematic capture, manufacturing andtesting outputs, and data management tools; of the 555 workstations, 330 werebought outside the US, and Schlumberger UK currently has 35 orders for thesystems; the company has bought a total of 850 VAXstations 3100 workstationsso far this year.andM;-  o  -andM;Sanderson Computers Ltd of Sheffield, West Yorkshire hasandM;incorporated MRP II manufacturing modules in its PICS financial andproduction package: it was designed with accountants Price Waterhouse, andhas several modules including capacity planning, material requirements,production scheduling, and rough cut planning; the software runs onSanderson's Pick family, which can support up to 500 users.andM;-  o  -andM;Mission Electronics' UK division, based in Huntingdon,andM;Cambridgeshire, has developed a low-cost method for linking small Unix andXenix systems into standard Novell Inc NetWare networks supporting non-Unixsystems as well any other TCP/IP based network: using a 25MHz 80386-basedMission workstation with Network File System and dedicated cards, the link issome #340 per workstation, against #5,000 or so otherwise required for suchinterconnections; the new method was developed with Hardwick,Cambridgeshire-based TCP/IP specialist Unipalm Ltd and making the connectionis claimed to take only 10 minutes.andM;-  o  -andM;Santa Clara, California-based Integrated Device Technology Inc'sandM;RISC CPU module is now available in the UK from Microlog Ltd, Woking, Surrey:the IDT7RS101 card uses an R3000 chip set from MIPS Computer Systems -available with or without the R3010 floating point accelerator - running at12MHz for 9 MIPS, 16MHz for 12 MIPS, 20MHz for 16 MIPS and 25MHz for 20 MIPSof performance respectively; board prices start at $2,900 and rise to $3,640.andM;-  o  -andM;Cambridge-based Torus Systems Ltd has enhanced its Tapestry IIandM;networking software to support OS/2 on both the file server and workstation:Tapestry II Version 2.0 will enable all the server tasks to be installed onone OS/2 machine, and workstations can run under either MS-DOS or OS/2; thesoftware will be available in October, and Torus will publish prices at thattime.andM;-  o  -andM;A software conversion centre has been set up by Dataflex ServicesandM;Ltd, London, for software developers wanting to move their MS-DOSapplications to the range of Unix environments: the company 1claims that onaverage a complete 'ready-to-run' implementation can be done in four hours,and 17 different Unix implementations are supported.andM;-  o  -andM;UK company Technology Concepts Ltd, Cwmbran, Gwent, is moving intoandM;the Unix market, announcing support for Xenix right across its range ofserial input-output products; in addition, the firm has a new multi-port cardsupporting eight asynchronous channels on both the AT and PS/2 formats,providing an option to buffer up to 16 characters in and out per channel andalso Xenix- compatible; prices start at #525.andM;-  o  -andM;ATandamp;T Co has begun shipping 3B2 600s to government agenciesandM;following the Air Force's award of the giant AFCAC 251 contract last October,potentially worth $4,500m over five years, but shipments will have toincrease if the value is to be anything like that - so far ATandamp;T has shippedonly 120 systems in July, and Computer Systems News estimates that it need toship  around 350 units a month; ATandamp;T says it was delayed by the appealagainst the award by Honeywell Inc.andM;-  o  -andM;The convoluted world of standards committees is hard to keepandM;abreast with, and so the US Usenix Association has got together with the European Unix User Group to employ a single representative, Dominic Dunlop ofThe Standard Answer, to attend all the meetings of the InternationalStandards Organisation Unix and C meetings and keep them informed: some ideaof how involved that work will be can be gained from the full title of theISO group working on the standards, in effect an IEEE Posix standard forEurope - it's Working Group 15 of Sub-Committee 22 of Technical Committee 1of the International Standards Organisation and the InternationalElectrotechnical Commission, known as ISO/IEC TCI SC22 WG15 for short (no,no, you've come to the wrong room - this is the ISO/IEC TCI SC23 WG15committee in here)andM;-  o  -andM;Full circle: Envos, Mountain View, California employee-ownedandM;spin-off from the ill-fated Xerox Artificial Intelligence Systems BusinessUnit which crashed in April, has now been reabsorbed by Xerox Corp.andM;-  o  -andM;HCR Corp, Toronto, Canada has a C++ compiler based on version 2.0andM;of ATandamp;T's language: HCR/C++ is available now and includes dbx, HCR's sourcelevel debugger; price is $500, or $100 for an upgrade from its compiler forC++ version 1.0.andM;-  o  -andM;A new report on the Unix market from Market Intelligence ResearchandM;Co, Mountain View, California, predicts worldwide sales of Unix software willreach $9,300m by 1995.andM;-  o  -andM;Wang Laboratories's UK division in Brentford, Middlesex, hasandM;followed its US operation and is now offering SCO Xenix on its 200 and 300Series personal computers: the 16-user PC 381 and PC 382 support Xenix 386,starting at #20,000; the eight-user PC 200 series will now run Xenix 286starting at #12,000.andM;-  o  -andM;Sounds like they wanted to keep it out of the local press: thereandM;was a story on Garden City, Long Island-based Computer AssociatesInternational Inc in the US edition of the Wall Street Journal last Thursday- at least it was in the edition circulating in New York City, but an editorat InformationWeek, out in Great Neck, Long Island had to call our USassociate Technology News of America to get the story read to her - it wasmissing from Long Island editions of the paper.andM;-  o  -andM;We floated the jolly theory that the IBM 3090S is Summit back inandM;June (CI No 1,208), pointing out that IBMers had actually said it was (&quot;whydo you suppose it's called S?&quot; was the quote), and that other IBMers had saidlast summer that there would be &quot;at least&quot; one more kicker for the 3090s, andit seems Gartner Group Inc was coming up with the same theory at the sametime: in its July notes, it sees a 3090 &quot;G&quot; around year-end, addingeverything Summity that was not included in the S, with the new successor tothe 3090s appearing in mid-1991, initially with three and six CPU models fordelivery in the second half of 1992; an interesting new factor that Gartnertosses into the pot is that as well as 16M-bit memory chips (so that usershave to ditch their existing memory), which should be ready around then, thenew machines will be built in the up-and-coming hybrid BiCMOS technology,which uses ECL or another bipolar technology for the most speed- criticalfunctions on the chip, and reduces overall power consumption by using CMOSfor the rest of each circuit; Gartner looks for 10,000 gate BiCMOS arrays andan 8nS processor cycle with the uniprocessor delivering 50 MIPS, and suggestsa second layer of clustering over multiprocessors, with up to 16 systemsvirtually coupled to create a single image system, with 3090s and the newmachines - Gartner harks back to the early 1970s for the name Future System -perhaps able to be mixed in these clusters; aandP; maximum eight processors in asystem is forecast.andM;-  o  -andM;IBM is also storing up trouble for the future by offeringandM;excessively large discounts on high-end 3090s, Gartner Gorup believes: itsuggests that IBM was giving hard cash discounts on 3090-600S machines of asmuch as 30% to 40% in the second quarter - more than competitors say isnecessary to win the business - and the discounts are sweetened further byconcessions on software fees, extended warranties, training allowances, andwonders how it can get pricing back on track later on.andM;-  o  -andM;The agreement being thrashed out under which Siemens AG will takeandM;Rolm Corp off IBM's hands is clearly very different from the one that wasannounced in the preliminary agreement at the end of last year, and Siemensnow says that the cash portion of the price will be &quot;clearly below onebillion marks&quot; - that means it will be not more than about $500m - but theprice will now be adjusted retroactively, however, according to theperformance of the IBM-Siemens joint venture to be set up to sell and serviceprivate telephone exchanges in the US; Siemens says that turning theloss-making Rolm business around is going to need &quot;a long consolidation&quot;.andM;-  o  -andM;Atari Corp blamed painfully thin second quarter profits (see pageandM;five) principally on exchange rate fluctuations and depressed sales of videogames sales in the US market.andM;-  o  -andM;Apple Computer Inc has doubled the main memory and ROM that comesandM;standard with the Apple IIGS so that the thing now has 1Mb and 256Kb of ROMstandard, enough to enable it to operate on an AppleTalk network system andhandle larger documents and cleverer applications without the need for addedmemory; the larger ROM adds some features of the new System Software 5.0; thepriceandM;-  o  -andM;Well well - the first 5,000 portable Macintoshes have been presoldandM;to Eastman Kodak Co, Boeing Co and KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock according toMacintosh News - but Apple, Kodak, Boeing and the accountants all denied thestory to Newsbytes.andM;-  o  -andM;Fujitsu Ltd does so much business with Siemens AG that it hasandM;developed what it claims is the world's first Japanese-to-German translationsystem: developed with the help of Aris Software- Entwicklung GmbH, thesystem is claimed to translate from Japanese into German at a speed of 6,000words an hour using a German dictionary with 50,000 entries and 12,000grammar rules.andM;-  o  -andM;Friday September 1 has a ring around it on Apricot Computers Plc'sandM;calendar: that's the day when the Birmingham company is due to unveil a newnew range of stand-alone personal computers to join its Qi series ofnetworked and file-server machines, and expected are a high-end Qi PC-I with25MHz 80386 processor, a Qi PC line of PS/2-compatibles using the 16MHz80386SX chip set; and an AT-bus Xen-S PC386 also using the 80386SX; a #1mpress advertising campaign for the new machines is planned for September.andM;-  o  -andM;ATandamp;T Co is tipped to become the tenth board member of theandM;Hewlett-Packard Co-led object-oriented Object Management Forum.andM;-  o  -andM;As part of its decentralising restructuring programme DEC UK hasandM;plans to invest #20m and create up to 500 more jobs in Warrington Runcorn:DEC is to build a new northern regional centre on a 12 acre site bought fromWarrington Runcorn Development Corp which, upon its completion in mid-1993,will house mainly sales and account management staff looking after strategicaccounts in the Northern region; as devotees of the Warrington Runcorn TVcommercials will be aware DEC already has a base there.andM;-  o  -andM;Advanced Technology Systems Inc of Vienna, Virginia is preparingandM;to launch a product called LCache/386 which is designed to provide80386-based machines under Unix with a large buffer so that users can pulldata off write-once optical disk drives at near magnetic disk speed.andM;-  o  -andM;The phrase &quot;insider dealing&quot; has taken on a whole new meaningandM;follow-ing the recent indictment of a US psychiatrist for 3exploiting therevelations of one of his patients to make money on Wall Street: it seemsthat Dr Willis' patient came to him to discuss her marital problems whichstemmed from her husband's knowledge of a future business deal to the effectthat if former American Express president Sanford Weill became chief ofBankAmerica, $1,000m would be invested in BankAmerica; using thisinformation, Willis bought shares in BankAmerica and sold them shortly afterthe proposal became offici-al; clearly this was not so much a case of loosetalk costing lives as of a loose psyche destroying ethics.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
