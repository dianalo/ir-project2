The Defense Ministry said the soldiers staged their rebellionbecause they were angered by the resumption of trials on humanrights violations of fellow officers.   The government reported one rebel killed. DyN, an independentnews agency, said several rebels also were wounded. No governmentcasualties were reported.   Vice President Victor Martinez said rebel leader Col. Mohamed AliSeineldin gave up Friday night.   ``Col. Seineldin has made himself absolutely responsible for theepisodes, and has subordinated himself'' to the army command,Martinez told reporters as he walked out of Government Housefollowing a meeting with the defense minister and army chief.   ``There was no type of negotiation,'' he said.   Martinez said rebels remained holed up at an infantry school onthe sprawling Campo de Mayo base outside the capital. He said thatSeineldin agreed to try to convince them to accept defeat afterloyalists fired a few mortar rounds near the school, fatallywounding one rebel. The mutineers fired automatic rifles at theloyalists.   At least four army tanks entered the base, according to thereports. Rebels who planted mines at the infantry school entrancesbegan removing them after Seineldin asked for a truce.   ``The insubordinate soldiers at the infantry school at the Campode Mayo now accept the orders of the army chief,'' Lt. Gen. JoseDante Caridi said in a ministry communique.   A spokesman for the rebels said Caridi and Seineldin ``agreed toa truce of two weeks'' during which ``no sanctions will be takenagainst anyone.'' The rebel did not give his name nor explain whathe meant by a truce.   One officer died during the exchange of gun and mortar firebetween the two sides, the official news agency Telam reported, andfive people were injured, including a 19-year-old woman who was shotin the neck and stomach as she walked near the base.   The soldiers seized the infantry school on Thursday.      ``This is not a coup against the government, but a fight torestore military honor to the army and review the trials that punishthe just and promote the guilty,'' Seineldin had told reportersinside the base.   Civilian trials of officers accused of human rights abuses duringthe 1976-83 junta-ruled military dictatorships are resuming.   Seineldin said he commanded 400 soldiers, and he apparently alsocommanded 53 coast guard men who deserted their base Thursday. Thecoast guard men drove onto the infantry school grounds Friday.   Loyal troops had surrounded the school but held up attacking inthe apparent hope of avoiding bloodshed.   It was the third such rebellion in less than two years and armycommanders nationwide affirmed their loyalty to the civiliangovernment.   President Raul Alfonsin had made no reference to the militaryrebellion in his address to the U.N. General Assembly in New York onFriday. On his way into U.N. headquarters, the president appearedunconcerned about the mutiny and commented in Spanish that histroops would ``suffocate'' the uprising.   He told the assembly that if developed nations want to encouragedemocracy in Latin America, they ought to provide debt relief so newdemocracies are not overthrown by tyrants.   ``Unsatisfied expectations generate desperation, which alwaysfavors the adventures of the authoritarians,'' Alfonsin said.   Alfonsin, whose election in 1983 ended military rule that beganwith a coup in 1976, flew to Washington on Thursday evening andconferred with President-elect George Bush at Bush's home. Alfonsinwill return home Saturday.   Army insurrections in Argentina had occurred in April 1987 andJanuary 1988.   Officers have grumbled for months at selections for promotionsand retirements, a military budget that has shrunk by half in recentyears, and pay that has not kept pace with 332 percent inflationsince Jan. 1.</TEXT></DOC>
