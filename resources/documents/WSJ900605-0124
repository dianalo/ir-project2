At labor officeseach day now, they slump on benches side by side,recuperating from their latest binges. Every few minutes, abureaucrat's door opens, and out weaves another addition toPoland's lengthening register of the unemployed.   &quot;The Communists destroyed my health,&quot; one says, unsteadilyeasing down the steps. He has a yellowing bruise below hisleft eye. &quot;I had to steal. I became a bandit. The Communistsdid it.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Before Solidarity took over and rewrote the rule book,Poles who didn't have bona fide jobs -- not only bums butillegal moneychangers and underground novelists -- had topretend they did. Unemployment was a capitalist sin. InJanuary, Solidarity's sinfully capitalist new governmentlegalized it and started to pay jobless benefits. So theparasites who used to pretend they had jobs showed up at thelabor offices pretending they didn't.   That was the first wave. Then, one by one, came those whodid have jobs but only pretended to work. Solidarity had alsorestored the boss's right to fire individuals -- with onemonth's notice, for almost any reason, and with just fivedays for the worker to protest. By mid-February, 107,000 ofthe freshly axed, among them tradesmen who couldn't holdtheir own, had limped into the labor offices to register asunemployed. By mid-April this was up to 318,000, and by theend of May 443,000. Now, two more waves are about to break.   When school lets out, 300,000 high-school graduates willwant jobs. Every one of last year's graduates went straightto work, as did every graduate of the past four decades. Thisyear, only half will.   Mass layoffs will come by summer, after three months'notice and the unions' futile foot-dragging. At least 200,000layoffs are in the pipeline already at 6,000 failingfactories, not to mention 38 people at the National Centerfor the Methodology of Political Studies and 500 at theEnterprise for Industrial Automation. As many as two millioncould be on the dole by year end.   Solidarity hasn't blinked. Brazenly, compared withgovernments in the West that try to paper over capitalism'susual ups and downs, this one advertises unemployment ascentral to its economic plan. A healthy percentage of peoplewithout jobs, it posits, will thin the bloated work force andcreate a new market, not just for goods but for labor. Awildcat strike suspended last week at Lech Walesa's urginghas only hardened its resolve. While the Soviet Union'seconomists still tremble when they think of the jolt thatunemployment could bring, Poland's extol it.   &quot;There is greater appreciation among people now of theirjobs, and product quality has already improved,&quot; FinanceMinister Leszek Balcerowicz boasts in his first-quarterreport. &quot;A certain marginal unemployment is a natural elementof any market economy.&quot; Adds his adviser, Jacek Rostowski:&quot;There has to be a feeling that jobs are no longerguaranteed.&quot;   In theory, the people understand. Since January, they haveseen the economy's output fall 25% as a Solidarity-maderecession closed over the country. Their buying power hascollapsed. But they have also watched the shops fill up withgoods and January's 80% inflation fade to below 5%. For allof communism's teachings, they accept as a fact thatunemployment, and the threat of it, can be a good thing.   That's the theory. Now for the experience.   &quot;They aren't too depressed yet,&quot; says Irena Jasinka,standing in the hallway of the special labor office forwhite-collar workers on the ground floor of a scruffy Warsawapartment block. She has been a clerk here 35 years.&quot;Benefits are new. A novelty. Once they get used to this,they'll start complaining.&quot;   A few yards down the hall, a group of first-timers gathersat a notice headed, &quot;What every unemployed person shouldknow.&quot; Some are young, some gray, all neatly dressed. Theyread quietly.   &quot;It shocks me to see them here,&quot; Mrs. Jasinka says. &quot;Weused to get a different sort -- capricious, looking forsomething better, demanding everything. We spoiled them. Now,they'll take anything so someone else won't snatch it away.&quot;   The walls of the main room are hung with glass cases, joboffers on index cards tacked inside: &quot;Accountant withknowledge of foreign trade. English and German required.&quot;&quot;Telex operator. Must speak German.&quot; &quot;Engineer. Goodknowledge of English, foreign experience; knowledge ofIBM-AT.&quot;   Slim pickings. In Polish, &quot;white-collar worker&quot; translatesas &quot;a person who works with his mind,&quot; but the Poles knowthem better as &quot;professional tea drinkers.&quot; They are thefirst to go, and nobody wants them back. Last October,500,000 jobs went begging in Poland. Now, 29,000 are onoffer, and just 4,000 for tea drinkers, including people whocan speak Gaelic and run supercomputers. As they scan theindex cards, depression sets in.   &quot;I was fired,&quot; says Robert Borzecki, turning away from thecards. A stringy man of 25 in a jacket of many zippers, heworked until April in the map department of Poland'sgeological survey. &quot;Too many people were employed. There wasnothing I could do about it.&quot;   His wife, Ewa, stands beside him. She is 24, wears a jeanssuit and has painted her fingernails green. She made up themenus at the Central Planning Office canteen until she, too,was fired.   &quot;We don't want to go back to the old way, where you got ajob no matter what,&quot; she says.   &quot;We should have unemployment,&quot; says Mr. Borzecki, puttingan arm around her. &quot;It's something new, something that proveditself in the West. But here a man is still a name on apayroll and nothing else. The old are corrupted. They justwant to survive. Young people who could change things are theones who get fired.   &quot;They're afraid a young person with initiative will forcethem out. We won't find anything. The woman in there told me.For people like us, there are no offers.&quot;   Poland has set aside $280 million to pay unemploymentbenefits this year. (The Borzeckis will get perhaps $50 amonth; today, $20 a month will buy their black bread.) Laboroffices have doubled their staff of 2,000 and put in a newmind-set. Teresa Popiel, who as the Warsaw region's chiefused to &quot;follow and persecute parasites who were avoidingwork,&quot; went to Brussels for three weeks of re-education.   &quot;I saw an office there that employs 300 people and had 11computer specialists,&quot; she says. &quot;I almost had a heart attackwhen I saw the building. They had this organized for yearsand years, and we only started on Jan. 2.&quot;   Now, her officers spend their days phoning company aftercompany in search of job openings. One branch never knowswhat the next comes up with. They have no computers. If theydid, the phone lines wouldn't be good enough to pass on thedetails anyway. It's hardly a labor market. Then again, itwouldn't be even with computers. State-owned companies arelaying people off. They won't be hiring soon.   Solidarity is no fan of those commercial wrecks anyhow. Itlays its bets for new jobs on the same force it relies on tosalvage the country: private enterprise. So far this year,110,000 small shops have shut, temporarily or for good, yetmany others hung on and 65,000 new ones opened. With easyloans and Western aid, Solidarity hopes to steer its joblesstoward them. Whether they seize the opportunity will depend,it seems, on how much nerve is left in them after years ofcommunism.   Among the index cards at the labor office, someone hastaped up a notice, typed on the multicolored stationery of aprivate firm called Meritum: &quot;We employ tradesmen of allkinds. Please come see us.&quot; Jerzy Wasilewski, electricalengineer, reads it and lights up.   He worked for the state until he hit 40 two years ago,then left to try his luck as a private electrician. He didall right until the recession finished him in February.   &quot;I've been here six times,&quot; he says, jotting downMeritum's address. &quot;I'll have to find a job myself. Now,here's some company looking for tradesmen. I've got my car.I'll get right over there.&quot;   He finds Meritum's offices at the end of a long corridorin a fourth-rate hotel. It is a seat-of-the-pantsconglomerate: house building, cranberries, steel, computers,copy shops. Two men sit at facing desks in a room with a pileof Vietnamese basketry in one corner. Mr. Wasilewski pulls upa chair for his interview.   &quot;I used to be an electrician,&quot; he tells them. &quot;Now, notmuch is going on. The labor office has nothing for me.&quot;   &quot;Everywhere it sounds bad,&quot; one of the men says. &quot;Hereanyone can come and work.&quot; Meritum, he explains, will locatesupplies, pay for them, advertise, hunt for contracts -- allin return for 70% of Mr. Wasilewski's earnings. &quot;You'requalified. You can do a lot.&quot;   Mr. Wasilewski looks amazed. &quot;This is the firstproposition that sounds optimistic,&quot; he says.   &quot;You can manage a group of electricians employed by us,&quot;says the second man. &quot;You hire the people.&quot;   &quot;I could create a group like that]&quot;   &quot;Please think about it. Electrical things are alwaysbreaking down. It's not that difficult.&quot;   Mr. Wasilewski agrees to round up a team of electriciansand leaves, walking on air.   The risk doesn't faze him; he knows the rewards ofbreaking the state's embrace. But Marx didn't teach ambition.Most of Poland's dazed rejects, raised to believe communismowed them a living, won't be so eager to start climbing fromcapitalism's bottom rung.   &quot;There's a special psychology to Poles seeking a job,&quot;says Krzysztof Herbst, a sociologist who is setting up a bankto help the unemployed go into business. &quot;It doesn't have tobe a good job, but stable. That's the important thing. It'sgot to be permanent.&quot;   Back home from the labor office on a weekday evening,Robert and Ewa Borzecki are going over the want ads inWarsaw's morning paper. They share a cramped room in hismother's apartment with a big dog.   &quot;I'd like to find a job as a secretary,&quot; she says, sittingin the only chair. &quot;Some ordinary office work. There's an adin the paper more or less of this kind. Some foreigncompany.&quot;   &quot;It's responsible,&quot; Mr. Borzecki says. He sits on thefloor, leaning against the cupboard. &quot;You have to handlemoney. Big sums. If you make the smallest mistake, you'lllose several months' pay.&quot;   &quot;It's more than eight hours a day. No overtime,&quot; she says.Her husband sneers: &quot;Volunteer work.&quot; &quot;I called,&quot; she says.&quot;I'm supposed to go tomorrow. . . .&quot;   The new extension on Sonpol's suburban headquarters isgetting a coat of stucco late the next morning. A shipment ofplastic shampoo bottles stands outside the front entrance.Clerks at numerous desks inside answer numerous telephones.Another micro-conglomerate, owned by a Swede, Sonpol makestoiletries and packs meat. It's branching out now and needsan extra person in the purchasing department. Four candidateshave come and gone. Mrs. Borzecki is due at noon.   In his carpeted office, Tadeusz Kaminski waits.   &quot;Areas that were exclusively the state's will be givenup,&quot; says the owner's representative. &quot;A vacuum must befilled.&quot; So Sonpol is moving into milk processing,fertilizer, opening a travel agency. &quot;Of course, we can'tabsorb the whole work force laid off by the state, but we'llemploy several dozen more people.&quot;   He checks his watch. It's 12:45.   &quot;My rule is talk to everyone, consider everything. Maybethis young woman only took our ad into account. It was aminimum offer. If she has my conviction -- talk to everyone,consider everything -- she will come. If I see she haspotential, we can negotiate.&quot;   But Mrs. Borzecki doesn't seize her opportunity. At 1o'clock, she still hasn't turned up, and Mr. Kaminski goesout to lunch.</TEXT></DOC>
