The slump in oil prices hit this petroleum center hard. Taxrevenues plummeted while unemployment in Louisiana peaked last yearat around 14 percent. It remains above 10 percent.   The hard times hit right after the 1984 world's fair proved tobe a world class financial flop. It got great reviews but neverdrew the crowds local merchants had hoped for. The fair ended itssix-month run in bankruptcy court with $120 million in losses.   Barthelemy believes the GOP's decision to hold its nationalconvention in the Louisiana Superdome may signal a reversal in thecity's fortunes.   ``I think it's already meant an awful lot,''' he said. ``We werekind of on a down side from the world's fair as far as the nationalmedia was concerned.''   With 31,000 people expected, this won't be the largestconvention for New Orleans. Sixty thousand attended a religiousconference last year and 35,000 Shriners met in April.   But the GOP convention promises to attract the most money andthe most media attention.   To make sure the publicity is good, elected officials andcommunity leaders formed a host committee 17 months ago. More than10,000 volunteers are sorting mail, answering phones and paintingsigns.   Chief executive officers from the Fortune 500 companies havebeen invited to town for the convention, and helicopter tours ofindustrial areas are planned for those who want a better look.   Visiting journalists already are being flooded with informationabout the state _ including a list of New Orleans restaurants thatwill stay open to feed them after late-night deadlines.   ``The city is going to be on national and internationalnewspapers and television for a week,'' said Barthelemy. ``Youcan't buy that kind of publicity.''   To serve as host for the convention, the city agreed to raiseabout $5.5 million from private sources to pay for sound andlighting systems in the Superdome and other construction projects.After a slow start, collections are now said to be on track.   If projections in a University of New Orleans economic study panout, the money will be a good investment.   That study breaks down like this:   _With each of 21,000 hotel rooms filled for an average of sevendays, hotels will rake in more than $15 million.   _About 31,500 convention-goers are expected to spend an averageof $100 a day and generate more than $22 million during conventionweek.   _Some 200 convention staffers who took up full-time residencehere prior to the convention, some as early as March, will generatean additional $2 million.   _Even if construction spending is only 62 percent of what it wasduring the Detroit GOP convention in 1980, it will total $15million.   _The host committee is spending $650,000, bringing totalprojected direct spending to more than $55 million.   On the theory that each dollar spent will be spent again,sometimes twice, a multiplier of 1.5 was applied, adding $82million to the $55 million for a total impact of more than $137million.   State tax revenue would reach $5.7 million under thoseprojections; city tax revenue, $4.2 million.   By contrast, advance projections for the Democrats' gathering inAtlanta put the impact on the local economy at about $60 million.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 7</NOTE></DOC>
