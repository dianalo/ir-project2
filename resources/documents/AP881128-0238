They come to us to talk and if they are proposing taxes thatare too high, we say you are going to blow up the economy and youwill be kicked out of government.''   The export zone's more than 500 businesses employ more than90,000 people.   This courtship of government and industry began after the 1982elections, which themselves serve as a guide to Mauritius. Jokeswere made during that election about the economy being as dead asthe Dodo bird, which became extinct after Dutch hunters here wipedthem out several centuries ago.   An alliance led by the Jugnauth's Mauritian Militant Movement(MMM) defeated the pro-Western government, taking all 60 electedseats. But Jugnauth's government immediately began implementing thesuggestions of Western creditors.   While Jugnauth's government was slashing corporate taxes andremoving duties on many items to entice investors in the exportzone, the island also benefited from an improved world economy,lower petroleum prices and an absence of cyclones during the sugarseason. But most important was a big influx of money from Hong Kongand other Asian nations.   Some of these countries had already reached their export quotaswith Western nations and shifted production to Mauritius.   Meanwhile, Jugnauth was expelled from the MMM leadership andforced to form his own party a year after winning the election. Hisnew party, the Mauritian Socialist Movement, has led an alliancethat has won two subsequent elections.   Jugnauth's alliance controls two-thirds of the seats inParliament, although it won only 9,512 votes more than theopposition in last year's election in which 89 percent of theelectorate cast ballots.   In Mauritius terms, this is political stability and bothopposition leader Nababsing, who is with the MMM, and FinanceMinister Lutchmeenaraido credit it with a big role in the country'seconomic development.   ``I don't see any other party changing what we are doing,'' saidLutchmeenaraido.   Rather than proposing major changes in the liberal economicreforms, Nababsing says, it was his party, the former party of theprime minister, that initiated them.   Nababsing does criticize the government, saying it has been tooslow to diversify, and that growth is slowing, inflation is out ofcontrol and more attention needs to be paid to avoiding ethnicdivisions.   Since independence from Britain in 1968, governments have beencareful to avoid fanning ethnic divisions among various groups inthe Hindu majority or other groups.   Two-thirds of the population are Hindus, many of them descendantsof indentured laborers brought here by the British to work the sugarplanations.   About 28 percent are Creoles, descendants of Africans andEuropeans or Africans and Asians. About 3 percent are of Chinesedescent and the rest descendants of French or other European stock.   English is the official language but Creole, a mixture of Frenchand other languages, along with French are spoken by the vastmajority.   Road signs are in English but advertisements and newspapers arein French.   French and Creole had already been entrenched before the Englishcaptured the island from France in the 19th century. Before theFrench, the Dutch occupied the island from 1598 to 1710.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Dec. 4</NOTE></DOC>
