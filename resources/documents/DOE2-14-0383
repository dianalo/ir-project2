They find that the energystorage efficiency in these samples is 1.7 times greater than that ofour Nd:YAG sample, and the normalized heating parameter chi, definedas the heat deposited per unit of stored energy, is 2.5 under the specifiedpumping conditions, with no evident dependence on the cr/sup 3+/ concentration.The authors find that the measured chi value for the sample of Nd:YAgis 2.9 for the same pumping condition. These observed chi values exceedexpected values by factors of --1.1 and 2 for the Cr:Nd:GSGG and Nd:YAGsamples, respectively. The authors have also directly measured the thermalfocal length in the two materials; the lensing is shorter in GSGG bya factor of 2.6 for the same available output power or a factor of 4.5for the same input pump power. Finally, they have calculated the expectedthermal lensing using our measured heat loads with no adjustable parameters,achieving satisfactory agreement with the measured lensing values.</TEXT></DOC>
