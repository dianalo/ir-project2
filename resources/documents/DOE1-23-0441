When the viscosity of the oil is increased beyondprimary levels through the operation of a fireflood process, the problemis amplified significantly. Norcen began a major effort towards improvingproduction levels from high viscosity wells at the Bodo Fireflood inmid 1984. Numerous pumping systems were tested during 1985 with limitedsucccess. A joint program with the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC)to investigate the feasibility of injecting an adequate surfactant solutionto form a downhole oil-in-water emulsion was intitiated in late 1985.It was believed that improved pumping capabilities would be seen if theemulsification took place, as water would be the continuous phase leadingto much lower viscosities. Using their previous work in pipelining heavyoils as a base, SRC identified as surfactant which would produce a suitableoil-in-water emulsion. A single well field test was conducted in early1986 using a hollow rod injection system. Results were encouraging asproduction increased significantly, rod fall problems decreased and pumpingefficiencies improved. Subsequent installations in other wells showedsimilar results. 2 refs., 2 tabs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
