Macy andamp; Co. may ultimatelycollect half or less of their claims against the retailer,which total at least $275 million, Wall Street bankruptcyspecialists predict.   On Monday, Macy, one of the largest and oldest U.S.department-store groups, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-lawprotection from creditors. Macy deals with more than 20,000suppliers, from apparel makers and appliance manufacturers tonewspapers that sell it advertising space. Caught in anever-worsening cash squeeze the past few months, Macy hasn'tpaid many of its vendors since Dec. 10.</LP><TEXT>   Ordinarily, analysts say, trade suppliers have some of thestrongest claims in bankruptcy proceedings. When assets aredivided at the end of bankruptcy proceedings -- typically atwo-year wait -- trade suppliers fare much better than dobank lenders or bondholders.   In Macy's case, however, trade suppliers rank behind banksand mortgage lenders in their claim on the company's assets,says Jack Hirsch, a bankruptcy specialist at Lehman Brothers.That's because other lenders insisted on stronger positionswhen they arranged the financing for a leveraged buy-out ofMacy in 1986.   A Macy spokesman estimates the retailer's unpaid debts toits suppliers at $275 million. Normally, Wall Street analystssay, Macy has about $800 million of accounts payable. But theMacy spokesman said that as the retailer headed towardChapter 11 proceedings, its bills outstanding shrankmarkedly.   Analysts at Lehman say trade creditors would get just 55cents on the dollar in their &quot;base case&quot; assessment of howMacy's creditors will fare in Chapter 11.   More pessimistic is Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. analyst MitchBartlett, who figures that Macy's trade creditors eventuallywill be paid 32% to 44% of their claims. Mr. Bartlett expectsthat most of Macy's earnings power will be used to pay offclaims of more senior lenders.   While Wall Street firms haven't yet begun acquiring Macyvendor claims at a discount, Bear Stearns andamp; Co. trader RhodaFreeman said the firm expects to be a buyer soon. Sellers arelikely to be smaller manufacturers unwilling or unable towait as long as two years for fuller payment from Macy whenthe retailer emerges from Chapter 11.   Analysts estimate that Macy vendor claims will fetch just30 cents on the dollar when trading begins.   David L. Finkelstein, executive vice president for CenturyBusiness Credit Corp., a New York-based factoring andfinancial-services firm, said that firm has concluded tradecreditors are on the same payout level with seniorsubordinated bonds, due in 1998, and subordinated notes, duein 2001.   &quot;It's going to be a big shock to some people, because it'sgoing to mean a smaller return than many on Seventh Avenueexpect,&quot; said Mr. Finkelstein. &quot;If anybody went into thisexpecting an 80% return, they had blinkers on.&quot;   Mr. Finkelstein said Century Business expects to soonoffer to buy pre-petition Macy debt from vendors. He addedthat the firm will guarantee shipments to Macy on apost-petition basis for firms that aren't factored and areafraid to ship goods to Macy.   Suppliers expressed dismay at learning that their Macydebt may be worth only 50 cents on the dollar when theretailer emerges from Chapter 11 proceedings.   &quot;I'm surprised and intend to talk to my lawyer,&quot; said JonLevy, president of Gillian Group, a maker of women's appareland a longtime Macy vendor. &quot;We aren't owed a significantamount of money, but this is something I want to learn moreabout.&quot; Mr. Levy said he would consider selling hispre-petition Macy debt, depending on how much he was offeredand how long it will take Macy to emerge from Chapter 11protection. Meanwhile, he adds: &quot;We're ready to ship goods toMacy again. Peak spring shipping begins this week.&quot;   Shep Porter, president of Porter House Ltd., a women'ssportswear maker, also expressed surprise that the trade debtwould be treated on an equal level with the junk debtexcluding the zero coupons. Mr. Porter says his firm is owed$24,000 by the I. Magnin specialty store unit of Macy.   &quot;You always feel that you should receive full repayment,but what can you do?&quot; asked Mr. Porter. &quot;In this market, moredoors are closing than are opening. Every retailer isimportant. I intend to ship again as soon as I receive adebtor-in-possession number.&quot;   Macy has arranged to receive $600 million indebtor-in-possession financing from Chemical Banking Corp.and Bankers Trust New York Corp. Today, lawyers representingMacy are expected to ask U.S. Judge Burton Lifland to approvethe immediate use of $60 million of that facility. A hearingabout the entire facility is scheduled for Feb. 13.</TEXT></DOC>
