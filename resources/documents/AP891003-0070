Robert Garcia, who is on trial for allegedlyselling political favors to the company.   Gov. Rafael Hernandez-Colon was called by the prosecution Mondayto testify in U.S. District Court about a September 1985 meetingwith Garcia and Wedtech officials at the governor's mansion in SanJuan.   In earlier testimony, former Wedtech vice chairman Mario Morenosaid Garcia's wife, Jane Lee Garcia, arranged the meeting. Hetestified that the governor promised to ``take care'' of thecontract and do whatever he could to help Wedtech.   Hernandez-Colon confirmed the meeting took place but denied hemade any promises to the Wedtech officials there, Moreno andWedtech founder John Mariotta.   ``In no way did I say I was going to give you this contract,''he testified. ``That was beyond my authority.''   Garcia, a 56-year-old Bronx congressman, and his 48-year-oldwife are charged with conspiring to do favors for Wedtech inexchange for $185,000 in checks and interest-free loans and adiamond and emerald necklace.   One of the favors they are accused of performing was arrangingthe meeting with Hernandez-Colon. Wedtech officials sought themeeting because they wanted to win a contract to build ferry boatsfor the U.S. territory.   The governor testified that he may have suggested to officialsconsidering the ferry contract to consider Wedtech's offer to builda shipyard in Puerto Rico and offer jobs to Puerto Ricans if thecompany won the contract. Unemployment in the territory then was21.8 percent.   Under cross-examination, Hernandez-Colon said he didn't believeanything improper took place at the meeting.   A prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michele Hirshman, askedHernandez-Colon whether he would think differently if he knew thatone month earlier, Garcia had asked Wedtech for a $20,000 loan thatwould be issued to his sister but was actually for the Garcias.   ``If I were in fact certain of that as a fact, my opinion wouldbe changed,'' he said.   The Garcias have pleaded innocent to charges of extortion,conspiracy, bribery and receipt of illegal gratuities. If convictedof the most serious charge, extortion, they face up to 20 years inprison.</TEXT></DOC>
