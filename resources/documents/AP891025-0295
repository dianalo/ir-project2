Addressing reporters at the District Lodge 751 hall after twodays of visiting picket lines in Wichita, Kan., Portland, Ore., andthe Seattle area, Kourpias vowed the union would spare no effort orexpense to win.   ``I am here to tell you personally that the international unionis totally committed to seeing this strike through to victory,''Kourpias said.   In a room containing 20 eight-foot tables loaded with bread,canned goods and other food, plus a wall lined with food cartonsfive to six high, all donated, he cited similar support forstriking Pittston Co. coal workers and Eastern Airlines employees.   Carla Bowman, a striker and union volunteer worker, said fooddonations amounted to $5,000 to $10,000 at the district lodge alone.   ``I am certainly proud to be associated with the working peoplehere at Boeing who are leading the fight for fairness and justicefor working families here and throughout the land,'' Kourpias said.   The union represents 57,800 Boeing workers nationwide, including43,300 in the Seattle area, 12,000 in Wichita, 1,700 in Portland,and a few hundred at scattered sites in California, Hawaii, Utah,Montana, Wyoming and other states.   Union members voted 85 percent to strike rather than accept athree-year contract.   The contract offers pay increases of 4 percent the first year, 3percent the second and 3 percent the third; bonuses of 8 percent ofgross pay in the first year and 3 percent in the second;cost-of-living increases to cover inflation; a 20 percent reductionin mandatory overtime; and higher benefits.   Since the strike began Oct. 4, Boeing has announced orders for68 aircraft worth $4.3 billion and has delivered 11 planes, all ofwhich were virtually complete before the walkout.   The only talks during the strike collapsed after less than fourhours Oct. 18, and no more meetings have been scheduled.   Major issues are wages, mandatory overtime, pensions, health andwelfare payments and standards for promotions.   Distribution of strike pay of $100 a week per striker beginsThursday. The last paychecks for work done before the strike wereissued last week.   Neither Kourpias nor district lodge president Tom Baker wouldpredict how long the strike could last.   Kourpias said fewer than 1 percent of union-covered workers werecrossing picket lines.   With a strike fund of $95 million and 850,000 members payinginto the fund weekly, strike pay of $100 a week could be maintained``as long as it takes,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
