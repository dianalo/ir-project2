Augusto Pinochet is eagerly pursuing a neweight-year mandate.   He remains firmly in control of the military. But anincreasingly unified and confident opposition predicts hispolitical demise before the anniversary rolls around again nextyear.   Commander of the country's fiercely disciplined army, Pinochetled the Sept. 11, 1973, coup that toppled the elected government ofa Marxist, Salvador Allende, during a period of widespread socialand economic upheaval.   That same day, the armed forces solemnly announced by radio thatthey were ``assuming power only for as long as circumstances demandit.'' The statement was interpreted by most Chileans that a returnto the long tradition of democratic rule would be swift.   Instead, a decade and a half later, Pinochet has launched a hugecampaign to persuade his countrymen that circumstances demand heremain in power until 1997 and that they they must vote accordinglyin an Oct. 5 presidential referendum.   In a clear demonstration that his military power base remainsstrong, Pinochet recently won the quick and unanimous backing ofhis fellow armed forces commanders for his sole candidacy in thereferendum.   The 72-year-old general had been campaigning hard for thenomination and had behind him the fervent backing of the army, byfar the most powerful military branch.   If he wins the referendum, he will begin a new eight-year termnext March 11. If he loses, he remains in power another year untilan open election is called and will hand power over to the winnerin March 1990.   Whether he wins or loses, a Congress will be elected in 1990 forthe first time since it was disbanded at the time of the coup. Butthe legislature will be virtually powerless to amend a 1980constitution, crafted by Pinochet's administration, that gives themilitary autonomy and a strong supervisory role in national affairs.   Most polls how Pinochet lacking sufficient voter support. In anevident bid to increase his popularity, he has been easingpolitical restrictions and cultivating a new, conciliatory imagethat contrasts with his harshly authoritarian reputation.   He decreed an end to states of emergency in effect since he tookpower and lifted a ban on the return of all leftists in exile. Manyof them were expelled or fled during a wave of fierce repressionthat followed the coup.   ``Let's bury in forgetfulness that which keeps us apart,''Pinochet declared to critics in an ``open letter'' published bySantiago newspapers last week.   In speech after speech, he maintains that Chile needs his strongleadership to wrap up reforms that will produce a new democracy,with effective safeguards against international Marxism and astrong-free market economy.   A saturation campaign of pro-government advertisements ontelevision, radio and in the press contends that his defeat wouldmean a return to the political and social chaos of the Allendeyears. It protrays his leading critics as politically bankrupt,quarrelsome hacks intent on personal gain.   But after years of deep division, 16 opposition parties rangingfrom center-right to far left have united in an unusually coherenteffort to defeat Pinochet at the ballot box.   The coalition, called the Command for the No Vote, has launchedits own low-budget but well organized campaign. Its advertisementsrecall Pinochet's promises not to remain in power forever anddeclare, ``No more lies.''   Opposition leaders who once spent most of their time arguing nowappear together at anti-government rallies and forums, declaringconfidently that Pinochet's days are numbered. A Sept. 4 rallyattracted more than 100,000 people in what organizers called thebiggest anti-government demonstration since the coup.   They also have agreed on a general political platform thatpromises greater emphasis on social benefits but no revolutionaryeconomic or political changes. If Pinochet loses the referendum,they plan negotiations with the armed forces to speed up hisdeparture, amend the constitution and hold quick elections for afour-year transition government.   Genero Arrigiada, a centrist Christian Democrat who issecretary-general of the coalition, said the opposition's new unityis the result of a long and painful maturing process.   He said party leaders now realize that their own infightingallowed Pinochet to seize power and to retain it.   ``Just as Sept. 11 (1973) was the culmination of a deeppolitical division, this campaign is the expression of just theopposite,'' he said. ``It's the end of the war between theparties.''   Asked if he expected Pinochet to still be in power next Sept.11, he replied: ``No. This is the last one.''</TEXT></DOC>
