 He had about 750 servers spread throughout 14buildings, connecting 6,000 personal computers and a variety of VAXes andAS/400 minicomputers.andP;  He was headed for an Ethernet gridlock that would makeany system manager's eyes cross.andM;The solution to Leinweber's problem was clearly a high-speed backbone, but atthat time--1-1/2 years ago--no Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)products had made their way to the marketplace.andP;  Through a combination ofsavvy, investigation and long-term planning, Leinweber last summer effected anearly painless crossover to a 100Mbit-per-second (Mbps) fiber-optic backboneusing hardware from Santa Clara, Calif.'s Ungermann-Bass that was designed tocomply with the emerging FDDI standard.andM;Microsoft networking woes started when the company decided to move about 350of its servers into a central computing location.andP;  Although the move cutsupport costs and made backups somewhat easier, Leinweber said it put analmost unmanageable load on the existing network.andM;&quot;We were beginning to have more and more trouble with our 10Mbps backbone,&quot;Leinweber said.andP;  &quot;It was clear that we were trouble [and that] these troubleswould only increase in severity unless we did something.&quot;andM;At times, he said, the network was handling between 6,000 and 8,000 packetsper second, a far higher rate than is acceptable.andP;  Because of the density,&quot;the bridges were fading in and out,&quot; causing packets to be dropped, he said.andM;Leinweber knew he needed something with more bandwidth and sold his managerson the idea with little trouble.andP;  But when he wanted an FDDI-compliantnetwork--not &quot;near FDDI&quot; or &quot;almost FDDI.&quot;andP;  He wanted the real thing.andM;Proprietary fiber-optic backbones, such as those from Proteon of Westborough,Mass., or Artel of Hudson, Mass., &quot;would solve the problem of the backbonebut [provide] nothing for the future of moving us to high-performance fileservers,&quot; Leinweber said.andM;Leinweber turned to Fibronics International of Hyannis, Mass., which did nothave any released products, but &quot;were kind enough ...andP;  to show us what theywere [planning].&quot;andM;With the information from Fibronics, &quot;I sold the idea to management that[file servers on a backbone] was basically dcable,&quot; he said.andP;  But instead ofusing Fibronics products, Leinweber turned to Ungermann-Bass, which hadprovided most of the networking equipment that Microsoft was using at thetime.andP;  Although Ungermann-Bass did not have an FDDI product line ready forpurchase, development was in progress.andM;While waiting to implement the Ungermann-Bass hardware, Leinweber bought timeby subdividing Microsoft's Ethernet to limit the load on the overall network.andO;Although this tactic did not always improve the performance, &quot;if [thenetwork] is going down twice a day, having it run a little slower [but not godown] is still an improvement,&quot; he said.andP;  Last spring, Microsoft began alphatesting and beta testing the FDDI products from Ungermann-Bass, and by Junethe FDDI backbone had been fully implemented.andM;Although the company was acting as a test site for Ungermann-Bass, Leinwebersaid Microsoft paid the full $25,000 for each bridge.andP;  The cabling cost$175,000, bringing the full cost of the FDDI network to $750,000, he said.andM;Like most others who have implemented high-speed backbone networks at thisearly--and expensive--stage of the technology, Leinweber does not expectMicrosoft to realize an immediate financial return from installing thehigh-speed network.andP;  Rather, he saw FDDI as way to solve the capacityproblems of the current network while preparing for the future networkingrequirements of his rapidly growing company.andM;Currently, Microsoft is using only 15 percent of the FDDI backbone'scapacity, Leinweber said.andP;  But, he added, &quot;that doesn't stop me from planningand thinking about where we are going&quot; and about the day when fiber will runto the desktop.andM;Although Leinweber demanded--and got--an FDDI-standard network, theUniversity of Illinois settled for a proprietary backbone network.andP;  In fact,it settled for three of them.andM;All told, the university has invested $1 million in its network, whichincludes three 80Mbps ProNet 80 fiber-optic backbone rings and two 10Mbpsfiber-optic rings, all supplied by Proteon.andM;The university has thousands of computers, ranging from a Cray to PCs; 200buildings; and dozens of individual, buildingwide LANs using Ethernet and IBMToken-Ring protocols.andM;&quot;Because we are a university, we want to be state-of-art,&quot; said SueGreenberg, assistant director of the computing services office for theUniversity of Illinois.andP;  So, more than three years ago, the universityapplied for and received a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF)for a state-of-the-art backbone network.andM;The network started with a single ring to link 12 subnetwork gateways.andP;  Butonce others at the university saw the capabilities of the network, theywanted to jump on the fiber-optic network as well.andM;That eagerness saved Greenberg some trouble.andP;  &quot;The engineering collegedecided to add their own network,&quot; Greenberg said.andP;  The college, which has 34buildings, kicked in the funds for its piece of the network.andP;  Later, about 35buildings were added to the backbone rings.andM;Greenberg's plans to link the whole campus over high-speed backbones wereaided by another fortuitous circumstance.andM;&quot;We were installing a telephone network on campus,&quot; she said, &quot;so [while] wewere digging the campus up ...andP;  we got them to install fiber&quot; along with thetelephone lines.andP;  Today, &quot;we have fiber going to almost every building oncampus,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;That's 18 miles of cable and 200 buildings.&quot;andM;Between the NSF grant money, the engineering department's escalated interestand funding, and the opportunity to piggyback fiber-optic cable onto thecabling of a project already scheduled, the computing office got virtually afree ride through the initial phase of its network.andM;To expand the backbone, however, Greenberg had to turn to the university forfunds.andP;  The chancellor's office established a committee to develop anetworking plan.andP;  In the resuling plan, the committee recommended a networkthat would be easily accessible from any location on campus and capable oflinking disparate subnetworks.andP;  The committee also determined that thenetwork would require a standard protocol and should permit the developmentof campuswide services.andM;Greenberg said she &quot;had to work really hard&quot; to sell the idea.andP;  But inDecember, her work paid off when the faculty committee granted her anadditional $3.5 million to ring the entire campus.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
