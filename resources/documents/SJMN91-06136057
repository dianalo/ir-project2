Last year's winner, musicteacher David Anderson (you may know him as pro saxophonist David Ladd), hasbeen given his pink slip, a result of cutbacks that place music education inthe frill category. In today's climate of school financial shortfalls, aTeacher of the Year certificate and four-bits isn't good for much more than acup of coffee. . . . There's also a quiet controversy percolating at MenloCollege, where the student newspaper, The Oak, ran a story revealing thesalaries of private college administrators -- including Menlo's. None of itwas privileged information -- an enterprising student reporter simply usedstate disclosure laws -- but some high honchos weren't exactly pleased by thedisclosure. No heads have rolled, yet, but the atmosphere is a trifle tense.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TEACHING AWARD DOESN'T PROMISE ANY JOB SECURITY  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     SHOW BUSY -- &quot;Angry Housewives,&quot; San Jose Stage Company'sshow-that-wouldn't-die, marks its second anniversary Thursday at Los Gatos'Old Town Theater. On hand will be Jonathan Williams -- the show's originalpunk rock teen who had time to take a year off for study at CaliforniaInstitute of the Arts and now returns to the cast -- and someone in theaudience who'll become the 40,000th person to see the show, which is good fora couple of season tickets. &quot;Housewives&quot; now is expected to run only throughJune -- but they said that a year ago. . . . San Jose Repertory Theatre'sworld premiere of Holly Near's &quot;Fire in the Rain . . . Singer in the Storm&quot; isset for tonight with a world premiere-type audience, as well. Among thosescheduled to attend: Michael Tucker of &quot;L.A. Law,&quot; culinary maven MollieKatzen (&quot;Moosewood Cookbook&quot;) and Mayor Susan Hammer. . . . Speaking ofaudiences, the Deadheads -- those thousands of hippies who follow the GreatfulDead from concert to concert -- are doing more than grooving to the music.Many make money by selling handmade or imported articles outside the shows, sothey're now contributing part of those profits to charities through anorganization called the Deadhead Vendors Collective. After last weekend'sshows at the Shoreline Amphitheater, for example, the collective passed along$1,430 to the Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic, the Seva Foundation and theAlameda County Community Food Bank. Which are, appropriately, grateful.;   POLITICKLES -- Former Cupertino Councilman John Plungy has been mentioned as apossible candidate for either the Assembly or another council term, but heheld out for the presidency instead. That's president of the Fremont EducationAssociation, representing high school teachers in Cupertino and Sunnyvale,which voted him in after Plungy promised he'd seek no other elective officeduring his two-year term. . . . As for Julie Sabadin, who's been listed as apossible candidate for San Jose Councilwoman Pat Sausedo's seat, I get thefeeling that she's more than possible. Will she run? Will the sun come uptomorrow?;    WEDDING BELL BLUES -- All the limos cruising through downtownSan Jose last weekend weren't heading for school proms. In a real biggie -- sobig this limo had a built-in hot tub -- were Mark Collishaw and 13 buddies,out for a bachelor party organized by 49er Greg Cox. Collishaw, son of JackCollishaw of the Collishaw clan, marries Kelly Doan May 26. . . . Meanwhile,outside San Jose's Victory Outreach Church on Saturday, a limo for newlywedsJohn and Bernadette Cannon parks out front. The minister who marries themparks directly behind. And a meter maid, no romantic, parks next and tags bothvehicles. John's uncle Mike Cannon, who is a romantic, says he's making copiesof both tags for the wedding album.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Leigh Weimers column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910515  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  623  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday May 15, 199100136057,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
