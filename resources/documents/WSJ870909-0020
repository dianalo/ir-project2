The offering, which will consist of 5.5 million common shares to be sold in the U.S., will raise Bankers Trust's ratio of equity to assets to about 4.6% from 4.1%. A Bankers Trust spokesman said the bank holding company couldn't estimate the dilutive effect of the offering since Bankers hasn't forecast 1988 earnings.    In July, Bankers Trust added $700 million to its loan-loss reserves for shaky Latin American debt, part of an industrywide move triggered by Citicorp's $3 billion addition to its reserves.    The spokesman said Bankers Trust plans to complete the offering by the middle of next week. This means that the sale would probably be finished before a previously announced $1 billion stock offering by Citicorp and a $250 million offering by Manufacturers Hanover Corp.    Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. will be the lead manager for the offering. Co-managers will be Salomon Brothers Inc. and Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
