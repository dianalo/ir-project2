The cis-dihydrodiols are then convertedto the corresponding catechols by dihydrodiol dehydrogenase enzymes.Pseudomonas sp. strain JS6 uses a similar system for growth on tolueneor dichlorobenzenes. We tested the wild-type organisms and a series ofmutants for their ability to transform substituted phenols after inductionwith toluene. When grown on toluene, both wild-type organisms convertedmethyl-, chloro-, and nitro-substituted phenols to the correspondingcatechols. Mutant strains deficient in dihydrodiol dehydrogenase or catecholoxygenase activities also transformed the phenols. Oxidation of phenolswas closely correlated with the induction and activity of the toluenedioxygenase enzyme system.</TEXT></DOC>
