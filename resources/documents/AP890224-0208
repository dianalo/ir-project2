The president said he was notquestioning the motivation of key Senate Democrats who have opposedthe Tower nomination.   The nomination, rejected on an 11-9 party-line vote in the SenateArmed Services Committee, goes before the full Senate later nextweek.   ``I wouldn't be in a fight if I didn't think we could win it,''Bush said in remarks to reporters shortly before leaving Tokyo onSaturday morning, Tokyo time.   Tower has been battling allegations of excessive drinking andwomanizing, as well as questions about possible conflict of intereststemming from the hundreds of thousands of dollars he earned as adefense consultant earlier in the decade.   Bush said many opponents had noted perceptions of Tower'sproblems, and added, ``That's not a fair enough, not a high enoughstandard.''   Earlier Bush had said, ``I stand strongly behind'' theappointment and arranged for a personal lobbying campaign when hereturns home.   Suggestions from majority Democrats that Tower withdraw and averta bruising battle between the Bush administration and the Senatenext week were brushed aside.   Tower met at the White House with Senate Republican Leader BobDole and Vice President Dan Quayle for a strategy session, and Dolesaid afterwards there was no talk of a possible withdrawal.   Dole added Bush would be meeting individually next week with 10or so potential Democratic supporters in hopes of salvaging thenomination.   Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate, meaning that Bushmust pick up at least five Democrats to assure Tower's confirmation.Dole said he believed all 45 Republicans were behind Tower.   In his Friday remarks in Japan, Bush said, ``I want them(senators) to know how strongly I feel. And I feel it's not apersonal win or lose, it's what's right, who is best to run theDefense Department. And that's what's at stake. And I'm going to winthis battle.''   Dole also said the White House is at work preparing a summary ofthe confidential FBI file on Tower that can be released to thepublic in hopes of demonstrating that allegations him are baseless.   The committee roll call transformed what had been a debate overTower's fitness into a fierce partisan battle over a president'sright to pick the members of his own Cabinet, and Dole made clearthe stakes involved for Bush.   ``This is the president's first controversial vote and I think hehas a right to expect all of us to support him,'' he said of theRepublicans.   At the same time he said, ``I hope there's no party effort toline up every Democrat against John Tower.''   He said a pitched partisan battle could ``be an end to thehoneymoon for both Georges _ the president and Senate MajorityLeader Mitchell, D-Maine.''   Mitchell said in a statement he has not decided how to vote,adding that whatever the outcome, ``I sincerely hope that we cancontinue to work with the administration'' on the nation's problems.   Despite the fighting words from Republicans, one conservativeDemocrat said ``it would be best'' if Tower withdrew. ``Difficultand controversial decisions will have to be made at the DefenseDepartment during the next four years,'' said Sen. David Boren ofOklahoma.   ``When controversial decisions have to e implemented, it becomeseven more difficult when the decision maker himself is controversialfor other reasons. We need a defense secretary that can garner moreunified support.''   One Democrat on Bush's list of possible votes is Sen. HowellHeflin of Alabama. Another was Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a senator fromTexas who introduced his former colleague warmly at his confirmationhearing several weeks ago. Both men told reporters they wereundecided on the nomination and would make up their minds afterreading the FBI report.   Administration officials also contacted Sen. Chris Dodd, aliberal Democrat from Connecticut, to meet with Bush. One officialnoted that Tower was been one of only five senators _ and one ofonly two Republicans _ to vote against a resolution censuring Dodd'sfather, Sen. Thomas Dodd, in 1967. A spokesman for Dodd said he wasundecided.   Some Democrats were clearly hoping the nomination wouldn't cometo a floor vote.   Boren, who said he hasn't made up his mind, issued a statementcalling on Tower to withdraw.   Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia said after casting hiscommittee vote that withdrawal would be wise and predicted swiftconfirmation for a replacement nominee.   Mitchell, at a breakfast meeting with reporters, said he wasn'tsuggesting withdrawal. But he said he was certain that ``thepresident will consider all the possible options, including thatone,'' and added that a replacement nominee would probably beconfirmed ``in a relatively short period of time.''   But Bush wouldn't hear of it. ``I stand strongly with JohnTower,'' he told reporters. ``He is my choice, my only choice, and Iam standing with him.''</TEXT></DOC>
