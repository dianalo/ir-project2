The first round of tests is designed to assess the safety of thedrug, called CD4, rather than its effectiveness, but researchershope the drug will open new avenues to attack the virus that causesacquired immune deficiency syndrome.   The drug mimics a protein normally found on the surface ofimmune system cells that are susceptible to the AIDS virus.   Researchers hope the experimental drug will, in effect, fool thedeadly virus into harmlessly attaching itself to the injectedsubstance rather than the similar receptors on immune system cells.   Similar studies will begin in a few days at San FranciscoGeneral Hospital and New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston.   About 50 patients will be involved in the first round of testsof the drug which is manufactured by Genentech Inc. of South SanFrancisco, Calif.   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immunesystem, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases andinfections. The virus most often is spread through close contactwith blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. Itschief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users.   As of Monday, AIDS had been diagnosed in 70,208 Americans, ofwhom more than half, 39,620, had died, according to the federalCenters for Disease Control. No one is known to have recovered fromAIDS.</TEXT></DOC>
