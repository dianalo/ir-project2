DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Bush administration is citing ``a threatto presidential authority'' in a legal motion to block access byprivate groups to White House records stored on computer tapes suchas those that figured in the Iran-Contra affair.   The Justice Department said in its motion that a Sept. 15decision by U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey permittingcitizens to sue the president to block destruction of the tapes is``of extreme significance'' to the president's ability to carry outhis constitutional duties.   In addition, department lawyers argued in the motion filedWednesday, the decision ``has far-reaching impact for thegovernment as a whole'' because of the widespread use of computers.   ``Making that determination for literally hundreds of thousandsof computer entries is simply not feasible,'' the department said.   At issue is whether such tapes might contain information thatmust be preserved under the Presidential Records Act passed in1978. The White House maintains that it gave employes adequateguidelines to determine whether specific computer messages wereimportant enough to be preserved as presidential records.   Richey, however, said that at least some of the messages thathad been slated for destruction ``may qualify for retention underthe pertinent recordkeeping statutes.''   The department is asking Richey to have the decision sentdirectly to the U.S. Court of Appeals instead of having furtherproceedings in the trial court. which is hearing a lawsuit filed onthe next-to-last day of the Reagan administration.   The National Security Archives, a Washington nonprofit groupthat researches national security issues, sued to prevent thescheduled destruction of 12 days worth of electronic messages in asystem used by more than 300 employee in the National SecurityCouncil and other agencies of the Executive Office of the President.   Investigators used such computer tapes to reconstruct evidencein the Iran-Contra affair.   Lawyers for the National Security Archives have said that if theappeal is not granted, they will ask the White House to describethe general contents of the tapes through the legal process ofdiscovery in preparation for a trial.   If the appeal is granted and the appeals court overrules Richey,the Justice Department said the parties would be ``spared theburden of unnecessary and particularly troubling discovery.''   The department said the stepped-up appeal process ``isespecially appropriate'' because of the ``threat to the president'sauthority.''   ``Requiring defendants to await a final decision after furtherprolonged litigation would be disruptive of the president'sability'' to carry out his duties under the Constitution, thedepartment said.   The department lawyers said that as far as they could find outthis is the first case ever to consider whether the president issubject to suit under the Administrative Practices Act, as Richeysaid he is.   The act has in the past been used to enable individuals tochallenge ``arbitrary and capricious'' actions by agencies of theexecutive branch.   The Justice Department said in its motion that the plaintiffs inthe case apparently seek to establish whether, for each computerentry, ``each individual employee faithfully applied statutorycriteria to determine the `record' status of entries and thenpreserved `record' information.''   Other plaintiffs in the suit include the American LibraryAssociation, the American Historical Association, the Center forNational Security Studies of the American Civil Liberties Union andseveral individuals.   The plaintiffs have until Oct. 9 to reply to the motion.</TEXT></DOC>
