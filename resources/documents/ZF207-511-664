(800) 544-7551, (508) 875-6100.andM;List Price: Five users, $395; unlimited user version, $995; &quot;intelligent&quot; I/Ocontroller card for two users, $495; for eight users, $1,995.andM;Requires: 2MB RAM, 2MB disk space, 80386-based PC, one or more PCTermterminals, DOS 3.3.andM;In Short: A fast multiuser, multitasking operating system that works withMS-DOS.andP;  Its compatibility and reliability rate high.andP;  The system performsbest when the number of heavy users is limited to eight.andM;Alloy Computer Products' 386/MultiWare is a fast multiuser, multitaskingoperating system environment that works with Microsoft DOS.andP;  Alloy rewroteits original resource-sharing software, NTNX, to use the features of the80386.andP;  A five-user version of the package costs $395, and an unlimited userversion sells for $995.andM;386/MultiWare supports up to 20 terminals through Alloy's IntelligentMultiPort cards (IMP).andP;  Alloy offers a two- and an eight-port version of theIMP.andP;  These cards have on-board memory and a communications processor thatmakes it easier for the 80386 to run programs while the IMP handlescommunications to the terminals.andP;  A variety of terminals called &quot;PCTerm&quot; aresupported, including ones with multiple I/O ports and Hercules graphics.andP;  Theprice of the IMPs are $495 and $1,995 respectively.andM;In order to buy the proper IMP, system managers not only need to determinethe number of users, but which tasks each user will undertake.andP;  The two-portcards support text only, and the eight-port cards support up to four graphicsand four text terminals.andM;The installation program is information and quick: the user tell the programwhere to install the software, and the rest is automatic.andP;  The programdisplays the directory structure and the types of files it creates.andP;  Apossible improvement on the installation program might be an ability tomodify the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to give a choice of running 386/MultiWare orDOS.andM;CUSTOMIZED TERMINALSandM;Alloy allows complete customization of the terminals by giving each userunique CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.andP;  In addition, each terminal can runup to eight different programs at the same time.andP;  You could, for example, useword-processing software, enter accounting data, and work on a spreadsheet atthe same time.andP;  386/MultiWare virtualizes the screens of each program,allowing ill-behaved programs to operate in the background without writingdirectly to the foreground screen.andM;386/MultiWare is compatible with most multiuser, multitasking softwarewritten for Novell's NetWare, IBM's PC Local Area Network Program, and IBM'sDOS 3.1 file-locking calls.andP;  We successfully tested a variety of network andmultiuser applications.andP;  Alloy includes some helpful hints for makingnonnetworkable and custom software perform correctly.andM;System managers will like the built-in security features of 386/MultiWare.andO;Users are assigned privilege levels (1 through 4).andP;  Level 1 is for thesupervisor, and level 4 is for the lowest user capabilities.andP;  This schemeallows the manager to restrict how many tasks a user can run.andM;386/MultiWare also includes a utility that manages security at the directorylevel.andP;  You can limit access to a directory so that only a specific group ofpeople can see it.andP;  A person may belong to up to eight such access groups.andO;This security scheme allows users to share some restricted directories whilemaintaining some private ones.andP;  This security scheme isn't as elaborate asthose found in LAN software today, but it is probably adequate for mostinstallations.andM;VIRTUAL ISOLATIONandM;One of the best features of 386/MultiWare is its ability to run in thevirtual 8086 mode of the 80386.andP;  This mode allows each terminal and eachterminal's session to be completely isolated from any other.andP;  For example, ifsomeone walks up to the console and hits Ctrl-Alt-Del, only the session inthe foreground on the console is rebooted.andP;  This also holds true for aterminal that has a program crash; that terminal can be restarted withoutinterrupting other users.andM;Alloy's 386/MultiWare performed well on our throughput tests.andP;  Some of itsspeed comes from the &quot;smart&quot; RS-232C multiport card that relieves theprocessor of many I/O handling chores.andP;  But the Alloy product also benefitsfrom an excellent disk-caching system.andP;  The throughput of the timed testactually increases as the Database Load Test increases.andP;  These tests wererepeated several times with consistent results.andP;  We have seen this pattern ofincreasing throughput before in LANs using Novell's NetWare and attribute itto disk-caching algorithms optimized for a specific load.andM;Alloy did leave out a few features some users would have appreciated.andP;  Userson the terminals do not get to take advantage of the math coprocessor or useextra memory for LIM emulation if it is present in the host.andP;  NetBIOS supportfor electronic mail and gateway systems is also absent.andM;Alloy's print spooler supports four parallel printers and as many serialprinters as there are available COM ports.andP;  Additionally, you can print to alocal printer attached to the auxiliary port available on many terminals.andO;Each user can redirect his output to any port on the system.andP;  The spoolerthen queues the output and sends it to the proper device along with aseparator page describing where the job originated.andM;386/MultiWare is an excellent product and top contender in the young 386multiuser operating system market.andP;  Alloy starts with the Microsoft DOS OEMkit to maintain maximum compatibility, then rewrites the file-handlingroutines to increase speed in a multiuser environment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
