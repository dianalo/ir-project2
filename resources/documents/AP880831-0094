The two ships are the first to be stationed in Japan withlaunchers for Tomahawk missiles, which are made in both nuclear andnon-nuclear versions.   ``Get out from Yokosuka!'' 100 people shouted in English at thegates of the naval base as the Ticonderoga-class, guided missilecruiser USS Bunker Hill and the destroyer USS Fife arrived in theport, 30 miles southwest of Tokyo.   A coast guard official said the warships arrived withoutincident.   Forty-two coast guard patrol boats escorted the ships into theport to prevent the approach of 28 small boats carrying protestersand banners reading ``No Tomahawks,'' the official said. He spokeon condition of anonymity.   Japan forbids the production, possession, or introduction intothe country of nuclear weapons. Nearly 200,000 people died in theJapanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the world's onlyatomic attacks, during World War II.   After the arrival of the ships, more protesters from civic andpeace groups, labor unions and the Japan Communist Party stagedseparate rallies at a park overlooking the port, outside the navalbase and elsewhere. Police reported no arrests.   Protesters said the biggest rally, sponsored by the communists,drew an estimated 1,000 people.   On Tuesday, Yokosuka's 48-member city assembly unanimouslypassed a resolution calling on the government to cancel the arrivalof the U.S. warships. The mayor and governor lodged officialprotests Monday with the Japanese government, saying it had notdone enough to ensure that the ships were not carrying nuclearweapons.   Local officials and civic groups have charged the ships may becarrying nuclear-tipped Tomahawk missiles, in violation of Japan'santi-nuclear policy.   ``We hope our grassroot struggles will spread to a nationalmovement,'' said Yoshiko Saito, a leader of a citizens' groupstaging a sit-in near the Yokosuka city hall.   Both the 9,600-ton Bunker Hill and the 7,810-ton Fife arecapable of deploying Tomahawk missiles. Under a security agreement,the United States has pledged to notify Japan if it plans to bringnuclear arms into the country.   However, critics charge the Japanese government uses theagreement as a way of avoiding the question of whether U.S. shipsdock in the country with nuclear weapons aboard.   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita told reporters today that thegovernment would not ask the United States to confirm whether ornot the ships were carrying nuclear missiles, because ``we trusteach other in such matters,'' Kyodo News Service reported.   The U.S. military, which has 50,000 personnel stationed inJapan, maintains a policy of not publicly confirming or denying theexistence of nuclear weapons aboard its ships.</TEXT></DOC>
