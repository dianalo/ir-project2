Heavyweight champion James &quot;Buster&quot; Douglas, in a trialset to begin Monday, is directing his legal blows at DonKing, the famous fight promoter. What's at stake, beyond thecareers of Messrs. King and Douglas, is the validity of thewidely used contracts that endow promoters with the muscle todictate where and whom their boxers fight.</LP><TEXT>   A top promoter such as Mr. King may invest as much as$600,000 to $1 million to advance a fighter's career from hisfirst professional bout to the hoped-for championship(although Mr. King rarely works with a fighter just startingout). The promoter guarantees a boxer's salary, pays hisexpenses for training and travel, and supplies free tickets.In turn, the promoter gets all or a cut of television andticket revenue and all merchandising rights.   For a boxer such as Mr. Douglas, the catch is that thepromoter cushions his own risk by signing the fighter tolong-term contracts that prohibit the boxer from dealing withother promoters. And since multimillion-dollar fight pursesrarely go to anyone but champions, smart promoters wangleexclusive rights to control a contender's career for severalfights after a championship bout.   That's the subject of the bitter legal dispute betweenchampion boxer and champion promoter. Mr. King says he isbacked solidly by American contract law, and many legalexperts agree.   Last year, Mr. Douglas signed a contract with Mr. Kingthat covered the title fight and three subsequent bouts. Thecontract, the latest in a series between the fighter andpromoter, gave Mr. King the right to negotiate the packagefor each fight. Mr. Douglas could get out of the contract ifhe were to be paid less than $1 million per bout.   That kind of payday was highly unlikely for Mr. Douglas, ajourneyman fighter who wasn't considered championshipmaterial. But Mr. Douglas accomplished the improbable bybeating then-undefeated heavyweight champion Mike Tyson inFebruary. Mr. King offered the new champ $11 million for hisfirst title defense, a hefty payday but not as much as Mr.Douglas -- newly acquainted with television interviews,magazine covers and home-town parades -- had in mind.   An offer by Mirage Casino Hotel owner Steve Wynn was morelike it: He promised Mr. Douglas $25 million, part of a $60million package for the rights to stage and promote twofights at the casino in Las Vegas. Exclusive contracts suchas Mr. King's are prohibited in Nevada, and Mr. Wynn wantsthe glamour fights so he can draw high rollers to hisgambling tables. Since Mr. Wynn upped the ante, otherpromoters have attempted to woo Mr. Douglas with prospects ofas much as $50 million for a rematch with Mr. Tyson.   In an effort to invalidate the King contract and gain thefreedom to negotiate with others, Mr. Douglas filed suit inLas Vegas in February. In his complaint, Mr. Douglas contendsthat he had to swallow Mr. King's terms or lose a shot at theheavyweight championship. Mr. King had all the bargainingpower because he held the promotional rights to Mr. Tyson,then the champion, the suit maintains. &quot;Why should we have totake less money?&quot; asks John Johnson, Mr. Douglas's manager.&quot;Don't we have a right to say yes or no?&quot;   Mr. Douglas also contends that Mr. King breached thecontract when he took Mr. Tyson's side in a dispute over theoutcome of their Tokyo title fight.   Mr. King has countersued in federal court in New York. Heis asking for more than $25 million in damages from Mr.Douglas for breach of contract, and he seeks a court order tostop a proposed September fight at the Mirage Casino. He'salso asking for more than $50 million from Mr. Wynn forallegedly interfering with his contract with Mr. Douglas.   Mr. Douglas's suit has become a rallying point for thosewho denounce exclusive contracts as a form of indenturedservitude that unfairly enriches the promoters. These criticssay it's common for promoters to reap 20% and more of afight's revenue while the boxer's salary can amount to lessthan 10%. When the promoter controls both contestants, as Mr.King often does, he takes home twice as much for the samework.   A victory for Mr. Douglas might encourage a host of boxersto tear up their contracts with promoters and enter a new eraof free agency in which they could negotiate terms on afight-by-fight basis. It would also weaken the flamboyant Mr.King's powerful hold on the industry. For more than a decade,Mr. King has had contracts with either the leading contendersor the champion, or both, in the heavyweight division, whichcommands the most prize money.   Lawyers who deal with contracts such as Mr. Douglas's,however, caution that exclusive agreements are generallyenforced by courts. John Sahl, who teaches sports andentertainment law at the University of Bridgeport (Conn.),says that such contracts are common in the boxing businessand haven't been ruled as any different than similararrangements in the recording industry. Personally, he says,he views them as inherently unfair but says they are probablynot illegal.   &quot;They're not fighting me,&quot; says Mr. King. &quot;They'refighting American contract law.&quot; He insists that hiscontracts are fair because they reward the promoter's riskwhile giving fighters with no other backing the opportunityto get a shot at the title. He adds that boxers do well underthe promotional contracts; he says he has negotiated paydaysof $1 million or more for about 15 fighters.   &quot;Buster Douglas is the best living example of the risk apromoter takes in investing in a fighter,&quot; Mr. King says.Indeed, before the Tyson fight, Mr. Douglas was nobody's ideaof a hot property. During his nine-year career, the Columbus,Ohio, native compiled a 29-4-1 record but sometimes came tofights overweight and fought listlessly. Mr. Johnson, hismanager, says he was &quot;too nice.&quot; His father and trainer,Billy, a former middleweight boxer, forsook him after he quitin his title fight against Tony Tucker in 1987.   &quot;Nobody was interested in Douglas,&quot; says Don Duva, thepromoter who represents top heavyweight contender EvanderHolyfield. &quot;He was a non-entity.&quot;   Mr. King says he invested in promoting Mr. Douglas asearly as 1984 and continued to do business with him becausehe saw talent in him that others didn't. He also got a boxerto use on the &quot;undercard,&quot; preliminary bouts at big fights.In August 1989, Mr. Douglas gave Mr. King control of possiblytwo years of his career for a promise that Mr. Tyson, whomMr. King also represents, would fight him. Stephen Enz, theattorney who represented Mr. Douglas at the time, says, &quot;Wehad other offers to consider, but the road to thechampionship only ran through Don King. You have to deal withDon King on his terms.&quot;   But despite the claims from the Douglas corner, MikeTrainer, a lawyer and manager of middleweight champion SugarRay Leonard, points out that Mr. Douglas had an alternative:fighting all the top contenders to qualify for a guaranteedtitle fight under boxing association rules, with or withoutMr. King. &quot;He could have . . . been declared a mandatorycontender,&quot; says Mr. Trainer, &quot;Nobody put a gun to his head.He didn't have to sign it.&quot;   An important side issue in the lawsuits will involve Mr.King's role in arguing before the World Boxing Associationthat Mr. Douglas should have lost the Tyson bout because thereferee allowed him too much time to get up after he wasknocked down in the eighth round. Mr. Douglas knocked Mr.Tyson out in the 10th round.   The question will be whether Mr. King's fiduciary duty toMr. Douglas obligated him to muzzle himself. Some say Mr.King did what the contract called for -- promote his fighter-- and that was his only duty. Others say as a promoter forboth fighters, Mr. King had a duty to remain neutral.   Most lawyers and promoters agree that, as in his lastfight, Mr. Douglas will be an underdog in the courtroom. Andjust about everyone predicts that somehow Mr. King will stillbe in the picture the next time Mr. Douglas puts on hisgloves.   Mr. King agrees: &quot;They said I'm a scalawag, a thief, arapscallion, yet I continue to survive.&quot;   ---             Heavyweight Slugfest in Court                     Who Gets What                                                                                                          Revenue from championship bouts is split differently ateach fight; a typical fight might break down this way:                                                                                                          Split by two promoters              35%   Host                                31%   Champion                            20%   Challenger                          14%</TEXT></DOC>
