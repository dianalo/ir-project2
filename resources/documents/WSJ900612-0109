The law, declared unconstitutional on the same grounds thecourt used to invalidate a Texas statute a year ago, sets upa constitutional debate less than five months before the fallelections. Bucking the polls, the president and theRepublican Party, Democratic leaders in the House and Senateoppose any constitutional amendment on flag desecration.</LP><TEXT>   Even if they prevail legislatively, some Democrats maylose in November because of how they vote on the issue.Republicans hope the flag controversy will revive the party'seffort to paint the Democrats as out of step with mainstreamsocial and cultural views, an argument that has been badlybattered by public opposition to the Supreme Court's abortiondecision last July.   &quot;This is as clear a cultural-value issue as there can be,&quot;says Marc Nuttle, executive director of the NationalRepublican Congressional Committee, the House GOP's campaignarm. &quot;This is one of the value conflicts that allows us tomake a true comparison between parties and candidates. Thisis a real opportunity.&quot;   Those pushing the flag amendment currently have a slightpolitical edge in the battle to obtain the necessarytwo-thirds of each house and then to submit it for approvalby three-quarters of the states.   The two sides have already cast the issue as a struggleover whether to protect the flag or to protect the Bill ofRights. Democrats find themseves on the defensive, with theRepublicans even holding an advantage in stating the issue.House GOP leader Robert Michel of Illinois strode onto thefloor yesterday and declared that &quot;the essential question is:Does the Congress really want to protect the flag fromdesecration?&quot;   The Democratic leadership's position is more complicated.It is preparing to argue that the flag proposal would for thefirst time amend the 200-year-old protections of the Bill ofRights.   Democrats who watched Gov. Michael Dukakis ofMassachusetts struggle with a similar position in the 1988presidential election know how difficult the fight will be.&quot;Opposition to the amendment may be noble, but it may take amiracle to stop it,&quot; says Harvard Law School professorChristopher Edley, who was the issues director for theDukakis campaign. &quot;I know the power of this issue -- and thedangers of a position that takes a long explanation to thepublic.&quot;   Opponents of a constitutional amendment have already trieda quick-fix solution. After the Supreme Court voided theTexas law, Congress quickly passed the law struck downyesterday. The law was passed in part to head off anyamendment.   In its 5-4 vote, the court found that the federal law,like the Texas statute, violated the First Amendment'sguarantee of freedom of speech.   A 20-word proposed constitutional amendment, alreadyintroduced in the House and Senate, says Congress and thestates have the power to pass laws to &quot;prohibit the physicaldesecration of the flag.&quot; The effect would be that the FirstAmendment would no longer protect actions involving the flagfrom state or federal prosecution.   Republican strategists say they are geared up to exploitwhat Wendy DeMocker, spokeswoman for the RepublicanSenatorial Campaign Committee, calls a &quot;very powerful, verypotent, very emotional issue.&quot; The five Democratic senatorsthe Republicans consider most vulnerable this fall -- MaxBaucus of Montana, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Carl Levin ofMichigan, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island and Paul Simon ofIllinois -- all voted against an effort for an amendmentafter the decision in the Texas case.   One Republican mulling use of the issue is Mr. Simon'sopponent, Rep. Lynn Martin. &quot;On a system of values thatmatter, here is one of the places we differ,&quot; she says. &quot;Iwon't call him names, but I think he is out of touch.&quot;   Celinda Lake, a Democratic political consultant, says thebest response Democratic candidates can make to such chargesis &quot;to say they love the country and the flag. People know nopolitician is for burning the flag.&quot;   Democratic Sen. Robert Kerrey of Nebraska, who won theCongressional Medal of Honor in Vietnam, cast the issue interms of the changes sweeping the former Communist bloc: &quot;Idon't see how we can make repeated trips to Eastern Europe,talking about freedom and the right to dissent . . . and notonce saying that when you put together your constitution,make sure you protect your flag.&quot;   Some Republicans argue against embracing the flagcampaign. &quot;This is truly the vilest of cheap issues,&quot; saysJohn Buckley, a GOP political consultant. &quot;Democrats who geton the wrong side of this may face political oblivion, butRepublicans who exploit it ought to face intellectual hell.&quot;   Adds conservative Republican Sen. Gordon Humphrey of NewHampshire: &quot;The Bill of Rights is a list of things that thegovernment may not do, and one of those is to limit speech. Idon't want it diluted for any purpose.&quot;   President Bush indicated his determination to &quot;continue topress for what I strongly believe is in the public interest&quot;-- a constitutional amendment.   Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole even urged a floor voteThursday, Flag Day. In political terms, Mr. Dole said, theissue would &quot;make a good 30-second spot.&quot; Asked whether alawmaker could easily defend opposition to the amendment, hesaid: &quot;I think he could at a bar association meeting, but notbefore real people.&quot;   Democratic Rep. Robert Kastenmeier of Wisconsin, a memberof the House Judiciary Committee and an opponent of theamendment, says, &quot;I don't think at the moment that there isone-third-plus-one members of the House to defeat theamendment.&quot;   In striking down the federal law, the Supreme Courtdivided as it did in the Texas case. Justice William Brennanwrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices ThurgoodMarshall, Harry Blackmun, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy.Justice John Stevens dissented, joined by Chief JusticeWilliam Rehnquist and Justices Byron White and SandraO'Connor.   Many constitutional-law experts had expected the outcome.&quot;Congress had made clear that the law was not designed toprotect the (physical) integrity of the flag, but rather tosuppress unpatriotic treatment of the flag,&quot; said Harvard LawSchool Prof. Laurence Tribe. The eight-page decision --issued less than a month after the case was argued -- and thesix-page dissent contained none of the emotional rhetoricthat marked the Texas-case ruling.   The House Judiciary Committee will consider the amendmentnext Tuesday, with a vote on the floor coming as soon as aweek later. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden(D., Del.), who has said he plans to draft his ownconstitutional amendment, is embarking on a slower schedulethat will include hearings &quot;to determine how to best fashionan amendment that doesn't do violence&quot; to the Bill of Rights.Senate leaders haven't agreed on a timetable for flooraction.   The Democratic leaders are committed to allowing a vote onan amendment despite their own opposition; they believe itwould be even more damaging to avoid the issue.   Some strategists argue that the political risk of theissue is overstated. &quot;I can't imagine that it will make acritical difference in elections,&quot; says Harrison Hickman, aDemocratic pollster and consultant. &quot;The public has chewedthis around pretty good. It might stimulate some voterturnout, but I don't think you'll see people charging out tooust an incumbent just because of this.&quot;   Lawmakers already had a chance to show their support forthe flag by voting on a resolution to condemn the SupremeCourt's original flag-burning decision and by voting for thestatute that the court struck down yesterday. The two earliervotes may provide some Democrats with enough political coverto support the leadership on the amendment.   Democratic Rep. Don Edwards of California, one of the mostardent opponents of the amendment, says political riskremains. &quot;If that risk weren't there,&quot; he says, &quot;themembership would overwhelmingly vote to preserve theConstitution.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
