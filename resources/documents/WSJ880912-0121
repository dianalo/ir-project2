Miller </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><TEXT>   Suppose you are writing a historical novel set in 14th-century England. Your hero is an earthy innkeeper whose speech is studded with guttural 14th-century interjections. You want to know just what people were interjecting back then.    What they were interjecting was: &quot;wellaway!&quot; &quot;swith!&quot; &quot;perfay!&quot; &quot;prut!&quot; &quot;oho!&quot; and &quot;goder-heal!&quot; Also: &quot;avoy!&quot; &quot;ow!&quot; &quot;gramercy!&quot; &quot;hosanna!&quot; &quot;benedicite!&quot; &quot;harrow!&quot; &quot;hoot!&quot; &quot;heave ho!&quot; and &quot;tehee!&quot;    Now suppose you are a scholar tracing the influence of Australian Aborigines on world cultures. You want to know all the English words borrowed from the Aborigine tongue.    For starters, there's &quot;boomerang&quot; and &quot;warrigal.&quot; And there's &quot;waddy,&quot; &quot;quandong,&quot; &quot;humpy,&quot; &quot;yabber,&quot; &quot;gibber,&quot; &quot;quoll,&quot; &quot;teraglin&quot; and &quot;paddymelon&quot; (a small brush kangaroo).    For years, this information was lost in the vast inner regions of the Oxford English Dictionary, 12 volumes of exhaustive definitions and etymologies, and eight centuries of illustrative quotations. You could pursue research queries like these two, but only by scanning all 415,000 words listed in the OED, which probably would leave you yabbering like a paddymelon.    This summer a saner alternative appeared. Oxford University Press has crammed the entire OED onto an electronic compact disk that looks like the CDs record stores sell. It took 120 people 18 months to type the dictionary into a computer, but wordsmiths everywhere will marvel at the way they have transformed the English language's richest sourcebook.    The electronic OED lets you search for every occurrence of a word or phrase, in several different ways. You can search through the definitions, the etymology notes or the labels, which are the parts of the entries that say &quot;noun,&quot; &quot;not in decent use,&quot; &quot;American university slang&quot; and the like. You also can look through the quotations, and their authors, sources and dates. And you can search several indexes at a time. For example: all interjections cited in quotations from the year 1300.    The new version costs $950, about five times more than the popular two-volumes-and-a-magnifying-glass version of the dictionary. It runs on a personal computer hooked up to a disk reader, which costs about $700 and is starting to become a widespread device as more references appear on CDs.    Rummaging through the OED on CD is like exploring a dusty warehouse of treasures that has just been mapped and catalogued for the first time. All sorts of whimsical and enlightening surprises lurk inside it.    Julia Swannell, a lexicographer on the dictionary's staff, sat down with the new version and perused it for quotations from historic cookbooks, a special interest of hers. She asked for all the entries from the 18th-century cookbook author Elizabeth Raffald. &quot;I got a lot of what you'd sort of expect: 'apple,' 'bake,' 'boil' . . .&quot; she says. &quot;The one that sort of caught my eye was 'hedgehog.'&quot;    The quotation turned out to be more innocent than Ms. Swannell surmised: &quot;Blanch a few Jordan almonds . . . stick them round the edge of the rolls slantways . . . pour the soup upon the roll . . . some French cooks give this soup the name of hedge-hog soup.&quot;    Another OED editor, Edmund Weiner, demonstrated the compact disk at a recent conference in Pisa, Italy, on computational lexicography. He came up with a colorful list by asking for all verbs with etymologies that involve back-formation, a linguistic term for words invented on the erroneous assumption that they are the ancestors or root forms of longer words that already exist. The list included &quot;burgle,&quot; &quot;misnome,&quot; &quot;enthuse,&quot; &quot;jeopard,&quot; &quot;pettifog,&quot; &quot;locomote,&quot; &quot;edit&quot; and &quot;butch&quot; (what a butcher does).    On a whim, Mr. Weiner also asked for quotations that mentioned both Oxford and Pisa. The computer spat out a quotation from an 1887 history text cited under &quot;fratry&quot;: &quot;Agnellus of Pisa . . . built a school in the Fratry of Oxford.&quot;    I booted up the electronic OED and asked for quotations from the year 1776 that use the word &quot;American.&quot; In a few seconds, my screen flashed the entry for &quot;constantly,&quot; illustrated by an observation by Adam Smith: &quot;In our American colonies the plantations have constantly followed the sea-coast.&quot;    In the entry for &quot;Yankee,&quot; I came upon a definition labeled &quot;Stock Exchange slang&quot;: an American stock or security. Seeking other words with this label, I found &quot;hammer,&quot; &quot;peg,&quot; &quot;pippy&quot; (unstable), &quot;mummy&quot; (an Egyptian security), &quot;duck&quot; (a defaulter) and &quot;waddle&quot; (what a duck does).    Among my other discoveries: an English word that derives from the Etruscan language (&quot;mantissa&quot;), two words that are defined as &quot;h-shaped&quot; (&quot;pterion&quot; and &quot;zygal&quot;) and 400 words described as &quot;echoic,&quot; or imitative of a natural sound (churr, gurgle, flicflac, hub a dub, frizz, fum, giggle, dunkadoo, gloffer, grumph . . .)    This CD contains the first edition of the OED, which stopped gathering quotations in 1927. (If you're curious which authors made it into the dictionary during that last year, there were just 13, including Agatha Christie, illustrating the reflexive form of the verb &quot;to worm&quot;: &quot;I crawled cautiously out of the bushes, and inch by inch . . . I wormed myself down the steep path.&quot;) The Oxford lexicographers are adding later editions of the OED to the disk, using an electronic editing program called Oxford English Dictionary Integration Proofing and Updating System, or Oedipus.    For now, the disk highlights the many quirks and whimsies of the dictionary's earliest compilers. They saw fit to label two words &quot;not in decent use&quot; -- both of which are still too smutty to be printed in this newspaper. The editors also included one piece of biscuit-making terminology (&quot;dock&quot;); two terms of teratology, the study of monsters (&quot;monocephalus&quot; and &quot;phocomele&quot;); and one piece of American university slang: &quot;towny.&quot;    The CD's laser eye also can spot revealing lessons about the history of printed English. It can do a quick count and tell you that there are seven quotations in the OED from 1171, six from 1172, seven from 1173, seven from 1174 and 3,069 from 1175. A lot of the 1175 quotations come from a source identified as &quot;Lamb. Hom.&quot;    &quot;Ah yes, the Lambeth Homilies,&quot; says Mr. Weiner. &quot;It's quite a big religious text.&quot; It came out during the period between Old English and Middle English when not much else was being published, he explains. &quot;It's one of the most important sources in that sort of barren bit.&quot;    There are no quotations on the disk from The Wall Street Journal, though Mr. Weiner says later editions of the OED have hundreds. But there are four citations that mention Wall Street. You could look it up under &quot;operator,&quot; &quot;Yankee,&quot; &quot;water&quot; and &quot;nerve,&quot; as in &quot;the great nerve centre of all American business.&quot;    ---   Mr. Miller is a reporter in the Journal's New York bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
