The agreement _ signed by presidents Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua,Jose Azcona of Honduras, Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador, OscarArias of Costa Rica and Cerezo _ also calls for a cease-fire in ElSalvador.   It sets no timetable, however, for an end to the Salvadoranfighting between the government and leftist guerrillas of theFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front.   ``The accord asks the international community for support,''said Azcona, reading a communique at the end of the three-daysummit.   In Mexico City, where he met with Mexican officials, U.S.Secretary of State James A. Baker III said he could not commentbecause he had not seen a text of the pact.   The agreement calls for the United Nations and the Organizationof American States to set up a verification commission within 30days to plan and monitor the demobilization and help avoid anyborder incidents.   The plan then sets a 90-day timetable for the demobilization andresettlement in Nicaragua of the Contras, who would surrender theirarms to a force made up of Spanish, West German and Canadiantroops, Azcona said.   The 120-day period begins Monday and would be up Dec. 5. Thepresidents agreed to meet again after Dec. 5 to review progress.   Central American agreements on deadlines have a history ofslippage. When the presidents met in February, they set a 90-daydeadline to make final the plans for the Contras' removal. Thedeadline was hardly noticed when it expired in May.   Plans now call for resettling elsewhere the 11,000 Contras and12,000 dependents living in Honduras along the Nicaraguan border.The Contras have been fighting the leftist Sandinistas since 1981,saying they betrayed the goals of the revolution that oustedPresident Anastasio Somoza in July 1979.   Fighting has been reduced to sporadic clashes since last year,when the United States cut off military aid. The Nicaraguangovernment says 50,000 people have been killed the conflict.   If Central American nations stick to their plan to dismantle theContras, the rebels would face huge obstacles in remaining asignificant force. Most of their supplies come from the UnitedStates, the bulk entering by truck over a single dirt road thatwinds 60 rough miles from the nearest paved highway.   ``This is a very difficult situation for the Nicaraguan people.We have been fighting for ten years to achieve peace and democracyfor our country and now we feel abandoned,'' Contra advisor AzucenaFerrey said in Miami.   Ortega's government has set elections for next February. Thedomestic opposition has agreed to a call for disbanding the Contrasin return for democratic reforms.   The summit communique asked the Nicaraguan Resistance to acceptthe plan, although Adolfo Calero, a leader of the Resistance'spolitical directorate, said Monday the Contras would not disarmuntil free elections were held in Nicaragua _ a position the UnitedStates has supported.   ``We're ready to exchange arms for democracy, but not forpromises,'' said Calero in a speech in Madison, Ala., shortlybefore the accord was signed.   `I expect the United States government to give total support tothis agreement,'' said Ortega after the signing. He said U.S. fundsnow being spent on aid to the Contras should help pay for thedemobilization.   Baker noted that the Esquipulas agreement, a Central Americanaccord signed two years ago, says any demobilization of theNicaraguan Resistance must be carried out under conditions ofsafety and democracy in Nicaragua and must be voluntary.   ``I don't think the Central American democracies would doanything to change the terms of the agreement that they have putforth,'' Baker said.   Nicaragua and Honduras promised as part of the accord to preventtheir territories from being used to launch attacks on otherstates. And Nicaragua agreed to drop a suit against Honduras in theInternational Court of Justice. The suit accuses Honduras ofallowing the Contras to operate on Honduran soil.   The Sandinista government repeated its promise to implement moredemocracy in Nicaragua. It also promised to negotiate directly withthe Nicaraguan Resistance on how the Contras can be voluntarilyrepatriated and reintegrated in the political process.   Contras who do not want to return to Nicaragua can settleelsewhere, and Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala all promisedthey would accept refugees.   The United States was not mentioned, although presumably someContras would want to settle there.   Earlier Monday, Nicaragua had accused the United States oftrying to scuttle an agreement.   ``The United States is exerting great pressure so no agreementis reached,'' Ortega told reporters. ``They are in direct contactwith all the delegations except Nicaragua.''   Cristiani denied being pressured by the United States.   The presidents agreed in February to dismantle the Nicaraguanrebels, but delayed a decision on the mechanics and timetable untilthis meeting.   Ortega gave the other presidents a letter from the Salvadoranrebels asking their cooperation in negotiating an end to the war.   Cristiani said his government was willing to negotiate with therebels on condition that ``once the talks begin that they not lookfor excuses to break them.''   The U.S. government had four observers at the meeting but theywere meeting delegates outside the talks, not attending thesessions.</TEXT></DOC>
