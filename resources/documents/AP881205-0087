RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today refused to bar policefrom conducting roadside sobriety tests by setting up checkpoints atunannounced locations.   The court, by a 7-2 vote, let stand a ruling from California thatsuch tests for drunken driving do not violate the rights ofmotorists.   Justices William J. Brennan and Byron R. White voted to heararguments in the case. But it takes the votes of at least fourjustices to grant such review.   Police in Anaheim, Calif., arrested a juvenile identified asRichard T. in the early morning hours of New Year's Day 1985. He wascharged with driving under the influence of alcohol.   Richard T. was stopped at a police roadblock set up as part of aholiday season crackdown on drunken driving.   Police announced in advance that the checkpoints would be set uparound the city, but did not advertise their locations.   Police said they smelled alcohol on Richard T.'s breath when theystopped him, and they said he told them he was coming from a party.He then was taken to a second checkpoint where he failed a sobrietytest and was arrested.   A state appeals court ordered the test evidence suppressed. Theappeals court said police may conduct such tests only if there is anemergency, if there is reason to believe in advance that a motoristis intoxicated or if the tests are carried out at fixed locationswhere motorists know they may be tested.   The California Supreme Court last March overturned the appealscourt decision and ruled that the police acted lawfully.   Lawyers for Richard T. said the checkpoints in Anaheim weresimilar to roving police patrols that stop motorists for sobrietytests without reasonable suspicion of drunken driving. The U.S.Supreme Court barred such stops by roving patrols in a 1979 ruling.   California officials said the police conduct in Anaheim did notviolate motorists' privacy rights.   ``Given the serious safety and social problems presented by drunkdrivers and the minimal intrusion to privacy caused by momentarydetention at a sobriety checkpoint ... use of these checkpoints isreasonable,'' the California attorney general's office said.   The case is Richard T. vs. California, 88-318.</TEXT></DOC>
