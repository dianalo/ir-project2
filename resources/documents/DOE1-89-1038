This generalpurpose graphic control system provides an intuitive, powerful, and flexibleperson machine interface to the accelerator systems. The graphics interpretertranslates user generated files which specify the location and type ofsymbol, and displays a live schematic of an accelerator system on a colorgraphics monitor. The system provides both static symbols, which canbe used to generate a schematic, and dynamic symbols which display realtime data and provide control. Experience has shown that this methodof control has many advantages over simple text displays and has theflexibility necessary to be an important tool in accelerator control.</TEXT></DOC>
