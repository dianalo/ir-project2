Majority of these camerasare imported and they are provided with depleted uranium shielding. Becauseof their light weight and covenience of use for field radiography work,more and more such cameras are being put into use. If handled with care,these cameras are distinctly superior to manually operated units in termsof radiation safety, efficiency and radiography workload. However, becauseof the higher source strengths used in these cameras, even a minor errorin the handling could lead to serious radiation incidents. This paperdiscusses the design aspects of the various types of remotely operatedcameras, their built-in safety mechanisms and other operational safetyaspects. Some of the regular maintenance aspects required for the safeuse of these cameras are also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
