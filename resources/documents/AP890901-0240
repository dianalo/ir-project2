Government officials are worried that the heavy debts couldweaken an airline's financial ability to operate safely, theTransportation Department has signaled anew that it will severelyscrutinize any deals relying heavily on debt.   And some analysts warn that the debt burdens piled up in highlyleveraged buyouts of airlines could mean sharply higher air fares,if the airlines pass their higher debt costs directly to passengers.   ``The money's got to come from someplace,'' said Morten Beyer,chairman of Avmark Inc., an aviation consulting firm in Arlington,Va.   In a leveraged buyout, a company is purchased using its ownassets as collateral for financing the loans used in the takeover.That means the loans are repaid either by selling the assets or byusing the company's cash flow.   Critics of such deals say the big debt-servicing requirementscould require LBO companies to cut spending in other areas, and in asevere economic downturn could lead to bankruptcy.   In addition, proposed airline takeovers may offer as collateralsome assets that aren't really in the companies' hands _ such as newjets that have been ordered with little money put down.   ``I think the (airline) deals are extremely aggressive,'' saidChriss Street, an LBO specialist who is a managing director ofSeidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles.   Some experts believe an airline is the wrong kind of company toqualify as a good candidate for a buyout financed with debt.Airlines have heavy capital-spending requirements and must deal withunions in setting labor costs. Furthermore, their business alwayshas been very sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy.   In one of the biggest recent leveraged deals, an investor groupled by Alfred Checchi, which included KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,bought Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc. for $3.65 billion on Aug.4.   That ignited a flurry of airline stock buying, in anticipation ofnew takeovers or mergers involving UAL Corp., AMR Corp., Pan AmCorp., Trans World Airlines Inc., Continental Airlines and others.   United Airlines parent UAL already has received a $6.19 billionbuyout proposal from investor Marvin Davis and said late Friday itwould consider a rival plan from a group led by UAL management andemployees and other offers.   Assistant Transportation Secretary Jeffrey N. Shane said thisweek that the department ``will take active steps in response to thelevels of debt and levels of foreign ownership.''   News accounts of his remarks caused high-flying airline stocks todrop sharply Thursday, although they rebounded on Friday.   Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner previously had writtenletters to airline officials expressing concern about leveragedbuyouts. But Shane told the Wall Street Journal that the agency,which was silent on the NWA buyout, has decided it was time to``send a message'' to the investment community.   In cases of safety issues or if it deems management incompetent,the Transportation Department can revoke a carrier's permission tofly.   A Transportation Department official, who asked not to beidentified, said Friday that the agency is concerned about theimpact of takeovers on airline competition and safety, but notspecifically on fares.   The costs of airline debt also could mean discount fares couldbecome rarer, said consumer attorney James Flug, a partner in theWashington law firm Lobel, Novins, Lamont andamp; Flug.   Transportation officials also have voiced concern about foreignownership.   In addition to KLM, other foreign carriers have been racing tosnap up chunks of major U.S. airlines. British Airways has joinedwith the employee-management bidders for UAL. Scandinavian AirlinesSystem, which already holds 9.9 percent of Continental's parentTexas Air Corp., has been in talks to buy a stake in Continental.   Under U.S. law, foreign investors may not own more than 25percent of a carrier, but the DOT can object to smaller stakes if itbelieves the foreign carrier is trying to exert control.   Shane told the Wall Street Journal that his department isreluctant to approve such foreign purchases, because there still aremany questions about U.S. airlines' access to European markets afterthe Common Market's planned unification in 1992.   He also said the Transportation Department still was reviewingthe NWA purchase and could impose conditions that would preventNWA's new owners from restructuring without department approval.   ``We've been cooperating with them all along,'' said NWAspokesman Bob Gibbons in Minneapolis, referring to the agency'sreview.</TEXT></DOC>
