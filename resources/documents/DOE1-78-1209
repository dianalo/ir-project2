Based on experience fromdynamic research, it is evident that the frequency fl is influenced bythe toughness of the spindle, flange joint and by the actuator mass.By modifying the Rayleigh's coefficient the procedure for fl determinationwas derived. The vibration tests of valves are performed and a theoreticalanalysis of the mounting rigidity is carried out. The influence couldbe as much as 20%. The results of overall dynamic assessment and experimentalresults of valves are summarized.</TEXT></DOC>
