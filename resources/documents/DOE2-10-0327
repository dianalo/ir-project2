In summary: the fixed-target study of charm production at Fermilab---ExperimentE-769---has yielded upwards of 500 million recorded triggers on some10{sup 4} standard computer tapes, far more events than planned and alandmark in online data acquisition at an accelerator. The Fermilab 15-foothydrogen-neon bubble chamber exposure to neutrinos---E-632---has concludedits second and final run yielding interactions from the Tevatron-neutrinospectrum generated by more than 4 {times} 10{sup 17} protons on target.This set of filmed events is unique for its high neutrino energy andis, moreover, augmented by electronic data identifying energetic muonsfrom charged-current processes and by subsets of high-resolution recordingsfrom specialized holographic and conventional cameras. The Soudan-IInucleon decay program has brought significant portions of its centralcalorimeter and its Tufts-manufactured veto shield into operation on-lineand is preparing to enter an extended data-collection period this summer.These experimental accomplishments, each of them as part of an internationalcollaboration, promise us a flow of new and interesting results duringthe coming years. Our small theory sub-group continues its prolific activitiesin several areas of high energy phenomenology. Our progress in each ofthese activities will be described in more detail in the report.</TEXT></DOC>
