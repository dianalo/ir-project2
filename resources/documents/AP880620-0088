(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Firefighters stopped pumping watertoday and began using chemicals on the smoldering shell of aswimming pool chlorine plant that burned for three days, emittingdeadly fumes and keeping 4,600 people out of their homes, officialssaid.   Tests showed no dangerous levels of chlorine fumes around thefour-story Advanced Laboratories plant, fire spokesman GiorgioPlacanico said today. Tablets of chloride, a chlorine compound, hadbeen bursting in small explosions overnight, giving offyellow-green chlorine gas.   A state environmental official said firefighters began dumpingneutralizing chemicals this morning on small hot spots in theremains of the factory.   ``The danger is eased,'' said John J. Higgins of the stateDepartment of Environmental Quality Engineering.   Mayor Richard Neal said today nearly all the 4,600 people stillhomeless probably can return to their homes during the afternoon.Only a few homes and businesses near the fire site will remain offlimits, he said.   Higgins estimated there are 25 to 50 large containers ofchloride and hundreds of smaller ones still in the building.Firefighters will try to remove the containers, he said.   Police said they suspect there were a few break-ins on theperimeter of the evacuated area, but no large-scale looting.   At its peak, the blaze caused a gas cloud two miles long andfour city blocks wide, sending 275 people, including 22firefighters, to hospitals with complaints of skin burns andrespiratory problems. Only two people were hospitalized, and theywere in stable condition today.   The last of three fires was brought under control Sundaymorning, allowing more than 20,000 people to return to homes nearthe pre-Civil War building. But the threat from fumes kept away4,600 people living closest to the plant.   ``They are resigned to the fact that they will be here throughMonday,'' said Therese Theroux, administrator at SpringfieldMunicipal Hospital, where 170 people, including 120 nursing-homeresidents, slept on cots. ``It's obvious they are very distraughtand anxious over this entire thing.''   An elementary school, a high school, two housing projects forthe elderly and the nursing home remained off limits, and anyoneentering the neighborhood was subject to arrest, authorities said.   The fires in this city of 170,000 began Friday morning when rainblew in a factory window and ignited tablets of a highlyconcentrated form of the chloride in a hopper, authorities said.Chloride in diluted form is used to bleach clothes and releasechlorine to kill germs in swimming pools.   Firefighters put out the blaze after 1,800 residents wereevacuated, only to have a second fire start that burned through thenight, ousting 6,000 more residents.   Residents began returning Saturday, but water-soaked barrels ofchloride exploded in midafternoon, throwing two firefightersagainst a wall and triggering the evacuation of an estimated 20,000to 25,000 people within a mile of the plant and several thousand inChicopee to the north.   At one point, flames soared 100 feet in the air, barrels ofpellets exploded at a rate of six a minute and toxic gas drifteddown city streets. Fumes could be smelled in Palmer, 15 miles away.   The core of the fire was a room containing 600 to 800 barrels,each filled with 300 pounds of pellets.   Firefighters, risking re-igniting the pellets, pumped 14,000pounds of water per minute on the plant in an attempt to turn it``into a big swimming pool,'' Placanico said.   ``If allowed to go on, the cloud would have stayed for weeks,''said Fire Chief Raymond Sullivan.   Kevin Kennedy, an aide to the mayor, said the disaster wouldcost Springfield millions of dollars.</TEXT></DOC>
