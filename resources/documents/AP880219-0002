Albert Gore Jr., billing himself as``entirely different'' from his Democratic presidential rivals,tangled with Rep. Richard Gephardt and Gov. Michael DukakisThursday night in a crackling debate that raised the curtain on athree-week campaign for Southern support.   Dukakis and Gephardt fired back, with the Massachusetts governortelling Gore ``you'd better be accurate'' with accusations and theMissouri congressman telling him to check ``your own record first''before making charges of campaign flip-flops.   In one tart exchange, Gephardt said some of Gore's campaignpositions were so conservative that he seemed ``more like Al Haigthan Al Gore.''   Shot back Gore:   ``That line sounds more like Richard Nixon than RichardGephardt.''   Five of the six remaining Democratic presidential contendersparticipated in the two-hour debate on the Southern MethodistUniversity campus. With the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primaryconcluded, the debate marked the opening event in the run-up toSuper Tuesday, the March 8 round of primaries and caucuses _primarily in Southern and border states _ in which nearly a thirdof the Democratic National Convention delegates will be picked.   Bruce Babbitt withdrew from the race earlier Thursday, andIllinois Sen. Paul Simon skipped the debate to campaign elsewhere.   Dukakis, winner of last Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, took adig at Gephardt, first-place finisher in the Iowa caucuses.   ``I think we were all a little surprised when Dick last Saturdaystood up and said he was proud to vote for the Reagan tax bill''after telling Iowans that he did so only as a last resort, he said.   The debate resumed in the back room after the television cameraswere turned off.   Said Gore: ``I think it's fair to lay out the record and lay iton the line.''   Said Gephardt: ``He probably thinks I'm ahead in the South andhe's got to jump-start his campaign to have a chance.''   Much of the on-stage fireworks were initiated by Gore in thetwo-hour confrontation that contained some of the most pointedlanguage of the Democratic race for the White House.   ``I'm not going to sit here and listen to that,'' Dukakis saidafter the Tennessee senator accused him of a willingness to accepta Soviet client state in Nicaragua. ``If you're going to bepresident of the United States you better be accurate.''   Gephardt sat silently when Gore accused him of a long list ofshifts in positions on critical campaign issues, from Reaganomicsto abortion, and said a president has to stand his ground againstpressure, whether from Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev or domesticgroups.   But a few moments later, the Missouri congressman acidly repliedthat he had listened to Gore's ``lecture on consistency,'' adding,``maybe you ought to start looking at your own record first.''   At another point, Gephardt slapped down Gore's decision to skipthe Iowa caucus and minimize his efforts in New Hampshire'sprimary. ``I don't think people vote for political strategies,''said the Missouri congressman.   There were moments of humor during the two hours, such as whenGore declared that Dukakis was a good governor, ``and I think youought to keep right on being governor.''   But there was plenty of political thrust and parry, as well.   Gary Hart said he didn't question Gephardt's motives insupporting a tough trade bill, but added, ``We all know the road tohell is paved with ... good intentions.''   ``I think if Dick's bill ever went into effect it would be acatastrophe, and the first casualty in any trade war would beAmerican workers and farmers.''   Jesse Jackson, like Gore looking to appeal to a naturalconstituency, drew one of the loudest rounds of applause when hesaid the United States is making products that consumers don't wantto buy.   ``How many of you own an MX missile? Not one,'' he said in anow-familiar refrain.   Gore sought to set himself apart as he noted that Democrats havelost four of the last five presidential elections.   ``I'm saying something in this campaign that is entirelydifferent from what these other candidates are saying. This is thetime for a Democratic nominee who is in support not only ofeconomic growth and social justice but also a strong America.''   Gore also was the aggressor from the opening bell.   ``I listen to Mike (Dukakis) talk and it sounds a litledifferent from what he said in Iowa a week ago ... when he impliedit would be all right to have a Soviet client state in CentralAmerica,'' Gore said. ``If the president of the United States saidthat in office it could have catastrophic consequences.''   Dukakis shot back: ``I never ever said that _ please get yourfacts straight.''   As for Gephardt, Gore said the Missouri congressman's toughtrade bill would deal with only a small portion of the nation'strade problem.   He said the leading cause of the nation's trade deficit wasReaganomics ``which Gephardt supported when it was put in.'' WithGephardt's trade bill, he said, ``we will never be able to get thekind of trade surpluses in the next decade that we need.''   Dukakis also addressed the trade issue, saying, ``We've got tomake made in America the international symbol for quality and valueand durability once again.''   The debate was provided to public broadcasting stations andmoderated by Roger Mudd.   The Republican candidates were scheduled to meet in a similardebate Friday night, but Sen. Bob Dole and former televisionevangelist Pat Robertson announced Thursday afternoon that theywould not participate. There was no word from the two remaining GOPcontenders, Vice President George Bush and Rep. Jack Kemp.</TEXT></DOC>
