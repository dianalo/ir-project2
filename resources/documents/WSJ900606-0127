The company plans to announce today that it is forming aJapanese subsidiary and that Canon Inc., Fujitsu Ltd., SonyCorp. and Toshiba Corp. have each taken a 5% stake in theventure. Softbank Corp., a distributor of software andcomputer peripherals in Japan, is taking 26% of the company,leaving Businessland with 54%.</LP><TEXT>   Businessland's entry into Japan is part of its continuingeffort to expand abroad after a decade of rapid growth in theU.S. In 1987, the San Jose, Calif.-based company bought acomputer retailer in the U.K.; this year, it bought one inWest Germany, and it is looking to purchase a dealer inFrance.   Still, the Japanese market presents different problemsfrom Europe, where demand for personal computers is outpacingthat in the U.S. Only a tiny percentage of Japanese usecomputers at work. Moreover, many U.S. retailers fear thatJapanese customs and entrenched local retailers limit theiraccess to Japan's estimated $3 billion market for personalcomputers.   Though the stakes are high, Businessland's Japanesesubsidiary plans to start small, with a capitalization of $20million, a lone Tokyo office and 14 employees (rising to 100by year end).   The caution is wise; selling personal computers in Japancan be perilous for outsiders. In addition to an extensivenetwork of local computer dealers in Japan, there is nosingle standard -- as in the U.S. -- around which virtuallyall hardware and software revolves.   Few other U.S. dealers have tried to crack Japan's toughmarket. Among Businessland's major U.S. rivals, onlyComputerland Inc. has a presence in Japan, but its roughly 30stores are owned and operated by Japanese nationals, whopurchased the operation from Computerland in 1987. Also,Businessland faces competition from Otsuka Shokai, a majorJapanese personal-computer dealer.   David Norman, Businessland's chief executive, believes hewill partly overcome the market's obstacles with help fromthe Japanese partners. The arrangement is &quot;an example ofJapanese companies helping American companies compete intheir marketplace,&quot; he said. &quot;It gives us a lot ofcredibility from the very beginning.&quot;   &quot;I think the opportunity for success for an Americandealer entering Japan is slim and none,&quot; said MichaelShabazian, president and chief operating officer ofIntelligent Electronics Inc., which operates about 900franchise computer dealerships in the U.S. &quot;I think Japanwould be a very difficult market.&quot;   Each of the big electronics concerns, for instance, willsupply Businessland with a variety of their computers,printers and other products to sell. However, Businessland --at least at first -- won't offer some of the bellwetherproducts it sells in the U.S., most notably equipment fromHewlett-Packard Co., Apple Computer Inc. and Compaq ComputerCorp. Businessland will carry products made by InternationalBusiness Machines Co., its biggest sales producer in the U.S.   Mr. Norman said what brands Businessland would carrywasn't a precondition for receiving investments from Canon,Toshiba, Fujitsu and Sony.   Besides gaining a new outlet for their wares, the Japaneseelectronics firms are hoping that Businessland's emphasis ontying together computers and related products from differentmanufacturers will stimulate demand for office-automationequipment.   &quot;The trend in the U.S. and Europe of integrated networkingand end-user computing is now appearing in Japanesecorporations,&quot; said Tadishi Sekizawa, Fujitsu's executivedirector. &quot;Businessland's experience . . . will be veryvaluable to Japanese companies as they experience this changein their computing environment.&quot;   For its part, Businessland hopes the deal will give it aninside track with Japanese corporate buyers of computers.   &quot;Historically, Japanese corporations have invested heavilyin automation to increase productivity in the factory, thenin research and development labs,&quot; Keizo Yamaji, Canon'spresident, said in a statement. &quot;We feel the next bigopportunity will be in the office.&quot;   Businessland at first plans to gain a foothold in Japan bycatering to the numerous foreign multinationals doingbusiness there. But in the long run, it wants to act as aspur toward standardization among personal-computer parts.The lack of standardization limits customer choices asmanufacturers can't agree on common specifications. With fourof Japan's biggest electronics companies -- all majorcomputer and peripheral makers -- joining to backBusinessland, this could change.   &quot;My goal is to convince manufacturers to closely worktogether and help the customer,&quot; said Reizo Harada, presidentof Businessland's Japanese subsidiary, who has worked withU.S. computer makers in Japan for the past 29 years. &quot;If weare successful, we can create momentum for standards here.&quot;   Businessland shares closed at $9, up 50 cents, in New YorkStock Exchange composite trading yesterday.</TEXT></DOC>
