(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker, the television evangelist wholost his PTL empire in a sex scandal, was sentenced to 45 years inprison and fined $500,000 Tuesday for defrauding his followers forhis own enrichment.   ``I'm deeply sorry for those I have hurt,'' Bakker, 49, saidbefore he was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Robert Potter. ``Ihave sinned. But never in my life did I intend to defraud.''   Bakker shook his head in disbelief while a federal prosecutorpresented arguments, as did his daughter, Tammy Sue Chapman.Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye, did not attend the court session.   Potter is nicknamed ``Maximum Bob'' after his reputation forharsh sentences, particularly in drug sentences.   Bakker had faced a maximum sentence of 120 years, but the judgeconsolidated the 24 fraud and conspiracy counts to nine andsentenced Bakker to five years on each. Bakker could be eligiblefor parole in 10 years.   His lawyers said they would appeal, and despite defense pleas,Bakker was immediately taken into custody and driven to themedium-security Federal Correctional Institution at Talladega,Ala., about 60 miles east of Birmingham.   In handing down the sentence, Potter said, ``I'm concerned aboutthe hundreds of letters I have here from people who say they'd doanything for him and that could include preventing Mr. Bakker fromgoing to prison. I believe them.''   Because of that, he said, ``I think we're going to have to puthim into custody.''   At that point, Bakker's daughter broke into sobs.   Bakker was put in a holding cell, then taken away in agovernment sedan to Talladega. He arrived at the prison about 9:30p.m. CDT and was led in handcuffs and shackles to the prisonentrance.   Bakker kept his eyes on the ground and did not comment as he washustled inside surrounded by six guards. A prison official saidBakker would probably be transferred to another prison in one ortwo weeks.   Bakker's attorney, Harold Bender, said his client was ``in asgood spirits as he can be under the circumstances. Of course, he'sconcerned about the lengthy sentence but he has strong faith, andwill come through.''   Bender said he had filed notice of appeal with the 4th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., and would ask the courtto free Bakker on bond.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller said Bakker's sentence``sends a message that you can't use TV and the mails to makefraudulent statements to get people to send money to you. This is asimple fraud case.''   Jessica Hahn, the former church secretary whose sexual trystwith Bakker led to the hush money scandal that caused him to losecontrol of PTL in 1987, said she wasn't satisfied with the sentence.   ``It cannot repay those millions of dollars, and the years ofwork people did to make it, but at least it's a start,'' Hahn saidin a telephone interview with The Associated Press from her WestHollwood, Calif., home. ``At least people can feel like they won'tbe taken for fools.   ``How must they feel?'' she asked. ``The ones who gave millions,the people who took out loans? ''   Bakker supporter Helen Gordon said the sentence was not fair.``Jim Bakker's no crook. The news media made him look like one,''she said.   There was no sign of Mrs. Bakker in Charlotte or at the couple'shome in Orlando, Fla., where the couple established a new churchand television ministry.   Former defense attorney George T. Davis said the sentence was``pretty heavy ... for a white-collar criminal. That's prettystartling.'' Davis, who was interviewed by telephone in Atlantawhile awaiting a flight to his home in Hawaii, said he asked Bakkerto release him from the case before sentencing.   Prosecutors didn't recommend a specific sentence, but askedPotter for a long sentence and a heavy fine, arguing that Bakkerhasn't assumed responsibility for his crimes. The government alsoasked that Bakker be ordered to repay up to $100 million in moneydonated by followers.   Potter did not order Bakker to make restitution, saying thatissue needed to be resolved in bankruptcy court.   Bender, asked Potter to consider alternatives to prison ``andallow this defendant the benefit of the court's compassion andmercy.''   Bakker was convicted Oct. 5 on 23 counts of fraud and one countof conspiracy for selling lodging guarantees at his Christianretreat when he knew there weren't enough rooms available.   The jury, which began hearing the case Aug. 28, found thatBakker used more than $3.7 million of his followers' money to buyluxurious homes, fancy cars, jewelry and expensive vacations.   Those who bought the lodging guarantees, called lifetimepartners, sent him more than $158 million. The partners then weresupposed to be entitled to three nights' lodging each year at thePTL Ministry's Heritage USA retreat at Fort Mill, S.C.   Bakker resigned from the PTL on March 19, 1987, amid a sex andmoney scandal involving Ms. Hahn.   During the trial, which lasted nearly six weeks, defenseattorneys called 75 witnesses, including more than 50 who wereloyal Bakker supporters.   Prosecutors called more than 100 witnesses, including manylifetime partners who had sent money _ usually $1,000.</TEXT></DOC>
