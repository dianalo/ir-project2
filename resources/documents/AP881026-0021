I don't know. It all of a suddenexploded,'' said Howard Braham, director of the National MarineMammal Laboratory in Seattle, the chief U.S. research center onwhales.   ``Only the individual can answer if it's worth it,'' Braham said.``We're dealing with the human spirit. We allow some awfully damningthings to go unchecked and then we reach out to something with atear in our eye.''   The leviathan rescue has thrown together an unlikely army ofwould-be saviors: whale-hunting Eskimos, Greenpeaceenvironmentalists, oil companies, the U.S. and Soviet governments,wildlife experts, animal behavior specialists and chainsawmechanics. An international cast of some 40 to 60 reporters keepsthe world informed of any progress.   The two surviving gray whales imprisoned by the ice are part ofan endangered species, meaning they are thought to be in imminentdanger of becoming extinct.   But the population of grays is flourishing. There are about21,000, which is near the historic peak of 25,000 reached beforewhale hunters slaughtered all but a few thousand around the turn ofthe century.   The Soviets kill 169 gray whales each year to feed Eskimos underan exemption granted by the International Whaling Commission, andanother 1,000 animals die of natural causes yearly, according togovernment estimates.   Despite the losses, the population of grays increases by 2.5percent a year, and the deaths of three wayward whales not yet oldenough to breed would be insignificant, scientists said.   ``There's no loss from a biological standpoint,'' said researchbiologist David Withrow from the National Marine Mammal Laboratory.   But cold facts have no chance against heated emotions when humannature fights Mother Nature.   The whales have names. Biologists call the two survivors Bonnetand Crossbeak. The Inupiat Eskimos who discovered them Oct. 7 callthem Putu and Siku for Ice Hole and Ice. A third whale, Bone orKanik for Snowflake, apparently died Friday.   Television brought the whales into U.S. homes. Nightly picturesof their battered and bleeding snouts protruding from a breathinghole cut like a harpoon into American hearts.   ``These animals are turning out to be ambassadors for all marinelife,'' said Susan Vernon of the Whale Museum in Friday Harbor,Wash. ``I don't think it's overreaction. It's a catharsis. Thehelping hand was extended. And it was extended in good faith.''   Gray whales feed in the icy Arctic Ocean, then migrate 7,000miles to breed off balmy Baja California. The three trapped whaleswere migrating for the first time.   Even experienced bowhead whales, equipped with thick skulls tobreak through ice, get hemmed in. About 10 to 12 of them perish eachyear off northern Alaska, biologists said.   Some have questioned the expense of trying to save the whales _which had reached upward of $600,000 and counting as of Monday _while funding for U.S. whale research has been cut. The annualbudget for the National Marine Mammal Laboratory is $2 million, downfrom $2.8 million in 1985.   ``However much money they're spending on the rescue is fine,''said Patty Warhol, director of the American Cetacean Society in SanPedro, Calif.   ``That money might be better used in research, but you just can'tbuy that kind of public relations for whales,'' she said. ``Today,there are people all over the country talking about whales who twoweeks ago didn't know they existed or thought they were big fish.''   The mercy mission has melted hearts of grizzled oil fieldroustabouts from the bone-chilling North Slope, who also have reapeda public relations harvest of good will for their labors.   VECO Inc. of Prudhoe Bay offered to send a 185-ton icepulverizing hoverbarge to smash a pathway to the sea, with ARCOAlaska Inc. donating fuel to the Alaska National Guard helicopterthat tried vainly to coax it to the whales. The barge got stuck inshallow water.   ``It was a common cause to help the underdog. We're human too,''said Marvin King, operations manager for VECO. ``It's not money.It's not headlines. We wanted to do what we could to help anothermammal.''   ``We did what we should have done,'' said Ben Odom, senior vicepresident of ARCO Alaska. ``It's a sad sight to see them strugglingto stay alive. What's that worth to help them? We're not discouragedby the naysayers.''</TEXT></DOC>
