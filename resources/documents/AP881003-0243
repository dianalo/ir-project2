Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal presented thedocuments certifying Saudi adherence to the treaty at a ceremonyattended by Secretary of State George P. Shultz and United Nationsofficials.   The United States is one of the countries authorized under thetreaty to receive such documents.   U.S. officials said Saudi officials told Shultz earlier thisyear of their intention to subscribe to the treaty, under whichsignatory nations promise not to acquire a nuclear weaponscapability, among other requirements.   The Reagan administration had been somewhat concerned aboutSaudi Arabia's intentions after the monarchy acquired CSS2 missilesfrom China. The Chinese had never exported the weapon previouslyand had equipped its own arsenal with nuclear warheads, accordingto U.S. officials who asked not to be identified.   However, Saudi officials have assured the United States that themissiles they imported from China are not equipped with nuclearwarheads.   Israel has long been concerned about Saudi Arabia's intentionsbecause of the proximity of the two countries. Israel has notsigned the treaty.   `The United States is extremely pleased that Saudi Arabia hasjoined the community of nations embraced by the treaty,'' StateDepartment spokesman Charles Redman said.   He called the accord ``the most widely supported arms controltreaty in history.   ``The broad consensus among mankind that the spread of nuclearweapons is a danger that can and must be avoided,'' Redman said.   ``With its accession to the treaty today, Saudi Arabia isstrengthening the global non-proliferation regime, demonstratingits peaceful intentions in the region.''   Redman expressed hope that all states which have not yet joinedthe treaty will decide to do so.   Shultz spent the day conferring with high-ranking Arabdiplomats, including Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.   Redman said both countries agreed on the importance of expandingrelations after an extended period of acrimony generated by U.S.allgeations that Iraq used chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels.   He said Aziz repeated his Sept. 17 statement in which hepromised to abide by commitments Iraq has undertaken concerningchemical weapons. The Reagan administration has said it interpretsthat statement to mean Iraq forswears the use of such weaponry.   Speaking briefly with reporters after meeting Shultz, Aziz saidthere were ``no complaints'' from the U.S. side about chemicalweapons use.   Iraq denied engaging in chemical warfare against the Kurds butthe Reagan administration said it had evidence to the contrary.   Iraq has acknowledged using chemical weapons against Iran intheir 8-year-old war.</TEXT></DOC>
