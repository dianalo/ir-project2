It has been found that i-Bu{sub2}AlCl adds to olefins under the action of Zr catalysts. The authorsinvestigated the possibility of the hydroalumination of olefins withsterically hindered (2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxy)diisobutylaluminumwith the participation of Zr and Ti catalysts.</TEXT></DOC>
