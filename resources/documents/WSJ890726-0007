The day the computer maker said it would cut some Macintosh prices, its stock tumbled 7.7% as a breathtaking seven million shares changed hands. Less than two weeks later, after Apple forecast lower quarterly earnings, the institutions yanked the stock down another 10% on record-shattering volume of 18.9 million shares.    Although Mr. Shepherd says he likes matching wits with the big boys, he doesn't like Apple's volatility. &quot;When it goes down like that, you lose -- even if you don't sell,&quot; he says. He plans to unload some of his shares soon.    The quirky OTC market, long the arena for fledgling stocks and small investors, is falling to the big-money crowd. Since 1982, institutional investors -- giant insurance companies, mutual funds and pension funds -- have increasingly become the dominant players.    That is evident in figures from the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system, the computerized system that displays market makers' bid prices to buy and offer prices to sell the major OTC stocks. In the first five months of this year, big-block trades -- an indicator of institutional activity -- accounted for 43% of total volume on Nasdaq's National Market System, where its largest stocks are traded. That percentage increased steadily from 1983 to 1988, when it leveled off.    &quot;The OTC market has always been the purview of the man on the street, but now it's the thundering herd that pushes the market higher or lower,&quot; says Binkley Shorts, who runs the $330 million Over-The-Counter Securities Fund. &quot;The OTC stocks the institutions are interested in have greater volatility and are a more dangerous game for individual investors.&quot;    The over-the-counter market also includes some 11,000 small issues known as pink-sheet stocks, after the hue of the pages on which they are quoted. Many of these stocks have low prices, and most are thinly traded. But Nasdaq, with some 4,500 larger OTC stocks, now is the second-largest equity market in the U.S., after the New York Stock Exchange, and the third-largest in the world, after New York and the Tokyo exchange.    Why have the institutions become so enamored of Nasdaq? &quot;Some of the bigger Dow Jones Industrials-type stocks have had big gains and are becoming too pricey for us,&quot; explains Mark Schoeppner, president of Quaker Capital Management, a Pittsburgh firm that invests money for corporate pension and profit-sharing programs. &quot;We end up in Nasdaq searching for other opportunities,&quot; he says.    The institutions arrived in the nick of time, rescuing OTC market makers after individual investors fled after the 1987 stock-market crash. The defection of the little guys was principally responsible for a drop in the average daily volume of Nasdaq trading, which shrank 18% from year-end 1987 to year-end 1988.    Small investors still haven't returned in full force, but the institutions are taking up much of the slack. Daily volume has averaged 133.4 million shares in 1989, up from about 123 million last year, though still short of the 150 million-or-so pace of 1987.    Besides much-needed trading volume, the institutions have brought Nasdaq respectability and liquidity. Richard Bruno, who heads OTC trading at PaineWebber Inc. in New York, says proudly that the prestige attached to institutional trading &quot;has given the biggest Nasdaq stocks visibility&quot; and persuaded many companies to stay in the OTC market rather than move to the exchanges.    But Nasdaq's higher profile with big institutions has spawned some problems. For one thing, securities firms complain that the institutions drive such hard bargains in their buying and selling that the firms' profits are being squeezed.    Far more alarming is the perception that, even in the wake of the crash, the OTC market is increasingly being battered by program trading. This technique -- the rapid, computer-assisted trading of large blocks of stocks, often tied to movements in stock-index futures -- earlier drove individuals from the New York and American stock exchanges. Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York, notes that 30 OTC stocks are in the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index, whose movements routinely trigger program trades.    Many individuals, scared off by the volatility, have retreated to smaller issues, many brokers say. The shift has created, in effect, three OTC markets.    At the bottom are the thousands of small stocks that trade infrequently and gyrate wildly whenever a few shares do change hands. In one day, the stock of SJNB Financial, a California bank holding company, tumbled 20% on volume of only 3,500 shares. Institutions generally avoid such issues.    Somewhere in the middle is a group of companies with market values ranging from $50 million to $300 million. These, the traditional OTC issues, have become the refuge of individual investors and extra-cautious fund managers such as the OTC Fund's Mr. Shorts, who hate being battered by the wide swings of stocks with big institutional followings.    On top are the OTC's glamour stocks, including such billion-dollar issues as Apple, MCI Communications, Liz Claiborne and LIN Broadcasting. They have fallen under the dominance of the institutions, which like the ease with which they can buy and sell huge blocks. Since 1985, the NASD says, institutions' stakes in Nasdaq's largest stocks have jumped to nearly 40% from 30%. Institutional holdings of companies valued at $25 million or less have hardly grown at all.    The big OTC issues remain less volatile than exchange-listed stocks and those in the Sandamp;P 500-stock index, NASD statistics indicate. But many investors and brokers aren't persuaded.    Harry Methner, a retired electronics technician in Denver who has owned shares of Apple since it went public in 1980, recalls other sessions such as the two in January that toppled the stock. Often he would wake up at 3 a.m., wondering after especially volatile days whether to sell. Now he just tightens his seat belt and tries to ignore the bumps. &quot;An individual investor can get whipsawed trying to keep up with them,&quot; he says.    The institutions can be mercurial. In early May they took a shine to Price Co. and pushed the stock's price up 19%, from $40.50 a share to $47.50. But on June 20 Price posted lower-than-expected quarterly results, and their ardor for the cash-and-carry wholesaler wilted. Its stock plunged 14%, with 57% of the volume in blocks of 10,000 shares or more.    James Pappas, an OTC investment adviser in Redding, Conn., notes that institutions get corporate news first. In acting on it, he says, they often trample the little guy.    Some small investors in Applied Biosystems Inc., one of Nasdaq's highflying biotechnology issues, were indeed run over recently. Disappointed institutional investors hastily unloaded their holdings and plunged the stock into a 16% free fall after the Foster City, Calif., analytic-instruments maker forecast only a 15% fourth-quarter earnings increase. Several bewildered shareholders, who hadn't heard the announcement, called the company the next day to ask why the stock had plunged.    In addition to issuing a news release about its earnings forecast, Applied Biosystems had sent its announcement to a wire service for brokerage-firm analysts, a company spokeswoman says, and faxed copies to brokerage houses and institutions that were large holders. In explaining the company's actions, a spokeswoman confirms the individual investors' suspicions. &quot;Institutional investors aren't the only game, but they're the major game in town,&quot; she says. &quot;Therefore, making information and management available to them becomes important to maintaining a fair stock valuation.&quot;    Roger McNamee, the co-manager of T. Rowe Price's New Horizons Fund, contends that some institutions sell quickly because they don't know the full story and won't wait. For them, he says, the motto is: &quot;When in doubt, shoot it.&quot;    That is apparently what knocked down Helen of Troy Corp.'s shares last month. About 90% of the company's hair-care products come from plants in China. As the political protests in Beijing escalated, traders and brokers say, institutional investors, fearing that production would be disrupted, quickly dumped the El Paso, Texas, company's stock. Helen of Troy officials tried to calm them by explaining that the plants are nearly 2,000 miles from Beijing and that the flow of products hadn't been disrupted. But many institutions remained skeptical. The stock slid 26% in three days, on an average daily volume of 960,000 shares -- 10 times normal.    Small investors' complaints about institutional bullying are echoed by OTC market makers. They feel pinched because spreads -- the difference between bid and asked prices, which represent their profit on institutional trades -- have narrowed. Spreads for individual investors average about 23 cents a share, according to NASD figures, while traders say spreads for institutions range from six to 13 cents a share.    At Nashville-based J.C. Bradford andamp; Co. last month, an institutional customer berated an OTC trader for making too much money on a block trade. Lou Todd, the chief equity trader, angrily recalls that the client &quot;said he didn't ever want to see us make more than {about six cents a share} on a trade for him.&quot; Mr. Todd says the brokerage firm's profits are being squeezed by such demands, but he still accepts the business because the institutions represent so much order flow. &quot;It's a quandary,&quot; he says.    Because of the institutions, market making -- maintaining orderly trading by buying and selling shares when imbalances develop -- now is &quot;less profitable and involves more risk&quot; for traders, says A. Cuyler Kline, who heads OTC trading at Atlanta's Robinson-Humphrey Co., a unit of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.    Moreover, Shearson's Mr. DaPuzzo says institutional buyers expect market makers to fill part of their thousand-share orders immediately at the best available price and to negotiate with other market makers for the rest. &quot;That means we've got a lot of capital at risk with the potential of making only about 12 1/2 cents a share and losing anywhere from 25 cents a share to 50 cents,&quot; he says.    The institutions respond that they have an obligation to their investors to hold down trading expenses. &quot;We're not in a position to be crusaders for paying more money,&quot; comments Charles Utoft, who heads fixed-income and equity-trading operations for the giant IDS Financial Services unit of American Express Co.    Data on profits from OTC trading aren't available, but traders and some analysts believe the smaller firms are being squeezed especially hard. Large firms, such as Shearson, Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. and big OTC market maker Herzog, Heine Geduld Inc., commit millions of dollars to market-making every day but can live with the tighter spreads and the increased risk because they handle so much institutional business. &quot;Institutional OTC trading is economically feasible only if you do a lot of it -- you can {afford to} lose on some if you can make a profit on most of it,&quot; Mr. DaPuzzo says.    And with so many small investors still hugging the sidelines, most securities firms rarely turn away institutional business. As Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., notes, &quot;There are a lot of dogs but only a few bones.&quot; @ --- @ Big Stocks and Big Blocks @ Large block volume as a percentage of total volume for the most active Nasdaq stocks; first half of '89 @ BLOCK VOLUME @ Apple Computer Inc. 54.2% @ MCI Communications Corp. 60.2 @ Intel Corp. 59.1 @ Sun Microsystems Inc. 52.7 @ Seagate Technology Inc. 43.2 @ MiniScribe Corp. 45.8 @ Wheelabrator Group Inc. 72.1 @ Tele-Communications Inc. 52.5 @ Liz Claiborne Inc. 54.7 @ Oracle Systems Corp. 49.4 @ Source: NASD </TEXT></DOC>
