(Products)Futurus Corp. (Products).andO;Product:   Right Hand Man II (Personal information management system)(evaluation)Calculus EZ-Fax (Facsimile computer board) (evaluation).andO;Topic:     Facsimile Boards/CardsEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>In its early years, network fax capability has had its share of problems:creating outgoing and distributing incoming fax documents has fallen short oftechnical elegance.andP;  Now more database applications need to include faxsend/receive capabilities as features.andP;  A couple of products from twocompanies have combinedandM;andlsqb;TABULAR DATA OMITTED]andM;to advance the state of the art considerably--and economically.andM;Right Hand Man II (RHM), the e-mail/-groupware product from Futurus Corp.andO;supports EZ-Fax, a network fax system from Calculus.andM;EZ-Fax includes a fax card that installs in a network workstation and turnsit into a nondedicated fax server.andP;  Once the TSR driver software is runningon that station, any station running the driver can create a fax simply byprinting to a designated printer port (like LPT3) using Epson or LaserJetcodes.andP;  The output is captured and transmitted to a remote fax number, eitherautomatically (based on certain tagged character strings you embed in theoutput) or manually (by running the EZF front-end program).andM;With RHM, things get considerably smoother.andP;  You can designate users in RHM'se-mail address directory as &quot;remote&quot; and accessible via the Calculus gateway.andO;Once listed that way, you can fax e-mail messages to one or more remote usersin the same way you would send them to other network stations.andM;An &quot;Incoming Fax&quot; choice on the RHM menu allows you to see what has arrivedviz EZ-Fax and forward items to the appropriate user e-mail boxes.andP;  Messageforwarders may only view the first page of the incoming fax to add someprivacy to the system, although nothing prevents them from forwarding thedocument to themselves to view it fully.andM;Once forwarded, recipients are notified of the arrival of incoming e-mail,and one keystroke from the e-mail list allows recipients to view faxedmessages in graphics mode on their workstations.andP;  Another key sends them tolocal or network printers.andM;Particularly elegant is EZ-Fax's inclusion of a complete LaserJet IIemulation including the S1 font cartridge.andP;  Software faxes actually lookgood.andP;  The emulation is so complete you can even download soft fonts to it asif it were a real printer.andM;But nothing in life is perfect, and the RHM/EZF combo has a few parts youshould know about.andP;  Most troubling, but hopefully cured by the time you readthis, is a major incompatibility with QEMM and 386MAX: it'll cause crasheswhen application using expanded memory are loaded over the resident EZFworkstation or server software if they also use EMS.andM;The work-around is to use a different memory manager; i.e., don't use EMSforeground applications or load the fax software without EMS (which makes itan unacceptably large TSR).andP;  Note that sending faxes via RHM doesn't requireloading the EZ-Fax workstation software.andM;This defect has already persisted far too long.andP;  Despite the company's smalltechnical staff (a company official refused to disclose its size), a bug ofthis severity should never have made it into the product.andM;The other flaws are minor and shouldn't deter you from purchasing theproduct: each workstation gets its own fax phone directory, instead of newnumbers being accessible to all users.andP;  In a fax that's generated via printcapture from an application, you must know the phone number, since you won'thave access to the phone directory.andM;Also, you can't make a voice call then force EZ-Fax to pick up the phone andbegin transmitting or receiving, as is required for the growing number ofliterature request services.andP;  Although RHM notifies the recipient of a faxonce it's forwarded, it doesn't notify anyone of the need to forward a newlyreceived fax.andP;  All of these are easily correctable problems, and willdoubtless be addressed in future versions.andM;EZ-Fax comes in 4800 or 9600 baud, 8-station and unlimited station, with orwithout LaserJet emulation, and with Windows or DOS front-end software.andP;  The8-station version is priced at $499.andM;John Gunther owns Bucks vs Bytes, a consulting firm specializing in databasedesign, networking, and remote technical support.andP;  He can be reached at (914)658-8203 or on Compuserve (73730,3254).andO;</TEXT></DOC>
