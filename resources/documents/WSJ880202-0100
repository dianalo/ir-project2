Sandra Edwards, president of Childesign Inc., says such items as furniture, room furnishings, appliances, tableware and school and day-care equipment often defeat the child's developmental needs, impart unsuitable values, exclude children from the adult world or are simply awkward or unsafe to use.    Childesign is a New York-based nonprofit organization that encourages and supports appropriate design for children through research, publishing and advocacy.    Ms. Edwards cites many examples. A &quot;country cottage&quot; play tent, for instance, is marred by such details as potted plants and windows with rustic shutters. &quot;Instead of being transformed through a child's imagination to a castle, a hut or a spaceship, the tent remains forever that little house,&quot; she says.    A radio resembling a stack of currency labeled &quot;Money Talks&quot; carries a cynical message, she says. &quot;Furthermore, the form doesn't tell a child anything about what a radio is.&quot;    And she bemoans the endless dishes and cups with &quot;duck and bunny&quot; motifs or bright primary colors and simple shapes. &quot;Objects for children should be childlike but not childish,&quot; she observes.    Children's products are often designed without much research because there isn't much available, says Michael Williams, design director of Child Growth andamp; Development Corp., a New York research and design group.    So, says Ms. Edwards, manufacturers tend to rely on &quot;distant recollections of their own childhood&quot; to design an adult notion of what's appropriate. &quot;After all,&quot; she says, &quot;it's adults that do the buying.&quot;    Trying to Make Sense   Of Fuzzy Language   THE WARNING label on a gas water heater said to be sure a certain valve was tight. The customer applied so much force that he damaged a safety device, which leaked and caused an explosion.    John Kreifeldt, professor of engineering design at Tufts University, Medford, Mass., tells that story to illustrate one problem with warnings and instructions. They can't be written in precise technical language. But the result is what psychologists call &quot;fuzzy sets,&quot; language so imprecise it causes confusion.    Mr. Kreifeldt and his students have been experimenting with ways to use murky language to yield a more predictable response. In one experiment, for instance, people were given squeezing devices hooked to a meter that allowed the researchers to measure the force applied. They were told to &quot;squeeze firmly but not too hard.&quot; He says he was surprised at how uniform the pressure was -- even though the instructions were murky.    Although Mr. Kreifeldt's experiments aren't complete, he says, &quot;We're beginning to learn that these fuzzy sets can be used to box people fairly precisely between two extremes.&quot;    Aerodynamic Look   For Racing Bikes   BICYCLE DESIGN is changing as new materials make new shapes feasible. The first new models are intended to improve performance, but more exotic forms are possible.    Until last year, bike frames have always been built pretty much the same way, by welding or brazing tubes into lugs that form the joints. Frames have become lighter in recent years with improved tubing material -- from steel to aluminum to carbon fiber -- but the assembly technique remained the same.    Now that's changing. Last year Cycle Composites Inc., Watsonville, Calif., introduced the Kestrel 4000, a frame that is molded as a single part, except for the front fork. &quot;We decided to treat these carbon-fiber composites like plastic,&quot; says Tom French, who with Bevil Hogg founded the company two years ago. &quot;Our first model is rather conventional-looking, which was a marketing decision, but you could really go wild -- maybe make it look like a surfboard.&quot;    The Kestrel's biggest advantage is aerodynamic. The structural members are shaped like an airfoil, and the cables that shift gears and operate the brakes are routed inside the frame. According to Mr. French, wind-tunnel tests indicate a Kestrel frame has a 30- to 60-second advantage over conventional frames on a standard 40-kilometer racecourse. The Kestrel also resists side-to-side bending better than other carbon frames.    A New Clock   That's Off the Wall   IF MINIMALISM means stripping a design to its bare essentials, the designers of the Real Wall Clock have achieved their goal. The clock, produced by Zelco Industries Inc., Mount Vernon, N.Y., uses the wall itself as the face. The clockwork, including batteries, motor and hands, attaches to an adhesive-backed hanger. A template shows where to stick 12 adhesive-backed dots directly to the wall. The designers were Thomas Bley of Zebra Design and Steven Holt of Blank Studio, both in New York. According to Mr. Holt, &quot;Instead of 'Less is more,' we were aiming for 'Least is most.'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
