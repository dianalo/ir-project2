Robinson, 45, who faces criminal charges in South Carolina, saidSaturday that subcontracting is common in the construction industryand contends he did nothing wrong.   Robinson was arrested last weekend in his hometown ofGreenville, S.C., on charges that he hired someone to attack amurder witness last Dec. 4 in Greenville. The witness, JaniceRosemond, who survived five stab wounds, was to testify inconnection with the 1986 murder of Leroy Barber, a former Robinsonemployee.   The Chicago Tribune reported in Sunday's editions that inseveral instances a company owned by Robinson was awarded contractsaimed at minority firms but then contracted the work to others.   Robinson, reached by telephone Saturday at the Chicago office ofhis Precision Contractors Inc., said: ``We have not been foundwanting by any agency in any investigation.''   Robinson, free on bond, also said he had no reason to harm Ms.Rosemond.   ``She looks at me as if I'm a fatherly figure,'' he said. ``I'veknown her and her mother all their lives.''   He maintained that authorities are after him partly to hurtJackson's bid for president.   Robinson said he last saw Barber when he and Barber got into afight in December 1985, about a month before Barber was killed.   ``He had enough enemies. Anybody could have killed him,''Robinson said.   Robinson also charged that authorities timed his arrest inGreenville ``to make me appear to be the Achilles' heel of Jesse'scampaign.''   He said he has not contacted Jackson recently and has not playedan active role in the campaign. ``My efforts have been strictlythat of a well-wisher,'' he said.   Jackson has declined comment on Robinson's arrest.   Precision Contractors was formed in 1979 by Robinson, who isblack, and Paschen Contractors Inc., a white-owned firm.   The newspaper said state records and interviews show nearlyevery aspect of the work on a granite ramp in Chicago's State ofIllinois Center, awarded to Precision under a state program forminorities, was subcontracted to a white-owned firm, WolverineMarble Co. of Detroit.   In 1979, the Metropolitan Sanitary District found that the workon a $4.3 million minority contract obtained by Robinson-run ApacheElectric Co. and a white-owned firm, Tunnel Electric Co., was doneby Tunnel employees, the newspaper said.   Two years later, the Tribune said, Precision got a $23 millionsanitary district subcontract for work on Deep Tunnel, a giantpollution control project, but farmed virtually all of the work toother firms.   ``All general managers and construction managers contract workout to specialty trades,'' Robinson said. ``We subcontract to otherspecialty contractors, whether they be white, or black or green orblue.   ``If I'm a general contractor who just happens to be black, whycan't I conduct myself like other general contractors who happen tobe white?''   The Tribune said Precision did not get minority businesscontracts from the city of Chicago because city officials concludedin 1980 that the white partners controlled the firm.   But Robinson said the city's conclusion was wrong and Precisionsuccessfully appealed.   ``We are certified now,'' he said.   The newspaper said that in March 1981, Paschen Contractors soldits 2,500 shares of Precision to the company for $3 million.   Frank Paschen, who retained an interest in Precision, sued twoyears later, charging that Robinson had siphoned more than $1.6million from the firm, the Tribune said. The case was settled afterRobinson paid Frank Paschen $1 million, the newspaper said.   Robinson said the charges by Paschen were unsubstantiated and heused the opportunity to buy out Paschen and another former partner.``It was like a divorce,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
