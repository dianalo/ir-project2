Mr. Ozal, who this month granted refuge to at least 60,000 Iraqi Kurds fleeing what they describe as chemical attacks by the Iraqi army, said halting the use of chemical weapons will require the same determination as that leading to nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament agreements.    &quot;The responsibility lies with the superpowers to look into gas or chemical weapons; they are the only ones who can stop it,&quot; Mr. Ozal said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal at his residence here. Noting that such weapons add a new dimension of horror to regional conflicts, he said that &quot;only the big countries&quot; can bring sufficient pressure to stop this.    Looking tired after weeks of campaigning in advance of a referendum later this month, the prime minister obviously is disappointed that Turkey is bearing the refugee burden alone. &quot;There are countries looking at the chemical weapons issue and making it a political issue, but some should come forward for the humanitarian need,&quot; he said.    The prime minister carefully avoided accusing Iraq of chemical warfare, saying Turkey &quot;up to now has not seen concrete evidence of this.&quot; But the Iraqi Kurds who have been given refuge in Turkey's southeastern provinces say chemical attacks that began immediately after the Iran-Iraq cease-fire left thousands dead in their northern Iraqi villages.    Iraq has denied using such weapons, and Mr. Ozal said yesterday he will invite the Red Cross to check thoroughly. He was optimistic, albeit very cautiously, about the prospects for a lasting cease-fire between Iran and Iraq, each of which shares a border with Turkey.    Iraq's stepped-up attacks, whether chemical or artillery, on its Kurds clearly didn't surprise the prime minister. Before the cease-fire announcement, while much of the world prematurely began applauding the end of the Iran-Iraq war, Mr. Ozal feared Iraqi retaliation on its Kurds, some of whom helped Iran in the war.    &quot;Before the exodus began, I felt something would happen when the cease-fire would start,&quot; he said. &quot;I felt we had to approach Iraq to be soft on these people.&quot; He sent a special envoy to Iraq to make the request, he said, &quot;but the answer wasn't positive. They claimed these people are traitors against them.&quot;    When Iraq also asked Turkey to close its mountainous border to Iraqi Kurds, Mr. Ozal declined. Though many here fear accepting the refugees not only will impose severe economic strains but could revive nationalistic sentiments within Turkey's own Kurdish population, Mr. Ozal said Turkey, &quot;as a democracy,&quot; had no choice. Even if economic gains of recent years are lost, he said, &quot;we couldn't do otherwise.&quot;    Iraq now effectively has sealed its own border, preventing more Kurds from crossing into Turkey. But the thousands already here who are temporarily housed in special camps are worrisome enough.    For Turkey alone to accept the refugees permanently, Mr. Ozal estimates the cost at a minimum of $300 million. &quot;No, we can't afford that,&quot; he said. Turkey's unemployment now is about 20%, inflation is about 78% and foreign debt, at $38 billion, is very high.    &quot;The camps probably will be completed in about a week, but they aren't really very important; the issue is what arrangements will be made,&quot; Mr. Ozal said. Shaking his head, he said no other countries yet have offered assistance. &quot;The burden seems on Turkey alone.&quot;    Politically, Mr. Ozal said many within Turkey's National Security Council are very concerned about the entry of the Iraqi Kurds, who have been waging war against Baghdad for years in a search for Kurdish independence. He expects assimilating the refugees, most of whom don't speak Turkish and 20% of whom are skilled fighters, to be difficult.    &quot;The most important thing is what happens in the future,&quot; he said, &quot;and the future is not very far away. We would like to see the West help us a little by accepting some of these people.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
