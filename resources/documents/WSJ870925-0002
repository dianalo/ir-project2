BulkeleyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/25/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LOTS MSFTCOMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   The World Wrestling Federation uses 1-2-3 to decide whether to lease or buy the trucks that carry wrestling rings to arenas. At Travelers Cos., 1-2-3 is used by some 10,000 people to do the insurance concern's budgeting, planning and forecasting. Joseph Winsten, a New Hampshire cattle breeder, uses 1-2-3 to analyze Holstein stock.    The spreadsheet program, made by Cambridge, Mass.-based Lotus Development Corp., has become a ubiquitous symbol of the personal-computer movement, turning an estimated six million users into number-crunching statistics junkies.    Now half a dozen software makers plan to challenge Lotus's dominance. Among them are fast-growing Borland International Inc. in Scotts Valley, Calif., and Novato, Calif.-based Seymour Rubinstein, the developer of Wordstar, which was once the dominant word-processing program. Most significant is that Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft Corp., the only personal-computer software company bigger than Lotus, is expected to announce a new spreadsheet within the next few weeks.    While these companies don't expect to dislodge Lotus quickly, each thinks it has a strategy to grab at least 10% of the market. But most analysts say they are embarked on a quixotic venture. Better-reviewed spreadsheets haven't been able to topple 1-2-3. Even Microsoft's market muscle hasn't made a leader of its aged spreadsheet, Multiplan.    As Jack McGrath, editor of a newsletter for 1-2-3 users, is fond of saying, &quot;For any product to displace 1-2-3, it will have to cure cancer, taste like chocolate and cost $1.&quot;    Like the green paper forms that accountants once labored over, spreadsheet programs let a user record columns of numbers by day or month. But the programs also perform the math on them and can usually graph the results. Best of all, they can rapidly recalculate the effect of changes -- a 2% price rise, say, or a reduced labor force -- on all the totals. By eliminating the drudgery of refiguring every number separately, they have encouraged businesses to look at many different financial strategies -- and have undoubtedly reduced the consumption of erasers.    Since it supplanted Visicalc, the first computerized spreadsheet, back in 1983, 1-2-3 has been the standard of such programs. Gartner Securities Corp. estimates that Lotus currently has a 70% share of the $400 million spreadsheet market.    In addition, 1-2-3 is by many measures one of the most influential pieces of software ever written. In five years, it has sold more than 2 million copies -- almost twice as many as five-year-old Multiplan, the next-best-selling spreadsheet. It has also helped catapult International Business Machines Corp.'s Personal Computer to its position as the industry standard. Michael Maples, IBM's director of software strategy and evaluation, says it exemplifies &quot;the type product that changes the way we think about computers.&quot;    Nevertheless, the new entrants think they see chinks in Lotus's armor. For one thing, Lotus has irritated some customers by largely blocking mail-order distribution of 1-2-3 and by refusing to enable users to copy it easily. Veteran users say 1-2-3 also lacks speed and such features as a provision for linking, say, monthly spreadsheets to obtain annual totals. &quot;There is a lot of dissatisfaction with having just a single source,&quot; says Lawrence Powers, a technical analyst at Travelers.    Almost all the new competitors have designed spreadsheets that will share data with existing 1-2-3 files and even use similar commands, minimizing the need to rewrite those files or extensively retrain users. But to pose a real challenge, the new entrants say, they have to provide more speed and features and better graphics.    For example, Mr. Rubinstein's Surpass -- priced, like 1-2-3, at $495 and marketed by Surpass Software Systems Inc. -- promises speed and the ability to do complex recalculations in the background while the user continues working on the spreadsheet. With 1-2-3, the user has to wait during calculations.    Borland says its Quattro is not only faster than 1-2-3 but, at $195, cheaper as well. Quattro also allows typesetting directly from the program, making for higher-quality reports and charts. Borland has even designed a &quot;soft interface&quot; for it, which enables users to design their own commands.    While Microsoft won't discuss details of its product -- the first IBM PC version of its Excel spreadsheet, which was introduced two years ago for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh -- analysts say it will be easier to use (presumably relying on menus rather than line commands), look better on the screen and print out more attractive reports than 1-2-3 does. However, trade sources say it won't work well on most existing computers without expensive added memory and other enhancements.    Lotus, where 1-2-3 accounted for an estimated 65% of last year's $282.9 million in revenue, isn't standing still in the face of such challenges. &quot;We plan to keep improving the product and building an industry around the product,&quot; says Michael Kolowich, Lotus's vice president, marketing.    Indeed, the company has announced plans for two new versions of 1-2-3 for the IBM PC line and compatible systems. The first, Release 3.0, will go on sale in the first half of 1988 and is designed as an improved version of the current program. Lotus says it will work faster, allow a series of spreadsheets to be linked together, offer improved graphics and filing and make it easy to use a so-called mouse pointing device. Lotus also says users will be allowed to make backup copies. Insiders add that, to hinder Microsoft, the company may make it incompatible with Excel.    Later, Lotus plans to introduce 1-2-3 G, a program Mr. Kolowich says will have everything Excel has and more. He notes that it will take advantage of IBM's planned Presentation Manager program, which will operate on new, more powerful personal computers to show much better graphics. Lotus decided to wait for Presentation Manager, he says, rather than &quot;shoehorn&quot; 1-2-3 G into current systems.    Most analysts say that if Lotus can keep promising such upgrades, it doesn't have to produce the best product. One reason, they explain, is that the vast infrastructure of software gurus, corporate grapevines and friends is likely to continue pushing new buyers toward 1-2-3.    Moreover, a large support industry has grown up around it. Lotus itself publishes a monthly magazine on spreadsheets and is building a subsidiary that will publish information on compact disks for use in 1-2-3 spreadsheets. It also sells software that complements the program, as do other companies. Santa Barbara, Calif.-based, 45-6 World, for example, publishes a 52-page catalog of 1-2-3-related programs. And independent authors have written hundreds of books about using it.    &quot;There is quite an interdependence you develop,&quot; says Abraham Grin, a financial analyst at Polygram Records Inc. in New York. &quot;It's very difficult to shake that.&quot; He adds that he heard Lotus's competitors at a trade show explain why their programs were better, but stopped the sales pitch by asking, &quot;So why don't you sell more than Lotus?&quot;    Another major factor in Lotus's favor is that existing users have so much already invested in learning how to use 1-2-3.    Gloria M. Bamber, a training coordinator in New York City's office of management and budget, says 300 budget analysts share 60 copies of 1-2-3 and have just gotten approval to buy 66 more. &quot;We finally got them to learn how to use one package,&quot; she says. &quot;We're not about to start over.&quot;                           Top Sellers          Unit sales of leading spreadsheet packages                                             Cumulative                              1986         Through 1986    Lotus 1-2-3            750,000            2,000,000    Microsoft Multiplan    275,000            1,200,000    Microsoft Excel        160,000              175,000    VP Planner             100,000              100,000    SuperCalc               65,000              700,000    Source: Dataquest Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
