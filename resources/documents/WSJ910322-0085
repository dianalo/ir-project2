Within the past month, stock offerings totaling more than$1.5 billion have been announced for RJR Nabisco Inc.,Duracell International Inc., First Brands Corp., SafewayInc., Caldor Corp., Ann Taylor Holdings Inc. and AutoZoneInc. All these companies were taken private in LBOs duringthe 1980s buy-out boom.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I think the pipeline is filling up tremendously quickly;everyone is looking at the public-offer possibilities,&quot; saysDaniel S. O'Connell, managing partner of Vestar CapitalPartners Inc., a New York buy-out manager.   &quot;There's a lot {of stock offerings} getting filed, and alot more are likely to come,&quot; says Jack Levy, co-head ofmergers and acquisitions for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.   The public stock offerings, typically for 10% to 20% of acompany's total equity, are often aimed at reducing theleveraged companies' debt by tapping a hot stock market. Andthat market has been surprisingly friendly to some leveragedcompanies, once stock-market pariahs. For example, shares ofTime Warner Inc., which took on heavy debt in a 1989 merger,have risen 58% from their 1990 low.   By offering only a slice of the ownership instead of 100%,the fund mangers keep the option of selling the rest of thecompany at a higher price sometime in the future, either to acorporate buyer or through additional public stock offerings.   Meanwhile, LBO fund managers can also use the successfulofferings to highlight their buy-out prowess by providing amarket barometer of the companies' value. For example,Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., the biggest LBO manager, plansto sell Duracell shares for more than double the amount itpaid when it took the battery maker private in 1988. In amuch smaller offering of car-part retailer AutoZone, KKR willgain returns of more than seven times its cost.   KKR is the most active equity issuer, with four publicstock offerings in the works. And successful stock offeringscould prove helpful in a separate marketing effort in whichKKR is attempting to raise $2 billion for future buy-outsfrom pension funds and other big institutions. So far, KKRhas garnered $1.1 billion.   Stephen Fraidin, a merger lawyer at Fried Frank HarrisShriver andamp; Jacobson, says that at the moment, LBO fundmanagers can get a better price in the stock market for theircompanies than they can from corporate acquirers because manycorporations remain pinched by a shortage of bank loans.   In the current crop of public offerings, fund managersaren't realizing the sort of 30-fold profits that triggeredthe gold-rush days of buy-outs in the mid-1980s. Instead,many of the companies owned by the LBO funds have more thandoubled or tripled in value.   Still, while those profits may not be spectacular, theyare a far cry from the many recent horror stories of defaultsand bankruptcies of some late-1980s buy-outs that piled ontoo much debt.   &quot;We've had a rash of terrible buy-out stories over thepast couple of years,&quot; says Vestar's Mr. O'Connell. &quot;Now allthe good companies that have been quietly plugging away arecoming to the fore.&quot;   The buy-out funds are engaging in what stock traders call&quot;scaling out&quot; of their position by selling stock in bits andpieces. That way, they hedge their bets against bigstock-market moves. If the market later goes up, they get abetter price for the next 15% sale. If the market goes down,they haven't missed the chance to gain a good price for atleast part of their holding.   But some experts warn that the stock market rally maydisappear before all the current offerings are completed.&quot;Everybody is trying to squeeze through the window at thesame time,&quot; says Robert McKeon, chairman of WassersteinPerella Management Partners, a buy-out fund.   Yesterday, in the latest LBO deal, $250 million of stockin First Brands was offered to the public by its owners, ledby Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and CS First Boston Inc.   Mr. Levy of Merrill Lynch believes that even if the stockmarket turns down, buy-out fund managers who have alreadymade the &quot;psychological leap&quot; of deciding to sell stakes incompanies they own may consider 100% sales to other companiesmore favorably.   Some of the KKR offerings, such as RJR and Safeway, aren'tinitial public offerings because some stock is already inpublic hands. In both these cases, the publicly traded stockhas climbed sharply in the past year, reflecting the improvedoutlook for many leveraged companies.   ---                  Buy-Out Stakes for Sale                                                                                                          Public stock offerings of leveraged buy-outs announcedwithin the past month.
