That's partly because the dreamhas gone sour for many of the so-called ``refuseniks'' who reachedthe Promised Land after years of persecution only to find that inIsrael the issues are not always black and white. Further, SovietJews don't always feel welcome in the Jewish state.</TEXT><TEXT/><NOTE>By ALLYN FISHER</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After years of struggle to get out of the SovietUnion, often at the pain of prison or Siberian exile, many former``refuseniks'' have become disillusioned at what they found whenthey reached their Promised Land.   Israel, they have discovered, is beset by a chaotic politicalsystem and deep social divisions between religious and secular Jews.Even more disturbing to some is the harsh repression of thePalestinian uprising that has been going on for more than a yearnow. More than 385 Palestinians have died.   Natan Sharansky, whose 12-year emigration battle made him a heroof Soviet Jewry, has found his loyalties torn between his Jewishpatriotism and his concern for human rights.   Two of his former colleagues in the fight inside the Soviet Union_ Ida Nudel and Yosef Begun _ have been stunned more by the coolreception that many Soviet immigrants receive in Israel.   ``The situation of the immigrants here is so bad. After devoting20 years of my life to this issue, it is very painful for me to facewhat is happening,'' said Nudel, known as the ``Guardian Angel'' forrisking her own life to help other Jews in prison.   These and other activists say that stories about suchdifficulties filtering back home are a major reason why most Jewsleaving the Soviet Union today, under the glasnost policies ofMikhail Gorbachev, are chosing to live someplace besides Israel.   In 1988, Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union hit aneight-year high of 20,082. But only 7 percent came to Israel _ arecord ``dropout'' rate since the emigration struggle began twodecades ago. In those years, about 255,000 Soviet Jews have settledin Israel.   Nudel, whose cause was championed by U.S. Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz and stars like Jane Fonda, typifies the loneliness andisolation experienced by many immigrants.   She arrived in October 1987 after being a ``refusenik'' _ theterm for those refused an exit visa _ for 16 years. She stillsuffers backaches from eight years in exile in Siberia and inBendery, south of Moscow, as punishment for her anti-Soviet activism.   Nudel, 57, is a graying and bespectacled woman who stands4-foot-10. She is single in a family-oriented society. She recentlygave away her pet dog, Pizer, brought all the way from Siberia,after it proved too much for her tiny, three-room apartment. Herpoor understanding of Hebrew makes even watching television a chore.   She spends most of her time at the apartment of her sister, ElanaFridman, occasionally venturing out to try to help fellow immigrantsthrough the maze of Israeli bureaucracy to find jobs and housing.   She says she was torn between conflicting impulses _ the need torebuild her own life and the desire to once again lead a fight forJews from her native land.   ``To be a symbol for a lifetime is too much for any humanbeing,'' Nudel says. ``Physically, I also don't feel very strong,but I feel I cannot rest.''   Mrs. Fridman, who spearheaded the campaign for her sister'srelease, is frustrated that Nudel is no longer treated as a heroine.   ``Everyone understands that people like her made history, thatthese are people who suffered as Jews, but I think that there is notenough admiration shown,'' Mrs. Fridman says. ``This hurts.''   During an interview in her sister's apartment, Nudel sitsuneasily on the sofa, occasionally massaging the side of her weakback. She turns the conversation away from herself to focus on theplight of immigrants in general.   ``I think there is a crisis in the ideology Israel was builtupon,'' she says. ``Today every newcomer is considered a nuisance.We should be considering them a blessing.''   The well-known refuseniks, who receive government stipends or canmake a living writing about their experiences, do not share thepoverty of most Soviet immigrants.   For them, the main problem is dealing with the gap between whatwas a dream and what is the harsh reality of Israel, says YuriStern, a spokesman for the Soviet Jewry Education and InformationCenter.   ``It takes such tremendous effort and concentration to overcomethe fears in the Soviet Union, that to survive you need to pictureIsrael in an idyllic way,'' Stern says. ``Then you come here, yousee that it is a real country, reality, not a dream.''   What the refuseniks and other Soviet immigrants find is thatIsraelis, most of whom are Middle Eastern and not European, havelittle concern for the plight of the new immigrants.   Many native-born Israelis recall their parents' hard times in anew country 40 years ago and speak resentfully of the smallgovernment aid given to newcomers.   ``Israelis say they don't understand why the Russians shout. Theysay, `When we came here back in the 1950s, we lived in tents.' Butthis is a different time, nobody lives in tents anymore,'' saysYosef Begun, 56, the former refusenik who waged a 17-year battle toemigrate.   Begun spent about a decade in and out of jail, discarding hisprofession as a mathematician to help revive the study of Hebrewlanguage and culture in Moscow. He arrived in Israel about a yearago.   Unlike Nudel, Begun has found his niche in Jerusalem's religiouscommunity and basks in his newfound freedom.   ``After the snows of Moscow where people wore gloomy facesbecause there was never enough food, here we are in a blossoming,colorful country,'' the bearded Begun says, seated by a windowoverlooking Jerusalem's old walled city.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
