But at the same time, the panel acted to restrict China'saccess to technology that the country could use to constructmissiles and stockpile chemical weapons. And the committeevoted to deny Iraq, an alleged human-rights violator, theright to buy U.S. weapons and munitions or to seek creditsfrom the U.S. Export-Import Bank and Commodity Credit Corp.</LP><TEXT>   These proposed measures are part of a bill to renew theExport Administration Act for two more years. The bill wassent to the Senate floor by a voice vote. The House alreadyhas approved its own agenda for revising export controls.   The Senate version supports trade liberalization for theEast generally at the pace urged by the administration andendorsed by the U.S. and its allies at a high-level meetingin Paris in the spring. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbachersaid in a letter to the committee that the administrationsupports the bill's basic provisions on Eastern Europe.   The bill, however, departs from stated administrationpolicy in taking a tougher stance on China and in expandingcontrols on exports of missile technology to countriessuspected of having warlike intentions.   The committee also voted 15-6 to adopt an amendment thatwould authorize the Ex-Im Bank to help finance the sale ofU.S. weapons and defense services to members of the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization and Japan.   John Macomber, the bank's chairman, warned the committeeagainst hastily authorizing such a &quot;fundamentalreorientation&quot; of the bank's programs, which have focusedexclusively on financing sales of non-defense products.However, the panel was swayed by pleas by the amendment'ssponsors, Sens. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) and ChristopherBond (R., Mo.), that the U.S. defense industry needs suchhelp to avert further layoffs.   The Export Administration Act, which expires Sept. 30, isthe legal basis for the administration to establish or modifyits policies for controlling the export of so-called dual-usetechnology, or products with both civilian and militaryapplications. While the administration has already taken mostof the steps in the Senate bill, the export act needs to berevised to sanction the changes.   The bill urges the administration to give &quot;most favorabletreatment&quot; to proposed sales of telecommunications equipmentto Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. This provision isintended to avert unreasonable delays in the granting oflicenses for such transactions. The bill also urges speedieraction on those countries' requests to purchase software forcomputer networks.   The bill would require the U.S. to recognize by Dec. 31,1991, a &quot;license-free zone&quot; encompassing the U.S., its alliesand some neutral but cooperating nations. The proposal wouldeffectively free U.S. exporters from the need to apply for alicense to ship any dual-use product to any of those othercountries. The Commerce Department already has lifted mostlicensing requirements for trade with NATO countries, Japanand Australia.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE approved a bill that wouldrenew the Export Administration Act for two years.Yesterday's edition incorrectly identified the committee.
