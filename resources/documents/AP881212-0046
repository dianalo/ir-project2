(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   To shouts of ``hallelujah,'' PTL founderJim Bakker preached for the first time since his fraud andconspiracy indictment and urged followers of his new church toforgive his accusers.   ``They ask us, `Why don't you attack your enemies?''' Bakkersaid, his voice rising. ``The devil wants me to renounce mysalvation and attack, attack, attack. The Bible says `Love yourenemies.'''   ``I'm not going to lift a finger to attack my enemies. I'm notgoing to lift a finger to vindicate me.'' Bakker said. ``That willput cold chills down your enemy's spine.''   During the service for his New Covenant Church, Bakker nevermentioned the 24-count indictment issued last week by a federalgrand jury investigating PTL.   ``I feel a miracle,'' he told 400 worshipers Sunday gathered at aroller skating rink. ``And the harder the devil fights, the biggerthe miracle that's coming.''   Bakker resigned from PTL in March 1987 after admitting to a 1980extramarital sexual encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn.PTL filed for bankruptcy reorganization in June 1987 and acourt-appointed trustee has been trying to sell its assets to paycreditors.   In Fort Mill, S.C., an auction was scheduled for this afternoonof PTL's 2,200-acre property, which includes a 500-room hotel, atheme park, television studio and a 2,000-seat church.   The only certain bidder, Toronto businessman Stephen Mernick, haslet it be known he intends to offer a total of less than $70 millioncash. A month ago, he said he would pay $115 million, $50 million ofit cash.   During Sunday's service, Bakker talked about his reaction tobeing fingerprinted and having his mugshot taken at the federalcourthouse in Charlotte.   ``I looked up at all those wanted posters and I thought, `No oneis smiling _ so I smiled,''' Bakker said. ``If I'm going to be onthe walls of post offices, I'm going to smile.''   Bakker said he and his wife, Tammy, plan to tape severaltelevision specials at their home south of Charlotte.   ``The old adrenalin is flowing again,'' he said. ``We're excitedto be able to minister to the people again.''   Mrs. Bakker joined her husband on stage, singing ``This Too ShallPass,'' and telling stories of well-wishers who had greeted her inrestaurants and shopping malls.   Bakker won repeated cries of ``hallelujah'' and ``you got thatright'' from worshipers seated under the fluorescent lights andmirrored balls of the rink. At one point, most of them left theirmetal chairs to gather around him and raise their hands in prayer.   As one elderly woman left the service, she told reporters, ``Theworse they do Jim, the more we're going to love him.''   Bakker did not allow reporters inside the building. Some of hisremarks, however, could be heard through the door in the lobby.   Bakker and three of his former associates were indicted a weekago today after a 16-month federal grand jury investigation into thePTL television ministry. Bakker, 48, and Richard Dortch, 57, hisformer top deputy at PTL, were accused of diverting more than $4million of PTL money to support their ``lavish and extravagant''lifestyles.</TEXT></DOC>
