Black andamp; Decker's announcement Tuesday that it would drop itsmonths-long pursuit of American Standard followed a bizarre turn ofevents that halted trading in the company's stock for several hoursfor no apparent reason.   American Standard agreed last week to a $78 a share leveragedbuyout led by the investment firm Kelso andamp; Co., thwarting the rival$77 a share, $2.4 billion bid from Black andamp; Decker.   Under the agreement reached Tuesday with American Standard, theTowson-based tool and appliance manufacturer withdrew its hostiletender offer and agreed not to purchase American Standard stockuntil Kelso had an opportunity to pursue the leveragd buyout.   Kelso will pay Black andamp; Decker $25 million for withdrawing itsbid, and Black andamp; Decker reserved the right to mount anothertakeover of American Standard if Kelso terminated its offer orfailed to acquire shares by May 2.   ``Seventy-seven (dollars) was our top price,'' said BarbaraLucas, a Black andamp; Decker spokeswoman. Ms. Lucas also said Black andamp;Decker initially had thought Kelso would be unable to finance itsproposal, but tht apparently was not the case.   An American Standard spokeswoman said the company had no commenton the agreement.   Earlier Tuesday, the New York Stock Exchange halted trading inBlack andamp; Decker and American Standard shares for three hours inanticipation of an announcement by Black andamp; Decker that nevermaterialized.   NYSE Vice President Richard Torrenzano said Black andamp; Decker``initiated a call'' to the exchange and ``shared with usinformation concerning the American Standard bid which materiallycould affect the price of their stock.''   But after trading was halted at 10:46 a.m. EST, severalconversations took place between Black andamp; Decker and exchangeofficials before it was determined that no announcement wasforthcoming.   The exchange also conferred with American Standard, ``whoadvised us that it knows of no reason why trading in its stockshould not resume,'' Torrenzano said. The exchange resumed tradingtrading in both stocks at 1:43 p.m. EST.   The stock exchange most often halts trading when announcementsthat could affect a company's stock price are anticipated.Typically, however, trading is only suspended for about 30 minuteswhile news is being disseminated, Torrenzano said.   It was unclear immediately whether the unusual turn of eventswould provoke an investigation by market regulators such as theSecurities and Exchange Commission.   On the day, American Standard shares dipped 12{ cents to $76.62{per share on the NYSE. Black andamp; Decker rose 37{ cents to $20 a share.   Black andamp; Decker made its initial offer of $56 a share in lateJanuary, and sweetened it several times in response to rejectionsby American Standard.   American Standard, a New York-based plumbing and airconditioning equipment maker, several weeks ago proposed adefensive recapitalization aimed at making the company a moreexpensive takeover target by loading it up with new debt.   Wall Street analyst Cornelius V. Sewell said the buyout led byKelso would leave American Standard with a ``some very heavy debt.''   ``They will presumably have a negative book value,'' saidSewell, of Argus Research Corp. in New York.   Sewell speculated that American Standard was likely to sell itstransportation products division, valued at about $600 million, tohelp pay off buyout costs.</TEXT></DOC>
