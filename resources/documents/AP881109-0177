KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   George Bush finally won the biggest poker gamein American politics, not so much following the gambler's shrewdinstincts as trusting in the luck of the draw.   In 1980, Bush heard Kenny Rogers' hit song, ``The Gambler,''played incessantly on his campaign bus. ``You've got to know when tohold 'em, know when to fold 'em,'' went the refrain.   That May, Bush folded his cards and ended his two-year quest forthe presidency. But a couple of months later, he got lucky again. Hewas tapped as Ronald Reagan's running mate, and spent the next eightyears as vice president.   This year, Bush played his hand according to a carefully scriptedmedia campaign. He bested five Republican primary rivals and thentrounced Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis to claim the jackpot.   ``You get a good bounce in life, and then one event feeds onanother,'' Bush once told a reporter.   George Herbert Walker Bush, the resume candidate: Ivy Leagueeducation at Yale University, decorated Navy combat pilot in WorldWar II, successful Texas oilman, two-term House member from Houston,unsuccessful Senate candidate, ambassador to the United Nations,chairman of the Republican National Committee, director of theCentral Intelligence Agency, vice president, president-elect.   Son of a wealthy two-term senator from Connecticut, grandson ofthe man who donated the Walker Cup to golf, Bush has sought toconceal his Eastern Establishment heritage with humor, occasionalannoyance and some good-ole-boy gestures that don't always ring true.   ``There's a tendency to have you fit into a mold,'' Bushcomplained this year. ``The mold for me is a kind of Ivy Leagueelitist, and I resist it.''   He resisted by climbing behind the wheel of a tractor-trailer inNew Hampshire and announcing that he liked fried pork rinds. ``Thisis the real me,'' he said. ``This is my home turf.''   But try as he might, Bush had a hard time disguising his preppyorigins.   Just before his highly publicized truck ride, Bush loped into acafe and asked the waitress to bring him ``a splash of tea.'' Hedrew hoots when he was defeated in an Iowa GOP straw poll last yearbecause his supporters were ``off at the air show, they were off attheir daughter's coming-out party, or they were off teeing off onthe golf course.''   Although Bush declared he was ``not going to mess up'' hiscampaign against Dukakis, and largely succeeded, he stirredcontroversy when he tapped Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana as his runningmate. But Bush held his cards and rode out the storm over Quayle'smilitary service and academic performance.   Bush was an intensely loyal vice president to Reagan. He made fewwaves, and submerged any political or personal differences theymight have had.   ``He's the dog that doesn't bark,'' said Richard Viguerie, thedirect-mail fund-raiser for conservative causes. Viguerie said in1983 there was little evidence of Bush's impact on White Housepolicy decisions.   Bush insisted he was ``out of the loop'' and played no part inthe Iran-Contra affair last year.   Later, he said he had some misgivings about the arms-for-hostagesdeal with Iran, in which weapons profits were diverted to theNicaraguan Contra rebels. But Bush refused to say precisely whatadvice, if any, he gave the president.   The vice president did not escape criticism so easily when hepraised Ferdinand Marcos at a dinner in Manila, telling therepressive Philippine president before his ouster that ``we loveyour commitment to democracy.''   Bush also created a furor when, during a visit to NATOheadquarters in Brussels, Belgium, he said Soviet tank mechanicscould teach Detroit auto workers a thing or two.   Perhaps the most controversial entry on the lengthy Bush resumeis his one-year hitch as CIA director beginning in 1976, at a timewhen Panama's military ruler, Gen. Manuel Noriega, was on the spyagency's payroll as an informant.   Bush has largely avoided questions about any relationship withNoriega, who was subsequently indicted by two federal grand juriesin connection with his alleged involvement in drug trafficking.   Bush dismisses suggestions that his CIA tenure would be aliability as president.   ``I led something at a very difficult time,'' he says. ``I wentin there when it had been demoralized by the attacks of a bunch oflittle, untutored squirts from Capitol Hill ...   ``And I stood up for the CIA then, and I stand up for it now. Anddefend it. So let the liberals wring their hands and consider it aliability. I consider it a strength.''   Bush campaigned as a Goldwater Republican when he first ran forCongress in 1966. When he sought the presidency in 1980, he shiftedto a more moderate position, referring to Reagan's supply-sideproposals as ``voodoo economics.'' He defends those same policies asvice president.   Bush has provoked enduring suspicion among some conservatives,summed up in a 1980 article in the conservative weekly, Human Events.   ``Bush was not anything close to being a Goldwaterconservative,'' the article said, noting that his ratings by theconservative Americans for Constitutional Action dropped from a``respectable'' 83 to 58 in three years as a congressman.   ``Bush might as well have been in another party,'' the articlesaid.   Bush can joke about his standing among conservatives.   The day in May 1980 when he pulled out of the presidential race,Bush was serving beer, cheese and crackers to campaign reporters inthe living room of his Houston home.   Someone teased him about having a copy of William F. Buckley'sconservative magazine, National Review, on top of a pile on hiscoffee table.   ``Well, that doesn't have to be there any more,'' Bush said, andslipped it to the bottom of the stack.</TEXT></DOC>
