Tokyo's gain marked the sixth consecutive advance in the leading stock index, but equities finished lower in London and Frankfurt.    Tokyo prices were higher almost across the board as dealers, institutional investors and trust funds were all buyers.    The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues, which rose 84.29 points Wednesday to set a post stock market crash high, gained another 245.41 to close at 24675.36. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index rose 18.58 to 2014.82. First section volume was estimated at 750 million shares, up from 700 million a day earlier.    The Nikkei index ended Friday's morning session up 5.47 points after an early bout of profit-taking.    Some traders said statements by Bank of Japan officials Wednesday that a stock market crash is unlikely any time in the near future might have helped investor sentiment. But some dealers said they found the burst of buying enthusiasm surprising and a little worrying. &quot;This is just too much,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;They should be selling this market off a little here.&quot;    Only individual investors were net sellers, possibly anticipating a dip. But some dealers said the individual selling may have been by holders of margin contracts that predate the October crash. If they were settling margin accounts and eliminating the bulge of these contracts, traders said, it would be a healthy sign for the market. Many market participants are concerned that Japan's six-month limit on margin contracts may mean that investors who bought shares on margin before the crash are looking for an opportunity to settle the contracts and cut their losses before they are forced to do this.    Retailers, securities houses and financial issues were among the best-performing sectors. Retailers have been helped by signs of strong growth in Japanese consumer spending. Chain and department stores posted sharp gains. Seiyu gained 290 yen to close at 2,640 ($20.29). Best Denki, a mass retailer of consumer electrical goods, rose 80 to 1,990. Among department stores, Isetan gained 70 to 1,490, while Sogo gained 30 to 962.    Among securities firms, Nikko Securities gained 60 to 1,820, while Daiwa surged 130 to 2,420.    Japan Air Lines declined 100 to 14,100.    Sony, after posting improved earnings, rose 50 to 4,800.    London share prices eased to near the day's low after a weak early trend on Wall Street compounded earlier worries about inflationary pressure on the U.K. economy.    The Financial Times 30-share index closed off 7.0 points at 1389.4. Volume was a moderate 411.3 million shares, up from 374.9 million a day earlier. The 100-share index was down 12.0 at 1736.1.    The market was depressed during the morning by the release of economic data that revived worries of a further increase in U.K. base lending rates. Concern was cited about January's rise in bank lending, up #5.5 billion ($9.64 billion) -- higher than expected but less than rumored earlier -- compared with a rise of #4.9 billion in December.    Fears of overheating also were raised by news that the underlying annual rate of increase in average earnings in Britain rose to 8 1/2% in December from 8 1/4% in November.    After falling briefly, the market recovered during the afternoon because selling pressure didn't materialize, dealers said. And economists argued the bank lending and average earnings figures were distorted by seasonal factors, such as large corporate borrowing and the payment of Christmas bonuses.    Major stocks ended mixed, with a majority in the 100-share index showing losses. Among widely traded stocks, Imperial Chemical Industries fell 11 pence to #10.61 ($18.60), Glaxo Holdings fell 10 pence to #10.19 and General Electric Co. of the U.K. was unchanged at 152 pence.    Plessey rose 5 to 152 in active trading after reporting quarterly pretax profit fell, in line with expectations, and predicting record results for the current period.    Midland Bank fell 10 to 398, after posting a pretax loss for 1987, compared with year-earlier pretax profit.    In Frankfurt, share prices ended lower, pressured by mild profit-taking.    Dealers said foreign investors were small-scale sellers, while domestic market operators were entering the market sporadically, taking profits from the gains the market had run up recently. Dealers said profit-taking might continue to push the market down for a few more days.    Traders said the easing dollar also was contributing to the market drop.    Stocks of auto makers, dependent on dollar-denominated exports, reacted most strongly to the dollar weakness, dealers said. Porsche and Volkswagen fell 4 marks each to 425 ($249.65) and 235, respectively.    Daimler-Benz declined 7 to 657.50; it said its 1987 earnings were little changed from a year earlier, within market expectations.    Among electricals, Siemens fell 5 to 377 and AEG eased 3.50 to 213.    In the chemicals sector, BASF was down 3 at 231.70, Bayer eased 2 to 254 and Hoechst was down 2 to 248.    Among gainers, machinery maker Linde rose 10 to 580, and utility concern Veba was up 3.50 to 248.    Stocks closed lower in Stockholm; were mixed in Zurich, Brussels and Amsterdam; and finished higher in Paris and Milan.    In Stockholm, profit takers ignored lower domestic interest rates and focused instead on the market's nearly uninterrupted rise this year. Light profit-taking was reported in Zurich, after recent gains.    Share prices closed higher in Sydney, were mixed in Manila, and lower in Wellington. Markets were closed in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei and Seoul.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                      % This                                  Feb 17    Feb 16    Year    U.S. ......................... 240.1     240.4   +  4.6    Britain ...................... 529.9     525.8   +  2.8    Canada ....................... 348.7     350.1   -  0.6    Japan ....................... 1177.0    1168.3   + 15.1    France ....................... 300.9     296.3   +  4.3    Germany ...................... 164.7     164.6   +  5.2    Hong Kong ................... 1635.7    1635.7   -  0.5    Switzerland .................. 151.9     151.2   +  7.9    Australia .................... 242.2     237.8   -  6.6    World index .................. 423.0     421.3   +  3.7</TEXT></DOC>
