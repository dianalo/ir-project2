Mr. Wood said in an interview that &quot;operating resultsimproved dramatically&quot; but that costs of supportingartificial-heart development work reduced net. For thequarter, Thermedics expects to report net of about $230,000,or one cent a share, down from $697,000, or four cents ashare. Revenue rose 20% to about $8.6 million from $7.1million.</LP><TEXT>   Thermedics makes polymers used in medicine and disposablemedical products. But its resources are focused largely onexpanding sales of its electronic devices that detect bombsand drugs and the development of ventricular-assist devicesfor heart patients by its 50%-owned Thermo Cardiosystems Inc.subsidiary.   This year, sales of the detection devices are expected topick up, but Thermo Cardiosystems' expenses are likely torise. Thermo expects to apply to the Food and DrugAdministration by the end of March for marketing approval forits pneumatic ventricular-assist device for heart patients.After years of focusing on research and development, &quot;ourtarget is to become primarily an operating company in 1993,&quot;Mr. Wood said.   For all of 1991, Thermedics estimated that net fell 47% to$1.6 million, or nine cents a share, from $3.1 million, or 17cents a share. Revenue rose 15% to $32.3 million from $28.2million.   Most of Thermedics' net comes from its $85 million incash, mostly raised through stock and bond offerings by bothThermedics and Thermo. In 1991, net interest income amountedto $3.5 million before taxes.   In 1991, Thermedics' bomb-detection business took off. Thecompany sold 56 of the $165,000 detectors, up from 18 theprevious year, and revenue related to the Egis detector morethan doubled to about $11 million. &quot;With a little help from{Iraqi President} Saddam Hussein, we got off to a big start,&quot;said Mr. Wood. He said terrorism fears related to lastwinter's Persian Gulf War against Iraq prompted some airportsand airlines to buy the devices, which can detect plasticexplosives that are invisible to X-rays.   Germany was the biggest market last year, followed bySpain, which is buying more of the devices to combat possibleterrorist attacks on the Barcelona summer Olympics.</TEXT></DOC>
