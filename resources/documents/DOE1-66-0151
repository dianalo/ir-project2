Using a turbulent free jet for the flow rate measurement,average cross-sectional flow rate of the nozzle and Delta-t (data samplinginterval), etc. were changed; possible range of flow rate measurementstrongly depended on Delta-t; comparison with the measurement by a LaserDoppler Velocimeter indicated that the meaurement error got less evenin the range near to the outer-edge of the jet if Delta-t and the filteroperation were improved. This indicates the future possibility of applicationto a two-dimensional flow field, and moreover to a three-dimensionalflow field by using slit beams with different wave-length.
