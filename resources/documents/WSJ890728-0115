As part of the unusually strong enforcement action, the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration posted three &quot;imminent danger&quot; notices at the plant. The notices warned the company and its workers that respirators and other protective equipment must be used, and that proper hygiene and &quot;housekeeping&quot; steps must be taken to prevent asbestos accumulation and employee exposure to asbestos hazards.    Asbestos, a cancer-causing substance, is used in brake linings. Its use in all U.S. manufacturing is to be phased out by 1997.    At a news conference here, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole and other department officials said that Friction Division Products consistently failed to clean up the asbestos pile-up at the plant, despite past OSHA citations and the company's previous agreement to abate the hazards.    &quot;The company has shown itself to be recalcitrant and unwilling to take appropriate actions to correct the serious hazards to its employees' health for which it has been cited repeatedly,&quot; said Alan McMillan, acting chief of OSHA.    Friction Division Products couldn't be reached for comment.    Meanwhile, OSHA standards were a focus of a House subcommittee hearing on allegations that the White House budget office has blocked or seriously diluted many federal regulations.    Some OSHA officials and other witnesses told the House legislation and national security subcommittee, a Government Operations Committee unit, that the Office of Management and Budget has frequently used provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act in a way that undercut their regulatory efforts.    John Martonik, deputy director of health standards for OSHA, said that the OMB used that law in opposing an important OSHA workplace-testing proposal for a pending standard to restrict the use of methylenedianiline. The chemical, used in paints and other products, has been shown to pose cancer and liver-damage dangers, he said.    But the budget office forced OSHA to scrap its plan to require employers to measure the amount of the chemical spewed into the air over eight hours and to have workers tested for liver function as involving undue &quot;paper work&quot; burdens, Mr. Martonik said. </TEXT></DOC>
