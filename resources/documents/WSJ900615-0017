The U.S. government has long alleged that Japanesecompanies are avoiding U.S. taxes by charging theirsubsidiaries too much for certain goods, such assemiconductors and videocassette recorders -- an action thatdepresses the stated profits of the American units.</LP><TEXT>   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. has received a request,and is &quot;cooperating&quot; with the U.S. government, according toan official company statement. The company added, however,that no bilateral standard exists for &quot;transfer prices&quot; andthat the matter was still under discussion between the U.S.and Japanese governments. A spokesman refused to disclose theamount of the tax request, or when it was made.
