The share of Americans who are foreign-born may rise to14.2% in 2040 from 8.6% in 1990 and 4.7% in 1970, accordingto Barry Edmonston and Jeffrey Passel of the nonprofit UrbanInstitute in Washington, D.C. They forecast the totalpopulation to grow to 356 million from 249 million in 1990.   Since the baby boom ended in 1964, birth rates havefallen, and immigration has accounted for a rising share ofpopulation growth. Because more than 80% of immigration tothe U.S. is now from Latin America and Asia, racial andethnic diversity also is on the rise.   The Urban Institute projects that the number ofAsian-Americans may jump fivefold to 35 million by 2040 fromseven million in 1990. Half of that future total may beforeign-born, down from two-thirds of Asian-Americans in1990.   Hispanics may nearly triple in number to 64 million,surpassing blacks as the nation's largest minority sometimein the first decade of the 21st century. About one-third ofHispanics may be foreign-born in 2040, down slightly from 41%in 1990.   The number of blacks in the U.S. could rise to 44 millionin 2040 from 30 million in 1990. Only 9% are projected to beforeign-born, but that would be an increase from 5% in 1990.   The number of American Indians is expected to stay aboutthe same over the next five decades, at two million. Bydefinition, none will be foreign-born.   Non-Hispanic whites will continue to make up the majorityof the U.S. population, but may grow only to 211 million in2040 from 187 million in 1990. With immigration from Europerepresenting a shrinking share of total immigration, theproportion of non-Hispanic whites who are foreign-born willgrow just slightly, to 4% from 3%.                                                                                                          Proportion of Women   In Work Force Drops                                                                                                          WOMEN'S participation rate in the labor force declined in1991, ending three decades of steady increases.   The proportion of women age 16 or older in the work forceeased to 57.3% last year from the record rate of 57.5% in1990, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says. The figure hadclimbed for 30 years, from 38% in 1961 to 43% in 1971 and 52%in 1981.   The work-force participation rates for women in all25-and-over age groups were stable or edged up last year. Buta decline in the rate for women 16 to 24 years old was enoughto cause a drop in the overall figure. The under-25 rate,which peaked in 1987 at 65%, eased one percentage point lastyear to 62%.   In contrast, men's work-force rates have been easing sinceat least the mid-1950s. In 1991, work-force rates for men ofall ages dropped to 75.5% from 76.1% in 1990.   The latest declines for both men and young women canprobably be attributed to the recession. The work forceincludes unemployed people seeking work, but it doesn'tinclude discouraged workers -- those who have given uplooking for a job. This group presumably grows when jobs arehard to find. Though women's work-force participation ratesrose during recessions in the 1970s and 1980s, the years ofuninterrupted growth may have given way to more cyclicalpatterns similar to those for men.                                                                                                          Young and Hispanics   Have Most Mobility                                                                                                          AMERICANS are on the move, but the mobility rate   isn't.   From March 1989 to March 1990, 18% of Americans moved to adifferent home, the Census Bureau reports. That was about thesame as throughout the 1980s, though it represented a declinefrom the 1950s and 1960s, when 20% or more moved every year.   Mobility rates vary by age and ethnicity. People in their20s are most likely to move, according to the Census Bureau.The mobility rate in the 1989-90 period was 36% for peopleages 20 to 24, and 32% for 25-to 29-year-olds.   The rate fell with age, to 20% for those in their 30s, 12%for those in their 40s, 8% for those in their 50s and 6% forthose 60 or older.   Twenty-five percent of Hispanics moved in the latestperiod, compared with 20% of blacks and 17% of whites. That'sin part because a higher-than-average proportion of Hispanicsare in the highly mobile 20-to-29 age group.   Moreover, Hispanics in their 30s and 40s have slightlyabove-average moving rates, at 24% and 16%, respectively.Because these are the ages when many people are raisingchildren, the mobility rate for Hispanics under age 20 isalso higher than average, 24% vs. 18%.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          MIDLAND, Texas, is the most researched city in the U.S.,according to Survey Sampling, Fairfield, Conn., which studiedphone lists purchased by its clients for research in the past12 months. The firm found that Midland residents received alarger number of calls per capita than any other metropolitanarea, followed by Portland, Maine, and Boulder, Colo. . . .Almost two-thirds of Americans shop at a convenience store atleast once a week, a Maritz Marketing Research poll shows.The survey also found that more men than women are regularconvenience-store customers, 71% vs. 56%. And the young aremore avid customers than their elders: 81% of the 18-to-24age group hits such shops at least weekly, and the ratedeclines steadily with age.</TEXT></DOC>
