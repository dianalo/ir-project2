Steinberg, a large retailer and real-estate concern, is seeking bids for the sale of its supermarket chains in Quebec and Ontario, and other assets, including food-wholesaling operations, a meat-processing plant and a chain of convenience stores.    The bids were originally due by Friday. Steinberg said it accepted the delay at the request of McLeod Young Weir Ltd., its investment bankers.    Steinberg decided to sell its food assets and seek a buyer for the rest of the company because of a lawsuit among members of Montreal's Steinberg family who control the company. The suit was dropped recently, but the company said it will still proceed with the planned asset sale. </TEXT></DOC>
