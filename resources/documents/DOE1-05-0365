<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-05-0365 </DOCNO><TEXT>The description of nucleon-nucleus inelastic scattering in terms of single-scatteringhas been very successful at intermediate energies. Nuclear structureis the most dominant feature at low excitations and forward scattering,and the Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation (DWIA) has been the mostuseful technique to extract structure information. The conventional DWIAhas also been applied to quasielastic scattering. However, this methodis very time-consuming at large scattering angles, since many differentexcitations of different multipolarities contribute to the inelasticcross section. It has therefore been useful to develop an approximatetreatment that contains the main physics of quasielastic scattering.In the following the author will try to establish the connection betweenthe DWIA and the much simpler Surface Response Model. The author willgive a short description of the Random Phase Approximation that is usedto calculate the nuclear response, and illustrate the spin-isospin dependenceof the nucleon-nucleon t-matrix interaction, which is used to generatethe excitations of the target nucleus. Finally, some of the applicationsof the surface response model to (p,p'), (p,n) and ({sup 3}H,t) reactionsare reviewed. 19 refs., 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
