(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The crew of the nuclear submarineTennessee successfully launched a Trident 2 missile Wednesday afterthe Navy warned Greenpeace anti-nuclear protesters to stay out ofthe safety zone, the Navy said.   The launch was the second straight successful underseatest-firing of the Navy's newest and deadliest nuclear weapon,keeping it on track for operational deployment next March. Two ofthe first three submarine tests failed explosively.   The Tennessee was cruising submerged in the Atlantic about 50miles offshore when the 44-foot, $26.5 million missile burst out ofa launch tube, broke the surface, ignited and hurled a dummywarhead package to an undisclosed ocean target several thousandmiles away.   The Navy reported several minutes after the 9:15 a.m. launchthat the test was successful.   ``Another great day for the Navy,'' said Vice Admiral Roger F.Bacon, commander of the Atlantic submarine fleet.   A 60-foot Greenpeace ketch, the Mondeivitano, briefly penetratedthe launch safety zone but withdrew after a Navy ship warned it tomove away. As a precaution, six Coast Guard cutters patroled theperimeter of the 5,000-yard safety area around the submarine.   ``They observed the range safety warning,'' said Lt. Cmdr. BillSonntag, a Navy spokesman.   ``We made our point that we have a right to protest ininternational waters,'' said Greenpeace spokeswoman Shannon Fagan.``We will now take our fight to Congress in an effort to have thismissile system canceled. The world can no longer afford the wasteof precious resources on weapons of mass destruction like theTrident 2.''   Greenpeace protesters tried to halt a Trident 2 launch Dec. 4 bysending the 190-foot vessel MV Greenpeace, with 25 aboard, into theTennessee's safety zone.   A Navy ship intercepted the intruding vessel and damaged it byrepeatedly bumping it and using fire hoses to pour water down thesmokestacks, stopping the engines. Navy sailors in swift boatscorraled two Greenpeace high-speed rafts that tried to approach theTennessee, cut their fuel lines and towed them out of the safetyzone.   Greenpeace had halted a Trident 2 test with the same tactics inJuly.   A motor nozzle system, blamed for the two failures of theTrident 2, has been redesigned and the Navy is accelerating thetest schedule, aiming to have the Trident ready for patrols byMarch.   The Tennessee will be the first of 24 subs to go to sea, eachwith 24 of the weapons. The Trident 2 is capable of hurling as manyas 12 nuclear warheads to individual targets more than 4,600 milesaway.</TEXT></DOC>
