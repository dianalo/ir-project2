ThisAct amends the Privacy Act of 1974 to establish procedural safeguards affectingagencies' use of Privacy Act records in performing certain types of computerizedmatching programs. The Act requires agencies to conclude written agreementsspecifying the terms under which matches are to be done. It also providesdue process rights for record subjects to prevent agencies from takingadverse actions unless they have independently verified the results ofa match and given the subject 30 days advance notice. Oversight is accomplishedin a variety of ways: by having agencies (a) publish matching agreements,(b) report matching programs to OMB and Congress; and (c) establish internalboards to approve their matching activity.

L. 100-503, the Computer Matchingand Privacy Protection Act of 1988 was enacted on October 18, 1988. Itwill become effective on July 19, 1989. The Act requires OMB to issue guidanceon interpreting and implementing its provisions no later than the eighthmonth after enactment, or June 19, 1989. On April 19, 1989, OMB published for public comment proposed interpretiveguidance. The notice especially invited comment on the applicability ofthe Act to two examples of matching activity:andbullet; The entering of information received orally into an automateddata base for the purpose of determining eligibility for a Federal benefit;andbullet; The automation by a Federal agency of data from a Federal non-automatedsystem of records. The proposal also solicited examples of routine administrative matchesusing Federal personnel or payroll records that should be excluded fromthe Act's coverage, and matches for which Data Integrity Boards shouldwaive the Act's benefit/cost requirement. At the expiration of the comment period, OMB had received comments from42 respondents. These fell into five categories: andbullet; The Congress (2)andbullet; Federal agencies (24)andbullet; State agencies (14)andbullet; Public Interest Groups (1)andbullet; Public Employee Unions (1)In addition to providing comments on the specific areas requested, mostcommentators also chose to comment more broadly on the guidance. Although the following guidance is published in final form, OMB realizesthat the implementation of this complex Act will undoubtedly require theissuance of additional and clarifying guidance and intends to monitor theagencies implementation closely to that end. <ITAG tagnum="84">Section By Section Analysis </ITAG>Section 5a(1)(a)_Matching Program Definition <ITAG tagnum="81">Caution Against Eluding the Act's Requirements </ITAG>Several commentators advised OMB to explicitly warn agencies, both Federaland State, against engaging in sophistry or subterfuge, to avoid the reachof the Act. They pointed out, for example, that a Federal agency mightcombine two disparate systems of records containing payroll and personnelrecords of Federal employees into a single system and match data sets withinthe new system. This activity would not be covered, although a match betweenthe two separate systems would have been. In other cases, agencies mightconvert automated records to paper records to perform a manual match, albeitone of more limited scope. OMB thinks these recommendations are pertinentand has added cautionary advice to the matching program definition sectionto caution agencies not to engage in activities intended to frustrate thenormal application of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="81">Distinction Between Federal to Federal and Federal to Non-federalMatches </ITAG>OMB, in making a literal interpretation of the statutory definition ofa matching program, distinguished between Federal-to-Federal and Federal-to-non-Federalmatches. In the former case, the necessary components were that there weretwo or more automated systems of records and that the comparison of recordsin these systems was done via a computer. This is essentially the classicdefinition of a matching program that OMB put forth in guidance issuedin 1979 and revised in 1982. It is the definition that the General AccountingOffice has asserted in its study of the costs and benefits of conductingmatching programs: Computer Matching: Assessing its Costs and Benefits,GAO/PEMD-87-2, November 1986. In defining the Federal/non-Federal match, however, OMB read the statuteas applying to both automated and non-automated records so long as thecomparison was done via computer. Several commentators objected to placinga heavier administrative burden on State and local agencies engaged inmatching with Federal agencies than on Federal agencies matching with eachother. One commentator suggested that the OMB reading was in error andthat the modifier ``automated'' could properly and reasonably be read asmodifying all of the data bases involved. Other commentators pointed out that the clear intent of the Act was todeal with situations where large numbers of individuals were subjectedto automated scrutiny with potentially adverse consequences, and that inactual practice, that meant automated comparisons of automated data bases.Certainly the Privacy Act itself contains an expression of Congressionalconcern on precisely this point: that use of computers could ``greatlymagnify the harm'' to an individual.  After careful consideration of these arguments, OMB has revised the definitionto clarify that in both Federal-to-Federal and Federal-to-non-Federal matchingprograms what is involved is the automated comparison of two or more automatedrecord sets, whether systems of records or non-Federal records. In takingthis position, OMB is extremely concerned that agencies not adopt dataexchange practices that deliberately avoid the reach of the Act where compliancewould otherwise be required. The guidance has been revised to cite thisconcern and give examples of such improper practices.<ITAG tagnum="81">State Agencies' Concerns</ITAG>A number of State respondents asserted that matches between the SocialSecurity Administration and State agencies in which SSA merely providedinformation with which to update a benefits file to reflect an across-the-boardcost-of-living allowance change should not be considered a matching programunder the Act. They asserted that the match, if one occurred, was reallydone at SSA, and disclosure to the States of COLA information did not involvea computerized comparison of two independent record sources. OMB is sympatheticto the concerns of the States, but unpersuaded by this analysis. The recordas maintained by the state agency is a State record, not a Federal record.The matching process involves comparing information provided by a Federalsource to that record using a computer to perform the comparison. Thereare potentially adverse consequences for the record subject. Eligibilityfor a Federal benefit program is involved. Clearly, this is a Federal-to-non-Federalmatching program contemplated by the Act.It should be noted that States are free to update their files for across-the-boardcost-of-living adjustments without matching with Federal records. Sincethe COLA percentages are known in advance, are uniform, and are automatic,States can compute these COLA's themselves. Actions taken based on benefitlevels recomputed by the States without the involvement of a Federal systemof records matching program would be subject to the laws and regulationsgoverning such programs rather than the Matching Act.An additional State concern relates to how to conduct the independent verificationrequired by the Act for these kinds of matches. That is discussed below.Entering of Information Received OrallyA final consideration in the definition of what constitutes a matchingprogram for purposes of the Act is the response of the commentators tospecific questions OMB raised in its proposed guidance. Specifically, weasked whether when a State benefits clerk takes information received orallyfrom an applicant and enters it into an automated Federal Privacy Act systemof records the provisions of the Matching Act come into play. A majorityof respondents thought that to the extent that no record existed at theState level, such a query would not be covered. However, if the query produceda record that the State would ultimately maintain, it was covered. Sinceit is unlikely that a State would never memorialize such a query, thisissue is perhaps more academic than real. In any case, the guidance hasbeen amended to add this example.Section 5a(1)(d)_Matching Purpose<ITAG tagnum="81">Elements of Matching Purpose</ITAG>Several commentators found OMB's discussion of the elements of the purposesection less clear than OMB intended. The section has been redrafted.Ultimate PurposeTwo commentators took exception to OMB's assertion that peripheral consequencesof a matching program, even if having an ultimate adverse result, couldbe discounted in determining whether a match was covered. They urged insteadthat OMB broadly construe the purpose section to take in the ultimate purposeof the match (by which OMB assumes they mean any ultimate consequence,whether intended or unintended). OMB is unpersuaded by this rationale.The thrust of the Act is to cover matching programs whose purpose is clearand deliberate and intended to accomplish one of three stated purposes:to determine eligibility for a Federal benefit, compliance with benefitprogram requirements, or to effect recovery of improper payments or delinquentdebts from current or former beneficiaries. The more tenuous the nexusbetween the operation of the program and these purposes is the harder itis to find any applicability of the Act. Having said that, however, OMBremains concerned that agencies not avoid the reach of the Act by disguisingthe real purpose of their matching programs.Section 5a(3)_Exclusions From the Matching Definition<ITAG tagnum="81">Statistical Matches for Research Purposes</ITAG>Two commentators criticized the inclusion of ``pilot matches'' in thisexcluded category. In the past, agencies have done pilot matches usinga small data subset to determine whether it would be productive to performa match of the entire dataset. Given the requirement in the Act for benefit/costanalysis, OMB thinks that pilot matches are a reasonable approach to determiningwhether to engage in a broader matching activity. OMB does not think thatthis kind of information gathering activity should be subject to the administrativerequirements that attach to regular matches so long as the agency keepsthese matches solely in a statistical information gathering channel. Nevertheless,OMB is sensitive to the concerns raised and has amended the guidance torequire Data Integrity Board approval of all pilot matches. It is at thispoint that the Board can decide whether to conduct a matching program andcomply with the Act's full requirements, or a pilot program. If a fullmatching program, the results of the match may be used to take adverseaction. If a pilot program, they may not.<ITAG tagnum="81">Law Enforcement Agency Exclusion</ITAG>One agency recommended that the guidance specifically cite the InspectorGeneral (IG) as a law enforcement agency. OMB failed to realize that commentatorswould be unaware that the Inspector General Act gave the Inspector criminallaw enforcement responsibilities. While we are hesitant to include a comprehensivelist of eligibles we have amended the guidance to cite that part of theIG office that performs criminal law enforcement activities as eligiblefor the exclusion.Two commentators were concerned that the proposed guidance on the law enforcementexclusion was too brief. OMB has expanded the discussion in the final versionto make it clear that that exception may only be taken by an agency orcomponent that is designated by statute (either Federal or State) as havinga criminal law enforcement responsibility as its primary purpose and thatit may only claim the exclusion after the initiation of an investigationof a named person or persons in order to gather evidence.<ITAG tagnum="81">Routine Administrative Matches Involving Federal Personnel Records</ITAG>One commentator suggested that OMB define the word ``predominantly'' asused in the exclusion. OMB has included a definition of this word to meanthat the data base either be established to contain records about Federalemployees, or that the majority of records in the data base be about suchemployees.Two commentators urged that OMB provide additional examples of what iscovered by the exclusion. OMB has amended the guidance to reflect thisconsideration.Section 5a(1)(c)_Federal Benefit Program<ITAG tagnum="81">Former Beneficiaries</ITAG>One commentator noted that the guidance was silent as to the Act's coverageof former beneficiaries and urged that OMB explicitly cite them. OMB agrees.The Act provides as one of its purposes the recouping of Federal benefitspayments. Certainly this process could involve those who are no longerbeneficiaries but remain in default. The guidance has been amended to includethis category of beneficiaries.Section 5a.b.c_Agency Responsibilities/Definitions<ITAG tagnum="81">Expand Discussion of Agencies' Roles/Responsibilities</ITAG>Several commentators suggested that OMB expand the definition section toclarify the roles and responsibilities of the recipient, source, and Non-Federalagencies, especially in terms of which is responsible for publishing matchingnotices in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. OMB agrees and has expanded this section.Section 6a_Giving Prior Notice<ITAG tagnum="81">Direct Notice Only</ITAG>One commentator strongly urged OMB to state that the Act requires directnotice to the record subject, and that <T4>Federal Register</T4> constructive notice is insufficient to meet thisrequirement. OMB has considered this comment, and agrees that the sectionrequires direct notice at the time of application. It does not, however,require direct notice at other times. Examination of the statutory wordingshows that the Act calls merely for ``notice'' subsequent to the directnotice at the time of application. This is understandable, since the pointat which it is most critical to provide notice is at the point when theindividual has the option of providing or withholding information. Noticeat this point permits the applicant to make an informed choice about participating.Moreover, for matching programs whose purpose is to locate individualsin order, for example, to recoup payments improperly granted, direct noticemay well be impossible. OMB thinks that the guidance as written gives agenciesthe flexibility to deal with the many circumstances involved in conductingmatching programs. However, OMB intends to monitor agencies' activitiesto ensure that constructive notice does not become an administrativelyconvenient substitute for direct notice when direct notice is achievablewithout an unreasonable expenditure of resources.<ITAG tagnum="81">Cite Section (e)(3) Requirement</ITAG>Two commentators cited the Privacy Act's (e)(3) notice as one appropriateplace for the matching notice and urged OMB to cite it as such in the guidance.OMB agrees and has done so.<ITAG tagnum="81">Federal/State Responsibilities</ITAG>One State agency asserted that the Federal agency should do the notice.OMB thinks that if a Federal form is involved in the application for abenefit, it is within the power of the Federal agency creating the formto provide the notice and it should do so. For periodic notice, however,Federal agencies may wish to accomplish this requirement through the Stateor local governmental benefit providers. OMB has included a discussionof this issue in the section on agency definitions and roles and responsibilities.Section 6b_Constructing Matching Agreements<ITAG tagnum="81">Existing Agreement Carryover</ITAG>One commentator suggested that the guidance assert that existing agreementscould suffice until the program was due for renewal and only at that timeshould they be revised to include the terms of the Matching Act. Similarly,a State commentator suggested that the existing State/Federal agreementsshould be sufficient. It is OMB's interpretation that the statute clearlyrequires that by the effective date of the Act, any matching programs conductedby an agency must have agreements approved by the Data Integrity Boards.The statute sets out the terms of those agreements. To the extent thatexisting agreements include these elements, they will suffice. If theydo not, any missing elements must be agreed to by the participants.<ITAG tagnum="81">Duplication and Redisclosure</ITAG>Two commentators strongly urged OMB to expand the discussion of this sectionto substantially restrict any subsequent use of the matching data by therecipient agency. Both cited the ``essential purpose'' wording of the statuteas being more restrictive than the ``compatibility standard'' that appliesto routine use disclosures. OMB agrees and has expanded the discussionof this point in the guidance.Section 6b_Publication Requirements<ITAG tagnum="81">Inclusion of System(s) of Records</ITAG>One commentator suggested that the matching notice identify the systemor systems of records from which records will be matched. OMB agrees andhas adopted this suggestion.Section 6f_Independent Verification, Notice and Wait Period, Opportunityto Contest Adverse Finding<ITAG tagnum="81">Combining the Independent Verification and Statutory Notice Requirements</ITAG>Federal benefits program matching as well as the matching of Federal employeerecords occurs across a wide spectrum of purposes and consequences. Itwould be of dubious utility to apply the verification requirements equallyto all matches and argue that a match that results in an adverse consequenceof the loss of, for example, a tuition assistance payment should receivethe same due process procedures as one that results in the loss of an AFDCpayment or Food Stamp Program eligibility. This is not to say that agenciescan ignore or minimize these requirements for matches that result in lesssevere consequences; but only that they should bring some degree of reasonablenessto the process of verifying data.Conservation of agency resources dictates that the procedures for affordingdue process be flexible and suited to the data being verified and the consequenceto the individual of making a mistake. In some cases, if the source agencyhas established a high degree of confidence in the quality of its dataand it can demonstrate that its quality control processes are rigorous,the recipient agency may choose to expend fewer resources in independentlyverifying the data than otherwise. Indeed, several commentators urged OMBto make it clear that in certain circumstances, the verification and noticeand wait steps can be combined into one. OMB agrees and has amended thesections to permit this occurrence; but, to make it clear that agenciesshould think through carefully when to use this compression and not considerit a routine process. To ensure that this consideration takes place, OMBhas amended the guidance to require that the Data Integrity Boards makea formal determination of when to compress these two due process steps.OMB will collect these decisions as part of the reporting process.<ITAG tagnum="81">Time Period for Notice</ITAG>One commentator suggested that because the waiting period provided by theMatching Act was 30 days (or more if program statues or regulations provideda longer period), the guidance should reflect this minimum period and notarbitrarily add transit time. On reflection, OMB agrees and has amendedthe section.<ITAG tagnum="81">Coercing Record Subjects</ITAG>One commentator expressed concern lest agencies attempt to coerce subjectsinto accepting the agencies adverse finding. The solution offered was toprohibit agencies from taking any action until the expiration of the 30days notice and wait period. In order to forestall some speculative behavioron the part of the agency, this solution could put the government in theposition of providing a benefit it knows improper to a recipient who hasacknowledged his ineligibility. OMB has not adopted the suggestion buthas included a caution to agencies against coercing individuals into agreeingwith the finding.<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 7a_Data Integrity Board Operation Location</ITAG>Two commentators were unclear about whether State and local agencies wererequired to have such boards. OMB has amended the guidance to make it clearthat the Data Integrity Board requirement applies only to Federal agencies.Another commentator suggested that having approval by both a source anda recipient Board was unnecessary. OMB disagrees. A significant purposeof the Act is to ensure that all parties to a matching program have enoughinformation to make a reasoned decision about participating and that eachunderstands the process whereby the data will be matched. One should notethat there are civil remedies provisions in the Privacy Act as well ascriminal penalties for wrongful acts. It is in the interest of all partiesto ensure that the Privacy Act requirements are adequately met.<ITAG tagnum="81">Operation</ITAG>One commentator urged OMB to flatly prohibit delegation of approval ofmatching agreements. OMB agrees and has amended the guidance to make itclear that approvals (and denials) must be done by the Board itself. Anothercommentator suggested OMB establish a time limitation for Board determinations.OMB thinks this is a management matter best left to agency discretion buthas added an instruction to agencies that they ensure expeditious consideration.<ITAG tagnum="81">Review and Reports</ITAG>One commentator recommended OMB expand the review and report requirementsof the Data Integrity Boards. OMB agrees but is in the process of revisingCircular No. A-130, Appendix I, to include these requirements. The commentatoralso suggested that OMB tell agencies to treat the annual review periodas beginning on the effective date of the Act. OMB will include this suggestionin the revision.Section 7c_Benefit Cost Requirement<ITAG tagnum="81">Waivers of Requirement</ITAG>One commentator recommended that OMB make it clear that the benefit-costrequirement be waived for matches done either pursuant to a statutory requirementor for a law enforcement purpose. OMB disagrees. The statute permits waiverfor statutory matches, but only for the first year. The intent of the drafterswas to recognize that the presumption the Act imposes of a favorable benefit-costratio was irrelevant in the face of a statutory mandate to match. Nevertheless,the Act requires a benefit-cost determination in subsequent years in orderto provide information to Congress about required matches that are notachieving a cost-beneficial result. As to law enforcement matches, thestatute already excludes a significant portion of such matches from allof the Act's requirements. Another commentator recommended that the requirementfor all matches done to recoup payments be waived since the results, i.e.,ultimate recoveries, are generally uncertain. This suggestion brings upan important point about conducting these assessments: there will be arange of data available to agencies in performing benefit-cost analysis,some of which will be helpful and some of which will be merely speculative.Where data in an agency's hands clearly indicates an unfavorable ratio,prudent management dictates abandoning the match. Where the reverse istrue, agencies should conduct the match. Where the data is unclear, agenciesshould gather data to permit a better analysis. This may mean conductinga program on the basis of data that, while speculative, suggests that theresult will be favorable, and then subjecting the results of the matchto careful analysis to determine if that is the case. OMB expects thatfor the first year, benefit-cost analysis will be a less rigorous processthan for subsequent years.Two commentators suggested that waivers be granted only where the analysiswas impossible to do or would be unhelpful. OMB has not adopted this suggestionfinding this standard to be too subjective to provide a solid basis onwhich to waive the requirement. OMB will include as a reflection of Congressionalintent, a statement that waivers should be granted sparingly if at all.<ITAG tagnum="81">Benefit-Cost Checklist and Methodology</ITAG>Two commentators urged that a checklist providing a step-by-step methodologyfor accomplishing benefit-cost analysis be appended to the guidance. OMBagrees that this should be done and is working on such a checklist butis doubtful that it will be ready in time to be added to the final guidance.Rather than delay publication past the statutory deadline, OMB will issuethe checklist as soon as it is available in the same manner as it issuesthe guidance itself. OMB will also cite the GAO Report, Computer Matching:Assessing its Costs and Benefits, GAO/PEMD-87-2, November 1986, in thesection.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Comments</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Disclosures for Matching</ITAG>Several commentators urged OMB to discuss the ways in which records couldbe disclosed for a matching program. One in particular wanted to know ifthere was an exception in section (b) of the Privacy Act for matching disclosures.OMB has added a discussion of the procedural requirements to the matchingagreements section. It notes that agencies must find an exception to thewritten consent rule in section (b) or obtain the written consent of therecord subject to the disclosure; there is no specific exception for amatching program.<ITAG tagnum="81">Denial of an IG Proposal</ITAG>One commentator urged that the guidance make it clear that disapprovalof an Inspector General proposed match could take place only because ofa defect in the matching agreement. OMB agrees that the proper role ofthe Board is not to engage in management decisions about the utility ofconducting matching programs, but to ensure that such programs are carriedout in strict compliance with the terms of the Privacy Act, as amendedby Pub. L. 100-503, and ``all relevant statutes, regulations and guidelines.''Nevertheless, it is the responsibility of the Board to ensure that eachof the terms of the agreements are complied with. That determination mayrequire them to go beneath the written agreement to examine the matchingprocess itself. For example, if the agreement indicates that matching subjectshave been given individualized notice at the time of the application onthe application form itself, the Board may wish to examine the form tosee if this notice is adequate.<ITAG tagnum="81">Training</ITAG>One commentator suggested that OMB set up training in the Act's provisions.OMB agrees and is working on a training program that will address thissuggestion.<ITAG tagnum="85">Office of Management and Budget Guidelines on the Conduct of MatchingPrograms</ITAG>1. <T3>Purpose: </T3>These Guidelines augment and should be used with the``Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidelines on the Administrationof the Privacy Act of 1974,'' issued on July 1, 1975, and supplementedon November 21, 1975, and Appendix I to OMB Circular No. A-130, publishedon December 24, 1985 (see 50 FR 52738). They are intended to help agenciesrelate the procedural requirements of the Privacy Act (as amended by Pub.L. 100-503, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988_hereinafterreferred to as the Computer Matching Act), with the operational requirementsof automated matching programs. These are policy guidelines applicableto the extent permitted by law. They do not authorize activities that arenot permitted by law; nor do they prohibit activities expressly requiredto be performed by law. Complying with these Guidelines, nonetheless, doesnot relieve a Federal agency of the obligation to comply with the provisionsof the Privacy Act, including any provisions not cited in these Guidelines.2. <T3>Authority: </T3>Section 6 of Pub. L. 100-503, The Computer Matchingand Privacy Protection Act of 1988, requires OMB to issue implementationguidance on the Amendments.3. <T3>Scope: </T3>These guidelines apply primarily to all Federal agenciessubject to the Privacy Act of 1974. For this purpose, the Privacy Act reliesupon the definition in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 5 U.S.C. 552at (e): ``any executive department, military department, government corporation,government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executivebranch of the government (including the Executive Office of the President),or any independent regulatory agency.'' For the purposes of these guidelines,components of departments, e.g., the Health Care Financing Administrationof the Department of Health and Human Services, are not considered individualagencies.Note that the definition incorporates the ``agency'' definition used inthe Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 at (1)) which also containsa series of categories that are not covered, including State and localgovernments.The Computer Matching Act amendment, however, brings State and local governmentswithin the ambit of the Privacy Act when they are engaging in certain typesof matching activities; but only in conjunction with a Federal agency thatis itself subject to the Privacy Act, and only when a Federal system ofrecords is involved in the match.In general, a State or local agency or agent thereof, that is either: (1)Providing records to a Federal agency for use in a matching program coveredby the Act; or (2) receiving records from a Federal agency's system ofrecords for use in a matching program covered by the Act, must comply withcertain of the Act's provisions. What State and local governments mustdo to meet the requirements of the Act is explained in paragraph 9 below.4. <T3>Effective Date: </T3>These guidelines are effective on June 19, 1989.5. <T3>Definitions: </T3>The Computer Matching Act is an amendment of thePrivacy Act of 1974 and the provisions of the former should be read withinthe context of the latter, and all the terms originally defined in thePrivacy Act of 1974 apply.It is especially important to note that the Computer Matching Act doesnot extend Privacy Act coverage to those not originally included. Thus,the subjects of Federal systems of records covered by the Computer MatchingAct are ``individuals,'' i.e., U.S. citizens and aliens lawfully admittedfor permanent residence.Two definitions that are especially relevent to matching programs are:<ITAG tagnum="15">_``</ITAG><T3>Record</T3>'' which the Privacy Act defines as an item of informationabout an individual, including his or her name or some other identifier;and, <ITAG tagnum="15">_``</ITAG><T3>System of Records</T3>'' which is a collection of such ``records''from which an agency retrieves information by reference to an individualidentifier.In addition, the Computer Matching Act provides the following new terms:a. <T3>Matching Program. </T3>At its simplest, a matching program is the comparisonof records using a computer. The records must themselves exist in automatedform in order to perform the match. Manual comparisons of, for example,printouts of two automated data bases, are not included within this definition.Note, however, participating agencies should not create data sharing methodsmerely to avoid the reach of the Act where the Act's application wouldotherwise be reasonable and proper. A matching program covers not onlythe actual computerized comparison, but the investigative followup andultimate action, if any.The Computer Matching Act covers two kinds of matching programs: (1) Matchesinvolving Federal benefits programs and, (2) matches using records fromFederal personnel or payroll systems of records.(1) <T3>Federal Benefits Matches. </T3>The Act defines a Federal benefits matchingprogram as:<ITAG tagnum="21">``any computerized comparison of two or more automated systems ofrecords or a system of records with non-Federal records, by applicantsfor, recipients or beneficiaries of, participants in, or providers of serviceswith respect to, cash or in-kind assistance or payments under Federal benefitprograms * * * [i.e., any program administered or funded by the Federalgovernment, or by any agent or State on behalf of the Federal government,providing cash or in-kind assistance in the form of payments, grants, loans,or loan guarantees to individuals], * * * for the purpose of establishingor verifying the eligibility of or continuing compliance with statutoryand regulatory requirements, or [for the purpose of] recouping paymentsor delinquent debts under such Federal benefit programs.'' (See 5 U.S.C.552a(a)(8) and (12).)</ITAG>The elements of this definition are discussed below:(a) <T3>Computerized Comparison of Data. </T3>The record comparison must bea computerized comparison involving records from:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Two or more automated systems of records (i.e., systems of recordsmaintained by Federal agencies that are subject to the Privacy Act); or,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A Federal agency's automated system of records and automated recordsmaintained by a non-Federal (i.e., State or local government) agency oragent thereof. To be covered, matches of these records must be computerized.Some examples of computerized matches include the following:</ITAG>A State benefits clerk accesses an automated Federal system of recordsand enters data received from an applicant and maintained in automatedform by the State. The clerk matches this information with the Federalinformation, makes an eligibility determination and updates the State database.A State benefits clerk enters data about applicants for a Federal benefitprogram into an automated data base. At the end of the week, the Stateagency sends current applicant tapes to the Federal benefits agency whichmatches them against its own automated system of records and reports theresults to the State.A Federal agency operating a benefits program sends a tape of defaultersto the Office of Personnel Management to match against an OPM automatedsystem of records containing information about Federal retirees in orderto locate defaulters.(b) <T3>Categories of Subjects Covered. </T3>The Computer Matching Act provisonscover only the following categories of record subjects:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Applicants for Federal benefit programs (i.e., individuals initiallyapplying for benefits);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Program beneficiaries (i.e., individual program participants whoare currently receiving or formerly received benefits);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Providers of services to support such programs (i.e., those who arenot the primary beneficiaries of Federal benefits programs, but may deriveincome from them_health care providers, for example).</ITAG>(c) <T3>Types of Programs Covered.</T3> Only Federal benefit programs providingcash or in-kind assistance to individuals are covered by this definition.State programs are not covered. Federal programs not involving cash orin-kind assistance are not covered. Programs using records about subjectswho are not individuals as defined by section (a)(2) of the Privacy Act_U.S.citizens or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence_are not covered.(d)<T3> Matching Purpose.</T3> The match must have as its purpose one or moreof the following:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Establishing or verifying initial or continuing eligibility for Federalbenefit programs; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Verifying compliance with the requirements_either statutory or regulatory_ofsuch programs; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Recouping payments or delinquent debts under such Federal benefitprograms.</ITAG>It should be noted that the four elements, (i.e., computerized comparison,categories of subjects, Federal benefit program, and matching purpose)all must be present before a matching program is covered under the provisionsof the Computer Matching Act. Thus, for example, if the Department of Educationmatched a student loan recipient data base with a Veterans Administration(VA) education benefit recipient data base for the purpose of ensuringthat both agencies were maintaining the most current and accurate homeaddress information, that would not be covered since the ``matching purpose''is not one of the three enumerated above. If, however, the purpose of thematch were to identify recipients who were receiving benefits in excessof those to which they were entitled, the match would be covered.Moreover, elements that are peripheral to the match, even if within thedefinitions above will not raise a match to the Act's coverage. For example,the Federal Parent Locator Service conducts matches to locate absenteeparents who are not paying child support. Such matches may result in theidentified spouse being ordered to commence payments, and some of thosepayments may go to recoup payments made from a Federal benefit programsuch as Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Because the recoupmentis not the primary purpose of the match, but only an incidental consequence,such matches would not be covered.(2) <T3>Federal Personnel or Payroll Records Matches. </T3>The Computer MatchingAct also includes matches comparing records from automated Federal personnelor payroll systems of records, or such records and automated records ofState and local governments. Again, it should be noted that the comparisonmust be done by using a computer; manual comparisons are not covered. Matchesin this category must be done for other than ``routine administrative purposes''as defined in paragraph 5a(3)(e) below. In some instances, a covered matchmay take place within a single agency. For example, an agency may wishto determine whether any of its own personnel are participating in a benefitprogram administered by the agency, and are not in compliance with theprogram's eligibility requirements. This internal match will certainlyresult in an adverse action if ineligibility is discovered. Therefore,it is covered by the requirements of the Computer Matching Act. Again,agencies should not attempt to avoid the reach of the Act by, for example,improperly combining dissimilar systems into a single system, matchingdata within the system to make an eligibility determination, and arguingthat the match is not covered because only one system of records is involved.(3) <T3>Exclusions from the Definition of a Matching Program. </T3>The followingare not included under the definition of matching programs. Agencies operatingsuch programs are not required to comply with the provisions of the ComputerMatching Act, although they may be required to comply with any other applicableprovisions of the Privacy Act.(a) <T3>Statistical Matches Whose Purpose is Solely to Produce Aggregate DataStripped of Personal Identifiers.</T3> This does not mean that the databases used in the match must be stripped prior to the match, but only thatthe results of the match must not contain individually identifiable data.Implicit in this exception is that this kind of match is not done to takeaction against specific individuals; although, it is possible that thestatistical inferences drawn from the data may have consequences for thesubjects of the match as members of a class or group. For example, a continuingmatching program that shows one geographical area consistently experiencinga higher default rate than others may result in more rigorous scrutinyof applicants from that area, but would not be a covered matching program.(b) <T3>Statistical Matches Whose Purpose is in Support of Any Research orStatistical Project. </T3>The results of these matches need not be strippedof identifiers, but they must not be used to make decisions that affectthe rights, benefits or privileges of specific individuals. Again, it shouldbe noted that this provision is not intended to prohibit using any datadeveloped in these matches to make decisions about a Federal benefit programin general that may ultimately affect beneficiaries.(c) <T3>Pilot Matches. </T3>This exclusion could also cover so-called ``pilotmatches,'' i.e., small scale matches whose purpose is to gather benefit/costdata on which to premise a decision about engaging in a full-fledged matchingprogram. Because of concern about possible misuse of these matching programsto avoid full compliance with the Matching act, OMB will require that pilotmatches must be approved by the agency Data Integrity Boards. It is atthis point that the agency can decide whether to conduct a statisticaldata gathering match without consequences to the subjects or a full-fledgedprogram where results will be used to take specific action against recordsubjects.(d) <T3>Law Enforcement Investigative Matches Whose Purpose is to Gather EvidenceAgainst a Named Person or Persons in an Existing Investigation. </T3>Certainmatches performed in support of civil or criminal law enforcement activitiesthat otherwise would be covered because they seek to establish or verifyFederal benefit eligibility or use Federal personnel or payroll records,are excluded from coverage by this section. To be eligible for exclusion,the match must be done by an agency or component whose principal statutoryfunction involves the enforcement of criminal laws, i.e., an agency thatis eligible to exempt certain of its record systems under section (j)(2)of the Privacy Act such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the DrugEnforcement Agency, or components of agencies' Office of Inspectors General.The match must flow from an investigation already underway which focuseson a named person or named persons; ``fishing expeditions'' in which thesubjects are identified generically as ``program beneficiaries,'' are noteligible for this exclusion (note that the investigation may be into eithercriminal or civil law violations). The use of the phrase ``person or persons''in this context broadens the exclusion to include subjects that are otherthan ``individuals'' as defined by the Privacy Act. Thus, for example abusiness entity could be the named subject of the investigation, whilethe records matched could be those of customers or clients. This does notmean however, that the rights afforded by the Privacy Act are extendedby this section to other than ``individuals.''Finally, the match must be for the purpose of gathering evidence againstthe named person or persons.(e) <T3>Tax Administration Matches.</T3> There are four specific categoriesexclusions for matches using ``tax information.'' While that term is notdefined in the Computer Matching Act, the Report accompanying the Houseversion of the Act, H.R. 4699, cites ``tax returns'' and ``tax return information''as the tax information that is covered by the exclusion. Those terms aredefined in Section 6103 of Title 26 U.S.C. at (b)(1)-(b)(3). It is clearfrom these sections that the information covered is under the control ofthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the Department of the Treasury sincethe definitions speak of information that is ``filed with the Secretary''or ``received by, prepared by, furnished to, or collected by the Secretary.''Moreover, Section 6103(a) prohibits Federal, State and local governmentalemployees from disclosing tax information except as authorized by the InternalRevenue Code. This is not to say that all information in the possessionof the IRS is covered by the exclusion; only tax information. Thus, forexample, personnel records relating to the management of the IRS workforcewould not be covered.The exclusion covers the following:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Matches done pursuant to Section 6103(d) of the Tax Code. These matchesinvolve disclosures of taxpayer return information to State tax officials.For matches covered by this exclusion, neither the Federal disclosing entitynor the State recipient need comply with the provisions of the ComputerMatching Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Matches done for the purposes of ``tax administration'' as that termis defined in Section 6103(b)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code: ``The term`tax administration' means the administration, management, conduct, direction,and supervision of the execution and application of the internal revenuelaws or related statutes (or equivalent laws and statutes of a State) andtax conventions to which the United States is a party; and the developmentand formulation of Federal tax policy relating to existing or proposedinternal revenue laws, related statutes, and tax conventions; and includesassessment, collection, enforcement, litigation, publication, and statisticalgathering functions under such laws, statutes or conventions.'' While thisdefinition is very broad and covers a great deal of discretionary activitieson the part of IRS management, it is not intended to exempt all IRS activitiesfrom the Act's coverage; only those that truly relate to administrationof the nation's tax system (as opposed to management of the IRS workforce,for example). Thus, the exclusion will permit the IRS to continue to matchtax returns with interest and dividend statements, for example. It shouldbe noted that the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, and Tobacco of the TreasuryDepartment also has collection and enforcement authority under the InternalRevenue Code, and tax administration is, therefore, a part of that agency'sresponsibilities as well.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Tax refund offset matches done pursuant to the Deficit ReductionAct of 1984 (DEFRA). That Act contains procedures for affording matchingsubjects due process that are analogous to those contained in these guidelines.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Tax refund offset matches conducted pursuant to statutes other thanthe DEFRA provided OMB finds the due process provisions of those statutes``substantially similar'' to those of the DEFRA. OMB will periodicallyrevise these guidelines to add such programs as such statutes are enacted.Agencies should notify OMB promptly when they think an existing statuteprovides an exemption in this category.</ITAG>(f) <T3>Routine Administrative Matches Using Federal Personnel Records.</T3>These are matches between a Federal agency and other Federal agencies orbetween a Federal agency and non-Federal agencies for administrative purposesthat use data bases that contain records predominantly relating to Federalpersonnel. The term predominantly means that the percentage of recordsin the system that are about Federal employees must be greater than ofany other category therein contained. In some cases, Federal employeeswill predominate because of absolute numbers; in others, because they representthe largest single category. The term ``federal personnel'' is definedby the Act as: ``officers and employees of the Government of the UnitedStates, members of the uniformed services (including members of the Reservecomponents), individuals entitled to receive immediate or deferred retirementbenefits under any retirement program of the Government of the United States(including survivor benefits).'' It should be noted that by including individualseligible for survivor benefits in the category, the Act covers individualswho may never have been employed by the Federal government.Matches whose purpose is to take ``any adverse financial, personnel, disciplinaryor other adverse action against Federal personnel * * *'' whose recordsare involved in the match, are not excluded from the Act's coverage.Examples of matches that are excluded include an agency's disclosure oftime and attendance information on all agency employees to the Departmentof the Treasury in order to prepare the agency's payroll; or disclosureof Department of Defense (DoD) Reserve Officer identifying informationto a State in order to validate and update addresses of Reservists residingin the State; or disclosure of retiree annuity files from the DoD to theDepartment of Veterans Affairs in order to determine the percentage oftotal annuity each agency is responsible for paying.Note that this exclusion does not bring under the Act's coverage matchesthat may ultimately result in an adverse action. It only requires thattheir purpose not be intended to result in an adverse action. Thus, inthe DoD/State reservist match example, the consequence of the match maywell be that a reservist is dropped from the program because no addresscan be found for him or her. This result, however negative, would not bringthe match under the Act's coverage since its primary purpose was only toupdate an address listing.(g) <T3>Internal Agency Matches Using Only Records From the Agency's Systemof Records.</T3> Internal agency matching is excluded on the same basisas Federal personnel record matching above: provided no adverse intentas to a Federal employee motivates the match. Section (b)(1) of the PrivacyAct permits agencies to disseminate Privacy Act records to agency employeeson an official need-to-know basis. This exclusionary provision does notdisturb that principle, except where Federal personnel records are involved.Thus, for example, the Social Security Administration could match withthe Health Care Financing Administration to detect and ultimately recoupoverpayments for a specific Department of Health and Human Services program.That match would not be covered by the provisions of the Computer MatchingAct.Moreover, the mere presence of Federal employee records in the data basesbeing matched would not necessarily bring the match under the Act's coverage.To be covered, the records would have to be predominantly those relatingto Federal employees and the primary intent would have to be to take anadverse action of some kind against the Federal employees specifically.If the Department of Education matched its student loan defaulter fileagainst its own employee data base in order to detect and take action againstEducation employees who have defaulted, that match would be covered bythe Act. The same department matching its undergraduate student loan defaulterfile against its medical school loan defaulter file in order to determinethe incidence of repeat defaulters, would not be covered, even though someof those in the data base might be Federal employees.(h) <T3>Background Investigation and Foreign Counter-intelligence Matches.</T3>Matches done in the course of performing a background check for securityclearances of Federal personnel or Federal contractor personnel are notcovered. Nor are matches done for the purpose of foreign counter-intelligence.b. <T3>Recipient Agency.</T3> Recipient agencies are Federal agencies (ortheir contractors) that receive records from the Privacy Act systems ofrecords of other Federal agencies or from State and local governments tobe used in matching programs.<T3>Responsibilities.</T3> Recipient agencies are responsible for publishingmatching notices in the Federal Register pursuant to the requirements ofthe Matching Act described below. Where a recipient agency is not the actualbeneficiary of the matching program, it may negotiate with the actual beneficiaryagency for reimbursement of the costs incurred in publishing. A recipientagency that is the beneficiary of the program should take the lead in performinga benefit-cost analysis and share that analysis with source agencies tohelp their Data Integrity Boards make a determination about providing datafor the match. Recipient agencies are also responsible for making the matchingprogram report to OMB and the Congress discussed below.c. <T3>Source Agency. </T3>A source agency is a Federal agency that disclosesrecords from a system of records to another Federal agency to a State orlocal governmental agency to be used in a matching program. It is alsoa State or local governmental agency that discloses records to a Federalagency to be used in a matching program. The Computer Matching Act doesnot cover matching between non-Federal entities. A Federal source agencyis required to have its own Data Integrity Board approve the agreementcontrolling the match; Non-Federal agencies are not required to have suchboards. Source agencies are not responsible for publishing the notice ofthe match or reporting the match to OMB and Congress.d. <T3>Non-Federal Agency. </T3>A non-Federal agency is a State or local governmentalagency that receives records contained in a system of records from a Federalagency to be used in a matching program. State and local agencies are notresponsible for publishing notices in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> or making reports to OMB and the Congress. Norare they required to establish Data Integrity Boards to approve matchingagreements. They should be prepared to provide to Federal source agenciesdata needed by those agencies to carry out their reporting and other responsibilties,e.g., benefit-cost analysis.e. <T3>Federal Benefit Program. </T3>See paragraph 5a(1)(c) above.6. <T3>Conducting Matching Programs. </T3>The following applies to Federalagencies. Requirements pertaining to non-Federal agencies are in paragraph9 below.Agencies undertaking matching programs covered by the Computer MatchingAct will need to make sure that they comply with the following requirements:a. <T3>Comply with Privacy Act Systems of Records and Disclosure Provisions:</T3>Federal agencies must ensure that they identify the systems of recordsinvolved in the matching programs and have published the necessary notices.Moreover, because the Matching Act does not itself authorize disclosuresfrom systems of records for the purposes of conducting matching programs,agencies must justify any disclosures under section (b) of the PrivacyAct. This means obtaining the written consent of the record subjects tothe disclosure or relying on one of the 12 exceptions to the written consentrule. To rely on exception (b)(3), for a routine use, agencies must havepublished their intent to disclose in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> 30 days prior to any actual disclosure.b. <T3>Give Prior Notice to Record Subjects. </T3>There are two ways in whichrecord subjects can receive notice that their records may be matched:<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>By direct notice</T3> when there is some form of contact between thegovernment and the subject, e.g., information on the application form whenthey apply for a benefit or in a notice that arrives with a benefit thatthey receive;<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>By constructive notice, </T3>e.g., publication of systems notices,routine use disclosures, and matching programs in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.For front-end eligibility verification programs whose purpose is to validatean applicant's initial eligibility for a benefit and later to determinecontinued eligibility, agencies should provide direct notice by amendingthe application form where necessary to enlarge the statement providedpursuant to section (e)(3) of the Privacy Act so that applicants are puton notice that the information they provide may be verified through a computermatch. Agencies should also provide periodic notice whenever the applicationis renewed, or at the least, during the period the match is authorizedto take place, in a notice accompanying the benefit. Providers of servicesshould be given notice on the form on which they apply for reimbursementfor services provided.In some cases, constructive notice may have to suffice. For example, aFederal agency that discloses records to a State or local government insupport of a non-Federal matching program is not obligated to provide directnotice to each of the record subjects; <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication in this instance is sufficient. Moreover,in some instances, it may not be possible to provide direct notice_in matchesdone to locate individuals, in emergency situations where health and safetyreasons argue for a swift completion of the match; or in investigativematches where direct notice immediately prior to a match would providethe subject an opportunity to alter behavior.In any case, notice to the record subject should be done well before amatching program commences. It should be part of the normal process ofimplementing a Federal benefits program.c. <T3>Matching Notices_Publication Requirements. </T3>Agencies must publishnotices of the establishment or alteration of matching programs in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> at least 30 days prior to conducting such programs.Only one notice is required and the recipient Federal agency in a matchbetween Federal agencies or in a match in which a non-Federal agency disclosesrecords to a Federal agency is responsible for publishing such notices.Where a State or local agency is the recipient of records from a Federalagency's system of records, the Federal source agency is responsible forpublishing the notice. Such notices should contain the following information:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Name of participating agency or agencies;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Purpose of the match;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Authority for conducting the matching program. (It should be notedthat the Computer Matching Act provides no independent authority for carryingout any matching activity);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Categories or records and individuals covered;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Inclusive dates of the matching program;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Address for receipt of public comments or inquiries.</ITAG>Copies of proposed matching notices must accompany reports of proposedmatches submitted pursuant to section (r) of the Privacy Act as amended.See OMB Circular No. A-130, Appendix I, as amended.d. <T3>Preparing and Executing Matching Agreements. </T3>Agencies should allowsufficient lead time to ensure that matching agreements can be negotiatedand signed in time to secure Data Integrity Board decisions. Federal agenciesreceiving records from or disclosing records to non-Federal agencies foruse in matching programs are responsible for preparing the matching agreementsand should solicit relevant data from non-Federal agencies where necessary.In cases where matching takes place entirely within an agency under theFederal personnel or payroll matching provisions, the agency may satisfythe matching agreement requirements by preparing a Memorandum of Understandingbetween the system of records managers involved, and presenting that tothe Data Integrity Board for consideration.Agreements must contain the following:<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Purpose and Legal Authority. </T3>Since the Computer Matching Act providesno independent authority for the operation of matching programs, agenciesshould cite a specific Federal or State statutory or regulatory basis forundertaking such programs.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Justification and Expected Results. </T3>An explanation of why computermatching as opposed to some other administrative activity is being proposedand what the expected results will be.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Records Description. </T3>An identification of the system of recordsor non-Federal records, the number of records, and what data elements willbe included in the match. Projected starting and completion dates for theprogram should also be provided. Agencies should specifically identifythe Federal system or systems of records involved.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Notice Procedures. </T3>A description of the individual and generalperiodic notice procedures. See paragraph 6.a., above.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Verification Procedures. </T3>A description of the methods the agencywill use to independently verify the information obtained through the matchingprogram. See paragraph 6.f., below.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Disposition of Matched Items.</T3> A statement that information generatedthrough the match, will be destroyed as soon as it has served the matchingprogram's purpose and any legal retention requirements the agency establishesin conjunction with the National Archives and Records Administration orother cognizant authority.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Security Procedures.</T3> A description of the administrative and technicalsafeguards to be used in protecting the information. They should be commensuratedwith the level of sensitivity of the data. <ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Records Usage, Duplication and Redisclosure Restrictions. </T3>A descriptionof any specific restrictions imposed by either the source agency or bystatute or regulation on collateral uses of the records used in the matchingprogram. The agreement should specify how long a recipient agency may keeprecords provided for a matching program, and when they will be returnedto the source agency or destroyed. In general, recipient agencies shouldnot subsequently disclose records obtained for a matching program and underthe terms of a matching agreement for other purposes absent a specificstatutory requirement or where the disclosure is essential to the conductof a matching program. The essential standard is a strict test that ismore restrictive than the ``compatibility'' standard the Privacy Act establishesfor disclosures made pursuant to section (b)(3): ``for a routine use.''Thus, under the essential standard, the results of the match may be disclosedfor follow-up and verification or for civil or criminal law enforcementinvestigation or prosecution if the match uncovers activity that warrantssuch a result. This is not to say that agencies may never use the resultsof a matching program to make other eligibility determinations. For example,in the case of State/SSA COLA adjustment matches, States may use the resultsof this match to adjust payment levels for other benefits programs. Ifthey do so, however, the subsequent uses must be included as part of theoverall matching program as to the matching agreements, <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, and the reporting requirements. Moreover,the Act's due process requirements will apply to the subsequent adjustmentsas well. <ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Records Accuracy Assessments. </T3>Any information relating to thequality of the records to be used in the matching program. Record accuracyis important from two standpoints. In the first case, the worse the qualityof the data, the less likely a matching program will have a cost-beneficialresult. In the second case, the Privacy Act requires Federal agencies tomaintain records they maintain in systems of records to a standard of accuracythat will reasonably assure fairness in any determination made on the basisof the record. Thus an agency receiving records from another Federal agencyor from a non-Federal agency needs to know information about the accuracyof such records in order to comply with the law. Moreover, the PrivacyAct also requires agencies to take reasonable steps to ensure the accuracyof records that are disclosed to non-Federal recipients. <ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Comptroller General Access.</T3> A statement that the Comptroller Generalmay have access to all records of a recipient agency or non-Federal agencynecessary to monitor or verify compliance with the agreement. It shouldbe understood that this requirement permits the Comptroller General toinspect State and local records used in matching programs covered by theseagreements.e. <T3>Securing Approval of Data Integrity Boards. </T3> Before an agencymay participate in a matching program, the agency's Data Integrity Boardmust have evaluated the proposed match and approved the terms of the matchingagreement. Agencies should ensure that boards consider matching proposalspresented to them expeditiously so as not to cause bureaucratic delaysto necessary programs. (See paragraph 7.d. below, for appeals of Boarddisapprovals). f. <T3>Reports to OMB and Congress. </T3> See OMB Circular No. A-130, AppendixI as amended. g. <T3> Providing Due Process to Matching Subjects. </T3> The Computer MatchingAct prescribes certain due process requirements that the subjects of matchingprograms must be afforded when matches uncover adverse information aboutthem. <ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Verification of Adverse Information.</T3> Agencies may not premiseadverse action upon the raw results of a computer match. Any adverse informationso developed must be subjected to investigation and verification beforeaction is taken. Federal benefits program matching as well as the matchingof Federal employee records occurs across a wide spectrum of purposes andconsequences. It would be of dubious utility to apply the verificationrequirements equally to all matches and argue that a match that resultsin an adverse consequence of the loss of, for example, a tuition assistancepayment should receive the same due process procedures as one that resultsin the loss of an AFDC payment or Food Stamp Program eligibility. Thisis not to say that agencies can ignore or minimize these requirements formatches that result in less severe consequences; but only that they shouldbring some degree of reasonableness to the process of verifying data.Conservation of agency resources dictates that the procedures for affordingdue process be flexible and suited to the data being verified and the consequenceto the individual of making a mistake. In some cases, if the source agencyhas established a high degree of confidence in the quality of its dataand it can demonstrate that its quality control processes are rigorous,the recipient agency may choose to expend fewer resources in independentlyverifying the data than otherwise. In such cases, it may be appropriateto combine the verification and notice requirements into a single step,especially if the record subject is the best source for verification. Incertain circumstances, therefore, the verification and notice and waitsteps can be combined into one. However, agencies should think throughcarefully when to use this compression and not consider it a routine process.To ensure that this consideration take place, it will be the responsibilityof the Data Integrity Boards to make a formal determination as to whenit is appropriate to compress the verification and notice and wait periodsinto a single period. OMB intends to collect these decisions as part ofthe reporting process. In many cases, the individual record subject is the best source for determininga finding's validity, and he or she should be contacted where practicable.In other cases, the payer of a benefit will have the most accurate recordrelating to payment and should be contacted for verification. Note that,in some cases, contacting the subject initially may permit him or her toconceal data relevant to a decision; and, in those cases, an agency mayelect to examine other sources. Absolute confirmation is not required;a reasonable verification process that yields confirmatory data will prividethe agency with a reasonable basis for taking action. As to applicants for Federal benefits programs whose eligibility is beingverified through a matching program, agencies may not make a final determinationuntil they have completed the due process steps the Act requires. Thisdoes not mean, however, that they are required to place an applicant onthe rolls pending a determination, but only that they may not make a finaldecision. For matching subjects receiving benefits, however, agencies may not suspendor reduce payments until the due process steps have been completed.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Notice and Opportunity to Contest. </T3>Agencies are required to notifymatching subjects of adverse information uncovered and give them an opportunityto explain prior to making a final determination. Again, this does notmean that an applicant must be put on the rolls pending his or her explanation,but only that the agency may not make a final determination. Current benefitsrecipients, however, may not have those benefits suspended or reduced pendingthe expiration of this period.Individuals may have 30 days to respond to a notice of adverse action,unless a statute or regulation grants a longer period. The period runsfrom the date of the notice until 30 calendar days later, including transittime. If an individual contacts the agency within the notice period and indicateshis or her acceptance of the validity of the adverse information, agenciesmay take immediate action to deny or terminate. However, agencies are cautionedagainst attempting to coerce a record subject into accepting the result.Agencies may also take action if the period expires without contact. If the Federal benefit program involved in the match has its own due processrequirements, those requirements may suffice for the purposes of the ComputerMatching Act, provided they are at least as strong as that Act's provisions.In any case, if an agency determines that there is likely to be a potentiallysignificant effect on public health or safety, it may take appropriateaction, notwithstanding these due process provisions.  7. <T3>Establishing Data Integrity Boards: </T3>The Computer Matching Actrequires that each Federal agency that acts as either a source or recipientin a matching program, establish a Data Integrity Board to oversee theagency's participation. Non-Federal governmental entities are not requiredto have such boards. It should be noted that the fact that records aboutan agency's personnel are used in a matching program does not automaticallytrigger this requirement. Because, for example, the Office of PersonnelManagement (OPM) asserts government-wide ownership of the system of recordscontaining the Federal employee Official Personnel Folder (OPF), disclosuresfrom this system of records involve OPM, not the employing agency. Thereare many small agencies that will never directly disclose records fromtheir own systems of records for matching purposes and they are thus notrequired to establish Data Integrity Boards. a. <T3>Location and Staffing.</T3> While the Act specifies neither the organizationallevel at which the Boards are to be established, nor their makeup (withtwo exceptions), it is clear from the context of the Data Integrity Boardsection that Congress expected agencies to place the Boards at the topof the organization and staff them with senior personnel. It is the intentof these guidelines not to dictate a specific structure but to suggestways of complying with this expection.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Location.</T3> As to location, because the Boards are to serve a coordinatingfunction, it would be inappropriate to locate them at other than the departmentallevel (or its agency equivalent). This is not to say that subordinate boardsat component levels may not be useful to do the preliminary work necessaryto provide a matching program proposal to the senior Board for approval.Indeed, in large agencies with many matching programs, this will likelybe the rule. But, the approval should come from the top, and this arguesfor the placement suggested above.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Staffing.</T3> The Act requires that the Board consist of senior agencyofficials designated by the agency head. The only two mandatory membersare the Inspector General of the agency (if any) who may not serve as Chairman,and the senior official responsible for the implementation of the PrivacyAct who has been designated pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3506(b). OMB recommendsthat the agency Privacy Act Officer be designated as the Board's Secretary.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Operation.</T3> While much of the work of the Board may be delegatedto less senior members_for example, the compilation of reports, advisingof program officials, and maintaining and disseminating information aboutthe accuracy and reliability of data used in matching_the approval of matchingagreements may not be delegated.The Board should meet often enough to ensure that agency matching programsare carried out efficiently, expeditiously and in conformance with thePrivacy Act, as amended.b. <T3>Review Responsibilities.</T3> Because matching agreements are key tothe implementation of the Computer Matching Act, the Act makes their reviewthe foremost responsibility of the Boards. Boards are responsible for approvingor disapproving matching programs based upon their assessment of the adequacyof these agreements. They should ensure that their reasons for either approvingor denying are well documented. Agency officials proposing matching programsshould ensure that they provide the Data Integrity Board with all of theinformation relevant and necessary to permit it to make an informed decision,including, where appropriate, a benefit/cost analysis. Note that both theFederal source and recipient agencies must have the matching agreementratified by their boards.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Review of Proposals to Conduct or Participate in Matching Programs.</T3>The Board must review the matching agreements that support each proposedmatching program and find them in conformance with the provisions of theComputer Matching Act as well as any other relevant statutes, regulations,or guidelines. Boards are specifically responsible for determining whento compress the due process steps of verification and notice and wait intoa single step. A matching agreement should remain in force for only solong as necessary to accomplish the specific matching purpose; indeed,it automatically expires at the end of 18 months unless within 3 monthsprior to the actual expiration date, the Data Integrity Board finds thatthe program will be conducted without change and each party certifies thatthe program has been conducted in compliance with the matching agreement.Under this finding, the Board may extend the agreement for 1 additionalyear.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Annual Review.</T3> The Act requires Data Integrity Boards to conductan annual review of all matching programs in which the agency has participatedas either a source or recipient agency. This review has two focuses: todetermine whether the matches have been, or are being, conducted in accordancewith the appropriate authorities and under the terms of the matching agreements;and, to assess the utility of the programs in terms of their costs andbenefits. The Act suggests that this latter review as it pertains to recurringprograms, should result in a basis for continuing participation in, oroperation of, such programs. The Computer Matching Act also requires theBoards to review annually agency recordkeeping and disposal policies andpractices for conformance with the Act's provisions. These reviews shouldtake place within the context of the annual review referenced above. Inaddition, the Boards may review and report on matching activities not coveredby the Computer Matching Act.c. <T3>Benefit/Cost Analysis.</T3> The Computer Matching Act requires thata benefit/cost analysis be a part of an agency decision to conduct or participatein a matching program. The requirement occurs in two places: in matchingagreements which must include a justification of the proposed match witha ``specific estimate of any savings''; and, in the Data Integrity Boardreview process.The intent of this requirement is not to create a presumption that whenagencies balance individual rights and cost savings, the latter shouldinevitably prevail. Rather, it is to ensure that sound management practicesare followed when agencies use records from Privacy Act systems of recordsin matching programs. Particularly in a time when competition for scarceresources is especially intense, it is not in the government's intereststo engage in matching activities that drain agency resources that couldbe better spent elsewhere. Agencies should use the benefit/cost requirementas an opportunity to reexamine programs and weed out those that produceonly marginal results.While the Act appears to require a favorable benefit/cost ratio as an elementof approval of a matching program, agencies should be cautious about applyingthis interpretation in too literal a fashion. For example, the first yearin which a matching program is conducted may show a dramatic benefit/costratio. However, after it has been conducted on a regular basis (with attendantpublicity), its deterrent effect may result in much less favorable ratios.Elimination of such a program, however, may well result in a return tothe prematch benefit/cost ratio. The agency should consider not only theactual savings attributable to such a program, but the consequences ofabandoning it.For proposed matches without an operational history, benefit/cost analyseswill of necessity be speculative. While they should be based upon the bestdata available, reasonable estimates are acceptable at this stage. Nevertheless,agencies should design their programs so as to ensure the collection ofdata that will permit more accurate assessments to be made. As more andmore data become available, it should be possible to make more informedassumptions about the benefits and costs of matching. One source of informationabout conducting benefit-cost analysis as it relates to matching programsis the GAO Report, ``Computer Matching, Assessing its Costs and Benefits,''GAO/PEMD-87-2, November, 1986. Agencies may wish to consult this reportas they develop methodologies for performing this analysis.Because matching is done for a variety of reasons, not all matching programsare appropriate candidates for benefit/cost analysis. The Computer MatchingAct tacitly recognizes this point by permitting Data Integrity Boards towaive the benefit/cost requirement if they determine in writing that suchan analysis is not required. It should be noted, however, that the Congressexpected that such waivers would be used sparingly. The Act itself suppliesone such waiver: if a match is specifically required by statute, the initialreview by the Board need not consider the benefits and costs of the match.Note that this exclusion does not extend to matches undertaken at the discretionof the agency. However, the Act goes on to require that when the matchingagreement is renegotiated, a benefit/cost analysis covering the precedingmatches must be done. Note that the Act does not require the showing ofa favorable ratio for the match to be continued, only that an analysisbe done. The intention is to provide Congress with information to helpit evaluate the effectiveness of statutory matching requirements with aview to revising or eliminating them where appropriate.Other examples of matches in which the establishment of a favorable benefit/costratio would be inappropriate are:<ITAG tagnum="15">_A match of a system of records containing information about nursesemployed at VA hospitals with records maintained by State nurse licensingboards to identify VA nurses with ``impaired licenses'', i.e., those whohave had some disciplinary action taken against them.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A match whose purpose is to identify and correct erroneous data,e.g., Project Clean Data which was run to correct and eliminate erroneousSocial Security Numbers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Selective Service System matching to identify 18-year-olds for draftregistration purposes.</ITAG>d. <T3>Appeals of Denials.</T3> If a Board disapproves a matching agreement,the Computer Matching Act permits any party to the agreement to appealthat disapproval to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.While this literally means that a recipient agency (whether Federal ornon-Federal) could appeal the refusal of a source agency to approve anagreement, the actual results of such cross agency appeals, even if successful,are unlikely to result in the implementation of a matching program sincethe source agency may still properly refuse to disclose the necessary PrivacyAct records. Nothing in the appeal process is intended to result in oneagency being able to force another agency to participate unwillingly ina matching program.Accordingly, OMB will only entertain appeals from senior agency officialswho are parties to a proposed matching agreement that has been disapprovedby the agency's own Data Integrity Board. By senior officials, OMB meansthe Inspector General of an agency or the head of an operating divisioncarrying out the matching program.The appeal should be forwarded to the Director, Office of Management andBudget, Washington, DC 20503 within 30 days following the Board's writtendisapproval. The following documentation should accompany the appeal:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Copies of all of the documentation accompanying the initial matchingagreement proposal;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A copy of the Board's disapproval and reasons therefor;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness of the match;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Any other information relevant to a decision, e.g., timing considerations,the public interest served by the match, etc.</ITAG>The Director will promptly notify Congress of receipt of an appeal andof his or her decision. A decision to approve a matching agreement willnot be effective until 30 days after it is so reported to Congress. Thedecision of the Director shall be based upon the information submitted.OMB expects that this appeal process will be rarely used. One way to ensureits rarity is for agencies to present only well thoughtout and thoroughlydocumented proposals to the Boards for decisions.e. <T3>Information Maintenance and Dissemination Responsibilities. </T3>TheAct anticipates that the Data Integrity Boards will be an information resourceon matching for the agency. Thus, while the full Board may actually conveneonly a few times each year to consider matching program proposals, theAct requires a continuing presence to carry out these additional functions.The Board, therefore, should designate a representative to answer questionson matching both from within the agency and from outside entities. Thispoint of contact should be able to advise on what actions are needed tocomply with the provisions of the Computer Matching Act, and to collectand disseminate information on the quality of the records used in matchingprograms.8. <T3>General Reporting Requirements: </T3>The reporting requirements ofthe Data Integrity Boards will be contained in OMB Circular No. A-130,Appendix I. Matching reports are to be included in the general PrivacyAct implementation reporting requirements outlined in that Circular.9. <T3>Specific Responsibilities of Non-Federal Agencies: </T3>It is not theintent of this Act to affect, nor do its provisions reach, State and localgovernments using their own records for matching purposes. Nor does theAct reach State or local matching programs using records from Federal systemsof records for purposes other than those defined in the Act as for a ``matchingprogram.''Thus, for example, a Federal agency could disclose information about beneficiariesof a Federal program to a State agency in order to permit the State toconduct a matching program to determine eligibility for a State publicassistance program. So long as the purpose was to validate eligibilityfor the State as opposed to the Federal benefit program, the Computer MatchingAct would not come into play.If however, the Federal agency disclosed the names and income levels ofits own Federal employees to a State under these circumstances, the matchingrequirements would have to be met since this match would be covered underthe ``Federal employee personnel and payroll'' provisions.Non-Federal agencies intending to participate in covered matching programsare required to do the following:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Execute matching agreements prepared by a Federal agency or agenciesinvovled in the matching program;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Provide data to Federal agencies on the costs and benefits of matchingprograms;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Certify that they will not take adverse action against an individualas a result of any information developed in a matching program unless theinformation has been independently verified and until 30 days after theindividual has been notified of the findings and given an opportunity tocontest them. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_For renewals of matching programs, certify that the terms of theagreement have been followed.</ITAG>10. <T3>Sanctions: </T3>The Computer Matching Act specifies that neither aFederal nor a non-Federal agency may disclose a record for use in a matchingprogram if either has reason to believe the recipient is not meeting theterms of the matching agreement or the due process requirements of theComputer Matching Act. This provision does not create an affirmative dutyon the part of a source agency to investigate a recipient agency's levelof compliance. However, if a source agency receives information that wouldlead it to conclude that the recipient agency was not in compliance, itmust consult with that agency before continuing to participate in the matchingprogram.Moreover, it should be noted that the civil remedies provisions of thePrivacy Act are available to matching record subjects who can demonstratethat they have been harmed by an agency's violation of the Privacy Actor its own regulations. A successful litigant is entitled under the PrivacyAct to receive at least $1,000 and reasonable attorney's fees. Given thelarge numbers of record subjects typically involved in a matching program,agencies should be especially diligent in guarding against actions thatwould create liabilities.<ITAG tagnum="6">S.
