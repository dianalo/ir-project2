Manuel Antonio Noriega had no intention of killing him duringthe several hours they held him hostage, a participant told theMiami Herald.   The rebel, one of 42 Panamanians flown into Miami this weekafter seeking refuge at U.S. military bases in their homeland,spoke on condition that neither his name nor the location where hewas interviewed be disclosed, the newspaper said today. He said histroops knew him as Commander Thunder.   He suggested junior officers who took part in the coup attemptturned Noriega over to their superiors. He said the rebels had heldNoriega hostage for several hours last week and could have killedhim at any time.   ``There was no intention at any time to kill the man,'' the coupparticipant said.   Asked why, he said it may have been because a soldier would findit hard to execute his top commander.   ``It may have been their military discipline,'' he said.   In their public proclamations, the rebels said they had stagedthe coup to ``retire'' Noriega and five senior colonels of thePanamanian Defense Forces.   Among 42 exiles who arrived in Miami is Capt. Francisco Alvarez,who was arrested last year for taking part in a March 1988 coupattempt against Noriega. Alvarez reportedly was released from jailthree months ago.   The Washington Post reported another of those given refuge wasCapt. Javier Licona, believed to be the highest-ranking participantin the coup to escape capture.   One of the rebels in Florida said the soldiers feared for theirrelatives at home.   ``Noriega is a beast,'' the man said. ``He won't stop atanything. He's going to take reprisals against our wives, ourchildren and our parents back in Panama.''</TEXT></DOC>
