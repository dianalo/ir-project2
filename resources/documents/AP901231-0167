Phil Stoffey, the on-site cleanup coordinator for the statehealth department's Radiation Control Division, estimates it willtake Cotter 20 years to clean up the site under the remedial actionplan.   The company also faces a major lawsuit filed by Lincoln Parkresidents. In August 1989, their anger over what they believe is ahigh cancer rate and over Cotter's pollution problems spilled overinto a $550 million lawsuit filed in federal court in Denver. Thelawsuit claims uranium waste from the mill polluted the groundwater and was carried on the wind, causing damage to residents'health and property.   Nard Claar thinks Cotter was given too much leeway in how muchuranium waste it could discharge into the air - 30 tons per year.   ``What happens to that? It blows over my house and my neighbor'shouse,'' he says. ``To my knowledge, the Cotter Corp. didn't use usas guinea pigs. But with 30 tons of uranium being allowed, therewas a radioactive cloud over this valley.''   The state cancer register does not show an above-averageincidence of the disease among Fremont County residents, and thestate does not keep data on individual cities or neighborhoods.   State health officials say it is difficult to assess the cancerrisk from exposure to Cotter's uranium mill wastes.   ``It's long-range and low-level,'' says Ken Weaver of theRadiation Control Division. ``We're not talking about the kind ofradioactivity ... where spending a few hours or days in front ofthe uranium pile will cause cancer. It's the long-range, long-termeffects on health.''   A 1981 federal study found evidence of kidney damage in 29 menwho worked at Cotter. And a 1987 attorney general's report saidLincoln Park residents are ``receptors at risk'' if they drinkcontaminated water, eat food irrigated with contaminated water orgrown in contaminated soil, or inhale dust or radon from millsources.   The state in 1988 issued a warning that said Lincoln Parkresidents face a potential health risk by drinking watercontaminated by the mill. Many Lincoln Park residents got theirwater from wells whose water later was found to be contaminatedwith uranium and molybdenum, a byproduct of uranium processing.   While Lincoln Park residents press their concerns in court,opinion is more divided among other Canon City residents.   ``Everybody living in Fremont County is not cowering andconcerned that they will get cancer,'' says Pat Sherwood, executivedirector of the Canon City Chamber of Commerce. She says the mediahave implied that the entire community is concerned about becomingill, ``and it's just not true.''   Jack Rothfleisch, the Cotter mill manager who is supervising thesite cleanup, does not think the cancer rate is any higher inLincoln Park than anyplace else.   ``I think those people would have cancer if they were in themiddle of Nebraska, too,'' he says. ``As far as I'm concerned, Idon't think anybody has been harmed in any way by the exposure towhat we've done out here.''   Cotter officials would not discuss the lawsuit, but they werewilling to speak about the company's special relationship withCanon City.   ``The relationship of the Cotter Corp. with the community hasbeen a close, enduring one in which the company and the communityhave shared in some good times and some bad times,'' says JoeMcCluskey, Cotter vice president and general manager of thecompany's Lakewood office.   ``The company and its employees have always appreciated thesupport of the community, and, likewise, the community has enjoyedthe support of the Cotter Corp. over many years.''   Meanwhile, Sara Claar is seeking treatment in Denver for herundiagnosed illness. Nard and Sara say one of their greatestfrustrations is not knowing what they face.   ``I cannot say that Cotter made me sick,'' Mrs. Claar says.``But I'd like to know what did. We've never been able to get adefinite answer. Now, at least they're testing.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV Sunday Jan. 13</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
