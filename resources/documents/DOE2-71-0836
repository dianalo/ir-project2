<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-71-0836 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Aleph Event Builder is a 68020 based Fastbus master with a specialcoprocessor executing Fastbus transactions as a single assembly instructions.Keeping the original architecture, the hardware and firmware have recentlybeen upgraded to implement the new standard Fastbus calls. Full multi-user,multi-tasking support is provided to handle up to 16 concurrent environmentswithout the need of any software driver. Several application programscan execute Fastbus calls without intermediate software levels, eachone having a virtual Fastbus controller at his disposal. Environmentsare fully independent, both for execution of normal instructions andexception handling. No save/restore operation is necessary and the overheadfor context switching is reduced to zero because all multi-user aspectsare controlled directly in hardware at the coprocessor level. The performancefor multi-user Fastbus access has been greatly enhanced both in speedand simplicity.</TEXT></DOC>
