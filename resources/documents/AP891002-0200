The case accepted by the court, which poses the question ofwhether police officers may use checkpoints to spot drunkendrivers, presents the latest test of strength for the court's newlysolidified conservative majority.   Michigan courts struck down that state's sobriety checkpointprogram as an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, but courts inother states have upheld virtually identical police tactics.   In its usual start-of-term flurry, the court issued orders inmore than 1,000 cases _ denying review to most and agreeing tostudy 22. They will be among 150 or so disputes to be decided bythe end of the term in July.   The court also heard arguments in a Yonkers, N.Y. desegregationcase centering on four city councilmen who voted against a judge'sorder to pass a legislative package designed to lure subsidizedhousing to the city's white neighborhoods.   In addition to that civil rights case, the justices are lookingahead to a term in which they have agreed to decide thornyright-of-privacy arguments in three abortion disputes and the highcourt's first ``right to die'' controversy.   In other action on the first day of its term, the justices:   _Agreed to decide in an Illinois case whether public employersmay be forced to put aside partisanship when hiring, promoting andtransferring employees.   _Turned down the appeals of eight Mafia figures from New YorkCity convicted in the 1979 assassinations of crime chieftainCarmine Galante and two of his associates.   _Left intact Maryland's revocation of a $300,000-a-year taxbreak for a men-only golf club that has counted presidents andmembers of Congress among its members.   _Refused to spare an evangelical Christian group in Lenox,Mass., from having to return $5.5 million donated by a wealthyex-member.   _Rejected Alaska's attempt to forestall offshore oil and gasexploration in Bristol Bay. The state had argued that an oil spillthere could do more environmental harm than the massive ExxonValdez spill last March.   _Allowed states to criminally prosecute employers accused ofneglecting the health and safety of their employees. The justices,without comment, let stand a ruling in an Illinois case thatfederal workplace regulations do not bar such state prosecutions.   The use of police sobriety checkpoints in Michigan was attackedshortly after state police began using them in 1986. The programwas modeled after one used in Maryland.   At a checkpoint site, police directed all traffic headed in onedirection to a roadside area where officers checked motorists forsigns of intoxication.   If there was no immediate evidence of intoxication, the motoristwas given a traffic safety brochure and allowed to drive away. Theaverage delay was about 30 seconds.   If signs of intoxication were detected, a driver was directed toanother area for further questioning and perhaps a breath test.   At one such checkpoint, Michigan state police troopers checked126 vehicles in less than an hour and detained two drivers forsobriety field tests. One driver was arrested on drunken-drivingcharges.   The state police department was sued soon after the checkpointprogram began. The lawsuit alleged that the checkpoints violatedthe Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable police searches andseizures.   State courts banned the checkpoints, citing ``the potential foran unreasonable, subjective intrusion on individual libertyinterests.''   In defending the checkpoint program, Michigan Attorney GeneralFrank Kelley told the justices that fighting drunken driving is a``grave and legitimate public interest.''   He said Michigan's checkpoint program is valid even if it is notthe most effective police procedure available or may carry the``potential of generating fear and surprise in some motorists.''   Lawyers for those who successfully challenged the checkpointprogram urged the justices to reject the appeal.   They said the ``warrantless, suspicionless seizure'' of avehicle at a sobriety checkpoint could lead to drivers andpassengers being required to get out and being subjected topat-down searches. They said police officers may use such occasionsto inspect a vehicle's contents.   In other matters, the court:   _Agreed to use a Florida case to decide whether states mayprohibit grand jury witnesses from making public their owntestimony once the investigation has ended.   _Said it will decide whether the government may prohibitsoliciting on all Postal Service property, including the sidewalksadjacent to post office buildings.   _Left intact a $278,600 libel award against a Pawtucket, R.I.,newspaper by refusing to review a ruling that news stories may belibelous even if they contain no false statement.   _Turned down the appeal of eight antiwar activists, includingPhilip and Daniel Berrigan, who were convicted of breaking into aKing of Prussia, Pa., plant and damaging two nuclear missile cones.   _Agreed to decide in a California case whether lawyers who takecivil rights cases on a contingency basis may collect a big chunkof their clients' awards.   _Let stand the trespassing convictions of three people whoattempted to hand out anti-abortion booklets to students outside aTexas high school.   On the same day last July that the justices expanded stateauthority to make abortions harder to get, they also agreed tostudy disputes over abortion regulation in Minnesota, Ohio andIllinois.   Laws in Minnesota and Ohio require doctors to notify parents ofunmarried minors who seek an abortion.   An Illinois law would require abortion clinics, where theoverwhelming majority of abortions are performed, to provideservices and equipment now found only in hospitals. The law couldforce many clinics out of business and drive up the cost of anabortion by nearly $50.   The court also will decide whether a life-sustaining tube may beremoved from the stomach of a Missouri woman in an irreversiblevegetative state.   When Nancy Cruzan's parents requested that artificial feedingand hydration be ended for their daughter, hospital officialsrefused to do so without a court order. The Missouri Supreme Courtruled that the Cruzans, who say Nancy would prefer to die, have noright to order the termination of such treatment.</TEXT></DOC>
