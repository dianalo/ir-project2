Mohammed Mehdi, secretary-general of the National Council onIslamic Affairs, said Thursday the kidnapping of Sheik Abdul-KarimObeid worsened the prospects that the ``exceptionally bitter,exceptionally paranoid'' kidnappers will free the hostages.   ``They feel the right to retaliation is sacred, and anyquestioning of that is illegitimate,'' said Mehdi, who claims to bepossibly the only person in the United States who has met with thekidnappers in Beirut.   Obeid _ who is affiliated with Hezbollah, the pro-Iranianextremist group believed to sponsor hostage-holders _ was abductedfrom his home in south Lebanon July 28 by Israeli commandos. Israel,saying Obeid was involved in terrorism, has refused to free him.   The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimedJuly 31 it retaliated by hanging U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R.Higgins, who was abducted while on U.N. duty in Lebanon. U.S.officials said they believe Higgins was killed, but some reports saythe killing occurred months earlier.   Joseph Cicippio, one of the seven other U.S. hostages, wasthreatened with death, then given a reprieve.   Mehdi claims to have met with people responsible for holdingCicippio and Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent ofThe Associated Press, during a February 1987 visit to Beirut toappeal for the hostages' release.   He said he was led blindfolded to the meeting in a dimly lightedroom in Beirut. The captors he met with _ four men ranging in agefrom about 20 to 25 _ bore personal scars from the fighting inLebanon, Mehdi said.   The man who claimed to be in charge of holding Anderson, thelongest-held hostage who was kidnapped in 1985, said his entirevillage was destroyed by U.S. bombs dropped in retaliation for thebombing of the U.S. Marines' headquarters in Lebanon, when 241servicemen were killed.   ``He is so damn bitter he is ready to drop such shells on NewYork, on Washington,'' Mehdi said of Anderson's captor, who lost hiswife, children and grandparents when his village was bombed.   The captor responsible for holding Cicippio, who was kidnapped inSeptember 1986, told Mehdi his children had been burned by Americannapalm dropped from an American-made airplane piloted by an Israeli.Three of the captor's five children died, Mehdi said.   What Mehdi was told in Lebanon, however, does not entirely matchprevious accounts of the kidnappers or events surrounding theabductions.   The man holding Anderson has been described as a 38-year-oldLebanese Shiite, Imad Mugihniyah, who is driven by a desire to freerelatives held in Kuwait for attacks on U.S. and French facilitiesthere.   There was one U.S. bombing run following the destruction of theMarine headquarters and it was not reported to have destroyed anyvillages.   In the case of Cicippio, Israeli sources knowledgeable aboutIsrael's war in Lebanon say Israeli planes used napalm in a fewcases against strictly military targets belonging to Syria.   Mehdi said that although Americans consider the kidnappers to beterrorists, the kidnappers perceive themselves differently.   ``They said, `We are taking care of these people. Is thisterrorism, or is the burning of our children terrorism?'''   Mehdi said his attempts to persuade the kidnappers that theiractions violated Islamic law, that the taking of innocent hostageswas contrary to the faith's teachings on personal forgiveness andindividual responsibility, were ``a dead road.''   Mehdi, who is seeking a meeting with Secretary of State James A.Baker III, said the U.S. should pressure Israel to release Obeid tostart ``a chain of events to secure the release of the hostages.''   ``Sheik Obeid, to his group in southern Lebanon, is like thepope. And you do not kidnap the pope,'' said Mehdi. ``ColonelHiggins was a victim of this.''   The United States also should start trying to understand thesuffering that caused the kidnappers to take hostages, Mehdi said.   ``People are not born terrorists. Circumstances make them takesuch violent actions. If we don't bother to examine thosecircumstances, we will be denying ourselves the opportunity to solvea problem,'' Mehdi said.</TEXT></DOC>
