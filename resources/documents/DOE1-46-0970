The initial low fracture resistanceof the refractory is seen to be connected with the reordering of themicrostructure on account of recrystallization. A retardation of therecrystallization rate is found to take place with the introduction ofan aluminium hydroxychloride binder and alloying with magnesium oxide.Results are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
