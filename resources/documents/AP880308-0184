Assistant Attorney General William Weld said it is ``neitherlogical nor ... consonant with the notion of fair play'' to make ita crime for executive branch officials to accept fees or honorariafor job-related activities, while allowing members of Congress todo so.   In a National Press Club speech attacking public corruption,Weld said he favors ``raising the salary of all members of Congressto a level around somewhere between $150,000 and $175,000 a year.This would enable you to do some other things like prohibithonoraria.''   ``It would very, very expensive, and ... worth every penny,''said Weld, head of the department's criminal division.   Currently, congressional salaries are $89,500 a year, whichsenators may supplement with honoraria in an amount not to exceed40 percent of their salaries. The percentage for House members is30 percent.   ``At worst'' the payment and acceptance of fees and honoraria``can degenerate into a case of veiled extortion or a case ofveiled gratuity,'' Weld said.   Weld also said Congress should apply to itself the federalconflict-of-interest laws under which former White House politicaldirector Lyn Nofziger was convicted of illegal lobbying. Congresshas exempted itself from those laws.   Weld noted that while a member of Congress is free to lobby hisformer colleagues the day after he leaves office, ``as recentevents have made abundantly clear, such behavior by a former memberof the executive branch would land one in jail.''   Nofziger was found guilty of lobbying former White Houseassociates within one year after he left the government on mattersin which the agency had been substantially involved: a federalcontract for Wedtech Corp.; the continued production of A10anti-tank aircraft; and civilian manning of Navy ships. Nofzigerfaces sentencing later this month.   Weld rejected the suggestion that he was raising thecongressional ethics issue in an election year to overshadow thefact that a number of Reagan administration officials are undercriminal investigation or have been convicted of crimes.   Weld's boss, Attorney General Edwin Meese III, is under criminalinvestigation by an independent counsel.   ``My remarks today are the same as remarks I've been givingsince ... 1978 ... so it's no recently cooked-up farrago,'' Weldsaid. ``I'm speaking about legislation when I talk about doublestandard, not anybody's performance. I'm not saying one branch hasa monopoly on sleaze.''   Weld also expressed support for the 1978 Ethics in GovernmentAct under which independent counsels and the Office of GovernmentEthics police federal ethics laws in the executive branch. Theinvestigation of Meese was launched last May 11 under that law.   ``I like the Ethics in Government Act. I think it's a goodstatute'' and ``I think it deserves to be enforced,'' Weld said.   A former U.S. attorney in Boston, Weld said that when he came toWashington in 1986, he mistakenly thought a dozen congressmen mighthave broken the law when they accepted $2,000 fees in a visit to acommercial enterprise over which their committee had jurisdiction.   A deputy informed him ``that only members of the wicked andnefarious executive branch and independent agencies are prohibitedfrom supplementing their salaries,'' he recalled. ``That very sameaction ... would be a lay down criminal case if performed bysomebody in the executive branch.''   The congressmen justified taking the fees by saying theyexpected to be compensated for their time.   Compensation is the word used in the criminal statute, which``shows you how deep that double standard runs,'' said Weld.   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., agreed with Weld's suggestions,saying his House subcommittee will address the congressionalexemptions with proposed legislation.   Frank is chairman of the House judiciary subcommittee onadministrative law and governmental relations.   Honoraria and fees ``give both the appearance and in some casesthe reality of improper influence,'' Frank said. Regardingconflicts of interest, Frank said that when ``a one-timecolleague'' leaves Congress and ``next month is asking for a favor,personal feeling gets into it that's not legitimate.''</TEXT></DOC>
