Currently, the Hematite plant receives UF<T2>6</T2> and converts it to UO<T2>2</T2> powder. Most of the UO<T2>2</T2> powder is then shipped to the CE Windsor plant where it is fabricatedinto pellets. CE plans to relocate all pelletizing operations to the Hematiteplant. The proposed action includes the installation of two new pelletlines and startup testing with depleted uranium. After the startup testingis complete, CE plans to introduce enriched uranium into the pellet lines.The environmental assessment includes the evaluation of impacts from operationswith enriched uranium. The existing pellet line at Hematite will be maintainedfor special pellet runs.<T3>The Need For The Proposed Action: </T3>As part of a plan for its nuclearfuel fabrication program, CE plans to conduct all uranium pellet productionat its Hematite plant. In order to accomplish this relocation, CE plansto install new pellet production lines at the Hematite plant.<T3>Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action: </T3>The land intendedfor the new buildings is already committed for industrial use. The newbuildings replace buildings that were demolished. Thus, there will be nosignificant impact as a result of the construction of the new buildings.Addition of the new lines will not require any changes to the treatmentmethods for the liquid effluent streams. There will be a potential increasein the volume of liquid effluent. The volume of laundry water will increasein proportion to the number of new production personnel for the pelletlines. The laundry water is filtered, held in a storage tank, and sampledprior to release. The amount of liquid going to the sanitary water systemwill also increase in proportion to the number of new personnel. Traceamounts of radioactivity enter the system from sinks and showers. The controllimits for the liquid effluent radioactivity remain the same. The volumeincrease by approximately 20 percent. The impact from liquid dischargesis expected to be minimal.The main source of solid waste is from the solidification of liquid wasteend product from the recovery/recycle processes and mop water. These liquidwastes are heated and concentrated; the concentrate is solidified and putinto drums for transport to a commercial licensed disposal facility. Theincrease in solid waste is expected to be small and to cause an insignificantimpact.Air effluents from the existing oxide building and the recycle/recoverybuilding are not expected to increase. Effluent from the current pelletbuilding will decrease as the pellet production is moved to the new building.Effluents from the Windsor plant are also expected to decrease as the pelletproduction activities are relocated to the Hematite facility.Exhausts from the new pellet building are filtered through a double bankof HEPA filters. The exhaust air from the process areas is sampled continuouslyduring operations. CE has a current limit on total plant exhaust of 150microcuries per calendar quarter; this limit remains unchanged. CE's objectiveis to increase pellet production with no significant increase in the existingrates of effluent release. However, radioactive releases are expected toincrease. It it is conservatively assumed that the release doubles, thecritical organ dose to the nearest resident would only be 0.15 mrem/yrto the lung. An infant at the nearest residence would receive only 0.27mrem/yr to the lung. This is well below the 25 mrem permitted by 10 CFRPart 20, andSection; 20.105(c), which incorporates the provisions of EPA'sstandards in 40 CFR Part 190.<T3>Conclusion: </T3>Although there will be an increase in effluent, thestaff concludes that there will be no significant impacts associated withthe operation of the new pellet lines.<T3>Alternatives to the Proposed Action: </T3>Alternatives to the proposedaction include complete denial of CE's amendment application. This actionwould result in operations remaining unchanged. Another alternative wouldbe approval of only one new pellet line. Since impacts from the new operationare expected to be minor, neither of these alternatives offers any realbenefit.<T3>Agencies and Persons Consulted: </T3>In performing this assessment,staff utilized the environmental report dated March 29, 1989, and amendmentapplications dated March 22, and May 1, 1989.<T3>Finding of No Significant Impact: </T3>The Commission has preparedan Environmental Assessment related to the amendment of Special NuclearMaterial License No. SNM-33. On the basis of this assessment, the Commissionhas concluded that environmental impacts that would be created by the proposedlicensing action would not be significant and do not warrant the preparationof an Environmental Impact Statement. Accordingly, it has been determinedthat a Finding of No Significant Impact is appropriate.The Environmental Assessment and the above documents related to this proposedaction are available for public inspection and copying at the Commission'sPublic Document Room at the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,DC. Copies of the Environmental Assessment may be obtained by calling (301)492-3358 or by writing to the Fuel Cycle Safety Branch, Division of Industrialand Medical Nuclear Safety, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington,DC 20555.<ITAG tagnum="84">Opportunity for a Hearing</ITAG>Any person whose interest may be affected by the issuance of this amendmentmay file a request for a hearing. Any request for hearing must be filedwith the Executive Director for Operations, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, within 30 days of the publication of this noticein the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, and must comply with the procedures set forthin the Commission's regulation, 10 CFR Part 2, Subpart L, ``Informal HearingProcedures for Adjudications in Materials Licensing Proceedings.'' SubpartL of 10 CFR Part 2, which became effective March 30, 1989, was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 28, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 17th day of May, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Leland C.
