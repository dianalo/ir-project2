 Prior to its acquisition by the Racal Corporation, InterLan wasknown for its expertise in three products areas:andM;* PC LAN adaptor cardsandM;* Stand-alone communications systemsandM;* Inter-operability software productsandM;These product lines have all contributed to InterLan's strength in thedepartmental LAN marketplace, and the company has contributed several productinnovations that have advanced the performance and connectivity of the LANindustry itself.andM;Now Racal InterLan is part of the Racal Corporation's family of DataCommunications companies, and Racal InterLan has expanded its role to includeinter-networking technologies for enterprise-wide connectivity.andP;  INTERNExtrepresents this next generation of products.andP;  The first product to beintroduced under the INTERNExT name is the INX5000 Series CommunicationsSystem.andM;Figure 1 illustrates the evolution of Racal InterLan products from thedepartmental level to the facility level.andP;  Over time, Racal InterLan willfurther integrate its products with wide-area technologies from other Racalcompanies to address all three levels of the model.andM;The Trend Toward Structured WiringandM;INTERNExT (specifically the INX5000) is alos a response to the trend in theEthernet LAN marketplace toward structured wiring systems (SWSs).andP;  An SWStypically involves a hierarchical star wiring scheme using twisted-pair asthe primary distribution medium and fiber optics for the backbone network.andO;Figure 2 illustrates the basic model for an SWS.andM;Several wiring system specifications have been advanced by vendors andstandards groups.andP;  The most prevalent include:andM;* ATandamp;T Premise Distribution SystemandM;* IBM Cabling SystemandM;* EIA Commercial Building Wiring SpecificationandM;* Digital Equipment Corporation's DECconnectandM;Ironically, one of the most prevalent wiring systems conforms to nospecifications at all: the customer's in-place telephone wiring system.andP;  Inmany cases, existing voice-grade twisted-pair wiring is directly useable for10-Mbps LANs (this is subject to a thorough cable certification procedureconducted by a qualified installation company).andM;Structured wiring can claim several benefits over the traditional coaxial busaproach:andM;* An SWS can support multiple LAN technologies such as Ethernet, token-ringARCNET, asynchronous and synchronous data terminalsandM;* Fault isolation is easier and faster on a star-wired network than on alinear busandM;* The impact of network faults is often limited to a single user's linksegment rather than impacting multiple users commonly connected to a busnetworkandM;* In some cases, the cost of re-cabling the facility can be reduced oreliminated by using existing twisted-pair wiring for LANs.andM;According to Racal InterLan, these benefits are having a profound influenceon the LAN marketplace.andP;  A reduction in the use of coaxial-based technologyis occurring, while a proportionate growth in twisted-pair connections isunderway.andM;Vendors of twisted pair-based systems have enjoyed explosive growth as aresult of the market acceptance of structured wiring systems.andP;  Not that theIEEE standards body has finalized the specification for implementing Ethernetover twisted-pair (known as 10BASE-T), further expansion of this marketplaceaccompanied by a reduction in connection prices is expected (refer to Figure3).andM;The Impact On LAN EquipmentandM;According to Racal InterLan's crystall ball, the next generation of LANproducts will be designed to capitalize on the benefits of structured wiringsystems.andP;  One of the ways to realize the benefits of a star-wired topology iswith systems that are capable of high connection densities.andP;  As networkconnections continue to proliferate throughout an organization, as many as150 to 200 users may be serviced by a single wiring closet.andP;  Says RacalInterLan, its INX5000 will offer one of the highest connection densities inthe industry for 10BASE-T systems (a range of 12 to 156 ports).andP;  Connectiondensities for 10BASE-T are illustrated in Figure 4.andM;A high-density system can deliver excellent price per port.andP;  This is achievedby amortizing the cost of hardware and software components over a largernumber of users (or ports).andP;  This economy of scale also allows for a chassisdesign which must be extensible to ne technologies.andP;  In this emergingmarketplace, an evaluation of the communications from platform itself is animportant as the modules that occupy it.andM;A high connection density is really a function of the slot density of thechassis.andP;  A 12-port configuration has become the accepted port count for a10BASE-T module--becase 12 ports map conveniently to the number of wires in astandard telco feeder cable.andP;  Therefore, 25 pairs will service 12 users at 2pairs per station, with a single pair left over.andM;Given the rapidly declining costs of other LAN commodities such as adaptercards, transceivers, repeaters, and even the PC workstation itself, there isa tendency to view 10BASE-T systems as commodity products as well.andP;  In fact,there is a class of product available in the marketplace that deliversstand-alone 10BASE-T concentrator capabilities in the range of $100-$200 perport.andP;  However, another class of products that can be referred to asintegrated systems promises to deliver more values to the customer forper-port prices, in the range of $200-350 per port (these prices representlist price at maximum configuration).andM;The difference between these product categories can be measured qualitativelyin the following terms:andM;* The ability of the underlying platform to accommodate integratedtechnologies that offer a variety of LAN connection servicesandM;* The reliability of the components and the maintainability of the system(fault detection, isolation, and repair)andM;* The level of network management provided and the ability to deploy andadminister large installations containing mixed vendor equipmentandM;The Integration of TechnologiesandM;In addition to providing high 10BASE-T densities, the 13 available slots inthe INX5000 provide space for integrating complementary technologies withougeliminating the cost advances.andP;  Racal InterLan has chosen the terminal serveras one of the first complementary technologies to be integrated with10BASE-T.andM;Together, 10BASE-T and terminal servers offer the following advantages:andM;* Both services utilize twisted-pair for connecting the desktop to thenetwork interfaceandM;* Most organizations employ both terminals and PCs (or workstations) for therange of end-users on their corporate networks (see Figure 5)andM;* Even where a transition from terminals to PCs is taking place, therecontinues to be a need for asynchronous servers to accommodate printers,modems, non-Ethernet host systems, and existing data-switch equipment.andM;* Once either form of service is cost-justivied (10BASE-T or terminalservice), the other can be added for the price of the line card aloneandgt;eliminating the cost of a separate platform can be a considerable savings(refer to Figure 6)andM;The INX5000 also incorporates a fiber-optic (FOIRL) interface as well asseveral new modules which are planned for release in the next 12-24 months.andO;To summarize: the importance of sufficient slot capacity in a communicationschassis is its ability to reach economies of scale and to support theconvergence of new technologies in the system.andM;Reliability And MaintainabilityandM;Systems designed for structured wiring must pay special attention to theissues of reliablity and maintainability.andP;  The large populations of end-users(50-200) which may be serviced by a single system call for a chassis designwhich is:andM;* Designed with high-reliablity componentsandM;* Tolerance of system faults and /or module faultsandM;* Easy to diagnose and repairandM;In combination, these three characteristics minimize system downtime andoptimize the efficiency of the network.andP;  The INX5000 series has been designedwith each of these criteria in mind.andM;The components used in the system are highly reliable, and individual modulescarryandM;an MTBF rating of over 40,000 hours.andP;  The mid-plane design segregates most ofthe active components onto a replaceable Logic Module.andP;  Parts which aresusceptible to dust or mechanical faults--such as diskette drives--are notused.andP;  Instead, software storage is provided on Featurecards that employ 512Kof EPROM storage.andM;Several product engineering features may contribute to fault tolerance.andP;  TheINX5000 eliminates a central retiming module for 10BASE-T.andP;  A centralizedrepeater function in a system that will service a hundred or mor e users is acritical point of dependency for the system.andP;  The INX5000 performs the fullcomplement of IEEE 802.3 repeater functions on-board each module in thesystem.andM;The use of redundancy is an important method for improving system faulttolerance.andP;  The INX5000 has a redundant power feature which provides a hotfail-over to the secondary power supply in the event of a primary failure.andO;This switch-over is performed transparently to end-user sessions.andM;Other examples of component redundancy on the INX5000 include a back-up AUIinterface to the backbone and a back-up network management module.andP;  Relativeto operating software (for the management module and the terminal servermodule), the INX5000 has the ability to boot its executable images over thenetwork from a central management station from another INX5000 system, orlocally from a resident Featurecard with the code in non-volatile EPROMstorage.andM;After reliability and fault tolerance comes the issue of fault isolation andrepair.andP;  Again, the INX5000 has designed-in capabilities to minimize themean-time to repair.andP;  On-board diagnostics, environmental sensors,automatically generated alarms (posted locally and to an SNMP managementstation), and port-level statistics are some of the tools available to thenetwork manager or support personnel.andP;  Making this data accessible to anumber of devices--including the integral LCD control panel, a remoteX-terminal, or a SUN workstation--allows the repair person to examine thenetwork from the closet, the central station, or points in between.andM;Network ManagementandM;The network management capabilities of local-area networks that utilize the10BASE-T standard have become a critical selection factor for writingconcentrator equipment.andP;  The reason for the heightened awareness surroundingnetwork management is the important role it plays in the isolation ofequipment faults and the rapid recovery from network outages that is madepossible by a sophisticated management capability.andM;Network management can vary dramatically from vendor to vendor.andP;  While onesupplier may refer to a PC-based display of read-only statistics as a&quot;Network Management System,&quot; another will be referring to a high-endworkstation with relational database management and bit-mapped graphics.andP;  Itis therefore important for the buyer to understand what he/she wants from aprospective management system before selecting a 10BASE-T management system.andM;One can think of two distinct classes of management when considering theday-to-day operational support of a medium- to large-scale 10BASE-Tinstallation.andM;Chassis management is a term that can be used to describe the localadministration of the wiring concentrator once it has been physicallyinstalled in the communication closet.andP;  Chassis (local) management isimportant as a seperate activity, because total reliance on a centralizedmanagement station can complicate the process of installing and maintaining achassis.andP;  Furthermore, some customers with smaller networks may not be readyfor a centralized system at all: in this case, local or Chassis Management isan important stepping-store on the way to a more comprehensive system downthe road.andM;Chassis Management functions can include the following activities:andM;* Local interpretation of 10BASE-T module statusandM;* Local display of statistical dataandM;* Local control of diagnostic routines and their resultsandM;* Local system configuration chargesandM;In contrast, network management is used to describe the management of thenetwork and all of its subscribers.andP;  As such, its architecture should includethe use of open protocols and data structures to facilitate the support ofmulti-vendor networks.andP;  The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) andrelated definitions for a Management Information Base (MIB) are the primarytools being employed by vendors and users toward this end (see Figure 7).andM;Network management functions should include the following activities:andM;* Configuration of all SNMP network objects (vendor-independent)andM;* Remote control of device operational statesandM;* Interactive topology map of all reporting equipmentandM;* Central down-line load of operating softwareandM;* Periodic data collection of all activity, error, and status variablesandM;* Event reporting of threshold violations or unsolicited equipment alarms.andM;Racal InterLan incorportes both forms of management in its INTERNExT productfamily.andP;  Chassis management is provided by a Chassis Management Module (CMM).andO;The CMM is responsible for all stand-alone system administration functionssuch as initial installations, re-configuration, and remedial maintenance.andM;There is also an optional Network Management Module (NMM) that serves as theSNMP agent for the INTERNExT system.andP;  The NMM inter-operates with allSNMP-complaint managers, including the Racal InterLan LANcentral ExpressManagement Station.andP;  This option gives the INTERNExT customers SNMPmanagement capabilities.andP;  All standard MIB variables (as well as severalextensions) are accessible for read/write operations by an SNMP manager.andM;The Economics of Wire-Closet SystemsandM;The selection of a communications system for structuring wiring applicationsrequires an investigation of the cost factors and the system functionality.andO;While both areas are of equal importance, some customers weigh theirdecisions more heavily in one direction or the other.andP;  Applications that arevery price-sensitive and smaller in scale may be more suited to a low-costcommodity concentrator.andP;  Larger networks with mission-critical applicationsand a need for multiple services in the hub will be more attracted by theintegrated system level products.andM;The best yardstick for comparing a high-density multi-port product is toestablish its price per connection over the range of port densities thecustomer's wire closets can support.andP;  An additional allocation for expansionports should be factored into this estimate to provide the network with &quot;roomto grow.&quot;andM;The graph in Figure 8 is a comparison of the price per connection for theleading suppliers of 10BASE-T system-level products, provided by RacalInterLan.andP;  The vendors compared all provide modularity, fault tolerance, andnetwork management features in thei products.andP;  Each vendor offers a differentrange of port densities in a chassis.andP;  As a result, the price per connection&quot;spikes&quot; upward at the point where a second chassis is required to satisfythe port count.andP;  Racal InterLan boasts that only the INX5000 can support arange of over 150 users with a single chassis.andM;Figure 9 is a similar graph comparing the connection costs for high-densityterminal server systems.andP;  Unlike the 10BASE-T systems, high-density terminalservers have more differences between vendors in the areas of modularity,fault tolerance, and network management.andP;  There are also significantdifferences in the port density per module and the resulting price perconnection among these products.andP;  Racal InterLan claims the INX5000 has thesmoothest progression of price per connection across more than 200 ports ofterminal connections.andM;Another benefit of the high port densities available in the INX5000 is theability to accomodate high volumes of both terminal and PC connections in thesame chassis.andP;  Once a chassis is installed in the writing closet, additionalconnections may be installed at the price of the module alone--typically lessexpensive than stand-alone products.andM;ConclusionandM;Racal InterLan is right on target in focusing on high-density structuredwiring system products.andP;  It is also correct in noting that twisted-pair cableis becoming the media of choice--largely because of the multiple media accessmethod support provided.andP;  The only problems is that InterLan competitors suchas Cabletron, SynOptics, and Ungermann-Bass have had similar products on themarket for over a year.andP;  This will make InterLan's job a difficult one.andP;  Ofcourse, if it can supply equal or greater functionality than the competitionat a lower price, it will be successful.andM;For further information on INTERNExT, contact Racal InterLan at 155 SwansonRd., Boxborough, MA 01719andgt;
