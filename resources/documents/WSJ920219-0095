Pessimism over the agreement and OPEC's ability to abideby it lopped $1.34 a barrel off March crude in futurestrading on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday. Theexchange had been closed Monday because of the Presidents'Day holiday in the U.S., but trading in London on Mondayresulted in similar declines.</LP><TEXT>   The accord moves the group's production ceiling down toabout 23 million barrels a day from 24.2 million, but manymarket participants expected an even lower ceiling. Severalmembers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesactually sought a lower ceiling during last week's fractiousmeeting. &quot;Many wanted no more than 22.5 million&quot; barrels aday, said Indonesia's oil minister, Ginandjar Kartasasmita.The minister said the 23 million barrel pact was the best thegroup could accomplish.   But the market's bearishness was compounded by the strongsense that some OPEC members, most notably Saudi Arabia, seemprepared to flout even the 23 million barrel ceiling. SaudiArabia said it will reduce its daily crude output to eightmillion barrels from about nine million barrels, even thoughthe production agreement allocates 7,887,000 barrels to theSaudis.   Taking into account the Saudi production plan and thelikelihood of more output from Kuwait, Peter Beutel ofPegasus Econometric Group figures OPEC will be producing 23.6million barrels at the very least while demand is pegged at22.5 million barrels.   &quot;The market is looking at this initial 1.1 million barrela day surplus with a great deal of trepidation,&quot; Mr. Beutelsaid. And, he continued, it is still &quot;unresolved what happenswhen Iraq comes back, and will others cheat? Those fears willcontinue to have a negative effect on prices.&quot;   OPEC officials said they would consider additional cuts ifenergy markets reacted negatively to the production agreementover the next month. The group's oil ministers scheduled anApril 24 meeting in Vienna to analyze the agreement's effect.   March crude finished at $18.12 a barrel in trading deemedheavy despite the absence of many traders who are attendingthe annual round of industry meetings in London known as IPweek. Outer months were sharply lower, as well. Several U.S.refiners, led by Sun Co., slashed the posted price they willpay for crude oil.   Futures prices for petroleum products took a tumble, aswell, following the sharp slide in crude. Heating oil wasalso affected by unseasonably warm weather throughout much ofthe U.S.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Wheat futures prices plunged asspeculators and commodity funds liquidated their positionsbecause of weather forecasts favorable to the developingcrop. Last Friday, forecasters were predicting that arcticair would descend into the wheat-growing regions of thePlains states, possibly damaging hard and soft red winterwheat crops. However, as traders came back yesterday from theholiday weekend, expectations had shifted to warm and moistconditions, which would be good for the young crop. Agovernment field survey for Illinois released after tradingyesterday showed that 31% of the state's wheat crop is listedin poor condition. Commodity funds -- organized pools ofinvestor money -- were big sellers yesterday, particularly ofthe nearterm March contract, which declined 15.50 cents to$4.115 a bushel. Meanwhile, corn and soybean futures pricesgot a boost from a request for an additional $600 million inexport credits from Russian President Boris Yeltsin, saidDaniel W. Basse, market research director for AgResource Co.,Chicago. The republic would be expected to use such creditsto buy feed grains, including corn and soybeans. The May corncontract rose one cent to $2.7150 a bushel, and the Marchsoybean contract rose four cents to $5.7250 a bushel.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Silver for March delivery tumbled 10cents an ounce to $4.058. Yesterday's selling was largelybased on technical factors, said George Milling-Stanley,precious metals analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. IanMacDonald, vice president at Credit Suisse in New York, addedthat the strong dollar also contributed to the decline. Theplunge in oil prices was perceived as negative for silverbecause it means less money available to Middle Easterninvestors to buy precious metals, he said. Silver had risenon expectations of an economic recovery recently but therally came too early, Mr. MacDonald said. Over the next week,silver prices will probably fall back to the $4 level, hepredicted. Mr. Milling-Stanley said he expects to seeindustrial demand for silver picking up in a few months, butbefore that happens, prices may weaken on more speculativeselling.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices rose sharply. Sugar for Marchdelivery gained 0.56 cent a pound to settle at 8.58 cents.Sandra Kaul, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said therise was triggered by reports that only four of 95 sugarmills in Russia are operating, leading traders to speculatethat the republic would buy additional sugar in the spotmarket. That speculation triggered a short-covering rally,she said. Traders cover their short positions, or bets theprice will fall, by buying offsetting contracts. Prices mayrise a little more on follow-through buying, she said. Butample supplies still available from such countries asThailand, Brazil, and India should damp any further pricestrength in sugar, she said.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Futures prices fell to their lowest levels since1975. After trading as low as 66.45 cents a pound, coffee forMarch delivery settled at 66.70 cents, down 2.40 cents.Melissa Trout, an analyst at Cargill Investor Services, saidtraders construed as negative for coffee prices a speech by aU.S. trade official at the National Coffee Associationconvention in Boca Raton, Fla., yesterday. The officialemphasized that the U.S. supports free trade, which castdoubt on prospects for a return to an internationalprice-support system, she said. Also hurting prices was talkthat large importing and trading companies were planningheavy deliveries against the March contract, which reinforcedthe bearish sentiment, she said. Prices will probably remainwithin a range of 60 to 70 cents over the next couple ofmonths, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
