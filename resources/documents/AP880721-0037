Dr. Neal L. Benowitz, a UC professor of medicine and chief ofpharmacology at San Francisco General Hospital, said his study mayeven underestimate the amount of nicotine absorbed in thebloodstream because some users of chewing tobacco and snuff keep itin their mouths for hours.   A half-ounce chunk of tobacco kept in the mouth for an hour orso could cause as much absorption of nicotine as eight to ninecigarettes, Benowitz said Wednesday.   His report is based on measurements of smokeless tobacco madeduring a four-day study involving 10 volunteers. It is beingpublished in the July issue of the Clinical Phamacology andTherapeutics journal.   Nicotine is the most addictive chemical in tobacco and has beenlinked to such health dangers as increased blood pressure and heartrate, as well as damage of blood vessel walls.</TEXT></DOC>
