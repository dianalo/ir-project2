Congressional aides said that Sens. William Proxmire (D., Wis.) and James Sasser (D., Tenn.) are prepared to seek to deny the SEC funds to enforce the proposed rule during the coming fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. Meanwhile, in a letter to the SEC, Sen. Jake Garn (R., Utah) strongly objected to the rule, which would prohibit the stock markets from listing companies that have nullified or reduced the voting rights of certain shareholders after May 15, 1987. Some companies have done this as an anti-takeover measure.    Just as Sen. Proxmire had in an earlier letter, Sen. Garn warned SEC Chairman David Ruder that the proposed rule would pre-empt the right of states to regulate shareholder voting rights. He also objected to the rule's retroactive nature, saying it would be &quot;patently unfair&quot; to companies that made voting-rights &quot;adjustments&quot; after the May 15 cutoff.    Aides to Sen. Proxmire said the lawmaker, who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, hopes the Senate will be able later this week to take up legislation designed to curb corporate takeovers. Last December, when the banking committee approved the legislation by a 14-6 vote, it decided against mandating one-share, one-vote. The bill, however, would direct the SEC to study the impact of existing stock-exchange rules on &quot;corporate suffrage&quot; and to report back by next October. </TEXT></DOC>
