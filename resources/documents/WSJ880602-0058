Malott, chairman and chief executive officer, said.    The Saudi Arabian sale opens up several new potential markets for the Bradley, said Mr. Malott. Another FMC source said the company believes that other Middle Eastern nations may place orders, some of them financed by the Saudis. The Saudi Bradleys are scheduled for delivery in 1990.    &quot;Given conditions in that part of the world, some other countries are going to want these when they see them,&quot; said James A. McClung, vice president, international.    The Bradley vehicles, which cost $1.5 million each, are equipped with surface-to-surface rocket launchers and 25mm cannons. The Saudi order also covers spare parts and service. The Saudi Bradleys, roughly 200 of them, will be air-conditioned for desert use. &quot;It's the Mercedes Benz of its type,&quot; Mr. Malott said in an interview.    Until now, FMC's customer list was limited to the Pentagon, which has purchased about 3,400 of the weapons since the early 1970s. Other countries had purchased similar weapons, usually from competing manufacturers in Britain, France and West Germany. FMC officials long have complained that government officials in those countries play an aggressive role in marketing their industries' war machinery.    Mr. Malott disclosed yesterday that the Pentagon has raised its goal for eventual Bradley purchases to 7,900 from 6,882. Some military critics have challenged the Bradley's capabilities, branding the vehicle a &quot;firetrap.&quot; But Mr. Malott said the Pentagon's higher ceiling on purchases and the Saudi transaction will give the Bradley's reputation a boost.    Until now, FMC's foreign sales of armored vehicles have been limited to smaller, less sophisticated models: the M113 troop carrier and the Armored Infantry Fighting Vehicle. Last week FMC signed a $1 billion joint-venture contract to produce certain of the smaller vehicles for the Turkish government.    FMC, which also has interests in petroleum equipment, agricultural machinery and industrial chemicals, said its marketing push in armored vehicles has helped boost international sales to roughly one-third of its overall business. FMC sales in 1987 totaled $3.14 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
