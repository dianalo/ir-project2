London share prices were near the day's low at the close as renewed concern about Wall Street killed the market's early rally.    The Financial Times 30-share index closed off 7.5 points at 1398.1. Volume was a moderate 434.3 million shares, up from 397.4 million shares a day earlier. The 100-share index was off 8.2 points at 1756.9.    The morning rally came on the strength of previous rises in New York and Tokyo and the dollar's firmness overnight. The rises produced some healthy buying interest in the London market, dealers said.    &quot;In the morning we saw a good amount of two-way business,&quot; said a dealer at the brokerage Phillips andamp; Drew.    But the rally evaporated around midday as rumors began to spread that Wall Street would open lower. And when New York in fact opened firmer, the London market failed to reverse its earlier losses.    Dealers attributed the lack of reaction to lingering fear that another fall on Wall Street might take place after the London market closed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 11.11 around the time the London market closed, but ended more than 20 points lower for the day.    Major exporting stocks were hurt by sterling's continued rise. Imperial Chemical Industries was off 10 pence at 994 pence ($18.50), Glaxo Holdings fell 5 pence to #10.02 and B.A.T Industries dropped 4 to 422.    British Aerospace was actively traded, as participants continued to assess the impact of its planned takeover of Rover Group and the company announced its 1987 results.    British Aerospace announced a pretax loss of #159 million for 1987, compared with a pretax profit of #182 million the previous year. Its stock fell 15 to 397, with 12 million shares changing hands.    Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange closed narrowly mixed in sluggish trading.    The day-earlier rally lasted through morning trading, when brokers cited solid demand for blue-chip issues in the wake of gains on Wall Street and a firmer dollar. But the market ran out of steam around midday as most investors returned to the sidelines ahead of the Easter holiday weekend.    By the end of the session, most shares had settled back to Tuesday's closing levels. But price movements were random, as traders ignored corporate news and had few other factors to act on, brokers said.    In the automobile sector, Daimler-Benz dropped 7 marks to 641 ($384), while Bayerische Motoren Werke rose 3 to 504. Volkswagen continued to hover just above the 238-mark issuing price of the recent placement of the government's 16% stake. The share inched up 0.7 mark to 240.5.    Deutsche Bank firmed 1 to 407 after the bank announced a 37% drop in 1987 group net income. Dresdner Bank added 1 to 241, while Commerzbank was flat at 228.    Elsewhere, stocks closed higher in Amsterdam, Stockholm and Milan, mixed in Zurich and Brussels and lower in Paris.    Among Pacific markets, share prices closed higher in Taipei, Sydney, Singapore and Wellington, were mixed in Hong Kong and Manila and lower in Seoul.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
