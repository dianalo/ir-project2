The marked increase in resolution seen in the MIspectra is accompanied by substantial frequency shifts from the peaksin the vapor-phase spectra. The spectra were generated with a gas chromatographic/matrixisolation/Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, with the use of frozenAr at 13 K as the isolating matrix. The spectra of the 22 isomers oftetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin show that each isomer can be distinguishedand quantitated at the nanogram level. In addition, preliminary quantitativedata were obtained for the pesticides TerbufosX and FonfosX. Finally,a problem with a previously published spectrum of C-13 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxinwas uncovered, and it was shown that the spectrum was actually that ofC-13 2,3,7-trichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.</TEXT></DOC>
