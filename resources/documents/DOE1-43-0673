A number of locations were chosen for more detailedstudy and by June 1981 three sites had been selected. Data collectionat all three sites was underway by early Sept. 1981. Data was collectedat each site in order to assess its suitablility for the installationof a large vertical axis wind turbine (project AEOLUS). The variableof primary interest in wind energy resource evaluation is the mean windspeed at the center of the swept area of the proposed turbine, whichwill probably be approximately 60 m. The data tentatively confirm priorestimates that Fonderie would have the highest winds of the three sites.The September and October averages are also not too far from estimatesbased on normals from nearby climate stations coupled with rather subjectivelydetermined transfer functions. From the annual distribution of theseestimates, September values are expected to be between 5 and 10% belowthe annual average while October should be close to it. Given this thereseems no reason to modify the estimates of annual average 50 m wind speedsat the three sites at present. 5 refs., 10 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
