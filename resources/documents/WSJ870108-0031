Some actively traded Treasury bonds advanced by almost 3/4 of a point, or nearly $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Helping fuel the rally was a decline in short-term interest rates and a rise in the U.S. dollar's value against European currencies.    Traders and dealers &quot;are becoming increasingly confident that interest rates will decline further,&quot; said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Irving Securities Inc. He predicted that the Federal Reserve will reduce its discount rate to 5% from 5 1/2% before the end of March to try to bolster economic activity. The rate is the fee the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions.    Lower interest rates are needed to keep the economy from slumping, Mr. Braverman contended, saying there is &quot;a clear and present danger of recession.&quot; He predicted the economy won't grow at all this quarter and may even contract.    David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International Inc., said he expects the economy to perform &quot;quite poorly&quot; this quarter and next, partly because the new tax law is likely to discourage construction spending. He predicted that the gross national product will expand at only a 0.7% annual rate this quarter and at a 1.7% pace in the second quarter. That would compare with an estimated growth rate of 2.7% in last year's second half.    Slow growth in West Germany and Japan could add to the economic woes in the U.S. by damping demand for U.S. goods, Mr. Resler said.    &quot;The greatest worry is whether the world will find itself in a recession,&quot; he said.    The West German economy expanded a meager 2.5% last year, that nation's Federal Statistics Office reported yesterday, compared with the Bonn government's forecast of 3%. A deterioration in the outlook for West German exports has prompted the German Institute for Economic Research to reduce its forecast for West Germany's economic growth this year to 1.5%.    &quot;It's only a matter of time&quot; before the West German central bank reduces interest rates, Mr. Braverman said, as that nation's economy is &quot;weak and will become weaker.&quot;    Nomura's Mr. Resler predicted that Federal Reserve officials will move aggressively to prevent &quot;further deterioration&quot; of the U.S. economy. He said the Fed will cut its discount rate to 5% as early as next month and follow that reduction with another, to 4 3/4% or 4 1/2%, in April or May. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, now more than 7 1/4%, will fall to about 6 1/2% by midyear, he predicted.    Some sectors of the U.S. economy seemed to show strength last month. For example, automobile makers yesterday reported that car sales soared in the final 10 days of December. Analysts said the sales mainly reflected a rush by consumers to beat the new tax law, which took effect at the start of the year and eliminated many deductions for interest charges on purchases.    The government is scheduled to release December employment figures tomorrow. Economists generally expect those figures to show that the number of workers on non-farm payrolls rose by between 200,000 and 225,000 last month after a rise of 249,000 in November. They also expect the civilian unemployment rate to be unchanged at 7%.    &quot;Taken alone, the employment numbers should look good,&quot; Mr. Resler said. But they &quot;might be the last gasp of employment strength for some time,&quot; he said, noting that many large companies already have announced layoffs to take effect early this year.    In the credit markets yesterday, the Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 rose to 102 15/32 from 101 3/4 Tuesday. That lowered the yield to 7.30% from 7.35%. The price of the government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 increased to 101 3/4 from 101 1/4, cutting the yield to 7% from 7.07%.    Among short-term securities, the rate on the Treasury's latest 13-week Treasury bills fell to 5.42% bid from 5.49% Tuesday. The bid on the latest 26-week issue declined to 5.47% from 5.51%.    The interest rate on federal funds hovered between 6% and 6 1/4% for most of yesterday. That was down from an average rate of 6.56% Tuesday and 6.86% Monday. Federal funds are reserves that banks lend each other. The funds rate has been unusually high in recent weeks because of special year-end factors.    On the corporate front, a $250 million issue of Chase Manhattan Corp. notes was offered to investors through underwriters led by First Boston Corp. The 7 7/8% notes were priced at 99.90 to yield 7.89% to maturity in 10 years. They are rated double-A-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Another group led by First Boston offered a $200 million issue of Union Pacific Corp. debentures. The 8 1/2% sinking-fund debentures were priced at 97.875 to yield 8.70% to maturity in 2017. The issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody's and single-A-plus by Sandamp;P. </TEXT></DOC>
