His interest in communicating with the deaf has helped Levin nabsuspects and even a wife, a deaf woman he met while investigatinghouse vandalism.   ``I never caught the offender,'' he says. ``I just caught thevictim.''   That meeting 12 years ago launched Levin's career as asign-language police officer, working with deaf victims anddefendants in a city with an estimated 26,000 deaf people.   ``Dan is invaluable,'' said Diana Thorpe, president of theIllinois Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf. ``Can I underlinethat? Fourteen zillion times? Anything from a parking ticket tomurder, all you have to say is, `Go see Dan Levin.'''   Representatives of deaf organizations in Chicago, New York, LosAngeles and Washington, D.C., say they know of no other certifiedsign interpreter in the country who also works as a police officer.   Like many police officers, Levin once worked a beat car, but henow works out of police headquarters where he uses a speciallyequipped telephone with a typewriter keyboard to take calls fromdeaf crime victims.   His abilities helped solve the murder of deaf woman, LindaSanborn, whose body was found in her apartment. Her specialtelephone for the deaf, a video game and household items weremissing.   Investigators later learned that four deaf people had discussedthe woman's death days before her body was found in November 1987.   Officers called in Levin to interpret for a deaf witness, whocould remember only the first name, Danny, of one of those whodiscussed the woman's death.   Levin had had contact several times with a Danny Lord, and two ofthe incidents involved burglaries. Police found Lord, who laterconfessed to the killing.   Because Levin was able to advise Lord of his rights in sign,Lord's attorney was unable to attack the confession in later incourt. Lord could get the death penalty when he is sentencedWednesday.   ``I thought I'd be able to attack the credibility of theinterpreter,'' said Assistant Public Defender James Mullenix. ``Butafter talking to two certified court interpreters and a private guy,they all said the same thing; `Dan Levin is an excellentinterpreter.' It was unfortunate for us.''   By night, Levin has interpreted a class for a hearing-impairedmedical student, related the ``bedside chats'' of doctors to deafpatients, served as courtroom interpreter for deaf witnesses, andtranslated therapy sessions for adolescent psychiatric patients.   The extra money is helpful. Levin and his wife have two children,ages 2 and 4. The children are not deaf, but they are learning sign.   ``I feel I have the best of both worlds,'' he said. ``It's verybroadening to me individually. It's rewarding. I feel I'm lucky tobe in this position. Sometimes, I can hardly believe it myself.''   It all began in 1977, when Levin volunteered to help a deaf womanwhose home was being pelted repeatedly by rocks.   Levin had remembered some finger-spelling from his boyhood, whenhe watched his best friend converse in sign language with his deafparents. So he agreed to put the home of Janice Roberts on specialpatrol.   On his second visit to the house, he asked Ms. Roberts for a bookon sign language.   ``After a couple of months, I thought I learned enough signlanguage to aske her out,'' Levin said. About three years later,they were married.   ``I was intrigued,'' Levin said. ``She seemed to have a nicequality about her. I don't know how else to describe it. Somethingclicked.''</TEXT></DOC>
