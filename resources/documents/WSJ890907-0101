The researchers say the virus, into which they engineered the insects' own water-regulating genes, infects only moths. Under normal conditions, these genes produce hormones that regulate the level of water in the insects' body. But infection with the altered virus causes overproduction of these hormones, killing the insects in about a week.    Larry Keeley, one of the researchers, says the group is experimenting with two water-regulating genes. One governs the insects' ability to eliminate water, and the other controls water retention. Depending upon the gene, the virus can be used either to dehydrate the insects or to &quot;drown&quot; them.    Mr. Keeley says gene-carrying viruses could be used to attack at least two dozen critical physiological processes in insects that are regulated by hormones.    He says viral insecticides can be formulated into liquids and sprayed on crops, targeting such pests as the cotton bollworm, corn earworm and tobacco budworm. But, he adds, commercialization may be five to 10 years away.    Mysterious PQQ May Be    An Essential Vitamin    RESEARCHERS at the University of California at Davis have identified a possible new vitamin that may enhance development of skin, blood vessels and ligaments.    The compound known as pyrroloquinoline quinone, or PQQ, is part of a mammalian enzyme that facilitates growth of animal and human connective tissue. The vitamin-like compound, found in major organs, also occurs in fruits and vegetables. PQQ was discovered in 1979 as an &quot;enzyme-helper&quot; for a number of enzymes in bacteria. But it hasn't been clear whether this compound is produced by an animal cell or acquired from an external source. The new evidence suggests it may be the latter.    The researchers fed pregnant mice and rats a PQQ-deficient diet and found that 20% to 30% of their offspring lacked the compound. Moreover, they had poor skin texture, hair loss and hunched posture. The symptoms were corrected when PQQ was restored to their diet.    Robert Rucker, one of the researchers, says the experiment indicates that PQQ might be a vitamin, a nutrient that the body can't synthesize and for which it depends on external sources. &quot;What we have demonstrated is the nutritional importance of the compound,&quot; he says.    He says humans don't run the risk of PQQ deficiency because almost all foods they consume have the compound. But understanding the compound could lead to &quot;drugs that would be able to control the rate of wound healing,&quot; he says. &quot;There are situations where you want the wound to heal quickly, and some where you want to slow it down to minimize scar formation.&quot;    He says PQQ's presence in high concentrations in adrenal glands also &quot;suggests its involvement in synthesis and regulation of adrenal hormones&quot; and the possibility that the compound has additional applications.    Recycling Garbage    Into Garbage Bags    POTATO PEELS and other food wastes are grist for biodegradable plastic, according to scientists at Argonne National Laboratory.    Environmental problems have spurred development of plastics that disintegrate in sunlight or on exposure to moisture in soil. A majority of such plastics have involved bonding corn starch molecules to petroleum-based polymers. But such bonds aren't strong, and the final product generally is too weak for such uses as garbage and shopping bags.    Now, Argonne researchers say they have overcome the weakness problem by using lactic acid, derived from vegetable mass. Researcher Robert Coleman says degradable plastic can be made entirely with lactic acid, or by combining 90% to 95% lactic acid with petroleum-based polymers.    He says researchers extracted starch from potato peels, converted it into glucose and fermented glucose into lactic acid. The lactic acid was then condensed into polylactic acid, which produced the physical properties needed to make plastic products of various shapes.    Sensitive Home Alarm    Can 'Hear' Burglars    RENSSELAER Polytechnic Institute researchers have developed computerized home alarms that can recognize certain sounds and ignore others. These devices, 10 inches long and four inches wide, have high-speed microprocessors and are &quot;trained&quot; by large computers to pick, say, the sound of breaking glass out of a jumble of interfering sounds. Once installed, the small processors fine-tune themselves. They store additional signals from the environment that they want to recognize or ignore, much as humans develop recognition patterns, says Michael Savic, associate professor of electrical engineering, who heads the research group. As a result, he says, the devices learn to recognize the breaking sound of specific types of glass they're monitoring.    Programming computers to pick up well-defined sounds, such as the sound of an engine or heart beat, has been an easier task. But it's difficult to program the computer for such fuzzy sounds as the crushing of glass or wood.    Mr. Savic says the software the group has developed has other noise-detecting applications, such as recognizing the opening of a safe, detecting types of heart disease and diagnosing the cause of a malfunctioning engine. </TEXT></DOC>
