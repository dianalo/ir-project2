By seeking overall defense outlays of $295.2 billion forfiscal 1992, Mr. Bush's spending package marks the first timesince the mid-1970s that the White House has proposed anactual year-to-year reduction in military expenditures.Focusing on the long-term strategy of shrinking the militaryin light of improved U.S.-Soviet relations, theadministration's goal is to create a substantially smaller,more mobile force able to react quickly to Third Worldflare-ups such as the Gulf crisis.</LP><TEXT>   The Pentagon's payroll would shrink by nearly 500,000people over the next five years, including civilians and tensof thousands of reservists Congress has been loath to cutfrom the budget.   In the process, President Bush and Defense Secretary DickCheney want to eliminate production of the M-1 tank, theBradley armored vehicle and the F-16 Falcon, phase out fundsto modify F-14 carrier-based fighters, and even scale backspending on the Army's Patriot air-defense system, which hasproved so successful against Iraq's Scud missiles.   The Pentagon says these cutbacks are necessary because ofthe widespread force reductions under way, and it wants toterminate 27 other weapons over the next few years. Lawmakersare expected to strongly oppose many of the cuts for policyreasons, as well as to avoid losing defense jobs in theirhome states.   Meanwhile, the biggest spending increases are reserved forthe B-2 stealth bomber and the Strategic Defense Initiative,which are two of the most controversial programs on CapitolHill and which got off the ground well before the end of theCold War. Congress is expected to balk at spending more than$9.4 billion, or nearly one-sixth of the Pentagon's entireprocurement budget, on these two big-ticket items in fiscal1992, which begins Oct. 1.   Seeking to maintain defense spending authority just under$291 billion for both fiscal 1992 and 1993, the budget pavesthe way for scaling down Pentagon expenditures to 1980levels. Budget authority represents the total amountcommitted for certain programs, but it can be spent over aspan of several years.   Mr. Cheney told reporters that the Pentagon's revisedstrategy concentrates more on regional conflicts than on &quot;theneed to be prepared to go into global conflict with theSoviets on short notice.&quot; If Congress approves the planthrough 1997, he said, &quot;we will be at the lowest level ofspending as a percentage of the federal budget in 50 years.&quot;   But Mr. Cheney, reflecting the Bush administration'sconcern about Moscow's crackdown on nationalist groupsseeking independence from the Soviet Union, quickly addedthat &quot;the jury is still out on where the Soviet military isheaded.&quot; The defense chief said that recent Sovietdevelopments &quot;give me some pause for concern&quot; and that thePentagon could &quot;recommend stopping before we get down to the{spending} levels embodied&quot; in the latest plan.   Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis.), chairman of the House ArmedServices Committee, said that the budget boosts developmentof many &quot;Cold War items,&quot; while &quot;basic research that couldgive us the right defense for the future is cut back.&quot;   Over the next six years, the plan envisions cutting theArmy by 25% and trimming the Navy's fleet of combat ships bynearly that much, including mothballing two of thebattleships now operating in the Gulf. Both the F-16 and F-15production lines would grind slowly to a halt, and more than400 aging Air Force fighters and bombers would be retired.Nearly all military construction is proposed to be frozen infiscal 1993. And funding for new tanks, sealift ships andstealth aircraft would come at the expense of many of thetime-tested weapons currently being used in the Middle East.   Sen. William Cohen (R., Maine), an influential voice onthe Senate Armed Services Committee, said he doesn't foreseesending back to Europe the troops the U.S. pulled out ofthere to defend Saudi Arabia. &quot;You're going to see aconfiguration of the military that is more {of a} rapiddeployment force,&quot; he told a group of Washington editors, onethat relies heavily on naval power and long-range aircapability.   The overall numbers were part of the budget agreementworked out between Congress and the White House last fall,but those don't reflect the cost of deploying and maintaininghalf a million U.S. troops in the Middle East. Nor do theyinclude the cost of fighting a war against Saddam Hussein andthen replacing the tanks, aircraft and other equipment thatis damaged or destroyed. Cost estimates for even a shortconflict exceed $60 billion, and White House Budget DirectorRichard Darman has said it's likely to cost $5 billion justto bring all the troops and equipment back home.   Given this uncertainty, the White House intends to submitto Congress supplemental budget requests starting at the endof the month to deal with the issue. Mr. Darman toldreporters yesterday that the U.S. already has &quot;commitments&quot;from allies totaling $51 billion that &quot;should be very closeto sufficient if the war is of the type that everyone isassuming.&quot;   But many of those pledges aren't legally binding, andthere is a widespread feeling in Congress that some countrieshaven't done enough to finance the war. Moreover, Sen. Cohenand other skeptical lawmakers worry that Pentagon officialswill try to shift many routine expenditures to war-relatedaccounts.   The proposal is likely to raise the hackles of lawmakersfor other reasons, too. About one-quarter of the anticipatedsavings in fiscal 1992, for example, are slated to come frommanagement initiatives such as trimming overhead,centralizing maintenance and computer operations, andcurtailing spare-parts inventories.   A further $1 billion in savings is anticipated fromclosing military bases world-wide over the next three years,though Mr. Cheney hasn't yet submitted a formal list ofpotential sites. Such savings typically are hard tosubstantiate, prompting many deficit-conscious lawmakers todemand deeper cuts in uniformed personnel or procurementaccounts instead.   Other critics are bound to ask why the Air Force is due toget nearly a $4 billion increase in budget authority,primarily for stepped-up purchases of Northrop Corp.'s B-2bomber and the troubled C-17 cargo plane built by a unit ofMcDonnell Douglas Corp.   And the Pentagon's research and development budget, alsostrongly influenced by the Air Force's programs, includingdevelopment of a new-generation fighter, is proposed to climbto $39.9 billion, or nearly 15% higher than current levels.   The Army, by comparison, would have half of its top 14acquisition programs terminated next year and its budgetslashed nearly 15% by the fall of 1994. Senior Armyofficials, in fact, already are complaining to Congress thatOperation Desert Storm makes it impossible to reduce troopstrength as quickly as the Pentagon proposed only a fewmonths ago. &quot;We will not charge down a path of reduction forreduction's sake,&quot; one senior Army officer said.   No matter how long the Gulf war lasts, the Army and AirForce are bound to request heftier funding for tank-killingmissiles and other precision munitions.   The overall defense spending figure includes EnergyDepartment funds for making nuclear warheads and for cleaningup facilities where such operations took place. Here are thehighlights of the military budget proposed by Mr. Bush:                                                                                                          STRATEGIC DEFENSE INITIATIVE: The anti-missile programwould remain by far the military's largest research project,earmarked to receive about $4.6 billion, or nearly 50% morethan in the current fiscal year. The Pentagon hopes to revivesupport for SDI by focusing research on limited protectionagainst a few ballistic missiles, such as the Iraqi Scudsthat have been launched against Israel and Saudi Arabia, andemphasizing land-based rather than space-based technologies.   The budget also seeks $603 million to develop bettertactical anti-missile systems, including work on the Patriotmanufactured by Raytheon Corp. The Army, however, isn'tasking for funds to purchase Raytheon missiles in 1992 beyondthose included in previous multiyear contracts.                                                                                                          B-2 STEALTH BOMBER: In a program that's bound to be themost inviting target once again for military budget-cutterson Capitol Hill, the administration wants $4.8 billion tocontinue testing and to buy four more of the radar-eludingplanes. The Pentagon hopes to increase the assembly rate andbuy seven bombers in fiscal 1993. But senior House Democrats,who blocked the Air Force from ordering any B-2s this year,have vowed to keep the fleet from expanding beyond 15 planes.                                                                                                          MX MISSILES: The administration essentially has abandonedplans to deploy these multiple-warhead missiles on speciallybuilt railroad cars, though it is seeking $458 million in1992 to continue research and to purchase the last batch ofmissiles. Currently based in silos, the missiles are made bya team of contractors that includes Boeing Co. and MartinMarietta Corp. The budget also puts on the back burner thedevelopment of the mobile Midgetman missile, an alternativeto the mobile MX.                                                                                                          AIR FORCE FIGHTERS: The Pentagon wants to end productionof General Dynamics Corp.'s F-16 fighter at the end of fiscal1993, but it is requesting $3.9 billion by then to push aheadwith development of the next generation of radar-eludingfighters.                                                                                                          NAVY FIGHTERS: In a decision bound to infuriate somelawmakers, the budget seeks to save $1.4 billion in fiscal1992 and $12 billion more through the late 1990s by cancelingplans to upgrade the fleet of Grumman Corp.'s F-14 fighters.Critics contend that the proposal, coupled with the earliercancellation of the Navy's A-12 attack plane, threatens tostrip carrier decks of planes. The Pentagon contends,however, that it wouldn't be a problem, because the number ofcarriers is shrinking to 12 from 13 and perhaps would golower by the end of fiscal 1995.                                                                                                          LH HELICOPTER: Despite congressional criticism and a majorreshuffling of the program, the Army is asking for nearly$550 million to begin full-scale development of thishigh-technology scout helicopter. It's one of the Army's fewbig-ticket items to emerge from the budget process relativelyunscathed.                                                                                                          SUBMARINES: The budget terminates purchases after the 18thnuclear-powered, missile-carrying Trident submarine isdelivered by a General Dynamics unit, but it seeks $1.2billion for purchasing 28 more missiles. The Navy also isasking for a total of nearly $6.8 billion to purchase anotherhigh-speed Seawolf attack submarine and five ArleighBurke-class guided missile destroyers.                                                                                                          C-17 CARGO PLANE: Reflecting the heightened interest inairlift as a result of the Gulf war, the budget earmarks $2.8billion in fiscal 1992 and $4.2 billion the following yearfor stepped-up production of the Air Force's next-generationcargo aircraft.</TEXT></DOC>
