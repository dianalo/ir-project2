The Congress and the President subsequentlyendorsed this approach through legislation, the Base Closure RealignmentAct, Title II, Public Law 100-526. The Commission's report presented tothe Secretary of Defense on December 29, 1988, effects approximately 111Army installations. Pub. L. 100-526 exempted the actions of the Commissionfrom the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA)in their decision making process for recommending bases to be closed orrealigned. The Army, however, will prepare environmental impact analysesrequired by NEPA for the implementation of proposed actions involving Armyinstallations. Implementation of these actions will occur only after reviewand approval by the U.S. Congress.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>Scoping: </T2>The Army will conduct scoping meetings to aid in determiningthe significant issues for each of the actions requiring an environmentalimpact statement and in special cases for actions requiring an environmentalassessment. The public, as well as federal, state, and local agencies areencouraged to participate in the scoping process by submitting data, information,and comments identifying relevant environmental and socioeconomic issuesand potential future uses of the excessed real estate that would assistthe Army in analyzing potentially significant impacts. Useful informationincludes other environmental studies, published and unpublished data, andpossible mitigation measures associated with the proposed action.Individuals and agencies may offer information or data relevant to theenvironmental or socioeconomic impacts by attending public scoping meetingsthat will be announced in the local media of the affected installationor by writing James B. Hildreth; Assistant Chief, Planning Division; U.S.Army Corps of Engineers District, Mobile; P.O Box 2288; Mobile, Alabama36628-0001. The scoping meetings are planned to begin within the next twomonths. Comments, suggestions, and requests to be placed on the mailinglist for announcements should be sent to Mr. Hildreth at the above address.Addressing the cumulative impacts as required by the Presidents Councilon Environmental Quality regulations will be accomplished by grouping themutually affected losing and/or gaining installations into a package forthe purpose of preparing the analyses and documentation required by NEPA.The Army intends to prepare an EIS for each of the following packages ofproposed actions;<ITAG tagnum="84">A.
