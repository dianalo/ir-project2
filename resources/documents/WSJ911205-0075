Government reports didn't offer stock market investors anysolace, either. The Commerce Department revised the economy'sgrowth rate for the third quarter, as measured by grossdomestic product, to 1.7% from the 2.3% reported earlier.Economists said the figure tends to indicate that the economyis headed for a second brush with recession.   The Federal Reserve's &quot;beige book,&quot; a periodic compilationof economic data from around the country meant as a guide formonetary policymakers, also tended to the pessimistic side.It cited &quot;flagging momentum&quot; in the economy. But the reportalso noted that inflation pressures are steady ordiminishing.   The improving inflation outlook spurred bond pricesmodestly higher. Bonds got a second boost later in the dayafter President Bush said in a speech that he would propose a&quot;common sense&quot; plan for the economy in January. Bond traderstook some comfort in the president's restrained approach tothe nation's economic problems. Prices of long-term Treasurybonds had been kept down by fears that the administration andCongress would panic in an election year and overstimulatethe economy, touching off inflationary pressures.   The focus in financial markets now is on tomorrow'sNovember employment report. If it confirms that economicgrowth was nearly nonexistent last month, some analystsbelieve the Federal Reserve will move immediately to pushshort-term interest rates lower.
