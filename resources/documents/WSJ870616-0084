Alley chairman and chief executive officer and Thomas C. Hays president and chief operating officer of the tobacco, consumer products and financial services company.    The 57-year-old Mr. Alley, most recently vice chairman and chief operating officer, succeeds Edward W. Whittemore, 64, who is retiring after six years in the top posts at Old Greenwich, Conn.-based American Brands.    Mr. Alley's appointment is effective immediately. Mr. Hays, 52, assumes his new posts Jan. 1, when he succeeds Virginius B. Lougee III,, 61, who is retiring.    While industry analysts don't foresee much change in the company's direction, Mr. Alley has a background in the insurance industry, and might move American Brands more into financial services through acquisitions, suggested Diana Temple, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.    Mr. Alley declined to be interviewed.    Mr. Alley was chairman and chief executive of Springfield, Ill.-based Franklin Life Insurance Co. when it was acquired by American Brands in 1979. In 1985, he became senior vice president and chief financial officer of American Brands.    &quot;If there'll be any difference&quot; under the new leadership, Ms. Temple said, &quot;it'll be in the acquisition strategy.&quot;    American Brands, which has had an aggressive acquisition strategy, mostly in brand-name consumer products, earned $365 million, or $3.18 a share, on sales of $8.47 billion in 1986.    The company's main brands include Carlton, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Tareyton cigarettes; Sunshine crackers and cookies; and Titleist, Pinnacle and Foot-Joy golf products. In April, the company bought James B. Beam Distilling Co. from National Distillers andamp; Chemical Corp. for $545 million.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, American Brands closed at $47.50, unchanged.    American Brands is &quot;a smoothly running company,&quot; said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with Montgomery Securities Inc. The person who takes over will basically just have to keep it running, he added.    &quot;What American Brands has been able to do is find the magic formula of how much should be centralized and how much should be decentralized,&quot; said Mr. Goldman. He explained that the company has &quot;centralized advice,&quot; but kept the operations of the subsidiaries largely independent.    Ms. Temple described Mr. Alley's management style as fitting with that of American Brands' -- &quot;solid and conservative.&quot;    David Seifer, who follows the insurance industry for First Boston Corp., said Mr. Alley was a &quot;warm, dedicated&quot; person who came up in Franklin Life through the marketing side. &quot;He was a great salesman, but also a great manager of people and of business,&quot; he said.    Mr. Hays, the new president, will succeed Mr. Lougee, who also had been chief operating officer. Mr. Alley had been given Mr. Lougee's title of chief operating officer last month, but he will relinquish that title in favor of Mr. Hays.    Mr. Hays remains president and chief executive of the company's largest subsidiary, Stamford, Conn.-based American Tobacco Co. He previously was president and chief executive of Andrew Jergens Co., a consumer products unit of American Brands.    Salomon's Ms. Temple said that under Mr. Hays, who also has a marketing background, the tobacco unit has pursued an aggressive marketing strategy, launching a new cigarette brand, Malibu, that has done well in test markets. </TEXT></DOC>
