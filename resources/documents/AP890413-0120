According to a report issued by Judge President Wilson Sandurafollowing a two-month inquiry of six Cabinet ministers, onlyForeign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira was cleared of wrongdoing.   Sandura's three-man commission recommends the five be prosecutedfor black marketeering. It identifies them as: Defense MinisterEnos Nkala; Political Affairs Minister Frederick Shava; HigherEducation Minister Dzingai Mutumbuka; Industry and TechnologyMinister Callistus Ndlovu; and Maurice Nyagumbo, the most seniorminister accused and a staunch Mugabe ally.   Nyagumbo resigned just hours before the 121-page report waspublished. Nkala and Shava quit the government and sole legalpolitical party last month, after it was discovered they had liedto the commission.   The report also suggests Mutumbuka and Matabeleland North Gov.Jacob Mudenda be prosecuted for perjury.   Its publication of abuses of power and privileges in theleadership has rocked this avowedly socialist government, but alsowon Mugabe praise for ordering some of his closest aides to facethe embarrassment of being quizzed under the public spotlight.   Mugabe is expected to announce major changes to his Cabinetwithin the next few days, his aides said on condition of anonymity.   Sandura investigated charges that Cabinet ministers and theirfriends bought cars and trucks at Willowvale assembly plant at low,fixed prices without having to wait. They then resold them on theblack market for up to five times what they paid.   Ordinary Zimbabweans frequently wait up to 10 years to buy a carbecause of a lack of hard currency.   Mugabe on Thursday ordered Sandura to inquire into vehicle salesto officials at Zimbabwe's two other assembly plants.   Lines of people gathered early Thursday outside the governmentprinting offices seeking copies of Sandura's report, but they werenot available immediately.   During the proceedings, spectators had crowded into the HighCourt to jeer and boo many of the 60 witnesses, reflecting mountingdiscontent with the people who have led the avowedly socialistgovernment for the nine years since independence from Britain.</TEXT></DOC>
