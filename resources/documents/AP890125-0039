ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Attorney Ronald Brown has emerged as thefront-runner in the race for Democratic Party chairman, despitecomplaints from party conservatives about his association with JesseJackson in the 1988 presidential campaign.   Brown picked up endorsements from West Virginia Democrats onTuesday, the latest in a series of announcements that cemented hisposition as the man to beat in the race to succeed Paul G. Kirk Jr.as chairman of the party.   At the same time, an Alabama party leader said election of Brownas chairman would be a victory for the ``Kennedy, Cuomo, Dukakisultra-liberal element.''   John Baker, Alabama Democratic Party chairman, said Brown wastrying ``play on the liberal conscience'' by making an issue of thefact that he is black and had ties to Jackson.   ``He stands up and he says `I'm the most qualified candidate' _which is a ridiculously presumptuous statement _ and if I wasn'tblack I'd win and if I wasn't connected to Jesse Jackson I'd win,''said Baker.   ``That's tremendously presumptive and that's a slap at the othercandidates. It's Ron Brown who's creating that, trying to play onthe liberal conscience.''   Among those who have endorsed Brown, who was Jackson's conventionmanager last year, are Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and New York Gov.Mario Cuomo. Party sources said Michael Dukakis would add hisbacking to Brown by week's end and that Democratic NationalCommittee members from Massachusetts would join their governor inthat endorsement.   Also competing for the party leadership are Michigan DemocraticParty chairman Richard Wiener and former Reps. Jim Jones of Oklahomaand James Stanton of Ohio.   Wiener and Jones met over the weekend and sources, speaking oncondition of anonymity, said they discussed the possibility ofcombining forces. However, the sources said they were unable toreach agreement on which should drop out and support the other.   Democratic National Committee members will vote Feb. 10 to fillthe chairmanship for a four-year term, but many committee memberssay they hope the race will be settled before the vote.   ``A lot of us want it to be over before we get to Washington,''said Suellen Albrecht, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party.   When Brown first began seeking support for the chairmanship, hisrole in the Jackson campaign was cited by Jews prominent in partyaffairs as a reason for opposing him.   However, a group of Jewish activists including Rep. Sander Levinof Michigan, Steve Grossman of Massachusetts, a leading fund-raiserfor Dukakis; Ed Sanders and Steve Moses of Los Angeles; and WalterShorenstein of San Francisco endorsed Brown and worked to convinceJewish Democrats that it was unfair to link Brown to Jackson.   ``A number of us have talked to opinion-makers within the Jewishcommunity,'' said Levin.   In an article written for Washington Jewish Weekly, Levin wrotethat ``Ron Brown did not subscribe to every position held by JesseJackson. He has made clear that he would respond to Jesse Jackson asto other Democratic leaders, with no hesitation to accept his viewswhen he is right nor to reject them when he is wrong.''   Grossman raised money for Brown and also boosted his candidacyamong other Jews.   ``I don't see Ron as being somehow a radical guy who just becausehe was convention manager for Jesse somehow bought into all ofJesse's rhetoric,'' he said.   ``I recognize that for some the perception can be all wrong,''said Grossman. ``They'll say Ron Brown can be the greatest guy inthe world, he can be a fine, wonderful guy with lots of judgment,lots of vision, but it's just going to play badly in a lot ofplaces.''   A Washington attorney who once was staff director of the SenateJudiciary Committee when Kennedy was chairman, Brown agreed lastspring to serve as convention manager for Jackson. In that role, hewas widely credited with helping bring about the show of unity onthe closing night of the convention.   Baker said that if Brown is elected chairman he would think itwas ``wasting the Alabama Democratic Party's money'' to continueattending national party functions.   ``You can't secede from the national party, though, frankly, Iwould,'' he said.   ``I'm not sure that's what we need right now,'' said JamesRuvolo, the Ohio Democratic Party chairman, who backs Wiener for thenational post.   ``Mr. Baker's remarks not only surprise me, but they make me verysad,'' said Pat Eddington, a Democratic National Committee memberfrom Alabama.</TEXT></DOC>
