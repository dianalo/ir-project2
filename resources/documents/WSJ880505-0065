Nasdaq's composite index lost 0.61 to 381.62, with all the decline coming in the last hour of trading. However, the index is still 8.42 above the level of April 21, before the eight consecutive days of gains.    &quot;Retail volume was off today. The small John Q. Public isn't around, and that's the guy we need,&quot; said Roger &quot;Buddy&quot; West, president of Brokers Securities Inc., a Norfolk, Va., discount broker that specializes in OTC issues. Mr. West attributed the lack of interest to the general slowdown in volume on the New York Stock Exchange the past two weeks -- a trend that he and other market watchers said took time to catch up to the OTC market.    Smaller OTC stocks were weaker than bigger ones yesterday, another reflection of a lack of interest from retail customers. One way of measuring that: 20% of the 4,658 Nasdaq issues advanced yesterday; but of the Nasdaq issues that don't trade on the National Market System -- a category that includes the generally smaller and less heavily traded OTC issues -- only 8% advanced.    Mr. West provided a more informal indicator of the retail problem, which might be called the FNN Factor. Mr. West's firm runs 60-second commercials every other day on cable television's Financial News Network. He says responses usually come in instantly -- but yesterday brokers sat by their phones in peace.    &quot;I think the commercial drew less response today than it has on any day in weeks,&quot; bemoaned Mr. West.    The Nasdaq 100 index of the largest OTC industrial stocks fell 0.63 to 357.36, a 0.18% decline. That compares with a 1.07% drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday.    Cadbury Schweppes lost 4 3/8 to 61 1/8 on profit-taking after a recent price surge on takeover talk. Some traders said they soured on the stock because of news yesterday that British regulators would study the anti-competitive ramifications of Kuwait's stake in British Petroleum Co.; the thinking is that foreign moves on U.K.-based Cadbury might be blocked by the authorities.    On the plus side, Centerre Bancorp. jumped 3 1/4 to 40 before Nasdaq halted quotes late in the day. The St. Louis-based bank holding company subsequently announced it received a proposal from Boatmen's Bancshares for a &quot;friendly merger&quot; at $50 a share in Boatmen's stock. Centerre already has agreed to merge with Mercantile Bancorp., a proposed merger that Centerre said still may be completed. It's studying the Boatmen's bid. Meanwhile, Boatmen's fell 1 1/4 to 32 3/4 and Mercantile rose 3/4 to 22 3/4.    McCormick andamp; Co. rose 1 1/2 to 27 1/4. Analysts told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that the company's planned sale of its McCormick Properties unit is likely to produce after-tax profit of as much as $240 million.    Gartner Group rose 1 3/4 to 12 3/4. Fiscal fourth-quarter profit totaled 29 cents a share, compared with 17 cents a share a year earlier.    Apple Computer, Nasdaq's largest stock, rose 1/4 to 42 on volume of two million shares, third-highest among OTC stocks yesterday. Officials of the big computer maker, meeting with analysts yesterday in Cupertino, Calif., announced expected revenue growth this year of 40% to 45%, above Apple's previous estimate of 30% to 40%.    Total Nasdaq volume yesterday was 134,207,800. More issues fell than rose; but because of gains in huge OTC stocks, such as Apple, 45.5 million shares rose and 40.3 million fell. </TEXT></DOC>
