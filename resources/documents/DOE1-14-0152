Invivo studies with these drugs have also been conducted in a C/sub 3/Hmouse MCa tumor system to determine if the same reoxygenation effectobserved in spheroids could be demonstrated in the solid tumor system.Detailed microelectrode studies, employing each drug at its LD/sub 10/level, have been unable to demonstrate any drug induced reoxygenationfor any of the drugs tested. Complete details are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
