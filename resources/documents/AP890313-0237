But although fare cutting could produce rates as cheap as $49one-way tickets between New York and Florida, analysts say,discounts are unlikely to be widespread.   ``I don't think you're going to see a lot of matching'' bycompetitors, said Edward Starkman, an airline analyst forPaineWebber Inc.   Like the $12 shuttle fare, further cut-rate ticket promotionswould be an attempt to preserve market share during the cripplingstrike by Eastern's Machinists union and walkouts by its pilots andflight attendants.   Eastern filed for federal bankruptcy court protection fromcreditors last Thursday, citing a cash crisis stemming from thestrike that began March 4.   Analysts say Eastern's likeliest fare move would be to offercheap flights to its primary market of Florida as travelers beginflocking south for Easter and Spring Break. Industry speculationpoints to a $49 one-way ticket between New York and Florida, whichwould be about half the prevailing discount fare.   But experts cautioned that any fare-cutting probably would beshort-lived and unlikely to be matched by Miami-based Eastern'scompetitors. Furthermore, some travel agents may refuse to sell thecheap tickets.   Eastern's rivals in the lucrative Florida market, notably DeltaAir Lines, already are booked to near capacity on those flights,Starkman and others said.   ``We'll have to take a look at each individual (fare) action,''said Jackie Pate, a spokeswoman for Delta at its Atlantaheadquarters.   United Airlines spokesman Charlie Lopez in Chicago said thatcarrier would reserve judgment until Eastern actually introduced anynew fares.   Eastern wouldn't say whether it was considering launching thefares and officials declined to comment on how the airline wouldprovide enough planes to meet demand if such a promotion was staged.   Hundreds of passengers were stranded in New York, Washington andBoston airports Sunday night when Eastern could not get enoughplanes in the air to accommodate the throngs that bought $12 shuttletickets.   ``We will approach each market on an individual basis; we havenot indicated what our fare plans are,'' said company spokesmanRobin Matell in Miami.   If Eastern does slash its Florida fares, some travel agents saythey won't offer the tickets, fearing the risk to passengers offlying on a strike-bound carrier and a possible deluge of refundrequests if flights are cancelled.   ``I can't afford to have clients come back to me withcomplaints,'' said David Perelman, president of DMS Travel inManhattan. ``It's a great deal _ if you can get on a plane.''   Suzanne Jensen, a spokeswoman for Uniglobe Travel (International)Inc. in Vancouver, British Columbia, said some of the company'sfranchised travel agents would sell the cut-rate tickets only ifcustomers insisted _ but would not provide refunds.   Sharply discounted fares have been used in the past by airlinesthat have been hit with strikes and wanted to reclaim market share,analysts said.   Frank Lorenzo, who controls Eastern and Continental Airlinesthrough Texas Air Corp., put Continental into bankruptcy inSeptember 1983, fired striking employees and offered cheap fares toany destination a few days later.   Continental remained operating as a low-price carrier, althoughthe rock-bottom fares were offered only for a few weeks.   Analysts say they don't expect Eastern to stick with a discountstrategy for long because the company can't afford it.   ``Eastern has been unprofitable (even) with normal fares,'' saidLouis Marckesano, an airline analyst with Janney Montgomery ScottInc. in Philadelphia.   A $49 one-way fare between New York and Florida would be roughlythe level where Eastern could break even, assuming that planes werefull, Marckesano suggested.</TEXT></DOC>
