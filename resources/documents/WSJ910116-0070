Of course, oil became plentiful and cheaper in the1980s, as the Carter plan's controls and taxes weredismantled.</LP><TEXT>   We bring this up now because the turmoil in the PersianGulf has many in Washington yearning to make the samemistakes. Tax credits, regulations, subsidies, the moralequivalent of &quot;synfuels&quot; -- here we go again. Admiral JamesWatkins, Mr. Bush's Energy Secretary, seems to be one ofthose who has forgotten the 1970s.   Or at least that's how it looks from reading a draft ofoptions prepared by Mr. Watkins for President Bush's&quot;National Energy Strategy.&quot; We trust the worst will bescrapped, but we'll try to shoot the wounded just to makesure.   One Carter-era favorite on the list is another cup ofCAFE, or ever-higher automobile-mileage standards. This is afavorite of environmentalists who think driving a car is animmoral act. The option paper suggests a level as high as 36miles per gallon, up from today's 27.5. Admiral Watkinsthinks this is necessary to appease Congress and hassupported a &quot;study&quot; to show how Detroit's car makers canafford this mandate. So the price will likely be more deadAmericans riding in smaller, vulnerable, more expensive cars.   Another proposal would require that &quot;alternative fuels&quot; beused in all car fleets. &quot;Without government intervention,&quot;admits the draft, &quot;it is unlikely that alternative fueledvehicles would be introduced in sufficient numbers to haveany impact on U.S. energy security for at least two decades.&quot;So Americans must be ordered to buy them. Even Energy admitsthis brainstorm would cost some $5 billion in higher carprices and require big subsidies for the &quot;alternatives&quot; thataren't mass-produced yet.   The draft also proposes new subsidies and tax goodies.&quot;Renewable energy production&quot; would get a generous taxwrite-off, as would &quot;high payoff energy technology&quot; research.Just how Washington will decide what is &quot;high payoff&quot; isn'texplained, but you can bet Congress will have no troublefinding beneficiaries. &quot;Advanced transportation fuels frombiomass&quot; would be favored, whatever that is, as would thenirvana of the electric car. And so on.   There are at least a few good things in the draft.Removing regulatory bottlenecks in electricity andnatural-gas distribution is useful, as is allowing oilexploration among the scattered caribou in Alaska. Endingfederal electricity subsidies also makes sense and nuclearpower may get a long overdue promotion.   Some Bush officials think these sensible ideas have to becombined with regulatory lunacy to sell to Congress. But nomatter what Mr. Bush proposes, Congress will consider itmerely an opening bid. The Members will do another Clean AirAct and pile on. The smarter political play is for theadministration plan to stick to sound market principles fromthe start and fight the re-regulatory ideas as destructive.   As it happens, consumers have been getting a good test ofmarket principles since the Iraq crisis began in August. Oilprices soared at first, but have settled back down as newsupplies came on stream. Including the newfive-cents-a-gallon tax, the price of a gallon of gas in mostof the country isn't too much more than it was before thecrisis.   That hasn't stopped the ignorant from asserting thattroops in the Gulf represent U.S. &quot;energy policy.&quot; But evento the extent that protecting oil supplies is a U.S. goal inthe Gulf, the point is to protect oil's flow at market prices(which are also the cheapest prices). If we're worried thatSaddam Hussein could impose an &quot;oil tax,&quot; why should weimpose a huge tax on ourselves first? As everyone but theDepartment of Energy and Congress learned in the 1970s, thefree market remains the best energy &quot;security&quot; we have.</TEXT></DOC>
