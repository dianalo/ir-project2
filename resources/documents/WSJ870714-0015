CarrollStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/14/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> IBMCOMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   International Business Machines Corp., despite a previous failure with its PCjr, is expected to unveil a personal computer aimed primarily at the education market within the next few weeks, industry executives say.    Some say the machine -- which is expected to be priced as low as $1,000 to $1,200, including the monitor -- also will be marketed for use in the home and in small businesses.    In any case, the machine would be a gamble for IBM because it would be aimed at markets where IBM traditionally hasn't done well. But if successful, the machine could primarily pose a challenge to Apple Computer Inc. and Tandy Corp., and also will hurt smaller makers of IBM-compatible machines.    Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM, as usual, declined to comment on product plans. But a dealer, a large customer and several IBM insiders confirm that an announcement is nigh.    IBM had seemed to abandon the low end of the personal computer market when it introduced its new Personal System/2 line in early April. The company, which has said it will avoid parts of the computer market that become commodity businesses, halted production of the PC and the PC XT, and priced the low end of the new line at a substantial $1,695, without a monitor.    But &quot;they still were making money on the XT, and IBM does not leave money on the table,&quot; said Bob Orbach, director of business development at 47th Street Computer, a New York retailer.    IBM is expected to bring out a machine that uses the same central processor as the XT, has the same color monitor as the machine that is at the low end of the company's new PC line, according to the industry executives.    Historically, IBM remains flexible until the last possible moment on the pricing and configuration of a new product, so the industry sources caution that their information is somewhat speculative.    Though IBM's new line of personal computers has done moderately well, it is by no means certain that a new low-end machine would succeed. Low-end sales depend largely on price, and IBM doesn't like to compete on price. The company's PCjr flopped in 1985 because IBM misjudged the market. Among other things, the machine was criticized for having limited memory, an awkward keyboard and for its high price, although IBM attempted to correct these problems.    In addition, the education, home and small-business markets hold less potential than IBM's traditional big-business market because they are so much smaller. For instance, research firms said IBM will sell about 2.5 million personal computers to big business this year, while the entire education market will be about 500,000 units, and those units will be much less expensive than the ones businesses buy. The firms said IBM accounts for less than 10% of the education market, while Apple has about 60% and Tandy has more than 20%.    Charles Wolf, an analyst at First Boston Inc., New York, said a new IBM machine would hurt Tandy more than Apple in the secondary-school market. &quot;The education market is software-driven, and Apple has the great software,&quot; he said. &quot;In addition, Apple has great relations with school systems.&quot;    Tandy said it thinks it would continue to hold a price advantage over IBM. &quot;You're competing with equipment that's available . . . in Tandy's line from $599 up, and we discount,&quot; said Ed Juge, director of market planning at Tandy.    Separately, dealers said IBM has begun offering additional discounts on its new line of personal computers and has begun paying freight charges. The discounts, which become available if dealers exceed their sales projections, total as much as 2%. &quot;That's big bucks,&quot; said Robert J. Crowell, chief executive officer of Neeco Inc., a Canton, Mass.-based dealer.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, IBM's stock rose $2.875 to close yesterday at $169.875 a share. The increase reflects growing belief that IBM's earnings to be reported today will be better than initially expected. </TEXT></DOC>
