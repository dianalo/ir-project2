Whittaker, theCarnegie-Mellon University professor considered one of the nation's foremostrobot designers.;    First came the demonstration for government officials ofthe Ambler, Whittaker's 19-foot-tall, six-legged robot designed to exploreMars someday.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ROBOTS GET DOWN TO WORKAUTOMATONS MOVE FROM LABS TO JOBS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO><TEXT>     In a rock garden on the Carnegie-Mellon campus, Ambler stepped over highboulders and avoided holes, a formidable achievement for a robot. &quot;It was oneof those holy moments,&quot; said Whittaker, 42, a former Marine whose friends callhim Red. &quot;It was mystical to see the Ambler get up and go. My heart was in mythroat.&quot;;    Then one afternoon a few weeks later, in a less formaldemonstration, Whittaker and his colleagues took a van crammed withelectronics out onto Pittsburgh's streets.;    While a human driver controlledthe vehicle, a computer and a laser vision system in the back &quot;watched&quot; thevan follow the white lines up and down streets.;    Then the driver let go ofthe steering wheel and the computer took over, flawlessly steering the vandown the street, staying in its own lane.;    This, too, was a significantaccomplishment for a robot because tasks seemingly as simple as guiding avehicle down a straight line have long confounded machines built to mimic themost elementary actions of humans.;    &quot;At that point, there was nothing to dobut break out the beer and celebrate,&quot; Whittaker said.;    For the last twodecades, robots have seemed on the verge of emerging as powerful machines toreduce drudgery and usher in a new age of human-machine interaction.;    Theyhave had success in factories, performing repetitive tasks at fixed workstations, and highly automated factories are the result. Still, as automatedhelpmates, they have been disappointing.;    But now some experts believerobotics could be on the verge of a long-awaited era in which robots becomemobile, flexible and intelligent.;    They are made possible by the increasingpower of computers, their falling costs, advances in software and the steadyevolution of vision and other electronic sensing systems.;    To make theircase, experts point to the menagerie of robotic creatures that have emerged inrecent years from places like Carnegie-Mellon's Field Robotics Laboratory,which Whittaker heads, and similar facilities at the Massachusetts Instituteof Technology and the California Institute of Technology's Jet PropulsionLaboratory.;    What sets the new machines apart is that they are mobile,using either wheels or multiple feet. They navigate accurately and userudimentary intelligence to solve problems they encounter.;    &quot;The game haschanged radically,&quot; Whittaker said. &quot;The service that a robot can delivertoday is vastly superior to what one could do 10 years ago.&quot;;    InWhittaker's vision, robots like Ambler and autonomous vehicles like the vanwill lead to an age in which humans work as partners with mobile robots.;   The new generation of machines will thrive in places that humans can't go andperform physical feats too dangerous, too boring or otherwise impossible fortheir human masters.;    For example, robots were used with great success in acleanup operation late last year after a flood at a nuclear power plant inOswego, N.Y., scattered barrels of nuclear waste around a large room.;   &quot;This is not the factory of the future,&quot; Whittaker said. &quot;The ideas that makeit in the factory don't make it in the outside world.&quot; He envisions machinesdoing things as mundane as driving trucks.;    Roboticists are incurableoptimists, and many obstacles must be surmounted before useful robots arecommon.;    The computers that guide Ambler, for example, are still too largeto be contained on the robot itself.;    But early indications areencouraging. Simple mobile robots have begun to find their way into thecommercial sector, and more are likely to appear soon.;    Some enthusiaststalk of thousands of the machines at work by the end of the decade.;    Largecorporations are eagerly following the trail pioneered by a handful ofstart-up companies. Military contractors like General Dynamics, FMC, MartinMarietta and Lockheed are all pushing mobile robotic applications.;   Caterpillar Inc. has embarked on a joint venture with the Carnegie-Mellongroup to create a robot driver for earthmovers used in open pit mines. Themachines sometimes tip over, injuring or killing drivers.;    The federalBureau of Mines is beginning tests on a robotic coal miner in a Pennsylvaniacoal mine. &quot;We are trying to use modern technology to get the man removed fromthe operation,&quot; said Thomas J. Fisher, research supervisor for the bureau.;   Redzone, a commercial venture spun off from the Carnegie-Mellon group, isbuilding robots capable of cleaning up nuclear waste sites.;    Whittaker'sgroup has a contract with NASA to design a robot to inspect the space shuttletiles. And the Pentagon is sponsoring a mobile robot version of the militaryHMMV, the utility vehicle that has replaced the Jeep.;    Although Congress,lobbied by some computer scientists, banned the use of autonomous vehicles todeliver weapons in 1987, Whittaker said that robot HMMVs would be ideal fortasks like removing mines or doing excavation work in zones under enemy fire.;   The Ambler has generated some controversy within the nation's tightly knitcommunity of roboticists about design philosophy.;    One group -- called the&quot;wheelheads&quot; -- prefers wheels instead of legs because they believe wheeledvehicles can cover great distances quickly, like an autonomous vehicle drivingdown a road.;    Another design orthodoxy favors small &quot;artificial life&quot;robots that are programmed to think like insects or other simple creatures.These people are known as the &quot;A-lifers.&quot;;    An MIT group of A-lifers isworking on exploring Mars using miniature foot-long robots. They argue forsending hundreds of these insect-like crawlers out over the Martian surface. Aprototype named Attila that has six legs, 150 sensors and 25 motors has beenbuilt.;    The Ambler group at Carnegie-Mellon chose legs because walkingmachines can carefully pick their way, making sure they have a firm positionbefore taking the next step, whether on Mars or the ocean bottom around an oilwell.;    Ambler looks like a cross between an eggbeater and a spider.;    Ithas two sets of three stacked legs. Each leg can swing to find new footholds.Each leg is essentially a post connected by an arm that can swing forward orto the outside, or, if it is blocked, between the two towers.;    Ambler'sfirst steps in public, taken in December before a NASA review committee, werea resounding success.;    The challenge was to walk through an unknown fieldof boulders and holes in the ground. Ambler performed flawlessly. But a fewweeks later, the project lost its NASA money for fiscal 1992 to manned Martianexploration alternatives.;    NASA officials who favor manned exploration haveargued that robots will never be as flexible as humans.;    While Ambler andNASA's interest in Mars robots have received the public attention, moresignificant is the quiet joint venture between Whittaker's group andCaterpillar to create a robot driver for the earthmovers in open pit mines.;   Caterpillar declines to discuss the project, but industry executives familiarwith it say it is one of the most ambitious uses of robot technology yetconceived and involves the latest navigation technologies.;    Drawing onNavLab, a Pentagon-backed mobile laboratory for terrestrial navigationresearch that receives position signals from a navigation satellite,Caterpillar has developed a functioning robot driver that can navigate over afour-mile stretch of road with an accuracy of several feet.;    The systemuses a laser scanning vision system and the satellite signals to follow apredetermined path accurately.;    Speeds of more than 30 miles an hour havebeen achieved, those familiar with the project said.; A robot for all reasons;U.S. companies involved in designing and manufacturing; mobile robots andtheir areas of specialization.; Company                 Specialization; ARD                    Environmental cleanup, military; Caterpillar            Heavy equipment; Combustion Eng.
