The cuts will reduce the company's workforce about 6 percent andwill include manufacturing and administration jobs at several plantsin Massachusetts and in Phoenix, Ariz., Honeywell Bull said.   The company said it hopes to achieve the cuts through earlyretirements and attrition in addition to layoffs. It said 900employees are eligible for early retirement at the Billerica-basedcompany.   Honeywell Bull will have a worldwide workforce of 18,100 afterthe cuts.   Analysts said the cuts reflect a decline in the mainframecomputer market, geared toward sophisticated scientific applicationsused principally in defense and aerospace industries.   ``It's a recognition of what's going on,'' said JeremyTennenbaum, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York.``When all is said and done the market for scientific computersoutside the Defense Department and big aerospace companies has yetto take off.''   ``The weakness of federal demand for large systems means it'sgoing to be tough sledding for everyone in the industry, especiallyif you're a new entrant,'' he said.   Honeywell Bull said the reductions are not linked to an ongoingownership restructuring of the company, which was formed in March1987 as a joint venture of France's Groupe Bull, Honeywell Inc. ofMinneapolis and NEC Corp. of Japan.   Groupe Bull last week acquired 22.6 percent of the company fromHoneywell, giving it a 65.1 percent ownership. Honeywell owns 19.9percent and NEC 15 percent.   Honeywell Bull President Roland Pampel said the layoffs,scheduled to be completed by mid-March, were taken to try to improvethe company's competitive position by cutting costs and improvingproductivity.   Pampel, who took over Honeywell Bull last July, said the changemarks a continuing consolidation. ``We're streamlining it, reactingto things we must do from a productivity point of view,'' he said inan interview.   Pampel denied that the change indicated a slump in the mainframemarket, and said a new line of computers introduced in November was``very well received by customers.''   Honeywell Bull, which moved to Billerica last September, hasoffices in the United States, Italy, the Great Britain, Canada,Australia, Mexico and Asia. It reported 1987 profits of $17.4million, less than 1 percent of revenues of $2.06 billion.   Honeywell allied with Groupe Bull and NEC to take advantage ofthe similar computer designs of all three companies. In the 1960s,when Japan and Europe were minor forces in the computer industry,Honeywell had licensed designs to the two companies.   The three parent companies remain independent apart fromHoneywell Bull, which is completing a restructuring expected toinclude a name change.</TEXT></DOC>
