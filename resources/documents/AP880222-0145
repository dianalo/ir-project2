Kennedy, the Supreme Court said Monday it wants to heara second round of arguments in two cases already under study.   The unusual move _ having lawyers twice argue a case before thejustices during one court term _ could mean that Kennedy'stie-breaking vote is needed to resolve the two cases.   At issue in one is whether defense contractors may be forced topay damages for on-duty accidents involving members of the military.   The court is deciding whether to reinstate a $725,000 award tothe family of a Marine helicopter co-pilot who died in a 1980 crashin the Atlantic Ocean near Virginia Beach, Va.   A jury awarded the damages to the family of David Boyle, whodrowned on April 27, 1983, in the crash of the CH-53 helicopter.But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the awardagainst the helicopter manufacturer, Sikorsky Aircraft, and itsparent company, United Technologies Corp.   The appeals court said Sikorsky, as a military contractor, wasshielded from being sued because the Navy approved of thehelicopter's allegedly negligent design. The justices heardarguments in the case Jan. 12.   The second case, which the court first heard Jan. 19 and will bereargued sometime in April, involves the convicted killer of anOklahoma policeman.   Prosecutors say Bobby Lynn Ross shot Elk City, Okla., PoliceSgt. Steve Mahan three times after the officer arrived at a motelbeing robbed by Ross on Jan. 5, 1983.   At issue is whether Ross' trial was tainted when the presidingjudge refused to disqualify ``for cause'' a potential juror whosaid he would vote to impose the death penalty _ and would not evenconsider a life sentence _ if Ross were convicted.   The potential juror was excluded when Ross' lawyer used one ofnine ``peremptory challenges.'' Ross contends his defense teamshould not have been forced to expend one such challenge for thatjuror.   Both cases are to be decided by July.   The court Monday refused to reconsider its 4-4 decision lastDecember striking down an Illinois law that could have madeabortions more difficult to obtain for some teen-agers.   The justices rejected a request by Illinois Attorney GeneralNeil F. Hartigan that they restudy the law ``after the appointmentof a ninth justice.''   Kennedy joined the court last Thursday, filling an eight-monthvacancy, but he did not participate in Monday's order denyingreconsideration in the Illinois case.   He did join in the orders requiring reargument in the two othercases.   In seeking reconsideration, Hartigan emphasized the importanceof ``a decision by a full court'' in the case.   The Illinois law required girls under 18 and still financiallydependent on their parents notify both parents 24 hours beforehaving an abortion.   The law allowed a girl to avoid notifying her parents if shecould prove to a state judge that she was mature enough andwell-informed enough to make the decision on her own and thatnotifying her parents would not be in her best interest.   Doctors who failed to comply with the law's requirement facedcriminal prosecution.</TEXT></DOC>
