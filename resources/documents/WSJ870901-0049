The department, which proposed the rule in June, wants to put out a final regulation before Congress returns next Tuesday from its August recess, according to top department officials. As consumer complaints against the airlines have soared, members of Congress have become increasingly critical of the department's handling of airline service and related issues. Consumer-protection legislation is pending in both the House and Senate.    Officials at the department and on Capitol Hill said they doubted that the issuance of the rule will forestall congressional action on the consumer-protection bills. &quot;Congress feels pressure to do something,&quot; said one Senate Commerce Committee aide. &quot;There is a lot of public support for disciplining the airlines.&quot;    Moreover, the department's rule almost certainly won't go as far as proposals being pushed by some in Congress. For example, the House Public Works and Transportation Committee in August approved consumer-protection legislation that directs the Federal Aviation Administration to determine the capacity of the nation's 40 biggest airports, and orders the transportation secretary to enforce the ceilings. The department opposes such a step.    The department rule, according to officials, will have three main parts:    --It will require airlines to disclose on a monthly basis how frequently flights are late or canceled, and the data will be made public. This action echoes old Civil Aeronautics Board rules, which required airlines to disclose their on-time performance each month.    --It will direct computerized reservation systems, which are used by travel agents to book flights, to indicate in some way which flights are most frequently on time and which ones are canceled most often.    --It will require the airlines to disclose how often their passengers' bags are lost.    Many major airlines have endorsed the principle of increased disclosure requirements in recent months, and the department's rule isn't expected to draw their ire. In July, 13 members of the Air Transport Association, the trade group for the major carriers, reached a voluntary agreement to disclose their on-time performance and baggage-handling records on a monthly basis. The group said the agreement, which had to be approved by the department, would make a rule unnecessary.    American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., didn't endorse the association pact because it believes mandatory disclosure is necessary -- a view shared by the department and many members of Congress.    The issuance of the department's rule will come on the heels of previously reported commitments from six major carriers to shuffle flights to reduce delays at four busy airports: Chicago's O'Hare, Atlanta's Hartsfield, Boston's Logan and Dallas/Fort Worth.    The department, which had conducted investigations into airline-scheduling practices at the four airports, is continuing its inquiries into scheduling practices at four other airports: Newark, N.J.; New York's La Guardia; Denver's Stapleton, and San Francisco.    The stepped-up efforts by the department and Congress to aid consumers occur amid rising frustration with airline deregulation, which has resulted in lower fares but increased headaches for fliers. As previously reported, consumer complaints against major U.S. airlines in July rose to 5,995, a six-fold increase from the year before, and a slight rise from June, according to the department. </TEXT></DOC>
