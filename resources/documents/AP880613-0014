(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The forces of Michael Dukakis andJesse Jackson are still miles apart on taxes, defense and manyforeign policy issues. But a preliminary platform-drafting sessionended with Jackson getting one wish: that the Democrats brand SouthAfrica a terrorist state.   The platform writers boarded this island's horse-drawn taxis andheaded home Sunday after three days of deliberations that producedworking papers on health, education, civil rights and other issues.The papers were generated by committee staff working withsurrogates of Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.   The papers on defense and foreign policy have yet to be written,and on taxes ``we agreed to disagree,'' said Michael Barnes, aformer Maryland congressman leading Dukakis's platform team.   The 16-member drafting committee left without casting any votes,but will meet again sometime before the full 186-member PlatformCommittee convenes in Denver June 25-26.   The Jackson forces encountered little opposition on the SouthAfrica issue, although earlier in the campaign, Dukakis balked whenJackson tried to extract such a pledge from him.   ``We have no problem declaring South Africa a terrorist state,but let's go beyond that,'' said Rep. Robert Matsui, a Dukakisbacker from California.   The Massachusetts governor, the certain nominee, favors passageof the tough sanctions in a bill that could put the apartheidregime in Johannesburg on the same U.S. list of terrorist states asLibya and Iran.   But the delegates parted company Sunday on another bedrock issuefor the Jackson campaign: whether to freeze Pentagon spending. Twolabor leaders rose to the defense of the defense budget and nucleardeterrence.   Rachelle Horowitz, political director of the American Federationof Teachers, said the Democrats must root out Pentagon waste, butalso ``honor our treaty obligations and defend democraticinstitutions and our freedoms.''   ``I hope this platform will call for a stable defense budget,''she said.   ``The defense budget is not a sacred cow,'' retorted LeslieMcLemore, a Jackson backer from Jackson State University inMississippi.   Later, when McLemore urged the party to forswear first use ofnuclear weapons, James B. Booe, secretary-treasurer of theCommunications Workers of America, said 40 years of bargaining hastaught him never to tell ``any adversary for sure I'm not going todo anything. ... I want to keep them off balance.''   The Democrats' working papers call for appointment of a federaldrug czar, an Equal Rights Amendment, ending homelessness,expanding AIDS research, and providing advance notice of plantclosings. Without using the word abortion, the civil rights papercalls for ``freedom of reproductive choice ... regardless ofability to pay.''   ``I found more areas of agreement than disagreement,'' said Rep.William Gray III of Pennsylvania, the drafting panel chair.   Those who hoped for divisive bloodletting ``will find the flooris clean,'' said Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's platform chief.She predicted it will be easier to reach an accord on defense thanon taxes.   ``If by `stable' they mean something close to what we mean by`freeze,' then perhaps there's room for compromise,'' Norton said.   Madeleine Albright, Dukakis foreign policy adviser, said: ``Ithink you will not see... `freeze' in the platform.   Janice Thurmond, an Athens, Ga., lawyer, urged that the platformembrace Jackson's views on self-determination for the Palestinians.Albright told reporters flatly the platform will not contain suchlanguage.   Robert Borosage, a senior Jackson adviser, said the Jackson campwill be insistent on its demand to further tax the rich and freezedefense spending.   ``We've got agreements with Dukakis on commitments for a wholerange of domestic programs, but where's the money going to comefrom?'' he said.   Barnes, the Dukakis platform team leader, was asked if theDukakis campaign would relish an opportunity in Atlanta to reject aminority plank favoring a tax hike.   ``We're not seeking floor fights,'' he said, adding that Jacksonhas enough delegates ``to take anything he wishes to theconvention.''</TEXT></DOC>
