In Maythe FTB sent me a demand letter for $950 with no explanation. I wrote to askwhy I owed this money. No answer. I tried calling the toll free number butdidn't get anyone to answer. I paid it on time hoping to clear the matter uplater this year. Then, 30 days later, I received a second notice for $65. Ipromptly paid this $65 but again had no idea why the money was owed; nor wouldthe FTB respond to my letters. Now I have received another bill for $65. Alongwith this notice was a letter from the FTB saying it was going to put a lienon my house and how it would garnishee my wages. I would love to try to clearthis up but have been getting nowhere. Maybe you can help me get someanswers.;   -- M.

Theproblem started when you claimed too much for state withholding. When the taxpeople reviewed your return, this excess amount was uncovered and thatresulted in the first bill for nearly $950. The official agrees that a lettershould have gone out to explain this to you. The first $65 bill you receivedcovered the interest and penalties owed on the bill, says the official. Thesecond $65 bill went out in error and you will receive no more bills from theFTB. Nor will the agency put a lien on your home or garnishee your wages.;  Refund just divine; Q  I have been trying since April to get a refund of$32.95 for a garment I returned to Divine Lines, 810 6th St., Brementon, Wash.I have called, written and filled out a claim form but am still without it.;  -- Z.J., King City; A  The refund went out the moment we contacted DivineLines.

Icomplained recently and was told someone would be in touch, but so far no onehas contacted me. The garbage collectors have it in for my trash cans.
