On Feb. 12, 1991, the BeijingIntermediate Court tried Wang Juntao and Chen Zimingseparately as the alleged masterminds and &quot;black hands&quot; ofthe democracy movement. Almost immediately following theclosed hearings, the court sentenced each to a total of 13years' imprisonment and four years' deprivation of politicalrights for the crimes of &quot;conspiring to subvert thegovernment&quot; and &quot;carrying out counterrevolutionary propagandaand incitement.&quot;   Despite the Chinese government's policy of closingpolitical trials to outside observers, records of WangJuntao's defense and verdict have come to light. In contrastto the usual practice of conceding guilt and arguing only forleniency in sentencing, Wang Juntao argued his innocence. Hislawyers, Sun Yachen and Zhang Sizhi, prepared an unusuallyvigorous defense in the four days allotted them before theproceeding. The two lawyers attacked the indictment and theprosecution's arguments as unsupported by the evidence andgrossly misleading.   Wang himself denied any culpability, and responded with ageneral defense of the democracy movement. According toreports he appeared thin and ill, and later wrote his lawyershe felt dizzy, his ears rang, and that he had difficultyfollowing the proceedings.   The prosecution's evidence, which took two and a halfhours to read, alleged that Wang Juntao and Chen Zimingconspired at an April 1989 symposium through statementscritical of the socialist system and leadership. It furtheralleged that at a subsequent meeting Wang suggested that apolitical party should be formed to control the democracymovement from behind the scenes, and that Wang, through the&quot;Protect the Constitution Committee,&quot; was implicated in astatement declaring martial law a &quot;fascist terrorist&quot; tactic.The prosecution also charged Wang with efforts to blocktroops who were trying to enter Beijing and anti-governmentleafletting in Tiananmen Square. Although the defensestatement that follows challenged the basis of eachaccusation, the court closely adhered to the prosecution'sline of argument in its verdict, which was announced a merehour after the close of argument.   Both Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming have appealed theirverdicts, Wang requesting his lawyers to represent him onappeal. However, Wang's lawyers reportedly have come undergovernment pressure not to continue their representation. SunYachen, a lawyer from Luoyang, Henan province, took WangJuntao's case in defiance of instructions from the Ministryof Justice. When Sun returned to Luoyang after the trial wasover, the Ministry forbade him from handling the appeal.Zhang Sizhi, Wang's Beijing counsel, declined to representWang on appeal.   {After this report was issued, Mr. Wang's appeal, arguedby his wife, Hou Xiaotian, was rejected.}                                                                                                          From the Defense:                                                                                                          The indictment totally avoids mentioning the historicalbackground. Yet that background is of utmost importance.   {When protesters began occupying Tiananmen Square}, theUnited Front Department of the Central Committee of theCommunist Party and its leader Yan Mingfu sent Zheng Yefu andothers to invite Wang Juntao et al. to get involvedimmediately in the disturbance and serve as a bridge betweenthe students and the government in order to get the studentsto leave the square so that the visiting Gorbachev could beproperly welcomed, and then to go one step further to calmthe disturbance down.   It was precisely at the suggestion of high-level officialsof the party that Wang Juntao et al. changed their posturefrom non-involvement in the past to involvement. They beganto consider ways to &quot;influence the students throughspeeches.&quot; For that purpose they considered it necessary togo among the students. It was a practical plan designed tofulfill the task assigned to them by the party. Now all thisis construed as &quot;secret conspiracy.&quot;   (See related editorial: &quot;I Fight for Principles&quot; -- WSJMarch 26, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
