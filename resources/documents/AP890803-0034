In a preliminary 259-169 vote, the House decided Wednesday tomake permanent the ban on smoking aboard airline flights of twohours or less. The restriction, covering four of five U.S. routes,would otherwise expire next April.   With that same vote, however, lawmakers refused to consider aproposal that would have expanded the ban to cover all domesticU.S. flights.   The provision was part of the $11.9 billion spending bill forfiscal 1990, beginning Oct. 1, for federal transportation programs.A vote on final approval of the overall legislation was planned fortoday, which would send it to the Senate.   Meanwhile, the House adopted a separate bill Wednesdayincreasing federal expenditures for AIDS research, prevention andtreatment to $1.6 billion next year _ 25 percent higher than thisyear.   The same measure halts plans for a government survey of Americansexual habits, a study officials had hoped would give them cluesabout how sexually transmitted diseases spread.   Tobacco interests did little to block the smoking ban extension,reasoning that allowing the ban to become permanent would preventanti-smoking forces from seeking to expand it every time the lawexpired.   ``A lot of members simply wanted to be rid of the issue,'' saidWalker Merryman, vice president of the Tobacco Institute, theindustry's lobbying arm in Washington.   ``We recognize the realities of politics,'' said Rep. WalterJones, D-N.C., whose district is one of the country's largestproducers of tobacco. ``This is the best compromise we can get.''   The tobacco industry has argued that opponents' claims of healthproblems caused by secondary smoke inhaled by non-smokers areunproven, and that the ban is bad for business.   Supporters of the ban, backed by health groups and airlineemployee unions, argued that smoking kills hundreds of thousands ofpeople annually, and that secondary smoke kills 5,000 more.   ``Tell me a more important health issue,'' said Rep. RichardDurbin, D-Ill., sponsor of the ban proposals. ``Tell me a moreimportant life and death issue.''   Durbin is the author of the law enacted in 1987. At that time,the House passed a permanent ban on smoking aboard flights of twohours or less. It was watered down to a two-year prohibition by theSenate, where senators from tobacco-growing states hold influentialpositions.   The AIDS spending was contained in legislation providing $155.2billion for fiscal 1990 for labor, health and educationinitiatives. The bill was approved 365-58 and sent to the Senate.   The $11 million survey of American sexual preferences was soughtby the Public Health Service, which has complained that the mostcurrent statistics on the subject are from the 1948 Kinsey Report.   But conservatives in the Bush administration and in Congresshave said enough is already known about the sexual transmission ofAIDS and that the questionnaire would be an invasion of privacy. Apreliminary survey form asked participants whether their mostrecent sexual partner was male or female, and what they thoughtabout masturbation and oral sex.   More than 100,000 Americans have been diagnosed as having AIDS,and more than 58,000 of them have died, according to the Centersfor Disease Control.</TEXT></DOC>
