(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Union meatpackers say they will appeal afederal court verdict that found illegal a six-month strike outsideJohn Morrell andamp; Co.'s Sioux Falls plant last year which erupted inviolence several times.   A jury in a $40 million lawsuit brought by the company againstLocal 304A of the United Food and Commercial Workers ruled Thursdaythat union members' refusal to cross a picket line set up bymembers of another local was a violation of their contract.   A new jury will be picked this summer or fall to decide theamount of damages, if any, that are due Morrell.   Union officials are confident they will win on appeal, AllenZack, a spokesman in Washington.   The jury had been asked to determine whether a May 1 walkout atthe Sioux Falls plant was a sympathy strike and whether the currentcontract allowed the strike.   About 2,500 Local 304A members in Sioux Falls refused to cross apicket line set up May 1 by striking Morrell workers from SiouxCity, Iowa.   The strike led to rock-throwing, vandalism and other incidentsof picket-line violence during its early days. A state judge issuedan injunction against the union because of the violence.   The company argued that the work stoppage was a primary, oreconomic strike and not a sympathy strike and that the strikersbroke their contract because they were concerned about possiblewage cuts.   The jury agreed with the union's contention that the workstoppage was a sympathy strike. But it agreed with the company'sposition that all strikes are illegal under Morrell's contract withLocal 304A.   Union leaders testified that the no-strike clause in thecontract prohibited Sioux Falls workers from striking over issuesin their contract but that the May 1 strike was not over the SiouxFalls pact.   Morrell hired replacement workers at both its Sioux Falls andSioux City plants.   U.S. District Judge Richard Battey of Rapid City presided.</TEXT></DOC>
