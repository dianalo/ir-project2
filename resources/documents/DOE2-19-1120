Marketing, public relations and media expertisewill be needed to successfully introduce this new processing choice toretailers and consumers. Consumer research to date including studiesconducted in the Netherlands, United States, South Africa and Canadawill be explored for signposts to successful approaches to the introductionof irradiated foods to retailers and consumers. Research has indicatedthat the terms used to describe irradiation and information designedto reduce consumer fears will be important marketing tools. Marketerswill be challenged to promote old foods which look the same to consumers,in a new light. Simple like or dislike or intention to buy surveys willnot be effective tools. Consumer fears must be identified and effectivelyhandled to support a receptive climate for irradiated food products.A cooperative government, industry, professional organization, consumerorganization and retailer effort will be necessary for a successful introductionof irradiated foods into the marketplace.
