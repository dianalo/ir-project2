Atlanta Coca-Cola bottling received subpoenas last month for documents relating to the pricing practices of its Athens and Cornelia, Ga., operations, the Atlanta-based soft drink bottling concern disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing connected with a debt offering.    The company declined to elaborate on the disclosure.    Coca-Cola Enterprises, which is 49% owned by Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co., previously said in its initial offering prospectus that the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice Department was investigating allegations of price fixing in the industry. The prospectus said the investigation focused on various parts of the country, including territories where certain of the Coca-Cola Enterprises bottling units conduct business.    The investigation has already resulted in the conviction of an employee of Allegheny Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. Coca-Cola Enterprises said its Mid-Atlantic Coca-Cola Bottling Co. may also be indicted in a continuing investigation in that case.    In January, Mid-Atlantic Bottling was added as a defendant in a separate civil class-action suit filed by a customer of Allegheny Pepsi-Cola Bottling, Coca-Cola Enterprises said.    Atlanta Coca-Cola Bottling purchased Athens Coca-Cola Bottling Co. -- the territories that include Athens and Cornelia, Ga. -- in 1985. Should the grand jury investigation result &quot;in proceedings, fines or damages&quot; against Atlanta Coca-Cola Bottling, the unit may have a claim for indemnity against the sellers of the Athens bottling concern under the terms of the purchase agreement, Coca-Cola Enterprises said in the filing.    Coca-Cola Co., the previous owner of the various Coca-Cola bottling units, entered into an indemnity agreement with Coca-Cola Enterprises prior to the initial offering providing reimbursements to the company should the investigations result in criminal or civil fines.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Coca-Cola Enterprises closed at $17.125 a share, down 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
