This time, it was not soldiers who challenged the government, butcivilian commandos the government said were leftist guerrillas.   ``The risk for Argentina is being caught in pincers between theleft and the right,'' said Juan Manuel Cassella, the vicepresidential candidate of the ruling Radical Civic Union in theelections set for next May 14.   The assault called to mind not the military insurrections ofApril 1987, and January and December 1988, but attacks in the late1960s and 1970s on army bases by leftist guerrillas such as theMontoneros and the Peoples Revolutionary Army.   The commandos either carried with them or stole and put to useground-to-ground missiles and anti-tank guns, military officialssaid in explaining how 30 to 50 commandos held off hundreds ofsoldiers and police backed by tanks and mortars for more than 15hours.   In January 1974, about 100 Peoples Revolutionary Army guerrillastried to take over the 10th armored cavalry arsenal at Azul, 248miles south of Buenos Aires. The attack was repulsed.   In December 1975, the same group attacked Battalion 601 in MonteChingolo, 9 miles northwest of the capital.   ERP, as the so-called revolutionary army is known by its Spanishacronym, and the Montoneros formed in the late 1960s to oppose themilitary regime then in power.   Their assassinations, bombings and kidnappings continued underthe elected government of Juan Domingo Peron in 1973, destabilizingit and setting the stage for the military coup of March 1976.   The new military rulers met the leftist subversion head-on,fighting ERP guerrillas in the mountains of northwest TucumanProvince. At least 8,900 Argentines were arrested by security forcesand never seen again. They are presumed executed.   That so-called ``dirty war'' divides Argentine society to thisday. Military officers charged with human rights abuses say theyused unconventional tactics, including torture, to deal with anunconventional threat. Human rights groups said the armed forcescommitted genocide.   Five members of the three juntas that ruled from 1976 untilPresident Raul Alfonsin's election in October 1983 were convicted ofhuman rights abuses and sentenced to long terms in prison.   About 20 officers are under prosecution.   The leaders of the three military insurrections, cashiered Lt.Col. Aldo Rico and Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, demanded that thoseofficers convicted be given an amnesty and trials for the otherscalled off.   The government and the opposition Peronist Party have refusedboth demands. Rico and Seineldin currently are in military prisonawaiting trial.   All three insurrections ended with little shooting or bloodshed.</TEXT></DOC>
