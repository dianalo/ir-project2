As maintenanceequipment, the automatic fitting equipment of low-snow coating rings,and remote measuring with a helicopter are presented. More applicationsof OPGW and more uses of robots for the maintenance services are pointedout as future trends. Present automated maintenance services for undergroundtransmission lines are outlined, and in addition, the communication systemof the oil leakage information of OF cables or failure information ofcooling facilities, the automatic operation and monitoring system forcooling facilities, and the duct monitoring system to collect and montoroperation, failure and control imformation are presented. The use ofinspection robots and a computerized total facility management systemare pointed out as future trends. (7 figs, 3 tabs, 3 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
