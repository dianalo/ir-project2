Warner liable for $22.7 million in damages to the trustee for E.S.M. Government Securities Inc.    E.S.M. collapsed in March 1985 and various of its officers have been convicted of criminal fraud charges in state and federal court. At the time, the firm owed customers some $320 million, and a federal bankruptcy court appointed a trustee to recoup money for E.S.M.'s creditors, most of which are municipalities.    The trustee, C. Thomas Tew, filed a federal civil lawsuit here against Mr. Warner, charging, among other things, that the financier had inside knowledge of E.S.M.'s financial woes and received preferential treatment when the firm allowed him to recoup his investment shortly before it collapsed.    After a 3 1/2-week trial, the jury determined that Mr. Warner was an &quot;insider&quot; of E.S.M. and had participated in the firm's &quot;fraudulent purpose.&quot;    Earlier this week, the judge in the case, U.S. District Judge Jose A. Gonzalez Jr., threw out other charges against Mr. Warner in the suit, including fraud, racketeering, civil theft and unjust enrichment. The jury's verdict, however, was related to a &quot;fraudulent conveyance&quot; under federal bankruptcy law.    Mr. Warner said he will appeal the verdict. &quot;I'm extremely disappointed. I feel terrible,&quot; he said.    Mr. Warner, a former U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, owned Cincinnati-based Home State Savings Bank, which had invested heavily with E.S.M. and failed on the heels of E.S.M.'s collapse.    He faces a barrage of other civil suits related to his dealings with E.S.M. as well as three felony counts in Ohio state court related to his family's loans at Home State.    Mr. Warner was found innocent of all federal criminal charges against him in connection with E.S.M. in a trial in Ann Arbor, Mich., last year. He was convicted on nine felony charges in an Ohio state court, also related to E.S.M., but is appealing that verdict for a variety of reasons, including alleged juror misconduct. </TEXT></DOC>
