In the next few days, analysts say, the California Public Utilities Commission staff is expected to give preliminary support to a sweeping plan for &quot;incentive regulation&quot; of the telecommunications company, thereby removing a number of restrictions, including the ceiling on profit of its Pacific Bell telephone business.    In exchange, the San Francisco-based company would open some of its monopoly markets to competition. And it would return to consumers half of any profit that exceeds an agreed-upon rate of return.    Analysts generally believe the proposal will be adopted this fall. As a result, they predict, Pacific Telesis stock could rise from yesterday's close of 43 1/4 to trade in the neighborhood of $48 to $52 a share within six months -- a jump of 11% to 20% -- as the company's earnings growth returns to healthier levels.    &quot;This action would definitely be positive,&quot; Paul G. Aran of Bear Stearns says. &quot;We expect PacTel's stock price would go up and the company would definitely perform better in terms of earnings.&quot;    Ronald Altman, chairman of Altman Brenner Wasserman, a New York research firm, says: &quot;I think this is a done deal. I don't sense any philosophical objections to an incentive plan.&quot;    Since the breakup of the Bell System in 1984, the hard-line, consumer-minded stance of the California commission has been a source of apprehension for Wall Street analysts as they debated Pacific Telesis' long-term prospects. But last September, there were modest signs that the commission's posture toward the company might be starting to soften.    Pacific Telesis won approval then to reduce its rates on Centrex switchboard services, private lines and custom-calling features, such as call forwarding. The company viewed this change as vital; many large customers had taken their business elsewhere.    Now the momentum toward regulatory easing appears to be building. Commission staff members say the agency's preliminary report on the incentive proposal will run about 350 pages, an indication that it will be an affirmative document crammed with implementation details.    Mr. Altman of Altman Brenner says he is convinced the commission &quot;already knows what it wants to do,&quot; because its president is a former top aide to California Gov. George Deukmejian, who has gone on record in favor of such incentives.    In exchange for incentive regulation, Pacific Bell is offering to freeze basic residential telephone rates through 1992, extend local calling areas to 12 miles from eight for flat-rate billing, provide touchtone service free of extra charges, and spend as much as $700 million to upgrade its network with digital switches.    The company also wants to raise basic business telephone rates gradually to reflect actual costs, and to gain flexibility to reduce prices for other business services to meet competition.    At the same time, the commission has been considering alternative proposals, by GTE Corp.'s GTE California unit and the commission's ratepayer advocates division, that rates be indexed to inflation and expected productivity increases.    The commission could combine aspects of the different proposals. All of them have important points in common: They all rely on price caps and on an equal split by the company and consumers of any profits that exceed a certain threshold.    Jack Grubman, who follows the industry for PaineWebber, says Pacific Telesis stock will rise with incentive regulation. But he isn't revising his per-share profit estimates of $3.15 for this year and $3.40 for 1990, because the details of the plan aren't known.    Mr. Grubman says he doesn't expect Pacific Telesis to have the extensive revenue loss projected by Nynex, another Bell operating company, as a result of similar revisions adopted in New York in 1987. Some analysts say Nynex didn't react quickly enough to competition and a slowing economy. In contrast, Pacific Telesis has won back many private-line and Centrex customers since it gained the right to reduce rates. California's booming economy helped give Pacific Telesis the highest second-quarter growth in access lines among the Baby Bells.    But the California commission could order a rate cut if it decides Pacific Bell's rate of return already exceeds the proposed profit-splitting threshold. If such a reduction is ordered, &quot;I might cut my earnings estimate for 1990,&quot; says Robert Morris III of Goldman Sachs, who rates Pacific Telesis stock a hold. The shares' 51% rise in the past 12 months is the highest among the Baby Bells and compares with 41.5% for telephone utilities as a group. &quot;The market,&quot; he says, &quot;is buying PacTel more for the potential for deregulation than for this year's earnings.&quot; ---    Pacific Telesis    (NYSE; Symbol: PAC)    Business: Telecommunications    Year ended Dec. 31, 1988:    Revenue: $9.48 billion    Net Income: $1.19 billion; $2.81 a share    Second Quarter, June 30, 1989:    Per-share earnings: 79 cents vs. 76 cents    Average daily trading volume:    648,169 shares    Common shares outstanding: 412.5 million </TEXT></DOC>
