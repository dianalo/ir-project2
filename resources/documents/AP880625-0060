The Cabinet changes, Gandhi's 13th since he took office in 1984,followed setbacks for his Congress Party in last week'sparliamentary elections.   By divesting himself of the foreign minister's job, Gandhi canturn fuller attention to the challenge posed by his chief politicalrival, former Defense Minister V.P. Singh.   Singh, who broke with the prime minister last year over thegovernment's slowness in investigating allegations that bribes werepaid in foreign arms deals, won a parliamentary seat in theAllahabad district.   He easily defeated the Congress Party candidate by a 2-to-1majority, boosting his chances of opposing Gandhi himself fornational leadership in the coming 18 months.   National elections must be conducted no later than January 1990.   Asked today whether ``panic'' over Singh's Allahabad victory wasthe reason for the Cabinet reshuffle, Gandhi replied: ``Not at all... Do I look panicky?''   He said he would not resign and would not call an early election.   The country's two national news agencies, the United News ofIndia and the Press Trust of India, quoted the prime minister assaying he wanted to devote more time to political work.   Gandhi assigned the post of foreign minister to P.V. NarasimhaRao, who had served as minister of human resource development inthe last Cabinet.   He was one of nine men given new Cabinet-level responsibilitiesin the reshuffle. All are Congress Party veteran politicians.   Two of the new Cabinet members, Finance Minister S.B. Chavan andCommerce Minister Bir Bahadur Singh, stepped down as chiefministers of Indian states on Friday following allegations they hadbeen inept in upholding the Congress Party banner.   Their inclusion 24 hours later in Gandhi's new Cabinet brought ascathing retort from L.K. Advani, president of a right-wingopposition group, the Bharatiya Janata Party. He called the newCabinet ``a waste basket of rejected chief ministers,'' PTIreported.   Bir Bahadur Singh was chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, where theCongress Party lost one parliamentary seat and two state assemblyseats to opposition candidates in the June 16 elections.   Chavan was chief minister of Maharashtra, where a militant Hinduparty, the right-wing Shiv Sena, won recent city council electionsin Bombay, the state capital.   Since Gandhi took office in 1984 following the assassination ofhis mother and predecessor, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, theCongress Party has lost 10 of 14 state elections.   In another key Cabinet appointment, Baburao Shankaranand wasnamed minister of law, justice and water resources.   Shankaranand was water resources minister in a previous Cabinetbut resigned last summer to head a parliamentary investigation thatkickbacks were paid to facilitate India's purchases of artilleryguns from the Swedish company, Bofors. The investigation concludedthere was no evidence that kickbacks were paid.   Following new reports this week in the daily newspaper, Hindu,that commissions were paid in the Bofors deal, Gandhi said he hadasked the Central Bureau of Investigation to look into the matter.   The Cabinet now has 20 members, including Gandhi who retainsresponsibility for science and technology, atomic energy and space.The last Cabinet had 16 members.</TEXT></DOC>
