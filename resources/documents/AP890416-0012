Last summer, officials said there were at least 50 hijackattempts in the Soviet Union over the past 15 years. However, theweekly magazine Ogonyok, which published the new report, did notsay how many of the weapons seized in 1988 were linked to attemptedhijackings.   The magazine claimed all Soviet hijack attempts were motivatedby a desire to leave the country or by personal greed. It said inthe West, people usually commandeer planes for political reasons.   Several recent hijackings and attempted hijackings in the SovietUnion have made international news.   On March 30, a man demanding $855,000 and a flight to Pakistantried to hijack a Soviet airliner carrying 75 passengers to theCaspian seaport of Baku. He was subdued and no one was injured.   Authorities described that would-be hijacker as a fugitive fromthe law.   In December, four hijackers commandeered a Soviet school bus,and officials provided them with an Ilyushin 76-T transport planethat flew them to Israel. They were arrested there and sent back tothe Soviet Union, where they were given prison sentences rangingfrom 13 to 15 years.   The magazine said in its Sunday report that more than 250 guns,900 pounds of explosives, and 86,177 knives and other weapons wereconfiscated at Soviet airports last year.   Ogonyok suggested that the best way to avoid hijackings wassimply to give a ticket to anyone who wants to leave the country.   ``Why are we still stubbornly defending the rules that do notpermit the uneducated, idle people, drug addicts and criminals toleave the country and go wherever they want?'' the magazine asked.</TEXT></DOC>
