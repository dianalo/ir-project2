They were his shock troops as he slashed taxes and doubled the defense budget. They have driven the Republican Party -- and the Democratic Party as well -- to the right.    So what's the mood among conservatives as Republicans gather here to celebrate the past and to launch George Bush?    &quot;Morose,&quot; says former Reagan political director Mitch Daniels.    &quot;Somewhat depressed,&quot; says Gary Bauer, a prominent conservative on the White House staff. &quot;Uneasy,&quot; says Charles Kesler, a conservative academic who has just edited a book on conservative thought.    A curious malaise -- frustration mingled with a sense of opportunities lost -- grips many conservative leaders amid the balloon drops and staged euphoria here. They are lukewarm about Mr. Bush and apprehensive about Michael Dukakis. They utterly dominate the GOP, yet they fear some of their gains are tenuous, or even illusory.    Without the unifying force of Mr. Reagan, strains are developing as different types of conservatives press differing agendas for the future. Economic conservatives champion small government and low taxes. Social conservatives worry about drugs, abortion and preserving traditional family values. Foreign-policy conservatives are preoccupied with aiding Nicaragua's Contras and deploying the Strategic Defense Initiative.    Few conservatives regard Vice President Bush as one of them. He is seen instead as a closet moderate who now pays lip service to conservative priorities. Says New Hampshire Sen. Gordon Humphrey, the leader of a group at the GOP convention that pushed for the choice of a conservative vice presidential candidate: &quot;George Bush, left to his own devices, would prefer the Thornburghs, the Bradys and the Keans&quot; -- the old moderate wing of the party. The cultural gap between the aristocratic Mr. Bush and &quot;movement&quot; conservatives -- who tend to be populists of blue-collar extraction -- is enormous.    Mr. Bush tried to go part of the way toward bridging that gap yesterday by picking Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle as his running mate. While New York Rep. Jack Kemp would have been a more popular choice among conservatives, Sen. Quayle is regarded as an acceptable compromise.    &quot;We could have done a lot worse,&quot; says Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus. He praised the Indiana senator's votes against the Legal Services Administration and against abortion. But Richard Viguerie, a fund-raiser and leader of the New Right, says that while Mr. Quayle is friendly with conservatives, he won't bring many prominent conservatives with him into the Bush camp.    Some are disillusioned with Ronald Reagan himself. They believe he ultimately betrayed or undercut their most cherished causes -- by embracing Mikhail Gorbachev, negotiating an arms-reduction treaty, and bungling aid to the Contras and the Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork.    &quot;I think Reagan lost his vision,&quot; says Amy Moritz, a young conservative activist who got her start in politics by campaigning for Mr. Reagan in 1980, and who now directs the National Center for Public Policy Research.    But most, including Ms. Moritz, also blame themselves. They say conservatives waited far too long to begin building a grass-roots political organization for the post-Reagan era, one that would institutionalize his policies.    &quot;We had grown up in opposition. We weren't prepared for governing,&quot; says Georgia GOP Rep. Newt Gingrich, a provocative New Right tactician. &quot;It's the difference between flying a Beechcraft Bonanza and a 747.&quot;    &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt made institutional changes that forever changed the political landscape of the country. We haven't done that,&quot; says Paul Weyrich, the president of the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation. He dismisses much of the supposed Reagan legacy as &quot;an illusion.&quot;    Some argue that people like Mr. Weyrich are so inherently gloomy they can't recognize victory when it has hit them in the face. &quot;Liberalism, egalitarianism, redistribution of wealth, socialism are all on the decline,&quot; says Rep. Kemp. &quot;Is there some pessimism? Yeah. But the nature of any movement is to be measured by the strength of its ideas, and I would say most of the new ideas are coming out of the conservative or progressive-conservative movements in the world.&quot;    Democrats, by their own admission, are going out of their way to avoid what President Reagan calls the &quot;L-word&quot;: Liberal. &quot;Conservatives have swept the ideological battlefield,&quot; agrees Michael Novak, an American Enterprise Institute resident scholar.    Yet the conservative movement has always been complex and anything but monolithic: Mr. Novak talks of five basic conservative types, three of which are &quot;anticapitalist&quot; at heart. George Bush, unlike Mr. Reagan, doesn't transcend these differences. Thus some of the leaders who helped Mr. Reagan to his landslide victories don't seem inclined to break their backs for Mr. Bush this year.    Mr. Viguerie estimates that, even after the selection of Mr. Quayle as a running mate, conservatives will work only about 20% as hard for Mr. Bush as they did for Mr. Reagan in 1980 and 1984. &quot;They'll vote, but why should they work for it very hard?&quot;    But the issues go far beyond the question of George Bush's future. For despite nearly eight years of White House control, conservatives still see themselves as struggling to consolidate their position -- to govern.    &quot;I feel we're back to 1977,&quot; says Norman Podhoretz, the neo-conservative editor of Commentary magazine. &quot;A lot of the old illusions that some of us fought so hard against are back in repackaged form.&quot; He predicts that it will take &quot;a generation at least&quot; to make basic changes in a culture still &quot;shaped by the ideas, attitudes and ideologies&quot; of the left.    Conservative factionalism -- some would say parochialism -- complicates the task. &quot;Each {conservative type} has one or two solutions to the Republic's problems: Supply-side Economics! Traditional Family Values! The Eternal Verities!&quot; wrote a bemused R. Emmett Tyrell Jr., editor in chief of The American Spectator magazine. &quot;. . . Beyond their one or two wonder cures, they lose interest.&quot;    Some conservatives complain that President Reagan could have done far more to fuse the separate strands of conservatism. &quot;The administration had a fixation on {congressional} victories at any price,&quot; argues Mr. Weyrich. &quot;The idea of his image makers was that he had to seem invincible. That's nonsense. Each year Reagan has been in office, he's gotten weaker. Each year Margaret Thatcher has been in office, she's gotten stronger. That's because she had a plan.&quot;    In this context, the 1984 Reagan campaign represents both a watershed and a squandered opportunity. Largely ignoring issues and his party's conservative platform, Mr. Reagan ran an essentially issueless campaign based on his own popularity. &quot;What you had was a personal victory of immense proportions,&quot; says Edwin Feulner, the president of the conservative Heritage Foundation. &quot;But you didn't have a policy mandate.&quot;    Lack of a conservative mandate, Mr. Feulner and others say, helped undermine GOP candidates two years later, when the party lost control of the Senate. That, in turn, led to bitter defeats on the Bork nomination, Contra aid and defense spending.    Now, conservatives worry that some gains they have made could be undone or at least contained by a Dukakis administration. Mr. Reagan already has put his stamp on the federal judiciary and, more tenuously, on the Supreme Court. Yet conservatives shudder at the thought that elderly justices such as Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun and William Brennan might all be &quot;putting their resignations in the Bible on the inaugural stand&quot; as Mr. Dukakis is sworn in, says Mr. Daniels, the former Reagan political director.    The net result is that many conservatives think they face a shaking-out period, when new leaders and galvanizing issues must emerge to re-energize the movement.    Ms. Moritz recently shook Washington conservatives by publishing an article entitled &quot;Conservatism's Parched Grass Roots,&quot; arguing that the opportunity to build a nationwide conservative network had been &quot;squandered.&quot; She places much of the blame on established conservative leaders, charging that they &quot;were into high salaries, egos and being in newspapers,&quot; rather than building political networks. Longtime activists like Mr. Viguerie and Mr. Phillips, she says, grew so accustomed to sniping at government while in the political wilderness that they &quot;seem to function best in opposition.&quot;    Younger activists are encouraged because they think they are starting to propose more positive solutions to everyday problems, a process by which they hope to eventually bury the image of conservatives as perpetual naysayers whose main goal is simply to block liberals' big-government plans.    Mr. Gingrich, for instance, sees &quot;an explosion of conservative ideas,&quot; such as an approach to child care proposed by young conservatives and recently embraced by Mr. Bush. Rather than establish federally financed day-care centers, their proposal offers tax credits that low-income parents can use either to cut the cost of private child-care programs or to help meet the costs of raising a family if the mother chooses to stay at home. The emerging conservative approach is to offer &quot;empowerment and choice to help you solve your problems, vs. the left-wing approach that treats you as a client,&quot; says Mr. Gingrich.    &quot;Some of those young groups . . . are loaded for bear and ready to fight for things,&quot; says Mr. Bauer. By contrast, he says, &quot;a number of groups around the country . . . seem to be able to function properly only if they are in opposition. I think some of those groups in the next few years may fold up.&quot;    Among officeholders, Mr. Gingrich and Education Secretary William Bennett have already moved into positions of prominence and are likely to become more influential. At the intellectual vanguard of the movement will be such conservatives as Ms. Moritz, William Kristol -- Mr. Bennett's one-time chief of staff -- White House domestic policy aide Dinesh D'Souza and Frank Gaffney, a former Pentagon official who resigned to protest the INF treaty.    Mr. Weyrich, despite his misgivings about the Reagan years, is heartened by signs that the grass-roots conservative network, absent so far, finally might begin taking shape. He points to groups of young conservative activists making an impact in states such as Pennsylvania, Texas and even staunchly liberal Massachusetts. &quot;The movement is back to the states, not to Washington,&quot; he says. &quot;I am happier than I have been in a decade.&quot;    Some conservative organizations have built a base in Washington during the Reagan years that will allow them to exercise influence well after Mr. Reagan returns to California. The prime example is the Heritage Foundation, whose annual budget has more than tripled since 1980, to $14.3 million, and whose staff has more than doubled, to 130.    Yet even Mr. Feulner, the foundation's president, cautions that conservatives will need more time to build the kind of lasting power they covet. &quot;FDR came along and enunciated the New Deal in the 1930s,&quot; he says. &quot;It didn't culminate until the 1960s Great Society. . . . There's no such thing as a quick fix.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
