 Widearea network features such as enhanced communication capabilitiesand administration and security functions are showing up on LANoperating systems.andP;  Some of the new features that have been addedto LANs are electronic mail capabilities, network alert systems,network disk storage administration, user record resources,network fault finding capabilities and the ability to monitor thescreen activity on one station from another station.andP;

 Going beyond sharingperipherals and exchanging data, LAN software is becoming the glue that makesworkstations, servers and even multiple networks work together.andP;  Enhancedcommunication capabilities and administration and security functions drawnfrom wide area networks (WANs) are attracting new attention to maturing LANoperating systems.andM;Hardware determines certain network characteristics, such as maximum speed.andO;For example, the right interface card is a prerequisite for compatibilitywith a given computer.andP;  But software support constitutes the other ingredientof compatibility, allowing the operating system to determine how the networklooks to users and what functions it can perform.andM;&quot;As networks become more and more mature, people want to do more things withthem,&quot; said Chris Hawkinson, president of LAN vendor SimpleNet Systems Inc.andO;in Brea, Calif.andM;Those tasks include sending electronic mail, querying central databases andrunning software on a server rather than on individual workstations.andM;&quot;[Today's operating systems are] emulating a minicomputer's operating systema lot more closely with each release,&quot; said Sean Walsh, seniorprogrammer/analyst at the mailing products and systems division of PitneyBowes Inc. in Stamford, Conn.andP;  Pitney Bowes has more than 200 workstationsconnected through an Advanced NetWare LAN from Novell Inc.andM;Taking on Mini FunctionsandM;&quot;More and more of the functions of the mini are being shifted over onto theLAN,&quot; said Doug Kane, director of information systems at the law firmWickens, Herzer and Panca in Cleveland.andP;  The reason, Kane believes, is thatusers prefer the flexibility of network software.andM;When the finance division of Chemical Bank in New York installed a 3Com Corp.andO;3+Share network in 1984, &quot;the idea was to save money on hard disks andprinters,&quot; said Martin Schwimmer, division vice president.andP;  Later, bankdivisions began sharing modems and mainframe access.andP;  Now Schwimmer isworking on using Structured Query Language to get data from central databasesmaintained by the bank.andM;Schwimmer is also thinking about sharing processor power through the network.andM;With 3Com's 3+Open operating system, which is based on the OS/2 LAN Managerdeveloped by 3Com and Microsoft Corp., &quot;I should be able to initiateapplications on the PC in OS/2 and have some of the processing and thecomputation done on the server,&quot; he said.andM;PC-based communication through a LAN goes beyond the traditional functions toencompass micro-to-mainframe links, access to remote systems such as on-linedatabases and even the transmittal of facsimile messages.andP;  &quot;Network softwareis going to move toward integrating all that into a totally electronicenvironment,&quot; claimed SimpleNet's Hawkinson.andM;SimpleNet's MicroLINK operating system already has electronic mail and PC-faxsupport as options.andP;  The next step will probably be to integratemicro-to-mainframe links, said Hawkinson.andM;Sun Microsystems Inc. plans to bundle a messaging function called InBox withits TOPS LAN operating system.andP;  &quot;Five years from now, I think we're going tosee an awful lot of electronic mail, an awful lot of messaging in the workgroup and across organizations,&quot; said Rich Shapero, vice president andgeneral manager of Sun's TOPS division, in Berkeley, Calif.andM;As LANs grow and gain new features, they can also become more complex tomanage.andP;  Fortunately, some of the capabilities being added to networksoftware include help for LAN administrators.andM;The move to give networking software more functions to aid the administratoris &quot;probably driven by the advent of very large wide area networks, whereit's an absolute necessity,&quot; said Janel Killheffer, marketing manager forCorvus Systems Inc., a LAN hardware and software vendor in San Jose, Calif.andM;Rick Rebo, vice president of research and development at 10Net Communicationsof Dayton, Ohio, a division of DCA Inc., agreed.andP;  His company, which developsboth wide area and local area networking products, is incorporatingadministration and security features from wide area networking into its LANsoftware.andM;&quot;You will see a lot of powerful things from the WAN world,&quot; Rebo said.andO;Future features are expected to include the ability to view a map of thenetwork that shows current activity, a facility for pinpointing networkfaults, detailed records of each user's use of resources and securityprovisions.andM;Other LAN operating systems offer a variety of administrative features.andO;Systems based on the OS/2 LAN Manager -- including 3Com's 3+Open and TorusSystems Inc.'s Tapestry II -- incorporate network alert systems that sound awarning when a printer needs paper or when a disk is almost filled.andP;  In itsmost recent releases, Novell's NetWare allows LAN administrators to rationnetwork disk storage -- permitting the creation of storage quotas for eachuser -- and to charge resource use to users or departments.andM;In another development, the virtual console feature in Corvus' PC-NOS LANoperating software allows one station on a network to monitor screen activityon, or to take control of, another station.andM;Bigger LANs aren't necessarily better for everyone, though.andP;  WaterlooMicrosystems Inc., for example, is targeting its Port Lite LAN software atsmall organizations and work groups without technical expertise, said IanTelford, director of strategic planning for the Norcross, Ga., firm.andP;  In thatmarket, Telford said, ease of use is the paramount concern.andM;----------Grant Buckler is a Toronto-based free-lance writer covering the computerindustry.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
