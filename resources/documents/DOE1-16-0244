At low excitation energies, S/sub nn/ is below the free value.At excitation energies near 40 MeV for scattering between about 5{sup0} and 9{sup 0}, S/sub nn/ is significantly larger than the free values.These results suggest that the relative {Delta}S = 1/({Delta}S = 0+{Delta}S= 1) nuclear spin response approaches about 90% in the region of theenhancement.</TEXT></DOC>
