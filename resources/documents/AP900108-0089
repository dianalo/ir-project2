(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Students at public colleges anduniversities should be kicked out of school for conviction of anydrug offense, Gov. Kay Orr proposed today.   The Orr anti-drug plan, proposed in her annual state of thestate message, also would require students who enter public highereducation to certify they will be drug free before they can enrollor receive state student aid.   They would lose the aid and be expelled from school for any drugconviction, including misdemeanors, and could re-enter school onlyafter completing a drug rehabilitation program.   ``I want to make it crystal clear,'' said Mrs. Orr, a Republicanwho is running for re-election this year. ``Nebraska intends to ridinself of this evil which is corrupting our youth and spawningcrime in our streets. ... Drug abuse is a plague threatening everysingle family.''   Other measures the governor will press in the Legislatureinclude suspension of driver's licenses for those convicted of drugoffenses; creation of a separate ``corruption of minors'' felonyfor those selling drugs to those under 18 or hiring them to work ina drug operation; and boosting the punichment for first-timepossession of marijuana, which now carries just a $100 fine, to upto a $500 fine and three months in jail.   Gary Rex, an aide to the governor, indicated the administrationrealized that some of the proposals, if enacted, might bechallenged in court on constitutional grouns.   Responding to questions, he also acknowledged that peopleconvicted of other felonies, including murder, could still attend apublic college, university or technical community college _ butsomeone convicted of a misdemeanor marijuana charge would beexpelled.</TEXT></DOC>
