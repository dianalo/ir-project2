The president and first lady Nancy Reagan were the featuredattraction at a reception at the Bel-Air mansion ofmillionaire-businessman David Murdock.   The affair behind the walls of Murdock's spacious estate wasclosed to reporters. Among the dignitaries seen entering were Sen.Pete Wilson, R-Calif., who is up for re-election this year, andCalifornia's Republican Gov. George Deukmejian.   Before leaving the White House, the president was briefed byColin Powell, his national security adviser, about two U.S. Navywarships being deliberately bumped by two Soviet warships in theBlack Sea.   Sunny skies and warm temperatures greeted Reagan in Los Angeles,in contrast to the fog and cold he left behind in Washington.   More than 50 couples paid $10,000 each to sip champagne and havetheir picture taken with Reagan and his wife Nancy during their45-minute appearance.   The fund-raiser was Reagan's only scheduled event in California.On Saturday, he will fly to a Pacific resort of Mazatlan, Mexico,for afternoon talks with President Miguel de la Madrid, then travelto his mountaintop ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif., for afour-night stay.   Reagan's political director, Frank Donatelli, said that withless than three weeks' notice, there was no trouble lining upbig-money contributors eager to mix with the president, who waswounded by the Iran-Contra affair and has only 11 months left inoffice.   ``The president will always be able to be a good fund-raiser,''Donatelli said.   The money will go to the California Republican Party. Reaganwill hold another fund-raiser later this year to help there-election campaign of Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., Donatelli said.   He said California is ``one of our top targets this year.'' Withits late primary, the state could play a decisive role in theRepublican presidential race. With 47 electoral votes at stake, themost of any state, it will be a major battlefield for the Novemberelection.   ``A strong, well-financed Republican Party will be a benefit towhoever the nominee is,'' Donatelli said.   Reagan, at a gathering of Republican conservatives Thursdaynight, pledged to ``campaign vigorously for whoever our nomineeis.''   Reporters were excluded from the fund-raiser at the home ofMurdock, who lives on the estate once owned by the late hotelmagnate Conrad Hilton.   A real estate tycoon, Murdock also is chairman of the LosAngeles-based Castle andamp; Cooke Inc., which has revenues of more than$1 billion and is best known for its subsidiary, Dole Food Co., thepineapple and banana distributor.   On Saturday, Reagan will meet with de la Madrid in Mazatlan, aresort area troubled by drug-related violence.   A senior administration official who briefed reporters inadvance of the Reagan-de la Madrid meeting said both Mexico and theUnited States are critical of the other's handling of the drugproblem.   ``The Mexican perception is that we are the world's largestmarket for drugs _ cocaine, marijuana and heroin _ and that we arenot doing enough to reduce the consumption of dangerous drugs inthe United States,'' said the official, who spoke on condition henot be identified.   At the same time, he said, the administration believes Mexico ismaking increasing, but still inadequate, efforts to fight drugtrafficking. ``The flow of drugs is increasing ... and, in ourview, the amount of the drug-related corruption is growing,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
