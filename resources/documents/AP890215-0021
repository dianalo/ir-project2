Here is a summary of new details inthe document, which was released Tuesday:</TEXT><HEAD>FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORP.</HEAD><TEXT>   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., with responsibility for bothbank and Sandamp;L deposits, would get broad new power to countermandregulatory decisions by the primary regulator of Sandamp;Ls, the FederalHome Loan Bank Board, which would become part of the TreasuryDepartment.   Regulators would restrict interest rates offered by insolventinstitutions, limit the institutions' growth and their ability toobtain high-cost deposits from money brokers.</TEXT><HEAD>CAPITAL RULES</HEAD><TEXT>   The FDIC would get the power to put an institution intoreceivership if its capital falls below what the FDIC determines isa safe level, even if it is still solvent.   Currently, an institution can't be closed until all of itscapital is exhausted. Advocates of ``early closure'' say it wouldsave money for government insurance funds.   Sandamp;L owners by June 1991 are being required to come up with moneyto raise capital levels from the required 3 percent to the 6 percentlevel now in force for commercial banks. In the meantime, regulatorswould be required to restrict the growth of any institution thatdoesn't meet the capital requirements.   As a way of bringing new capital into the industry, bank holdingcompanies would be allowed to buy healthy Sandamp;Ls after two years.</TEXT><HEAD>DEPOSIT INSURANCE</HEAD><TEXT>   The Bush plan calls for raising bank insurance premiums from 8.3cents per $100 to 15 cents and Sandamp;L premiums from 20.8 cents to 23cents. But, in extraordinary circumstances, insurance fundadministrators could increase the premium by 50 percent a year up toa maximum of 75 cents. Currently, Congress must approve any increase.   The insurance fund would also be allowed to raise the insurancepremiums for individual institutions as their capital fell closer tofailure levels.   The Treasury Department would have 18 months to finish a study onreducing the scope of deposit insurance.</TEXT><HEAD>CREDIT UNIONS</HEAD><TEXT>   Accounting rule changes would have the effect of requiring thenation's 14,000 credit unions to come up with about $1.5 billionover eight years to strengthen the National Credit Union ShareInsurance Fund. The rules would also make it costly for a federallyinsured credit union to pull out and enter a private insurance plan.</TEXT><HEAD>SAVINGS AND LOAN RESCUES</HEAD><TEXT>   Officials of the restructured regulatory system would be directedto review last year's rescue of 205 Sandamp;Ls with the goal of reducingthe government's costs. The government can't undo the deals, but itcould exercise contract rights reducing the ultimate cost ofassistance to the new owners of rescued Sandamp;Ls.   In the future, regulators would have to take tax losses to thegovernment into consideration before deciding on the best rescuemethod. Regulators' ability to use promissory notes and lossguarantees would be restricted.   The Federal Asset Disposition Association, a much-criticizedquasi-government agency created to manage and sell off assets fromfailed Sandamp;Ls, would be abolished within six months.</TEXT><HEAD>Sandamp;L CONVERSIONS</HEAD><TEXT>   Currently, Sandamp;Ls are prohibited from converting into banks untilAugust. The Bush plan would extend that for five years. After that,Sandamp;Ls could convert by paying an exit fee to the Sandamp;L insurance fundand an entrance fee to the bank fund. Large healthy Sandamp;Ls looking tobecome banks much sooner than five years likely will fight thisprovision.</TEXT><HEAD>MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</HEAD><TEXT>   Banks and Sandamp;Ls would have to bail out sister institutions ownedby the same holding company.   Regulators would be allowed to offer whistleblowers a reward forreporting bank fraud and give regulators the power to require thatfired informants be reinstated and given back pay.   The administration leaves open the question of whether banks andSandamp;Ls would carry the same insurance logo on their doors. Banks wantthe logos to clearly differentiate between banks and Sandamp;Ls. Sandamp;Ls saythe logo should be the same since deposits in both kinds ofinstitutions are federally insured.</TEXT></DOC>
