Silvio Santos, a conservative, declared himself a candidate forthe Nov. 15 election on the ticket of the small BrazilianMunicipalist Party. He is a former street vendor who has strongsupport among the poor, even though he is now a millionairebusinessman.   A poll by the Gallup Institute, which was published Thursday bythe newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo, gave Santos 29 percent of thevote, a wide lead.   The newspaper said support for center-right candidate FernandoCollor de Mello, who had led the polls for six months, had plungedfrom 29.3 percent to 18.6 percent among those questioned.   The nationwide poll was conducted between Oct. 26 and Wednesday,with people interviewed at random in the street and their homes.The margin of error was 3 percent.   Some 82 million Brazilians are to choose a successor toPresident Jose Sarney for a five-year term, the first popular votefor president since 1960. If no candidate wins a majority Nov. 15,the two top vote-getters will face each other in a runoff inDecember.   Santos' entrance into the race was criticized by left- andright-wing candidates, who agreed Sarney was behind the maneuver.Sarney by law cannot run for re-election.   Santos' candidacy still faces legal challenges before it can beregistered with the Supreme Electoral Court.   Accusations have been made that Santos, a TV entertainer whoowns more than 30 businesses, paid off former Municipalist Partycandidate Armando Correa to resign.   The court must also decide if Santos violated a law thatrequires corporate directors to step down from their positionsthree months before declaring their candidacy.   Santos, who runs the SBT television network, the nation's secondlargest, says he is a shareholder and not a director in thecompany, and thus exempt from the law.   Collor de Mello, whose base of support is with the rural poor,was hardest hit by Santos' candidacy, but other major candidatessaw their support fall as well, according to the poll.   Rep. Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, of the socialist Workers' Party,came in third with the support of 10.6 percent of those questioned,down from 12.4 percent in the last poll.   Left-wing populist Leonel Brizola, a former governor, wasfourth, receiving 9.9 percent, a drop of 2.8 percent.   Mario Covas, of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, was fifthwith 8 percent support, down slightly from 8.2 percent in lastweek's poll.   Eight percent of those questioned were unsure who they wouldvote for, and 5.6 percent said they would cast blank ballots.   Gallup conducted a simultaneous poll that excluded Santos fromthe presidential contenders.   Without Santos in the race, 27.5 percent of those questionedfavored Collor de Mello, followed by da Silva at 13.8 percent,Brizola with 12.7 percent and Covas at 10.6 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
