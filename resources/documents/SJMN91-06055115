The law will take effect should theSupreme Court overturn Roe vs. Wade, and it likely will serve as a model forother states wishing to hedge their bets concerning Roe.;    But the Marylandlaw exceeds Roe and, in the words of Edward Grant, an attorney for AmericansUnited for Life, it would have been more accurate to characterize the measureas &quot;The Abortion Industry Protection Act of 1991.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MARYLAND GAINS DUBIOUS DISTINCTION  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Points of ViewCal Thomas is a syndicated columnist.  </MEMO><TEXT>     In Roe, states are allowed to regulate abortions after the baby achieves&quot;viability,&quot; which the Supreme Court arbitrarily set at between 23 and 24weeks' gestation. To live apart from its mother, a baby at this age requiressome kind of life support until it is mature enough to survive on its own.;   But the Maryland law allows physicians to perform abortions without stateinterference until the child is old enough to sustain itself outside themother without artificial support. This means legal abortion may be obtainedup to between 30 and 35 weeks of pregnancy.;    In fact, any doctor inMaryland, invoking the bill's clause on protecting &quot;a woman's health,&quot; couldtheoretically perform an abortion, even for gender selection, up to the momentof birth.;    The strength of the pro-abortion lobby in ramming through thislegislation was evident when a competing bill was quickly defeated. That billwould have merely required a woman to be informed of the availability ofpublic and private support for carrying her child to term and assistance inraising and supporting the child or, if she chooses, placing the baby foradoption. Apparently, choices are to be made in an information vacuum which,by definition, denies women any real choice at all.;    Undertruth-in-labeling laws people must be told of the contents of a can, bottle orbox. They must be informed under truth-in-lending laws when they apply for abank loan. But in Maryland women are to be kept ignorant of any choice otherthan abortion.;    Worse, the new Maryland law gives legal protection toabortionists that is denied physicians who perform any other type of surgery.In addition to removing informed consent requirements, the law provideslimited civil and criminal immunity for a doctor's decision to perform anabortion. If a woman undergoes a &quot;botched abortion&quot; by an incompetent doctorin Maryland, the doctor will have some protections against lawsuits that arenot afforded others in the medical profession.;    No other physicians -- notinternists, not neurologists, not obstetricians, not general surgeons -- areafforded this type of legal immunity. All of these can be sued for improperdecisions to perform surgery -- but not abortionists.;    The Maryland lawdoes more than put unborn babies at greater risk. It puts women at risk ofincompetent abortionists whose primary interest in pushing for this law was toinsure an uninterrupted cash flow.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Cal Thomas column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910224  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  508  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday February 24, 199100055115,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
