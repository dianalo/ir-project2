McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush could grant the Soviet Union``most-favored nation'' trading status at the July economic summitin Houston if the Soviets enact legislation permitting freeemigration, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said Monday.   Bush announced at his Malta summit meeting with Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev last December the United States would beginnegotiating a trade agreement with the Soviets wiping away nearlyhalf a century of trade friction.   The package would include granting most-favored nation tradingstatus, qualifying the Soviet Union for the lowest tariffsavailable to American trading partners. Soviet exports into theUnited States currently bear duties as much as 10 times higher thanimports from other nations.   However, Bush first must waive the Jackson-Vanik Amendmentbarring such status, which Congress passed in 1974 because ofSoviet refusal to allow free emigration. A waiver would requireBush to certify to Congress that free emigration was being allowed.   In a speech to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith,Mosbacher said Soviet enactment and implementation offree-emigration legislation is expected this spring.   ``Passage and implementation of such a law would mean that aJackson-Vanik waiver could be signed sometime this summer _ inJuly, in Houston, Texas,'' Mosbacher said.   Bush and other leaders of the Group of Seven plan to hold theirnext economic summit July 9-11 in Houston. Other members areBritain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany.   The economic meeting will follow the next summit meeting betweenBush and Gorbachev, probably in Washington during the last twoweeks in June. The exact dates have not been announced.   U.S.-Soviet negotiators hope to reach agreement on the overalltrade package in time for the Bush-Gorbachev summit. The firstround of talks were held last month and both sides expressedsatisfaction with their progress. A second round was held later inFebruary in London and a third round is scheduled this month inVienna.</TEXT></DOC>
