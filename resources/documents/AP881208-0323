Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission sayfounder Joseph M. Katz, 75, who retired as chairman in 1983, and hisson, Marshall P. Katz, 48, the current chairman, will be paid $1.5million to terminate their employment contracts two years early.   The two will resign from the board of directors after selling135,000 of their 300,000 shares of Papercraft stock to Robert B.Goergen, a turnaround specialist who succeeded Marshall Katz aschief executive in August, The Pittsburgh Press reported Thursday.   Their remaining shares will leave them with a 14.3 percent stakein the company.   Goergen Thursday confirmed the report and said he will succeedMarshall Katz as chairman after the stock sale.   The newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying the shakeupreflects dissatisfaction with the company's finances.   ``Earnings have not met the projections made at the time of theLBO,'' Goergen said.   The company has been hurt by a shift in consumer preference fromhard needles to soft needles on artificial Christmas trees. Theleveraged buyout was founded on the incorrect assumption that salesand operating earnings would grow substantially.   The 43-year-old Pittsburgh company told the SEC earlier this yearthat it was not generating enough cash to pay interest on $98million in bonds issued to its shareholders as part of the buyout.The first interest payment is due in 1991.   Goergen said the company will be able to meet a $9.2 millioninterest payment due next year to senior debt to private investors.   ``We have positive cash flow this year and projected positivecash flow for next year,'' he said.   Wall Street analysts say Papercraft is one of 10 troubled LBOs,or companies purchased by management and outside investors usingmostly borrowed money, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday.   Papercraft lost $14.1 million on sales of $179.8 million in 1987.It lost $15 million on sales of $114.8 million in the first ninemonths of this year, compared to a loss of $11.7 million on the samerevenue a year earlier.   The company's most recent financial disclosures list long-termdebt of $215 million.   Papercraft also makes gift wrapping, LePage's tapes andadhesives, Royal Terry bath and kitchen towels and Modern Orthofoot-care products.   Despite being privately owned, Papercraft is covered by SECfiling rules because its bonds are publicly held.</TEXT></DOC>
