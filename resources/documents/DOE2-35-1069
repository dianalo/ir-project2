<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-35-1069 </DOCNO><TEXT>An improved zero-dimensional code has been developed and used for comparisonwith ZT-40M and for parametric studies of the behavior of ZT-H. The codeincludes equations for energy balance for electrons and ions. Particledensity and current are specified quantities. Impurities are treatedusing a coronal non-equilibrium model. Particle leakage and recyclingare included for plasma and impurities. A single particle lifetime isused. The energy confinement times for electrons and ions are specifiedas multiplicative coefficients times the Ohmic energy confinement time.Energy loss by electrons is assumed to dominate. Ohmic heating is enhancedby an anomaly factor, and an ion heating term is included by use of amultiplicative factor times Ohmic heating. A single set of coefficientsis found to simulate a variety of ZT-40M runs with different currentsand wall conditions. Both flat top and ramp current waveforms are studied.The resulting model is applied to predict ZT-H behavior for both 2 MAand 4 MA operation. Parametric analysis was performed to evaluate theeffect to varying I/N from 3 x 10{sup -14} to 6 x 10{sup -14}; of varyingthe recycle time from 5 ms to 1000 ms; and of using two different energyconfinement laws, one involving {beta}{sub {theta}} as a calculated parameter,and one for {beta}{sub {theta}} = 0.10. Low temperatures were obtainedfor short recycle times and low I/N values. Significantly improved performancewas found for the {beta}{sub {theta}} = 0.10 case. 4 figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
