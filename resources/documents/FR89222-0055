The purpose of the proposed testing is to test the survival capacityand assess the spread of a genetically engineered baculovirus with pesticidalcharacteristics under field release conditions over a 3-year period. Thisresearch is being funded through a grant from the EPA Office of Researchand Development Terrestrial Biotechnology and Microbial Ecology Program.The proposed testing involves an <T3>Autographa californica </T3>nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) thathas been genetically engineered to delete the polyhedrin gene. UnalteredAcMNPV has been used in field control trials throughout the United States.AcMNPV's known host range is restricted to the <T3>Lepidoptera </T3>order of insects. The field test is to take placeon 2 acres of the Robbins Vegetable Research Farm, New York State AgriculturalResearch Station, Geneva, New York. The target pest will be <T3>Trichoplusia ni, </T3>cabbage looper, and the crop plant will be cabbage.Following the review of the Boyce Thompson Institute application and anycomments received in response to this notice, EPA will decide whether ornot an Experimental Use Permit is required.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 8, 1989.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Anne E.
