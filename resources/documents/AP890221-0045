The southeast corner has been made to appear as it did whenOswald ate lunch there Nov. 22, 1963, waiting for Kennedy'smotorcade. Visitors may not share Oswald's perch _ which has beensealed off with glass _ but see a view of Elm Street close to it.   ``I got a big lump in my throat when I saw this window,'' saidDanny Veno of Dallas. ``I've waited a long time to see this. A long,long time.''   The 9,000-square-foot exhibit organized by the Dallas CountyHistorical Foundation contains 350 photographs, 30 artifacts, a30-minute audio tour and six films running a total of 40 minutes.   ``Our purpose is not to preserve the memory of that death,''Dallas County Judge Lee F. Jackson said at a dedication ceremony.``It is not in our power to preserve what already lives sopowerfully any more than we could erase or escape this history.   ``The lessons of history found here will be passed, like a torch,to all generations.''   ``About 26 years ago America was wounded,'' said the Rev. G.James Christopher of the St. Mark African Methodist Episcopal ZionChurch. ``But today we stand here whole again.''   Dallas residents often have debated whether there should beofficial recognition of the Kennedy assassination in the city wherehe was killed.   The Sixth Floor, Christopher said, shows Dallas has ``finallyreconciled the pain of the past with the promise of hope for thefuture.''   Although it was packed with people, the museum was very quiet,save for some small talk and a couple of children asking quesions.   Four-year-old Jeremy Livingston looked up at his father, JeromeLivingston, a computer programmer from New York.   ``Why would anyone want to kill a president?'' the boy asked.</TEXT></DOC>
