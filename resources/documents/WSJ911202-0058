In a Nov. 6 letter to manufacturers, David D. Glass,Wal-Mart's chairman and chief executive officer, said thediscount retailer has decided it should deal only with&quot;principals,&quot; or employees of its suppliers. People whorepresent more than one company, like a broker ormanufacturer's representative, won't qualify, he said.Wal-Mart buyers have told some manufacturers andrepresentatives that reps and brokers won't be welcome atWal-Mart's Bentonville, Ark., headquarters beginning today.</LP><TEXT>   Wal-Mart's distaste for sales representatives isn't new;some brokers already have lost some lines they used to sellto the retail chain. But that was comparable to losing &quot;afinger or a toe,&quot; says Jack Springer, executive director of atrade group for general merchandise reps. Now, he says,&quot;they're going for the jugular.&quot;   The installation of an advanced computer system thatallows manufacturers to peek into Wal-Mart's store andwarehouse inventories has given Wal-Mart a new reason for therenewed assault on manufacturers' representatives. In hisletter, Mr. Glass cited the system, along with the need for&quot;improved communication and increased reaction time,&quot; as therationale for eliminating third parties.   Some industry participants see this as an attempt byWal-Mart to eliminate a layer of costs, a logical desire fora retailer that brags about its everyday low prices. Butmanufacturers are forbidden by federal antitrust laws fromoffering discounts in place of commissions or brokerage fees.And some manufacturers aren't overjoyed at the big retailer'sattempt to influence the way they do business.   The brokers and manufacturers' reps stand to lose most.Because Wal-Mart can easily account for half of a rep firm'scommissions, some could be forced out of business. &quot;They arecoercing the manufacturers to fire brokers,&quot; says one largeSouthwestern broker, who says he already has lost one sizableaccount because of the move. Like many independent salesrepresentatives and manufacturers interviewed, he asked notto be identified for fear of angering the nation's largestretailer; Wal-Mart accounts for about 16% of his company'sapproximately $600 million in sales volume.   With so much at stake, some rep firms have decided tofight back by raising money for a public relations campaignto spotlight Wal-Mart's actions. Others are vowing to sue ifWal-Mart forces a manufacturer to cut them off.   A Wal-Mart spokesman declined to comment on the issue.   Other retailers and large buyers, like electronics makersand even health maintenance organizations, have tried fromtime to time to cut out the use of independent salesrepresentatives, who usually sell several manufacturers'products to buyers in a particular region for a commission. Aspokeswoman for Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., for instance, says that&quot;with few exceptions, we deal directly with manufacturers tokeep our costs and selling practices competitive.&quot;   But manufacturers and representatives say Wal-Mart hasbeen most aggressive within the industry in trying toeliminate the independents. In the mid-1980s, for example, itbegan asking manufacturers to send only their executives onsales calls. Some reps and manufacturers insisted the companywanted price cuts from manufacturers equal to the brokers'commissions of 2% to 3% for an account of Wal-Mart's size.   The retailer's new computer system has given it moreleverage in the battle. While Wal-Mart already places many ofits orders directly with factories through computers, itsnewest system lets vendors analyze their own sales, trackinventories at Wal-Mart stores and warehouses and checkinvoices. But Wal-Mart insists that manufacturers keep thedata confidential from its brokers and reps.   Some manufacturers argue that using sales reps is moreeconomical than hiring a direct sales force. &quot;Our entiresales force is a broker sales force,&quot; says one snack-foodmanufacturer, whose Southwestern food broker iselectronically linked to Wal-Mart. The executive says herelies on the broker to sell promotions as well as newproducts to Wal-Mart, to visit stores and resolve problems.With margins thin already, he says his company couldn'treplace the brokers with employees. Besides, he says, &quot;We'rereally not keen on people telling us how to run ourbusiness.&quot; But he says his company hasn't decided how it willrespond to Wal-Mart's request.   Jack Hirsch, president of Video Technology Inc., said themaker of electronic educational toys sends a company officialalong with reps on calls to major accounts, but relies on thereps to handle each account's day-to-day needs, like tellingretailers what is selling well and what isn't. While VideoTechnology gets orders directly from Wal-Mart, store managersalso order through its rep's 800 number.   While he says he hasn't received Mr. Glass's letter, therequest &quot;does present a predicament for any manufacturer,&quot;says Mr. Hirsch, a director of Toy Manufacturers of AmericaInc., a trade association. &quot;Nobody wants to risk not grantinga request from one of the top accounts. On the other hand, wehave obligations to the people who represent us.&quot; Toy makersplan to discuss the issue at a meeting this week.   Wal-Mart has won some converts. Borden Inc., which oncesold almost exclusively through reps, now says its ownemployees sell products like Elmer's glue to Wal-Mart, or anexecutive accompanies brokers on calls. A beauty-aids makersays in recent years it agreed to assign a national managerto handle Wal-Mart's account while its representatives callon all other retail accounts. Because Wal-Mart is large andcomplex, &quot;we feel they need special treatment,&quot; a companyexecutive said, though he insists that the treatment doesn'tinclude preferential pricing.   If the reps do sue, at least one recent case would seem tofavor their position. Earlier this year, Fingerhut Cos., acatalog retailer, agreed to settle a 1988 lawsuit, filed inMinnesota state court, charging Fingerhut with interferingwith contracts between manufacturers and reps by asking themanufacturers to sell directly to it. The lawyer for the tworeps who filed the suit said Fingerhut agreed to pay anundisclosed sum and to send a letter to manufacturerswelcoming their reps back.   A Fingerhut spokeswoman said that terms of the settlementprohibit the company from commenting on it.</TEXT></DOC>
