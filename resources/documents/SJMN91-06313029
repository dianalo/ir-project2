Its uses are obvious,and it won't break your bank account.; PHOTO: BEST-SELLING T-SHIRT: Anythingteal. At last count there were about 25 licensed T-shirts ($16-$27), with moreon the way. Teal is so popular that the Sharks home office, when faced with ashortage of teal, contracted out the job of dying T's the exact shade ofPacific teal they needed. You can identify these special T-shirts by their SanJose Sharks Collection label. Runner-up honors go to black T-shirts, even morepopular in some parts of the country than teal.; PHOTO: MOST COLLECTIBLE: Theofficial program ($6) for the first home game of the first season of the SanJose Sharks. It's Vol. 1, No. 1, and the Sharks thoughtfully printed a fewthousand extra for those who didn't make the game.  </CAPTION><DESCRIPT>  HOCKEY; SAN-JOSE; COLLECTIBLE; SALE  </DESCRIPT><LEADPARA>  IT'S no accident the San Jose Sharks are doing well in merchandise sales.;  &quot;We had some ambitious objectives, and that's why we spent so much time andmoney on design and development of our name, logo, colors and uniforms,&quot; saysMatt Levine, the Sharks' executive vice president for business operations.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TEAM EXCEEDS ITS GOAL IN BECOMING NO. 1 SELLER  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See also related article on page 8C of this section. Additional informationattached to the end of this article.  </MEMO><TEXT>     However, Levine admits they didn't expect to reach the No. 1 spotimmediately. &quot;Our original objective,&quot; he says, &quot;was to be ranked No. 2 to No.4 in sales.&quot;;   Fred Scalera, general manager of the retail licensing divisionof the National Hockey League, has announced that the Sharks account for abigger percentage of NHL merchandise than any other team, but declines to beany more specific. &quot;We don't release percentage figures, just rankings,&quot; hesays, explaining that this is primarily out of deference to teams at thebottom in sales.;   Levine has no such qualms, recently announcing his team isaccounting for 28 percent of the souvenir sales -- a number he says he pickedon the basis of conversations with Scalera. &quot;Fred told me we're No. 1 and our(sales) percentage is in the high 20s, so I translated that into 27-28percent.&quot;;   Since the NHL rang up more than $300 million in retail sales ofmerchandise in the United States and Canada during its fiscal year ending June30, it's a nice chunk of money at either 27 or 28 percent. Unfortunately forthe Sharks, they don't get any more or any less than the other 21 teams.;  Scalera explains that the license holders pay an 8.5 percent royalty fee forthe use of team logos and &quot;we divide the profits 22 equal ways -- everyoneshares in it.&quot;;   The No. 1 seller among the thousands of NHL items is thegame jersey, Scalera says. CCM of Montreal, Canada and Radford, Vt., whichmanufacturers all NHL team jerseys &quot;cannot make Sharks jerseys fast enough tokeep up with the sales,&quot; he says. &quot;Demand is far exceeding production.&quot;;   Anauthentic CCM Sharks game jersey is $156 at the Sharks Store in Vallco FashionPark, Cupertino, while a look-alike replica is $69. Aside from price, theprimary differences between the two is that the game jersey CCM logo on theback shirt tail is embroidered, rather than silk-screened, and it has aninside strap that attaches to the belt to keep an opponent from pulling thejersey up over your head during a fight.; HOT HEADGEAR: Attractive as themany, many caps bearing various official Sharks logos are, they areB-O-R-I-N-G once you've seen the plastic topper in the shape of a shark ($10)made to swim atop your head. It's zany, crazy and something only a frenziedfan or a 6-year-old child would wear. Runner-up honors go to the corduroy capwith a red fin on top and a visor that opens up to resemble a shark's jaw($20) -- but where's the teal?;   FUNNIEST: The Zubaz wrestler pants ($37) inzebra stripes of teal, black and white. They looked odd at the first few gameswhen ushers teamed them with tuxedo jackets, shirts and teal bow ties, andthey look odd most everywhere else. But they are comfortable and were perfectfor Halloween clown costumes.;   THE BEST IS STILL TO COME: Included among theever-expanding offerings of Shark merchandise are a few items expected soon,including children's bib overalls, Christmas stockings and T-shirts andjerseys oriented toward specific team members.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARY GOTTSCHALK, Mercury News Style Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911108  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  766  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, November 8, 199100313029,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
