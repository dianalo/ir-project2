Among those charged was the republic's former Communist leader,Inamzhon Usmankhodzhayev, who a year ago was expelled from thenational party's Central Committee.   Usmankhodzhayev and three other officials had been accused bythe weekly magazine Ogonyok of accepting bribes.   Tass identified 20 officials from the republic's national andregional party organizations and local government who had beencharged.   An investigation ``revealed that they accepted large sums ofmoney from their subordinates and other officials for patronage,promotion at work and assistance in solving economic and otherproblems,'' it said.   One regional party official in the neighboring republic ofKazakhstan also was charged, and several more investigations werecontinuing, Tass said.   An investigation of corruption in Uzbekistan was launchedshortly after the death of Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev in1982.   The probe eventually led to Brezhnev's son-in-law, Yuri D.Churbanov, who was found guilty of corruption in December andsentenced to 12 years in a labor camp.   Two criminal investigators who spearheaded the probe intoUzbekistan corruption, Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov, parlayedtheir crusade into political success. Both won seats in theCongress of People's Deputies parliament this year.   But the two prosecutors themselves are being investigated afterallegations arose that they forced confessions from some suspects,and Ivanov publicly accused national Politburo member Yegor K.Ligachev of accepting bribes.   Ligachev has denied the allegation, and the procurator's officesays it has found no evidence to corroborate it.   Gdlyan and Ivanov have been taken off the Uzbekistan case.</TEXT></DOC>
