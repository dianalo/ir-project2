In preparing the samples ofthe sulfur containing heterocycles, the solutions of the compounds wereapplied onto alumina and silica-alumina catalyst surfaces. These catalystswere used to produce the paramagnetic species required to perform EPRand ENDOR spectroscopies. This raises some questions concerning the natureof the surface chemistry involved in the radical production process.In addition to these projects, coal itself was analyzed to obtain anyuseful information from the spectra. The examination of coal and itsderivatives using EPR and ENDOR had special problems that are discussed.These problems made obtaining useful spectra very difficult. Variationsof the factors that affect the shape and intensity of the signals producedby coal and some liquid derivatives were examined to optimize their spectralfeatures. 11 refs., 8 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
