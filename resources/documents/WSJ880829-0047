The agency in April filed suit in federal court here against Carl N. Karcher, chairman and founder of the Anaheim, Calif., fast-food restaurant chain, and other family members, including Carl Leo Karcher, his son.    The suit charges illegal profits were made on information received from Carl N. Karcher and his brother, Donald F. Karcher, the company's president, about an expected sharp drop in Karcher Enterprises' earnings. The information allegedly hadn't then been made public, but later was announced by the company in an Oct. 23, 1984, release.    The SEC contends that Carl Leo Karcher used insider information to avoid at least $10,500 of losses, selling 50 Karcher Enterprises debentures Oct. 19, 1984. The agency said he is the only one it is asking to be found guilty and fined without a trial, because he is the only defendant named in the suit who admitted to receiving and acting on the earnings information.    Carl Leo Karcher's attorney also filed a summary motion, contending his client should be dismissed from the case, because he didn't intend to violate securities laws when he sold the debentures. </TEXT></DOC>
