North testified today ``I don't knowfor a fact'' that former national security adviser John M.Poindexter tore up a politically embarrassing policy statement thatdepicted the Reagan administration's Iran initiative as a straightarms-for-hostages deal.   North said his memory of the event was colored by the fact thatPoindexter acknowledged in congressional testimony in 1987 that hehad destroyed the presidential document, known as a ``finding,'' onNov. 20, 1986 amid public scrutiny of the administration's armssales to Iran.   The former national security council aide testified at apre-trial hearing where Poindexter's lawyer, Richard Beckler, triedto demonstrate that North was tainted by Poindexter's immunizedtestimony to Congress and therefore should not testify as agovernment witness.   Under a 1972 Supreme Court ruling, the government may make nouse of a defendant's testimony compelled under a limited grant ofimmunity. That includes testimony given by other witnesses who mayhave been influenced by the immunized statements.   The presidential finding ``could have been any sheet of paperbut for the fact that'' Poindexter ``confirmed it'' in hisimmunized congressional testimony, North told Beckler.   ``I don't know for a fact ... that the document destroyed thatmorning was the finding,'' North said later when questioned byIran-Contra prosecutor Michael Bromwich.   North testified at his own trial last April that he watchedPoindexter rip up the document as then-Attorney General Edwin MeeseIII began focusing on a November 1985 CIA-assisted shipment of Hawkanti-aircraft missiles to Iran.   Today, however, North said that he hadn't actually read thedocument at the time Poindexter destroyed it.   The destruction of the finding relates to four of the criminalcharges against Poindexter, who is accused of falsely tellingCongress that he didn't learn of the missile shipment to Iran untilJanuary 1986.   The finding, signed by President Reagan in December 1985, wasdrafted because of the CIA-assisted shipment the previous month.   Poindexter is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 22 on charges ofconspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts ofmaking false statements in the Iran-Contra scandal.   On Tuesday, North said he was unable to remember details ofmeetings with his ex-boss, even though the now-convicted Reaganaide testified about those meetings at his own trial.   ``It's difficult to get answers out of this witness,'' declaredU.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene, who said he would giveprosecutors the ``widest latitude'' in interrogating North.   Questioned for five hours Tuesday by Iran-Contra prosecutor DanWebb, North repeatedly was shown transcripts of the testimony hegave last April in which he referred to contacts with Poindexter.   North refused to say that Poindexter had directed him to givefalse statements when North denied to House Intelligence Committeemembers that he had been assisting the Contras.   ``John Poindexter felt as I did, that (he hoped) the rightquestions'' wouldn't ``come up'' so that false answers wouldn'thave to be given, North said in connection with the Aug. 6, 1986meeting in the White House Situation Room.   North testified at his own trial that he felt like a ``pawn'' ina chess game played by ``giants'' when, after a discussion withPoindexter, he made the statements to the House committee.   But North testified Tuesday that ``no one told me to'' make thefalse statements.   Webb suggested that the ``giants'' North referred to werePresident Reagan, former national security adviser Robert McFarlaneand Poindexter.   ``That is not what I said,'' retorted North. ``In general termsI would say it was the executive and legislative branches ofgovernment'' and included Secretary of State George Shultz, DefenseSecretary Caspar Weinberger and CIA director William Casey.</TEXT></DOC>
