<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-28-0462 </DOCNO><TEXT>A generalized higher order two-dimensional version, ILLICO-HO, of thetwo- and three-dimensional ILLICO nodal code has been implemented ona CRAY X-MP/48. This version accepts the order of the spatial approximationand the order of the method as input variables. Results for the zero-orderflat leakage case (equivalent to a (0,2) higher order method), the zero-orderquadratic leakage approximation (QLA) case, and the higher order (2,2),(2,4), and (4,4) cases, where in (i,j) i is the order of the method usedand j is the order of the spatial approximation, are presented in TableI for the Zion 1 pressurized water reactor (PWR) problem. All the resultsare for assembly-size mesh with modifications for the explicit modelingof the baffle. For the two-dimensional International Atomic Energy AgencyPWR benchmark problem the QLA solution for assembly-size nodes givesa k/sub eff/ of 1.0295848. The maximum relative error on assembly powerdensities for this case is 0.02%. Besides giving extremely accurate powersand essentially exact eigenvalues, the methods presented here providedetailed, accurate, surface flux and surface current shapes needed forassembly flux reconstruction.</TEXT></DOC>
