Separately, Mr. Ghorbanifar wrote in a March 1985 letter that Iran had authorized him to arrange four shipments of weapons valued at $63 million. It isn't known whether the U.S. was involved in those plans, or whether any money was provided to Mr. Ghorbanifar for any purchases. But the letter indicates that he was trying to secure arms for Iran at least five months before the U.S. approved secret arms sales to Tehran.    Moreover, federal investigators say they want to determine whether Mr. Ghorbanifar, who acted as a conduit for Iranian funds used to purchase arms, made kickbacks to senior Iranian officials or siphoned off profits for himself or associates. Such activities would be in violation of federal fraud laws if prosecutors determine that all proceeds from the arms sales belong to the U.S.    In the past, congressional investigators have estimated that the secret arms sales to Iran involved only about $50 million. But the Tower Commission said it had traced Iranian payments of $86.7 million to Mr. Ghorbanifar, although its report indicates that it couldn't determine the purpose of two deposits, totaling $40 million, that hadn't been disclosed previously.    When asked about the federal investigation and the Ghorbanifar letter, the Iranian's attorney, Stuart Pierson, said, &quot;We are not commenting until we fully absorb&quot; the commission's report.    As part of the overall probe of the Iran-Contra scandal, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh and congressional investigators are delving into why White House officials, in carrying out the secret arms sales, relied so heavily on Mr. Ghorbanifar.    Mr. Ghorbanifar, called a liar by various U.S. officials while they were using him as the main intermediary with Iran, was even described to President Reagan by former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane as &quot;a devious character,&quot; according to the report released last week by the presidentially appointed commission.    The report says that former National Security Council consultant Michael Ledeen, who praised Mr. Ghorbanifar as a &quot;wonderful man&quot; during an interview with the Central Intelligence Agency, also told the agency that Iran was overcharged for weapons and that some profits went back to Iran. Mr. Ledeen disclosed that Mr. Ghorbanifar, in the words of a CIA memo, &quot;had used around $200,000 . . . to support (his) political contacts inside Iran.&quot;    The Tower Commission report doesn't elaborate, but law-enforcement officials said that this reference, along with other information, has drawn the attention of Mr. Walsh and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents assigned to his investigation.    In a brief interview, Mr. Ledeen said, &quot;I simply don't recall any money paid to any Iranians&quot; by Mr. Ghorbanifar. Mr. Ledeen also said that he and Israeli officials decided at the earliest phase that &quot;there weren't going to be any commissions paid to anybody&quot; involved in the arms sales to Iran.    Asserting that the Reagan administration's reliance on Mr. Ghorbanifar and other intermediaries &quot;invited kickbacks and payoffs,&quot; the report highlights the doubts that U.S. officials had about the trustworthiness of some middlemen. Lt. Col. Oliver North, the fired National Security Council aide who oversaw the Iran operation, wrote in a December 1985 memo that the arms-for-hostages initiative could turn into &quot;a double cross,&quot; with the hostages remaining in Lebanon, according to the commission report.    A few weeks later, Col. North wrote another memo to his boss, then-National Security Council Adviser John Poindexter, passing on suspicions from Israeli officials that Mr. Ghorbanifar and other intermediaries were involved in &quot;a secret business arrangement&quot; to benefit themselves, without &quot;the knowledge of any of the three respective governments,&quot; referring to the U.S., Israel and Iran.    Of the funds the Iranians funneled through Mr. Ghorbanifar, the Tower Commission said it couldn't trace what he did with $59.7 million, including the two deposits totaling $40 million that were disclosed for the first time. The commission couldn't determine whether Mr. Ghorbanifar returned the money to the Iranian government, or perhaps used it for other arms purchases for Iran.    According to the March 1985 letter obtained by this newspaper, Mr. Ghorbanifar told a London company that he had the backing of the Iranian prime minister in his efforts to complete a $63 million arms purchase for Iran. European news reports last month said that Scotland Yard investigated the matter and arrested two men.    A federal investigator said that it was clear that Iran has been desperate for U.S.-made arms and that Mr. Ghorbanifar was &quot;looking in late 1984 and early 1985 for ways to get arms for Iran.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
