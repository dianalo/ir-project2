The technological products and services concern said the technology consists of producing wire that exhibits the strength of core material. Batteries for automobiles are made of lead plates, but the company said the wire could be used instead.    The wire, which has a metal or glass core, also could be used in backup batteries for computers, telecommunications equipment, hospitals and military and industrial applications.    Tracor said creation of the new unit will take three to six months and it currently is negotiating with battery manufacturers as well as studying financing. </TEXT></DOC>
