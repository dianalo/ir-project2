To Acquire Interests In 3 Gold Companies </HL><SO> </SO><CO> ECO MUSMF T.FMR </CO><IN> TNM </IN><DATELINE> EDMONTON, Alberta  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Echo Bay Mines Ltd. said it agreed to acquire minority stakes in three Canadian gold producing companies for 50 million Canadian dollars ($40.6 million).    Echo Bay, a gold mining company, said it will purchase 26.5 million dollars of common shares and 23.5 million dollars of convertible debt securities in the three companies. If the debt securities aren't converted, they are repayable over five years with interest at the prime rate, it said.    If the debt is converted into additional common stock, Echo Bay said it will hold 6.9 million shares of Muscocho Explorations Ltd., or 21% of the stock outstanding. Echo Bay also will hold 3.7 million shares of Flanagan McAdam Resources Inc., or 23.1% of the stock outstanding, and five million shares of McNellen Resources Inc., or 27.1% of the stock outstanding.    Echo Bay said the conversion features are subject to approval by shareholders of the three companies at meetings planned for July. It said the three companies had total gold production of 13,000 ounces in 1987, with a forecast for 1988 output of 50,000 ounces and for 1989 output of more than 100,000 ounces. Proved and probable reserves of the three companies were 900,000 ounces of gold as of Dec. 31, 1987, Echo Bay said.    As part of the agreement, Echo Bay said it will limit any future purchases in the three companies so that its total holding doesn't exceed 33% of the fully diluted shares in each company. The transaction is expected to be completed by early May, subject to regulatory approval, Echo Bay said. The investment is being financed by a loan from two Canadian banks, Echo Bay said. </TEXT></DOC>
