The concentrationwas approximated to normal, logarithmic normal, gamma, and inverse Gaussiandistributions. The fitness to each distribution was evaluated by themaximum log-likelihood method and probability paper method. The resultsobtained by both methods well agreed. The best fitted distribution offine particle concentration was a normal distribution, that of coarseparticle concentration was an inverse Gaussian distribution, and thatof suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration was a gamma distribution.For any particle size, the best fitted distribution of sulfate concentrationwas an inverse Gaussian distribution. The particle size distributionof 10, 50, and 90 percentile values was a bimodal distribution with avalley in the vicinity of 2 {mu}m. The size distribution of each sulfateconcentration percentile value was a monodal distribution with a peakat 0.65 {mu}m. (6 figs, 2 tabs, 13 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
