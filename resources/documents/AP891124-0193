The Commission said in a statement that takeover bids facedformidable legal obstacles in many member countries, but suchroadblocks could be overcome by new measures and the application ofcurrent EC legislation.   The executive Commission said new measures were needed to``facilitate the restructuring of European industry'' as the 12member states attempt to integrate their economies before the endof 1992.   The commission said it wants, among other things, to strengthenthe voting rights of shareholders and force bidders to outlinetheir plans to target companies and their employees.   The commission wants to propose the regulations by March.   The move followed a British demand for measures to counter an ECproposal that would give the Commission power to block largemergers on antitrust grounds.   Takeover bids are becoming increasingly numerous and areexpected to continue as Europe prepares to meld into one market in1992.   Among the EC nations, West Germany and the Netherlands have thehighest barriers to takeover bids while takeovers are more simplein Britain and in France.</TEXT></DOC>
