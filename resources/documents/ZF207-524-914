A common communications protocol standard wouldhave to be adopted before videoconferencing systems are fullytransparent.andP;  Meanwhile, PictureTel is developing Link-64 and Link64-E.andP;  The software programs, due in July 1990, allowhigh-resolution videoconferencing transmission speeds of between64K-bps and 384K-bps.andP;  Link 2.0 supports the European E1transmission speed of 2.048M-bps.andP;  Prices will range from $5,000to $25,000.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   PictureTel Corp.
