Axial distributions of gamma-ray intensity in an irradiationcanister surrounded by these pencils on the circumference of 60 mm diameterwere measured by a dosimeter consisting of a silicon diode connectedto an electrochemical charge integrator. The relation between these distributionswas investigated. A simple method of calculation assuming a linear sourceis found valid for describing the measured gamma-ray intensity profiles.</TEXT></DOC>
