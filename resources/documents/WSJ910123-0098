A group of eight taxpayers who were ordered to payadditional taxes on a tax-shelter investment challenged theauthority of the special judges. They argued that federal lawdoesn't give the special judges, who are appointed by thechief judge of the Tax Court, the power to handle complex taxcases. They also made a broader argument that theConstitution doesn't authorize appointment of judges by theTax Court.</LP><TEXT>   If the Supreme Court agrees with either argument, thedecision may significantly affect the flow of tax decisionsand force the reassignment of thousands of cases to thealready burdened Tax Court judges.   But the justices may temporarily avoid decision of theissues. The eight taxpayers who appealed to the Supreme Courthad agreed in 1986 to have their trial supervised by aspecial judge after the Tax Court judge assigned to the casebecame ill and retired. In agreeing to hear the case, thejustices raised the question of whether, in agreeing to atrial before a special judge, the taxpayers had waived theirright to object to the judge's authority.   The Tax Court differs significantly from most otherfederal courts. The 19 judges of the Tax Court are appointedby the president and confirmed by the Senate for 15-yearterms. They do not have the protection of Article III of theConstitution, which provides life tenure for federal judges.   For decades, federal law has allowed special judges todecide a range of Tax Court cases, generally involvingamounts of less than $10,000. In 1984, Congress amended thelaw to make clear that special judges could handle moresignificant cases.   The chief judge of the Tax Court currently has designated14 special judges who don't have a fixed tenure. Thesejudges, according to attorneys for the eight taxpayers,handle 42% of the Tax Court's cases. At least 80% of the40,000 cases resolved each year by the Tax Court result insettlements, court officials said.   The cases of the eight taxpayers were among 3,000 filed inthe Tax Court after the Internal Revenue Service disalloweddeductions for losses claimed by taxpayers who invested inFirst Western Government Securities, a tax shelter created in1978.   The eight taxpayers, whose suits became one of severaltest cases, complained to a federal appeals court in NewOrleans that Congress authorized special judges only to makerecommendations in major tax cases, not to make finaldecisions. In their case, they said, the special judge in1987 issued a proposed opinion ruling against them that wasadopted and reissued the same day by the chief judge. Regularjudges must actually decide major tax cases, they said.   In July, the appeals court upheld the Tax Court decision,finding no fault with the procedure followed by the chiefjudge.   In the case before the Supreme Court, the taxpayers arguethat the Constitution limits the power to make appointmentsto the president and, in some cases, to department heads andthe federal courts. The Tax Court, they say, is neither anexecutive department nor a federal court as defined in theConstitution.   The high court agreed to hear the appeal despiteobjections from the Justice Department. The department saidthe legal authority of the special judges is clear and arguedthat the taxpayers shouldn't be allowed to attack theconstitutionality of the system after failing to raise thatissue in the appeals court.   But even if the Supreme Court decides that the taxpayerswaived their right to object in this case, the issue iscertain to arise again in a separate case that is pending ina federal appeals court in New York in which the taxpayersdidn't agree to a hearing before a special judge. (Freytagvs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue)                                                                                                          Hazardous Materials                                                                                                          The justices let stand a federal appeals court ruling thatfederal law pre-empts state efforts to regulate thetransportation of hazardous materials. The appeals court inCincinnati last April struck down regulations adopted in 1988by Ohio, although its rules were virtually identical tofederal regulations. The Ohio regulations were challenged bya CSX Corp. unit and other railroads.   Ohio's appeal was supported by nine other states, but theJustice Department filed a brief arguing that Ohio'sregulations were pre-empted. (Public Utilities Commission ofOhio vs. CSX Corp.)                                                                                                          Offshore Drilling                                                                                                          The high court refused to hear the oil industry'schallenge to a San Luis Obispo, Calif., law that requiresvoter approval for construction of any onshore facilities tosupport offshore oil and gas drilling. Last June, a federalappeals court in San Francisco ruled that the challenge maybe moot because after voters refused to approve an onshoreproject, oil companies moved their base of operation tonearby Santa Barbara County.   Similar laws have been adopted by a number of Californiacities and counties, but the appeals court said it waspremature to consider the industry's challenge to those,since no new drilling leases were being sold in those areas.(Western States Petroleum Association vs. Sonoma County)                                                                                                          Princeton Club                                                                                                          The justices left intact a ruling in July by the NewJersey Supreme Court that Princeton University's lastall-male eating club practiced illegal sex discrimination andshould begin admitting women members.   The high court's refusal to hear an appeal by the TigerInn ended a legal battle that began in 1979 when Sally Frank,then a Princeton student, filed a complaint against severalall-male clubs. Two clubs have since agreed to admit women,but Tiger Inn carried the case to the Supreme Court. Ms.Frank is now a law professor at Drake University in DesMoines, Iowa. (Tiger Inn vs. Frank)                                                                                                          Victims' Rights                                                                                                          The justices dismissed Ohio's appeal of a state courtruling that bars juries that are deciding whether to imposethe death penalty from considering the good character of thevictims or the tragedy to their families. The case was arguedlast week, but the justices gave no reason for dismissing it.   In 1987, the high court ruled, 5-4, that weighing thesefactors may prejudice a jury against the defendant who couldface the death penalty. The court's conservatives have vowedto overturn that ruling, but they failed in one attempt in1989 and again yesterday. (Ohio vs. Huertas)                                                                                                          Florida Inmate                                                                                                          In its first 5-4 vote since Justice David Souter succeededretired Justice William Brennan, the Supreme Court threw outthe death sentence of a Florida murderer. In an opinionwritten by Justice Sandra O'Connor, the court said thatRobert Parker's death sentence for a 1982 murder should bereconsidered by a Florida judge to give proper weight tofactors that mitigate in the defendant's favor.   Justice O'Connor was joined by Justice Souter and also byJustices Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun and John Stevens,the first appearance of a new, moderate voting bloc on thehigh court. Justice Byron White dissented, joined by ChiefJustice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia andAnthony Kennedy. (Parker vs. Dugger)</TEXT></DOC>
