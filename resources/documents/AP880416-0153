Despite his statement of remorse, the 21-year-old Chambersrepeatedly shook his head as if to say ``no'' to his plea andsentencing, and Miss Levin's uncle said afterward the apologycarried little weight.   Chambers stood silently while state Supreme Court Justice HowardE. Bell handed down the sentence, which was agreed to by lawyersfor both sides when Chambers entered the guilty plea to a reducedcharge of manslaughter March 25.   The plea came after the jurors in the highly publicized casereported they were deadlocked on the murder charge in their ninthday of deliberations. Chambers began his sentence the day after theplea was entered.   Miss Levin's partially nude body was found in Central Park earlyin the morning of Aug. 26, 1986, a few hours after they had left afashionable East Side bar together.   Chambers had claimed that the death occurred by accident whenMiss Levin hurt him during ``rough sex.'' By pleading guilty tomanslaughter, Chambers admitted he intended to hurt Miss Levin.   Miss Levin's father, Steven, who had also asked to address thecourt, was not allowed to. But he later released a statement,saying that Chambers' ``outrageous lie'' had defamed ``the memoryof our lovely child.''   Chambers sighed deeply before starting his remarks. Heapologized to his family and friends, as well as Miss Levin's, andthanked more than 150 supporters for letters he said he hasreceived since being jailed on his guilty plea.   ``Jennifer's looking down on us now at this circus arena,looking and wondering why it all happened and I don't know,''Chambers said. ``I never wished any of this to happen. ... I wishto apologize to the family and to her friends for all the troublethey have gone through.''   Miss Levin's father, his wife and his ex-wife left theircourtroom seats and exited without comment on the sentence or theChambers apology. They had approved the plea bargain deal prior toChambers' March 25 guilty plea.   But Miss Levin's uncle did comment, saying Chambers' apology``in no way cancels out what he did, which was to murder my niecein cold blood. To me, it was just something he rehearsed by roteand spit out ... to get away with the least possible sentence.''   In a 2{-page letter he had initially wanted to read in court,Miss Levin's father wrote: ``The outrageous lie conceived byJennifer's killer to rid himself of all responsibility was used byhis attorney to defame the memory of our lovely child. Never leftto mourn our daughter's death in privacy, our lives became themedia event of the year.''   The plea bargain also took care of three burglary chargesagainst Chambers, who received a concurrent five-to-15-yearsentence for a burglary count on Friday.   Also in the courtroom for the sentencing were several Chamberstrial jurors, whose deliberations ended with Chambers' guilty plea.   ``I feel sorry for Robert Chambers in that he cannot come togrips with what he did,'' said juror Cole Wallace, 31, after thesentencing. ``Personally, I thought it (his statement) was somewhatself-serving.''</TEXT></DOC>
