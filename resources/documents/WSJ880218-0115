But output of the nation's factories, mines and utilities continued to climb, growing a modest 0.2% in January after rising a revised 0.4% in December, the Federal Reserve Board said separately. The Fed previously put the December increase at 0.2%.    The January decline in housing starts follows a revised drop of 15.5% in December, when starts were reported at a 1,404,000 annual rate. The Commerce Department said starts of single-family houses fell 2.9% to 1,041,000 and starts of apartment building units were nearly unchanged at the low level of 315,000 units.    Monthly measures of housing construction fluctuate irregularly so the Commerce Department cautions against relying on any one month's numbers. Lyle Gramley, economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, added that the January decline partly reflects worse than usual weather. Both the housing and industrial output figures are adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations.    Still, economists for housing trade associations expect about 1.5 million starts this year, down from 1,620,800 in 1987 and 1,805,400 in 1986.    Putting the best possible interpretation on the January numbers, Martin Regalia, economist for the National Council of Savings Institutions, said, &quot;I don't expect it to get any worse.&quot;    But David Seiders, economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said, &quot;I don't like the looks of this.&quot; Because of changes in the tax laws that hurt developers and because of unusually high vacancy rates, he says he doesn't expect much of an increase in apartment building. Also disturbing, he added, was a 6.9% January decline, to an annual rate of 907,000, in the issuance of building permits for single-family homes. Building permits for housing of all kinds fell 8.2% to an annual rate of 1,250,000.    The Fed said the increase in industrial production reflected a 0.4% rise in production of consumer goods -- particularly light trucks, food and energy -- offset by a 7.5% decline in auto production. Production of business supplies and manufacturing equipment rose. Production of iron and steel fell.    Priscilla Trumbull, an economist at WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said the January measure shows little change from recent reports. &quot;The industrial sector is still expanding, but at a slow rate,&quot; she said.    Here is a summary of the Federal Reserve Board's report on industrial production in January. The figures are seasonally adjusted.                                             % change from                                            Dec.
