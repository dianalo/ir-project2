The increase, however, was much less than the 6 percent to 8percent that some analysts had been predicting and raised prospectsof continued tight U.S. supplies and strong prices.   ``This would be the largest wheat area since the 1985 crop''when plantings totaled 57.8 million acres, said the department'sAgricultural Statistics board.   A major concern is that despite the increase in plantings lastfall, crop conditions have been far from ideal so far this winter.   ``Lack of moisture stressed winter wheat in the central andsouthern Great Plains during December,'' the report said. ``Inmid-to-late December, cold weather stressed winter wheat in thesouthern Great Plains, Delta and Southeast.''   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the followingyear. It accounts for about three-fourths of the total U.S. wheatoutput.   Last year's winter wheat production declined because oflingering drought in some major production areas, but total wheatoutput increased because of a boost in spring-planted areas.   Meanwhile, U.S. wheat stockpiles have continued to shrink, thuskeeping market prices at high levels.   To help replenish dwindling reserves, the department isrequiring farmers to idle only 5 percent of their wheat base acresthis year, compared with a 10 percent set-aside in 1989 and 27.5percent previously.   In another option intended to boost production, wheat farmersare permitted to plant up to 10 percent more acreage than otherwisewould be permitted under the 1990 program.   As originally announced last May 31, farmers were to plant nomore than 95 percent of their wheat land. But the option announcedon Sept. 13 lets them plant up to 105 percent, or 10 percent morethan otherwise would be permitted under the basic program.   Economist John Schnittker, a Washington-based consultant, saidthat larger plantings would have provided a better cushion forpossible yield losses later in the season.   For example, he said, if plantings had been boosted 6 percent to8 percent as many had expected, that would have helped offset anymajor impact from reduced yields caused by poor growing conditions.   But with only a 3 percent increase in 1990 plantings, thatcushion is thinner and ``leaves very little margin for reducedyields,'' Schnittker said in a telephone interview. ``We're atgreater risk than expected.''   The report showed that wheat farmers in Kansas, traditionallythe biggest producer, kept plantings at last year's level _ 12.4million acres. Increases were reported in Missouri and Montana,Oklahoma, South Dakota and Washington.   But Nebraska farmers reduced winter wheat plantings by 2percent, and Texas producers cut theirs by 3 percent.   In a supply-and-demand analysis, officials said the U.S. totalwheat stockpile on June 1, the beginning of the 1990-91 wheatmarketing year, could be reduced to 468 million bushels from 702million last June 1 and 1.26 billion bushels two years ago.   However, the new June 1 forecast was up 25 million bushels fromindications in December. No projections were included for 1990-91.   Export demand has been fed by U.S. price subsidies for a numberof countries, including the Soviet Union and China. Even so, totalwheat exports in 1989-90 are expected to drop to around 1.275billion bushels, down from 1.419 billion last season.   Domestic requirements are slightly more than 1 billion bushelsfor 1989-90, the report said.   The analysis said average market prices may average in the rangeof $3.80 to $3.90 per bushel over the 12-month marketing year, fiveto 10 cents less than the December projection. Wheat pricesaveraged $3.72 in 1988-89 and $2.57 in 1987-88.   Another report showed the Dec. 1 inventory of all U.S. wheat at1.42 billion bushels, down 17 percent from a year earlier. Farmholdings at 582 million bushels, were down 6 percent from Dec. 1,1988, while off-farm stocks at 836 million were down 24 percent.   The Dec. 1 corn stockpile was estimated at 7.08 billion bushels,virtually the same as a year earlier. Farm inventories werereported at 4.7 billion bushels, up 10 percent, while off-farmholdings dropped 15 percent to 2.38 billion bushels.   Soybean stocks were reported at 1.61 billion bushels, up 18percent from a year earlier. Farm inventories, at 793 millionbushels, were up 22 percent, and off-farm stocks rose 14 percent to817 million.   A review of 1989 crop production relatively minor adjustments inUSDA's previously announced harvest figures.   The 1989 wheat crop was reported at 2.04 billion bushels, up 12percent from 1988; corn, 7.53 billion bushels, up 53 percent;sorghum, 618 million bushels, up 7 percent; oats, 371 millionbushels, up 72 percent; barley, 403 million bushels, up 39 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
