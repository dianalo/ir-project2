A federal appeals court here upheld his appointment by Attorney General Edwin Meese, Mr. Walsh's office said. The court also echoed its previous finding that the time isn't yet ripe to consider a constitutional challenge to Mr. Walsh's original appointment by a special court. Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, one of the principal targets of the investigation, has sought to challenge the constitutionality of the court appointment, which was made under the Ethics in Government Act.    Also yesterday, Switzerland's Supreme Court issued a ruling that clears the way for Mr. Walsh to receive Swiss bank records relevant to his investigation of possible criminal violations in the scandal.    The U.S. court ruling upheld a grand jury subpoena obtained by Mr. Walsh, reportedly for Col. North's fingerprints. Paul Friedman, Mr. Walsh's lawyer before the appeals court, said the ruling &quot;lets us proceed with the investigation.&quot;    All three judges on the panel upheld Mr. Walsh's authority under Mr. Meese's appointment, according to the Walsh spokesman. Judge Stephen Williams dissented from the other two judges only in saying that the constitutional challenge to Mr. Walsh's original appointment was ripe, the spokesman said.    In Switzerland, a tribunal of the high-court reaffirmed Mr. Walsh's right to obtain bank records through a Swiss-U.S. treaty on cooperation in criminal investigations.    In Washington, Mr. Walsh said the Swiss federal office for police matters and a Geneva magistrate &quot;have assured us that they will proceed promptly&quot; in transferring the records to him.    The records transfer had been delayed by a court challenge filed by retired U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord and Iranian-born businessmen Albert Hakim and Manucher Ghorbanifar. The three men played leading roles in the secret Iran arms sales, which generated funds that were diverted to the Nicaraguan insurgents known as the Contras.    The bank records are considered essential in any case against principal figures in the Iran-Contra scandal. Mr. Walsh's staff is said to be studying whether federal funds were misspent, and whether fraud, conspiracy or obstruction-of-justice charges are warranted.    Central targets of the investigation include Gen. Secord, Col. North and former National Security Adviser John Poindexter. </TEXT></DOC>
