The legislation fell short of extending full civil rightsprotections to employees of the U.S. Senate itself. But itwill, for the first time, subject the personnel practices ofa chamber of Congress to judicial review.</LP><TEXT>   The bill, which passed 93 to 5, would reverse several 1989Supreme Court decisions that made it harder for individualswho claim they are victims of discrimination to win lawsuits.The most significant of these cases, Wards Cove v. Atonio,shifted the burden of proof away from employers and towardemployees in lawsuits alleging indirect employmentdiscrimination. The new law will return the burden of proofin such lawsuits to employers.   The bill also will allow juries to award punitive damagesto individuals who successfully sue for job-bias related tosex, religion, or disability. The amount of punitive damagesavailable would depend on the size of the company being sued.Currently, only victims of race discrimination may receivepunitive damages.   The bill will apply in part to employees of the Senate andto roughly 2,000 White House employees and high-ranking stateand local government employees. It also will extend to theseindividuals civil rights protections under the Civil RightsAct of 1964, the Age Discrimination Act of 1967, theRehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans WithDisabilities Act of 1990. Unlike employees of privatecompanies, though, these individuals won't be able to havetheir cases heard by juries, and they won't be able toreceive punitive damages.   Presidential appointees confirmed by the Senate willremain entirely exempt from the new bill and the earliercivil rights laws. Most other executive-branch employeesalready are subject to civil rights laws.   The provision to cover the Senate, proposed by Sen.Charles Grassley (R., Iowa), passed on a voice vote. Sen.Warren Rudman (R., N.H.), strongly opposed the concept; hetermed the amendment a violation of the Constitution'sspeech-and-debate clause and the separation-of-powersdoctrine. A separate amendment by Sen. Rudman shiftingpotential financial liability for unfair employment practicesfrom the Treasury to individual senators passed on a voicevote.   Legal scholars appeared divided on the constitutionalissues surrounding Sen. Grassley's amendment. WalterDellinger, a law professor at Duke University, said &quot;it isunderstandable why Congress would not like a vast arsenal ofstatutes that are available to the executive to undercutlegislative independence.&quot;   But Laurence Tribe of the Harvard Law School said it was&quot;simply wrong to see any serious separation-of-powers orspeech-and-debate clause problem&quot; connected to endingcongressional exemptions from civil rights and employmentlaws. He termed yesterday's action &quot;a long overdue step alonga journey that should probably be completed.&quot;   Under the bill, any employee of the Senate could bringcivil rights claims against senators and other Senateofficials to a newly created office of fair employmentpractices. A similar office already is in operation withinthe House.   The Senate majority leader and president pro tem wouldappoint the director of the Senate office, who in turn wouldname officials such as retired judges to hear individualcases. Senators or their employees couldn't serve as hearingofficers. The office would be able to provide workers withsuch relief as back pay, reinstatement, promotion andcompensatory damages.   Decisions by the office subsequently could be reviewed bythe U.S. appeals court. Senate employees still wouldn't beable to have their claims heard before a jury, and wouldn'tbe eligible for punitive damages, though.   Sen. Grassley, who originally pushed for more-completecivil rights coverage for Senate employees, agreed to thecompromise, which was brokered by Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell (D., Maine.). An attempt by Sen. Don Nickles (R.,Okla.) to allow jury trials and punitive damages for thegovernment employees newly covered by the bill was set asideTuesday on a 54-42 vote.   The five senators who voted against the bill were Sen. DanCoats (R., Ind.), Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.), Sen. Bob Smith(R., N.H.), Sen. Steve Symms (R., Idaho), and Sen. MalcolmWallop (R., Wy.). Two senators, Sen. Harris Wofford (D., Pa.)and Sen. Bob Kerrey (D., Neb.) weren't present.</TEXT></DOC>
