(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A malfunctioning fan in aplutonium-processing area caused the evacuation of about 100employees at the Savannah River Plant Monday, but officials saidthere was no contamination of the workers or the atmosphere.   The fan broke down at 2:46 p.m., and was restarted about 30minutes later, said plant spokesman Cliff Webb. The cause of theequipment failure was under investigation.   The exhaust fan is used to pull fresh air from the outsidethrough the building and out to filters that trap any radioactivematerial. The air flow serves to remove any releases ofcontamination from the building.   But a fan failure could produce a reverse air flow, which couldallow contamination to accumulate in the building or be forcedoutside.   The amount of contamination would depend on how much plutoniumwas being processed when such an accident occurred. Officials willnot discuss specifics on plutonium production.   A backup fan normally would have been activated, but the secondunit was out of service for routine maintenance, Webb said.   Meanwhile, about 700 employees elsewhere in F-Area, whereplutonium is refined for use in nuclear weapons, were detainedabout an hour while an inventory of nuclear materials wascompleted. Such inventories are routinely conducted, Webb said.</TEXT></DOC>
