The optimism seemed almost improbable given the rocky start ofVioleta Barrios de Chamorro's conservative administration and thedire straits of this battered nation.   The 60-year-old widow took office Wednesday, confronting deepdivisions in her United National Opposition coalition and thousandsof Contra rebels who refused to lay down their arms.   Government ministries and agencies were in disarray, some barelyfunctioning and most under only nominal control of her coalition,known as UNO. No one in UNO would say whether the outgoingSandinistas had left enough money in the treasury to meet Monday'sstate payroll.   In addition, the value of the national currency was slashed inhalf Friday and the prices of staples such as rice, meat and oilsoared.   But Nicaraguans voted for change _ for peace and a measure ofprosperity _ when they voted against the leftist Sandinistas in theFeb. 25 elections and their expectations were not so quickly dashed.   In the bustling Eastern Market, a bastion of free-enterprisespirit, merchants shrugged off the latest plunge in the cordoba asa necessary evil.   ``They had to do something to stabilize things,'' said appliancesalesman Carlos Brinones. ``The value was unrealistic. If they canjust keep it stable for six months....''   The cordoba has ridden a roller coaster for years, propelled byinflation that hit a staggering 36,000 percent in 1988.   ``Business is business,'' Candida Salgado, a Sandinista, saidfrom the shade of her clothing shop. ``It keeps going somehow; ithas its own magnetic force.''   Mrs. Salgado believes the Sandinistas were good for Nicaraguabecause they freed it from dictatorship. Now she says it is up toMrs. Chamorro to repair the damage inflicted by war with theU.S.-backed Contras and years of U.S. economic sanctions.   From market to mansions, Nicaraguans expect the new governmentto reap millions in foreign aid and trade.   ``Dona Violeta could open a new path, she could take us anotherstep forward,'' Mrs. Salgado said as she sat chatting with hersister from Miami.   Nellie Campos, 52, ventured back for a visit after 10 years ofexile because of Mrs. Chamorro's election. She is thinking ofstaying for good.   ``Business is always business,'' she said, echoing her sister.``There are always possibilities.''   For Mrs. Campos, the decision to return hinges on whether shecan reclaim her shop and house. They were taken over under a ``lawof absence'' that discouraged Sandinista critics from returningfrom abroad.   The property of thousands of others was confiscated outright.For them, Mrs. Chamorro's election means a shot at recuperatingsome of their losses.   Mariano Valle, for example, lost 11 radio stations. He and otherpre-revolutionary broadcasters expect the new government to followthrough on its promise to review the confiscations.   The confiscated stations became part of a government-run networkwhich the Sandinistas handed over to party faithful after losingthe election.   ``It was supposedly `privatization,''' Valle scoffed during aninterview at his elegant home.   The dismantling of the radio network was part of a post-electionrush aimed at ensuring that Sandinista loyalists wouldn't leavepower empty-handed.   Thousands got homes occupied under the ``law of absence'' orconfiscated by the government. Car dealers say their inventorieswere cleaned out for Sandinista ``going away'' gifts at governmentexpense.   ``We have sold 60 cars since the election,'' said IdaliaGonzalez, a saleswoman at the Hyundai dealership. ``We normallysell six a month.''   The greedy scramble sparked a land rush among the left-out poor,who have been squatting on vacant lots since the election.   Expectations are basic in the ruined economy.   ``We hope the new government will help us get buildingmaterials,'' Rosalina Garcia Calero, 52, said as fellow squattersat the dump burned trash and marked off 30-foot-by-45-foot plotswith rocks, bits of debris and crooked sticks. ``The old one neverdid.''   Mrs. Garcia was one of more than 150 home-hungry people who haveoccupied the dump in the past few days.   ``Things aren't going to change overnight,'' said 45-year-oldDamian Gutierrez, who lives in one room with 14 relatives and seesthe dump land as his only hope for a home of his own. ``But theywill change.''</TEXT></DOC>
