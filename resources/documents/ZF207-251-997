Hanley, IRM director at the Environmental ProtectionAgency, said, &quot;I think the emphasis on formal planning is over-done.andP;  We doneed to plan but we need to have a vision.andM;&quot;Forced planning doesn't make people good planners.andP;  It's how to getthoughtful plans that meet the mission,&quot; Hanley said.andP;  &quot;Some formal,structured approaches don't work well enough to justify costs.&quot;andM;Planning was the cornerstone of many of the president's REform '88initiatives designed to upgrade federal financial management systems toprivate-sector levels by 1988.andP;  The plan called for governmentwideimplementation of a standard general ledger to support all routine budget andfinancial reports and to create a consolidated financial management systemoperating in all major agencies.andM;The program also sought to cut the number of different payroll and personnelsystems in use from 69 to 28 by 1988 and to 12 by 1992.andP;  That goal provedambitious; the number of different systems stood at 56 at year's end.andM;Date Extended to 1992andM;The administration aimed at first to complete all the pieces of Reform '88during Reagan's term, but slow progress forced an extension of the completiondate to 1992.andM;Reform '88 also emphasized the use of off-the-shelf financial software orcross-servicing arrangements and correction of deficiencies in financialsystems.andM;To help agencies move to common systems, the Joint Financial ManagementImprovement Program (JFMIP), an inter-agency group, issued core functionalstandards for off-the-shelf financial management software.andP;  In October theGeneral Services Administration awarded two schedule contracts for softwareproducts complying with the standards.andM;&quot;We don't have everything wrapped up with a bow yet.andP;  We have to get thefinancial systems in place and working,&quot; said Jimmie Brown, chief of OMBsFinancial Systems Policy Branch.andP;  &quot;What we have are payroll, property,procurement and administrative systems, and a lot needs to be done tointegrate that kind of information.&quot;andM;OMB officials said they were satisfied with the financial systems improvementstrategy.andP;  The next step, they said, will be to use the systems as managementtools rather than just for tallying and reconciling accounts.andM;&quot;We're getting good, fundamental systems that have data compabitibilitygovernmentwide.andP;  We're getting good, solid things in place, and then [theycan] evolve to programmatic and performance information,&quot; Brown said.andP;  &quot;Wewant to go from a solid information base to a solid information system.andP;  Wewant to evolve into more management systems than pure accounting systems.&quot;andM;Brown said OMB will continue to push the systems integration process throughmore JFMIP standards projects.andP;  He said OMB plans further payroll andpersonnel standards and will tackle the next level of the standard generalledger to help standardize all financial information required by OMB andTreasury.andM;Financial Plans ReviewedandM;In addition, Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS) will continue itsoversight duties to ensure compliance with financial standards and helpagencies develop plans.andP;  Agencies must submit their financial managementplans to OMB, and the administration has linked those plans to the budgetprocess.andM;It is too early to know whether that practice will continue in the Bushadministration, but Susan Lee, director of the agency financial systemsprogram at FMS, said her service will continue to work with agencies onplanning, developing systems evaluation tools and serving as a clearinghouseon projects such as users groups.andM;&quot;we have a basic review role.andP;  We are responsible for the reports that comeout,&quot; Lee said.andP;  &quot;We're starting to develop criteria for evaluating systems.andO;We have a database on the different kinds of financial systems and projects.&quot;andM;Lee said FMS will hold a conference on financial systems in May and plans togive awards for systems improvements and development to make agencies awareof good systems available and to encourage information sharing.andP;  &quot;We'll beworking with the users for agencies and with some vendors because we want toserve as a source of information for others looking for off-the-shelfproducts,&quot; she said.andM;While financial systems reforms appear to have been institutionalized, IRMprocurement issues remain controversial.andP;  The Reagan administration tried torevamp procurement, but not all the measures made it through Congress.andM;The president's last management report listed 22 bills on the White Housewish list, including proposals to consolidate and simplify civilian anddefense acquisition regulations and to reauthorize permanently the Office ofFederal Procurement Policy.andP;  OFPP was reauthorized this year, but in light ofthe recent Defense Department procurement scandal, Congress is not likely tolook for ways to reduce regulations and oversight, officials said.andM;Yet the persistence of delays and hurdles in the procurement system has leftsome IRM officials frustrated.andP;  Despite projects such as GSA's Go For 12demonstrations, Hanley said, the government needs to adjust its view of theprocess.andP;  He said reform efforts to date have been laudable, but most havefailed to deal with the cause of delays or offer viable alternatives.andM;Same Decisions, Higher CostsandM;&quot;It's not working.andP;  we're not getting better decisions, we're not gettingfairer treatment of vendors, and we're not getting the kinds of technologyand support services we need on a time and cost basis.&quot;andP;  Hanley said.andM;&quot;Maybe it's time to step back and say there's no such thing as a 100 percentguarantee and it's smarter to deal with that reality.andP;  The whole system isbased on second-guessing decision-makers at every point.andP;  Somebody has tomake a decision, yet we keep adding on ways&quot; to override a decision, he said.andO;&quot;We're not getting better decisions, just paying more for them.&quot;andM;After eight years of concentrating on acquiring technology, it appears thenext challenge for government will be to use the information better.andM;Franklin S. Reeder, chief of OMB's Information Policy Branch, said theemphasis will be on efficiency and using information systems asdecision-making tools.andP;  Reeder predicted many of the changes will begenerated by aggressive users looking to push the techology to its limits.andM;&quot;We'll not simply have devices seen as back room devices.andP;  It meanselectronic data interchange, Touch-Tone interaction and greater use ofcomputers as decision-support tools rather than simply as calculators andtypewriters,&quot; Reeder said.andM;&quot;You'll see an explosion of technology.andP;  The changes come by controlledexperimentation, not a deliberate top-down process.&quot;andM;Haney agreed, saying, &quot;Information needs and requirements need to drive thetechnology, not the other way around.andP;  We're in the process of doing theflip-flop.&quot;andM;&quot;The biggest challenge is putting it all together to impact networks, tie inwith local area networks and end-user computing,&quot; Phillips said.andP;  &quot;It's anarchitecture problem.andP;  .  .  .  We [IRM officials] need to be like anorchestra conductor to bring it all about.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
