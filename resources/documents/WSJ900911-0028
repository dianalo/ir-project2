Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, WilliamSeidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., expressedsome doubt about whether it is prudent to maintain the policyof automatically seizing sick Sandamp;Ls. &quot;Closing an institutionrapidly does not necessarily mean that we'll end up withoutloss,&quot; Mr. Seidman said. &quot;If the institution is not beingbadly managed, we simply transfer bad assets from theinstitution to the government.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The government already has seized most of the biggest andmost insolvent thrifts, leaving the RTC bloated with billionsof dollars in assets. The assets remain a taxpayer burdenuntil the agency finds buyers -- a process that is expectedto take years. The RTC now must evaluate whether thistourniquet approach makes sense for thrifts not bleeding redink so profusely.   But by allowing undercapitalized Sandamp;Ls to remain open, theregulators risk repeating mistakes of the 1980s, whenregulators allowed ailing thrifts to continue operating inthe hope that the economy would improve. The strategy, called&quot;forbearance,&quot; simply gave the thrifts more time to pile uplosses.   &quot;With the history during the 1980s, any notion offorbearance tends to be automatically seen as unattractiveand not facing up to problems,&quot; Sen. Donald Riegle, chairmanof the committee warned. But the Michigan Democrat urged theregulators to reverse course if new tactics can save money inthe long run.   Many industry experts have complained that the RTC hastaken an unyielding approach toward undercapitalized thrifts,whose management and portfolios may differ radically. &quot;TheRTC is already choking on everything it has,&quot; said RandyGerman, a thrift accounting expert for Grant Thornton, a NewYork-based accounting firm. &quot;They are going to have to comeup with other ideas.&quot; He said the regulators should delayseizing sick thrifts, while monitoring their operations.   With the bailout fund expected to run out of cash by theend of the year, a strategy of easing up on undercapitalizedthrifts would allow cleanup officials to conserve cash in theshort term. And even after Congress sets aside new funds forthe cleanup, soft real-estate markets are going to push theSandamp;L cleanup costs still higher, Mr. Seidman said. &quot;Every timewe estimate losses now, we're looking at lower real-estatemarkets, which means the losses are higher,&quot; he added.   Also at the hearing, the banking regulators agreed toresolve within 30 days a dispute over the amount of capitalthat banks must hold in reserve. New regulations requirebanks and thrifts to reserve capital based upon the amount ofrisk in their lending. Mr. Seidman, also chairman of theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp., said that the FDIC agreeswith rules proposed by the Federal Reserve governing minimumcapital standards. The two agencies are discussingdifferences in the capital rule language with the comptrollerof the currency.</TEXT></DOC>
