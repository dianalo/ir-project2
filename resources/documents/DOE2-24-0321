Gravitational interactions produce enormous tides in the diskof spiral galaxies, generate spiral arms and trigger bursts of star formation.Around elliptical galaxies, the collision with a small companion producesa series of waves, or shells. A galaxy interaction leads, in most cases,to the coalescence of the two colliders: second generation galaxies aretherefore still forming now by galaxy mergers, essentially ellipticalgalaxies, but also compact dwarfs. Collisions between galaxies couldalso trigger activity in nuclei for radiogalaxies and quasars.</TEXT></DOC>
