Various states' rate-rollback orders cause some firms todelay writing new policies until their rate disputes aresettled. &quot;Insurance is still available, but at a very highcost,&quot; says consumer activist Virginia Knauer. SomePennsylvania carriers write new policies only for kin ofexisting clients. Assigned-risk plans, with rates 65% higherthan average, take up the slack. Assignments to California'srisk pool, where rates are actually low, rose 58% in 1989.But drivers there who aren't &quot;white, upper middle-class&quot; findcoverage hard to get, says consumer activist HarveyRosenfield.</LP><TEXT>   Some consumers are benefiting, though. Pennsylvanians &quot;whocouldn't afford insurance before are buying it now,&quot; saysPhiladelphia insurance agent Robert Stevenson. But the roadahead may get bumpy, if carriers exit markets where they saypremiums don't cover costs. New Jersey steps up pressure toblock an ITT Corp. unit from withdrawing; State Farm stopswriting new policies there. &quot;It's going to get a lot worse,&quot;Mr. Stevenson says. A South Carolina agent loses threecarriers in a month.   Former insurance regulators in New Jersey set up areciprocal exchange, where drivers indemnify each other.                                                                                                          YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE JEWISH to buy kosher, food firmsdiscover.   Health-conscious folk see &quot;benefits in the quality controland lack of additives&quot; in kosher foods, says Stephen F. Hall,a consultant. Sales of the products, which are made accordingto Jewish dietary law, approach $1.5 billion: growth is putat about 10% a year. Coors is the first U.S. beer certifiedkosher, although there's nothing inherently un-kosher aboutbeer. Thompson Medical's Slim-Fast diet aids also go kosher.Most of the $1.7 billion of foods CPC Internationaldistributes are certified kosher.   Kosher Club Inc. ships strictly kosher meals overnight;firms &quot;panic&quot; when they learn they will be entertaining anOrthodox Jewish client, says Stephen Ostrow, president. RabbiYosef Wikler says kosher certification groups doubled to 97world-wide in the past five years. Rep. Solarz (D., N.Y.)introduces a bill to ensure kosher products are certified,citing potential for abuse.                                                                                                          CREDIT-CARD BUYER protection plans grow popular, butlimits start appearing.   Firms lure customers by insuring card-purchased itemsagainst loss, damage or theft. Citibank's Visa and MasterCardcustomers consider the plans &quot;one of the most importantservices&quot; the cards provide, says Richard Srednicki, businessmanager. American Express gets 300,000 claims totaling $45million since the plan started in 1987. Some banks extend theplans to cover checking accounts and ATM cards. Among thestranger claims: A shower stall lost on a highway and acamera broken in a safari brawl with chimpanzees.   But costs to issuers can be substantial: Citibank spends$20 million a year for the service, estimates Spencer Nilson,who publishes an industry newsletter. &quot;The number of claimsis alarming,&quot; he says, and fraud is increasing. As of Oct. 1,American Express holders will leave home with lessprotection: A claim will be limited to $1,000, from $50,000.Items stolen from cars also will be excluded. Consumer groupBankcard Holders of America warns of such restrictions.   Making a claim isn't easy. Serial numbers are required.&quot;It sounds good but it's a hassle,&quot; Mr. Nilson says.                                                                                                          DATA ON THE FLY: New York Telephone puts computerinformation services at Kennedy Airport, and plans tests atLa Guardia. Services range from stock prices to planereservations. Cost is 25 cents to access. Other charges,billed via calling card, vary. Nynex explores use of creditcards.                                                                                                          DIAPER DILEMMA? IGI Inc. patents a diaper it says uses abiodegradable material with enzymes that speed breakdown evenin landfill conditions. But environmentalists are dubious,and still lean toward reusable cotton diapers.                                                                                                          ANIMAL FARM Petting Zoo in Manorville, N.Y., takes inalligators, cattle, horses, parrots, rabbits, dogs and cats.They come in for a fee, go out for a donation.                                                                                                          CAMPUS HEADHUNTERS arrive as turnover of topadministrators rises.   Fund-raising duties increase pressure, shorten tenure forpresidents. That boosts demand for recruiters to fill posts.Among the hunted: new presidents at Johns Hopkins, OhioState. Heidrick andamp; Struggles Inc. has 5,000 prospects; it ran60 academic searches last year. Recruiters don't substitutefor internal search panels. But they generate &quot;short lists,&quot;and help with advertising, paper work and background checks.Fees run one-third of first-year salaries, which can top$200,000.   Firms vie for prestige jobs, but Harvard won't say whetherit will use one in its presidential search. Brandeis will,choosing from eight firms. Although no one wants to be seenas a &quot;jumper,&quot; deans or provosts who stay put more than fiveyears are &quot;fair game&quot; for recruiters, says John D. Phillipsof Korn/Ferry International. Gaining ground on the wish listsfor presidents: academic stature and public relations savvy.   Headhunting for professors may rise as academicspecialties narrow and Ph.D. pools shrink.
