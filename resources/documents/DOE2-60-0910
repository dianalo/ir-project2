Resources such as these interact on aregional scale, and realistic projections of the effects on these resourcesmust take into account the important interactions and feedbacks linkingthem. In addition, carbon dioxide directly affects the water use andgrowth of vegetation; therefore, the interactive effects of carbon dioxideand climate must also be considered. These interactions and feedbackspose a significant challenge to any attempt to model the response ofresources to changing carbon dioxide and climate. In particular, modellinkage and the integration of processes that operate on different spatialand temporal scales are problems that must be addressed. 19 refs., 5figs.</TEXT></DOC>
