If the 1990 census proves these figures correct, the U.S. population will have grown by only 10.3% this decade, the lowest rate in U.S. history except for the Depression years of the 1930s, when it was 7.2%. The projections also indicate record low growth in the near future: 7.2% in the 1990s and 5.3% between 2000 and 2010.    But the bureau foresees wide variation from state to state. For example, it expects that during the 1980s, four states (Iowa, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio) will together have lost nearly 300,000 people. At the other extreme, the four fastest-growing states (Arizona, Nevada, Florida and Alaska) are expected each to have grown more than 30%, adding a total of 4.6 million people.    Fastest growth doesn't mean most growth, however. About half of total U.S. growth for the rest of the century will occur in just three states -- Texas, Florida and California -- which are expected to gain 12 million people in the 1980s and 9.5 million in the 1990s.    ---                     Winners and Losers             (Percentage change in population)    Fastest-growing states          1980-1990                      1990-2000    Alaska            43%          Arizona          23%    Arizona           38           Nevada           21    Nevada            35           New Mexico       21    Florida           32           Florida          20    New Mexico        25           Georgia          19    Biggest-losing/slowest-growing states          1980-1990                      1990-2000    Iowa              -5.4%        Iowa             -7.6%    W.Virginia        -4.8         W.Virginia       -7.3    Pennsylvania      -0.3         North Dakota     -4.7    Ohio              -0.1         Pennsylvania     -2.7    Michigan          +0.3         Wyoming          -2.6   Source: Census Bureau   ---   Interstate Migration   Plays a Key Role   THE CENSUS Bureau's projections assume that past trends in birth, death and migration rates will continue. Natural increase (births minus deaths) varies little from state to state, so interstate migration is often the key in determining future populations. For example, Michigan is projected to gain 435,000 people from natural increase during the 1990s -- but lose 498,000 to out-migration.   While all 50 states are expected to show positive natural increase this decade, 24 will see that growth partially or completely offset by people leaving. Positive natural increase is seen for most states during the next decade as well, but Florida could be an unusual case. It is projected to have 20,000 more deaths than births between 1990 and 2000. A net in-migration of 2.6 million, though, will overwhelm this negative natural increase.   Many factors can influence migration, perhaps even government intervention. New York state, which lost population in the 1970s, has lowered personal income tax rates and some business taxes. Coincidentally or not, it is expected to gain 215,000 people this decade.   Workers Seen Carrying   Fewer Dependents   PROMISING A lighter burden of support, the overall dependency ratio in the U.S. is expected to decline to 57 by 2010 from 62 in 1987. The ratio measures the number of dependents (children under 18 and people 65 and older) for every 100 nondependents (those 18 to 64).   The number of nondependents will rise 17% between 1990 and 2010, while that of dependents will grow only 7%, according to the Census Bureau's forecast. However, these figures mask differences between the young and the elderly, as well as among geographic regions.   The number of people 65 and older is projected to grow 25% between 1990 and 2010, raising the elderly dependency ratio to 21.9 from 20.5. The ratio for those under 18 will drop to 34.8 from 41.5, as fewer children are born.   The dependency ratio is based strictly on age groups and makes no assumptions about true dependence. In fact, more than 10% of the elderly were employed in 1987, and only 72% of working-age people were actually working.   Study Profiles Network   Of Family Support   MORE THAN FOUR million Americans provide financial support to seven million young children living outside their households, according to another new Census Bureau report; two million provide support to three million adults outside their homes, mostly elderly parents. Of these providers, 6% are helping both children and adults who don't live with them. The bureau estimates that payments total $19 billion a year.   The typical provider is a divorced father 25 to 44 years old. On average, providers have an annual family income of $37,800 and pay $3,000 a year in support; those supporting both kids and adults average $43,500 in income and $8,400 in support annually. The largest amount of support -- an average of $7,800 -- goes to spouses who are separated or temporarily living apart. Ex-spouses get the next-largest chunk, averaging $4,700 each. Children 21 and older receive an average of $3,800 a year; those under 21 get $1,600 on average. Parents receiving support get an average of $1,500.</TEXT></DOC>
