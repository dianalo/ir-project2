Money is still pouring into stock funds at a brisk clip.But fund company executives say sales have slowed a bit sinceApril 17, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above3000 for the first and only time. Since then, stock priceshave slid steadily backward.</LP><TEXT>   Neverthless, April's stock fund inflows probably outpacedthose of March, when stock funds pulled in $1.9 billion morethan they surrendered to departing shareholders. March'sinflow was markedly lower than February's, when stock fundsattracted $3.1 billion, according to figures releasedyesterday by the Investment Company Institute, the fundindustry's trade group.   (These figures include stock fund sales less redemptions,plus the net result of switches between stock funds and otherfunds in the same fund family. Reinvested dividends areexcluded.)   &quot;After all the euphoria we've had over the last fewmonths, you would expect that investors might think twice andpull out their money,&quot; says Tim Pitts, an executive vicepresident with New York's Oppenheimer Management Corp. &quot;We'veseen no indication of that whatsoever. They've slowed theirbuying, but they haven't started taking money out ofequities.&quot;   Despite the recent easing in stock fund purchases, Mr.Pitts says that April will be Oppenheimer's best month everfor stock fund inflows.   Other fund groups also report strong cash inflows duringApril. Janus Group has had record cash inflows this month,and Financial Funds and T. Rowe Price Associates say Aprilmay be their best month ever for stock fund inflows.   During April, money continued to pour into funds thatspecialize in small-company stocks. &quot;Although the overallflow {into stock funds} has moderated, the lion's share isgoing into the more aggressive funds,&quot; reports Gavin Quill, amarketing analyst with Scudder, Stevens andamp; Clark.   Stock funds that buy health-care stocks are alsoattracting heaps of new money. Financial Funds' health-carespecialty fund was its best-selling fund this month, andFidelity Investments' three health-care sector funds havealso remained popular. &quot;There's been some profit-taking, butthere's also been strong new sales,&quot; says Michael Hines, aFidelity marketing vice president.   Cash inflows have also stayed strong at Vanguard Group'shealth-care fund, despite the best efforts of VanguardChairman John Bogle. In mid-March, Mr. Bogle sent a letter toshareholders of Vanguard's health-care specialty fund,warning that the fund's recent spectacular performance wasunlikely to continue.   Result? This month, the Vanguard fund's cash inflowdropped by a third compared to March. But the fund stillranked as the fund group's fifth best-selling stock fund.   Through the early part of this year's rally, stock fundmanagers stayed resolutely bearish. Investors may have beenputting cash into stock funds, but stock fund managersweren't putting all of the cash to work in the stock market.During February, for instance, cash held by stock fundmanagers jumped by almost $2 billion to $29.7 billion.   But in March, stock fund managers started buying inearnest and cut back their cash holdings by $1.4 billion, to$28.3 billion. Cash held by stock fund managers is now downto 9.9% of stock fund assets, the lowest level since July1989.   While stock fund inflows seem to be slowing, bond andincome funds are surging in popularity. During March, $3.6billion poured into bond funds, up from $3.1 billion inFebruary. March's inflow was the largest since March 1987,when bond funds attracted $9.9 billion just ahead of theApril 1987 bond market crash.   Among the best-selling categories of bond fund duringMarch were municipals, high-yielding junk bonds, global bondsand Government National Mortgage Association bond funds.Together, these four categories accounted for 93% of themoney coming into bond funds.   Sales of all four categories have benefited from the dropin short-term interest rates. The average taxable money fundis now yielding less than 6%, and that has caused someinvestors to move into bond funds to pick up extra yield.   The surge of cash into bond funds continued during April,say fund company executives. &quot;The {bond fund} business is offthe charts,&quot; says Fidelity's Mr. Hines. &quot;It's the best monthwe've had for years.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
