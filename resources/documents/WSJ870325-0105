More than two years after going private in a leveraged buyout, Tiffany's is planning a stock offering that could raise $92 million and put 48% of the company in the public's hands.    The company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial offering of four million common shares. Tiffany's is currently estimating the price of the offering at between $21 and $23 a share.    At $23 a share, the entire company has an indicated value of $190.9 million, based on the 8.3 million shares that will be outstanding after the offering, which is expected in late April or early May.    Of the four million shares being offered, about two million will be sold by the company, and two million will be sold by current shareholders. Those shareholders include Investcorp, an international investment banking concern; General Electric Credit Corp., a unit of General Electric Co.; and a Tiffany's management group. All three shareholder groups will retain some of their holdings after the sale.    Thomas A. Andruskevich, senior vice president, finance, and chief financial officer, said the proceeds of the stock offering will be used to pay debt. Mr. Andruskevich said that after the sale, the company's long-term debt would be reduced to $8.6 million from $49.6 million.    In the year ended Jan. 1, Tiffany's had earnings from operations of $21.9 million on sales of $182.5 million.    Tiffany's, a 150-year-old retailer of fine jewelry and gift items, was sold to Avon Products Inc. in 1979 for stock then valued at about $105 million. In the next five years, Avon said it invested an additional $53 million in the company. Avon tried to steer Tiffany's toward a wider audience by expanding catalog operations and adding lower-priced merchandise. The new approach apparently never caught on and alienated many of Tiffany's regular customers.    In 1983, Tiffany's profit fell 16% to $2.1 million from $2.5 million a year earlier. Sales in 1983 were $125 million.    In 1984, Avon decided to sell Tiffany's and concentrate on its beauty, health care and direct mail operations. In August of that year, Avon agreed to sell Tiffany's to an investor group led by William R. Chaney, Tiffany's chairman, for $135.5 million. The group, which included other members of Tiffany's management and some international investors, took the company private through a leveraged buyout.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors buys a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. At the time, Mr. Chaney, who is still chairman, said Tiffany's would again focus on the &quot;consumer who wants the best.&quot;    Because Tiffany's, which has eight retail stores in the U.S., is almost a household word, analysts expect the stock offering to attract healthy interest among investors. &quot;When the larger, well-known companies go public, there's an immediate response to take a look at the company,&quot; said Paul Simmons, a researcher for a national newsletter on stocks called New Issues. &quot;But then you're going to treat it just like everything else -- unless they're going to give you a discount on your jewelry.&quot;    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. is the lead underwriter.
