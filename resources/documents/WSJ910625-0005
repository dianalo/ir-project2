The expected investment by British Air is double the sixbillion francs mentioned in statements last month by SabenaChairman Pierre Godfroid. At the time, Mr. Godfroid said onlythat the likely partner would be either British Air or AirFrance.</LP><TEXT>   Sabena officials gave no further details of thenegotiations, and a British Air spokesman declined tocomment.   Talks between Sabena and Air France continue, however. &quot;Weare having discussions about marketing agreements withSabena, and I stress they are about marketing,&quot; Air Francespokesman Mathieu Dousset said. He declined to give anydetails of the negotiations.   Some analysts were surprised at the figure of 12 billionfrancs. &quot;It suggests that what British Air is getting mayhave changed,&quot; said Daniel Kasper of Harbridge House Inc.&quot;That's a very substantial investment to make without someability to go in and clean house.&quot;   The negotiations with British Air are, indeed, one facetof an effort to restructure Sabena and restore it toprofitability. The airline expects to post group-operatinglosses of 4.25 billion francs for this year after a loss of6.6 billion francs last year.   The Belgian government stands ready to give an aid packageof 35 billion francs to the airline, but must first getapproval from the European Community Commission. The packagealready has the blessing of the EC transport commissioner.</TEXT></DOC>
