The Solidarity leader said unity is needed if oppositioncandidates are to win National Assembly seats in next month'selections, which will be partially free.   Also on Wednesday, talks to settle a 5-day-old strike at fourcopper mines broke down and miners accused management of backingdown from pay promises, the Solidarity Information Service reported.   Barbara Hrybacz, a Solidarity spokeswoman, said the strike hadappeared near an end Tuesday morning when a management offer of a50 percent increase after 11 hours of talks satisfied strikers'original demands.   Government ministers told the miners later that authoritiescould not favor one sector by granting their pay demands andappealed for an end to the strike, state TV reported.   Workers in the hall at the Huta Warszawa steel plant grilledWalesa for over an hour about the elections, union policy and thecopper strikes.   A Solidarity splinter group led Seweryn Jaworski of HutaWarszawa has urged a boycott of the elections on grounds they arenot completely free.   On Tuesday, however, Jaworski sat on the speaker's platform withWalesa, advisers Jacek Kuron and Bronislaw Geremek, and ZbigniewBujak, Solidarity leader of the Warsaw region.   ``We have a chance to make the Poland of our dreams,'' Walesadeclared. ``Today, we have all the opportunities. There is aterrible struggle ahead of us, so we have to get to work.''   ``I would like to hear the problems that hurt you. ... I camehere to be wiser. I would like to be directed by you,'' he said inbrief introductory remarks.   The first questioner shouted at Walesa: ``How can you be surethat we will have completely free elections in four years?''   He replied: ``We can't be sure, where is our certainty? It iswritten at the round table. My question is whether we will takeadvantage of it. Our purpose is to get full democratic elections inthe next term.''   His reference was to the ``round table'' agreements concludedwith the government April 5 that legalized Solidarity after aseven-yar ban and provide for the elections in June.   Under the agreement, the opposition can run candidates for 161of the 460 seats in the Sejm, the current unicameral parliament,and for all 100 seats in a 100-member Senate in the new NationalAssembly. The next elections in four years time are to be fullydemocratic.   Walesa and his advisers have said they support the elections asan evolutionary way to democracy that can help end the CommunistParty's monopoly on political and economic power.   ``Today we are together,'' he said Tuesday. ``The elections willdecide who is the appropriate person and who is not.''   Workers at the meeting criticized Walesa for not calling aSolidarity congress for guidance in negotiations with thegovernment, and he responded: ``There was no time for democracy. Iwent there to get Solidarity.''   When asked about the copper strikes, he repeated his argumentthat everyonw in Poland has a reason to strike for more money butthe most important issue for Solidarity is organization.   ``We have to solve the most significant things,'' he said.``There is a dangerous struggle. We have an opportunity forcivilized, organized actions. Let's get ourselves organized.''   Stability is vital if Poland is to receive Western economic aid,he said.   Walesa works as a shipyard electrician in Gdansk and led thestrike that gave birth to Solidarity in 1980 as the firstindependent union in the Soviet bloc. Solidarity was outlawed in1982, under martial law, and Walesa won the Nobel Peace Prize in1983.   Industry Minister Mieczyslaw Wilczek and Jozef Oleksy, ministerfor trade unions, made the government appeal for an end to the minestrike at a meeting with representatives of Solidarity and officialunions, state TV reported.   The four mines, employing about 20,000 miners, are near Lubin insouthwestern Poland and produce most of the natin's copper. Thestrike committee said 15,000 miners were suporting the labor action.   Oficial media said the strike had cut production by about100,000 tons daily and the daily financial loss was about $2.8million.</TEXT></DOC>
