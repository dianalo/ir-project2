MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   At a moment of standstill and silence in U.S.contacts with Iran, President-elect Bush says he can visualize a dayof better relations _ a comment he hopes may help ``unlock thelocks'' that bind nine American hostages.   Bush spoke in general terms, saying that a time of change inadministrations also can be a time of change in troubledrelationships abroad.   ``I don't start off with the view that we always have to be atloggerheads with Iran,'' the president-elect said in a recentinterview with The Associated Press.   He said Iran also could take steps, beginning with the hostageimpasse, to demonstrate a desire for better ties with Washington.   Bush becomes president on Friday, eight years almost to the hourfrom the release of the 52 U.S. Embassy hostages who were held inTehran for 444 days and freed when President Reagan took office.Jimmy Carter's final days as president were marked by intense,indirect negotiations with Iran for the release of those captives.   That history has given rise to speculation about the possiblerelease of American hostages in Lebanon as Bush succeeds Reagan. Themilitant Shi'ite Moslem kidnappers are aligned with Iran, and aState Department official said Tehran can control their fate.   ``There was a lot of speculation back in October and Novemberthat the hostages might be freed, because of the parallel at the endof the Carter administration,'' the official said, speaking oncondition of anonymity. But he said there have been no openings andno negotiations like those eight years ago.   Nor have there been talks on Reagan's offer to pay compensationto the families of 290 people killed on July 3, when a U.S. warshipshot down an Iran Air jetliner over the Persian Gulf.   Vice President Bush went to the United Nations to present theU.S. case that the passenger plane was downed after being mistakenfor a warplane. At the Security Council, he called it a `terriblehuman tragedy,'' but said Iran shares responsibility because thecivilian plane was sent on a path over a warship engaged in combat.   Bush and his high command intend to stand on a policy that rulesout paying a price for release of American hostages, on the groundthat if kidnapping is seen as a profitable venture, U.S. citizensaround the world will be put at risk.   That was Reagan policy, too, but the administration shipped armsto Iran to try to gain hostages' release. Three Americans were freedin Lebanon during the arms deal period of 1985 and 1986.   Nine Americans and seven citizens of other nations are heldhostage in Lebanon. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondentof The Associated Press, is the American held longest; he waskidnapped by gunmen on March 15, 1985.   While State Department analysts believe Iran controls the hostagesituation, Bush said in the interview that while Tehran clearly hasinfluence, he is not certain that that government has full control.   Bush said that as president he will be ``alert to opportunity''to gain freedom for hostages, leaving no trail unexplored. ``I'm onewho thinks that some day we will have better relations with Iran,''he said. ``And I'm one who thinks it's in our interest to havebetter relations with Iran. And I'm one who thinks that Iran cantake a handful of steps and demonstrate that they want betterrelations with the United States.   ``And so to the degree Iran holds the key, holds most of the keysto unlock the locks, that could be helpful,'' the president-electsaid.   But Bush said he does not hold ``the naive view that if you havesome dramatic meeting, that's going to result in the instant releaseof hostages who are not held by Iran and in some instances may beheld by clients of Iran.''   Bush said his interview comments visualizing better relationswould send a message to Iran _ ``They'll read this, they know me ...they know our administration.''   But Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi discounted the Bushcomments, calling them an effort to justify U.S. policy. At a newsconference in Rome on Tuesday, Musavi repeated Tehran's insistancethat the hostage issue is an ``internal question of Lebanon,'' notone for Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
