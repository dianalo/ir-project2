The 14 specialists returned from Bangkok to Honolulu after Laosfailed to give them clearance to enter for the project that was tobegin Saturday, said Ross Petzing, spokesman of the U.S. Embassy inBangkok.   Petzing said the United States appreciated Laos' past cooperationin accounting for Americans missing from the Indochina war, andadded: ``We hope this mission can be rescheduled.''   It was to have been the fifth joint excavation of a U.S. warplanecrash site to account for 547 Americans listed as missing in actionfrom the war that ended in 1975. The U.S. experts on the excavationsare from the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center and the ArmyCentral Identification Laboratory, both based in Honolulu.   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said on Monday heunderstood the delay was related to an annual U.S. government reportthe previous week critical of Laos' performance in internationalefforts to curb drug production and trafficking.   The report listed a handful of countries that it declaredineligible for U.S. aid because of their support for drugtrafficking. In the report, President Bush recommended that Burmaand Laos be added to that list.   Opium production is expanding in Laos, the report said. Evidenceof extensive involvement in the narcotics trade by Laotian militaryand civilian officials ``suggests that this is a matter of de factogovernment policy,' it said.   A March 4 broadcast over official Laotian radio denied thegovernment encouraged anyone in the drug trade and said it wasactually cracking down on it.   ``The U.S. act of linking Laos to a narcotics issue andannouncing the suspension of its aid to Laos is unreasonable andunconstructive,'' it said.   Nevertheless, Laos will ``continue to fulfill our pledge ofgiving cooperation to the United States in the search for theremains of U.S. MIAS,'' it said.</TEXT></DOC>
