Sesit (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDA </CO><IN> MON FRX PCS CMD </IN><TEXT>   After the dollar rose last week to its highest point in a year against the mark, currency markets are poised for a confrontation with central banks if the U.S. currency continues to climb.    At the same time, analysts warn that the Federal Reserve faces a clash between its domestic and international policy goals. Moreover, some say Friday's resignation of Treasury Secretary James Baker could leave a question as to who is the Reagan administration's chief spokesman on exchange-rate policy at a critical juncture.    In late Friday New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8950 marks, up from 1.8795 marks late Thursday. The dollar rose to 133.88 yen from 133.00 yen. The pound fell to $1.6895 from $1.7079.    In Tokyo Monday, the U.S. currency opened at 133.80 yen.    Traders said the West German Bundesbank and Fed intervened Friday, selling dollars for marks. They said the amounts were small and the action was interpreted as more an attempt to smooth volatility and slow the dollar's ascent than to stop it. Even so, economists say data on foreigncurrency holdings of the Fed indicate the central bank recently has been intervening heavily to damp the dollar's rise.    &quot;We have a major challenge on our hands,&quot; said Nicholas P. Sargen, a director at Salomon Brothers Inc. The U.S. currency's strength poses another challenge for central banks &quot;to keep the dollar within its G-7 trading ranges. If the dollar broke through 1.90 (marks), it could test 1.95 or even higher.&quot; Besides the U.S., the G-7, or so-called Group of Seven industrial countries, includes Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.    Some traders expect the central banks to defend the 1.90-mark plateau next week. &quot;I think they'll all come in again&quot; and &quot;try to stop the almighty upsurge,&quot; said David Godwin, a vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.    For weeks, West Germany has vigorously tried to defend its currency with large dollar sales and interest-rate rises. Traders don't expect that policy to change but contend that to be effective, it will require U.S. cooperation.    If allowed to persist, a stronger dollar eventually could undermine G-7 attempts to reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit and correspondingly high Japanese and West German surpluses, many economists say.    The immediate explanation for the dollar's jump Friday was the Labor Department's strong report on non-farm employment in July. But other indicators have depicted a U.S. economy expanding at a much faster pace than many analysts and the Fed had expected.    This, in turn, has raised anxiety about rising U.S. inflation and interest rates -- something that increases the allure of dollar assets to international investors. In addition, the U.S. trade deficit generally has improved over the past few months, while second-quarter growth in Japan and Europe has slowed.    In response to the stronger U.S. currency and economy, European investors have been increasing their holdings of U.S. securities after easing up on the dollar portion of their portfolios for three years, said Mr. Sargen. Japanese investors also recently stepped up their buying of foreign bonds, most of which are assumed to be dollar-denominated.    Since the end of 1987, the dollar has risen nearly 21% against the West German currency and currently stands at its highest level since it hit 1.8958 marks in Frankfurt on Aug. 11, 1987.    Despite the fact August markets are normally thinner and more erratic because senior traders are on holiday and banks often reduce their positions, &quot;what happens Friday afternoon usually continues next week,&quot; said Kevin Logan, a vice president at Citicorp Investment Bank.    Still, currency markets remain nervous. &quot;Traders on balance believe (the dollar's recent climb) is overdone, but whenever anybody tries to go short dollars, they get hurt,&quot; said Varick Martin, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.    Some dealers said they were surprised the dollar didn't rise further on Friday and added they were puzzled by the lack of vigorous central bank intervention.    They said the dollar is trading just below what they considered the upper limit of the secret trading bands the Fed and other G-7 central banks agreed to last December. Economists and traders believe the &quot;band of tolerance&quot; to be 1.60 to 1.90 marks and 120 to 140 yen.    U.S. officials, however, have said it is impossible to figure specific ranges from central-bank intervention activity because the banks act for a variety of reasons.    But &quot;the Fed has a policy problem: Its domestic and international objectives are in conflict,&quot; said Anne Parker Mills, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. &quot;Domestically the Fed has been tightening monetary policy to dampen potential inflationary pressure in the face of stronger-than-expected economic growth and at the same time intervening to hold down the value of the dollar.&quot;    In the face of further evidence on Friday of a robust U.S. economy, &quot;the Fed knows it's got to tighten, but an aggressive tightening of monetary policy now could trigger a sharp rise in the dollar on the back of more overseas buying of dollar assets,&quot; warned Mr. Sargen.    To try to avoid such a scenario, Mr. Sargen predicted the Fed will move cautiously: Letting the Federal funds rate -- which banks charge each other for overnight loans -- rise 0.25 percentage point to a range of about 8% to 8.25%. The central bank, he says, will refrain from more visible action such as a discount rate boost.    A stronger dollar helps damp U.S. inflation by making imports less expensive, but analysts believe that the Fed's main concern is battling strong domestic inflationary pressures -- a strategy that requires a tighter domestic monetary policy.    But the Fed must continue to balance those domestic concerns against worries about a too-strong dollar. In this sense, Secretary Baker's departure occurs at an awkward time, said analysts.    Nicholas F. Brady, Mr. Baker's successor, isn't expected to change U.S. policy. Noting the high profile Mr. Baker took on U.S. currency policy, several analysts wondered who would assume that role -- and how quickly. Traders said the resignation, which had been anticipated for several weeks, already had been discounted.    Ms. Mills of Shearson said the currency situation &quot;was a problem of a weak Deutsche mark as well as a strong dollar.&quot; She said the mark was also weak relative to the pound and yen.    &quot;Germany is being regarded more and more as a high-cost producer of goods, and money will flow more and more to countries that produce more efficiently,&quot; said Christopher S. Bourdain, a senior financial markets adviser at BankAmerica International.    Ms. Mills predicted: &quot;If we get a good trade number (on Aug. 16), we'll be through 2.00 marks very quickly.&quot;    On New York's Commodity Exchange Friday, gold for current delivery settled at $432.30 an ounce, down $1.10. Estimated volume was a light 2.2 million ounces.    In Hong Kong, gold was quoted at $431.70 an ounce in early trading Monday.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Friday, August 5, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
