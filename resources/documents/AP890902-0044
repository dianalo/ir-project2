The alleged ringleader of the mob, Joseph Fama, was ordered heldwithout bail Friday after he pleaded innocent to charges he shot andkilled 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins.   Prosecutors said Fama led the gang of up to 30 whites whoattacked Hawkins and three other black teen-agers in the Bensonhurstsection of Brooklyn on Aug. 23. They said Fama shot Hawkins fourtimes at close range.   Fama fled after the shooting and was a fugitive until hesurrendered Thursday to police in Oneonta, 175 miles north of NewYork. He was returned to Brooklyn, where witnesses identified him ina lineup, said Assistant District Attorney Paul Burns.   Fama's attorney, David A. DePetris, entered an innocent plea onbehalf of his client, charged with murder, assault, criminalpossession of a weapon, menacing, riot and aggravated harassment.   The killing led to a week of protests and heightened racialtensions in the city. Hours after Fama was returned to Brooklyn onThursday, those at the head of a protest march involving anestimated 8,000 people clashed with officers at the foot of theBrooklyn Bridge. Two protesters and 44 officers were injured, policesaid.   Six other Bensonhurst youths have been arrested in the attack,and two of them _ Keith Mondello, 19, and Pasquale Raucci, 18 _ havebeen indicted on murder charges.   They pleaded innocent at an arraignment Friday and Justice JohnJ. DeLury allowed Mondello freed on $100,000 bail and Raucci on$75,000 bail.   That decision outraged Hawkins' family and their supporters.   The Rev. Al Sharpton, an adviser to the Hawkins family,interrupted an interview that reporters were conducting withMondello's lawyer, Stephen Murphy, and called him a murderer.   ``We're going to get you this time, Murphy,'' Sharpton screamed.``We'll see you tomorrow in Bensonhurst.''   A few minutes later, outside the courthouse, a Sharpton supporterattacked a WNYW-TV camera crew that was taping the Hawkins' family.   Station spokeswoman Barbara Ware said technician Barbara Lloydwas treated for back injuries and cameraman Nick Jutchenko formultiple injuries. The two said they would file a complaint againstthe attacker.   New York Newsday photographer Lilliana Nieto also was attacked bythe group while she took photographs of Ms. Lloyd being attacked.She said Sharpton yelled ``Get her'' and someone smacked her in theface and head.   Sharpton later telephoned the television station and apologizedfor the attacks.</TEXT></DOC>
