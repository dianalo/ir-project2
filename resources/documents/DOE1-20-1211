<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-20-1211 </DOCNO><TEXT>The use of variable-metric (or quasi Newton) methods with optimal controltheory is an attractive method for automatic reservoir history matching.Optimal control theory provides for an efficient calculation of the gradientof the performance index, and variable-metric methods are the most efficientand accurate of the minimization methods that require only the evaluationof the performance index and its gradient. Four variable-metric methods- the BFGS method, the Fletcher's switch algorithm, a self-scaling variable-metricmethod, and an optimally conditioned self-scaling variable-metric method- are tested with hypothetical single-phase reservoir history matchingproblems. All four methods yield significantly more accurate estimateswith considerable less computer effort than a previous history matchingalgorithm which uses the steepest descent method. Of the variable-metricmethods, the BFGS and Fletcher's switch algorithms perform especiallywell.</TEXT></DOC>
