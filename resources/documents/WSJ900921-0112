In the civil suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan,the agency also asserted that the alleged scheme was carriedout with the secret approval of Charles Keating, the failedthrift's former owner. The lawsuit alleges that thedefendants won Mr. Keating's cooperation by arranging forAmerican Continental Corp., Lincoln Savings' parent company,to receive favorable treatment from Saudi European Bank, asmall merchant bank that was based in Paris and acquired lastyear by Maison Bouygues, a unit of Bouygues S.A. of France.</LP><TEXT>   The lawsuit seeks compensatory and special damages of atleast $18 million, which could be tripled to $54 millionunder the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, orRICO, law. The suit seeks additional damages totaling $90million for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty.   The lawsuit says each of the defendants can be held liablefor the entire amount of damages sought, because they werealleged co-conspirators in the scheme.   Mr. Keating wasn't named as a defendant in the suit. TheRTC, which was created to sell and merge insolvent thrifts,already has a $1.1 billion civil racketeering suit pendingagainst Mr. Keating, who also was indicted on criminalcharges earlier this week.   Regulators have estimated that the collapse of Irvine,Calif.-based Lincoln Savings could cost taxpayers more than$2.5 billion. Officials charge that Lincoln Savings wasengaging in many such transactions that benefited AmericanContinental at the expense of the thrift, which held morethan $4 billion in government-insured deposits. AmericanContinental filed for bankruptcy-law protection in April1989.   The lawsuit filed yesterday centers on an $18 millioninvestment Lincoln Savings made in Saudi European InvestmentCorp., a Saudi European Bank affiliate, in 1984.   The lawsuit alleges that Lincoln Savings and otherinvestors were defrauded in a securities offering that wassupposed to raise $60 million to create a publicly tradedU.S. energy company. Instead, the lawsuit claims, the stockoffering was secretly oversubscribed, diluting the value ofthe investments, and the financing diverted to benefitcertain shareholders.   The lawsuit alleges that the defendants diverted at least$40 million from the oversubscribed stock offering. Forexample, the lawsuit says, in November 1984 -- immediatelyafter the offering was supposed to close -- the defendantsfraudulently used some of the funds to buy the U.S. tradingdivision of Gulf Oil Corp., a unit of Chevron Corp.   &quot;Defendants' transactions for their personal benefitimpaired the financial condition of {Saudi EuropeanInvestment Corp.}, thereby lessening the value of the sharesheld by the plaintiffs and damaging them,&quot; the lawsuit said.   The RTC said in its suit that Mr. Keating's company,American Continental, first raised questions with SaudiEuropean Investment Corp. about the diluted investments. Toconceal the alleged scheme, the lawsuit states, SaudiEuropean Bank arranged a business venture with AmericanContinental that enabled the company to post a profit for1987.   Along with Saudi European Bank and its investmentaffiliate, the other defendants named in the suit includeRichard A. Fenn of Pawling, N.Y., a Saudi European Bankofficial; Jamal Radwan, a Saudi European Investment officialwhose address couldn't be determined; Ronald F. Reilly ofWeston, Conn., who allegedly acted as an agent for Messrs.Fenn and Radwan; ALEF Bank, a management-service companyowned by Saudi European Investment and based in theNetherlands Antilles; and ALEF Investment Corp. of Paris.   Also named as defendants and charged with assisting in thescheme are two New York law firms, Gadsby andamp; Hannah andTownley andamp; Updike, and a Townley Updike attorney, MarioDiaz-Cruz III of New York.   Mr. Diaz-Cruz and Mr. Reilly each said separately lastnight that they were unaware the suit had been filed. None ofthe other defendants could be reached for comment last night.   The lawsuit noted that Saudi European Bank was sold toMaison Bouygues last December and renamed Societe de BanquePrivee S.A. In the lawsuit, the RTC charges that MaisonBouygues knew of the alleged fraud when it bought the bankand could be held liable for the allegations against SaudiEuropean Bank.</TEXT></DOC>
