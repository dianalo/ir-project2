Big banks are starting to give up some of their loan claims, provided they can share their losses with borrowing nations and with taxpayers in the U.S. and other industrialized countries.    There are tax advantages for banks in realizing some losses on their Third World credits. When a bank takes a loss on a credit by swapping it at a discount for equity investments, new bonds or cash, it sets the losses against its tax bill, thus depriving the Treasury of revenue and passing the cost indirectly to the taxpayer.    Some of the new methods for reducing debts, such as swapping discounted debt for investments in Chilean gold mines and Brazilian paper pulp companies, also offer banks the opportunity to make profits -- or risk further losses.    The prime candidate for expanded debt relief probably will be Mexico, which has generally been the pathfinder for new approaches to foreign bank debt. That nation's new president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who takes office in December, is eager to reduce his country's $104 billion foreign debt. And the U.S., because of Mexico's close economic and political ties and its record of responsible management of its debt problem, seems more willing to help that country than other big debtors.    &quot;Mexico is always a special case for the U.S.,&quot; said Paul Sacks, who heads Multinational Strategies Inc., a New York consulting firm that works on Latin American debt.    Only about $20 billion of Latin America's $350 billion foreign bank debt is going through debt-reduction programs this year. But that's about four times the amount so treated last year.    A panel of several senior bankers headed by former New York Federal Reserve Bank president Anthony Solomon and Rodney Wagner, vice chairman of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.'s credit committee, earlier this month said, &quot;Negotiated debt reduction has the potential to be an effective means for easing the debt burden of developing countries.&quot;    What has prompted large banks to rush to cut their Latin credits, even if it involves forgiving debt, is the increasingly unfavorable view analysts and equity investors have taken of banks' loans to Latin America. And over the past 18 months, as more banks have sold their loans in the small but growing market for such credits, prices for Latin American credits have generally fallen, further clouding perceptions of the nation's largest banks.    Increasingly the choice for banks is between giving debt relief or extending new credit. However, lending to heavily indebted developing nations is becoming less attractive to banks.    Although a general default by big Latin American borrowers has been avoided since Latin America became insolvent in 1982, there have been long interruptions of interest payments to banks, and the countries in the area have at best achieved weak and sputtering economic growth.    Brazil called a moratorium on its foreign bank debt on Feb. 19, 1987, and will probably only resume full interest payments this fall. Argentina is now almost $1 billion in arrears on interest payments. Almost no principal has been paid on Latin America's foreign debt since 1982, and many smaller debtors, such as Peru, Nicaragua and Bolivia, haven't even made interest payments for years.    Because of their billions of dollars of loans to such customers, the stock prices of such major New York banks as Chemical Banking Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. now languish below book value and often trade at a low multiple of only about five times annual earnings.    The main debt reduction or relief schemes so far tried by banks involve swapping loans at a discount for local currency or equity investments in such nations as Brazil and Chile; selling discounted bank debt back to such borrowers as Bolivia and Mexican private sector companies; and exchanging debt for new bonds with Mexico and Brazil.    Such new tradeable obligations, often called exit bonds, are less onerous to the borrower either because they carry a lower interest rate or a lower face value than the loans they replace.    &quot;Debt relief is no longer a taboo subject,&quot; said John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. Mr. Williamson, like many analysts of the international debt problem, said he expects more and larger debt reduction programs in 1989.    Voluntary debt reduction programs also may get a boost from the next U.S. presidential administration. Already the Reagan administration has given its blessing to some forms of debt relief provided they are voluntarily granted by creditors. The Treasury helped Mexico and J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. swap new bonds for old discounted loans early this year by issuing securities that were used to collateralize the new bond issue.    Latin American nations, facing higher international interest rates and electorates eager for renewed economic growth, also are likely to press harder for more extensive debt relief programs. The debt relief issue is likely to become more politically charged, particularly as Argentina and Brazil hold presidential elections in 1989.    Six years after Mexico ran out of money and sparked the international debt crisis, debt relief doesn't so readily threaten to bankrupt lenders. That's mainly because most large banks have since built stronger capital resources and have set up loan-loss provisions large enough to cope with the losses implicit in most of the voluntary debt relief programs tried so far.    Horst Schulmann, managing director of the Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based lobby group representing 183 banks and financial institutions from 38 nations, said international lending to heavily indebted nations is losing its attraction for banks. In a letter to senior International Monetary Fund and World Bank officials, he said, &quot;It is unrealistic to expect banks to provide&quot; $6 billion to $9 billion a year to heavily indebted middle-income nations, as a recent World Bank study envisaged.    Mr. Schulmann's letter anticipates the discussions of international debt at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank this week in West Berlin.    Like many senior bankers, Mr. Schulmann calls on the IMF, the World Bank and Western governments to do more to ease the debt problem, and also urged debtors to continue reforming and opening their economies. He singles out debt-for-equity swaps as the &quot;most satisfactory of these schemes to date.&quot; In debt-equity swaps, the discount on the debt is effectively shared by borrower and lender.    Brazil has led the way in debt-for-equity swaps this year. That nation's central bank president Elmo de Araujo Camoes estimated recently that between $7.5 billion to $8 billion of Brazilian foreign debt will be swapped for equity investments this year. So far in 1988, about $4.7 billion has been converted, he said. Chile also has swapped about $1.42 billion of debt so far this year, according to its finance minister, Hernan Buchi.    Debt-for-equity swaps can help boost investment, which has lagged in most debt-burdened nations. But such swaps have inflationary effects, and Brazil, which is battling inflation of 1,000% a year, may soon cut back its program. Also, through such swaps, banks may get involved in businesses they don't know well and may arouse nationalist antipathy to foreign ownership.    A simpler way to reduce bank debts that is more advantageous to borrowers are straight buy-backs in the growing secondary loan market. Buy-backs helped clear up Latin American debt problems in the 1930s. In March, Bolivia bought back just under half its $670 million bank debt at 11 cents for each dollar of debt.    But many banks only seem eager to go along with buy-backs in cases where the debtor is almost hopelessly poor, such as Bolivia. Buy-backs also generally involve all bank creditors having to waive certain loan covenants.    So far the only other widespread instance of their use is in the reduction of Mexican private sector debt. In the past five years, Mexico has almost halved its private-sector foreign debt, which totaled $14.5 billion as of March 31, down from $22.5 billion in 1983.    Chile this year amended its bank debt agreements to allow it to use as much as $500 million of reserves to buy back debt. And this week the country announced that it would be using $200 million to buy bank debt over the next two months.    Bankers and debt traders say Argentina has occasionally bought back its foreign debt through the foreign branches of its large banks. At present prices of about 22 cents for a dollar of Argentine debt, buy-backs are worthwhile for the country, these financiers say.    Bond swaps also are playing an increasingly important part. Brazil's recently proposed debt restructuring pact with foreign bank creditors includes provisions for as much as $5 billion of exit bonds. These tradeable securities carry a fixed annual interest rate of 6%, considerably below the rates of 10% and more that Brazil has to pay on most foreign bank debt.    ---                      Bank Debt and Relief                    (In billions of dollars)                      FOREIGN     NEGOTIATED                     BANK DEBT      RELIEF*     METHODS    Bolivia            $0.67         $0.27      Buy-back    Brazil             80.5           3.0       Debt/Equity                                                 Exit bonds    Chile              13.1           0.7       Debt/Equity                                                Buy-back    Mexico             82.7           3.0       Debt/Equity                                                Buy-backs                                                Bond swap    *Estimated to date    Source: Latin American central banks, market estimates.</TEXT></DOC>
