JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Applicants for civil service jobs no longerwill have to take written examinations under a new Reaganadministration policy that will rely solely on college grades orjob-related skills tests when hiring new workers.   Constance Horner, director of the Office of PersonnelManagement, said in a speech Thursday to a group of recruiters thatthe shift will allow the government ``to pursue high-qualitycandidates aggressively'' because they will be able to offer jobson the spot.   The new policy will allow recruiters to hire any collegegraduate with a minumum grade point average of somewhere between3.0 and 3.25 on a 4.0 scale. Others could be hired after passing anIndividual Achievement Record skills test related to whatever jobis being sought.   These tests, said the government agency, will measure ``the fullrange of relevant personal qualities required for successful jobperformance.''   ``We want the strongest possible civil service and we're goingto get it under this plan'' Ms. Horner said.   She said the government needs to change its criteria for hiringto compete with private industry in attracting job applicants.   ``The pool of young workers entering the job market will shrink(to) ... the lowest since the 1930s'' during the next decade. ``Forthe federal government this means that competition to hire andretain qualified candidates will be fiercer than ever,'' she told arecruiting conference.   She said current testing procedures are ``so slow andcumbersome'' that many of the best candidates for jobs go elsewhere.   Horner said she hoped the details of the plan could be workedout so the government could begin using the new hiring system bynext April.   Horner said in a speech to a conference attended by governmentrecruiters that the new approach to selecting entry-level workerswill allow the government access ``to the most intellectuallystrong, academically accomplished candidates'' and still ``ensure aworkplace reflective of American racial and ethnic diversity.''   But Robert M. Tobias, president of the National TreasuryEmployees Union, expressed concern about the change.   ``Hiring on the basis of GPAs (grade point average) is contraryto congressional intent that hiring be done through a competitiveexam that is nationwide in scope,'' he said.   Horner's proposal also was criticized by her OPM predecessor,Donald Devine, as ``a sad day for the civil service when it can'thave an objective civil service exam.''   The government has had no entrance test for more than 100 jobssince 1982 when the Professional and Administrative CareerExamination was discarded after it was deemed to be raciallydiscriminatory.   Since then, hiring has been done using a temporary specialprocess of interviews, recommendations and college grades that U.S.District Judge Joyce Hens Green ruled last year was ``arbitrary andcapricious.''</TEXT></DOC>
