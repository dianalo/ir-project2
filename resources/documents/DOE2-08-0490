We put special emphasis on estimatesof the theoretical uncertainties of these cross sections. For {sup 8}Band hep solar neutrinos, the averaged cross sections are andless;{sigma}({sup8}B)andgt; = 4.1(1 +- 0.1) x 10/sup -43/ cm{sup 2} and andless;{sigma}(hep)andgt; = 1.15(1+- 0.1) x 10/sup -42/ cm{sup 2}, respectively, where hep denotes {sup3}He+p. The cross-section uncertainty is negligible, +- 1/2%, for theratio of neutral-current to charged-current events. Independent of neutrinooscillations, the cross sections correspond to 4.5(1 +- 0.38) x 10{sup3} solar-neutrino events per year in the proposed one-kiloton SudburyNeutrino Observatory if the standard solar model is correct. For a galacticsupernova, the total number of neutral-current events expected in theSudbury detector is about 10{sup 3} (distance/8 kpc)/sup -2/; most ofthe signal is expected to arise from {mu} and tau neutrinos and antineutrinos.If either {mu} or tau neutrinos have a mass greater than 2 x 10{sup 2}eV, then this mass should be measurable using the neutrino signal froma galactic supernova.</TEXT></DOC>
