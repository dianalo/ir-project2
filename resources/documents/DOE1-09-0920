For promoting the desulfurizationand deashing, Miike coal needs to be crushed under 300 micron m. Thedeashing rate is higher than that of the desulfurization. The optimumtreating temperature and time are 623 K and 60 minutes. The coal is severelydecomposed above 623, and the loss of volatile matters is increased for60 minutes or longer. The desulfurization ratio is increased with increasein KOH concentration. However, decomposition of the coal itself proceeds,resulting in reduction of calorific value. The best KOH concentrationis about 50%. The clean coal has higher heating value than the originalcoal. The removal yields of sulfur and ash are 92% (sulfur residue 0.27wt%), and 96% (ash residue 0.58 wt%, db).(8 figs, 2 tabs, 4 photos, 15refs)</TEXT></DOC>
