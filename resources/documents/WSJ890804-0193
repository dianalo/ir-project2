The joint venture -- Armco Steel Co. Limited Partnership -- was formed May 13 when Armco sold a 40% interest in its Eastern Steel division for $350 million to Kawasaki Steel Corp. of Japan.    As part of the agreement, the joint venture agreed to assume the liability for various industrial revenue and pollution control bonds and provide Armco with the funds to pay them off in full or defease them by establishing trust funds to invest, manage and make interest and principal payments to maturity. </TEXT></DOC>
