Tempers certainly are heating up on both sides of the gun-control issue. Potshots are being fired from either side; yet the NRA seems to be hitting a few of its own supporters with stray bullets.    A showdown will inevitably occur. But a shootout is not the answer. An open dialogue must be instituted in order to present these views fairly. Freedom of speech is as fundamental a right as the freedom to bear arms.    We owe our freedom today to people who use firearms to maintain law and order and to those who protected our borders from the earliest days of the frontier. But there isn't much frontier left anymore, and I don't think the right to own rifles is even being debated.    The issue is handgun control and public safety. The spiral continues upward where law-abiding citizens feel they must buy guns to protect themselves from other people who may abuse them. I cannot conceive of a public benefit to legalizing plastic guns, but the point is that the public needs to hear the many sides to this story. The government is in no position to collect guns from the American public. Public awareness and education are the immediate concerns.    In order to be useful, the NRA must keep pace with the current issues and serve as a friend to the public's interest, and not be a narrow-minded, special-interest group protecting the future of its contributors. Lately, the NRA has shot itself in the foot, but that doesn't mean that it can't lead the way for safe and sensible gun usage. It just needs to listen before it speaks, or the NRA surely will go the way of the musket and be a tool of the past.    Peter R. Baldwin   Dallas</TEXT></DOC>
