 As hardware costs fall and systems become smaller andmore powerful, users' software demands become more and more complex.andM;A small but growing number of application developers are trying to helpsoftware development keep pace by employing computer-aided softwareengineering (CASE) tools.andM;These users are looking to CASE as a means of improving the quality of newsoftware and simplifying the modification of old applications.andM;CASE today is marked by a dizzying variety of products, vendors andtechnologies.andP;  As a result, there are few clear-cut solutions for everyapplication problem.andP;  Among the two dozen vendors selling DEC-compatible CASEproducts, only a handful own more than a tenth of the market share, and noneare clearly predominant.andM;One reason for the market's diversity is the wide range of applicationenvironments that CASE vendors try to address, from commercial to real-timeto aerospace- and defense-related applications.andM;For instance, some users need CASE packages to help them develop CADapplications.andP;  &quot;Their end product will be software that will be burned intohardware,&quot; commented Tony Wasserman, president and founder of InteractiveDevelopment Environments.andP;  &quot;They need analysis and emulation tools.&quot;andM;MIS TOOLSandM;Users developing MIS applications, on the other hand, require markedlydifferent development tools.andP;  Such users &quot;may want to design some screens,use a 4GL and hook to a database,&quot; Wasserman said.andP;  &quot;The nature of theirproducts and the tools they need are different.&quot;andM;Should all this variety cause fretting?andP;  Not for buyers who are willing toinvest time identifying which tools best suit their application goals.andP;  TheCASE market is young and still defining itself, but there are packages outthere that can help users develop applications with speed and quality.andM;Many vendors divide the application development life cycle into six phases,and CASE tools are available for each phase.andP;  A number of vendors also marketancillary products that are designed to help software developers.andP;  Theproducts are often called CASE tools but don't fall neatly into one of thesix life cycle phases.andM;The first two phases are addressed by front-end or upper-CASE tools, andinvolve analysis of the problem and design of the solution, respectively.andP;  Inthe first phase, structured analysis tools help users define the requirementsof the system they are designing.andP;  In the second phase, the design tools helpdetermine how to meet those requirements.andM;BACK-END TOOLSandM;Tools designed for the third through sixth phases are known as back-end orlower-CASE tools.andP;  In the third phase, application implementation, CASE toolsgenerate executable code in a 3GL or a 4GL.andM;The fourth phase involves testing tools that verify whether or not the codemeets the requirements defined earlier.andP;  In the fifth phase, debugging toolslocate errors in the code at the line level.andP;  And in the final phase, CASEtools can be used to maintain the new (or resurrected) software.andM;Because application developers have such diverse requirements, the CASEmarket has divided itself into three major segments.andM;Vaughan Merlyn, chairman of CASE Research, a consulting company located inBellevue, Wash., identifies these areas as MIS and commercial packages,engineering and embedded systems applications, and aerospace and defensesoftware.andM;Merlyn said that CASE technology for commercial applications lags three tofive years behind engineering and defense systems' CASE tools.andP;  The reason,he said, involves economics and product acceptance.andM;Commercial software developers tend to view their work as a craft rather thanas a quantifiable science, Merlyn said, and they resist the &quot;rigorousmethodology&quot; and the seemingly restrictive notion of engineeringapplications.andM;To date, commercial application developers haven't enthusiastically embracedCASE and therefore, commercial CASE tools have received less developmentalattention.andM;Engineers and aerospace application developers, on the other hand, &quot;tend totake an engineering view to building software,&quot; Merlyn said, and are far morereceptive to the methodological rigors that CASE tools impose.andM;So far, market analysts said, the majority of commercial CASE products runseither on IBM mainframes or on PC CASE applications that can be ported tomainframes.andM;Nevertheless, a number of companies selling VAX CASE tools for commercialapplications have flourished.andP;  As VAX CASE packages for commercialapplications improve and take advantage of distributed computingenvironments, analysts expect commercial CASE tools to attract morecustomers.andM;At present, the commercial CASE market's most active area involves providingtools for database management.andP;  Companies such as Cortex, Deft, InteractiveDevelopment Environments and Netron have introduced CASE tools withinterfaces to a range of popular relational database management systems.andM;These products assist database application developers every step of the way,from designing to populating databases.andP;  In addition, many CASE packagesinclude their own internal RDBMS.andM;Deft and 4GL vendor SmartStar of Goleta, Calif., recently announced theirintention to jointly develop Deft's forthcoming version 4.0 which willinclude an RDBMS conversion feature called relational portability, and thenew SmartStar Migration Tools.andP;  Scheduled for release in October, thecombined tools will let users migrate from one RDBMS to another, includingtranslating SQL procedures and routines.andM;The second CASE market segment consists of packages geared toward developingengineering applications and embedded systems.andP;  Engineers developing suchapplication must design systems where response to the environment and timingare critical.andM;Analysis and design methodologies developed during the 1970s, such asYourdon-DeMarco, typically centered on large MIS activities and focused ondata-driven information-processing problems.andP;  For real-time applicationneeds, however, such methodologies weren't sufficient.andM;Extensions to Yourdon-DeMarco and other methodologies were thereforedeveloped to expand their usefulness in designing reactive systems.andP;  Vendorssuch as Cadre, Ready Systems and Athena Systems have built CASE productsbased on those extensions.andM;Other vendors, such as i-Logix, found even these extensions inadequate anddeveloped their own methods of modeling reactive systems.andP;  ElizabethMcKinley, director of marketing for i-Logix, explains that &quot;in reactivesystem development, you must have tools that not only describe behavior, butalso simulate behavior before you commit to a design and build a system.&quot;andM;Statemate, i-Logix's system engineering tool, provides engineers withgraphical specification languages for designing systems, McKinley said.andO;These are formal languages that computers can interpret and execute, makingit possible for conceptual models to simulate system performance.andM;The third market segment, a close cousin of engineering and real-time systemdevelopment, has grown around the Department of Defense and its complex setof requirements for new systems.andP;  Applications developed in this area canhave millions of lines of code and are almost exclusively written in Ada.andM;&quot;If you are bidding on a mission-critical DoD system, you have to satisfythat system according to the DoD standard methodology,&quot; said CASE Research'sMerlyn.andP;  &quot;That methodology is extremely rigorous and bureaucraticallyintense, and is almost impossible to fulfill without CASE technology.&quot;andM;A number of CASE vendors have focused their efforts on the design of systemsthat conform to DoD-STD-2167, a Defense Department standard that specifieshow developers should create and document mission-critical software systems.andO;Leading products in this market segment include Nastec's RTrace andInteractive Development Environments' Software Through Pictures.andM;NEW CASE FROM DECandM;DEC's latest CASE development efforts have also focused on the defenseindustry.andP;  DEC recently announced the XD Ada MC68020, an Ada cross compilerthat supports the Motorola MC68020 microprocessor used frequently in embeddedsystems by aerospace and defense system developers.andM;The new cross compiler allows users to develop sophisticated embedded systemsthat require more than 1 million lines of Ada code.andP;  Combining DEC's VAX Adacompiler with code-generation technology from SD-Scicon of Hampshire,England, the product fully integrates VAX Ada, VMS and DEC's CASE tools.andM;DoD-STD-2167 also requires exhaustive documentation of each phase of theapplication development process.andM;Nastec's RTrace has made a name for itself by providing a requirementstracing capability that reaches back before the first of the life cycle's sixphases.andP;  DEC's VAX Document V1.2, which was announced along with DEC's newAda cross compiler, also supports DoD-STD-2167.andP;  Twenty out of the 32DEC-compatible CASE products conform to the DoD standard.andM;Vendors and analysts agree that DEC isn't a strong player in the CASE marketat present.andP;  DEC's internally developed products are primarily back-end toolsand many qualify as CASE tools only in the loosest definition of the term.andO;Six of these programs have been integrated and are sold as a bundle calledVAXset.andP;  VAXset comprises a language-sensitive editor, a source codeanalyzer, a performance and coverage analyzer, a regression testing tool, acode manager, and a module manager.andM;In addition, DEC has cooperative-marketing partner agreements with numerousthird-party vendors, such as Cadre and Nastec, that provide front-end tools.andO;DEC offers technical assistance to any partners that want to integrate theirproducts with DEC's, but the actual work of integration is left to thethird-party vendors.andP;  As a result, DEC CASE tool buyers can't mix and matchfront- and back-end tools as freely as they might like.andM;Case Research's Merlyn predicts that both DEC and IBM--at present anotherminor player in the CASE world--will eventually play a more significant rolein the CASE market.andP;  &quot;They are really not [strong]; but they desperately wantto be,&quot; Merlyn said.andP;  &quot;Both have pretty ambitious programs to get into it.andO;While right now you don't think of them [as CASE vendors], I think that willbe different a five years.&quot;andM;Clark Keller, director of aerospace, defense and engineering for Nastec,echoed that sentiment.andP;  &quot;I don't see [DEC] as a strong competitor yet,&quot; hesaid, &quot;but I think they probably will be once they make up their minds tobe.&quot;andM;If DEC and IBM push forward effectively in the CASE marketplace, theirsuccess might be a boon to the lower-profile CASE vendors.andP;  The reason?andO;Standards--or the lack thereof.andM;One of the factors inhibiting CASE's growth is the need for standardsdescribing how products from different vendors should exchange data andinteract.andP;  Research is being done on a number of possible CASE standards but,according to IDE's Wasserman, those standards are &quot;basically nowhere.&quot;andM;If IBM or DEC makes a serious effort in the CASE market, according to Merlyn,it might be able to set a de facto standard where none exists.andP;  Third-partyvendors could then step in with clones or cooperative programs that adopt thesame standard, and the entire market could grow.andM;Two proposals, based on ANSI's Information Resource Dictionary System (IRDS)and IBM's DB2, are currently being cultivated as information repositorystandards.andP;  Rob Hill, vice president of engineering for Deft, said that &quot;mostof the CASE vendors are working feverishly to develop IRDS-compliantproducts&quot; to avoid dependence on IBM.andM;Hill said that ANSI is also closely watching development activity within agroup promoting the CASE data interchange format (CDIF).andP;  CDIF defines astandard for importing and exporting data repository information.andM;Despite the flurry of activity surrounding CASE standards, don't expectcodified standards to emerge soon.andP;  &quot;I guess I'm a little skeptical,&quot; Deft'sHill said of the various standards initiatives.andP;  &quot;I think it's a move in theright direction, but I think it's going to take years.&quot;andM;Given the still-nascent condition of CASE standards, vendors interested indelivering products for the full software development life cycle have twochoices: They can write a full complement of products themselves or buildhooks between their own and other vendors' products.andM;A few vendors claim their CASE offerings can take users from initial analysisthrough final debugging.andP;  Cadre Technologies is one such vendor.andP;  InFebruary, the company merged with MicroCASE, a front-end CASE tool vendor,and as a result now claims to offer an integrated package for the full lifeof embedded systems development.andM;Most CASE vendors, however, are focusing on building strategic alliances withvendors who offer complementary CASE tools.andP;  Interactive DevelopmentEnvironments, for instance, offers hooks between its Software.andP;  ThroughPictures package and Atherton's Software Backplane, Interleaf's electronicpublishing software, Oracle's and Informix's RDBMSes, and other applications.andM;The company has also just announced an agreement with Verdix to provide aninterface between Software Through Pictures and Verdix's VADS, an Adadevelopment system, and plans to integrate Software Through Pictures withHewlett-Packard's new Softbench, a back-end CASE product.andM;Deft is also providing gateways to other vendors' software.andP;  By year's end,according to Model, Deft's CASE tools should be linked to DEC's Rdb, Oracle,Relational Technology's Ingres and Sybase, as well as with Software AG'sNatural Architect and Signal Technology's SmartStar.andM;For users in areas other than embedded systems, Cadre has integrated itsfront-end tools with back-end packages from Pansophic and RelationalTechnology.andM;According to Case Research's Merlyn, product integration is leading CASE intoits third evolutionary stage.andP;  Until the early '80s, Merlyn said, CASEdevelopment focused primarily on back-end tools--the &quot;lower-CASE era.&quot;andM;The period from the mid to late '80s has been &quot;the upper-CASE era, whereattention focused on upstream tools,&quot; he explained.andP;  &quot;Now, in the late '80sto early '90s, we are entering the third era of integrated CASE, where youcan buy tools that take you from diagrams to maintenance.&quot;andM;According to most market analysts and vendors, cost is a minor factor whenselecting CASE products.andP;  As with any software, prices vary according to thedevelopment platform and the number of users the license allows for.andP;  Butwhether a particular CASE product suits a buyer's applications is moreimportant.andM;Furthermore, obtaining a CASE tool is less expensive and less problematicthan training developers to use the tools efficiently and helping them adjustto the new way of doing things, according to CASE Research's Merlyn.andM;&quot;The technology is the smallest part of the cost and the smallest part of theproblem,&quot; Merlyn said.andP;  &quot;Focus on management problems.andP;  The real problem withCASE is the transition from software craft to systems engineering.&quot;andM;Nastec's Keller agrees that convincing application developers about CASE'sbenefits is often the most difficult step in making the transition to CASE.andM;&quot;We put people on the moon long before CASE came around,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Thereare a lot of people out there who know what they're doing, and it's not easyto get them to [switch to CASE].&quot;andM;TRAINING CONSIDERATIONSandM;Many CASE buyers don't take management issues into consideration, IDE'sWasserman said.andP;  &quot;Getting 200 people to understand data flow diagrams and usethe tools can be tough,&quot; he said.andM;Studies undertaken by CASE Research indicate that new CASE users requireapproximately 18 months before they employ CASE tools efficiently.andM;Typically, there is &quot;no immediate productivity payoff&quot; when users are firstintroduced to a CASE tool, he said.andP;  In fact, some users believe CASE helpsthem &quot;build bad systems more quickly.&quot;andM;One concrete product factor worth considering is the amount of training andsupport that vendors provide.andP;  Wasserman described two categories of CASEsupport: &quot;Some products come with maintenance, support and training from thevendor.andP;  With others, [the vendors] send you a shrink-wrapped box and wishyou luck.&quot;andM;The amount of support isn't usually reflected in product costs, Wassermansaid; costs per user tend to be the same for the well-supported and theshrink-wrapped alike.andM;Usage of CASE tools is still limited, particularly in the United States, butby all counts it is growing.andP;  Ten years ago, CASE was nonexistent.andP;  Today anestimated four or five percent of software developers--a meager but growingsegment--work with a CASE tool.andM;Les Hellenack, a market analyst with Framingham, Mass.-based InternationalData Corp. (IDC), estimates that approximately $225 million worth of CASEsoftware was sold into 21,000 sites last year.andP;  That amount will increase tomore than $900 million in 1993, Hellenack said.andM;IDE's Wasserman said the CASE market is entering a period of importantgrowth.andP;  &quot;CASE is in the process of moving from [being] tactical stuff wherecompanies spend $50,000 to $100,000, to [a more significant] strategic [role]where companies are spending half a million dollars or more,&quot; Wasserman said.andM;As standards emerge, products will become further integrated, vendors willrefine their tools and CASE packages will become increasingly attractive andviable application development counterparts.andP;  Like pioneers crossing thegreat American plains, CASE vendors have come a long way.andP;  Greater glory liesahead--for CASE users in particular.andM;BUYER'S TIPSandM;1 Match CASE tools to your development project.andP;  The type of system beingdeveloped, as well as its complexity, should dictate the CASE tools needed.andM;2 If you are buying CASE tools from more than one vendor, check how muchintegration work the vendors have already done and how much you will have todo yourself.andM;3 Look for integration between CASE tools and desktop publishing, databasemanagement or other software being used at your site.andM;4 Compare the level of educational and consulting services offered bydifferent CASE vendors.andM;5 Expect to spend time and money helping users adapt to and learn CASEmethods, and don't expect an immediate productivity payback.andM;Case Tools with a TwistandM;CASE tools have always been thought of as aids for developing new software,but several vendors are now offering CASE tools that promise to bring thebenefits of CASE to software that has already been written.andM;Hypersoft and Software Systems Design are two of the 13 companies offeringCASE tools that let users reverse-engineer existing code.andP;  Their CASE toolsprovide information about a given program's structure and the relationship ofvarious modules.andM;&quot;We're doing for the existing body of code what traditional CASE products dofor future design,&quot; said Dale Merrill, Hypersoft's sales manager.andP;  Users loadsource code for Cobol programs into Hypersoft's CASE tool, ApplicationBrowser.andP;  &quot;It then gives you information on the relationship between thevarious modules in the application,&quot; Merrill said.andP;  At present available onlyfor Cobol programs, Application Browser should be ready for C and Fortrancode by the end of the year, Merrill added.andM;&quot;Some of the people who are making the best use of the product are people whohave Cobol code that was written 20 or 25 years ago,&quot; Merrill said.andP;  &quot;It mayhave been written on an IBM system and ported to the VAX, [and] nobody reallyknows what it does.&quot;andM;Ada users can pick up a similar product from Software Systems Design.andO;According to President Tom Radi, the company offers a family of CASE toolsthat can analyze and diagram Ada code, analyze testing requirements, and thendocument the code.andP;  A C version of the program should be available by year'send, Radi said.andM;Deft has created a niche for itself with its Deft CASE tool, which bothreverse- and forward-engineers database systems.andP;  Andres Model, Deft'sdirector of sales, said the tool can be used either to design and modifyschemas and forms or to analyze existing database schemas and create diagramsthat describe them.andM;The Macintosh-based package at present has gateways to Ingres, Oracle andAdabas, and it should have hooks to Sybase and Rdb by year's end, accordingto Model.andM;Other CASE packages add twists to what many vendors consider &quot;typical CASE.andO;Jordan-Webb Info Systems, for instance, offers what President Paul E. Collinscalls &quot;a development environment for software&quot; that combines CASE, an expertsystem and database management technology.andM;&quot;The product is like a system analyst,&quot; Collins explained.andP;  Called Exsys, theproduct asks a series of questions from which it defines data, models, a rulebase and procedures.andP;  Using the information in that &quot;knowledge base,&quot; Collinssaid, the run-time portion of the system can execute the program.andM;The Software Backplane from Atherton Technology of Sunnyvale, Calif., isn't aCASE package per se but is designed to provide efficient environments forusing other CASE tools.andM;According to Alan Codkind, Atherton's vice president of marketing, TheSoftware Backplane integrates various vendors' CASE tools, providing a commonuser interface for each tool and allowing data to be shared between thetools.andM;In addition to providing modules that let users integrate many well-knownCASE tools, Codkind said, the product also lets users custom-design their ownintegrations of other CASE packages.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
