In addition, the firm's former managing partner, Peter M.Fishbein, after vehemently refusing to make any concessions,agreed to be barred from doing any work for banks or thriftscovered by federal deposit insurance. The provision involvingMr. Fishbein, who's still a partner, had been the mainobstacle to a settlement prior to last weekend'sround-the-clock negotiations in Washington, D.C.</LP><TEXT>   The agreement in principle -- expected to become finaltomorrow -- was announced six days after the federal Officeof Thrift Supervision filed its lawsuit seeking $275 millionfrom Kaye Scholer for allegedly withholding information fromthe agency concerning the activities and finances of a majorclient, Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association. In a tactic thatsapped Kaye Scholer's will to fight the charges, thegovernment also prevented all partners from disposing of anylaw-firm or individual assets without first securinggovernment approval.   Banks that routinely lent money to Kaye Scholer to help itmeet its payroll and regulate its cash flow quickly expressedconcern about whether the firm would be able to repay itsloans on a timely basis while laboring under the federalrestrictions. In addition, some clients of the 400-lawyerfirm based in New York raised questions about the firm'sfuture.   The settlement will lift the restrictions on law-firm andpartner assets and protect the firm from future governmentlawsuits related to its Lincoln representation. Kaye Scholeris believed to have at least $20 million in insurance tocover a good portion of the payments, which will be stretchedover a five-year period. The rest is likely to come frompartnership capital, rather than more directly from thewallets of individual partners.   The settlement also resolves allegations against twoindividual partners in addition to Mr. Fishbein. They areKaren E. Katzman, who agreed to be barred from doing work forfederally insured depositary institutions, and Lynn TobyFisher, who agreed not to engage in the future in any of theactivities charged in the suit.   In a written statement, Kaye Scholer said, &quot;Thissettlement includes nonmonetary conditions that will notadversely affect the firm's ability to continue itspractice.&quot; The statement also emphasized that all charges arebeing dropped against the firm and the three partners withoutany admission of any wrongdoing.   The suit was the biggest professional-liability actionever brought by the OTS, and it involved the most expensiveand heavily publicized Sandamp;L failure ever, that of LincolnSavings, of Irvine, Calif. Charles H. Keating Jr., one-timechairman of Lincoln parent American Continental Corp., wasconvicted of securities fraud in state court in Californialast year. He also faces wider federal bank fraud charges.   The OTS charged that the law firm &quot;aided and abettedregulatory violations by Lincoln&quot; by not disclosing improperunderwriting of Lincoln's loans and securities issues. Thegovernment also claimed that Kaye Scholer partners knew thatLincoln was backdating key documents and purging its files ofdamaging information but that it didn't alert the regulators.Kaye Scholer earned $13 million representing Lincoln and itsparent company between 1985 and 1989, the year Lincoln wasseized by the government.   Last Monday, when the suit was filed, Kaye Scholervehemently denied the charges, saying its duty under anadversary system of justice had been to defend its client asvigorously as possible, not to report its client's misdeedsto authorities.   Gary Lynch, the former chief of enforcement for theSecurities and Exchange Commission who is defending KayeScholer, said at the time that the thrift office'sallegations threatened to alter the relationship betweenlawyers and clients. Mr. Lynch said that the government knewthat Lincoln was engaged in certain actions, such asbackdating files, by the time the law firm was retained. &quot;Weweren't hiding anything from them,&quot; he said last week. &quot;Wewere trying to marshal their best arguments.&quot;   The effort to freeze Kaye Scholer's assets put the legalcommunity on edge. Under the 1989 Sandamp;L bailout law, thriftregulators gained the authority to freeze assets in suchcases to ensure that it can recoup taxpayer losses if it issuccessful in court. But members of established law firmssuch as Kaye Scholer didn't think such a freeze would beapplied to them, since such firms aren't considered likely toevade paying damages.   Some partners at Kaye Scholer opposed settling the OTSsuit, while others wanted to find the quickest reliefpossible from restrictions that seemed to threaten theviability of the 75-year-old law firm. Concerns about theasset freeze, and its potential for coercing law firms tosettle charges lest they be driven out of business, echoedcomplaints in the financial community several years ago whensimilar freezes were threatened or imposed insecurities-fraud and racketeering suits.   The freeze represented an escalation of the government'swar against alleged Sandamp;L fraud by advisers to failed thrifts.Last year, the Resolution Trust Corp. sued Jones, Day, Reavisandamp; Pogue, a Cleveland law firm, seeking $50 million for lossesit said stemmed from its work for Lincoln. But no assetfreeze was sought.   The Kaye Scholer settlement was negotiated by Mr. Lynch ofDavis Polk andamp; Wardwell and Bernard Nussbaum of Wachtell,Lipton, Rosen andamp; Katz, representing Kaye Scholer, and HarrisWeinstein, chief counsel of the OTS, along with other lawyersrepresenting the government. The deal was unveiled late lastnight by the OTS in Washington.   In one unusual provision, as described in the OTS'swritten announcement, Kaye Scholer agreed to designate &quot;abanking partner with at least 10 years' banking-lawexperience as the partner in charge in situations where KayeScholer provides significant representation to an insureddepositary institution.&quot; The purpose, the statement said, isto make sure Kaye Scholer doesn't knowingly misrepresentfacts or omit material information in communications withbanking or thrift regulators.   Kaye Scholer's first payment, of $25 million, is due onMarch 31. Thereafter, a payment of $4 million will be due onDec. 15 of each year from 1993 through 1996. Interest willaccrue on the unpaid balance.   T. Timothy Ryan, the director of the Office of ThriftSupervision, called the settlement &quot;unprecedented&quot; in sizeand scope. The $41 million payment is the largest the OTS haswon against a law firm, he said.   In setting the restitution, Mr. Ryan said the thegovernment sought a figure that reflected the gravity of thecharges yet recognized the ability to pay. &quot;It was not ourdesire to close down the firm,&quot; said Stuart Gerson, theassistant attorney general in the Justice Department's civildivision.   He also pointed out that the restitution is twice what thefirm had offered prior to the formal filing of charges. &quot;Wehave the relief which we have sought,&quot; Mr. Ryan said.   ---   Kenneth H.
