The arbitrager's downfall, and the rest of Wall Street's insider-trading scandals, have spurred an unexpected recruiting bonanza for the Securities and Exchange Commission. Despite low salaries and Spartan working conditions, the SEC says the number of applications received from lawyers has surged in the past few months. And the increased interest is allowing the agency, which often has trouble attracting first-rate lawyers, to be more selective in its hiring.    The &quot;high-profile&quot; SEC now looks &quot;interesting and exciting&quot; to many law students, says Robert H. Mundheim, dean of the law school at the University of Pennsylvania.    Already this year, the SEC's Washington headquarters has received more than 700 resumes, roughly double the average rate for 1986, when it received 1,400 applications. That in turn was double the 700 resumes received in 1985 -- a rise the agency attributes in part to its May 1986 charges against Dennis B. Levine, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. investment banker, the first charges in the still-unfolding insider-trading scandals.    The increased interest hasn't been fueled only by Mr. Boesky and friends. The SEC, which plans to increase staffing substantially over the next year, has been running recruiting advertisements in law journals. But SEC officials say the insider-trading scandals have been the main reason for the surge in applicants.    So far, the officials say, no applicants have told SEC interviewers that they want to &quot;bag an Ivan Boesky,&quot; as the New York Law Journal recently described the surge of interest in the agency. But applicants do &quot;specifically indicate the insider actions have sparked their interest,&quot; says Kathleen A. Warwick, head of the SEC's large New York regional office, where applications in the six months ended in February more than doubled from the year-earlier period.    William R. McLucas, an SEC associate enforcement director who interviews many prospects, says the idea of representing &quot;the 'white-hat' position is coming back in vogue.&quot;    SEC officials say it's too early to tell whether the heightened interest in the agency will produce any dramatic changes in its staffing. As in the past, they say, the government's low pay makes it hard to attract the most talented lawyers and fuels frequent turnover.    The agency's base salary for a new lawyer is $27,172, slightly more for those with experience such as clerking for a judge. That's less than half the $65,000 or more that some big law firms pay starting lawyers. In fact, SEC chairman John Shad noted at a recent congressional hearing that his own $82,500 salary is less than his daughter, a year out of law school, is making at a New York firm.    Still, officials say, the agency's increased appeal makes the hiring outlook more promising than in the past. Many of the new resumes are from top law-school students, Mr. McLucas says. &quot;We're seeing a greater number of people you'd really want to hire.&quot; As a result, the SEC is likely to hire more people right out of law school.    The SEC has always relied heavily on new lawyers, because it can hire them at lower pay and for a longer term than experienced attorneys. &quot;The start-up time is longer&quot; for recent law-school graduates than for experienced lawyers, Mr. McLucas says. &quot;But they might have more potential because they'd be here longer.&quot;    Lawyers hired by the SEC often get to assume more responsibility faster than they would at a private firm. Says Gary Sundick, an assistant director in the enforcement division, &quot;It's not atypical for a person a couple years out of school to be conducting an (SEC) inquiry, when the person on the other side is a partner who I guarantee isn't just two years out of school.&quot;    But even the enforcement division in the agency's Washington office, which handles the big insider-trading cases, spends less than 20% of its time on such cases, officials say; the rest of the time is spent on more routine matters like broker fraud, unsound accounting and stock-loan abuse. Miss Warwick says applicants know they won't just be &quot;going out playing cops and robbers.&quot;    Even work on the insider-trading cases often isn't glamorous. &quot;Looking at trading runs (stock-trading printouts) in insider cases may sound exciting in the press,&quot; says Mr. McLucas. &quot;But most of the work is fairly routine.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
