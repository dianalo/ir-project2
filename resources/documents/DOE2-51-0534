<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-51-0534 </DOCNO><TEXT>Laser spectroscopy is discussed as a source of information about nuclearphysics properties. The quantities measured in such an experiment areatomic physics properties, namely the isotope shift and the hyperfinestructure of the optical fluorescence spectra in the visible wavelengthband. Nuclear physics information describing properties of the groundstate and isomeric states of a nucleus can be extracted from these data,namely nuclear magnetic dipole moments, nuclear electric quadrupole moments,nuclear spins and the changes of the mean square charge radii betweenisotopes. Some recent results are reported as examples. The method ofcollinear fast-atomic-beam spectroscopy using the isotopically pure beamsof on-line mass-separators and a very similar technique which has beenproposed to study the hyperfine structure of hydrogen-like ions in thestorage ring for cooled ions, ESR, under construction at GSI, are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
