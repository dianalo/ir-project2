In otherwords, it is arranged that the cooling of a condenser, which is neededat the time of starting a steam turbine, is done by laying out in a condensingturbine geothermal power station a circulating route of the cooling waterwhich returns to the condenser from a cooling water tank into which thecooling water in a circulating water pit is sucked and stored and whichis interlocked with a steam ejector driven by the steam from the geothermalwell, and a steam turbine is started during the time until the coolingwater tank becomes empty. Thus, because of its self-contained starting,no facility such as starting transformer, etc. is needed for receivingelectric power from the outside, consequently the installation cost canbe reduced.
