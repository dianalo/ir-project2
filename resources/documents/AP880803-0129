At 2 a.m. HST Tuesday (2 a.m. EDT Wednesday), the storm was1,000 miles east southeast of Honolulu, moving west at 14 mph, saidHans Rosendal, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service here.   Clarence Lee, lead National Weather Service forecaster inHonolulu, said Fabio ``is now a very potent and dangeroushurricane,'' accompanied by damaging winds, destructive waves andtorrential rain.   ``This is one of the strongest hurricanes in the area in quite awhile,'' Rosendal said.   Fabio's maximum sustained winds were estimated near 145 mph. Thestorm was expected to continue moving west at 14 mph for the next24 hours with little change in strength, Rosendal said.   If the storm remained on its present course and speed, thecenter would pass about 50 miles south of Hawaii Island on Friday,according to the weather service.   The last major storm to hit Hawaii was Hurricane Iwa, whichbrushed the island of Oahu and roared over the top of Kauai withwinds up to 117 mph in November 1982, causing $234 million damage.</TEXT></DOC>
