Frank Haile Jr., 58, a pilot for 20 years, has flown around theworld in a single-engine plane three times. He returned to Dallas onThursday to receive a warm welcome from about 15 family members andfriends.   He promptly vowed to ``never leave the U.S. again.''   ``When you leave the United States, you're very vulnerable,''said Haile, owner and president of a Dallas-based engineering firm.``If you break a rule, you have no rights. They just lock you up.''   Haile's Beechcraft Bonanza V-35B was intercepted June 16 byIndian Air Force planes and forced to land after the planes believedhe had strayed into restricted air space near the India-Pakistanborder.   He and seven associates were flying in four planes from NewDehli, India, to Bahrain.   Dr. Howard Wisner, another of the pilots, said that because ofbad weather, the group had to adjust its course, which took theplanes ``skirting down the edge of the restricted area'' about 350miles northwest of Bombay.   Wisner, 62, said he heard Haile's co-pilot, Carson Gilmer ofRocksprings, say, ``A MiG fighter just passed so close it almosttook the paint off my plane.''   Wisner said he then heard the Indian pilot radio Gilmer and twoWest Germans in a second plane to land or ``you'll have theconsequences.''   Wisner's plane and another managed to escape while the MiG pilotsconcentrated on the two other aircraft.   Haile said the planes were forced down at an Indian air forcebase, where the base commander accused them of spying.   ``We were kept in what was like a hotel room'' in the desert townof Bhuj, which Haile said was a poor but nice hamlet that improvedafter sundown when the ``flies would all go away.''   He said after countless interrogations, authorities were finallyconvinced they were not spies and allowed them to leave June 27.   ``When this is all over, I just want to be normal,'' said Haile'swife, Joan. ``I just want to relax.''</TEXT></DOC>
