This is a topic that bedevils me.andP;  The more I know, the moreconflicting opinions I have.andP;  We're not going to debate either interfaces orcopyrights, but the notion of intellectual property on a more general basis.andM;There arc several points I want to start off with, then we'll have adiscussion.andM;The first point - software libraries - came up yesterday at the Sovietroundtable and when I was in the Soviet Union.andP;  People in various Sovietinstitutes and factories write software and send it to the library.andP;  Anybodycan reuse it.andP;  But nobody does, because there's nobody to tell them what's inthe library and to promote its value.andP;  There's no incentive for this stuff tobe reused.andP;  This is a generalization, but most of the applications in theSoviet Union are written once and then written again separately all over theplace.andM;It's the other end of the spectrum from what we're trying to do withobject-oriented programming: Reuse configurable applications and so forth.andO;It's my thesis the notion of intellectual property and the incentivesattached to it will give life, to reusable code.andM;The second question is: To bring those incentives to bear  lo you really needto have software as intellectual property or is software, as Jim Manzi said,merely a service?andM;Should you get paid for telling people what software might be available?andO;Should you get paid for training people to use software? For helping toinstall it? For configuring applications tailored to customer needs? Cansoftware be free? Should you charge for the attendant services?andM;With these things in mind I'd like to open up the panel.andP;  But before weaddress the general questions, Ann Winblad is a venture capitalist and thisindustry was in large part created by venture capital.andP;  I'd like yourfeelings on what you look for in terms of intellectual property protectionand potential intellectual property liabilities when you  decide whether tofund a  company.andM;Ann Winblad, Hummer Winblad Venture Partners: A while ago it seemed thatpeople with the most impact on business plans were accountants.andP;  Then we hadspreadsheets so all that changed.andP;  From the business plans I look at today,it seems clear the people with the most impact are lawyers.andM;One good thing about the business plans we see is that a majority of peoplewith software companies claim their technologies are patentable.andP;  I'm notsaying that patents are a good idea.andP;  But people who indicate they  canpatent their technologies at least have investigated whether they own thetechnology, which is the biggest issue for venture, capitalists.andM;John Warnock made the point about people being lax in the early stages oftheir  companies - especially companies spawned by programmers - about wherethe software came from.andP;  Did they use consultants? Did they sign agreementswith the consultants to et assignments of copyrights or the intellectualownership of the software itself?andM;Copyrights are expensive.andP;  A lot of companies spend $50,000 to patentsomething and get a patent that is not protectable.andP;  A patent does notguarantee you can protect yourself, because more than 50 percent of thepatents cannot be held up in court.andM;In thinking about this panel I polled a bunch of lawyers.andP;  When I asked themabout intellectual property issues they said, &quot;That's the biggest growthsegment for the whole legal industry.&quot; This is pretty frightening.andM;[laughter]andM;I asked what their strategies are.andP;  They said one of their key strategies isif they have a client who is going to sue for a patent violation, they findlittle companies who potentially have violated the patents.andP;  They actuallyget some kind of tidal wave of winning cases.andP;  It's a big issue for venturecapitalists who are trying to protect small companies during their earlygrowth from the lawyers themselves.andP;  Let alone trying to understand thepatent issues that arise.andM;The last issue of concern is the international area.andP;  Yesterday we polled theaudience to find out which companies generate more than 50 percent of theirrevenues internationally.andP;  Many small software companies are launchingproducts internationally.andP;  If we think the patent and intellectual propertylaws are confusing and go backward and forward in how they're applied in theUS, they're even more of a nightmare internationally.andM;It's not cut-and-dried how we can use intellectual property protection withsoftware companies at au.andM;Dyson: Do you care that they should own it or simply that someone else shouldnot? Is it okay if their stuff is public domain and they just do stuff withit?andM;Winblad: I care that they can sell it, and that they can continue selling it.andO;From my own experience as a software entrepreneur, I had a consultant -actually a dealer-work with my company in defining the specifications of oneof our applications.andP;  We had a contract saying the person was a consultantand helped us.andP;  This person thought it was really great helping this smallsoftware company and didn't think of it as an intellectual experience untilwe sold the company for $15 million.andM;At that point the consultant completely lost his memory and sued us for usingthose specifications in all sorts of applications that the contract didn'tindicate.andM;The key issue is that aU the way along the line, especially in the earlystages, whoever is paying attention to this has to pay very close attentionbecause it doesn't become an issue until you're successful.andP;  You're askingme, &quot;Do I care if they own it?&quot; I care a lot if they own it, because it's notgoing to be known until they become successful.andM;Dyson: Thank you.andM;John Warnock, Adobe: When we started as a company, we had a breakthrough intechnology having to do with fonts.andP;  We made a direct decision to taketrade-secret protection as opposed to patent protection.andP;  I'm very happy wedid that.andM;A patent gets published.andP;  Almost immediately, people who are interested willstart to work around the patent.andP;  Unless a small company gets a very broadpatent, I suggest that in early stages it rely on trade-secret protectioninstead of patent protection.andP;  As you become a big, successful company, thenpatent protection is more appropriate.andP;  We now go after patents veryaggressively because if we get into litigation, we have enough money to dealwith it.andP;  A small company just doesn't have enough money to do that.andP;  I'm nota lawyer, but I have gained some experience here.andM;Dyson: You know we have no lawyers on this panel.andP;  Robert E Berland, IBM.andP;  Wetalked briefly about trade-secret and about patent protections.andP;  We ought tofocus on copyright.andP;  IBM did a major study in 1969 as to which way we wantedto go as the industry &quot;unbundled.&quot; We decided copyright had merit for all ofus.andP;  Trade-secret protection has certain problems.andP;  If the information getsout, you lose it.andP;  Patent protection, as John highlighted, is a problembecause it takes so long to get a patent and there can be arguments over it.andM;The power of copyright is the whole history of US copyright laws, literaryworks, et cetera.andP;  You can not copyright ideas.andP;  You are copyrighting theirexpression.andP;  IBM and many software companies have found copyright a very goodvehicle.andP;  Warnock: I concur.andP;  Copyright is assumed to be one of the bestlegal protections we have.andM;Dyson: Unfortunately its application is somewhat unclear.andM;Warnock: That's tight.andM;Berland: Can I comment on that?andM;Dyson: Yes.andP;  People who want to comment come up to the mike.andP;  Bob, justbriefly follow up and then it's Larry's turn.andP;  Berland: Copyright is not asunclear as the industry has made noise about it being.andP;  When you get down tothe legal issues and the lawyers, it's not that unclear.andP;  The real issue isthe European Economic Community and those who want to break copyright andchange the whole concept.andP;  This is a policy issue that has nothing to do withthe law.andM;Dyson: Okay.andP;  Larry?andM;Lawrence G. Tesler, Apple Computer.andP;  I'm concerned about John's statementabout trade secrets.andP;  Traditionally that has been the best thing for a smallcompany.andP;  Reverse engineering however is the defeat of trade secrets, andthere's no protection against that.andP;  In the international-trade negotiationsand negotiations on intellectual-property rules, the Japanese government hastaken the stance that reverse engineering should be protected.andP;  Technologycould he developed that makes reverse engineering take less and less time forless and less cost.andP;  With that loophole, people who would rather copy thaninnovate will exploit that technique.andP;  So trade secrets may become lessuseful.andM;Dyson: The technology in fact is changing rapidly.andP;  It's going to make a lotof these questions very different, because you can reverse engineer stuff andmake it look quite different.andP;  How does copyright apply when neither the codenor the interface is the same, et cetera?andM;Enzo Torresi, NetFRAME: Bob, may I speak to that?andM;Berland: Go ahead.andM;Torresi: There is an interesting situation now which the US and Europeansoftware industries can do something about.andP;  There has been action withregard to the EEC and 1992 to equalize copyright-protection laws.andP;  The EEC istaking account of these laws as they relate to international property rights.andM;US copyright laws at the moment are almost as tight as you can get.andP;  There'svery little exception to the definition of copyright and what can becopyrighted as far as ideas are concerned.andP;  There are two activities going onto lessen copyright protection.andP;  One is about re-engineering and the other isthe rather loose definition of interface.andM;What's wanted through re engineering is an ability to get at any software,copyrighted or not, and to identify interface points, published or otherwise.andO;You need to re engineer in some cases to get at those interface points.andP;  Whatit will do is put a bull in a china shop.andP;  Anyone who is allowed to do thatthrough that process can probably plagiarize protected stuff and argue itthrough the courts.andM;At the moment, a lot of people are arguing the point.andP;  An organization inEurope called Sage has about 170-odd members who are saying, &quot;No, keep copyprotection absolute and allow people who own intellectual property the rightto license people to use it.&quot; In other words, releasing copyright protectionthrough licensing of that technology, but keeping it absolute.andM;The other side is called ISIS and says - they don't actually say this butthey imply it - &quot;Let me get at the technology by some other means so that Ican take advantage.&quot; This is really an open debate.andM;I'm very, very concerned that by loosening the copyright-protection laws,you're going to drive a hole in the whole process of protecting someone'sability to innovate and to create technology.andP;  It's a real threat.andP;  If youknow people you can write to and express your point of view - which I hope ismy point of view - please do so.andP;  The Computer Services Association isleading this and I'm sure they will see my point of view, certainly as itrelates to the software industry.andM;Dyson: Thank you.andP;  Bob, did you have a short Berland: He did it beautifully -Dyson: - or are you just looking at me?andM;David Liddle, Metaphor Computer Systems: No, I was just watching.andM;Dyson: Harry Reinstein.andP;  You heard him earlier.andM;Harry Reinstein, Aion: And will again I imagine.andP;  First of all, the laws arenot being uniformly interpreted.andP;  The situation is extremely fluid anddifficult right now.andP;  As a general comment, I want to remind everybody thatthe intellectual-Property laws in this country were not established toguarantee profit to companies that invent things.andP;  They were established tofoster intellectual creativity.andP;  This is an industry that has enormousintellectual creativity - with or without the laws - but the laws arecritical.andM;Esther's already proposed this, but I would like to propose a three-statementresolution and have the panel comment.andM;Dyson: And then we'll vote.andM;Reinstein: I'd love to.andP;  One: Interfaces - certainly all public or exposedinterfaces - are not protectable.andP;  Interfaces are points of competitiveentry.andP;  This would make it easy for the courts to interpret.andM;Dyson: Programming interfaces or also visual interfaces?andM;Reinstein: All except for the artistic elements.andP;  If you have Mickey Mousedancing on the screen pointing out where your curser goes, no.andP;  Anyone shouldhave the tight to retain copyright for Mickey Mouse, but the idea of pointingout where a cursor is should not be protectable.andM;By the way, it has gone so far that a company that attempted to make a gamein which a runner knocked over rather than jumped hurdles if the game wasn'tplayed correctly was found to be in violation of intellectual-property rightsheld by another company.andP;  This company had managed to copyright the idea ofone object on a computer screen hitting another and knocking it over.andP;  Thisis ludicrous but that's how the courts found it.andM;Point Two: Code is protected.andP;  You can copyright what you've written.andP;  Youcan own it and protect it.andM;Point 3: legislation, not yet written, win protect the use of your code,specifically prohibiting reverse engineering and other automatic ways inwhich one can decompile, restructure and recompile and thereby build what youhave.andM;Dyson: That means that I can copy your interface as long as I write my codeindependentlyandM;Reinstein: Absolutely.andM;Dyson: - and don't do it automatically?andM;Reinstein: Of course you don't use my keys to reverse engineer.andP;  You use justthe interface and decide on your own way to do it.andM;Dave Winer, Userland Software: What's your definition of a derivative?andM;Reinstein: A  derivative work in terms of code is always one in which code isimplanted in it.andP;  We're not talking about a derivative work in that case;we're talking about using the graphic interface or the concept of a cursor orwhatever.andP;  All derivative works based on interfaces would be legal becausethe interface would be unprotected.andP;  That's how this industry's grown.andP;  Ifyou keep in mind that the systems of our industry are getting bigger, then wehave to have something like this in place.andM;We, are unlike the true creative industry of literature.andP;  When someone buys abook, it doesn't mean they'll never buy another one.andP;  Or it doesn't meanthey'll buy only books with those characters and those plots.andP;  But whensomeone buys a database manager they may well not buy another.andP;  We have avery different model in this industry, and we've got to allow the competitionat the interface point.andM;Dyson: Just one  question.andP;  What is it that you sell? From anintellectual-property perspective?andM;Reinstein: Because we're basically a mainframe company, we license softwarethat permits the development of applications.andP;  if someone  else built exactlyto our interfaces we would not stop him.andM;Dyson: In that case, what you would be selling in the end would be theservice and support or the souffle on top?andM;Reinstein: What we really sell is not the current property but the promisethere will be another one within nine to twelve months, new versions, supportand training.andP;  That's how we differentiate ourselves.andP;  Somebody else  couldtake any current unit and try to replicate it but they would be behind usbecause we're building more...andM;Dyson: So your ready and open for souffles?andM;[Laughter]andM;Liddle: Why the hell is it that writing code, which I've spent a lot of mylife doing, is such a noble pursuit we protect it, while defining aninterface is a frivolous and juvenile one so anybody ought to be able to useit?andM;[Applause]andM;That's hard.andP;  People have been writing code for longer and it's notcocktail-party conversation.andP;  You can't see it on a TV commercial so it's notvery interesting.andP;  It's easy not to worry about because most people don'tknow that if they only had that code they could do something else valuablewith it.andM;But that doesn't mean it's more honest toil to produce the code just becauseit's more arcane.andP;  The design of interfaces not just user interfaces by anymeans - is actually a subtle and difficult art.andP;  As Metcalfe said aboutEthernet and as John Warnock said, &quot;These two sets of intellectual propertiesare valuable because they can be reused and recycled.&quot;andM;I have a big problem with this idea that that's not in and of itselflegitimate intellectual property.andP;  Many interfaces are designed for otherpeople to use and share.andP;  UNIX is a classic case.andP;  Other interfaces areguarded because they're competitively better.andP;  There's nothing wrong withdesigning an interface better than somebody else and taking the risk ofkeeping that private.andM;I don't mean to get quite so emotional about this, but it seems to me wereally have hardening of the arteries when it comes to talking about makingsharp distinctions in designs that should be open and those that should beclosed.andP;  If it's intellectual property, you should decide how you want totreat it.andM;[Applause]andM;Warnock: I agree with Dave.andP;  The market takes care of the fact that peoplekeep their interfaces closed.andP;  We did a portion of Postscript as an openinterface; it's useful to the outside world and its market acceptance isbecause of that openness.andP;  If somebody builds something proprietary they getwhat they deserve if they're trying to reach a broad audience.andP;  The marketwill take advantage of it, but you don't want the intellectual property lawsto make that determination for you.andM;Dyson: Larry is a case in point of someone who kept something closed andnonetheless managed to be successful with it through some trials andtribulations.andM;Tesler.andP;  Yeah.andP;  I'm agreeing with this line of thought.andP;  A lot of people inthe industry think the confusion in the last few years is not because peoplesuddenly are trying to protect their property but because some things havechanged.andP;  It used to be you had to say &quot;patent pending&quot; on something you weretrying to patent.andP;  Until a few months ago you had to put a copyright noticeon something you wanted to copyright.andM;Over the last few years the legal system has changed.andP;  First you didn't haveto say &quot;patent pending&quot; on the theory you are clueing competitors who mightwork around it if they knew you were going to patent it.andP;  A few months ago wedropped the requirement for a copyright fee.andP;  This makes a lot more money forlawyers, but I don't see that it's helped the industry.andP;  When people come outwith new products, they should make it clear what they're protecting, whatthey're not protecting, what they're standardizing and so on.andM;That's something we can do despite the fact the legal system doesn't want toencourage that because it will reduce the number of lawsuits quite a bit.andM;Dyson: The legal system at this point does encourage us to do it, especiallyif you believe as Bob does that copyright is fairly stringent.andP;  Then itbecomes a business decision.andP;  Bob? Then we'll take that vote.andM;Berland: This question of user interface is interesting.andP;  Everybody who wantsto make it available gives the example of somebody jumping over a littlething in a game.andP;  By the way, it's not the idea they can be copyrighted, onlythe expression.andP;  Or they talk about the wastebasket.andP;  What drove me to focuson this is that of the many applications written by those in this room, 80percent of the work was done on the user interface.andP;  That's what the usersees.andM;The analogy that convinced me of the importance of this is the game ofMonopoly.andP;  Everybody agrees the game should be copyrighted.andP;  Then it's put iton the screen as a computer game.andP;  All of a sudden it should be given away toeverybody? The danger in this is the people who want to give this away or getit for free take it in the narrow sense.andP;  The danger is in a broad sense.andP;  Itcould absolutely impact the hell out of somebody who's spent all his work,energy, time and creativity on something.andM;Robert Metcalfe, 3Com: Very provocative question.andP;  You got a lot of peopleemotional.andP;  I'm emotional about one of Harry's throw-away comments.andP;  Youdistinguish between the purpose of the law to protect creativity versusprofit.andM;Reinstein: It's true.andP;  It's right in the Constitution.andM;Metcalfe: It can't be.andM;Reinstein: It is.andM;Metcalfe: No, it isn't true.andP;  There's nothing true about the law.andM;[Laughter]andM;That's like saying the purpose of common law is to protect the notion that aperson's house is his home, but does not actually guarantee that he can livethere.andP;  Without profit, who is going to generate all these ideas, and who isgoing to work on all this software?andM;Reinstein: Who has for 30 years?andM;Dyson: I'd like to say it's not just a question of who's going to do thecreative stuff.andP;  It's also a question of who's going to take that stuff anddocument it, sell it, advertise it, support it and make sure somebody hangsaround to do the second release, which is usually more boring than doing thefirst?andM;Reinstein: The comment about the law derives from Article VIII of theConstitution.andP;  It is generally held by people far better than I atunderstanding law that the basis of it was to foster and encourage thecreative arts, which is specifically what it says, not to guarantee a returnfrom hard effort.andP;  There are lots of hard efforts in this world.andP;  People whoinvent mathematical algorithms work really hard at them but they can'tprotect them, et cetera, et cetera.andP;  There's nothing that says if you workhard, you get to own it.andM;If I had decided to protect the 370 architecture, very few industries - likethe automobile industry - would have been able to come into it in the waythey have.andP;  If IBM had chosen to do other things inside its systems - whichit hasn't and I'm tremendously thankful for that - then the indicators wouldbe different.andP;  There'd be no 1-2-3 if Software Arts had decided to protecttheir product.andM;Dyson: If they'd protected the concept.andM;Metcalfe: The unfortunate part of software is that it is a very differenttechnology from any other addressed by intellectual-property laws.andP;  Softwareformed equal expression; it's very difficult to separate an interface fromthe concept behind it.andP;  That's the problem you have to wrestle with.andM;Liddle: These are two important but very different topics.andP;  One is the publicpolicy question about whether it would have been good for the 370 instructionset to have been intensely protected.andP;  The second point is whether theintellectual-Property laws associated with entertainment are the rightvehicles for protecting other kinds of intellectual property.andM;I don't think anyone here would argue they're entitled to succeed, althoughBob Berland makes the point that it's quite adequate in many cases to hesatisfied with that.andP;  Okay? I don't think you're intentionally arguing thathaving it loose and shaky is a good thing because that allows growth and - Reinstein: You're right.andP;  It's two issues.andP;  I'll go even further becausethat...andM;Liddle: No.andP;  I will take a position to see what people say, &quot;I don't thinkthe Monopoly board should have been opened,&quot; but there are other aspects I amwilling to back off on.andP;  It's a critical, fundamental issue and we need toaddress it seriously as an industry.andM;Dyson: Any of you guys standing up here, do you have a very short comment tomake before we take this vote or shall we go ahead and - Okay.andP;  let's see,all exposed interfaces are public domain.andP;  Who thinks that should be thecase?andM;[Show of hands]andM;Harry, you've got ten guys on your side.andP;  That's about it.andM;Reinstein: No.andP;  It's at least 15.andM;[Laughter]andM;Dyson: Okay.andP;  The code is protectable?andM;[Show of hands]andM;Looks something like 80 percent.andP;  And the use of code for reverse engineeringis forbidden?andM;[Show of hands]andM;Okay.andP;  Eighty percent again.andP;  How many think program interfaces should beopen even if you can copyright visual interfaces and these are hard things todefine?andM;[Show of hands]andM;Okay.andP;  A few more in favor of open program interfaces but it's still - Idon't know - right-wing, left-wing, whatever.andP;  Okay.andP;  I see Adele Goldberg.andO;I want to switch because we are not going to come to a conclusion here.andM;Torresi: We just have to.andM;Dyson: Okay.andP;  But we haven't changed Harry's mind, have we? Reinstein: No.andM;Dyson: No.andP;  We're not going to come to a conclusion here.andP;  The numbers mayhave it, but the argument continues.andP;  Adele Goldberg, I don't know if youwere going to ask or talk about this point but since you sell objectlibraries, I'm curious about what their intellectual-Property implicationsare.andM;Adele Goldberg, ParkPlace Systems: We do sell object libraries, and wecopyright all of our implementation.andP;  The hard work in doing object-oirientedtechnology is in the interface design.andP;  All of our time and effort goes intothose designs.andP;  The idea that those designs would be free, without usdeciding which ones would be appropriately leveraged, would mean we'd be outof that part of our business very quickly.andP;  The implementation of an objectis trite.andM;Dyson: Let me follow up.andP;  If somebody buys your object library set, takesyour objects, creates derivative works on them and then resells them in theirprograms and so forth and so on, do they pay you a royalty?andM;Goldberg.- We license them to do that in the sense that you would buy aprocedure library.andP;  In procedural-oriented programs you buy the software withcertain rights to reuse.andP;  In some cases you're paying a run-time; in othercases you don't.andP;  But we make that decision.andP;  It's not something you justmake assumptions about.andP;  We're experts at object-oriented designs.andP;  A lot ofpeople are copying the designs of the class hierarchies of the class names inother languages.andP;  The class names are the message interfaces - all of whichare very carefully designed.andP;  They do not have a legal right to do thatcopying.andM;Dyson: Do you have complex accounting problems?andM;Goldberg.- No.andM;Dyson: No? People just report to you they had this quarter or how?andM;Goldberg.- With respect to the people who are honest, which is primarily howyou operate your business, we don't have any problems.andP;  There are people whomake the bad mistake of copying the object designs from one language toanother.andP;  Some of those implementations don't take cultural aspects intoaccount and are ugly.andP;  They should be redesigned.andM;As a small company, we don't have the wherewithal to chase around enforcingand litigating with everybody.andP;  People will copy, but in the scheme of thingsit doesn't cost us that much.andP;  Our expertise happens to be in our capabilityto be good designers.andM;Dyson: Thanks.andP;  What we're going to do is take all these questions quickly soyour question was Goldberg: My question follows from that last statement.andO;The one piece of intellectual property we don't talk about very much is tiedto the human beings in our companies.andP;  We're software vendors and softwarecompanies.andP;  We all know that in addition to the marketing, management andproduct quality issues, investors look at who will do the designs and theimplementation.andM;So human beings are an intellectual property.andP;  Our obligation as employers tothose human beings is to make sure they understand what it is they can't gorunning around Silicon Valley sharing with every other company.andM;Dyson: Any quick answers?andM;Berland: There are two parts to the answer: One is an employment contract;two is education.andM;Goldberg: If I could just comment on the employment contract.andM;Berland: And the third is keeping your employees very happy.andM;Goldberg: The employee contract protects the company against the employee,not vice versa.andP;  There's a two-way street here.andP;  I've had an enormous amountof my time wasted by other people's litigation.andP;  Nobody's protecting me fromthat and it bothers me.andM;Fred M. Gibbons, Software Publishing.andP;  I wanted to address the patent issues.andO;We ought to look at them from the point of view of what the law should berather than what it is.andM;The patent system is fundamentally flawed and counterproductive.andP;  Astechnology evolves there comes a point where an idea occurs to hundreds ofpeople within a couple of years.andP;  The first person who happens to have theresources to get it together, to document that and to file the patentapplication ends up with the right to sue other people.andM;A case in point is the patent on a computer with a hinge display that foldsdown over the keyboard.andP;  I bet 500 people were going to have that idea as thetechnology evolved to the point where you could build computers in that form.andO;The great majority of patents really fail the test of non-obviousness.andM;Dyson: As Ann pointed out, simply having a patent does not necessarily meanthat it's going to hold up in court.andP;  Second, you can describe a lot ofinventions in much broader terms than the patent it actually covers.andP;  Thatmay be the case in many of these cases; in some it's not.andP;  The test is: Doesit seem obvious once you hear it?andM;[Laughter]andM;Like the page numbers.andM;[Applause]andM;Warnock: There are companies that buy patents and litigate just on ownership.andO;The patent law should be changed so that you have a two-year period to turnthe patent into a product.andP;  As long as you have that product you haveprotection.andP;  If you don't use it, you lose it.andM;Dyson: How many in favor of that?andM;[Applause and show of hands] Torresi: Time unspecified.andP;  Don't say two years.andM;Dyson: Okay.andP;  There are some in favor of it, with maybe a few reservations orqualifications.andP;  Gib?andM;Gib Hoxie, Arthur D. Little: As a consultant I'm painfully aware of whatlittle value employers put on the ideas themselves.andP;  You talk as if they'rean important intellectual asset.andP;  Yet when we contribute an idea to a clientit's worth only our hourly fee.andM;It's important to understand it isn't the idea, it's the execution or theexpression that is more important.andP;  The most important thing said on thepanel was by Ann Winblad who said she looks to the ability of the company tomarket and deliver a quality product to the customer.andP;  The other thing thatfrustrates me about the way the panel has addressed this issue is its failureto distinguish between unauthorized copying of a product by customers asopposed to unauthorized copying by competitors.andP;  These are two separateissues.andM;Dyson: That is duplication versus derivative works, and this is strictlyderivative works here.andP;  I don't think anybody was talking about flat-outduplication.andM;Hoxie: I favor the idea that we give up this internecine warfare to protectour intellectual copyright and get into tools.andP;  The successful companies arethe ones that execute - although not necessarily innovate - well.andM;Dyson: If you'll fire all the lawyers we'll do that.andM;Dave Mandelkern, VI.andP;  Corporation: I want to get back to the copyright issuebecause the same things will crop up with the ancillary issues in the future.andO;The law is clear: It's the expression of the idea that's protected, not theidea itself.andM;If it's the wastebasket or Monopoly, that's protectable.andP;  The concept of apull-down menu is not protectable because it's a concept.andP;  One companyshouldn't have a lock on good techniques for user interfaces.andP;  The same istrue with object libraries.andP;  The content of your object is protectable andthe implementation may be protectable.andP;  The fact that you have a class oflibraries that interact with each other is not protectable.andP;  That's got to bean open interface so that other people can build compatible systems.andP;  Youcan't have islands of protection that are islands unto themselves.andP;  That'sbad for the industry.andM;Dyson: Thank you.andM;Tesler.andP;  When we were talking about ideas not being protectable, that was bycopyright; some ideas - mechanisms for performing things - are protectable bypatent.andM;Dyson: Thank you all very much.andP;  I have plans to design and copyright aprogram that will examine an interface and decide which parts are expressionand which parts are ideas.andP;  Thank you very much.andM;[Applause]</TEXT></DOC>
