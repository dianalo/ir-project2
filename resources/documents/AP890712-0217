Congressional watchdog Public Citizen said the trips costtaxpayers at least $13.5 million. They included one journey to fivecountries by the House Rules Committee, which has no role indrafting legislation.   In another trip, 13 House members and seven staffers went toAustralia for seven days to help celebrate the centennial of thatnation's parliament, according to the report, ``Free FlyingCongress.''   ``There are many valid reasons for members of Congress to travelat taxpayer expense, but at least some of these trips appear to beunjustified excursions,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of theRalph Nader organization.</TEXT><NOTE>End embargoed material.</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some National Rifle Association members aresigning petitions to oust President Bush from the organizationbecause of his decision to ban imports of semiautomatic assaultrifles.   But the White House says Bush, who last Friday permanently bannedimports of 43 styles of the weapons, has no intention of resigninghis lifetime NRA membership.   ``The president's a good, solid member of the NRA, always hasbeen, always will be,'' spokesman B. Jay Cooper said Tuesday.``We've done nothing that goes against the Second Amendment,'' whichensures the right of citizens to keep and bear arms.   Wayne LaPierre, executive director of the NRA Institute forLegislative Action, said ``a lot of people are very upset aboutthis'' because many voted for Bush because of his opposition to guncontrol laws.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Increased concern about violent crime isproducing an unlikely congressional coalition behind a plan to add100,000 officers to police forces across the country by tradingscholarships for service.   The idea behind the Police Corps Act of 1989 is to boost thestrength of state and local police forces by up to 22 percent whilecreating a new brand of college-educated officers to cope withracial tensions, gang warfare and other special challenges.   An unusual group of lawmakers has formed around the bill,including Reps. Barney Frank, D-Mass., and Bob Dornan, R-Calif.   The outspoken, liberal Frank is rarely on the same side of anissue with Dornan, an equally combative conservative. ``People whodisagree on 90 percent of the issues agree on 10 percent,'' Franksaid Tuesday.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   House tax-writers, under orders to find anextra $5.3 billion to reduce the deficit, are casting an eye towardpipe smokers, telephone users, air travelers and lenders.   Those groups would pay more tax under a proposal by Rep. DanRostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and MeansCommittee. But most of the three dozen-plus recommendations that hepresented to the panel Tuesday are highly technical changesaffecting few ordinary taxpayers.   During the budget year that begins Oct. 1, Rostenkowski's planwould produce just the amount of new revenue envisioned under adeficit-reduction agreement between Congress and the Bushadministration.   Although the plan would require various groups to pay more moneyto the federal government, apparently no part of it is a general taxincrease that would be viewed as conflicting with President Bush'spledge to oppose any tax increase.</TEXT><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After pitching his role in the ``MassachusettsMiracle'' during his presidential campaign, Gov. Michael S. Dukakisis winding down his final term trying to draw from a spending wellthat has all but run dry.   The darkest hour is expected Thursday, when Dukakis will announce$500 million in ``deep and painful cuts'' from a budget just enacted.   ``Personally, I regret this,'' he said, ``because Thursday isgoing to be a dark day in the history of this commonwealth, and itis all so unnecessary.''   He said the spending vetoes will lead to thousands of stateemployee layoffs, across-the-board cuts in government and thepossible elimination of some agencies.</TEXT><DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   This month's Iranian presidential electionappears a one-horse race dominated by Parliament Speaker HashemiRafsanjani and if the Tehran media is anything to go by, the resultis a foregone conclusion.   A poll published Tuesday by the radical Abrar daily, which hasbeen critical of Rafsanjani's so-called pragmatist faction in thepast, indicated that 86 percent of Iranians will vote for him in theJuly 28 balloting.   Eleven percent said they would vote for his challenger, formerAgriculture Minister Abbas Sheibani of the Freedom Movement, Iran'stoken opposition party.
