Guillermo Cochez, a spokesman for Panama's Christian DemocraticParty, also quoted President Manuel Solis Palma as saying that anagreement on Panama's political future may be signed this week.   Cochez said the Aug. 12 departure date for Noriega is underconsideration because that is the fifth anniversary of hisaccession as commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces.   Reagan administration officials refused to discuss Cochez'scomments, noting that a government-wide news blackout on thePanamanian issue has been imposed.   But Panama's political future has been the subject of continuingnegotiations between U.S. officials and a variety of Panamanians,both in and out of government.   Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams met Tuesday withPanama's Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, a leader of the anti-Noriegaforces in exile. There was no report on the meeting.   Cochez and Aurelio Barria, a leader of another group opposed toNoriega, spoke to reporters at the National Democratic Institutefor International Affairs, which is affiliated with the DemocraticParty.   The administration, in a policy shift, said last week it is nolonger insisting that Noriega leave Panama and would settle for hisresignation as defense chief as a prelude to a transition todemocratic rule.   Word of the policy shift has angered the Panamanian opposition,which maintains that the country's political future is forPanamanians to decide, not the United States.   ``The U.S. has no right to decide if a Panamanian can stay ornot in the country,'' Barria said.   Cochez said Noriega would be able to maintain control in Panamaif he stays in the country even without a formal title.   Any agreement allowing Noriega to remain on would mean ``treasonagainst the Panamanian people,'' he said.   ``We are completely convinced Noriega is a murderer, we arecompletely convinced he is involved in drugs,'' Cochez said.   Noriega has been indicted by two federal grand juries in Floridaon drug-smuggling charges.</TEXT></DOC>
