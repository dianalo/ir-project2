Vice President George Bush, Rep. Jack Kemp and Sen. Robert Dole are abandoning hope that the arms crisis is a passing storm, and their strategists now are seeking to determine how best to insulate them from damage. The result is an unusually bitter struggle among the three men, with Vice President Bush being sniped at privately by the other two and with the Kemp and Dole camps openly criticizing each other and lunging for early advantage in the struggle for the 1988 nomination.    This political subtheme to the Iran crisis has produced a flurry of activity:    --Mr. Bush came forward and admitted that &quot;mistakes were made,&quot; but this week's disclosures giving details of the close relationship of his staff and the secret Contra arms network seems to drag the vice president closer to the vortex of the storm. Though he remains the front-runner, his one-time advantage -- his ties with Mr. Reagan -- restricts his mobility at a time when he most needs to develop his political persona.    --Mr. Kemp, who first shied away from the controversy in an effort to underline his lack of involvement, now is struggling to wage a counteroffensive. But his pleas for Republicans to stand by the president -- &quot;What more is Ronald Reagan supposed to do?&quot; he asks in an article in Human Events, a conservative weekly -- have lacked fire.    --Mr. Dole may be the man with the most to gain. For much of the early stages of the GOP political marathon he has been considered the third-leading candidate, behind Vice President Bush and Mr. Kemp, but the Iran crisis has propelled the Kansan into the spotlight.    Throughout the crisis, Sen. Dole, always known for his shrewdness in the Machiavellian maneuvers of insider Washington, has used a series of platforms to transform himself into a major figure in the Iran affair without being tarnished by it. There is a sharp contrast between the Robert Dole who, as Republican National Committee chairman during the early 1970s, used to joke that Watergate happened on his day off, and the Robert Dole who said this week that &quot;we have a special responsibility to the American people&quot; because the Iran affair &quot;happened on our watch.&quot;    In the past month, Mr. Dole, maintaining a dizzying pace, has managed to keep the offensive, in part by providing the press with a news peg for each one of his appearances. Yet the Dole initiatives sometimes go in different directions.    First he recommended, over the objection of other Republican leaders, a special session of Congress to create a select committee to investigate the affair. (The president declined, and Senate and House select committees will be formally constituted next month.) Sen. Dole warned that the crisis was hurting the GOP's prospects for winning the 1988 election. He urged that an independent counsel take over the investigation.    But then, on Dec. 7, he called the entire affair a potential &quot;dry hole,&quot; suggesting there may be no new major developments.    Mr. Dole continually has found new openings. He wrote a letter to the Washington Post urging the principals in the affair to go to Oval Office and provide the president with details of their activities. Last weekend he first urged the president to call a summit meeting with allies. Then, in a speech in New Hampshire, site of the first presidential primary, he pronounced the diversion of arms profits to the Nicaraguan Contras &quot;just plain stupid.&quot; By Sunday, however, he was acknowledging that Donald Regan, the chief of staff, should retain his position.    &quot;To even comment on this is risky for a presidential candidate,&quot; says David Keene, an adviser to Mr. Dole. &quot;You have to walk a fine line. You can't insult or even appear to attack the president. Anyone who wants to succeed Ronald Reagan isn't going to be able to if he makes Reagan look bad.&quot;    And though John Buckley, Rep. Kemp's press secretary, accused Mr. Dole of being &quot;too eager to make news over the corpse of a popular president,&quot; this series of events earned the senator plaudits from some New Right political figures who once regarded the Kansan with discomfort. &quot;The country right now is looking for someone who's tough, particularly with the White House floundering,&quot; says Richard Viguerie, a New Right leader who still supports Mr. Kemp.    Mr. Kemp has positioned himself against nearly every element of Mr. Dole's offensive. He took issue with the proposal for a special session of Congress. He opposed an outside counsel. He criticized the proposal for a meeting of Western allies. The NATO nations, he says, &quot;understand America is a strong ally; they know we haven't lost our mind.&quot;    The refrain &quot;enough is enough&quot; repeatedly has turned up in his rhetoric. &quot;The liberal Democrats,&quot; he writes in an Op-Ed article that is to appear today in the Manchester Union Leader in New Hampshire, &quot;have Contra aid in the cross hairs of their legislative guns.&quot; But some Republicans believe the current crisis underlines Mr. Kemp's lack of foreign-policy experience.    The affair, however, has put Mr. Bush under the most strain. As vice president, he is painted with the same brush as Mr. Reagan. He can't break from the president or even suggest how he might have acted differently.    Mr. Bush's advisers acknowledge that his fortunes now are tied to the hope that voters see him project grace under pressure, which he will try to display again tomorrow when he speaks in Iowa, site of the first presidential caucuses. &quot;When this passes, and it will, Bush is going to do very well by the people in our party who value loyalty,&quot; says Lee Atwater, a Bush adviser.    But other Republicans believe that the damage to Mr. Bush isn't only his ties to the Contra imbroglio but also the loss of an opportunity to develop his own campaign message. &quot;His ability to go out and be seen is being impaired,&quot; says John Sears, a GOP political strategist. &quot;His ability to talk about the future is impaired. Now he can't even go out and say that he wants to continue the policies of the president.&quot;    Few of the other GOP presidential candidates have had a political impact as the Iran crisis has unfolded.    Former Secretary of State Alexander Haig, another GOP aspirant, has been appearing on national television shows -- he was on the &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour,&quot; &quot;Nightline&quot; and &quot;Today&quot; in a 12-hour period one day late last month -- but he has been tarnished by reports he gave Israel permission to ship spare parts and plane tires to Iran as early as 1981.    Former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker of Tennessee urged the White House &quot;to take the lead in getting the story out,&quot; but Mr. Baker is no longer considered likely to undertake a presidential campaign and has let it be known that he may be interested in becoming White House chief of staff if Mr. Regan departs. Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada, whose chief credential was his close ties to the president, now seems more likely to be a White House adviser than a candidate. </TEXT></DOC>
