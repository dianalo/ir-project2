<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-25-0671 </DOCNO><TEXT>An arrangement for use in the protection of pipes and trunks in a splashzone on a rig construction or similar installation at sea using a cylindricalcontainer closed below and open above and arranged along the pipe orthe trunk. The container which is of two-part construction has a longitudinaldimension which spans over normally submerged and normally exposed pipeand trunk portions. The container is employed for cleaning, inspectionand application of corrosion protective medium on the pipe and trunksurfaces bounded by the container. There is defined between the containerand the pipe or trunk an annular chamber of limited breadth, In the chamber,a carriage unit is movable in the axial direction and peripheral directionof the chamber and supports equipment for cleaning, inspection and applicationof corrosive protective zmedium. A method of using this arrangement involvesassembling the two parts of the container around the pipe or trunk, drainingthe annular chamber and actuating the carriage unit to effect movementthereof around the pipe or trunk as well as axially of the latter whilesimultaneously actuating the supported equipment. 3 drawings.</TEXT></DOC>
