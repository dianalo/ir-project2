The program establishes a control zone calledthe Ho'omalu Zone, in which a person must have a limited entry permit tofish, and a qualifying zone called the Mau Zone, in which a person couldearn points to qualify for future eligibility for a limited entry permit.Persons who can demonstrate participation in, or substantial financialcommitment to participate in the NWHI fishery, on or before August 7, 1985,would be eligible for initial permits to participate in the Ho'omalu Zonefishery. A landings requirement is established to maintain eligibilityfor annual renewal of permits. No new permits to enter the fishery willbe issued until stocks are sufficiently large to provide adequate catches.A point system is established to qualify persons for permits for futureentry to the fishery. The Western Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council),with the advice of an industry and government Advisory Review Board, willmake recommendations to the Regional Director, Southwest Region, NMFS,regarding future entry to the fishery. The objectives of the limited accessprogram are to reduce the risk of overfishing, reduce the level of overcapitalizationin the fishery, increase stability in the fishery, and increase profitabilityor net return to the fishery. The Council will undertake a full evaluationof the effectiveness of the program in 5 years. Under the rule, it is aviolation of Federal law to fail to report fishery data in accordance withState reporting requirements and vessel operators must notify the U.S.Coast Guard prior to anticipated arrival in port to unload bottomfish takenin the NWHI.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATES: </T2>September 6, 1988.

The FMP was developedby the Council under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act(MFCMA) and implemented August 27, 1986 (51 FR 27413, July 31, 1986).The notice of availability of Amendment 2 to the FMP was published on April18, 1988 (53 FR 12712) and the proposed rule was published on May 11, 1988(53 FR 16735). Comments were invited until June 20, 1988. One written commentwas received.The preamble to the proposed rule presented in substantial detail the featuresof the limited access program proposed for the NWHI and that discussionwill not be repeated here.This final rule is scheduled to go into effect January 1, 1989. Interestedpersons should be advised that the Regional Director, Southwest Region,NMFS, will be working with the Council and the State of Hawaii to preparefor implementation of the Ho'omalu Zone permit requirement and other provisionsof the limited access program. Persons who wish to obtain permits underthis program are urged to obtain application forms from the Southwest Regionand to compile and submit the necessary documentation of participationin the fishery, or of financial commitments made for participation in thefishery by November 30, 1988, in time for review and award of permits inadvance of the effective date. The NMFS also will arrange the protectedspecies seminars required for captains and relief captains and will adviseapplicants of the time and location of seminars when permit applicationswere received.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Responses</ITAG>Written comments were received from one individual.<T3>Comment:</T3> The individual objected to the proposed limited accessprogram because he had been advised that he might not qualify for an initialpermit. He indicated he had previously supported the proposal when he hadbeen assured that he would qualify.<T3>Response:</T3> Whether or not this person would qualify is not yetknown. Under the program, the Southwest Regional Director will make a decisionbased on the information presented in support of an application, includingdocumentation of participation in the fishery on or before August 7, 1985,or of a firm commitment or offer to buy a vessel for the fishery on orbefore August 7, 1985. It also is noted that even if the individual doesnot qualify for an initial permit under the criteria of the program, hemay qualify for subsequent entry to the fishery under the point systemfor new participation when the Regional Director concludes that stock andeconomic conditions warrant additional entry.<ITAG tagnum="84">Changes From the Proposed Rule in the Final Rule </ITAG>A prohibition that did not appear in the proposed rule is added in theregulatory text of the final rule. The proposed rule and this final rulecontain andSection; 683.27, which requires fishermen to notify the U.S. CoastGuard at least 24 hours before making any landing of bottomfish from theHo'omalu Zone. This final rule adds a new paragraph (n) to andSection; 683.6,General prohibitions, which expressly prohibits failure to comply withthe requirement of andSection; 683.27. <ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>The Director, Southwest Region, NMFS, determined that the Amendment, asapproved, is necessary for the conservation and management of the NWHIbottomfish resource and is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicablelaw. The Council included an environmental review as part of the FMP amendmentand an environmental assessment was prepared. The Assistant Administratorfor Fisheries, NOAA concluded that there will be no significant impacton the human environment as a result of this rule. Implementation of this rule is not an action that may affect any specieslisted as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act of1972 (Act), or the critical habitat of those species. The Council initiatedinformal consultations with NMFS under section 7 to the Act and it wasconcluded that the action was not likely to have adverse effects on anylisted species or critical habitat. The Under Secretary, NOAA, determined that this rule is not a ``major rule''requiring a regulatory impact analysis under Executive Order 12291. A summaryof this determination appears in the proposed rule (53 FR 16735, May 11,1988) and is based on the regulatory impact review (RIR) which is includedin the Amendment. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the ChiefCounsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that this rulewill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. A summary of this determination appears in the proposedrule. This final rule contains collection of information requirements subjectto the Paperwork Reduction Act. These collection of information requirementscontained in this rule were approved by the Office of Management and Budgetunder Control Number 0648-0201. Public reporting burdens for these collectionof information requirements are estimated to average 1 hour per responsefor the permit requirement and 4 minutes per response for each advancednotification of the U.S. Coast Guard before landing bottomfish. These estimatesinclude the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing date sources,gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewingthe collection of information. Send comments regarding these burden estimatesor any other aspect of these collection of information requirements, includingsuggestions for reducing these burdens, to Charles Fullerton, Director,Southwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, NOAA, 300 South FerrySt., Terminal Island, CA 90731; and to the Office of Information and RegulatoryAffairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. The Council determined that this rule will be implemented in a manner thatis consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the approved coastalzone management program of Hawaii. The State of Hawaii concurred with thisdetermination. This final rule does not contain policies with federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under ExecutiveOrder 12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 683 </ITAG>Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 3, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.

(b) <T3>Supplementary requirements for initial permits. </T3>An applicationfor an initial permit under this paragraph must be filed within 5 yearsof the effective date of this program. A permit for a vessel to be usedfor fishing for bottomfish in the Ho'omalu Zone may be issued to:  (1) Any owner who can document that a vessel owned by him made one or morequalifying landings of bottomfish from the NWHI on or before August 7,1985.(2) Any owner of two or more vessels which qualify under paragraph (b)(1)of this section may obtain a permit for each of such vessels which alsomade at least one qualifying landing of bottomfish in 1986 and 1987.(3) Any person who can document that on or before August 7, 1985, he orshe had incurred substantial expenditures for or had received written approvalof a loan to purchase or construct a vessel to be used in the NWHI bottomfishfishery.(4) Any person who can document that on or before August 7, 1985, he orshe made an offer to purchase a vessel for the NWHI bottomfish fisheryor had such a vessel under construction.(5) Any person who can document that he or she was captain of a vesselthat made at least one qualifying landing of bottomfish the NWHI on orbefore August 7, 1985, and who becomes an owner or 50% or more interestin a vessel within 5 years of the effective date of this program.(c) <T3>Supplementary requirements for permit renewal.</T3> (1) A permit willbe eligible for renewal if the vessel covered by the permit makes threeor more qualifying landings during the permit year.(2) The owner of a permitted vessel that did not make three or more qualifyinglandings of bottomfish in a year may apply to the Regional Director forwaiver of the landing requirement. If the Regional Director finds thatfailure to make three landings was due to circumstances beyond the owner'scontrol, he may renew the permit. A waiver may not be granted if the failureto make three landings was due to general economic conditions or marketconditions such that the vessel operations would not be profitable.(d) <T3>Supplementary requirements for new entry permits. </T3>The RegionalDirector may issue new vessel permits under this part when the RegionalDirector has determined, in consultation with the Council, that bottomfishstocks in the Ho'omalu Zone are able to support additional fishing effort.This shall be established by determining that the total estimated annualrevenue to the fleet exceeds the total estimated annual fixed and variablecosts to the fleet in the Ho'omalu Zone by an amount at least equal tothe average cost of a vessel year. This determination shall be made andpublished annually in association with the annual report required underandSection; 683.24 of this part.(e) <T3>Eligibility. </T3>When the Regional Director has determined that newpermits may be issued, they shall be issued to applicants based upon eligibilitydetermined as follows:(1)<T3> Point System.</T3> (i) Two points shall be assigned for each yearin which the applicant was owner or captain of a vessel which made threeor more qualifying landings of bottomfish from the NWHI.(ii) One point shall be assigned for each year in which the applicant wasowner or captain of a vessel that landed at least 6,000 pounds of bottomfishfrom the main Hawaiian Islands.(iii) Points will be assigned only under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this sectionor under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section for any one year.(iv) Points will be assigned for every year for which the requisite landingscan be documented.(2) An applicant must own at least a 25 percent share in the vessel thatthe permit would cover, and only one permit will be assigned to any vessel.(3) New permits shall be awarded to applicants in descending order, startingwith the applicant with the largest number of points. If two or more personshave an equal number of points, and there are insufficient new permitsfor all such applicants, the new permits shall be awarded by the RegionalDirector through a lottery.(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(3) of this section, a person who originallyqualifies for and obtains a permit under andSection; 683.25(a) and who voluntarilysurrenders that permit to the Regional Director within the first 5 yearsof this program will have priority over applicants under the point scalesystem for a new permit under this section. If two or more persons qualifyunder this provision, the person surrendering a permit at the earliestdate will have first priority. If two or more such person are equally qualifiedunder the date of surrender criterion, the permit shall be awarded by theRegional Directory by a lottery. A permit holder may qualify for this provisiononly one time.(5) The Regional Director shall place a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and shall use other means to notify prospectiveapplicants of the opportunity to file applications for new permits underthis program. 9.
