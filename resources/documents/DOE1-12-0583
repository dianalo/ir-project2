<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-12-0583 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors approach the problem of forecasting the total energy productionfrom a PWR core by constructing a statistical model for reduced-scalenumerical testing of fuel pin assemblies similar in design to those tobe used in the core. They assume that test conditions are identical withoperating conditions and that the power is produced uniformly over thevolume of the test assembly. The monitoring feature for pin-sheath failureis the increased specific radioactivity of the coolant and for this reasonthe failure criterion for pin assemblies is taken as a preset limitingvalue of coolant radioactivity. Energy production in the core beforethis event occurs is taken as the basic characteristic of the workinglife. Another assumption for the model is that the power distributionis independent of time and coincides with the thermal neutron flux distribution.The authors also assume that coolant radioactivity is determined mainlyby short-lived isotopes and that contributions to the total activityfrom individual defects are the same if the power densities are equalin the formation zones. The last assumption of the model is that at eachinstant the contribution to coolant activity from a previously formedand developing defect is identified with the equivalent contributionfrom the corresponding number of elementary defects. Possible escapeof fuel from the pins and contamination of the loop are not considered.</TEXT></DOC>
