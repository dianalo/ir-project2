In the year-earlier period, Carolco had net income of $8.8million, or 28 cents a share.</LP><TEXT>   Carolco said its latest results aren't directly comparablewith the year-earlier figures because of a change inaccounting treatment triggered by Carolco's increased votingrights in Live stock. Carolco said it continues to study aLive proposal to merge the two entertainment concerns.   Carolco said the quarter's results included &quot;certainadvances&quot; on the release of the movie, &quot;Terminator 2:Judgment Day,&quot; starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, which openedJuly 3. The bulk of the film's revenue will be recorded inthe fourth quarter and next year, said Peter M. Hoffman,president and chief executive officer of the independent filmcompany. Through Sunday, the film had grossed $168.4 million,he said.   &quot;We now believe that the total U.S. and Canadian boxoffice will exceed $200 million,&quot; Mr. Hoffman said. &quot;Earlyindications give us confidence that its theatricalperformance outside the U.S. will generate a total box officeeven greater than the domestic estimate.&quot;   Lou Weiss, Carolco chief financial officer, wouldn't saywhether he expects the revenue from the movie to allow thecompany to post a profit for the year.   Carolco posted a second-quarter loss from continuingoperations of $7.6 million, or 27 cents a share. It citedlower-than-expected sales of films to the TV syndicationmarket and higher interest expense.   Consolidated revenue was $144.1 million. Revenue a yearearlier was $80.5 million. Carolco's revenue from featurefilms declined 2% to $75.6 million from $77.4 million.</TEXT></DOC>
