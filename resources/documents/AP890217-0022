Robert E. Allen said Thursday that the Bell companies that werecreated in the 1984 breakup of ATandamp;T are monopolies and should beregulated as such. To allow them into the long-distance andmanufacturing arenas, as Congress and the courts are considering,would turn back the clock on the post-1984 gains such as lowerequipment prices, lower long-distance rates and more widespread useof telephones, he said.   The Bell companies could potentially ``do a lot of damage tocompetitors'' in markets currently protected by the 1984 consentdecree, Allen said at a meeting of the Federal Communications BarAssociation.   ``If that happens,'' he said, ``the force of antitrust law willbe blunted. Competition may wane and consumers may suffer.''   He said that under the decree, which prevented the regional Bellcompanies from manufacturing equipment or providing long-distance orinformation services, ``suppliers have flourished, spurred by theknowledge that the (regional Bell companies) have no `inside'manufacturer with an `inside' track.''   Allowing them to manufacture would not improve the nation's tradedeficit or create new jobs, Allen said.   The regional companies would be inclined to go overseas to buycritical switches for phone equipment because of the high costs ofdeveloping their own, Allen said.   ``To get into this business would mean alliances between the(regional Bell companies) and switching companies in Japan, Germany,Sweden, France, Canada or Great Britain,'' he said.   He said that while the United States debates the regulationissue, foreign competitors are racing ahead, thanks to governmentsubsidies.   He said he wasn't calling for subsidies but for the government to``unleash the competitive information industry in this country.''   ``Regulators need to act, where they are clearly free to do so,to enhance rather than hinder the competitiveness of Americanbusiness,'' he said.   Allen, who assumed the ATandamp;T chairmanship last April, said thereshould be less regulation in competitive marketplaces such aslong-distance calling, where about 500 companies, including MCICommunications Corp. and US Sprint, are battling ATandamp;T.   ``In the competitive part of the industry, regulators have beenslow to remove restraints. This has denied the nation the fullbenefit of all competitors being able to compete flat out. And this,in turn, penalizes America when it needs the very best technology tosucceed in a time of intense international competition,'' he said.   ``Divestiture worked,'' he said of the ATandamp;T breakup. ``Itpromised protection of consumers by driving a clean wedge betweenthe monopoly markets and the competitive markets.''   He said ATandamp;T now was just one of many communications networks inthe nation. He said it was unfair that it be regulated in acompetitive marketplace while leaders in other industries, such ascomputers, are not.   ``One is overly restrained ... the other is not restrained atall,'' Allen said.</TEXT></DOC>
