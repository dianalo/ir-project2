The following is a discussion of these items. Generic Letter 86-10allows licensees to make changes to their approved fire protection programwithout prior Commission approval if those changes would not adverselyaffect the ability to achieve and maintain safe shutdown. Generic Letter86-10 also defines changes which would adversely affect the ability toachieve and maintain safe shutdown. The licensee has proposed a definitiondifferent from that contained in the Generic Letter; the proposed definitionhas been found unacceptable. Therefore, that portion of the proposed fireprotection license condition has been denied. In addition to the abovepartial denial, three other provisions in the proposed fire protectionlicense condition were not included because they were satisfied by thelicensees' submittal of August 25, 1988. Also, the proposed addition ofTechnical Specification 6.9.3 was not included because it is not required.The application for amendments complies with the standards and requirementsof the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission'srules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings asrequired by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFRChapter I, which are set forth in the license amendments.Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments and Opportunity for Hearingin connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 9, 1988 (53 FR 35138). No requestfor a hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thisnotice.The Commission has prepared an Environmental Assessment related to theaction and has determined that an environmental impact statement will notbe prepared and that issuance of the amendments will have no significantadverse effect on the quality of the human environment.For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applicationfor amendments dated May 6, 1988, as supplemented by letters dated August25 and December 7, 1988 (2) Amendment No. 69 to License No. NPF-10 andAmendment No. 38 to License No. NPF-15, (3) the Commission's related SafetyEvaluation and (4) the Commission's Environmental Assessment.
