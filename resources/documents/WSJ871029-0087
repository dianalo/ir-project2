Suddenly there's a glut of slick-looking reports, newsletters and other publications for both internal and external consumption, all produced without the benefit of desingers by almost anyone with a small computer and a graphics program. As the output goes up, designers say, the quality of design and communication goes down.    &quot;I'm disturbed by this,&quot; says Kerry Bierman, director of marketing at the American Medical Association in Chicago. &quot;There's an art to designing printed matter, and I don't see it having a very long life if everyone who writes something is his own publisher.&quot;    For example, Earl Powell, director of the Design Management Institute in Boston, describes what happened at one company. &quot;A sales manager wanted to get some new-product information into the field as quickly as possible, so he put out his own spec sheet,&quot; he says. &quot;The sales people began showing it to customers, and pretty soon it was all over the place. But it looked like someone had given a first-grader a new box of 89 crayons -- there was one of every type face. It looked awful, and no attention had been paid to how to best present the information or what the corporate objectives were.&quot;    Even good-looking documents play havoc with a corporate identity program, where the appearance of printed matter is coordinated to reinforce an image or other strategy.    &quot;The trouble is that all these individuals reflect their own personal agenda,&quot; says Gwen Amos, a Sacramento, Calif.-based design consultant to such companies as Hewlett Packard and IBM. &quot;We want the company to be speaking with one voice, not 10.&quot;    Companies that make desktop-publishing hardware and software hope to solve the problem by building in such aids as style sheets and selections of type that blend well. But that work is preliminary. And besides, how much design assistance can be added to a program without making it too complicated for general use?    But even if they succeed, the AMA's Mr. Bierman sees a further problem. &quot;If the computer industry comes out with a software kit that lets you create your own identity program,&quot; he says, &quot;I'm afraid we'll end up with everything looking alike.&quot; Not to mention with fewer graphic designers.    Too Flattering   A continuing problem for innovative American companies and their designers has been the impunity with which overseas pirates copy successful products. Despite years of lobbying by design groups, the U.S. remains one of the few industrialized nations without laws protecting design. Patents are generally limited to functional innovation and copyrights to functionless ornamentation; design falls between these categories.    A recent federal court decision in New York may offer an alternative. Ironically, it involves an Italian lamp, the well-known Tizio, designed by Richard Sapper for Artemide and distributed in this country by a subsidiary. Judge John M. Canella, in granting a preliminary injunction against sales of a similar lamp made in Taiwan, found that the Tizio's &quot;trade dress&quot; had been violated.    Trade dress is related to a trademark, and until recently has been applied mostly to package labeling. George Gottlieb, Artemide's lawyer, says the New York decision extends the principle to the product itself. &quot;If the manufacturer can demonstrate that the 'look' of the article is well-known and that consumers buy the product not only because they like it but because they associate it with a specific source, then copyists can be prevented from making an identical or closely similar item, so that there will not be confusion among the public,&quot; he says.    &quot;Of course,&quot; he adds, &quot;it would be better to have a statutory design patent, but this is an important step forward.&quot;    Wait! No Reading!   Warning labels on potentially dangerous products may not have much effect, according to a paper presented last week at the Human Factors Society annual meeting in New York. A team from Failure Analysis Associates, Palo Alto, Calif., described an experiment in which two groups of expectant first-time mothers were asked to install an infant carrier in a car according to instruction labels. One group's label had a warning in a federally mandated format. The other had instructions but no warning. The first group made slightly more errors installing the carriers.    The study also found that what the women thought of the labels wasn't much help in predicting their effectiveness. Most subjects rated the labels &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;good,&quot; regardless of whether the individuals made installation errors. </TEXT></DOC>
