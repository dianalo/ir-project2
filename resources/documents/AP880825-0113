The depression was centered about 35 miles west-southwest ofSanto Domingo and was packing winds of 35 mph with storm-forcegusts, according to a 6 a.m. EDT advisory by the National HurricaneCenter in Miami.   ``The movement over land is the only thing that's keeping thisfrom strengthening into a tropical storm,'' said forecaster BobCase.   The depression, moving toward the west-northwest at 15 mph, wasexpected to trigger rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches in theDominican Republic, where flash-flood warnings were in effect.   Flash-flood warnings remained in effect for Puerto Rico, where6.6 inches of rain were reported over the past 24 hours.   Two men and a 12-year-old boy were killed in Puerto Rico in twoseparate incidents Wednesday night when trees crushed their cars asthey were driving along rural roads, police said.   State Secretary Sila Calderon declared a state of emergency andNational Guard units were mobilized to rescue families trapped byswollen rivers.   In Mayaguez on the western side of the island, the Civil Defenseordered hundreds of residents in low-lying areas to abandon theirhomes.   More than 100 homes in different parts of the island weredestroyed or seriously damaged by flooding, according to the CivilDefense.   Education Department Secretary Awilda Aponte Roque closed publicschools throughout Puerto Rico because of flooding danger.   A second depression remained far off in the Atlantic, about1,000 miles west-northwest of the Cape Verde Islands off westAfrica. It was moving west at about 17 mph and had sustained windsof 35 mph.   ``As far north as it is now, the chances of it getting here arepretty slim,'' Case said.   Depressions are upgraded to tropical storms when their sustainedwinds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when winds hit 74 mph.   There have been two tropical storms so far in the 1988 AtlanticOcean hurricane season, but neither reached hurricane strength. Theseason runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.</TEXT></DOC>
