The charge, which the Chicago-based regional Belltelephone company said will reduce fourth-quarter earnings byabout 53 cents a share, follows recently announced charges byother Baby Bells, though it isn't as large. U S West Inc.last week said it would take a $590 million charge to coverthe cost of leaving the real-estate business and 6,000 jobcuts. Nynex Corp., BellSouth Corp. and Bell Atlantic Corp.also have disclosed charges in the past month.</LP><TEXT>   In the fourth quarter of 1990, Ameritech earned $286.8million, or $1.09 a share, on revenue of $2.69 billion. Forthe year, it earned $1.25 billion, or $4.73 a share, onrevenue of $10.7 billion.   Ameritech also said yesterday it would raise its quarterlydividend on common stock by three cents a share to 88 cents.Its board authorized the repurchase of as many as 10 millioncommon shares on the open market or through privatetransactions over the next three years.   Ameritech stock finished at $63.125 a share in compositetrading on the New York Stock Exchange, up 37.5 cents ashare.   &quot;The regional Bell companies know that what happened toATandamp;T is going to happen to them,&quot; said Greg Sawers,telecommunications analyst at Sanford Bernstein andamp; Co.&quot;Competition is coming, and it will lower prices and marketshare, necessitating a lower cost structure.&quot;   About $52 million of Ameritech's charge will cover workforce reductions. These include a new plan to eliminate inthree to five years about 2,300 jobs, mostly from management,said a spokesman. &quot;It's in keeping with our long-term plan toreduce management ranks,&quot; which currently total about 24,000employees. The rest of the cuts, which will be made through&quot;attrition, retirement incentives or dismissals&quot; could comefrom craft and office workers, he added. Charges will also betaken for a previously announced voluntary retirement programfor managers. Since the program was announced in Septembermore than 2,000 managers have taken Ameritech up on its offerand must leave by year end, the spokesman said.   Another $67 million in charges will be taken to coverasset write-downs, including some network facilities used byAmeritech Audiotex Services, which provides phone informationlines to business customers, and some software projects, thespokesman said. The remaining $21 million in charges willcover partly the retirement of debt at the Michigan BellTelephone Co. subsidiary and nonrecurring charges atAmeritech's unregulated subsidiaries, the spokesman said.   Ameritech said it will notify holders of Michigan Bell's9.6% debentures due Oct. 1, 2008, that it will redeem all$175 million of the aggregate principal amount stilloutstanding on Jan. 31. Ameritech said the debentures will beredeemed by the Bank of New York at a price of $1,041.10 foreach $1,000 principal amount together with interest accruedto the redemption date.   Michigan Bell said the bonds are being called because oflower interest rates and that the call will be funded withshort-term debt until long-term debt is reissued, possibly inthe first half of 1992. The 33-year debentures were issuedOct. 1, 1975.</TEXT></DOC>
