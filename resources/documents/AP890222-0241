James D. Watkins, the energysecretary-designate, told his Senate confirmation hearing today hisfirst priority would be to seek major changes in the way thegovernment runs its troubled nuclear weapons complex.   Watkins said the Energy Department's defense program ``has notbrought itself into line with nearly all other public and privatenuclear ventures that have now capitalized on lessons learned''since the 1979 reactor accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.   ``There is an urgent need to effect a significant change in itsdeeply embedded 35-year culture,'' Watkins told the Senate Energyand Natural Resources Committee, adding that he would seek to makethe department's nuclear operations better run and more open.   ``Problems relating to safety, health and the environment havenot only been backlogged to intolerable levels but, in effect,hidden from public view until recently,'' he said.   Watkins also said he would seek to reduce U.S. dependence onforeign oil and to promote greater use of renewable energy sourcessuch as solar power.   Congressional debate focused in the final five months of theReagan administration on the once-secret nuclear facilities was ondetermining how bad the safety, technical and managerial problemsare at the 17-site complex.   Recently, however, the spotlight has begun moving toward the morecomplex and politically sensitive question of how to clean up anenvironmental mess that the government acknowledges was caused inpart by too much focus on production goals.   The Energy Department's facilities develop, build and testnuclear warheads for the Pentagon. A key link in the network _ atrio of nuclear reactors at Savannah River Plant in South Carolina _has been shut down since last spring because of safety concerns anda series of management and technical problems.   A key dilemma facing Watkins, if he is confirmed in the post, ishow to get the problem reactors running again in order to assure asupply of nuclear materials.   Equally pressing, however, is the issue of cleaning up thepollution from past operations _ the extent of which the governmentacknowledges is not yet known.   Billions of gallons of radioactive waste have been dumped intosoil and groundwater at and around the nuclear plants, which havebeen operated under contract by private companies since the late1940s. While the Energy Department maintains that public health andsafety are not yet threatened it says the risks _ and costs _ growthe longer an environmental cleanup is put off.   Watkins said when his nomination was announced Jan. 12 that hewas extremely conscious of environmental needs, but he made nopublic comments before his Senate hearing on a plan developed by theReagan administration for modernizing the weapons plants.   Environmental groups have been critical of President Bush'schoice of Watkins, who served a four-year stint as chief of navaloperations before ending his 41-year military career in 1986. He hasno experience in the commercial energy field.   ``We are concerned that the appointment of Adm. Watkins signalsthat cleaning up the bomb plants and developing a sound nationalenergy policy will continue to be sacrificed in the name of nuclearweapons production,'' Dan. W. Reicher, an attorney with theenvironmental group Natural Resources Defense Council, said shortlyafter Watkins' nomination.   Watkins, 61, studied nuclear reactor engineering in 1958 at theOak Ridge, Tenn., National Laboratory, one of the EnergyDepartment's key nuclear weapons facilities.   He was an instructor at naval nuclear power training centers in1960 and in 1964 when he took command of the nuclear-poweredsubmarine Snook.   While he enters the Energy Department at a time of heightenedconcern about the nuclear weapons program, Watkins also faces toughproblems in the conventional energy field, including a troubledcommercial nuclear power industry.   Chief among the more traditional issues is the United States'growing dependence on foreign oil, caused by rising consumption andfalling domestic production. The Reagan administration said risingoil imports posed a potential threat to national security, but itdetermined that no import restrictions were justified.   The Watkins confirmation hearing originally was scheduled forFeb. 2. The White House asked for a postponement, citing a delay inpreparing Watkins' finanicial disclosure reports andlonger-than-expected FBI probes of other Cabinet nominees.</TEXT></DOC>
