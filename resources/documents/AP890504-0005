They had wrested control of the road to the Soviet border, thelifeline for the capital, Kabul.   Until a month ago, it had been under the control of rebelcommander Akmed Shah Masoon and his Jamait-i-Islami group, whofrequently clamp a stranglehold on the route and cut off essentialsupplies of food and fuel.   And the soldiers appeared more determined than ever to keep itfrom falling back into Masood's hands.   ``If he tries to take it again, we'll teach him a lesson hewon't forget,'' said one 30-year-old soldier, who gave his nameonly as Capo.   On Wednesday the government took a small contingent of foreignjournalists along a 20-mile stretch of the highway. It was thefirst such trip since the Soviet Union 2{ months ago pulled out thelast of its troops who had been supporting the Marxist Afghangovernment.   Along the road that winds through the majestic Hindu Kushmountains north toward the Soviet border, the soldiers stood besidetheir embattled roadside checkpoints and mountaintop observationposts as the small caravan of armored personnel carriers passed.   Some of the soldiers saluted. Others waved or applauded. Forthem, it was their moment of triumph in the midst of widespreaddestruction. Nothing stood intact from years of shelling andbombing.   Their success would not have been thought possible inmid-February, when the Red Army ended nine years of militaryinvolvement in Afghanistan. Many people predicted the Afghan armedforces would be plagued by mass defections. Those who did notswitch sides _ according to one line of conjecture _ would not beable to stand on their own against the guerrillas, armed andsupported by the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and China.   Brig. Gen. Mohammad Shafi said his group proved them wrong.   ``It needs no further explanation. You can see for yourself,''said Shafi, who assumed commnd of the infantry unit that guards theroad a few weeks before the final Soviet pullout.   The village of Bagh-e-Maidan, about 65 miles north of Kabul, isproof of the devastation of 11 years of fighting between the Afghanarmed forces and the Moslem guerrillas.   ``Masood was responsible for this,'' Shafi said of the ruinsthat were once an ancient village carved in the mountain.   But some soldiers under his command disagree.   ``The Russians did it,'' said one soldier.   The soldier, who spoke on condition that he not be identified,said about 500 people were killed in one pulverizing raid onBagh-e-Maidan.   Shafi estimated that 180 villages in the area had been destroyedover the years. No one knows how many people were killed.   The United States earlier this year accused the Soviet Union of``carpet bombing'' to clear the area before the final Red Armypullout on Feb. 15. The Soviets denied it.   But in late January, the Soviet and Afghan armed forces launcheda three-day offensive with bombers, artillery and tanks to clearthe Salang. Officials said at least 650 people were killed.   About four miles farther north, the smell of smoke permeates theair and the roadside is cluttered with rows of destroyed tanks andsupply trucks.   Soldiers said the rebels had stopped the vehicles and demandedsome kind of toll to pass through. If they refused, the driver wasshot and the vehicle was doused with fuel and set ablaze,thesoldiers said.   A month ago, the military moved in and cleared the area in agunbattle that left at least 250 rebels dead. Masood's lieutenant,Abdul Bashir, was wounded but escaped, Shafi said.   About 400 government troops occupy the area now.   ``There hasn't been a major battle since then,'' Shafi said.   And he said the road has been open for columns of supply convoysto move toward Kabul.   On Tuesday night, the general said, 1,800 trucks and tanks beganmoving slowly toward Kabul and would reach the capital soon.   The convoy had not reached the city of 2.25 million by Wednesdaynight.   Soon, he said, it may not matter. The government has beenconstructing another route to detour through the rebel-controlledareas.</TEXT></DOC>
