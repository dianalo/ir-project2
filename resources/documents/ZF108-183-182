Little, a management consulting firm basedin Cambridge, Mass., ranked marketing applications third on a list of the top10 computer applications planned by businesses for last year.andP;  The previousyear, marketing applications ranked tenth.andP;  The survey also found that themanufacturing concerns, chemical companies, and the energy industry were themost interested in computerizing their companies' marketing and salesdivisions, more so than insurance companies, banks, and utilities.andM;&quot;It's an attempt to increase the productivity and effectiveness of themarketing and sales representatives,&quot; says Norman Weizer, the seniorconsultant who conducted the study.andP;  &quot;Salespeople spend a hell of a lot ofvaluable time filling out paperwork.&quot;andM;New and well-established companies are racing to develop hardware systems andspecialized software for such tasks as analysis of market data, demographicmapping, and product design.andP;  All these products are aimed at sales forcesand marketing managers.andM;Hewlett-Packard is so convinced that its computer systems will improveproductivity that it guarantees it.andP;  As part of a new advertising campaign,HP says that if a customer buys a HP system and does not experience measuredproductivity gains in marketing and sales in a year, HP will refund thepurchase price.andM;&quot;We're very confident about this,&quot; says Russ McBrien, HP'smarketing-applications manager.andM;Computer-industry experts say this desire among companies to computerizemarketing and sales functions has just recently become widespread.andO;Historically, marketing and sales have taken a back seat to otherdepartments.andM;The historical perspectiveandM;In the 1960s and 1970s, when big computers first came on the scene and cost abundle, businesses purchased them for their most integral and time-consumingtasks--namely, counting money and paying people.andP;  In those days, acounting,payroll, and finance departments became the most likely places to findcomputers inside corporations.andM;In the 1980s, when the cost of computers dropped dramatically, corporationsbegan to use them to cut manufacturing costs.andP;  These days, at least half ofall manufacturing firms have automated production facilities.andM;As the costs of manufacturing fell, marketing and sales functions began tograb the larger share of a product's budget.andP;  Available at the same time weremore-powerful desktop PCs, portable computers, and relatively inexpensivelocal area networks, which could link PCs and workstations with minicomputersand mainframes.andP;  Suddenly, companies began looking for ways to use these newcomputer systems to make their marketing and sales forces more effective.andM;They quickly found them.andP;  As a result, insurance salespeople are now usingportable computers to give instant price quotes on policies to prospectivecustomers.andP;  Loan officers are using local area networks to get loan approvalsfor their clients in hours rather than days.andP;  Food distributors haveinstalled computerized information networks so that sales representatives cancall in to get immediate updates on which products are in stock and which areon order.andP;  Salespeople for companies that produce consumer goods bring storemanagers computer-generated maps of their communities.andP;  They do this todemonstrate how the local demographics (the number of senior citizens offamilies with young children in the neighborhood, for example) suggest thatcertain products will sell particularly well.andM;Selling by exampleandM;At many business service companies, salespeople carry around customized,computer-generated financial models that demonstrate solutions to a widevariety of their customers' business concerns, such as inventory control orbilling.andM;Howard Anderson, at The Yankee Group, offers one example.andP;  A salesrepresentative for a machinery manufacturer might tell a customer that he isbuying product XYZ in 10-gallon drums.andP;  The sales representative whips out acomputer model that shows that based on the company's growth and its use ofthe product, it would make more sense to purchase the product in 100-gallondrums.andP;  The sales rep concludes the pitch by suggesting that the customer buyforklifts for the 100-gallon drums from his company.andM;&quot;We're seeing the next generation of salespeople,&quot; says Anderson.andP;  &quot;They'revery comfortable using new technology.&quot;andM;At Frito-Lay officials expressed surprise at the speed with which their salesforce adapted to using hand-held computers.andP;  Beverly Holmes, spokeswoman forFrito-Lay, says the company overestimated by six months the amount of time itwould take to implement the system.andP;  &quot;Once [the sales force] saw the timesavings in paperwork, the response was terrific.&quot;andM;Frito-Lay's marketing people are equally pleased.andP;  Previously, by the timemarketing managers got a chance to analyze the effectiveness of a newpromotion, the sale would be over.andP;  Now, the hand-held computers transmitsales data by modem to the marketing experts in Plano, Tex.andP;  &quot;Data that usedto take weeks and even months to pull together is now available in days,&quot;says Holmes.andM;Higher, profits, fewer mistakesandM;Getting information more quickly to marketing analysts often leads to smarterdecisions, producing not only higher profits, but fewer mistakes.andP;  HP'sMcBrien says a worldwide information network, which the company set up tolink its overseas sales offices with marketing managers back home, helped HPavoid a financial catastrophe on a single marketing decision--whether tomarket a word-processing system in Europe.andM;Facing a tight deadline, marketing managers used data sent overnight from anoffice in Stockholm to determine that converting the software into certainforeign languages would prove an enormous waste of money.andP;  The sales datashowed that the targeted countries were standardizing on a different system,a barrier that HP could not overcome.andP;  Says McBrien: &quot;We saved about amillion dollars.&quot;andM;But it is consumer goods manufacturers, most notably food companies, that areusing computers the most for marketing and sales decisions, experts say.andM;For nearly a decade, product managers at companies such as General FoodsU.S.A.andP;  and Procter andamp; Gamble Co. have analyzed sales data gleaned frombarcode readers at supermarkets checkout counters.andP;  Supermarket chains sellthe data to consumer research companies like Nielsen Market Research(Northbrook, Ill.) and Information Resources Inc. (Chicago).andP;  These firmsthen distribute this data (via computer tapes CD-ROMs, or on-line) tomanufacturers, who use it to make sales and marketing decisions.andP;  Before theadvent of scanners, teams of market researchers armed with clipboards andpencils would manually count inventory in stores at selective intervals in aneffort to determine sales volume.andM;&quot;Manufacturers certainly know how much of their own product they sell, butthey can only guess at what the competition sells,&quot; says Robert Bregenzer, asenior vice president at Information Resources.andP;  &quot;So they come to us toprovide them with share information.&quot;andM;In recent years as scanning machines have proliferated in supermarkets, thevolume of data available has increased dramatically, literally by a factor ofabout a thousand, experts say.andP;  Moreover, this huge amount of data--salesfigures on virtually all of the 40,000 items carried by the averagesupermarket--is now available on a weekly basis, rather than monthly orbimonthly.andM;What does it all means?andM;The problem now faced by manufacturers is how to decipher it all.andM;&quot;People in manufacturing companies really didn't understand what a factor ofa thousand meant,&quot; says John Little, professor of marketing science atMassachusetts Institute of Technology.andP;  &quot;They've discovered they don't knowwhat to do with that much data.&quot;andM;Enter new, more-powerful software systems.andP;  Consumer market researchcompanies and other firms, such as Metaphor Computer Systems, in MountainView, Calif., are responding with data-base-analysis systems, some of whichemploy artificial intelligence.andP;  Software that performs &quot;promotion analysis&quot;and &quot;coupon analysis,&quot; for example, can quickly sort through mountains ofdata and tell a product marketing manager exactly how a specific brand isdoing in, say, Detroit or Chicago.andP;  In addition, these new software programscan tell what effect a competitor's coupon is having on sales.andP;  Suchinformation is critical for strategic market planning.andM;&quot;There are a lot of rules of thumb a person applies to analyzing supermarketdata,&quot; says MIT's Little.andP;  &quot;To do it automatically, you've got to have somepretty smart software.&quot;andM;Supermarkets have also begun using specialized sales-analysis programs todetermine not only which products to order and how many, but also where toplace them on the shelves.andM;&quot;We have software that produces 'plan-o-grams',&quot; says Travis Whitlow, salescommunication manager for Nielsen Marketing Research, the Dun andamp; Bradstreetfirm that sells scanned data.andP;  &quot;That's a picture of how the store shelvesshould look, based on sales.&quot;andM;The tip of the icebergandM;Even more sophisticated software is under development.andP;  MIT's Little isworking on a program that will emulate a corporate market analyst.andP;  Theprogram, called Cover Story, will sort through scanned data and generate thesort of report for management by an analyst.andP;  The report will cover suchareas as your market share, an analysis of the competition, a breakdown byregion, and some suggested explanations for big gains or losses.andM;Another version of the program will be geared to the sales force.andP;  It will beable to generate reports for a district sales manager that show highlights ofsales in the district and a competitive analysis broken down by stores.andM;&quot;Yet it's just the tip of the iceberg,&quot; says Little.andP;  &quot;There's an awful lotmore we can do in the sales and marketing areas.&quot;andM;Where, in fact, is all this heading?andM;Computerized couponsandM;&quot;In the future,&quot; says The Yankee Group's Anderson, &quot;You're going to be ableto walk into a Food Fair and pull out a plastic card.&quot;andP;  The card will beinserted into a computerized scanning machine that immediately knows howoften you shop in the store and what products you buy, says Anderson.andP;  Basedon this information, the machine will print out coupons for products that youwould probably be willing to try.andM;When you check out, the scanner will record all of your purchases.andP;  Themanufacturers of each product won't have to wait a week to find out what youbought.andP;  They will receive and analyze the results virtually instantly.andM;How far into the future are we talking about?andP;  Says Anderson: &quot;This will bewidespread in three years.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
