Plane samples with an area of 0.3 x 0.3 x 10 mm were irradiatedwith a 225-MeV electron beam at 100{sup 0}C to a flux of 10{sup 21} cm{sup-2} ({similar_to} 0.4 s.n.a.). The fraction of atomic helium in the samplesamounted to about 2.5 x 10{sup -3}% under these conditions. Some of thesamples were irradiated with {alpha} particles to an atomic fractionof 2 x 10{sup -5} of helium. In order to determine the grain boundaryslip, a portion of the control samples and the irradiated samples weresubjected to electrolytic polishing; metallographic investigations weremade under an MIM-8 microscope. All results were statistically analyzedand the confidence intervals and mean-square deviations were determined.</TEXT></DOC>
