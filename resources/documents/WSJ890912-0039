In the fiscal 1989 first quarter, the maker of management-information software systems had net income of $2.4 million, or 18 cents a share, on revenue of $39.3 million.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, ASK slumped $2.25 to close at $8.375.    The company said revenue for the first quarter ending Sept. 30 will remain level with last year's period. ASK said its firstquarter projections are before the $19 million acquisition of Data 3 Systems Inc., a Santa Rosa, Calif., maker of manufacturing software systems.    ASK said the completion of the acquisition, expected sometime next week, may have a small, positive impact on first-quarter earnings. </TEXT></DOC>
