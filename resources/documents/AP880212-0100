The task of turning a deficit-burdened company, faced with highabsenteeism and low productivity, into a vanguard, highlyprofitable enterprise took nearly 10 years and required massiveannual investments of about $830 million.   At one point, the Italian automaker turned to Col. MoammarGadhafi's Libya for money, but in a sign of financial health itbought back Libya's minority share a decade later and avoided athreat to defense contracts from the United States.   The era of robotics took a heavy toll on the work force.Employment at Fiat auto was cut by nearly half, to 72,000 workersby the end of 1987, from 138,000 nine years earlier, according tofigures given by Italian trade unions to The Associated Press.   By increasing automation, Fiat improved productivity and reducedcosts, ushering in a period of high profit that allowed the Agnellifamily, which controls the company, to expand its financial empireinto telecommunications, insurance, banking and retailing.   Vittorio Ghidella, who became the managing director of Fiat'sauto division in 1978, and Cesare Romiti, who took over as managingdirector of the Fiat group a year later, are unanimously consideredthe architects of the group's impressive recovery.   Given a free hand by Chairman Giovanni Agnelli, whose family hasbeen the controlling Fiat shareholder since his grandfather foundedthe Turin-based company in 1899, Ghidella and Romiti set Fiat'scourse through the end of this century after subduing the toughopposition of the metalworkers union.   Through temporary layoffs of 24,000 workers and the dismissal of61 involved in acts of violence and sabotage inside the factoriesduring disruptive walkouts in 1979-80, Fiat regained ``control ofthe plants and on production,'' Carlo Besuzzo, head of Fiat's workplanning, said in an interview with The Associated Press.   A march by 40,000 foremen and white collar workers, supportingFiat's policy, helped end 35 days of strikes in 1980 and foiled apossible occupation of the plants threatened by the most radicalgroups of strikers, who were openly supported by the CommunistParty.   During the most difficult years of labor tensions, worsened by adrop in demand in the wake of the world oil crisis, Fiat wasburdened with unsold stocks of about 500,000 cars while absenteeismranged from 15 percent to 20 percent.   Ironically, it was in large part the mounting opposition oftrade unions to the traditional and stressful assembly line workthat drove Fiat toward heavy investments in computers and robots.   ``It was a dramatic but unavoidable choice,'' said Besuzzo.``Fiat was the first (European) auto company to brave the risks ofheavy investment in automation. The result was a less expensive andbetter product and, after some years, an impressive economicimprovement.''   At present the Fiat group relies on 1,550 auto robots, or abouthalf the total robots in use in Italy, and Besuzzo says there ismore room for even more advanced automation in the Fiat plants.   ``For sure we have a technological leadership over Japanese andU.S. makers in flexible robotized lines, which can assemble partsof different models. Robots in the spray painting division couldsoon cover 60 percent of the production, up from 40 percent, whilethe percentage of robotized work in assembling parts would rise to25 from 3 percent,'' he said.   Many of the robotic systems have been supplied by Fiat's factoryautomation unit Comau, which has also sold systems to majorEuropean and American auto makers, including Ford and GeneralMotors.   The Tipo, the latest midsized model which is expected to boostFiat's ambitions of becoming Europe's No.1 automaker at the expenseof West Germany's Volkswagen, is being assembled in the factory atCassino, which is Europe's most automated.   The model, unveiled Jan. 26, has a competitive price incomparision with European models of the same class. It required themost expensive investment for a Fiat model _ nearly $1.6 billion.   However, investment in automation has produced highly successfulreturns so far.   Since the beginning of the decade, the Fiat group has nearlydoubled net income from one year to the next.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
