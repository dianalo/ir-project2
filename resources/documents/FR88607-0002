The regulationdescribes the procedures and standards applicable to state member banksdesiring to amortize losses under that statute. It also describes the mannerin which such amortizations are to be done. Title VIII of CEBA requiredregulations implementing Title VIII to be issued not more than 90 daysafter enactment, that is, by November 9, 1987. Therefore, the Board initiallypublished the rule as a final rule effective November 9, 1987, and providedfor reporting on the Call Report beginning December 31, 1987, but allowedinterested parties to comment through December 3, 1987 (52 FR 42087; November3, 1987). The comment period was extended and closed on January 8, 1988(52 FR 46984; December 11, 1987).After consideration of comments received, the Board is making one substantivechange and several technical changes to the rule. The substantive changewould allow eligible state member banks to amortize over a period of upto seven years losses on reappraisal or sale of real or personal propertythat was acquired in connection with a qualified agricultural loan andthat the bank owned on January 1, 1983, or subsequently acquires priorto January 1, 1992. Under the initial rule, such property had to be currentlyowned. The technical changes clarify the regulatory definition of ``qualifiedagricultural loan'' and add a definition for ``agriculturally-related otherproperty.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> The rule is retroactively effective to November9, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Rhoger H Pugh, Manager (202)728-5883, Stanley B.

In order tocomply with this requirement, the Board initially published this rule asa final rule effective November 9, 1987, and provided for reporting onthe Call Report beginning December 31, 1987, but allowed interested partiesto comment through December 3, 1987 (52 FR 42087; November 3, 1987). Thecomment period was extended and closed on January 8, 1988 (52 FR 46984;December 11, 1987). The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (``OCC'')and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'') proposed substantiallyidentical regulations containing only technical variations necessary toaccommodate their own regulatory and organizational systems and requestedcomments on their rules as well. The standards to be applied by the Board,the OCC, and the FDIC are the same, however.After consideration of the comments it received, the Board is making onesubstantive change and several technical changes to the rule. The substantivechange would allow eligible state member banks to amortize over a periodof up to seven years losses on reappraisal or sale of real or personalproperty that was acquired in connection with a qualified agriculturalloan and that the bank owned on January 1, 1983, or subsequently acquiresprior to January 1, 1992. Under the initial rule, such property had tobe owned on November 9, 1987, to qualify. This amendment is retroactivelyeffective to November 9, 1987. The technical changes amend the definitionof ``qualified agricultural loan'' to clarify that the Board intends toconstrue the phrase broadly and add a definition of ``agriculturally-relatedother property'' to clarify the treatment of losses due to reappraisalsand sales of such property.The statute allows amortization for agricultural loan losses that wouldbe reflected on annual financial statements for 1984-1991. It also allowsamortization for losses resulting from reappraisals on real or personalproperty acquired in connection with making an agricultural loan that thebank would otherwise be required to show on its annual financial statements.To ensure that losses due to reappraisals are treated comparably to loanlosses, the regulation requires that losses from reappraisals that thebank would be required to reflect on financial statements for 1983-1991will be allowed a seven year amortization period in the same manner asagricultural loan losses generally, i.e., they must be fully amortizedby 1998. For the same reason, the regulation provides that losses resultingfrom reappraisals after 1991 are not eligible for amortization.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments Received</ITAG>Sixteen commenters submitted twenty-one comments on the Board's rule. Seventeencomments addressed the substance of the rule, and the remaining four commentsconcerned the extension of the original comment period. Comments were receivedfrom six banks, four banking trade associations (two national and two state-level),four Reserve Banks, one law firm, and the Financial Accounting StandardsBoard (``FASB''). Additionally, Board staff and FDIC staff met with representativesof the two national trade associations commenting (the American BankersAssociation (``ABA'') and the Independent Bankers Association of America(``IBAA'')) on December 11, 1987, after the associations asked for clarificationof the rule as published. Subsequent to the meeting, the IBAA and the ABAeach submitted a substantive written comment on the rule.General CommentsFour banks submitted comments supporting the rule, and three of these suggestedthat the Board liberalize certain of its provisions. A fifth bank opposedthe rule because it does not believe it is prudent to give special treatmentto classes of loans when such treatment results in false statements ofavailable capital. Four trade associations (two state and two federal)submitted written comments generally supporting the rule and suggestingchanges to it. Four Federal Reserve banks commented favorably on the rulealthough several expressed reservations about the advisability of the statutoryprogram itself and asked about administrative procedures. The comment fromthe law firm favoring the proposal was extensively paraphrased in one ofthe bank comments favoring the proposal and suggesting substantive changesto the portion of the rule concerning amortization of losses related toreal estate sales or reappraisals.Specific Comments <T3>The FASB Comment.</T3> The FASB comment criticized the practice establishedby Title VIII of the CEBA of allowing banks to amortize loan losses ratherthan recognizing the losses when they are taken. It voiced a concern overyet another difference between regulatory reporting standards and generallyaccepted accounting principals and believes such differences only serveto confuse and mislead shareholders and financial analysts. The FASB commentsuggested that agricultural loan problems could be treated more effectivelyby modifying the regulatory prescriptions of acceptable capital ratherthan adding lines to regulator financial statements. Regardless of whetherthe Board agrees with the FASB approach, Title VIII of the CEBA explicitlyrequires the approach embodied in the rule. <T3>Definition of ``agricultural bank.''</T3> Section 208.15(a)(1) definesan agricultural bank as any bank: (A) With FDIC insured deposits; (B) locatedin an area of the country with an economy dependent on agriculture; (C)with total assets of $100 million or less; and (D) with at least 25 percentof its total loans in qualified agricultural loans or with less than 25percent of its total loans in qualified agricultural loans but which theBoard, appropriate Reserve Bank, or state regulator still recommends tothe FDIC as eligible. The definition of an agricultural bank includes the statutory requirementthat the bank have total assets of $100 million or less. Comments werereceived suggesting that the regulators clarify what happens if a bankis approved for loss deferral and subsequently exceeds the size limitation.While Congress did not intend for banks larger than $100 million in assetsto defer loan losses under the program, it is of little value to a memberbank to defer a loss one year if it must reverse that deferral the nextyear because it grows to over $100 million in assets. Therefore, the Boardexpects a member bank to meet the definition of an agricultural bank, includingthe size limitation, upon initial application and as of every quarter endthat new agricultural loan losses are to be deferred. Once admitted tothe program, any loss which was properly deferred will be allowed to amortizedaccording to the regulation regardless of the bank's size, but new lossescan be amortized only if the bank has assets of less than $100 million.On the other hand, the Board does not intend to allow member banks to bypassthe application/review process through a merger with another bank whichhas already received program approval. Conversely, the merger of two bankswhich are both in the program could result in a participating bank withover $100 million in assets. Because mergers are not expected to be frequent,the status of loss deferral subsequent to a merger will be determined ona case-by-case basis. State member banks should discuss their loss deferralstatus with their Reserve Bank.One bank and the IBAA urged that the Federal Reserve be liberal when itdetermines whether a bank meets the 25 percent test because prudent banksmay have charged off substantial amounts of such loans but, due to thedepressed agricultural economy, may not have been able to replace suchloans with new agricultural loans. The bank commenting suggested usinga pre-charge-off measure of agricultural loan values to prevent failureto qualify because of the depressed value of collateral or the smallersize of loans made to the depressed agricultural sector. The IBAA suggestedthat a bank should satisfy the test if at any time since December 31, 1983,it met the test.The Board does not believe such a change is necessary as the rule doesnot establish the 25 percent test as an absolute requirement. Thus, factorssuch as depressed collateral value or lack of prudent agricultural lendingopportunities will be considered when applications for loan loss amortizationare reviewed to ensure that this arbitrary limit alone is not the reasona bank cannot participate. Further, Title VIII of CEBA was directed towardbanks with a continuing commitment to agriculture, and given the broaddefinition of ``agricultural loan'' in the regulation, a bank otherwisequalifying under the program should have no difficulty satisfying thistest.Some commenters also urged that the Board list specific criteria to identifyagricultural areas. As it did when considering the initial rule, the Boardconcluded that the normal means of identifying agricultural areas_incomelevels, revenue flows, acreage in production_are abnormally depressed dueto the current state of the agricultural economy. Furthermore, adoptinga list of acceptable counties or geographic regions might leave the erroneousimpression that a bank located outside such an arbitrary area could notqualify even though it might otherwise qualify as an ``agricultural bank,''just as the relatively low level of farm income compared to other incomemight artificially mask local areas that traditional are dependent uponagriculture but currently have a depressed level of income from agriculture.Consequently, each application should include a description of the bank'slocation, dominant lines of commerce in its service area, and any otherinformation the bank believes will support the contention that it is locatedin an agricultural area.<T3>Definition of ``qualified agricultural loan.'' </T3>Under section 801of Title VIII of the CEBA,<ITAG tagnum="21">The term ``qualified agricultural loan'' means a loan made to financethe production of agricultural products or livestock in the United States,a loan secured by farmland or farm machinery, or such other category ofloans as the appropriate Federal banking agency may deem eligible.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Section 208.15(a)(2) of the Board's rule defines a qualified agriculturalloan to include any loan qualifying as ``loans to finance agriculturalproduction and other loans to farmers'' or as ``loans secured by farm land''for purposes of Schedule RC-C of the FFIEC Consolidated Report of Condition.The definition also includes other loans and leases that the applying bankproves to be sufficiently related to agriculture to qualify in the opinionof the bank's Reserve Bank.These Call Report definitions are virtually identical to those containedin Title VIII of the CEBA but are more comprehensive and permit the agenciesto use the Call Reports as the predominant monitoring device for the amortizationprogram. Therefore, the Board initially saw no reason to repeat the definitionin the statute when the regulatory definition was of a more descriptivenature and referred to Call Report terms with which member banks are familiar.Additionally, as suggested by Title VIII of the CEBA, the Board retaineddiscretion to deem other types of loans and leases to be ``qualified''and to recommend them to the FDIC as eligible if the requesting bank demonstratesthose assets to be sufficiently related to agriculture.Three banks and three trade associations commented on this provision. Onebank suggested that the regulation treat any loan made by an agriculturalbank as an agricultural loan because such banks as a practical matter onlymake agricultural and agriculturally-related loans. Another bank suggestedthat loans to farm equipment suppliers be specifically mentioned in therule. The Independent Bankers Association of Minnesota and the third banknoted that the statute mentions farm machinery loans specifically whilethe rule does not and suggested that the rule include this category ofloans. The third bank and the three trade associations suggest that theBoard provide examples of others types of loans that would be consideredas agriculturally-related loans.In order to clarify that the regulatory definition of ``qualified agriculturalloan'' is as broad as the statutory definition and is not intended to limitthe types of loans which a member bank may include in an application, thestatutory phrases referring to farm machinery loans will be added to theregulatory definition. Member banks should refer to the ``Line Item Instructionsfor the Consolidated Report of Condition (``Call Report'')'' for ScheduleRC-C for an indication of the other types of loans that will be consideredas qualifying for amortization. For example, qualified agricultural loanswould include loans reported under line item 1(b)_loans secured by farmland(land known to be used or usable for agricultural purposes, such as cropand stock production, grazing or pasture land, whether tillable or notand whether wooded or not). Similarly, loans reported under line item 3would qualify. Such loans would include loans to finance agricultural production(such as for growing or sorting crops, or breeding, raising, fattening,or marketing livestock), or for purchases of farm machinery, equipment,or implements. Consistent with the congressional intent, the definitionson the Call Report are not necessarily exclusive descriptions of eligibleloans. If a member bank believes that a loan was made for an agriculturalpurpose, it may apply to amortize it even though the loan was not reportedon the Call Report as an agricultural loan. A determination will be madeon a case-by-case basis on whether each loan qualifies.<T3>Amortization. </T3>Section 208.15(b)(2) provides that amortizationof each qualified agricultural loan shall be computed over a period notto exceed seven years on a quarterly, straight-line basis commencing withthe first quarter after the loan was or is charged off so that each loanis fully amortized not later than December 31, 1988. Thus, loans writtenoff in accounting periods ending prior to the adoption of the rule canbe amortized <T3>pro rata </T3>beginning with the Call Report for December 31, 1987.Two state trade associations, the IBAA, and one bank believe that the bank,rather than the Federal Reserve, should decide whether the full seven yearamortization period will be used. The IBAA also believes that adoptingthe <T3>pro rata </T3>treatment of loans written down prior to adoption ofthe rule unfairly penalizes banks that were diligent in adjusting theirassets.Under the initial rule, a bank that wishes to use an amortization scheduleshorter than the maximum seven years is free to apply to do so. The ruleanticipates that a seven year schedule will be the normal schedule butdoes not require its use. The decision to permit the use of a shorter amortizationperiod will depend upon the applicant bank's financial position and isnot likely to require consideration of any extraordinary issues.With regard to adopting a <T3>pro rata </T3>treatment of loans written down prior to adoption ofthe rule, the Board does not believe it unfairly penalizes banks that werediligent in adjusting their assets. Accepted banking practice and CallReport instructions require member banks to record a loss in the periodit becomes apparent.<T3>Losses due to real estate sales or reappraisals. </T3>Section 208.15(b)(1)(ii)allows a bank to amortize any loss reflected in its financial statementsresulting from a reappraisal or sale of real or personal property it acquiredin connection with a qualified agricultural loan and that it owned on January1, 1983, and still held on November 9, 1987, and of any additional propertyacquired on or before December 31, 1998.A law firm and a bank submitting substantially similar letters, the IndependentBankers of Minnesota, and the IBAA objected to the requirement that suchproperty had to be held on November 9, 1987, in order for any such lossesto be eligible for amortizing. Comments pointed out that neither the statutenor its legislative history explicitly calls for ownership of such propertyon the effective date of the regulation and suggested that better referencedates might be the date the loss was actually recognized or the date thelegislation was introduced, passed both houses of Congress, or was signed.The Independent Bankers of Minnesota suggested that any loss on such propertybe treated in the same manner as the loss on the loan it secured, thatis, amortization should be allowed at least beginning with the date theloss was recognized so long as the loss is otherwise an eligible loss.One of the reasons Congress authorized in Title VIII of CEBA the deferralof reappraisal losses was to remove the accounting pressure to sell suchproperty into already weak markets. This is not a factor if the propertyhas already been sold. In addition, unlike unsold property, charged-offloans still evidence a legal obligation to pay which might still have somevalue. With regard to losses resulting from sales, Congress did not mentiondeferral at all. Losses on sales were authorized in the regulation merelyto make unnecessary the expense of a reappraisal immediately before a salesolely to allow the economic loss to qualify for deferral as a loss onreappraisal rather than be recognized as a loss on a sale. For these reasons,the initial rule did not provide for amortization of losses from reappraisedor sold property not owned on or after November 9, 1987. After consultation among the federal banking regulatory agency staffs,reconsideration of the initial rule, and consideration of pending applicationsand the comments received, the Board concluded that requiring real propertyto be owned on or after November 9, 1987, does not necessarily accomplishthe goal Congress sought to achieve (that is, avoiding the forced saleof real property into depressed markets simply to qualify the losses onsuch a sale for amortization under the program). Thus, the rule is beingamended retroactively to November 9, 1987, to remove this requirement.This change represents the only substantive change to the rule. <T3>In need of capital.</T3> Title VIII of the CEBA provides that a bankmust be in need of capital restoration. The legislative history of theprovision indicates that Congress intended that only banks with capitalin need of restoration be permitted to amortize losses. Further, it intendedthat only banks with reasonable prospects for survival be permitted toamortize losses. Section 208.15(d)(2) of the rule provides that the currentcapital of a bank wishing to amortize qualifying loans must be in needof restoration although the bank remains an economically viable, fundamentallysound institution. Two state-level trade associations believed that this section is too restrictive.Both commenters believed that any bank qualifying as an agricultural bankwhich has qualifying agricultural loan losses should be able to amortizethose losses to restore capital to some higher level even if it is not``in need of'' capital restoration for regulatory purposes. The IndependentBankers of Minnesota also stated that the requirement that a bank mustbe economically viable and fundamentally sound to be eligible is unnecessary.The ABA explicitly asked that the capital level after adjustment be usedwhen measuring compliance with lending limits based on a percentage ofcapital.The Board has concluded, as it did when it issued its initial rule, thatno purpose would be served by allowing an otherwise insolvent institutionto avoid insolvency through the use of this accounting adjustment. Whethera particular member bank is ``in need of'' capital restoration may dependon its particular circumstances, however. Because the Federal Reserve willmake the determination of need in each case, a member bank applying toamortize agricultural loans should include a statement as to why it is``in need of'' capital restoration. There remains the question of removing a bank from the program once ithas recovered financially. As a matter of administrative practice, theBoard does not intend to remove such a bank from the program so long asthe bank continues to meet the conditions on acceptance prescribed in theregulation. Therefore, once a loan loss has been deferred, a bank willhave the option to continue to amortize it over the period provided forin the regulation. However, once the bank has recovered sufficiently sothat it no longer meets eligibility requirements because it no longer is``in need of'' capital restoration, no new deferral of loan losses willbe permitted. <T3>Other Issues. </T3>Several commenters suggested that the regulationclarify what would constitute evidence of fraud which would disqualifya loan from amortization. The Board decided not to attempt to list whatwould constitute fraud in the regulation. An indicium of fraud might includea criminal referral report, for example, but lack of such a report willnot preclude excluding a loan if evidence of fraud is uncovered duringthe application process. Normal sources of information used to determinewhether fraud is present should include information collected in the examinationprocess as well. Using this case-by-case approach will allow an applyingbank an opportunity to explain ambiguous circumstances. The rule requires a certification by the bank's chief executive officerthat there is no evidence that the loss resulted from fraud or criminalabuse. One commenter expressed concern over this requirement because noone could be absolutely certain in every case that fraud did not exist.The Board appreciates that proving without doubt that fraud does not existin each case may be impossible. The Board believes, however, that certifying``on knowledge and belief'' that fraud does not exist is acceptable.Several commenters also suggested removing references to enforcement proceedingsand to compensation levels from the regulation. The presence of such referencesonly affirms that the program will be monitored and managed through anagreement between a participating bank and its Reserve Bank and does notcreate information requirements or performance obligations not alreadyattaching through the agreement itself.<ITAG tagnum="84">Information Collection</ITAG>These amendments to the procedures and standards applicable to participationin the agricultural loan loss deferral program accordingly amend the informationrequirements of the proposal submitted by banks desiring to participatein the program provided for in the Report by Banks Proposing to AmortizeLosses on Qualified Agricultural Loans (FR 4020; OMB No. 7100-0226). Thisinformation collection was approved by the Board under delegated authorityfrom the Office of Management and Budget on October 28, 1987. It specifiesthe information required to establish and document the bank's eligibilityto participate in the program including provision of details of the loanson which the bank proposes to amortize losses, of a capital restorationplan, and other necessary information. The information requirements ofthe FR 4020 proposal to participate are those specified to meet the requirementsof the regulation and are thus now amended to reflect the changes in theregulation. No change will be required in the items collecting informationon agricultural loan loss deferral on the Report of Condition and Income(FFIEC 034; OMB No. 7100-0036).<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354,5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Board certifies that the amendments will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.The amendments would not have any effect on many depository institutions,and any adverse impact on small depositories affected (which only occursif an institution chooses to take advantage of this regulation) would likelybe outweighed by the benefits bestowed by the regulation on these smalldepository institutions.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 208</ITAG>Banks, banking, State member banks, Applications, Recordkeeping, Floodinsurance, Capital, Securities.Pursuant to the Board's authority under Title VIII of the Competitive EqualityBanking Act of 1987 (Pub.
