<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-18-1027 </DOCNO><TEXT>There is an increasing interest in combined cycle systems. The potentialof these systems in future power generation planning has been studied.Therefore the Electric Generation Expansion Analysis System (EGEAS) isused. EGEAS involves planning analyses using of three optimization structures:linear programming, dynamic programming, and generalized Bender's decomposition.In order to evaluate the Gas turbine combined cycle system (GTCC) technologywithin a range of utility environments, The EPRI (Electric Power ResearchInstitute)-developed Regional Utility Systems are used. These systemsprovide scaled-down models of existing capacity and load duration curvesas well as fuel price regimes for each of six continental US regions.The status of combined cycle R and D is briefly reviewed. Methods toreduce combustion irreversibility and to fight the problem of availabilityloss in heat transfer are mentioned. Two energy saving projects are discussed:the Japanese Moonlight Project reheat gas turbine combined cycle powerplant and the steam-cooled reheat gas turbine cycle proposed by Rice.Some important advances of the combined cycle system technology are given.Whether methane will become the dominant energy source depends on itsavailability and progress in related technologies, one of which - combinedcycle systems - shows great promise. 8 figs., 4 tabs., 13 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
