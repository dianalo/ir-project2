 TrueType is being developed jointly by Microsoft and Apple ComputerInc. as a way to break market-leader Adobe Systems Inc.'s stranglehold onoutline-font technology.andM;Windows 3.0 users have complained that its fonts, which cannot be scaled, areslow to display on-screen and print inconsistently.andM;Windows 3.0 uses bit-mapped fonts, which demand big chunks of hard-disk spacebecause each font in each size must be stored separately on disk.andP;  Outlinefonts, by contrast, can be scaled to any size based on a mathematicaldescription.andM;&quot;The one significant area we didn't enhance when we did 3.0 was the fontarea,&quot; said Rich Abel, group product marketing manager for Windows atMicrosft, in Redmond, Wash.andP;  &quot;Microsoft and other vendors are working toaddress that.&quot;andM;Microsoft officials say the next release of Windows will contain TrueTypefonts.andP;  Although Microsoft officials have said that the new version--referredto as Windows 3.1--wound appear by the end of this year, sources close to thecompany say the release is unlikely until the first quarter of 1991.andP;  Thedelay could be due in part to technical difficulties encountered by Apple andMicrosoft in completing TrueType, according to the sources.andM;However, Windows users will have similar capabilities much sooner fromMicrosoft rival Adobe, which this fall is expected to release a $99 Windowsversion of Adobe Type Manager, an add-in program that supports both screenand printer fonts.andM;Zenographics Inc. is already shipping its $195 SuperPrint, which lets usersoutput scalable PostScript Type 1 fonts to non-PostScript printers such asHewlett-Packard Co.'s LaserJet.andM;&quot;Adobe has done an impressive job porting this product to Windows,&quot; said onedeveloper who has seen the software.andP;  &quot;It will increase the success ofWindows 3.0, but will also lessen the chance that TrueType will becomesuccessful.&quot;andM;Other technologies also are being developed on the object-orientedapplications front.andM;Microsoft is attempting to add to Windows some of the capabilities ofHewlett-Packard's NewWave, such as the concurrent use of word-processing,graphics and other applications on the same document.andM;Microsoft is circulating among developers a proposed standard, called Linkedand Embedded Documents, for working with Windows dynamic data exchange.andO;Products that implement this standard will allow users to crate permanentlinks between data from different applications as well as create compounddocuments, which combine data from several applications while retaining thelinks to the original applications.andM;Several Windows ISVs are developing similar capabilities.andP;  Micrografx Inc.andO;and Samna Corp. have jointly created the Intelligent Snapshot Driver.andP;  Thisspecification defines standard graphics code that developers can incorporateinto their graphics applications.andP;  Other products using the same code will beable to display the same graphics flawlessly.andM;In the past, Microsoft officials have said they would turn Windows and OS/2into fully object-oriented operating systems that would include anobject-oriented file system that allows compound documents to be spreadacross multiple storage devices and allow for sophisticated data sharingbetween documents.andP;  Although some hints of this technology are beginning toappear, many observers believe that a fully implemented object-orientedsystem will not appear for years.andM;After initially balking, Microsoft is also working to allow Expanded-MemorySpecification emulators and applications that use DPS extenders to work withthe protected modes of Windows 3.0.andM;In developing the advanced memory-management capabilities of Windows 3.0,Microsoft released an environment that cannot run these packages in a waythat optimizes the memory and multitasking capabilities of hardware.andM;However, after outcries from the huge installed base of users and vendors ofthese packages, Microsoft relented and is now working to allow the softwareto run fully under the next version of Windows.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
