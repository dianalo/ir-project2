The lesson, which should not be lost on a watchingworld, is not that arms control worked but that containmentworked. A hostile power kept in check eventually forswore itsexpansionist ambitions, and the West could take a stepforward to a world built on Western principles of liberaldemocracy.   Indeed, Mr. Bush's unilateral decision to wind down theAmerican inventory of tactical nuclear weapons makesstunningly clear that arms-control agreements are anirrelevant distraction. The United States hasn't neededarms-control agreements with Britain, France or Germany. Itmost likely will not need them with the new nations ofEastern Europe or the Soviet republics. And no agreement islikely to control pirate nations such as Saddam Hussein'sIraq, which even now flouts its agreements with the U.N. Thekey, forgotten in the last hours of the Gulf War, ispolitical change.</LP><TEXT>   The war with Iraq provided another lesson keenly relevantto Mr. Bush's announcement. In a world in which it ispossible to defeat a hostile power by deliveringcomputer-guided, conventional munitions to precise targets,nuclear weapons lose their importance. The nukes would haveindiscriminately obliterated whole populations; smart weaponsminimize civilian damage. This was clear in theory years ago,when the U.S. &quot;smart&quot; weapons systems were under development.Yet arms-control enthusiasts opposed the precision weaponsthat now make their goals feasible.   Their fear was that precise weapons could be used withoutblowing up the world. They had tied themselves to &quot;mutualassured destruction,&quot; hoping to avoid war by ensuring that ifit came millions of civilians would die. Indeed, it stretchesthe point only slightly to suggest that the political purposeof the tactical weapons Mr. Bush is now removing was toensure that any European War would turn into aSoviet-American nuclear exchange.   Yet the Democratic party's most liberal wing and itssupporters in the Washington arms-control community areasserting that Mr. Bush is merely embracing positions theyadvocated years ago. In fact, the positions made no sensethen, before containment had succeeded. They are feasible nowbecause of the political changes in the Soviet Union broughtabout by policies arms control advocates opposed, the Reagandefense build-up in particular.   This point will be especially pertinent to the new debateover defense policy. In dropping tactical nuclear weapons,President Bush stressed the necessity to go ahead with thestrategic defense initiative and the B-2 Stealth bomber.These systems are ideally tailored to the kind of militarythreat we are likely to face after the Cold War, exemplifiedby Saddam's drive for nuclear terror. SDI provides theability to both defend our populations against the mostlikely modes of future attack, while the B-2 provides asurvivable offensive capability that stays home and operatesunder human control (you can call back a plane).   Yet it's clear that both SDI and the B-2 will be swept upin the wave of mindless defense cutting now being bruitedabout by the Democratic left. If the public believes that Mr.Bush is doing the right thing in cutting back the nucleararsenal, it's going to have to provide support for his plansto defend the future. A world without tactical nukes, butdefended by SDI and the B-2 is worth a great deal ofpolitical capital. Without SDI, U.S. response to a new threatsometime in the next generation would almost necessarily beoverdue and hasty, at enormous danger, cost and waste.   We are not out of the woods yet. For example, the nuclearinitiative itself adds a new and complicated dimension to thefault lines in the internal politics of the Soviet Union. Mr.Gorbachev competes for authority with Mr. Yeltsin and theleaders of the republics, notably Ukraine and Khazakistan,compete with both of them. The republics worry that Russiancontrol of nuclear weapons now on their soil will be used aspolitical leverage against them. If the republics come to seeMr. Bush's initiative as another U.S. attempt to tilt controlback to the center and Mr. Gorbachev, they will resist,further destabilizing the country's domestic politics.   Without question, 1991 is emerging as a seminal year inhistory. Much of the world has passed from totalitarianism todemocracy, and now embarks on the path away from the totalwar of offensive nuclear weapons and toward defensivesystems. The future can be brighter still, so long as weremember why we have succeeded thus far.</TEXT></DOC>
