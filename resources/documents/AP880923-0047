The Republican presidential nominee, in a speech Thursday to aGOP fund-raiser in Houston, said he would seek to ``maximize thevalue of our military investments'' through the more efficient useof ``existing weapons systems and those in the pipeline now.''   Bush was taking a break from debate preparations today to hold aprivate meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said the session withShevardnadze will give the vice president ``a chance to look aheada little bit.''   ``This is an area where I think Americans don't want to changecourse,'' Fuller told reporters aboard Air Force Two. ``I think itshould be seen as an opportunity for George Bush to build on therecord'' of the Reagan administration.   On Thursday, Bush told a GOP fund-raiser that it was notnecessary to ``match the Soviets bullet for bullet and tank fortank.''   The vice president shared the stage at the $1,000 a persongathering with President Reagan, who told the audience thatDemocrats ``use our words and borrow our tunes, but the song is wayout of key.'' The banquet generated about $3.1 million, said Bushspokeswoman Sheila Tate.   In his speech, Bush did not elaborate on the defense plan, butaides said that the vice president's ``Competitive StrategiesInitiative,'' to be outlined in greater detail over the next fewdays by Bush and Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, would involve ashifting of strategies to deal more effectively with the defense ofEurope.   The move could mean a reduction of U.S. troops overseas in thefuture as other, high-technology weapons systems are pressed intoservice, the aides said.   Modernization of conventional forces has been a major proposalof Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis. The program also has beenunder review at the Defense Department, Bush aides said.   Bush was to continuing preparing today for Sunday's nationallytelevised debate with Dukakis and had no events scheduled after themorning meeting with the Soviet foreign minister.   With just days to go to the showdown, Bush forces sought tothrow Dukakis off guard with a blitz into his backyard Thursday tocollect an endorsement from the Boston Police Patrolmen'sAssociation.   Bush called the endorsement ``a great boost'' even as Dukakissupporters staged counter-rallies outside and on the steps of theMassachusetts Statehouse.   ``Who was it who said, the police aren't there when you needthem? They're wrong,'' Bush said at the event, which aides saidwould be highlighted in a forthcoming Bush campaign commercial.   Later in Houston, Bush told the GOP banquet, ``the differencesbetween me and the governor of Massachusetts couldn't be moreclear. I am the one with the Texas values.''   Asked if Bush's remarks about conventional forces could suggesta movement toward reducing the number of U.S. troops in Europe,Bush spokeswoman Alixe Glen said, ``It could. It could mean therewould be less emphasis on that.''   However, she said that the initiative did not automatically meanthat Bush favored such a reduction.   Dennis Ross, Bush's foreign policy adviser, said that theproposal was not intended to signal support for a troop reductionand ``is simply a new management process for spending our moneysmarter in new weapons systems of the future.''</TEXT></DOC>
