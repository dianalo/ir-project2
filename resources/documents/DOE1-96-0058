Severalmajor issues are picked out here which emerged during this process, onwhich further thought and action could bring immense national benefitsboth within and beyond the field of nuclear power. These issues includethe lack of a systematic methodology for balancing safety and cost duringplant design; the inability of many engineers to explain their subjectlucidly and persuasively to the public, politicians and their fellowprofessionals; the inconsistent and uncoordinated involvement of numerousgovernmental departments in nuclear safety matters, compounded by lackof parliamentary scrutiny and approval of safety standards; the prolongedrecord of inefficient management in earlier projects, especially theadvanced gas-cooled reactors before Heysham II and Torness; and the lackof an coherent plan by industry to gain maximum benefit from the pressurizedwater reactor programme. In each case, professional engineers and theirprofessional societies have both the opportunity and the responsibilityto initiate changes from which the nation would benefit for many years.</TEXT></DOC>
