But Cornell staff may not be able to determine if Robert T.Morris Jr., a graduate student in the university's computer scienceprogram, was the source of the virus, M. Stuart Lynn, vice presidentof information technologies at Cornell, said at a news conferencetoday in Ithaca, N.Y.   Three sources with detailed knowledge of the case told The NewYork Times that Morris, 23, whom friends describe as ``brilliant,''devised the virus as an experiment.   Cornell officials did not suspect the virus may have originatedin their computer system until reporters asked questions Fridaynight after the Times report was published, Lynn said.   ``We are investigating his computer files at Cornell, and so farwe have determined that his account contains files that appear tohold passwords for some computers at Cornell and Stanford to whichhe is not entitled,'' lynn said. ``We also have discovered thatMorris' account contains a list of passwords substantially similarto those found in the virus.''   Passwords are the codes needed to gain access to computer systems.   The student's father, Robert Morris Sr., is chief scientist atthe National Computer Security Center in Bethesda, Md., the arm ofthe National Security Agency devoted to protecting computers fromoutside attack. He has written widely on the security of the Unixoperating system, the computer master program that was the target ofthe computer virus.   The elder Morris, reached today at his home in Arnold, Md., saidhis son would not be available for comment until next week.   Computer viruses behave like biological viruses in that theyduplicate themselves and spread from computer to computer, through``electronic mail'' systems or other networks. They consume computerprocessing power and storage space, and some _ but apparently notthis one _ destroy stored information.   The virus was introduced into Arpanet, a Department of Defensecomputer network linking universities, research centers and defenseoperations, officials said. It was intended to remain thereundetected, slowly making copies that would move from computer tocomputer, the Times said.   But a design error caused it instead to replicate out of control,the Times reported Friday, quoting an anonymous caller to thenewspaper who said he was an associate of the program's designer.   The virus jammed more than 6,000 computers nationwide startingWednesday. But it apparently caused no damage other than lostresearch time and the thousands of costly hours that computerscientists and programmers were spending to remove it from theirsystems. By Friday, most universities and research centers hadturned their computers back on.   George Strawn, director of the Computation Center at Iowa StateUniversity in Des Moines, described the impact of the virus at hisschool as ``a slight case of the sniffles.''   Doug Van Houweling, vice provost for information technology atthe University of Michigan, said no files were damaged but manyhours of work were needed to clean out ``duplicate waste files'' thevirus created.   Hans-Werner Braun, a computer expert at the Ann Arbor, Mich.,school, said the main effect of the incident was to call attentionto the system's vulnerability.   The elder Morris told the Times that the virus ``has raised thepublic awareness to a considerable degree. It is likely to makepeople more careful and more attentive to vulnerabilities in thefuture.''   Sources told the Times that his son flew to Washington on Fridayand planned to hire a lawyer and meet with officials in charge ofthe Arpanet network to discuss the incident.   Computer scientists said the younger Morris worked in recentsummers at the American Telephone and Telegraph Co.'s BellLaboratories. One of his projects included rewriting thecommunications security software for most computers that run theUnix operating system, which ATandamp;T developed, the Times reported.   Computer scientists who are disassembling the virus to learn howit worked said they have been impressed with its power andcleverness.   The elder Morris, 56, told the Times that it was ``the work of abored graduate student.''   Dexter Kozen, the graduate faculty representative in Cornell'scomputer science department, said he chuckled when he heard thatquote.   ``We try to keep them from getting bored,'' he said. ``I guess wedidn't try hard enough.''</TEXT></DOC>
