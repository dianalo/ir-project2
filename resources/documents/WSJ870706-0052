America is starting to reverse the trend of the past five years, during which the nation consumed an increasingly greater amount than it produced and imported an increasingly greater amount than it exported. This reversal process is evoking huzzahs and headlines. In his June 27 radio address, President Reagan declared: &quot;The improvement in the trade deficit, which we've been talking about for several months, is now being certified on the front pages of many of our nation's newspapers.&quot;    But however welcome it is, this process may entail a sharp deceleration in Americans' standard of living. As Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker observed at a private gathering several months ago, most nations encumbered by huge trade deficits undergo wrenching readjustments.    &quot;The usual way,&quot; Mr. Volcker rumbled, &quot;is what Mr. Alfred Kahn used to call a banana.&quot; The Fed chief was referring to a recession, of course; Mr. Kahn, a Carter administration economist, substituted the word banana after the White House objected to his public utterances about recessions.    At the moment, a banana doesn't seem imminent. The economy is plugging along with few signs of strain. The trade deficit does appear to be narrowing, thanks to the lower dollar making American products more competitive on world markets. The result is a less lopsided expansion, in which manufacturing industries are slowly returning to health.    That's the good side of the economy's transition. But restoring the balance between consumption and production, and between imports and exports, will involve &quot;one of the most difficult economic and financial maneuvers ever attempted,&quot; says Fed Governor H. Robert Heller.    One big question is whether the trade deficit will narrow rapidly enough to maintain world confidence in the dollar. If it doesn't, foreign investors will balk at continuing to lend the money needed to bridge the gap between what the U.S. sells and buys abroad. Interest rates will then rise, threatening the expansion. The U.S. got a taste of this sort of crisis during the spring, when the dollar plummeted and rates rose.    In speeches and in congressional testimony, Mr. Volcker has been pointing out the difficulties of bringing the trade gap down. &quot;Suppose we succeed in balancing our trade account in five years -- an improvement of about $150 billion,&quot; he says. This probably means that &quot;our manufacturing output will have to rise about 15%&quot; to generate sufficient exports, &quot;on top of normal growth of say another 15% to meet the needs of a growing domestic economy.&quot;    Such a pace of industrial production exceeds anything the U.S. has sustained for a long time, and &quot;we are not investing in industry at a rate to support that growth,&quot; Mr. Volcker warns. The strains on U.S. capacity, he adds, could rekindle inflation.    The risks of an economic collapse rise substantially if U.S. trading partners -- especially the two biggest, Japan and West Germany -- don't grow fast enough to buy more American-made goods and services. And the risks are heightened if the U.S. government doesn't cut its budget deficit. Without a reduction in federal borrowing, the U.S. will find itself lacking the resources necessary to finance domestic economic growth if and when the foreign money flowing into the country dries up.    Almost by definition, the shift to a more production-oriented, less consumption-oriented economy will curb the rise in Americans' living standards. U.S. consumers will enjoy a shrinking percentage of the goods and services traded among nations, and a larger share of American-made goods will be shipped abroad. Billions of dollars will also be diverted from the domestic economy in order to pay interest and dividends on the enormous sums now owed to foreigners as a result of the accumulated trade deficits. The average American will face higher prices for imported goods as a result of the lower dollar, a loss for which he &quot;will have no offsetting increase in purchasing power,&quot; said Alan Greenspan, the incoming Fed chairman, in a recent interview.    Sure enough, evidence of a slowdown in living standards is starting to emerge. Robert Barbera, chief economist at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., observes that the U.S. &quot;appears to be reversing {the} trend&quot; of late 1982 through the second quarter of 1986, when consumer spending rose at a hefty annualized rate of about 4.3% -- well above the growth rate for U.S. output. This year, wages and salaries have risen only about enough to keep pace with inflation, Mr. Barbera adds. &quot;Not surprisingly, consumer spending has been sluggish.&quot;    Whether American consumers will be content with &quot;sluggish&quot; remains to be seen. At least it's better than a banana. </TEXT></DOC>
