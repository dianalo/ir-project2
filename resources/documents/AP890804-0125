COLEMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A thunderstorm doused sections of northeasternIllinois with up to 5 inches of rain Friday, flooding roads,causing widespread power outages and forcing the evacuation ofhundreds of patients from a flooded hospital.   Doctors, nurses and ambulance crews worked Friday night todischarge or transfer to other hospitals about 300 patients fromResurrection Medical Center, a 434-bed hospital on Chicago'sNorthwest Side.   The hospital's basement was flooded and the ground floor wasankle-deep in water at one point, officials said. Patients had nohot water or hot food because of the flooding.   Firefighters were working to pump out water from the basementand sub-basement, said hospital spokeswoman Janice Youngwith.   More than 50,000 Commonwealth Edison customers lost electricityat the storm's peak between 4 a.m. and 4:30 a.m., said utilityspokesman Mike Kelly. By early afternoon, all but 100 or 200 hadpower back.   ``We're down to just a mop-up operation,'' Kelly said.   In the area near O'Hare International Airport, ``we got justabout our entire total normal monthly rainfall for August,'' in thedownpour, said Richard Koeneman, a forecaster with the NationalWeather Service in Chicago.   O'Hare got 3.45 inches of rain between 1:30 a.m. and 6:30 a.m.,he said. The total normal rainfall for August in the area is 3.53inches.   Flash flood warings went up for northern Kane, Du Page and Cookcounties, as well as De Kalb County.   The Edens Expressway was closed near Winnetka after 6 a.m. andremained closed until about 10:30 a.m., frustrating commuters, saidIllinois Department of Transportation dispatchers.   Public safety officers used an inflatable dinghy to rescue a manwho was stranded knee-deep in water on the top of his submerged caron the expressway under an overpass in suburban Northfield, saidPaul Harlow, deputy chief of public safety in Glencoe.   Power outages hit the northern suburbs the hardest, followed byChicago's north side and the western suburbs, said CommonwealthEdison spokesman Jose Andrade.   Crews in trucks were hampered by street flooding, he said.   The heaviest part of the storm swept a 20-mile-wide band on aline from Elgin through Arlington Heights to Evanston, Koenemansaid.   Three to five inches of rain fell in the hardest-hit areas, hesaid. But the rains hit a relatively small region, and ``people wholive to south are certainly probably wondering what all theexcitement is about.''</TEXT></DOC>
