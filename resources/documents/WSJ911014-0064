The results nevertheless were slightly ahead ofexpectations on Wall Street. Like others in the industry,Alcoa and Alcan, the world's two largest aluminum makers,have been hurt by depressed prices for their product.Aluminum producers continue to operate at close to capacitydespite weaker-than-expected demand and hefty aluminumshipments from the Soviet Union.</LP><TEXT>   Pittsburgh-based Alcoa reported net income of $75.9million, or 88 cents a share. In the 1990 period, Alcoaearned $125.1 million, or $1.46 a share. Excluding a negativeforeign currency adjustment of $7.4 million, or nine cents ashare, the most recent results bettered analysts' estimatesof 89 cents a share. Revenue fell to $2.47 billion from $2.68billion. Alcoa said weak prices for its construction-relatedproducts earlier in the year spread to other fabricatedaluminum products.   The depressed prices for aluminum ingot and low-endfabricated aluminum products had an even more profound effecton Montreal-based Alcan, which has more exposure to aluminumcommodities.   Alcan reported third-quarter net of $6 million, or lessthan a penny a share, down from $97 million, or 41 cents ashare. Revenue was $1.95 billion, compared with $2.24billion. The latest quarter included net one-time charges of$31 million, or 14 cents a share, related to cost-cuttingrestructuring moves. The year-earlier quarter included aone-time gain of $19 million, or eight cents a share.   The Alcan results still surprised many analysts, who hadpredicted a small third-quarter loss. Raymond Goldie, ananalyst at Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. in Toronto,credited higher prices for fabricated products compared withthe second quarter, in which Alcan did have a loss. Alcanreceived an average $3,621 a metric ton for fabricatedproducts in the third quarter, up 2.7% from $3,526 a metricton in the second quarter. A metric ton is 2,204.6 pounds.   However, Thomas Komlos, an analyst with Levesque BeaubienGeoffrion Inc. in Toronto, said Alcan directors will feelpressure to consider further cuts in the dividend, which wastrimmed to 15 cents a share from 28 cents in July. Mr. Komlossaid that after excluding equity income from affiliatedcompanies, Alcan had a loss on operations of $25 million inthe third quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
