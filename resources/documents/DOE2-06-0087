Deposits were formed bythe impingement of fly ash and products of combustion on a cooled boilersteel substrate. The deposits consisted of several layers. The most significantfindings include the following: (1) The adhesive strengths and compositionwere determined for individual particles which had formed a strong bondwith the oxide layer of the substrate. The results showed that the particlesproducing the strongest bond with the oxide can be ranked as follows:iron and silicon particles andgt; iron and sulfur particles andgt; calcium andsulfur particles. (2) The deposit growth rates for a series of Westerncoals were based on the rate of deposit formation divided by the rateof ash fired. (3) A device was developed to measure strengths of thedeposits produced in the vertical tube furnace. (4) Many of the depositsproduced from the Western coals were highly crystalline. (5) The viscosityof the glass phase was calculated based on its composition. (6) Preliminarystudies were conducted on the application of complex thermochemical equilibriumcalculations to determine the behavior of inorganic constituents duringcombustion.</TEXT></DOC>
