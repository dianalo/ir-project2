The Massachusetts firm calls the investigation a &quot;test case&quot; to define the grounds on which the U.S. software industry can fight off unfairly traded products sources like Japan and the European Community.    Although the U.S. leads in software development, Commerce Department officials worry that Tokyo's efforts to strengthen its software industry could eventually spell trouble for even such leading U.S. firms as Microsoft Corp. and Lotus Development Corp.    However, if the Commerce Department rules in the petitioner's favor, it may have to go beyond the historic interpretation of trade law to offset the alleged subsidies. Normally, the U.S. imposes a countervailing duty on subsidized imports to offset their price advantage over U.S. products. But software is different from other traded products in that it can be transmitted over telecommunications lines or through a single master disk that can be reproduced by the thousands once in the U.S.    Thus, countervailing duties wouldn't be enough to protect the U.S. products. &quot;The value of the product is in the information rather than in the media in which it's contained,&quot; said Alice Denson, the international affairs manager of Adapso, the U.S. software industry's trade body.    U.S. officials said it was the first unfair-trade investigation involving software to be opened by the Commerce Department, which plans to announce its preliminary determination by Nov. 2. If the department decides Singapore unfairly subsidized the CSA product, it has to impose countervailing duties. But if these duties aren't sufficient to offset CSA's price advantages in the U.S., the Bush administration may have to resort to other remedies, including negotiating with Singapore to persuade it to minimize or eliminate its alleged subsidies.    Generally, in unfair-trade cases, the International Trade Commission must independently determine that a U.S. industry is being injured by subsidies. However, an ITC ruling isn't required in this case because Singapore isn't a signatory to an international code limiting the use of government subsidies. Therefore, this case will be handled entirely by the Commerce Department.    In its petition, Visible Systems alleges that the Singapore subsidies are in the form of a grant of more than $10 million to CSA, the loan of government-supported technical staff, and various official assistance and incentive programs. The complaint says the subsidized product, called POSE, is being marketed in the U.S. by a CSA subsidiary, Computer Systems Advisors Inc. of Woodcliff Lake, N.J.    POSE competes in the U.S. with other products of its kind called computer-aided software engineering, or CASE. Such products are used by software designers to lay out the electronic blueprints of various types of personal-computer programs. Visible Systems estimates the U.S. market for this type of CASE software to be about $1 billion a year.    A lawyer for the Singapore government said it won't respond to the complaint until it receives a formal questionnaire from the Commerce Department.    Visible Systems acknowledges that it's exploring the outer edges of trade law in pressing its complaint. &quot;Even if the Commerce Department rules in our favor, it could be powerless to do anything about it&quot; under current trade law, said Cedric Nash, the firm's international sales manager. The larger question the U.S. has to investigate, he said, is how it will cope with &quot;numerous government-orchestrated software development efforts around the world.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
