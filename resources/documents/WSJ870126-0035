FCC and State Department approvals are necessary before Pacific Telecom Cable Inc., which is 80%-owned by Pacific Telecom, can proceed. Pacific Telecom, based in Vancouver, Wash., is a telephone holding company.    In a letter to the State Department, the FCC said the cable would enhance telecommunications competition in the Pacific. But the agency said it won't actually rule on the Pacific Telecom request until the State Department takes it up.    Pacific Telecom is aiming to attract big business users to its fiber-optic cable. The FCC so far has authorized only one other transpacific fiber-optic cable, a joint venture of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and 21 partners. That cable, which is expected to be completed in December 1988, is meant to carry a wide range of telephone traffic. </TEXT></DOC>
