Iran claimed it shot down three Iraqi warplanes while Iraq saidit downed two Iranian jet fighters.   Iran said the nuclear power station in the gulf city of Bushehrwas damaged in the Iraqi raid, but the report from the officialIslamic Republic News Agency did not provide details. Theunfinished plant was bombed last November, and 11 people werekilled. Iran at the time claimed fissionable material was stored atthe site, but the report was never confirmed independently.   The Iraqi fighters also damaged a petrochemical plant and otherindustrial targets in Bushehr, according to the IRNA reportmonitored in Cyprus.   The unfinished petrochemical plant is a joint Japanese-Iranianproject. IRNA said Japan announced today it was willing to begintalks on completing the project.   The Iranian agency said the Iraqis also launched air raids nearthe city of Ahvaz in the southwestern province of Khuzestan. ``Theywere intercepted by heavy fire of the Iranian air defensegunners,'' IRNA said.   The agency said several people were killed and wounded in theIraqi attacks.   The Iraqi military claimed it shot down two Iranian F-14 jetfighters, one in a dogfight over the gulf near the Iraqi port ofAmmiq and another over Iraqi territory in the northern oilproducing city of Kirkuk.   An unidentified military spokesman quoted by the Iraqi newsagency said the warplane downed over Kirkuk ``tried to violateinternational borders to raid residential areas ... and ouranti-air defenses shot it down.''   A Baghdad Radio report, also monitored in Cyprus, said all Iraqiplanes returned safely to base.   IRNA quoted an unidentified air force commander as denying anyIranian planes were lost. IRNA said Iran shot down three Iraqiplanes, two in dogfights over the gulf and one by anti-aircraftguns. It did not say where the third plane went down.   U.S. Navy officials in the gulf declined to comment on thereports.   On Monday, Iran announced it had agreed to a year-old UnitedNations resolution for a cease-fire in its war with Iraq, which hasclaimed an estimated 1 million lives.   The cease-fire would not take effect until details are workedout within a week to 10 days, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perezde Cuellar said Monday.   Iraq has regularly attacked Iranian shuttle tankers and key oilterminals in the gulf in an effort to choke off its enemy'srevenue-earning exports. The last two reported Iraqi raids were onJuly 14.   The sources said it was not immediately clear what type of Iraqiaircraft were involved in today's raids, but they are usuallyFrench-built F-1 Mirages armed with Exocet missiles and otheraircraft that carry missiles and bombs.   The Iraqi air activity began about 8 a.m. (1 a.m. EDT) andcontinued more than two hours later, according to an informedsource in the gulf.   An Iraqi aircraft was shot down over the central gulf, thesources said, apparently by one of Iran's U.S.-built F-14 fighters,some of which are known to be based at Bushehr.</TEXT></DOC>
