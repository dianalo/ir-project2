Not for nothing did the producers choosethe Lakota Sioux -- the tribe that is the subject of KevinCostner's award-laden film.   -- 9-9:30 p.m. EDT, on CNN.                                                                                                                           Sunday, April 14                   Absolute Strangers                                                                                                          Based on the true story of a New York woman whose family'sstruggle to terminate her pregnancy became national news,this deftly wrought abortion saga packs a punch. It will alsojar a lot of nerves. When the family of the woman -- comatosesince a car accident -- concluded that her pregancy must beterminated to ensure her survival, leaders of the local Rightto Life movement undertook extraordinary legal action toprevent it, including an effort to declare themselvesguardians of the fetus. The title echoes the amazedexpostulations of the woman's husband (Henry Winkler) as hetries to fathom what absolute strangers are doing in courtfiling briefs to prevent an operation on his wife. Neitherthese strangers, needless to say, nor the hospital, with itsdithering doctors, come off very well here, which is hardlysurprising given this theme of a family under siege. Mr.Winkler gives a finely colored performance as the harried,mournful, affectionate and, finally, tough and furioushusband.   -- 9-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS.                                                                                                                           Tuesday, April 16                 The Election Held Hostage                                                                                                          The charge that William Casey, in company with others whowanted to assure Ronald Reagan's election, contrived to delaythe release of American hostages held in Iran is the subjectof &quot;Frontline's&quot; latest investigative foray. The thesis,advanced by Gary Sick, who worked for the Carteradministration, and others is that the release of thehostages just after Mr. Reagan became president, but not asecond before, was engineered by the Reagan campaign. Theproducers of this documentary, which is brimful of sinisterinterconnecting networks and plots, do pause to note severaltimes that proof of the allegation remains elusive. Whichdoesn't seem to inhibit the flow of dark speculations here.For those with an unappeasable taste for conspiracy theories,this will be a feast.   -- 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS. PBS air dates and times vary socheck local listings.                                                                                                                           Tuesday, April 16                          Stat                                                                                                          At first it appears that the best thing to be said aboutthis new series is that it isn't about lawyers. A few minutesinto the thing, however, and it is clear that these tartlywritten sketches about a city hospital trauma center offersmore than your usual series blather about romancing interns.The script is stuffed with sharply observed detail. DennisBoutsikaris is crisply believable in the role of chiefresident physician but the real delight -- of futuresequences -- are the cameo appearances of Allan Arbus, in therole of a world weary psychiatrist, and David Opatashu as apatient. It would be nice to think they could keep thewriting at this level. Try it.   -- 9:30-10 p.m. EDT, on ABC.                                                                                                                           Wednesday, April 17             Bugs Bunny: Overtures to Disaster                                                                                                          We have the success of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; to thank for the newstatus of the animated series, one of which goes by theghastly title of &quot;Toon Night.&quot; It begins with this classicconcert in which Bugs and friends provide impressiverenderings of the great symphonic and operatic works.Soloists include Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd. The highlight isa Wagnerian duet in which Mr. Fudd, who has never been inbetter voice, shines.   -- 8-8:30 p.m. EDT, on CBS.                                                                                                                            Sunday, April 21                   The Perfect Tribute                                                                                                          So awash in bathos is this drama based on a work offiction about the Civil War and the Gettysburg Address, thatonly the presence of Jason Robards rescues it -- and thatjust barely. Mr. Robards makes an astonishing Lincoln both inappearance and presence. The Robards persona is so admirablysubmerged under the brooding brows of this Lincoln that it ison occasion startling to remember the identity of the actorat work underneath that beard. For the rest, this story of asmall boy (nicely played by Lukas Haas), his wounded brother-- a Confederate officer -- and various subsequententanglements heavily drenched in sentimentality amount to anuneven ride at best. There are two main attractions here,outside of Mr. Robards. Both of them are the GettysburgAddress, recited twice, which is some compensation for flatrhetoric and fumbling dialogue.   -- 9-11 p.m. EDT, on ABC.</TEXT></DOC>
