(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Workers at Mexican factories just acrossthe U.S. border are routinely exposed to toxins because of vague andlittle-enforced safety and environmental laws, labor leaders weretold Wednesday.   A report to the AFL-CIO Executive Council blamed both the U.S.and Mexican governments for the problems, saying Mexico has beentardy in regulating workplace safety while the United States hasignored the abuses because the area is attractive to Americancorporations looking for cheap labor and scant government regulation.   ``Both countries must undertake a massive effort to address thisalarming situation,'' said the report, which prompted a councilresolution condemning the situation and demanding action from bothgovernments.   The study looked at the nearly 800 ``maquiladoras'' employingapproximately 300,000 Mexicans in the Rio Grande. The term, Spanishfor ``golden twins,'' refers to plants operated by foreigncorporations, most of them American.   The report said that many workers are exposed to toxic chemicalssuch as PCBs and that many locals drink contaminated water fromstorage drums that once held hazardous materials.   Communities that get their drinking water from the area haveunusually high cancer rates, and much of the waste that by lawshould be returned to the United States for dumping instead isdisposed of in Mexico, the report said.   Environmental problems associated with illegal and improperdumping of toxins have spilled over into bordering communites inTexas and California, the report said, citing California's pollutedNew River as a prime example.   ``But American companies don't seem deterred,'' it said. ``Theysee increasing opportunity to capitalize on cheap labor and toescape stringent health, safety and environmental regulations inthis country by shifting operations to Mexico.''   The problems are complicated because the operations based in theregion are those that typically produce dangerous waste, such as thechemical and electronics industry, said the report by Leslie Kochan,an Oregon Department of Environmental Quality official who formerlyworked on environmental issues for the Texas Center for Policy Study.   In addition, the factories are also rife with abuses of workers,including wages of as little as $2.90 a day and working conditions``that resemble the sweatshops of the late 19th and early 20thcentury,'' the report said.   Workers often are denied information about the hazardoussubstances they handle and work without protective clothing andequipment, the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
