Two defendants denied bribery charges related to an allegedinfluence-peddling scandal involving officials and the Recruit Co.,an information and publishing conglomerate.   Kaifu told reporters the Recruit affair was ``an incident thatshould never be repeated. I think we have to work even harder onpolitical reforms.''   Takashi Kato, a former vice minister of labor, and MasaoTatsumi, a former Recruit executive, pleaded innocent as theirtrials opened in Tokyo District Court.   Kato, 59, who was in a position to supervise Recruit's lucrativepublishing business, was charged with receiving a bribe in the formof discounted shares in a Recruit subsidiary.   The prosecution alleges Kato influenced Labor Ministryregulations to benefit Recruit's booming business.   But Kato, while acknowledging the purchase of shares, said hewas not aware of a bribery intent behind the stock deal and denieddoing any favors for the company.   ``Because of a lack of discretion, I have considerably damagedthe credibility of the labor administration and caused trouble forthe government and the court, and I deeply regret it,'' Kato toldthe court.   ``But all the measures I have taken in the labor administrationwere, I believed, most suitable and I have never treated a specificcompany with a special favor,'' he said.   Tatsumi, 47, who allegedly played an intermediary role betweenKato and Recruit's founder, Hiromasa Ezoe, said he has no part inthe bargain stock deal.   ``I have never discussed the stock deal with Mr. Kato and Mr.Ezoe, and I have no knowledge about the details of the stock dealwith Mr. Kato,'' Tatsumi said.   Ezoe will be tried Dec. 15 on seven counts of bribery. Fourother trials are starting before Dec. 15 for two leadingpoliticians, six bureaucrats and four executives of the RecruitCo., which is accused of trying to win favors and influence byshowering huge donations and stock deals.   In charging Kato, Tatsumi and others involved in the stock deal,prosecutors referred to a 1988 Supreme Court decision suggestingthat trading stocks certain to rise in value and difficult for thegeneral public to obtain could amount to bribery.   Kato said in his defense he had no knowledge that the shareswere certain to rise in value or that the public would not be ableto obtain them. He also said he was not aware the stock prices wereset at artificially low levels, as alleged.   The trial is to resume Dec. 26.   Defendants in later trials include Ezoe and Takao Fujinami, aformer chief Cabinet secretary.   The Recruit scandal has shaken the foundation of Japanesepolitics since it erupted last summer. It forced Prime MinisterNoboru Takeshita from office and has been blamed for the governingLiberal Democrats' setback in July elections for the upper house ofParliament.   In a desperate attempt to leave the scandal behind, the LiberalDemocrats selected the relatively young Kaifu as premier in August.   Kaifu reiterated Friday that his party is following newguidelines curbing political donations from corporations.   The party is considering whether to call elections for the morepowerful lower house early next year.</TEXT></DOC>
