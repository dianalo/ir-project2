Earnings soared 45% to $49 million, or $1.36 a share, from$33.9 million, or 94 cents a share, a year earlier. Salesrose 3% to $453.7 million from $439.1 million.</LP><TEXT>   The latest quarter was helped by a gain of five cents ashare related to work force reduction, and a per-share gainof eight cents from a joint venture partner's $3 millionreimbursement. The 1990 period included earnings fromdiscontinued operations of two cents a share, as well as aper-share charge of eight cents for the sale of the company'sSignitron unit. Even without the items, said analyst StevenColbert of Prudential Securities, Sundstrand's earnings werea &quot;positive surprise.&quot;   A Sundstrand spokesman said the fourth quarter istypically the firm's strongest, and that it expects 1992quarterly results to be &quot;relatively flat.&quot;   In the latest quarter, Sundstrand reaped the benefits ofmore than a year of costcutting measures. About 1,000employees were dropped 1991 through reduction and attrition.Sundstrand currently has about 13,000 employees.   The company is following its strategy of shedding &quot;poorperforming&quot; operations, and acquiring higher-marginbusinesses, the spokesman said. In the 1990 fourth quarter,Sundstrand sold its lower-margin Signitron and Heat Transferbusinesses. In January 1991, it bought Milton Roy Co., a St.Petersburg, Fla., maker of instrumentation and controlequipment. Milton Roy has had a &quot;positive impact&quot; onearnings, the spokesman said.   Such restructuring moves have helped boost aerospacemargins, Sundstrand said. Margins at the company's cyclicalindustrial operations, meanwhile, continued to suffer in theweak economy.</TEXT></DOC>
