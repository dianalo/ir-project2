And in late 1985, embattled CBS management did the same thing voluntarily.    Amid a companywide cost-cutting campaign this fall, National Distillers andamp; Chemical chairman John Stookey sold the two company jets for about $15 million, saying, &quot;You can save a penny a pound or 10 cents a case just as well in the executive suite as you can on the shop floor.&quot;    Company planes can be a target for cost-cutting, or a lightning rod for criticism from shareholders who see them as a costly perk for high-living executives. And yet 328 of the 500 largest industrial corporations own their own planes. And one aircraft industry study says companies that do have greater return on equity.    Aviation Data Service of Wichita, Kan., conducts an annual census of aircraft operated by the 500 largest companies. The 1986 study showed Chevron and Allied-Signal tied for first place with 46 aircraft apiece. Tenneco, Mobil, Du Pont, Rockwell International, Occidental Petroleum, Exxon, United Technologies and General Motors rounded out the top 10 operators.    The top ranking wasn't a great stretch for Chevron, which ranked seventh in 1985 revenue with $41.7 billion. But it was for Allied-Signal, which ranked 37th in revenue with $9.1 billion. The largest companies without any aircraft included American Brands, American Home Products and Pillsbury.    Allied-Signal spokesman Mike Escolese says 38 of Allied's 46 aircraft came with companies Allied has acquired in recent years, particularly in the aerospace field, which currently accounts for more than 50% of sales. The same survey showed Boeing with nine aircraft, McDonnell Douglas with five, Rockwell International with 20 and Lockheed with eight.    &quot;We are a very large aerospace company, and we do use them for sales, demonstration and testing purposes,&quot; Mr. Escolese says. He adds that 13 aircraft are used only to test engines, aviation electronics and the like. Sometimes, he says, &quot;When executive trips are made, while the business meetings are being held, the plane is at the airport for sales and demonstration purposes.&quot;    Chevron spokesman Larry Shushan says, &quot;This is a sensitive subject because people tend to think of corporate aircraft as only executive aircraft, and that isn't the case.&quot; Mr. Shushan notes that Chevron's total, which he put at 45, includes 27 helicopters, with most serving as &quot;workhorse&quot; aircraft getting employees out to far-flung oil rigs. Chevron has among the most extensive oil exploration and production operations in the industry, he says.    The National Business Aircraft Association, a trade group for companies that operate aircraft, has directors from, among others, Goodrich, Clorox, Corning Glass Works, Cyclops, Dresser Industries, Gannett, General Electric, GM, Mead, Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing, Southern Natural Gas and Xerox.    Aerospace analyst Alan Benasuli of Drexel Burnham Lambert says deliveries of corporate jets by domestic manufacturers have declined from a peak of 389 in 1981 to about 95 in 1986. &quot;Demand is terrible,&quot; he says, because oil companies that gobbled up planes &quot;had to regurgitate them&quot; when oil prices fell. But aircraft broker Wayne Hilmer of Omni Jet Trading Floor in Rockville, Md., says computer, financial and publishing companies have been buying.    Aircraft industry representatives say companies need planes so executives can travel to plants that have been located in remote parts of the country because of the areas' low costs. Shareholders, one says, may fail to visualize &quot;the chairman of the board sitting down in Atlanta for three hours while he's missed three flights.&quot;    Earlier this month, the trade magazine Business and Commercial Aviation published a supplement, &quot;Management Mobility,&quot; that profiled top executives who use company planes. They included Hershey Foods chairman Richard Zimmerman, Coleman chairman Sheldon Coleman and American Express chairman James Robinson.    &quot;We get an occasional question from a stockholder about our ownership and use of company aircraft,&quot; Mr. Zimmerman says in the magazine. &quot;We always share the information that helps persuade them that it is a wise and prudent investment.&quot; Estimated annual cost: three cents a share.    &quot;It's not always easy to get the top executives together for a few hours at the office,&quot; Mr. Coleman says. &quot;But when we are together in the airplane there are no distractions. We have the time and, believe me, the juices flow. We have some of our most productive meetings in those airplanes.&quot;    Mr. Robinson's twin-engine Gulfstream III can seat 10 or more people, has sleeping accommodations, a conference area, an office and galley. &quot;When I fly to Europe,&quot; Mr. Robinson says, &quot;I work a full day, squeeze in a business dinner and then catch the airplane. I can knock off four or five hours of sleep on the airplane, go directly to my hotel, shower, and be ready for the next full day of work.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
