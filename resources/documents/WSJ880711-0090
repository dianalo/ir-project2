Not only the U.S. but most major countries want to manage the dollar to suit their own convenience. Japan may be an industrial giant, but it has no desire to subject the yen to that sort of nonsense.    The dollar has been climbing lately, at least temporarily reversing the drop that began in February 1985. Early last week, the dollar spurted on foreign markets for reasons entirely separate from U.S. economic management. The accidental U.S. downing of an Iranian passenger plane in the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 persons aboard, raised fears of a new international crisis. In an international crisis, investors seek a safe-haven currency, and the dollar still is perceived to be the best around.    The rise in the dollar stems in large part from the increase in U.S. exports, which has shrunk the merchandise trade deficit. The dollar's rise, moreover, lessens inflation fears, since it tends to make imports less expensive. An analysis by Lawrence H. Meyer andamp; Associates of St. Louis notes that the rise leads foreign investors to become more optimistic about the dollar's future and thus more willing to buy dollar securities, helping to push the dollar higher. &quot;A stronger dollar,&quot; the firm says, &quot;hints that the dollar may have bottomed.&quot;    Jerry L. Jordan, chief economist of First Interstate Bank of Los Angeles, is convinced that the dollar &quot;has seen its lows for this cycle.&quot; He says Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan &quot;is building up credibility as an inflation-fighter. He hasn't quite moved into the spot Paul Volcker held as the second most powerful man in the U.S., but he's making progress.&quot;    Some analysts argue that the stronger dollar will end the upsurge of U.S. exports, just as the weaker dollar started it. A few contend that the dollar not only will have to fall but will have to drop sharply to continue the improvement in the U.S. trade balance. The fact is that no one can be absolutely certain what level of the dollar is needed to sustain exports -- or just what the future level of the dollar will be. The dollar's current strength is based heavily on a foreign perception that the U.S. is beginning to get its house in order. Evidence to the contrary could send the dollar down.    All of this is happening, it should be noted, when neither the Federal Reserve nor any other major central bank has much appetite to push the dollar significantly lower or higher. The Fed prefers peace and quiet in presidential election years, so its preference presumably would be a dollar that stabilized at about the current level -- at least, between now and November. So far, Fed Chairman Greenspan has commented only that he sees no reason for the dollar to go lower. The U.S. hope obviously is that the dollar now is low enough to permit continued strength in U.S. exports.    Some central banks have sold dollars in an effort to slow the gains of the U.S. currency, but others are hesitant. If the Bank of Japan sells dollars it soaks up yen, tending to weaken the Japanese economy, now in the midst of a consumer-fueled boom. Japan knows it may eventually have to tighten credit to cool off the boom, but presumably it would prefer to base the timing on its domestic needs, not on the buoyant dollar.    The British and West Germans also have strong economies, which could be weakened by new dollar sales. Some foreigners find the current situation strange. A German banker quoted in this newspaper last week said he found it hard to believe that Germany would have to defend its mark when it has a low inflation rate, high current account surpluses and a booming export economy.    For the present, market factors seem to be working in favor of the dollar. &quot;The question is how foreign net demand for our assets will compare with our net demand for foreign goods,&quot; Mr. Jordan says. &quot;Our net demand for foreign goods is going down, while net foreign demand for our assets has picked up sharply.&quot; The U.S. is still bringing assets home from abroad, while foreigners continue to buy assets here.    One reason the outlook for sales of assets to foreigners is strong is that the inflation rates seem to be moving in our favor. The foreign perception is that U.S. inflation has stabilized, at a time when other major industrial countries are worrying about rising inflation.    Time will tell. The U.S. has found that a nation with an international currency can largely ignore inflation, trade deficits and budget deficits for a long time without disaster. But no one can ignore such fundamental factors forever.    For the near term, the Federal Reserve needs to continue to provide investors, foreign and domestic, assurance of its determination to prevent a surge of inflation, a task that is complicated by higher food prices stemming from the Midwest drought. It's unlikely that much reduction of the budget deficit will be forthcoming until after the election, if then, but it would be helpful if the presidential candidates gave more evidence that they appreciated the seriousness of the problem.    In the long run, the fundamental factors must prevail. But it's no wonder that Japan prefers to keep the yen out of the uncertainties that persist until the fundamentals assert themselves. What is surprising is that government officials don't remember that the exchange rate is a market price and thus decide to let the dollar find its own level. </TEXT></DOC>
