Cook Nuclear Plant, Unit No.1; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is consideringissuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. DPR-58 issuedto the Indiana Michigan Power Company, the licensee, for operation of theDonald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, Unit No. 1, located in Berrien County, Michigan.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment</ITAG>Identification of Proposed ActionThe proposed amendment would revise the D.C. Cook Nuclear Plant, Unit No.1 Technical Specifications to allow operation of the primary coolant systemunder reduced temperature and pressure (RTP) conditions. The proposed RTPprogram will reduce the amount of stress corrosion cracking of steam generatorU-tubes similar to that observed on the Unit 2 steam generators.The proposed amendment is in accordance with the licensee's applicationfor amendment dated October 14, 1988 as supplemented by a letter datedDecember 30, 1988, and June 5, 1989.The Need for the Proposed ActionThe proposed change by the licensee reduces the amount of stress corrosioncracking of steam generator U-tubes; therefore, reduces the propensityfor primary to secondary leaks due to cracking of steam generator U-tubes.Additionally, the proposed RTP program is expected to increase the lifeof the Unit 1 steam generators significantly.Environmental Impact of the Proposed ActionThe Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revisions tothe Technical Specifications. The staff concludes that the safety considerationassociated with operation at the proposed reduced temperatures and pressureswould not adversely affect plant safety. The proposed changes have no adverseeffect on the probability or consequences of any accident previously analyzed.No changes are being made in the types or amounts of any radiological effluentsthat may be released offsite. There is no significant increase in the allowableindividual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly,the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significantenvironmental impact.With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed amendmentinvolves systems within the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR Part 20.It does not affect non-radiological plan effluents and has no other environmentalimpact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significantnon-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 19, 1989 (54 FR 15851). No request forhearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice.Alternative to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission has concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce the environmental impacts but would result in reducedoperational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement for Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant,Units 1 and 2, dated August 1973.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consultother agencies or persons with exception to clarify certain portions ofthe licensee's proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated October 14, as supplemented by letter dated December 30,1988, and June 5, 1989, which is available for public inspection at theCommission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC, andat the Maude Preston Palenske Memorial Library, 500 Market Street, St.Joseph, Michigan 49085.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 6th day of June.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lawrence A.
