(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Mac users can often safely ignore what goes on in the tumult of the PC world.andO;Not so with Microsoft's recent introduction of Windows 3.0.andP;  This new GUI(graphical user interface) for IBM PCs and compatible computers has ended theepoch in which you had to buy a Macintosh to get a widely used GUI.andM;The advent of Win3, as users call it, will produce wide-ranging consequencesboth good nd bad - for Macintosh users.andP;  Win3 is finding widespreadacceptance among users and developers including many leading Mac-softwaredevelopers who are making their first forays out from under the Apple.andM;GUIs for PCs have been trotted out before, but before Win3, they failed toprovide the quality, speed, or acceptance that was needed to compete with theMac seriously.andP;  As an interface between the user and the operating system,Win3 still falls short of the Finder, Apple's main interface between the userand the System software.andP;  But Win3 fixes Win2's main problems: weak memorymanagement, clunky user interface, slow performance, weak networkingcapabilities, cumbersome setup, and a paucity of business applications thatfully exploit the potencial of a graphical windowing environment.andM;Unlike the Mac's Finder, which is highly integrated with the System and Machardware, Win3 is an application that runs on top of Microsoft DOS 3 or 4.andO;While the Finder and System software are included with every Mac, you usuallyhave to buy Win3 ($149) and DOS ($125 for DOS 3.3, the most common version)separately for your PC, although they are bundled with some applications andCPUs.andM;As a result, neither DOS nor Windows is a universal standard, although thevast majority of PC owners use various versions of DOS.andP;  The most popularalternatives include Microsoft OS/2, a distant cousin of DOS withmainframelike aspirations, and Microsoft Xenix, which is UNIX for PCs.andM;The Windows interface is now the same as that of Presentation Manager forMicrosoft's OS/2 environment, which makes it easier for developers to createproducts for both environments.andP;  (Microsoft originally intended Windows to bea stopgap while OS/2 was perfected, but the tail has been far outselling thedog, even in earlier versions).andM;A Big PaCkageandM;When you buy Win3, you get far more than the basic graphic environment.andP;  Aswith the original Macs and the original HyperCard release, the five-disk Win3package comes with a potpourri of tools designed for productivity and to showoff the future potential of the environment.andP;  The package includes Win3;hardware drivers for various computers, displays, printers, mice, andnetworks; rudimentary word-processing, color painting, and telecommunicationsapplication software; and some DA-like programs, such as Notepad, MacroRecorder, Cardfile, Calendar, Calculator, and Clock.andP;  You also get a run-timeversion of a HyperCard clone, Asymetrix ToolBook, as well as a ToolBook stackcalled Daybook, a personalinformation manager.andP;  You even get two games:Reversi and Solitaire.andM;Of course, the Win3 package still floats or flops on the strength of the coreenvironment - Win3 running on top of DOS.andP;  The single biggest improvementover Win2 lies in memory management.andP;  Given a minimum platform of a PC with ahard disk and an Intel 286 processor or better, Win3 lets applicationstranscend DOS's previous 640K memory limit - providing easy access to up to16 megabytes of RAM.andM;Running Win3 on a 286 is like running MultiFinder on a Mac Plus.andP;  To reallyexploit Win3, you need a 386 with several megabytes of RAM.andP;  (Most PCs arebuilt with one of three main processors - the Intel 80286, 80386, or 80486 -each offering more speed and enhanced features, just as Macs based onMotorola 68000 CPU chips are outpowered by 68020 machines, which aresurpassed by 68030s.) The payoff on a 386 is disk-based virtual memory, theability to run applications in multiple windows, and true multitasking ofstandard DOS applications.andP;  On a network, Win3 lets you log on and off fileservers and printers on the fly and manipulate print jobs that are queued up.andM;A 486-powered machine gives you the same features, only they're a lotfaster.andO;(The 486 is essentially a 386 chip with the equivalent of several supportchips and a math processor built in.) Win3 doesn't run on 8088-powered PCs,such as the old IBM XT, however, nor does it support PCs without hard-diskdrives.andM;Puffing On a Good moanandM;Win3 is more than just a pretty face.andP;  But Win3 does clothe its brains inbeauty, starting with a slick setup program that automatically configuresWin3 to your hardware, which is often a time-consuming task in the Byzantineworld of PC memory architectures.andP;  Win3 has also made other cosmeticimprovements in its user interface, such as 3-D buttons and scroll bars thatappear to actually push in when you click on them with the mouse.andM;But beneath the glitz, Windows 3 still works awkwardly in comparison with theMacintosh.andP;  Instead of the functionality of the Macintosh Finder's desktop,where both programs and data can be accessed in a unified interface, Windowssplits this capability into two entities: theandM;File Manager and the Program Manager.andM;The Program Manager contains the icons for all the programs and &quot;programgroups,&quot; which roughly resemble folders of applications.andP;  You are able toaccess data-file icons and file-manipulation functions by starting the FileManager, a separate program that provides a directory tree of files and filefolders.andM;As a result of this split in Window 3's personality, it's not possible foryou to simply double-click on a document and expect the application to launchautomatically.andP;  You can set up this automatic launch to happen with filesthat have prespecified file extensions, but it's not as easy or dependable asusing the Mac's Finder.andM;And despite the advances in Win3's interface, it still lacks many Mac GUIfeatures, such as the trash can and folders  Win3's &quot;program groups&quot; are muchless intuitive).andP;  The selection marquee is often unavailable, and filenamesare restricted to DOS's character limit (eightcharacter filename plusthree-character extension name).andM;Win3 also lacks anything as simple as the Mac's System Folder.andP;  To makesystem changes in Win3, you need to edit a variety of system files with namessuch as autoexec.bat, config.sys, system.ini, and win.ini.andP;  Worse yet, thesefiles usually reside in different directories.andP;  (A directory is a list offiles and folders at a particular hierarchical level.andP;  It's similar to thewindow that shows the files and folders when you open a hard disk  or othervolume] or subfolder in the Mac's Finder).andM;And although Mac multimedia mavens MacroMind and Farallon are teaming up withMicrosoft to provide better graphics and sound support in future versions ofWindows, the Mac System software has better support for multimedia.andP;  (Andalthough both Macs and PCs can be outfitted to provide excellent real-timegraphics output, the Mac has much better sound playback capabilities thandoes a PC.)andM;HypepCapd Does Windows?andM;HyperCard has given Mac users the ability to easily develop simpleapplications that PC users could only envy - until now.andP;  SeveralHyperCard-like programs have been announced for Win3, most notablyAsymetrix's ToolBook ($395) and Spinnaker's Plus ($495).andP;  The latter programis available in a Mac version as well.andM;Spinnaker's Win3 and OS/2 versions of Plus were not shipping at press time.andO;But one of Plus' key advantages will be the ability to run at least some ofits applications on Macintosh, Windows, and OS/2 platforms, regardless ofwhich environment the application was developed in.andP;  Plus will also have theedge on ToolBook, because of its ability to read many HyperCard stacksdirectly; these stacks can then be moved directly to the Windows or OS/2versions.andP;  XCMDs and XFCNs are not directly compatible, but Plus can accesssimilar external functions and commands through the use of Windows' DLLs(Dynamic Link Libraries).andP;  The Plus scripting language is similar toHyperTalk.andP;  Plus has some minuses, however.andP;  The primary one is that you needto buy a run-time license in order to distribute stacks, with the fee basedon how many copies you distribute.andM;Only Win3 and OS/2 versions of ToolBook have been announced.andP;  ToolBook lacksPlus' direct HyperCard compatibility, but it has more features.andP;  It addscolors, resizable windows, the ability to combine objects into a group objectwith its own name and script, and a &quot;hotword&quot; function that turns any word inany text field into a button that can contain a script.andP;  ToolBook imitatesHyperCard in both concept and function.andP;  The lack of direct HyperCardcompatibility will hamper users, but it shouldn't be a huge barrier toproficient developers.andP;  ToolBook's programming language, OpenScript,resembles HyperTalk.andP;  The languages are so similar, in fact, that a utilityfor converting Hypercard stacks to ToolBook &quot;books&quot; is being marketed byHeizer Software.andM;HyperCard runs much faster than does ToolBook (and probably faster than Pluswill, when the Win3 version is released).andP;  HyperCard's fine data compressionand search/ sort algorithms are also much better than those of its PCcounterparts.andP;  Furthermore, the well-developed Hyper-Card stack libraries andXCMDs have a big head start over the Win3 competition.andM;A Mixed PerformanceandM;We benchmarked the performance of typical tasks run on both the Windows 3 andMac platforms, and the results were mixed.andP;  We pitted three comparable pairsof applications against each other: a word processor (Word on bothplatforms), a spreadsheet program (Excel on both platforms), and a graphicspackage (Illustrator 88 on the Mac and Corel Draw on the PC, becauseIllustrator was not available for Win3 at press time).andM;At every hardware price level, our preliminary results indicate that forgraphics-related functions, the Mac is solidly ahead and thatformath-intensive tasks, it's equally solidly behind.andP;  If you ignore pricedifferences and match CPUs, the Mac operating system outperforms Win3.andM;The first test pitted a Mac SE against an equally humble 286-based PC, theIBM PS/2 Model 60.andP;  In an Excel recalculation comparison, the PC beat the Macby a large margin - nearly 2 to 1 (29.2 seconds for the Mac versus 15.1seconds for the PC) - while the Mac edged the PC in a Word test (45.0 versus47.8 seconds).andM;Now compare the Mac IIcx against a 386 PC, the IBM PS/2 Model 80, the top ofIBM's line of computers.andP;  In the graphics test, the Mac completed a redrawbenchmark 33 percent faster than the PC did (54.0 seconds versus 72.1seconds).andP;  The Mac also edged the PC in the Word test (I 3.4 versus 15.5seconds) and again was beaten by the PC in the Excel recalculation (8.8versus 4.5 seconds).andM;Finally, we brought out the big guns: the Mac IIfx against a 486 PC from aclone vendor (Club America, which uses Everex hardware in its Hawk 11 model)and a CPU with three times the number of transistors of the IIfx's 68030.andO;The results paralleled those of the shootouts between the lower-poweredplatforms.andP;  The Mac's margin in the redraw test grew even larger (21.7 versus45.0 seconds) and diminished in the Word test (4.6 versus 5.0 seconds).andO;Although both machines performed much better in the Excel recalculation test,the Mac was trounced again on a percentage basis (3.5 versus 1.9 seconds).andM;In short, there is no definitive speed leader.andP;  While Macs are faster thanWin3-equipped PCs of comparable power, PCs of comparable or lesser pricesometimes beat the Mac.andM;Envirnmental ImpactandM;What makes the Mac worth the premium? Every Mac uses basically the sameoperating system, so users aren't penalized as they upgrade hardware orchange models.andP;  The Mac has better development tools, which, arguably,translates into more interesting software, and it has a full 32-bit operatingsystem (including 32-bit color support) that affects the performance ofcertain functions.andM;And what is usually the PC's most indisputable trump card in anyPC-versus-Mac debate - domination of the installed base - is a much weakerargument in the case of Win3: Win3 will run well only on less than 25 percentof all PCs, although it will probably be popular on new systems.andP;  (In fact,many PC-clone vendors have said they will preinstall Win3 on their new 386systems.)andM;These systems can provide Mac-like functionality at a good price.andP;  Amajor-label 386SX system (with full 386 memory management but a slower businterface) with a sharp color monitor, a 40-megabyte hard disk, 2 mega-bytesof RAM, and Win3 can be purchased for less than $3,000 if you shop carefully;you'd pay far more for a comparably equipped color Mac system.andM;Many industry analysts point to the Win3 silver lining for Apple: Win3 canhelp popularize the kind of interface that the Mac has been championing foryears.andP;  This will ultimately lead to increased acceptance for the Mac atlarge corporate and government installations.andM;Apple's System 7 will further raise the benefits of the Mac side, but withthe possible drawback of splitting the installed base into two groups -System 7 haves and have-nots - much as the PC side has been segmented intodistinct classes of machines.andP;  And don't rule out the next release of OS/2,the high-performance operating system - declining chip prices have made itsmemory and processor requirements far more palatable.andM;Only one thing is certain: The interface situation will soon become even lessclear.andP;  As the distinctions between Mac and PC interfaces overlap and blur,purchase decisions will become more complex - no longer based on immediatelyvisible differences but on the myriad specific details of an overallhardware/software configuration weighed in the context of its environment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
