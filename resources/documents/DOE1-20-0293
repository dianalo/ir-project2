<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-20-0293 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors have recently advocated the study of invariant differentialsystems, which are related to Kac-Moody algebras and possible generalizations,to understand soluble nonlinear evolution equations. A result obtainedby Sparling and Chinea in spinor language shows in fact that the equationsof Ricci-flatness, when m=4, are elegantly expressed as an invariantdifferential system in {omega}/sup i/ and {omega}/sub jk//sup i/. Thiswork has been extended by Gurses and Bilge to include the cosmologicalconstant, and an Einstein-Maxwell field. The authors return to thesesystems at the end, and also mention how some prolongations found forthem appear in the present general invariant formalism.</TEXT></DOC>
