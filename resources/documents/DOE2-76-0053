<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-76-0053 </DOCNO><TEXT>Alex de Lozanne at the University of Texas has succeeded in lowering theprocessing temperatures for superconducting thin films from yttrium bariumcopper oxide (YBCO). He and his colleagues may have taken major steptoward commercializing electronic devices based on the oxide superconductors.This article describes how de Lozanne made his discovery. The availabilityof high-quality smooth films which can be manufactured at low temperatureswill open a new phase of research on the oxide superconductors. In asense, it will enable groups who want to make electronic devices to begintheir investigations, just as high-quality superconducting wire willenable people to begin making magnets from high-Tc materials.</TEXT></DOC>
