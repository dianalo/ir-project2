Discusses: establishmentof proximity between selective parameters expressing machine loads obtainedduring experimental tests and values of parameters given; establishmentof proximity between parameters obtained in two different experiments.States that the method discussed can be adopted for use in computers.Illustrates use of the method in analyzing two sets of data obtainedduring tests carried out, one in Skochinski Institute laboratories andthe other in the Rossiya mine (Krasnoarmeiskugol' association). 2refs.</TEXT></DOC>
