Students from Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan participated inthe Cedar Point amusement park's fourth annual Physics Day.   Tuesday's event allowed students to experience some of theconcepts they are studying, including gravity, acceleration, andcentrifugal force.   ``The rides show how our physics equations relate to reallife,'' said Andre Takacs, an eighth grader from Midview JuniorHigh School in Lorain County. ``If it wasn't for physics, therewouldn't be roller coasters.''   Some answers were harder to obtain than others because rain keptmany rides closed.   ``It would be a lot easier to measure the speed of the BlueStreak (roller coaster) if I was on it,'' said Angela Kabasan ofMidview.   Instead of wondering whether they could scream the loudest andraise their arms on the downhill, students were busy figuring thegravitational pull exerted on them by the new Magnum XL-200, whichthe park bills as the world's tallest, fastest roller coaster.   Physics Day has been recognized as a valid educational activityby the American Association of Physics Teachers, said RobertSpeers, an associate professor at Firelands College and originatorof the Physics Day program.</TEXT></DOC>
