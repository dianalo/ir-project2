In a move that surprised Pakistan and Miss Bhutto'sgovernment, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dissolved theNational Assembly on Monday and declared a state ofemergency, saying the government was ineffective and corrupt.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The government willfully undermined and impaired the workof the constitution,&quot; Mr. Ishaq Khan said. &quot;Corruption andnepotism in the federal government has reached suchproportions that the orderly functioning of the government nolonger carries public faith and credibility.&quot;   President Ishaq Khan appointed Miss Bhutto's mainpolitical rival, Mustafa Jatoi, as caretaker prime ministerand scheduled national elections Oct. 24. Four otherpoliticians, including a member of Miss Bhutto's PakistanPeople's Party, were named to a caretaker cabinet.   The Pakistan army took over the national televisionstation and telephone exchanges, and spread troops throughoutthe capital. But army Chief of Staff Gen. Mirza Aslam Begsaid the army wasn't taking control. &quot;We are not going to getinvolved,&quot; he said.   The state of emergency, declared early Monday morning,suspends certain individual rights. Miss Bhutto on Mondaywarned her supporters not to resort to violence.   At a news conference, Miss Bhutto called the assembly'sdissolution &quot;illegal and unconstitutional&quot; and labeled thecharges against her government a &quot;slander campaign.&quot; She alsosaid the army had surrounded her Islamabad residence.   But her press secretary, Kamran Shafi, said Miss Bhuttowanted the elections to be held in October, adding, &quot;She'sabsolutely certain the PPP will come in with a biggermajority.&quot;   The big question is whether Mr. Ishaq Khan actually willhold elections. If he does, Miss Bhutto's political rivalswill have a huge advantage in competing against a primeminister dismissed for ineffectiveness and corruption. If thepoll isn't held, Miss Bhutto may prove to be the victim of amilitary coup camouflaged by promises of elections.   Mr. Ishaq Khan, who became president after the death ofGen. Mohammad Zia ulHaq in 1987, maintains close ties withthe military. In 1977, when Gen. Zia overthrew then PrimeMinister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Miss Bhutto's father, hepromised elections that weren't held for eight years, andfinally occurred only under an altered constitution. In 1979,Gen. Zia ordered Mr. Bhutto's hanging after the former primeminister had been convicted of ordering the murder of apolitical foe.   In dissolving the assembly Monday, Mr. Ishaq Khan probablywas acting within his power under the 1973 constitution thatGen. Zia amended in 1985 to strengthen the power of thepresident. The constitution says the president &quot;may alsodissolve the National Assembly at his discretion where, inhis opinion, an appeal to the electorate is necessary.&quot; MissBhutto probably will challenge the order in court.   Mr. Ishaq Khan's charges against Miss Bhutto and hergovernment will ring true to many Pakistanis. She inheritedserious problems when she became prime minister in 1989,including widespread poverty, ethnic chaos, tension withneighboring India and a restive military that has held powerfor most of Pakistan's 43-year history.   But Miss Bhutto proved an ineffective and sometimesdiffident leader, making worse some of the problems sheinherited. For nearly a year, Miss Bhutto's governmentconcentrated on political survival in the National Assembly,where she ruled in a coalition. Even after she survived ano-confidence vote last November and won over enoughassemblymen to command a thin majority -- 137 of 237 seats --she wasn't able to control the country.   In particular, her government was powerless to stopwidespread rioting in June in two cities in Sindh, her homeprovince. Miss Bhutto finally had to ask the army to move into restore order.   Allegations of corruption were leveled against MissBhutto's ministers, party associates and even her husband,businessman Asif Zardari. Miss Bhutto and her husband deniedthe charges.   Her poor record will give some legitimacy to PresidentIshaq Khan's decision to sack Miss Bhutto and dissolve theNational Assembly. At the same time, analysts said, histiming should be ideal for Miss Bhutto's electoralchallengers, coming so soon after her failure in Sindhprovince. Miss Bhutto wasn't required to call elections until1994.   Many of Miss Bhutto's party members in the assembly haveexpressed fears about an early election, saying they have noachievements to show voters. In 20 months in power, thegovernment has passed no legislation except the federalbudget.   Miss Bhutto's relationship with the army also hasdeteriorated. Earlier in the year, she and the army werecooperating on policy toward Kashmir, the violence-wrackedprovince claimed by both Pakistan and India. The twocountries came close to war, but the crisis brought togetherthe ruling triad of Pakistan: Miss Bhutto, the army andPresident Ishaq Khan.   The crisis in Sindh fractured that alliance. The armyfaulted Miss Bhutto for not solving it by political means andnoted that supporters of her own party were involved inviolent clashes there that have claimed more than 400 livessince late May.</TEXT></DOC>
