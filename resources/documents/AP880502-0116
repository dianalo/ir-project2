Alice McGillion, a police spokeswoman, said 14 of the hostagesslipped away when he let them go to the bathroom, make photocopiesor run other errands.   ``When the last man was there, he (the gunman) turned to him andsaid, `OK, you can go too,''' McGillion said.   The hostages were apparently unharmed, authorities said. Trafficin the surrounding streets of lower Manhattan was tied up by theincident, which drew the police bomb squad and other specializedpolice units.   Members of the police hostage negotiating team moved intooffices on the floor where the hostages were taken.   The man, identified as Bill Saunders and believed to be a formerATandamp;T employee, then surrendered at around noon, police said. Hisformer wife, who works in the office where he took the hostages,was in Trenton, N.J., this morning seeking a permanent restrainingorder against him.   McGillion said Saunders never threatened the hostages or madeany demands. She said he told the employees in the ATandamp;T officesthat ``he did not want to hurt them, that they were really not apart of this.''   ``He's emotional. He's in the midst of a domestic situation,''McGillion said of Saunders.   Saunders went to the 25th floor of the building around 9:30a.m., looking for his former wife, Geraldine. McGillion said thecouple were divorced three years ago and were fighting over custodyof the children.   Police rushed his former wife to the scene when Saunderssurrendered without incident about 11:20 a.m. Police did notimmediately determine whether the grenade device was real.   The charges against Saunders, whose age and home address werenot immediately known, had not been determined, said policespokeswoman Diane Kubler.   ``On Saturday he threatened her life and she went and got atemporary order which was served on him yesterday,'' she said. ``Heshowed up at her office this morning but she wasn't there. She wasdown in Trenton ... getting a permanent restraining order.''   EMS Capt. Steven Khur said EMS technicians evaluated the freedhostages on the 24th floor of the building. ``It appears none ofthe hostages have received any injuries, just trauma.'' Khur said.</TEXT></DOC>
