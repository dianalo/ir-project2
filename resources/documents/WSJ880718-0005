The 59-year-old Mr. Seow, who was permitted to go to Malaysia, said he is mulling his future, but added that he has promised to delay any announcement of his plans until he returns to Singapore.    Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs said Mr. Seow was released on the condition that he doesn't associate or communicate with any foreign diplomat.    A former solicitor general, Mr. Seow is a prominent critic of the Singapore government who had been widely expected to run as an opposition candidate for Parliament in the next general election. Under the constitution an election must be held in Singapore before the end of next year.    Mr. Seow was arrested in connection with an alleged U.S. subversion plot against Singapore, according to the government. At Singapore's request, the U.S. removed diplomat E. Mason Hendrickson from Singapore. He was accused of meddling in Singapore politics. Throughout the Seow affair, the U.S. has denied any wrongdoing or interference in Singapore politics. </TEXT></DOC>
