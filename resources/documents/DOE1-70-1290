The vibrational excitation, in the H/sub 2/ molecularbeam, is produced by low energy electron bombardment. The reaction isobserved through the spontaneous fluorescence of the product OH(A/sup2/{Sigma}/sup +/). The measured spectrum corresponding to the (0-0) A/sup 2/{Sigma}/sup +/ -andgt; X/sup 2/ {pi} transitions is consistent witha simulated statistical rotational distribution of OH(A/sup 2/{Sigma}/sup+/), i.e. the ''prior'' distribution of the information-theoretic approach.A strongly non-statistical effect on the spin distribution is observed:the OH(A/sup 2/{Sigma}/sup +/) appears to be produced with only 1/3 ofmolecules in the -1/2 spin state.</TEXT></DOC>
