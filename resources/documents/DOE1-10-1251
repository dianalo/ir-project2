Twomethods are comparatively evaluated: analysis of selected strong miningtremors, and analysis of mining tremor sequences (all tremors occurringin a mine section irrespective of tremor magnitude and energy). Analysisof mining tremor sequences is recommended. Mathematical models are analyzedwhich describe microseismic events in coal bearing strata and which shouldbe used for determining probability of mining tremors with an energyexceeding a certain level or for determining rock burst probability.Use of the models is discussed with examples. 6 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
