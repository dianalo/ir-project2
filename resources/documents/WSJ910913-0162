About a dozen self-proclaimed political activistshave tried to assemble peacefully to demand amnesty for allpolitical prisoners in Cuba. But word is they have met withviolence.   A fellow Cuban-American journalist and I hurriedly take acab to the scene. The terrified taxi driver triesunsuccessfully to dissuade us from going. He drops us offabout a block from the demonstration and agrees to wait.</LP><TEXT>   As we begin making the rest of our way on foot, videocameras in hand, we suddenly find ourselves surrounded by amob of about 40 to 50 people, dressed in civilian clothes.They have been deployed to smash the demonstration instorm-trooper fashion. For 15 to 20 terrifying minutes, theirdeafening, hate-filled chants drown out all my attempts tosustain a rational discourse. There is no reasoning possiblewith such people. A few of them kick us and hit us over thehead. Several of them have walkie-talkies visibly stickingout of their pants pockets, evidence of their officialstatus.   Finally, the thugs force the horrified cab driver to veerhis car around. We are shoved into the back seat, as the mobpounds hysterically on the sides and trunk of the tiny,Soviet-made Lada and shouts, &quot;Worms go home]&quot; and &quot;Up withcommunism]&quot;   As we drive off, an overwhelming sadness envelops me. Ifind myself crying, less out of nervousness than from thedramatic realization that my country -- a beautiful island ofwarm, sensual, hospitable people -- may well be on the vergeof a major civil disaster.   Organized mobs, such as the one that broke up the VillaMarista rally last Friday, are just the latest attempt byFidel Castro to cap seething social tensions wrought bycommunism's collapse in the Soviet Union and the Kremlin'sdecision to end subsidization of Cuba's moribund economy. Themobs are called &quot;rapid-action brigades.&quot; Their assignment: toquell the slightest signs of public unrest among a peoplethat have been squeezed to the limit -- politically andeconomically -- by their aged and irrational leader.   My 10-day trip to Cuba -- the first in the 31 years sincemy family fled communism -- brings up the same question overand over: In the midst of such violent repression, will theCuban people be able to shake off the tyrannical system thatbinds them as the people of the Soviet republics and EasternEurope have done?   Objective conditions are ripe for social upheaval --something that even top party officials concede in privateconversations. Cuba, by any rational standard, is an economicbasket case. General scarcity and deprivation are the orderof the day. So is national discrimination; while tourists andhigh government functionaries freely enjoy the benefits andluxuries of most capitalist economies, the people mustcontinue to do without. One midlevel party member told methat he spends six to eight hours a day just finding enoughfood to put on his family's dinner table. &quot;We are treatedlike foreigners in our own land,&quot; was one complaint repeatedtime and again.   Hence, it is little wonder that, with few exceptions, thepeople no longer believe in their political leadership. Inprivate, many call Fidel Castro &quot;Un Loco&quot; -- a madman, whocontinues demanding eternal sacrifice, while he and hiscohorts reside in magnificent splendor. Cubans' frustrationand resentment are evident in the endless bread lines andpacked buses, where the slightest altercation can turninstantly into a fistfight.   On the other hand, 32 years of repression combined withemotional dependence on Papa Fidel thus far continue to keepsuch frustration from boiling over. There is no MikhailGorbachev in Cuba willing to open the floodgates of&quot;glasnost&quot; and &quot;perestroika.&quot; Nor is there, as of yet, avisible Lech Walesa, with the charisma necessary to lead arevolt from below. The valor of those in the smallhuman-rights movement is a powerful example to the people,and the movement is growing. But it still amounts to only afew extraordinarily courageous and ideologically lucid souls.   However, while most people here still can call themselves&quot;revolutionaries&quot; in public, I did not find one -- save ourofficial hosts -- who agreed with the party line in private.Indeed, many told me that if I had a chance to chat withElizardo Sanchez and Gustavo Arcos -- Cuba's two mostprominent dissidents -- to give them their best. &quot;Tell them,&quot;said one man, a doctor in his early 40s, &quot;that if it weren'tbecause I need to support my family, I would join them.&quot;   Mr. Arcos, mild-mannered and professorial, understands theambivalence. Still, he is sure the movement is growing by theday. &quot;How many are we?&quot; he asks rhetorically. &quot;Hundreds,perhaps thousands. Repression has taught us to organize intoclandestine cells throughout the country, as was done during{Castro's predecessor} Batista's dictatorship. That's why Icannot give you a specific figure.&quot;   In that kind of environment it is extremely difficult topredict how or when the end of Castroism will come about.Some are still pinning their hopes of fundamental change onnext month's party congress. But even those hopes do notnecessarily translate into faith. As one reformmindedofficial -- a highly intelligent if tragic figure who isclose to Castro -- candidly confessed to me: &quot;I have nochoice but to believe it. If not, I will die.&quot;   Other reformers both within and without the partyrationalize their inaction by citing the virulentanti-communist rhetoric of some Miami-based radio stations,which are easily heard on the island. &quot;I am deeply afraid ofwhat the future holds for Cuba,&quot; says a 50-year-oldschoolteacher and party member. &quot;Will I be shot for being aCommunist? Will the American flag end up flying over theMorro castle?&quot; The Cuban government, of course, does not failto exploit such fears and blow them out of proportion.   How long Castro can continue successfully to employdemagogy and persuasion to sustain himself in power, not eventhe aging dictator can know for sure. If he did, he would notcreate fascist-style rapid-action brigades, such as the oneused against peaceful protesters on Friday. Nor would he bemaking tardy -- and, at this point, insufficient -- overturesto moderate segments of the exile community. That was hisgoal in authorizing last week's precedent-setting encounterbetween the Cuban journalists from Havana and Miami.   I attended that encounter in the hopes of helping tocreate a more favorable climate for peaceful change in Cuba.I came away convinced that the need for such change isgreater than ever, but that with Castro in power it willnever come about.   ---   Mr. Lopez-Miro is a free-lance writer and former editorialwriter and columnist for the Miami Herald.</TEXT></DOC>
