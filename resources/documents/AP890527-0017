Under a city plan, the ads will be banned from The Hague's 250advertising billboards after renewal of their annual leasecontracts, he said. Bellm said the tobacco ads, on about two-thirdsof the public advertising space, bring in $90,000 a year.   He noted that in 1986, about 800 people in the city of 450,000succumbed to tobacco-related diseases such as lung cancer, heartattacks and respiratory problems. That was the latest year forwhich figures are available.   The Dutch government is considering extending a nationwide banon tobacco promotion on radio and television to a morecomprehensive one.</TEXT></DOC>
