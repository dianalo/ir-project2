Excellent linear correlation of track density withneutron dosage was observed after chemical and/or electrochemical etching.Excellent tracks were also obtained for radon exposure. Copolymers ofCR-39 with methyl acrylamido glycolate methyl ether, MAGME, have beenexplored as a means of improving track etching and better simulatinghuman tissue.</TEXT></DOC>
