The average rose 127.30 points Friday, to 20,048.35. Profit-taking during Saturday's half day of trading caused the average to fall 24.80 points, to end the week at 20,023.55.    The stock exchange index increased 18.92 points, to 1750.65, Friday, and a further 7.69 points Saturday, to 1758.34.    Volume totaled 550 million shares during Saturday's half-day session. On Friday, 1.2 billion shares changed hands, down from 1.3 billion shares Thursday.    The Nikkei average crossed the 20,000-point level during a volatile session Friday. It began rising in the morning as investors bought power-utility stocks on the recommendation of securities houses. However, profit-taking in financial shares caused the average to fall into the minus column by the close of the morning session.    In the afternoon, renewed strength in the financial sector pushed the average toward the 20,000-point mark. As that level neared, television crews arrived on the Tokyo exchange's trading floor, which one trader said encouraged brokers to push up the average. After the average broke through the mark, the crews departed -- and the indicator fell below 20,000 points as profit-taking returned. Finally, renewed buying of financial shares pushed the average back above 20,000 points.    Despite the rise, few fresh fundamentals were reported in the market, although traders said investor sentiment is being bolstered by last week's U.S. intervention in support of the dollar and by continued speculation that the Japanese discount rate will be cut.    In London Friday, the Financial Times industrial share index rose 14.0 points, to 1441.0, and the Financial Times 100-share index gained 10.2 points, to 1808.3. Trading was quiet.    Brokers said the session was featureless, although U.S. buying pushed up some shares. They said overall market sentiment was bullish.    Stocks were depressed in early trading by a rumor that Midland Bank planned a rights offering. But an offering wasn't announced, which a broker said helped the market Friday. Rights offerings, under which a company's holders are offered the right to buy stock in proportion to shares already held, tend to depress the market because investors fear they will drain liquidity.    The Financial Times gold mines index eased 0.8 point Friday, to 321.8.
