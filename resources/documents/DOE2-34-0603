The probabilityfor /sup 50/Ti(/sup 90/Zr,/sup 51/V)/sup 89/Y, 1p-transfer reaction,on the other hand, agrees with the same theory. The internuclear distancewhere the 1n-transfer probability first deviates from tunneling predictionscoincides with the threshold of the fusion barrier distribution deducedfrom the experimental fusion cross sections of the /sup 50/Ti+/sup 90/Zrsystem, suggesting a common mechanism for the large enhancement of 1n-transferand fusion cross sections.</TEXT></DOC>
