Journal on gun control:   Our gun-crazed society has claimed five more victims. Five moreinnocent lives. Five more children. ...   The violent, gut-wrenching, purposeless plot seems always thesame: A maniac with a gun goes berserk and opens fire onunsuspecting and innocent victims.   Sometimes it's in a restaurant; sometimes its on the freeway. On(Jan. 17), it happened to take place at a California elementaryschool during recess. ...   We all share the blame, some of us more than others _ but none ofus more than the National Rifle Association. The NRA hasconsistently and effectively thwarted or resisted every attempt toenact even the barest restraints on gun ownership.   And the NRA, skilled in guerrilla intimidation, has done so bytransforming state and federal politicians into spineless jellyfishwhile most of the rest of us just stand by counting victims inmassacre stories. ...   We urge each and every one of you to call and-or write ourlawmakers and demand that they put an end to this senseless violence.   Insist, at the very least, on a seven-day waiting period beforeguns are sold. Demand tough screening procedures. Require a ban ofsuch killing machines as the AK-47 and other weapons that serve nopurpose other than to slaughter people.   Like it or not, the blood of those five innocent children is onour hands, too.</TEXT><TEXT>   Jan. 21   Kennebec Journal, Augusta, Maine, on George Bush's presidency:   The phrase ``kinder, gentler,'' endlessly repeated as it hasalready been, is now functioning as a key expectation of the Bushadministration. ...   Part of (President) Bush's program could cause him trouble. Hewants a kinder nation without more spending on domestic programs,and, of course, ``no new taxes.''   Rather, like (Ronald) Reagan, though a bit more plausibly, helauds the ``thousand points of light,'' the volunteer groupsfighting poverty, homelessness and hunger.   The trouble is, charity has never fulfilled the role Reagan, andnow Bush, have assigned it. ``Relief,'' as it was called during theGreat Depression, gave people a free meal but did not cure the lackof schooling and jobs which produced often hopeless conditions ofpoverty.   Only a full scale commitment by government to, yes, the welfarestate, can ever truly be expected to cure poverty. ...   Social Security is the most successful anti-poverty program everdevised. Before it began, nearly 7 in 10 older Americans lived inpoverty. Now fewer than 1 in 10 do. But such solutions aren't cheap:Social Security pays out $200 billion in retirement benefits everyyear. ...   Don't expect any such radical move in Bush's first year. But ifhe takes his own advice seriously, eventually he will have to changehis mind, and his policies.</TEXT><TEXT>   Jan. 19   Asbury Park (N.J.) Press on President Bush's views on racerelations:   It is hardly a secret that (former President) Reagan has neverbeen sensitive to the plight of poor blacks and other minorities inthis country. Nor has he taken pains to conceal this disinterest.   That's why it was so refreshing to hear (President) Bush speakout ... on what (the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s) message means tohim.   (Bush called) the slain civil rights leader ``a great gift'' fromGod.   Then Bush pledged to the American people that ... he will striveto ensure ``that bigotry, and indifference to disadvantage will findno safe home on our shores, in our public life, in ourneighborhoods, or in our home, and that Reverend King's dream forhis children and ours will be fulfilled.''   That's plain talk that anybody can understand. After eight yearsof worsening race relations, it was a statement the nation needed tohear.   One thing is clear: festering racial tension ... will never beeased without strong and unambiguous leadership from the White House.</TEXT><TEXT>   Jan. 23   Los Angeles Herald Examiner on President Bush's bipartisan breeze:   Like many of his predecessors, President George Bush extended acongenial hand to Congress and the country ... during his inauguraladdress.   ``A new breeze is blowing and the old bipartisanship must be madenew again,'' he said. ...   And he has assembled a Cabinet of D.C. insiders who know theirway around. At first glance, the next four years appear ripe forcompromise and reconciliation.   But addressing America's challenges will require more thancongeniality and a sound group of advisors. It'll take guts.   Deficits, as Bush said, must come down. But they won't if he andhis budget director don't get more serious about taxes. ...   Bush wants to be known as the ``education president.'' That costsmoney.   His ``kinder, gentler nation'' that addresses the homeless, AIDS,children, ... affordable housing, etc. has a hefty price tag too.   A teetering savings and loan industry must be shored up, and thatwon't be cheap. ...   But it will be hard for us to rally around a breeze. Bush's callfor bipartisanship, however, is another matter. If he producesresults from a warmer relationship, that's someting Americans canembrace.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
