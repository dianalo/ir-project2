(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An advanced navigation satellite waspropelled into orbit Tuesday by the Air Force's new Delta 2 rocket,a 128-foot-tall booster developed after the Challenger disaster tocarry vital military payloads.   The three-stage $30 million rocket roared off its launch pad onschedule at 1:30 p.m. and the Air Force reported 30 minutes laterthat it had released the satellite into an initial elliptical orbitranging from about 100 to 11,000 miles high.   ``The spacecraft separation occurred on time and everything looksfine'' said Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the Air Force launch commentator.   On Thursday an onboard motor will fire to shift the satelliteinto a circular orbit in which both the high and low points will beabout 11,000 miles high.   The launch was postponed Sunday just 13 minutes before theplanned liftoff after balloon data showed that winds several milesabove the launch pad were too strong for the rocket to pass throughsafely.   Rand reported the winds today had shifted to a more favorabledirection and had calmed.   Aboard the Delta 2 for its maiden flight was a $65 millionNavstar Global Position System payload that will enable U.S. andallied military units such as ships, planes, submarines and tanks tolocate their positions within 50 feet by using an encrpyted channel.The accuracy for civilian users will be within 300 feet.   The satellite, which contains an atomic clock with an error rateof one second every 300,000 years, was designed to provideinformation on longitude, latitude and altitude.   The Delta 2 is a more powerful model of the Delta 1, which haslogged 170 successes in 182 launches since 1960. It is the first ofthree new space boosters the Air Force ordered built to carrynational security payloads after the Challenger exploded in 1986.   The grounding of the shuttle fleet and the Air Force Titan 34Drocket, also after a 1986 failure, has left the Pentagon with abacklog of about 40 reconnaissance, communications, navigation andother military satellites.   The new Titan 4 rocket is scheduled to debut here next month,with the Atlas 2 set for a 1990 maiden launch.</TEXT></DOC>
