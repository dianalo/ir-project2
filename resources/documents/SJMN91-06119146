Back in 1955 when Washington Hospital was but a dreamfor a cauliflower patch, 14 women got together to plan a support organizationthat became the &quot;Pink Ladies.&quot; These women were community leaders of Fremont'spre-incorporation days, the kind who'd organized blood banks during wars anddone good works in a mostly rural area. They met in the home of Josie Walton,a registered nurse whose husband, Allan, was a pharmacist and hospital boardmember. Josie Walton became the first president.;    When Washington TownshipHospital opened in 1958, the Pink Ladies staffed the lobby desk -- to meet andgreet, to comfort patients and families. Josie Walton marvels that -- amongmany activities -- today's Service League members are still the smilinggreeters. &quot;To think that they put us at the information desk and after allthese years, we're still there,&quot; she muses. &quot;You'd think someone would havechanged it, brought in paid help or made some other change.&quot; (This is a rareexample of a bureaucracy's observing the principle &quot;If it ain't broke, don'tfix it.&quot;)  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SERVICE LEAGUE STILL IN THE PINK  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Other surviving charter group members are Estelle Anderson, HarrietBuehler, Margaret Goodwin, Gloria Courson, Marilyn Whitaker, Beth Grimmer,Pauline Alameda, Louise Byrne, Claire Nixon and Laverne Robertson.;    Thismonth, the Service League hit the magic million mark for hours donated,matching the $1 million it's contributed to the hospital. The league has morethan 200 adult members and 60 junior volunteers.; (hbox);    BEAR FACTS: Itwas an abundance of Cal sweat shirts at Fremont's BrewPub-on-the-Green a weekago, when the Washington Township Cal Alumni (oldest alumni club in the state)threw a party. Craig Hill and Taylor Bell co-chaired the event, which drew 75Old Blues, including some Young Old Blues who hadn't known the local clubexisted. If it's news to you, too, Paul Luce is the person to call at (415)793-4323 for information. In honor of spring, pub owner John Rennels created astrawberry-flavor beer. While it'll never replace the strawberry daiquiri,it's surprisingly pleasant. Alumni President Barbara Elsea says the next Calevent is the annual spring brunch June 2 at the Vallejo Adobe in Niles.(That's a great little historic park, not a restaurant.); (hbox);    SWEDISHFINALE: In a flurry of blue and yellow decorations, the Tri-Cities' firstSwedish Cultural Week wound up with workshops, food and music last Saturday atthe Newark Hilton.;    Next to the smorgasbord, Swedish Consul General PeterHammarstrom, here from Los Angeles, was the star attraction. In an interview,he said that Americans often misunderstand Sweden's form of government. &quot;Weare Social Democrats -- more like the Labor Party in England. We are notCommunists any more than you are. We prefer evolution to revolution.&quot; And forthe really important stuff, he prefers lingonberries with meatloaf rather thanwith pancakes.;    He also awarded certificates to winners of the studentessay contest on Sweden. Winners were Christiana Cozzens, 10, KennedyElementary School, Newark; Ossa Fredricksson, 14, Newark Junior High School;and Joshua Williams, 16, Mission San Jose High School, Fremont.;    There aremore Swedes than you might think in the Tri-Cities. Lowell Johnson is &quot;85percent Swedish,&quot; says his wife, Newark Councilwoman Susan Johnson, and NewarkSchool Board President Mel Norberg is mostly Swedish. Others at the party withvarying percentages of Scandinavian genes included Newark Councilwoman ShirleySisk (some Danish), real estate man Don (&quot;Kiss me, I'm Norwegian&quot;) Arnt,florist Dirk Lorenz (grandmother is Norwegian). A couple of people tried tosneak in under the herring barrier, Fremont Mayor Bill (&quot;Bjorn&quot;) Ball andCouncilman John &quot;Dutraborg,&quot; who insisted, &quot;It's a well-known fact that theSwedes visited the Azores.&quot; Former Newark City Manager-turned-artist DickTurnlund (Swedish) sent several paintings of that outpost of LittleScandinavia, New Orleans.;    Swedish Culture Week -- all presided over byGigi Stengard -- went out with a noisy, good-time finale, the fourth annualTri-City Treats Food Fair, also at the Hilton. It was a 20-restaurant ethnicextravaganza and reminder that all restaurants around here are not chains.Sergio's manager Luis Montero was deftly flaming the brandy for &quot;BananasPatricio.&quot; (Don't try this at home, kids.) Yolanda Cardenas of Casa La Palmarestaurant in Newark was resplendent in a red Mexican dress. The family-stylerestaurant is going full speed ahead since recovering from a disastrous firelast August.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Robin Worthington column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910428  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  732  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday April 28, 199100119146,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
