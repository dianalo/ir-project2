Congress adopted a federal sentencing system in 1984 thatwas designed to eliminate some of the wide disparities thatexisted when judges had broad sentencing discretion. The lawcreated a commission that proposed sentencing guidelines. Theguidelines include a narrow sentencing range for eachoffense, fluctuating with the severity of the crime and theindividual's criminal record.</LP><TEXT>   The law authorizes judges to depart from the guidelineswhen they encounter factors that weren't considered by thecommission. In most cases, judges determine the sentence byrelying on a probation officer's report, which may recommenda tougher penalty than the guidelines. Defendants may reviewthose reports in advance.   Yesterday's decision involved the more unusual case inwhich a judge decided, without prompting by the probationreport, to impose a higher sentence than the guidelinessuggest.   By a 5-4 vote, the high court said Congress didn't allowjudges to impose stiffer penalties without notifying theparties in a case.   The decision was written by Justice Thurgood Marshall. Thecase marked the first dissenting opinion by the court'snewest member, Justice David Souter, who was joined by ChiefJustice William Rehnquist and Justices Byron White and SandraO'Connor.   The ruling requires U.S. Judge Norma Johnson ofWashington, D.C., to reconsider a 60-month prison term sheimposed on William Burns, a former Agency for InternationalDevelopment supervisor who pleaded guilty to theft of federalfunds. (Burns vs. U.S.)                                                                                                          Police Interrogation                                                                                                          The high court ruled, 6-3, that when a suspect is beingrepresented by a lawyer in one criminal case, police maystill question him about another crime without a lawyerpresent unless he specifically objects.   The justices said that an accused person who isrepresented at arraignment or a bail hearing by a lawyerinvokes only the Sixth Amendment right to a lawyer incriminal trials. But the right to have a lawyer presentduring police interrogation, the court said, comes from thelandmark decision of Miranda vs. Arizona, which was based noton the Sixth Amendment, but on the Fifth Amendment protectionagainst compelled self-incrimination.   In an opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the highcourt said that invoking the Sixth Amendment right doesn'tautomatically also trigger the Miranda right. A suspect can'tclaim that his statements to police about one crime must beexcluded from evidence as a violation of his Miranda rightsbecause he was already represented by a lawyer in court inanother criminal case.   Justice John Stevens dissented, joined by JusticesMarshall and Harry Blackmun. Yesterday was the 25thanniversary of the Miranda decision. (McNeil vs. Wisconsin)</TEXT></DOC>
