(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Death-penalty foes sang and prayedTuesday for convicted killer Jeffrey Joseph Daugherty and hisvictims, one day after the prisoner was executed in Florida'selectric chair.   Meanwhile, the Florida Supreme Court issued stays of executionTuesday after hearing appeals by two other death-row inmatesscheduled to die Thursday morning.   The court granted an indefinite stay for John Marek, who wassentenced to die for the June 1983 rape and strangulation of AdellaM. Simmons in Broward County.   The justices also granted a temporary stay, effective throughnoon Monday, to Leo Alexander Jones, who was sentenced to die forthe sniper shooting of Jacksonville police Officer Thomas J.Szafranski in May 1981. Jones' death warrant is effective throughnext Wednesday, and he could be executed if the Supreme Court or afederal court doesn't extend the stay.   The warrants issued for the two men's executions were originallygood for the period Nov. 9 through Nov. 16, but none of the 19inmates executed since 1979 has died under their initial warrants.Six other inmates on Florida's death row are scheduled to beelectrocuted in the next two months.   About 35 clergy and other anti-capital-punishment activistsgathered in the Capitol rotunda for the protest Tuesday. Theyemphasized also that they were praying for Daugherty's four victims,as well as Daugherty and the other men Florida has executed in thelast decade.   ``Our intention is not to diminish the gravity of his crimes.Jeffrey took the lives of four innocent human beings during aninexcusable crime spree, and was deserving punishment,'' saidElizabeth Dawson of the Florida Clearinghouse on Criminal Justice.``Yet Jeffrey did not deserve to die, even at the hands of thestate.''   Several protesters said Daugherty's execution, originallyscheduled for late last week, was timed deliberately to take placeclose to Election Day, and that Gov. Bob Martinez was playingpolitics with human life.   Roberta Christie, a member of the Tallahassee chapter of AmnestyInternational, a worldwide human rights group, said the timing ofthe execution demonstrates ``that political leaders cynically usethe death penalty to further their careers.''   An aide to Martinez said legal considerations, not politicalfactors, played the only part in Martinez's decision to signDaugherty's second death warrant last month.   ``If you wanted to be cold about it and analyze it that way, itwas a terrible day politically because it got buried in the news,''said Brian Ballard, director of operations for Martinez.   Daugherty, 33, was electrocuted shortly after 5 p.m. Monday forthe March 1, 1976, murder of Lavonne Patricia Sailer, a 48-year-oldhitchhiker from Minnesota whom Daugherty picked up in Brevard County.   She was one of four people Daugherty killed during a three-weekcrime spree.   He also was under life sentences for the slayings of BettyCampbell, 50, in Volusia County; Carmen Abrams, 60, in FlaglerCounty; and Elizabeth Shanks in Hollidaysburg, Pa.   Daugherty was the 103 person to be executed in the United Statessince the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.</TEXT></DOC>
