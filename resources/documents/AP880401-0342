The move will ``enable both companies to explore alternativeoptions to achieving their respective objectives,'' said Thomas J.Ward, Dravo's acting chief executive officer.   The business ultimately could go to Westinghouse, Ward said, butthe sale ``is now more likely to involve one of the potentialbuyers who expressed interest prior to the reaching of thepreliminary agreement with Westinghouse.''   Dravo officials also said the company has executed a letter ofintent to sell its interests in geothermal energy production inCalifornia to a joint venture organization formed by BonnevillePacific Corp. of San Jose, Calif., and Calpine Corp. of Salt LakeCity.
