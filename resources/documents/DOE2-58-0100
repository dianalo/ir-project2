There is no temperaturedependence either. The report discusses the functioning mode which isbased on evaluation of a gap in the resistance of the cell which is inducedwhen two sheets move apart from each other in the process of pumpinghydraulic oil, at the point when external pressure is reached. Theoreticalstudies were supplemented by laboratory tests both in an autoclave andin a tube filled with salt rock grus, under a uniaxial press. The errorobserved with measurements in an oil-pressure autoclave was within theorder of magnitude of the reading accuracy of the measuring equipment,i.e. it was less than 0.3% at 150 bar. This is to be taken as the errorto be attributed to the cell.</TEXT></DOC>
