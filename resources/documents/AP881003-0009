Gen. Juan Velasco, a stocky career soldier and fiery speaker,toppled Peru's democratic government on Oct. 3, 1968, and forcedthen-president Fernando Belaunde into a lengthy exile.   Under an ambitious program labeled ``neither capitalist norcommunist,'' Velasco's regime radicalized Peruvian politics,imposed widespread state economic controls and began lasting socialreform.   In a military legacy, Velasco steered Peru away from the UnitedStates and toward the Soviet Union. Peru remains Latin America'sleading purchaser of Soviet arms outside of Central America,according to the U.S. government.   Leftist political parties, which had operated on the fringe ofnational politics, emerged during the Velasco era to become adominant force.   His efforts to revolutionize Peru's deeply entrenched classstructure, while cutting dependence on the United States, wonwidespread acclaim throughout the Third World.   ``Velasco was a person who wanted to make reform in behalf ofthe poor. He had a genuine commitment to that,'' said Felipe Ortizde Zevallos, head of the respected economics analysis firm Apoyo.   But Ortiz de Zevallos and other Peruvian analysts say Velasco'swell intentioned efforts to set Peru on a more socially just coursefailed due to nearsightedness and contradictory and authoritarianpolicies.   The military strongman himself was deposed in another bloodlessmilitary coup amid increasing economic woes in 1975. He died twoyears later after a lengthy illness.   The succeeding military government of Gen. Francisco MoralesBermudez toned down the strident nationalist rhetoric thatfrightened the middle and upper classes and alienated foreignbusinessmen and investors.   It also began dismantling some of Velasco's reforms whilepreparing the way for restoration of democracy. Belaunde wasre-elected president in 1980.   Analysts say the current policies of President Alan Garcia,elected to a five-year-term in 1985, reflect the authoritarianapproach at reforming Peru's conservative structure.   Garcia's nationalization of Peru's private banks a year ago, inthe mold of Velasco, met great opposition and aggravated Peru'smounting economic woes, analysts said.   Analysts said a major reason for the 1968 coup was the beliefthat stability provided by a military government was needed tofoment modernization and avoid growth of insurgency movements.   ``The military was absolutely convinced that the country had tobe changed in a scheme of social justice,'' said Federico Velarde,director of the social studies institute Desco.   Despite Velasco's efforts, one of the world's most mysteriousand bloody leftist guerrilla groups, the Shining Path, took up armsin 1980 in a growing insurgency that has claimed 12,000 lives.   Velasco's first moves were a series of widespreadnationalizations, which started with the takeover of the Exxonsubsidiary International Petroleum Company.   As the state's economic role grew, the government imposedproduction and distribution reform and allowed worker participationin businesses.   Peru's communist-dominated unions have since become one of thenation's most powerful political and economic forces in Peru.   Velasco then wrenched from Peru's aristocracy the rich sugar andcotton plantations of the coast and the massive cattle and farminghaciendas in the highlands, aiming an agrarian reform at returningland to the Indian peasants who worked it for centuries as virtualserfs.   Ortiz de Zevallos said many of the Velasco's programs resultedin a morass of inefficiency because they were poorly planned andexecuted.   The quantity and quality of industrial and agricultural outputdeclined between 1968 and 1975, he said.   Ortiz de Zevallos said Peru under Velasco began a process ofindebtedness to foreign lenders, which led to a false sense ofwell-being that still exists.   ``The situation produced exactly the opposite of what themilitary government had proposed,'' said Julio Colter, director ofthe Institute of Peruvian Studies, a sociological researchorganization.   ``A new round of social inequalities followed that manifestedthemselves in intensified class struggle and a generalizedopposition to the government,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
