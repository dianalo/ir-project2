(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Joseph DevlinandM;and Emily BerkandM;Looking for the perfect corporate word processor -- one with specialized oradvanced features to fit your every need?andP;  These days, it may be harder thanit seems, with new versions and longer feature lists always in the works.andM;Mark Ostroff, a word-processing consultant and president of OstroffEnterprises, a word-processing consulting firm in Washington, D.C., had someadvice about what not to look for: &quot;Never pick a word processor just becauseit has the longest list of features.andP;  Feature lists can be very deceiving.&quot;andO;Instead, he said, &quot;Look at how features are invoked.&quot;andM;Modern word processors are so complex and loaded with features that a closeexamination of every feature may not be possible.andM;Establish Your PrioritiesandM;A better buying strategy may involve drafting a list of important functionsthe word processor must perform, and then focusing on the features that canbest get those jobs done.andM;For example, a bank should look for a package that does a good job offormatting and editing numerical information, while a law office will need apackage that aids in the drafting of legal papers.andP;  If the production of longmanuscripts and scholarly articles is the primary concern, the package shouldprovide superior footnoting and indexing features.andM;Once a package has been chosen, it's important to give it a trial run.andM;&quot;Everyone claims to do everything, but implementations vary significantly,&quot;said Bill Dawson, product manager for OfficeWriter with Software PublishingCorp. in Mountain View, Calif.andP;  &quot;Make sure to try the package.andP;  Make sure thefeatures listed in the spec sheets are the ones you really need.&quot;andM;Software for the legal profession, now one of the best-defined niches in wordprocessing, is an area in which specialized features have blossomed.andP;  Onerelatively new feature that has attracted attention from this group isredlining.andM;&quot;Redlining is of particular interest to lawyers and defense contractors whohave to track changes in documents all the time,&quot; said John Reingold, aproduct manager for word processors at Microsoft Corp. in Redmond, Wash.andM;&quot;This feature marks each deletion and insertion that you make to an existingdocument, so you can clearly see the differences between various versions ofa document.&quot;andM;Paul Anacker, the chairman for Lawyers in Mensa Inc., a subsidiary of MensaInc. in Ventura, Calif., lists three other features lawyers may findimportant: a legal dictionary, document-assembly capabilities and on-screenline numbering are all essential.andM;&quot;IBM's DisplayWrite 3 provides excellent document-assembly capabilities,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;It lets you identify and merge paragraphs to form a document based oninformation stored in a client database.andP;  Such a feature is especiallyimportant for wills and complaint letters.andM;&quot;Many of the features a lawyer needs can often be purchased as add-ons toword-processing packages,&quot; Anacker added.andP;  &quot;One thing lawyers do not need aredesktop-publishing functions.andP;  No one requires that a contract be laid outwith multiple fonts.&quot;andM;&quot;There are many people in corporate America who perform financial analysisand integrate numbers -- bankers, accountants and the like,&quot; said Microsoft'sReingold.andM;These users, he said, should be matched with word processors that can easilyhandle tables of numbers, and can set up numeric tabs and integrateinformation pulled from spreadsheets.andM;Word processors used in offices with local or wide area networks cancontribute to departmental cooperation.andM;As Ostroff, the consultant, noted: &quot;Both WordPerfect and Microsoft Wordprovide capabilities for work-group functions.andP;  WordPerfect Office is anextension to WordPerfect that provides powerful tools that allow differentpieces from different workers in the department to be sent to a centraleditor on the network who creates a single manuscript by combining all thecontributions of the group.&quot;andM;Microsoft Word &quot;takes a peer-to-peer approach, in which tools are providedthat allow lots of people to work on the same document at the same time,&quot;Ostroff  added.andM;Debra Berk, owner of DMB Computing Services of Coventry, N.Y., providesword-processing services for small businesses and graduate students.andP;  Much ofher time is devoted to creating technical documents.andP;  Topping her list ofword-processing demands are equation editing and support for Greek andmathematical character sets.andM;Berk chooses from an arsenal of word processors, depending on the task athand.andP;  &quot;When I have to do a lot of scientific equations or oddball spacings,I use WordPerfect.andP;  When I have to use many different fonts, I use[Ashton-Tate's] Framework III.andP;  WordPerfect is a nice product, but it has somany menus and options that it can be confusing.andP;  In addition, WordPerfectdoes too many things automatically.andP;  I would like to be able to control itbetter,&quot; she said.andM;Writers and others who spend a lot of time organizing information may find anoutlining feature invaluable.andP;  But, as Ostroff said, not all outliners arecreated equal.andM;&quot;Microsoft Word provides an excellent outliner that allows documents to bedisplayed as either outlines or as documents,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;WordStar'soutliner, on the other hand, is a separate module that is not integrated intothe main package.andP;  WordPerfect says it does outlining, but in fact it offerslittle more than automatic paragraph handling.&quot;andM;In order to create advanced presentations with a minimum of effort, considerproducts that offer good style sheets; they make major formatting changes asimple procedure.andM;&quot;Simply change the format in the style sheet, and the look of the wholedocument quickly changes to match,&quot; said Ostroff.andP;  &quot;Another advantage of aproduct with good style sheets is that it allows a talented layout person tocreate style sheets for the whole corporation.andP;  Once this is done, even thosewith no layout skills can produce attractive output.&quot;andM;Microsoft Word, MicroPro International Inc.'s WordStar Professional and XeroxCorp.'s Ventura Publisher &quot;all offer style sheets in the true sense of theterm -- their style sheets hold formatting attributes that can be applied toany properly tagged paragraph,&quot; Ostroff said.andM;&quot;WordStar 2000 also claims to offer style sheets,&quot; he said, &quot;but, in thiscase, you can't change your initial format and have all the documents createdunder that sheet change to reflect the format changes.&quot;andM;In the end, it may be possible for the buyer to find a product with theinterface and every other feature he or she desires, except one.andP;  Luckily,word processing is the most competitive of all software applications, andchances are, the missing feature will be added in the next release.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
