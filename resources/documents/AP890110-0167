In its final report to Reagan, the president's Council ofEconomic Advisers said reducing protection for depositors wouldencourage them to more closely ``monitor the financial health'' ofthe institutions holding their money.   But the Treasury Department, through Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio,senior Republican on the House Banking Committee, promptly distanceditself from the latest proposal involving the troubled savingsindustry in which a post-Depression record of more than 200insolvent institutions were closed last year.   At a hearing of the House committee, Wylie said, ``Curtailingdeposit insurance is not an option and will not be considered'' aspart of the Sandamp;L plan being developed by Treasury Secretary NicholasF. Brady, who is staying on in the Bush administration.   Wylie, who said he spoke after his office conferred with theTreasury Department, said Brady will present the plan toPresident-elect Bush by about Feb. 15.   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the committee, didsay a gradual reduction in deposit insurance may be considered aspart of solving the Sandamp;L crisis. But he also said such a proposal``is a very serious matter, not a matter to be thrown out as a trialballoon.''   Other Democratic and Republican members of Congress reaffirmed acommitment to guaranteeing deposits up to the current $100,000 peraccount limit.   ``Congress will stand four-square behind the $100,000agreement,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``I'm appalled at thetiming of the administration. ... I think the public needs somereassurance.''   In its report, released by the White House, the Council ofEconomic Advisers also sharply criticized Reagan-appointed savingsand loan regulators for ``postponing the day of reckoning'' in theirrescues of failed institutions.   ``Most regulatory actions taken so far ... will sharply increasecosts to the general public,'' the report said. Sandamp;L regulators'practice of guaranteeing new owners of rescued Sandamp;Ls against lossesfor up to 10 years weakens the incentive to manage efficiently, itsaid.   The top regulator, M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal HomeLoan Bank Board, defended his agency's year-end spate of savings andloan bailouts as cheaper than shutting down the failed institutionsand paying off depositors.   Wall told the committee that his agency rescued 75 institutionsin December at a cost of $15.5 billion to be spread out over 10years. Tax benefits arising from the deals will cost the governmentan additional $4 billion.   Liquidating the Sandamp;Ls and shutting them down would have required$47 billion in ``up-front cash,'' far more than is availableimmediately to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., Wallsaid. However, by selling off the property of the failed Sandamp;Ls,regulators eventually would have recouped all but $22.8 billion onthe December transactions, he said.   Wall and fellow bank board members Roger Martin and LawrenceWhite cited two benefits of rescuing institutions now and spreadingout the cost rather than waiting to accumulate the money forliquidations.   First, Wall said, the bank board stopped the operating losses atthe rescued institutions. Second, it eased the need for theinstitutions to pay above-market interest rates to attractdepositors. That in turn eases the pressure on still-healthy Sandamp;Ls tocompete by raising their rates.   For all of 1988, including December, the bank board committedmore than $38 billion to resolve the cases of 205 institutions, Wallsaid.   Several members of the committee expressed outrage that in somedeals, buyers of failed institutions are to receive tax benefitsworth more than the private money they are to put into rescuedinstitutions.   ``The dealmakers who are walking away with more cash than they'reputting in from day 1 are laughing all the way to the piggybank,''Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, told Wall. ``The acquirers have robbed youblind.''   Reagan's council, noting estimates up to $100 billion for solvingthe Sandamp;L problem, said ``a large portion of the payment of this billwill need to come directly from the public.'' The report did not saytax money would have to be spent, but many private analysts believethat is inevitable.   In the final Reagan budget, released Monday, the administrationcalled for spending $64 billion on Sandamp;Ls through 1994 andacknowledged for the first time that the government does not haveenough money coming in from the industry and other sources to handlethe cleanup.   Citing the 1980 decision by Congress to boost the limit ondeposit insurance from $40,000 to $100,000, Reagan's economicadvisers said reducing the ceiling ``would restore much-neededdiscipline to the system.''   ``The scope of federal deposit insurance should be significantlycurtailed,'' it said. However, it did not recommend a specificlimit, nor did it say whether the curtailment should apply toexisting deposits or only to future deposits.   Deposit insurance discourages bank runs and provides individualswith a safe place for their money, but it ``also dramaticallyreduces the incentives for depositors to monitor the financialhealth of their bank,'' the report said.   The council's chairman, Beryl Sprinkel, said at the White House,``Clearly, there is a big price to be paid, and some funds wereallocated by the president's last budget; additional will benecessary in the future. But if we concentrate only on the price tobe paid and do not concentrate on reforming the industry, in myopinion, it will be a temporary stopgap measure that will lead torepeated losses in the future.''   According to the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, 13.3percent of all Sandamp;L accounts at the end of 1987 exceeded theinsurance limit. However, the average account had $8,440.</TEXT></DOC>
