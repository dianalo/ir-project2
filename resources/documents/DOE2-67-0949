Constitution: In a nuclearreactor control rod having a neutron absorption tube comprising boroncarbide neutron absorbents contained in a metal tubular member, the Caxis direction of boron carbide crystals is made vertical to the neutronabsorption tube. The boron carbide has a rhombic crystal structure, andit is equivalent to hexagonal crystal system having the plane distancein the C axis direction of 21.1 A and the plane distance in the {alpha}axis direction is 5.6 A. The volume of boron carbide single crystal latticeis increased along with the increase of the irradiation dose by the effectof knock-on atoms due to fast neutrons and the effect of {alpha}-particlessuch as /sup 10/B(n,{alpha}), /sup 7/Li about at a temperature of lightwater-reactors. In this case, the plane distance in the direction ofthe crystallographic axis C is decreased while the plane distance inthe {alpha}-direction increased. Thus, the C axis is made vertical tothe absorption tube to prevent the interactions. (Kamimura, M.).</TEXT></DOC>
