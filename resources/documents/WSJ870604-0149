But critics say the agreement might be going too far.    Specifically, the agreement, which requires the approval of the federal Parliament and the provincial legislatures, settles some of Quebec's longstanding constitutional grievances.    For example, the agreement recognizes Quebec as &quot;a distinct society&quot; within Canada -- something it has sought as a constitutional protection for its French language and for its culture.    It also gives the provinces more say in determining national programs and provincial jurisdiction.    Critics, including former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, alleged Mr. Mulroney paid too steep a price to get Quebec and the other provinces to sign the pact; he warned that if the agreement is accepted, it &quot;will render the Canadian state totally impotent.&quot;    When Mr. Trudeau was prime minister, he refused special status for Quebec because of his concern it could encourage independence movements in the province.    Mr. Mulroney and the provincial leaders agreed in principle on the planned constitutional amendments April 30. But final wording of the agreement was difficult to work out because of the constitutional complexity of various issues -- including Quebec's demands for special status. The wording was settled only after overnight negotiations that ended yesterday morning.    Quebec, until this year, had boycotted constitutional discussions as a protest against 1982 constitutional changes that failed to meet its aspirations.    &quot;Today we welcome Quebec back to the Canadian constitutional family,&quot; said Mr. Mulroney, who received prolonged applause in Parliament after the agreement was signed.    Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa said he believed the designation of Quebec as a &quot;distinct society&quot; would help the province defend existing Quebec laws protecting the French language and culture.    Mr. Mulroney was able to get other provinces to accept special constitutional status for Quebec by agreeing to deal with some of their constitutional concerns -- including reform of the Senate, the upper chamber of the federal Parliament whose members are appointed.    The prime minister agreed that until Senate reforms are implemented, future senators will be appointed from candidate lists provided by the provinces. The appointments are currently the prerogative of the prime minister.    Mr. Mulroney said he will make a Senate reform proposal to the provinces next year.    The agreement also requires the federal government to make its Supreme Court appointments from candidate lists proposed by the provinces.    A federal government official said the accord also gives provinces more clout in determining future national programs that are funded jointly by the provinces and the federal government, and that are in areas of provincial jurisdiction.    Several of the provincial leaders took issue with allegations that they are grabbing power from the federal government. &quot;I'm not a feudal landlord,&quot; said Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford. </TEXT></DOC>
