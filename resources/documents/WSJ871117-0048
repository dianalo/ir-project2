Basic industrial prices are posting percentage increases not seen in five years. And although last month's stock market crash has raised the specter of a business slump, there seems little evidence that it damped these inflationary pressures.    The price rises have implications, economists note, for the Federal Reserve Board's interest rate policy as it balances inflation with fears of recession induced by the market crash.    The Labor Department reported Friday that the Producer Price Index for finished goods fell by 0.2% in October. But the decline largely reflected a drop in the price of energy and food. Other components, such as raw materials, showed steep advances in October. Prices of goods in the intermediate stage of production -- such as steel, aluminum, chemicals, paper and rubber -- rose 0.5%. Had food and energy been excluded, the index for intermediate goods would have risen 0.9%, or more than 10% on an annual basis.    Price increases for intermediate goods have historically worked through to finished-product prices within &quot;six to 12 months,&quot; says Geoffrey H. Moore, who heads Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle Research.    If that prospect proves paramount in the Fed's policy councils, then the nation's central bank is likely to keep interest rates high. That would support the dollar, but tend to slow both business activity and the correction in the trade deficit needed to stimulate American exports. Should the Fed discount the inflation signal, it could ease interest rates, putting downward pressure on the dollar.    The rise in prices of industrial goods should warn the Federal Reserve Board to be &quot;cautious&quot; in any move to ease interest rates, says Lyle Gramley, a former Fed governor and chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. Rising along with industrial prices are private-sector labor costs, accompanied by a shortage of skilled workers, all inflationary, says Mr. Gramley. &quot;You can be sure the Fed is watching these increases closely,&quot; he says.    Consider:   --Steel: Since early this year, prices have stopped falling and have climbed as much as $40 a ton, or 12%. Producers are starting to renegotiate long-term contracts with powerful customers such as auto makers, which until now had flexed their muscles to push down their purchase costs.    --Aluminum: Prices have recently been exploding so much that Reynolds Metals Co. isn't even quoting prices until close to delivery. In fact, the company, which has announced further price increases since the stock market crash, is allocating supplies to its customers for the first time in years.    --Tires: Cooper Tire andamp; Rubber Co. recently announced the third increase in its base prices this year. &quot;We're striving to maintain the current cost-price relationship&quot; and need &quot;to keep pace with cost increases in raw materials,&quot; says Ivan W. Gorr, president of the Findlay, Ohio, company.    --Plastics and chemicals: In the past seven months, plastics prices have surged 20% and industrial chemicals 10%. Dow Chemical Co. recently eliminated its customary discounts on certain products for premium customers, and a spokesman said the stock market plunge isn't affecting the company's pricing plans.    In addition to rising prices of industrial goods, the falling dollar, down 50% from its March 1985 highs against the Japanese yen and German mark, is also contributing to inflation. In the auto industry, for example, exchange rate adjustments have pushed foreign auto makers to raise prices 25% in the past two years, enabling U.S. producers to post double-digit price increases this year. One Commerce Department official estimates that the latest price increases by the Big Three on 1988 models averaged about 10%.    Columbia's Mr. Moore says metals are putting particular &quot;upward pressure&quot; on prices. He notes that although some metals prices declined in the aftermath of the market crash, they're still considerably above their year-ago levels. Citing statistics compiled by the Journal of Commerce, he said that as of Friday, the industrial-materials price index was up 9% from the average for last year, including rises of 12.3% for textiles and 19% for metals. By comparison, the index actually fell in 1986 and 1985, Mr. Moore says.    Like many of his fellow economists, he worries that policy makers and businessmen are growing complacent about the current annual inflation rate, which is running a little under 5%. &quot;Certainly the economy isn't showing signs of weakening. If inflation was a problem before (the stock market crash), it is a problem now,&quot; says Kenneth Militzer, chief economist at American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. Moreover, many manufacturers &quot;have cut capacity to the point where it doesn't take much of an increase in demand to make a shortage a reality,&quot; says Robert Rowan, chairman of Fruehauf Corp., which makes truck trailers and auto parts.    Reynolds Metals, for instance, closed four of its eight aluminum smelters between 1982 and 1985. Recently, it also shuttered fabricating facilities. The aluminum industry -- which ships its products to auto makers, aircraft manufacturers, and the appliance and building industries -- has worked off nearly 1.2 billion pounds of excess inventory since 1982. Now, the industry is working at close to capacity, and the price of primary aluminum has shot up to 82 cents a pound from 50 cents early this year.    Supplies are so tight that Reynolds, the second-largest U.S. aluminum producer, is allocating supplies to customers. &quot;Last time we did that was in the 1970s and early 1980s,&quot; says William Bourke, president and chief operating officer. &quot;We expect fairly balanced supply and demand through 1988,&quot; he says, contending that the recent aluminum price increases are justified.    Similar price explosions have been occuring in other metals, such as copper and zinc. &quot;Industries using these metals face a tough decision: whether to sign long-term contracts that lock in today's prices or gamble that prices will drop,&quot; says Peter Merner, an aluminum analyst.    Steel prices still seem to be rising in the face of the stock market turmoil. On Oct. 20, the day after stocks plunged, Bethlehem Steel Corp. increased prices of some sheet steel used in cars and appliances by $30 a ton, or 6%, effective in January. Bethlehem already has raised prices three times this year. In addition, steelmakers seek still higher prices from the auto makers. In the past five years, American auto companies have obtained long-term steel contracts with stable to lower prices. But those contracts expire early next year. &quot;We expect to come to the table to seek price improvements,&quot; says Thomas C. Graham, president of USS, the steelmaking division of USX Corp. &quot;There has been a subtle shift of balance in our pricing power.&quot;    That may sound like bargaining rhetoric, but Mr. Graham is right. USS, which has shed seven million tons of capacity since 1986 alone, is operating at 85% of capacity, up from 66% in the first half of last year. That rate might go higher, if USS can capitalize on the weak dollar -- which has made U.S. companies low-cost producers even in comparison with such efficient producers as the Japanese -- and follow through on its plans to export steel.    In contrast to the previous economic expansion, producers in many industries now are reluctant to increase capacity to meet strong demand -- a move that would relieve the price pressure. &quot;The overbuilding in the 1970s has a lot of people very cautious,&quot; says Bernard Butcher, a vice president of Dow Chemical of Midland, Mich. &quot;I don't think we have the stomach to go through another binge of restructuring. At the end of 1985, we took a $600 million write-down.&quot; Thus, Dow Chemical, operating close to capacity because of increased domestic and overseas demand, is &quot;squeezing out&quot; extra production, instead of building new plants.    Meanwhile, Mr. Butcher says, Dow has raised prices an average of 5% to 6% from last year, &quot;and the price curve is still rising.&quot; In consequence, &quot;We haven't signed fixed-price long-term contracts&quot; all year, he adds.    Atop all this, economists worry that labor-cost increases will accelerate. Wages and benefits haven't risen sharply so far, largely because of the severity of the last recession and American manufacturers' continued push to slash their work forces. But with unemployment down to about 5.9% -- slightly above what some economists consider full employment -- &quot;the expectation is growing that wages will increase,&quot; says Michael Wachter, a labor economist at the University of Pennsylvania. &quot;Wage increases aren't part of inflation yet,&quot; he says, &quot;but I expect wages to rise between 5% and 6%&quot; next year from the current 3.3%. Predicts Joel Popkin, Washington-based economic consultant, &quot;We're going to see more increases in intermediate goods prices plus wage costs picking up in the first quarter of next year,&quot; prompting the Fed to &quot;tighten credit policy.&quot;    Economists also worry about oil prices. After their 1987 peak in late July, prices have leveled off and are even showing signs of softening, reflecting high inventories and overproduction in the Mideast. But escalating skirmishes in the Persian Gulf could change the bright outlook for the major component in the nation's inflation measure.    Leaving combat aside, oil industry executives wonder how long the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will hold world oil prices at $18 a barrel in the face of a declining dollar. As the dollar falls, OPEC's real revenues decline in terms of what its members can buy from Japanese and other Asian exporters. Although Saudi Arabia, OPEC's leading producer, has said it wants to keep the $18 price, oilmen remember that it was the dollar's decline in the early 1970s that started the last major round of OPEC increases from about $2 a barrel to almost $40. </TEXT></DOC>
