Until recently, criminals were succeeding in hiding many of theirtransactions with computers and fax machines. But then investigatorslearned how to tap the fax phone line, Santucci said.   In raids Wednesday and Thursday, city police and prosecutorsarrested 40 men and women at 17 fake storefronts and two apartments,seized $50,000 in cash and 80 slot machines, computers and phones.   ``There was a time when the work was carried in brown paperbags,'' said police Inspector Frank Biehler. ``These vast amounts ofmoney are beyond manual means. Fax machines eliminate people havingto carry gambling records through the streets.''   Infiltrating the operation was difficult because ``this isbasically the first time we've found such sophisticated computerequipment in a numbers operation,'' Biehler said.   Among those arrested were alleged associates of the Gambinoorganized crime family, including Carmelo Amato, 35, of ValleyStream, N.Y., Santucci said.   The raids ``made a serious dent in the Gambino crime family,'' hesaid.   But authorities said the raids would do little to curb thepublic's appetite for the illegal business.   ``There's still a part of the public that insists on doingbusiness with the illegal bookmakers,'' Santucci said. ``We closethem today and unless we get really successful, they're open againtomorrow.''</TEXT></DOC>
