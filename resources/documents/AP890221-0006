From student radicals yelling ``Yankee Go Home'' to farmersdenouncing U.S. agriculture imports, South Koreans are venting theirfrustration and anger at one of their oldest allies.   When President Bush visits Seoul next Monday, he will find whatone newspaper warns is a society ``quite different'' from the one hesaw as vice president in April 1982.   ``Don't Come to Korea, Bush!'' yell radical students, punctuatingthe words with raised, clenched fists.   Criticism of the United States is no longer relegated to privateconversation. American flags are torched and effigies of Uncle Samor Bush are burned.   Some 12,000 angry farmers battled thousands of riot police withclubs and firebombs outside the National Assembly this month anddenounced the United States for trying to force open South Korea'sagricultural market.   Radical students staged a series of attacks on U.S. facilities todemand an end to American influence. They vowed to hold nationwideanti-government, anti-U.S. demonstrations to coincide with thepresident's visit.   ``Arson, violence, destruction and lawlessness cannot betolerated,'' said President Roh Tae-woo in demanding an end toprotests.   Every U.S. president since the Korean War except Richard Nixonhas visited Seoul but none has come during a time of more publicanimosity against Washington policies.   Businessmen, laborers, and students who have never thrown afirebomb are heard to complain that South Korea is victimized byunfair trade pressures and rude, Yankee arrogance.   When asked their nationality by a Korean, U.S. citizens rarelyacknowledge that they are American. The U.S. embassy and the U.S.military have cautioned citizens against wearing clothing whichlabels them from the U.S.A.   ``The United States is no longer a sacred cow,'' said a westerndiplomat, requesting anonymity. ''America is no longer the patronsaint of South Korea.''   ``The United States has played roles in past dictatorialgovernments and we oppose the visit of U.S. President Bush,'' claimsa labor alliance demanding investigations into corruption and humanrights abuses of the past U.S.-supported authoritarian government.   A few weeks ago, the United States said it was consideringclosing its cultural center in the provincial capital of Kwangju,180 miles south of Seoul, because of repeated violent attacks andconcern for the safety of its staff.   Kwangju was the scene of a bloody nine-day civil uprising in1980. Many opposition and dissident figures claim the United Statesshared responsibility for the Kwangju incident by acquiescing in amilitary-backed South Korean government plan to quell the uprising.The United States denied the charge.   Although public protests appear outwardly to have scant impact onrelations and radicals have little public support, governmentleaders warn that growing anti-American sentiment could endangerSouth Korea's interests in Washington.   The government lost no time in apologizing publicly for theKwangju center attacks and appealed to radical students ``not todamage traditional Korea-U.S. friendship.''   The assistant foreign minister, Kim Suk-kyu, reflects thethinking of many when he says anti-Americanism ``is a minority viewand a passing phenomenon, despite loud voices and anti-Americanactivists.''   More than half of South Korea's 40 million people have been bornsince the Korean War ended 35 years ago, and long time observerslink the intensity of anti-American feeling to the age of theparticipant. The younger the person, the more likely he or she is tofeel the United States has taken its relationship with South Koreafor granted.   The Korean peninsula has been divided into the capitalist southand the communist north since the end of World War II in 1945. TheUnited States helped South Korea fight the 1950-53 Korean Waragainst the north and keeps 42,000 troops stationed in the southunder a mutual defense pact.   Radical students and dissidents feel the presence of U.S. troopsstand in the way of unification talks with the north and havedemanded the withdrawal of all U.S. forces. They also demand thehalt to this year's joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises called``Team Spirit.''   A more realistic relationship is needed between the twogovernments, say both protesters and some politicians, arelationship which recognizes South Korea's economic potential andplace in global politics.   The United States is Seoul's leading trade partner. Korea soldAmerica goods worth $8 billion more than it bought from the UnitedStates last year. Considerable pressure has been placed on theKoreans to liberalize their import regulations to help balance thedeficit.   Anti-American comment became acceptable socially after lastfall's Olympic Games when South Koreans of all ages had theirfrustration and resentment against the United States stoked by whatthey regarded as unruly behavior of U.S. athletes and biasedcoverage by NBC.</TEXT></DOC>
