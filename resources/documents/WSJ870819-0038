Kongsberg's executive vice president for marketing, Jens Width, said the company received a telex Friday from the Pentagon saying that the U.S. wouldn't sign any more such contracts either with it or with Japan's Toshiba Corp. &quot;until further notice.&quot;    In Washington, the Pentagon confirmed it has deferred doing any new business with Kongsberg and Toshiba until questions are settled about their responsibility for the illegal sale of technologically advanced milling machinery to the Soviet Union. But a spokesman said Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger had laid down the unofficial policy &quot;several months ago.&quot; He added that he hadn't any knowledge of any recent message sent by the Pentagon to either company.    Toshiba officials in Japan couldn't be reached immediately to comment on the reports of the suspension.    Kongsberg officials said the decision in the U.S. apparently stems from the Pentagon's concern that Congress may ban trade with Kongsberg and Toshiba for selling the militarily sensitive machine-tool equipment to a Leningrad shipyard in 1982. The Senate voted 92-5 at the end of June to bar the two concerns from selling almost any product in the U.S. for at least two years, and the House will consider a similar measure later this year. In another punitive action, the U.S. Commerce Department last month temporarily suspended both companies' authority to ship U.S. products.    In addition, Mr. Width said, the telex said that even if Kongsberg or Toshiba offered the lowest bids for new U.S. defense orders, the secretary or undersecretary of defense would have to approve awarding a contract to either concern. The Pentagon's action doesn't cover existing contracts with the two companies, Mr. Width said.    In Oslo, Defense Ministry spokesman Erik Senstad said his government would seek clarification from Washington of the Pentagon's telex.    &quot;It's a little bit hard to say how far this message goes,&quot; Mr. Senstad said. &quot;But what is difficult for Kongsberg is difficult for the government. They are important to us.&quot;    Kongsberg wouldn't be immediately affected by the Pentagon's decision, Mr. Width said, though its future marketing plans might be. He said the company wasn't discussing any new orders with the U.S. and hasn't bid on any contracts outstanding.    The only significant U.S. contract involving Kongsberg is a government-to-government agreement for it to supply modified Penguin anti-ship missiles to the U.S. Navy for use on its Seahawk helicopters. That contract is valued at about 300 million Norwegian kroner ($44 million) and carries an option for an additional 160 missiles valued at about 700 million kroner, Mr. Width said.    Since the end of last year, Kongsberg has been engaged in a group restructuring aimed at disposing of unprofitable or marginal operations that contributed to seven consecutive years of losses. Last year, despite a cash injection from the state of 200 million kroner, Kongsberg incurred a loss of 718 million kroner on sales of 2.15 billion kroner.    The measure passed by the Senate in June, in addition to banning imports into the U.S. of Kongsberg and Toshiba products, would bar contracts between them and the entire U.S. government. </TEXT></DOC>
