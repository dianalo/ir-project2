Elsewhere on Sunday, black activist Winnie Mandela also violatedstate of emergency rules by calling for increased internationaleconomic sanctions against South Africa.   Tutu, in a service at St. George's Cathedral in Cape Town,described the elections as ``ludicrous'' and ``unjust'' and saidthe government was attempting to ``force participation.''   ``I urge black people in this diocese not to vote in the Octoberelections and I hope that white Anglicans would join their blackfellow Anglicans in that action,'' said Tutu, winner of the 1984Nobel Peace Prize.   ``I am aware of the penalties attached to this call. I am notdefying the government, I am obeying God,'' the black churchmansaid.   Whites, blacks, Asians and people of mixed-race will holdseparate elections Oct. 26 to choose local officials. The blackmajority has no vote in national affairs, although the nation's 26million blacks make up about 75 percent of South Africa'spopulation.   Under the 26-month-old state of emergency it is illegal to callfor an election boycott in South Africa. If convicted, violatorsmay be fined or imprisoned.   In the 1984 municipal elections, anti-apartheid groups promotedelection boycotts and only about 10 percent of eligible blackvoters went to the polls.   Many black activists view black elected officials ascollaborators with the white-dominated government and its apartheidpolicies of racial separation.   Tutu said calling for an election boycott was a legitimate``non-violent way of expressing our opposition to the evil andinjustice of apartheid.''   ``You cannot get security through the barrel of a gun, northrough the draconian and oppressive state of emergency,'' he said.   Tutu spoke at a special service to install Canon Colin Jones asdean of St. George's Cathedral. Jones, 37, becomes the first blackto serve in the post. He spent last year in Portland, Ore., andmost recently was the chaplin at the University of the WesternCape, a mixed-race school.   Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok has threatened to clampdown on anti-apartheid clergymen.   ``We must clip their wings _ as we clipped those of the 19revolutionary and activist organizations,'' Vlok said on Friday inreference to the government's February decision banning mostleading anti-apartheid groups.   Anti-government church leaders were among the few prominentresistence figures spared in the crackdown, and they now are themost visible domestic opponents of the government.   Mrs. Mandela called for increased economic sanctions in a speechat the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.   ``When we call for sanctions, when we call for disinvestmentfrom this country, it is because we are looking for those peacefulmeasures as an alternative to the structural violence of the statewe see today,'' she said.   Mrs. Mandela spoke to 400 people gathered to mark thepublication of a biography on her husband, jailed African NationalCongress leader Nelson Mandela. The book, entitled ``Higher ThanHope,'' was written by South African academic Fatima Meer, who alsowas present.   The 70-year-old Mandela, South Africa's best known black leader,is in a Cape Town clinic recuperating from tuberculosis.   He has been imprisoned for 26 years and is serving a lifesentence for sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government.The ANC is the major guerrilla group fighting white minority rule.</TEXT></DOC>
