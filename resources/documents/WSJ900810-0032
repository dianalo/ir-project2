Jeffer, a former NewYork money manager, and Mr. Glauberman's sister, LoriGlauberman, a former associate director in the preferredstock department of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. in New York. Tradingin these deals, which occurred between February 1984 andJanuary 1988, netted the participants in the ring more than$4 million, the government said.   Mr. Glauberman allegedly continued to pass insideinformation to Mr. Smith even after investment bankers DennisLevine and Martin Siegel and former stock speculator Ivan F.Boesky pleaded guilty to insider trading-related charges in1986 and 1987.   Mr. Glauberman, 39 years old, Lori Glauberman, 36, and Mr.Jeffer, 44, have signed consent decrees issued by the SECand, without admitting or denying guilt, agreed to pay backthe allegedly unlawful profits they earned from the scheme.They have also agreed to be permanently barred from thesecurities industry.   Messrs. Glauberman and Jeffer also waived their right tobe indicted by a federal grand jury and were charged in afive-count document, known as an information. Mr. Glaubermanwas charged with four counts of conspiracy, insider tradingand wire fraud. Mr. Jeffer was charged with one count ofinsider trading. They haven't pleaded guilty to the criminalcharges, but it is understood that they have agreed to at alater date.   Mr. Smith, who was the principal broker at Smith Barneyfor Mr. Jeffer's money-management firm, the now-defunctJeffer Management Corp., and Stanley Patrick, a trader atJeffer Management, were charged in a 10-count indictmenthanded up yesterday by a federal grand jury here. The twowere charged with conspiracy and insider trading. Accordingto the indictment, Mr. Smith provided insider trading tips toMr. Patrick, who used the information to buy and sellsecurities for his own and client accounts.   Each of the 15 counts carries a maximum penalty of fiveyears in jail and a fine of $250,000, which would total abouttwice the profits earned through the alleged scheme.   The SEC first began investigating the alleged trading ringin 1987. According to a 56-page complaint filed by the SEC inNew York yesterday, Mr. Glauberman, through his job, learnedinformation about tender offers, mergers, leveraged buy-outsand other transactions but was obligated to keep the dataconfidential.   Mr. Glauberman met Mr. Smith in 1981, when Mr. Smithbecame Mr. Glauberman's broker, and the two became closefriends, according to the SEC complaint. Mr. Glauberman begangiving Mr. Smith inside information concerning deals Skaddenwas working on in January 1984, according to the SEC. In thenext five years, Mr. Smith conducted illegal trades based onthe data in as many as eight brokerage accounts hecontrolled, the SEC said.   In exchange for the information he received from Mr.Glauberman, Mr. Smith put $50,000 into a special tradingaccount established in April 1985 for Mr. Glauberman'sbenefit. That account traded actively but was liquidated inJuly 1987, a day after Mr. Glauberman and his sister receivedsubpoenas to testify before the SEC staff, according to theSEC.   Mr. Glauberman allegedly gave Mr. Smith information ondeals he and others at Skadden worked on. Among those dealswere General Motors Corp.'s successful 1984 bid forElectronic Data Systems Inc., in which Skadden representedGM, and Chesebrough Ponds Inc.'s 1985 offer for StaufferChemical Inc., in which Skadden represented Chesebrough.   Between 1984 and 1986, Mr. Glauberman also allegedly gaveinformation on the possible bids for EDS, Signal Cos., MaryKay Cosmetics Inc. and other companies to his sister, whomade $19,135 on the transactions, according to the SEC.   The SEC has also charged Jeffer Management, AnthonyCorrera and Mr. Patrick in its complaint. It said Mr. Smithmet Mr. Jeffer in October 1984, and Mr. Smith told Mr. Jefferto buy certain securities based on information Mr. Smithallegedly received from Mr. Glauberman. Mr. Smith allegedlyprofited on the commissions from those trades.   Mr. Correra, a research analyst at Jeffers Management, andMr. Patrick, allegedly learned of Mr. Smith's tips and alsobegan trading for their own accounts through him.   The SEC said Mr. Correra has agreed to be barred from thesecurities industry, but may reapply after four years.   Earl Yaffa, managing director of Skadden, said the lawfirm believes that &quot;we and our clients have been violated.&quot;Mr. Yaffa said, &quot;Steve was a trusted member of our mergersand acquisitions group, and he understood the policies andviolated the trust we put in him.&quot;   Mr. Glauberman, a graduate of Princeton University and NewYork University Law School, joined the law firm in 1981. WhenSkadden learned of the investigation in the autumn of 1988,it told him to leave its offices, but continued to pay him.The law firm fired Mr. Glauberman in July, when it was toldthat he would be charged. Colleagues at Skadden say Mr.Glauberman insisted throughout the lengthy investigation thathe was innocent.   Mr. Glauberman didn't return calls, and his attorneywasn't available to comment. Robert Anello, an attorney forMr. Smith, declined to comment. Lawyers for Ms. Glaubermanand for Messrs. Jeffer, Correra and Patrick didn't returncalls.   A spokesman for Smith Barney, a unit of Primerica Corp.,said, &quot;The investigation commenced after Mr. Smith left ourfirm. We cooperated fully with the SEC in the investigation.&quot;   William McLucas, SEC enforcement chief, said the case was&quot;the product of years of dogged investigative work and wasput together piece of paper by piece of paper.&quot; The probe wasprincipally led by Eric Seltzer, an SEC branch chief, andassistant U.S. Attorney Stephen C. Robinson.   According to individuals familiar with the matter, thegovernment didn't file criminal charges against LoriGlauberman as part of its plea pact with her brother.   Other Skadden clients about which Mr. Glauberman isaccused of revealing inside information include MorganStanley Group Inc., SCA Services Inc., Allied Corp., Pay LessDrug Stores Northwest Inc. and Blount Inc.   Legal experts said Skadden isn't likely to bear anyliability for Mr. Glauberman's actions. He had signed astatement agreeing that he had a duty to keep informationlearned at the law firm confidential.   In 1987, Ilan K. Reich, formerly a partner with Wachtell,Lipton, Rosen andamp; Katz, pleaded guilty to federal securitiesfraud charges in connection with a profit-sharing arrangementwith Mr. Levine. Mr. Reich served time in jail and wasdisbarred.   ---   William Power contributed to this article.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          STEVEN L.
