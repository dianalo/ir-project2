(digital signal processor)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Scanlan, Jim.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Greater integration and faster performance of new generations ofsubmicron CMOS and BiCMOS digital signal processors (DSPs) aredriving their applications in such high-volume commercial marketsas mobile cellular phones, which is expected to grow from thecurrent 5.7 million units to 22 million by 1995.andP;  Conversely, theeconomies of scale of the cellular and other high-volume marketsare expected to bring the cost of DSPs down.andP;  Digital cellulartelephones are the largest new market for DSP chips and,consequently, are motivating many new DSP designs.andP;  Particularfeatures of the new cellular-oriented DSP chips include theaddition of analog-to-digital converter circuitry and coreprocessor memory and peripherals optimized for cellularapplications.andP;  Several exemplifying chips are briefly discussed.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Digital Signal ProcessingTrendsApplicationsMarket AnalysisGrowthProductsIntegrated circuitsCellular radio.andO;Feature:   illustrationgraph.andO;Caption:   Worldwide DSP applications: 1989 worldwide market: $270 million.andO;(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
