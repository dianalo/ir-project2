U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson said the settlement wasfundamentally fair and highly favorable to the attendants despiteobjections from six women whose damage claims were fully orpartially denied.   The settlement will be shared by 117 women who were suspended,fired or denied promotions because of the weight policy, saidKathleen King, an attorney for the Independent Union of FlightAttendants.   Pan Am also agreed to liberalize weight standards for current orfuture employees.   The former policy used a 1959 insurance company table of heightsand weights, but judged men under the standard for large frames andwomen under the standard for medium frames. A 5-foot-7 woman wasallowed to weigh 139 pounds under the medium standard, but wouldhave been allowed to weigh 150 under the large standard.   The flight attendants' union sued Pan Am in 1984, and won aruling from Henderson three years later in a non-jury trial thatthe policy was biased.   The ruling was the first to find discrimination by an airlinethat had weight policies for both men and women, Pan Am attorneyRichard Schoolman said at the time.   Henderson ordered the airline to use a large-frame standard forall employees hired while the policy was in effect, through the endof 1984.   Pan Am appealed Henderson's ruling, denying it haddiscriminated. The appeal is being dropped as part of thesettlement, without any admission of discrimination.   The settlement retains Henderson's previous order on weightstandards and also increases some of the standards adopted by theairline in 1985, when it started setting weight requirementsaccording to an employee's individual build. In addition, womenhired after 1985 get another three-pound allowance at ages 35, 45and 55.   Although $2.5 million was less than the women might have gottenin individual damage claims, Henderson said it was reasonable inlight of the time an appeal would have taken and the risk that theentire amount would have been thrown out on appeal.</TEXT></DOC>
