Much ofthe epidemiologic evidence is preliminary in nature and the methods ofprevious studies have been criticized. In order to further evaluate thishypothesis, a population-based case-control study of adult acute nonlymphocyticleukemia and residential exposure to power-frequency magnetic fieldswas carried out in western Washington state. Analyses were based on 114cases who were newly diagnosed from 1981 to 1984 and identified froma population-based cancer registry, and 133 controls who were chosenfrom the study area by random digit dialing. Magnetic field exposurewas estimated from external electrical wiring configurations within 140ft (42.7 m) of each subject's residence. In addition, magnetic fieldswere measured inside the subject's residence at the time of interview.Neither the directly measured magnetic fields nor the surrogate valuesbased on the wiring configurations were associated with acute nonlymphocyticleukemia.</TEXT></DOC>
