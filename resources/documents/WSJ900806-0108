Nevertheless, itwas supported by L. Gordon Crovitz (&quot;Two Cheers for This Billto Reform RICO,&quot; Rule of Law, June 27). &quot;Anything to limitRICO would help,&quot; he argued. Not quite, particularly if thebill would retroactively deprive victims of the Sandamp;L scandal-- as well as other similar frauds -- of effective relief.   In 1970, Congress enacted the Racketeer Influenced andCorrupt Organizations Act. It prohibits patterns ofracketeering activity against various kinds of enterprises,including savings-and-loan associations. Racketeeringactivity, too, includes fraud -- specifically bank fraud. Inaddition to criminal sanctions, RICO -- like the antitruststatutes -- authorized for victims a treble-damages claim forrelief. Like antitrust laws that underwrite freedom in themarketplace, civil RICO underwrites integrity in themarketplace.</LP><TEXT>   And now that those who clearly bear a major blame in theSandamp;L crisis -- real-estate brokers who set up deals,accountants who cooked the books and lawyers who paperedbogus transactions -- may be held accountable in civillitigation, they have come to Congress to ask that they beexempted, retroactively, from the treble-damages provisionsof the law. Notwithstanding a financial crisis ofunparalleled proportions, they make the argument that we needweaker, not stronger, anti-fraud laws.   At their urging, the RICO Amendments Act contains a&quot;gatekeeper&quot; provision designed to winnow out inappropriatecivil litigation. The idea is fundamentally sound, but afight is fast developing in Congress over the size of thegate. The lawyers, accountants and other professionals wantto narrow the gate to let pass through only &quot;majorparticipants,&quot; which would be defined to include only the&quot;trigger men&quot; of the fraud and to exclude those who only&quot;helped&quot; pull the trigger -- the lawyers, accountants andother professionals. In extolling reform at any price, Mr.Crovitz did not tell his readers about this brewing fight,and cheated readers out of the information needed to make uptheir own minds about this important legislation.   Our deepest legal traditions stand squarely againstchanging the substance of legal rights retroactively.Retroactive penal legislation violates the ex post factoclause of the Constitution. Among the founders, Madisonargued eloquently against all retroactive legislation in theFederalist Papers.   RICO may be in need of rewriting as it applies in ordinarycommercial litigation, but it is not in need of such radicalsurgery that would let off the swindlers -- and their lawyersand accountants -- in the current thrift scandal. By makingthe reform retroactive, we would be bailing out the CharlesKeatings and leaving their victims holding the bag, includingMr. Keating's 23,000 bondholders, who were cheated out of$200 million.
