The code of war requires that captured soldiersnot be murdered.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SELECTIVE INDIGNATIONBAKER'S THREAT TO RESUME AID TO EL SALVADOR'SBLOODY REGIME IS PURE HYPOCRISY  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     To go beyond that, to suggest as Secretary of State James Baker did Sundaythat the killings make the case for resumption of full U.S. military aid tothe El Salvador government, is the element of hypocrisy.;    Political murderis the way the civil war in El Salvador is being fought. For Baker to waxindignant at the rebels for &quot;trying to reverse the decision of the ballot boxwith bullets and bayonets&quot; is perception so selective it is laughable.;    Thetactic of choice of the right wing in El Salvador has been political murder,carried out by death squads, usually with the acquiescence if not the outrightconnivance of the military.;    To this government and its army, the UnitedStates has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars for the fight against therebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the FMLN.;    Given the U.S.role, the guerrillas had reason to regard the U.S. soldiers as enemycombatants. They should have treated them as prisoners of war.;    Many ofthose murdered by the right wing were civilians. Sometimes their crime wasspeaking out against the government; other times it was merely merely workingfor a peaceful settlement.;    The particularly shocking murder in November1989 of six priests and two others led a majority of Congress to cut militaryaid to El Salvador in half, to $42.5 million. Now Baker is using the killingof the U.S. soldiers to urge restoration of the other half.;    We hold noaffection for the FMLN. In years past, they waged assassination campaigns todisrupt elections. Both sides in El Salvador are bloody.;    When Congress cutaid, it stipulated restoration if the rebels are not seeking peace and if theyare attacking civilians.;    Those rules miss the point. The United States hasno reason to prop up the government of El Salvador, and many reasons to  cutits military off.;    U.S. aid isn't making anyone in El Salvador freer orsafer.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910109  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  377  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, January 9, 199100009232,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
