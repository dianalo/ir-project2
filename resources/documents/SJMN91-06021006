I knew what he was doing was wrong becausehe gave me candy and little gifts for keeping &quot;our special secret.&quot;;    Themolesting continued for eight years. When I was 14, I felt secure enough totell my mother. When she accused me of lying, I insisted she confront him inmy presence. Even though he admitted everything, she stayed with him. Fromthen on Mom was very cold to me, as if I were the one who caused the problem.I moved out the day I turned 16.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THIS SAD FAMILY HAS TWO VICTIMS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     I am 20 now and find it difficult to be around my mother. I feel that sheabandoned me to save her marriage. Her husband will not allow my name to bespoken in their home. I cannot telephone her for fear that awful man willanswer. He treats her like dirt but she refuses to leave him.;    Ann, isn'tit wrong for my mother to stay married to this animal after what he did to me?Please respond in print. I want several people to see this.;    -- Mary inMichigan;    DEAR MARY -- I can understand your anger and frustration. I know,too, that it is extremely difficult to comprehend why a woman would stay witha man who abused her child and treats her so shabbily.;    Unfortunately, yourmother probably has a pathological fear of being alone. She is willing totolerate anything, rather than be on her own. Sad to say, unless she getsprofessional help she is doomed to spend the rest of her life in that hellishrelationship. Please try to understand that it is not a matter of right orwrong, it's the tragedy of a woman who is an emotional cripple.;    DEAR ANN-- Your recent column answering the question, &quot;What happens to the drugs aftera bust?&quot; was excellent.;    In the past six years, we have confiscated over$1.5 billion from drug traffickers and other criminals. Over 35,000 parcels ofreal and personal property worth more than $1.3 billion have been seized andare being held pending forfeiture.;    It is only fair that these assets bere-invested in law enforcement. We have shared over $560 million with stateand local police agencies, while another $491 million is being used to buildprison cells. Another $268 million has helped finance the anti-drug operationsof the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,the U.S. Marshals Service and other federal agencies.;    We are proud of ourforfeiture program. Thanks for helping get this message out.;    -- DickThornburgh, attorney general, Washington, D.C.;    DEAR ATTORNEY GENERALTHORNBURGH -- The facts and figures cited in your letter were not onlyinformative but very reassuring.
