This year's deluge _ the most devastating in memory _ hasclaimed more than 600 lives by government count and more than 1,400according to newspapers. It has submerged three-quarters of thecountry, spawning disease and destroying homes, roads, bridges,schools and food warehouses.   From the air, Bangladesh looks like a large brown sea withatolls where the map shows cities, towns and villages. Individualrivers can no longer be discerned.   The deluge comes just one year after a flood covered half thecountry and claimed about 300 lives by government count and about1,500 according to newspapers.   Bangladesh, a country born in 1971, is seemingly condemned torepeated disasters.   The 1970-71 war of independence from Pakistan killed 3 millionpeople, according to the government. Since then, floods, cyclonesand tidal waves have claimed at least 20,000 lives. Even in the dryseason, overcrowded river ferries sink regularly, with losses oflife that often exceed 100.   Bangladeshis meet this cycle of tragedy with acceptance thatoften bewilders outsiders and has its roots in the Islamicreligion. Again and again, people lose their homes and theirfamilies, but not their faith. They repeat: ``It is the will ofAllah (God).''   Some of the causes of the disasters are internal, such as abirthrate that has made Bangladesh one of the world's most denselypopulated nations. Others, such as the floods, originate beyond itsborders and beyond its control.   A series of historic shifts drew the borders that defineBangladesh.   When British-ruled India won its independence in 1947, theborders of the Asian subcontinent dissolved and became two newcountries _ predominantly Hindu India and overwhelmingly MoslemEast and West Pakistan.   The division left low-lying Bangladesh, then known as EastPakistan, with little more than an overpopulated river delta barelyabove sea level.   East Pakistan, separated from West Pakistan by 1,000 miles ofIndia, was virtually defenseless against flood waters that cascadefrom the mountains of neighboring India and Nepal.   ``Obviously, India got the better deal,'' said Nazrul Islam,chairman of Dhaka University's geography department. ``I think theyhad stronger negotiators, more money, more knowledgeable andeducated people.''   India got the oil fields of the Assam region, as well as WestBengal with its port of Calcutta, a hub of industry, education andgovernment. East Pakistan got East Bengal _ a region of poorfarmers with rice paddies and jute fields. It also got the poorarea of Assam, including a few tea plantations.   Today, Indian Assam pumps 96,000 barrels of oil a day.Bangladesh finally struck oil there in 1986, but it is only pumpingabout 600 barrels a day.   ``If Pakistan hadn't asked for the area with the Moslems, itwouldn't have gotten Bangladesh,'' said an Indian diplomat whospoke on condition of anonymity. ``Calcutta and the oil were inHindu areas.''   The 1971 civil war, when the Bengali-speaking East Pakistanisrose against their Urdu-speaking rulers from West Pakistan, createdthe independent nation of Bangladesh. But the new nation, free ofthe West Pakistan-based government, was even further deprived ofthe economic strength to combat natural disasters.   Bangladesh has a per capita income of $150 a year, compared to$371 in Pakistan and $260 in India.   The population density is already 2,000 people per square mile,the third highest in the world after the prosperous city-states ofHong Kong and Singapore.   In the past 41 years, Bangladesh's population has swelled from40 million to 110 million. At the present birth rate, thepopulation will double in about 35 years.   After the war of independence, the nation's few resources _ anddefenses against disasters _ were further eroded.   Greedy contractors and poor farmers in search of fuel felledentire forests on the Himalayan slopes in India and Nepal. Thedeforestation eliminated vast tracts that had helped retain floodwaters and held back the silt that clogs the rivers and aggravatesflooding.   Bangladeshis have virtually no place to live except on theplains of rivers that overflow every year, when rain-swollencurrents rush through the width and breadth of Bangladesh to theBay of Bengal.   The mightiest of the rivers _ the Brahmaputra, which starts inChina and flows through Tibet and India, the Ganges, whichoriginates in Nepal and runs through India, and the Meghna, whichrises in India _ are up to 12 miles wide under normal conditionsand spawn hundreds of tributaries.   A cry rose arose from Bangladeshis for regional cooperation tofind an ecological solution to the onslaughts on a country formerU.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger termed ``aninternational basket case.''   The call, repeated last week by Bangladesh's President HussainMuhammad Ershad, has gone largely unheeded.   ``Ten years ago there was a proposal for the Himalayanecosystem,'' said Erling Dessau, head of the United NationsDevelopment Program in Bangladesh. ``There wasn't much interest init.''</TEXT></DOC>
