Those are two major findings of a study by a group of 15 banks, securities houses and management consultants in London's financial district, known as the City. The report, based on responses from 500 companies representing nearly 80% of the City's 273,000 work force, is sharply critical of the way much of the British and international financial industry in the City has managed its rapid expansion and contraction in the past few years.    The City has &quot;gotten itself into a fair mess&quot; by failing to plan, train and develop employees, says Rhiannon Chapman, personnel director at London's stock exchange, a sponsor of the study. She said that during the bull market, the financial-services industry did most of its recruiting through the lures of dizzying salaries and fancy perks.    Now, with many financial markets lackluster, &quot;nobody can afford&quot; the short-term policies that bid up salaries and raised costs, she said.    The survey's major findings include:   --British securities-industry employment will fall to 25,000 by 1992 from 28,000 prior to last October's stock market crash. Already, 1,500 securities-industry jobs have been lost, and a further 1,500 cuts are expected because of sluggish markets.    --The rate of job creation in the City will fall to 3% annually through 1992 from a 7.5% rate in the recent past.    --Overall, the City could create 13.5%, or 37,000 new jobs, by 1992 if companies take steps to improve training and development. </TEXT></DOC>
