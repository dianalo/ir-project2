McKinney Homeless Assistance AmendmentsAct of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-628, approved November 7, 1988) (Amendments Act)made several changes to the Supportive Housing Demonstration Program. Asrequired by section 485 of the Amendments Act, HUD published a Notice onJanuary 9, 1989 (54 FR 736), for immediate effect, describing the changes,and invited public comments for consideration in amending the final rulewithin 12 months of enactment. This publication codifies the changes tothe Supportive Housing final rule, which was published on June 24, 1988(53 FR 23898) and codified at 24 CFR Parts 840 and 841. These changes tothe rule will be in effect only until HUD publishes the amended final rulewithin 12 months of enactment of the Amendments Act, as required by section485. The sole purpose of this rule is to codify the changes in the SupportiveHousing program required to be implemented by the Amendments Act, so thatparticipants in the program will not find it necessary to consult two separatedocuments (HUD's existing final rule published on June 24, 1988 and theNotice published January 9, 1989) in order to determine what regulatoryrequirements will govern Fiscal Year 1989 grants.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>March 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Morris Bourne, Department of Housingand Urban Development, Room 9140, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC20410, telephone (202) 755-1520.

Revised collection of information requirements were submittedto the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h)of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and were approved on under OMB controlnumber 2502-0361.

HUD will performthe environmental review for applications from private nonprofit organizations,governmental entities with special or limited purpose powers, and any governmentalentities with general purpose powers found not to have the legal capacityto carry out this responsibility. For the environmental review requirementsfor all other applicants, see andSection; 840.220.(ii) With regard to the environmental effects of applications for whichHUD performs the review, HUD will make the assessment in accordance withthe provisions of NEPA and the related authorities listed in 24 CFR 50.4.Any application subject to environmental review by HUD that requires anEnvironmental Impact Statement (EIS) (generally, an application that HUDdetermines would have a significant impact on the human environment, inaccordance with the environmental assessment procedures at 24 CFR Part50, Subpart E) will not pass threshold review and will not be eligiblefor assistance under this part.(iii) Applications for projects that are to be acquired, rehabilitated,or assisted with transitional housing funds and that are located in any100-year floodplain (or 500-year floodplain for critical actions, <T3>i.e.</T3>, projects intended to serve developmentally disabled, chronicallymentally ill, or mobility impaired residents), as designated by maps preparedby the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), are subject to the floodplainreview requirements of Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management (May24, 1977). The floodplain review will be a part of the environmental reviewdescribed in paragraphs (b)(7) (i) and (ii) of this section. Applicantsmay be required to provide engineering and structural information in orderfor HUD to undertake the floodplain review. If HUD is unable to make afloodplain determination within 60 days from the date it publishes thefirst notice required under the floodplain review, and the applicant hasnot provided the HUD-requested information in a timely manner, the applicationwill be rejected.(iv) <T3>Alternative considerations. </T3>Executive Order 11988 requires HUD(or the applicant where the applicant assumes environmental review responsibilitiesunder andSection; 840.220) to consider alternatives to avoid adverse impactsassociated with the occupancy and modification of floodplains. The alternativesmay include actions resulting in less risk to human life or property. Thereview process may result in specific mitigation requirements or rejectionof the site or application for assistance. As part of the eight-step process,HUD (or the applicant) must reevaluate alternatives to projects/sites locatedin floodplains and, where HUD performs the review, HUD will assign a higherenvironmental rating to applications with less hazardous sites.(v) As a result of the environmental review of those applications for whichHUD performs the review, HUD may find that it cannot approve an applicationunless adequate measures are taken to mitigate environmental impacts. (See<T3>e.g.</T3>, 24 CFR Part 51). If an application passes threshold review,HUD will consider the anticipated time delays in adopting appropriate impactmitigation measures in the ranking stage of the selection process. Theenvironmental review may also reveal other information not contained inthe application that may have relevance to the selection process. HUD willconsider such information in the selection process, but, in all cases inwhich HUD performs the review, the environmental review must be accomplishedbefore an application may be approved.14. Section 840.215 is amended by adding paragraphs (b) (6) and (7), toread as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 840.215</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Ranking criteria.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(b) * * *(6) <T3>Employment assistance program. </T3>HUD will consider the extent towhich the applicant has an employment assistance program.
