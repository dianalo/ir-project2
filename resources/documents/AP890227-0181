Buying South African Military Equipment</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Black African leaders on Monday attackedsuggestions that the U.N. peacekeeping force in Namibia may buy orlease military equipment from South Africa. Squabbles overpurchasing have delayed funding approval.   On April 1, U.N. peacekeepers plan to begin implementing aone-year plan for Namibia's independence from 74 years of SouthAfrican rule.   U.N. officials have said they need make purchases from SouthAfrica, which lies on Namibia's southern border, to keep down thecost of the mission that has a proposed budget of $416 million.   Ambassador Isack Stanislaus Gorerazvo Mudenge of Zimbabwe,representing the non-aligned movement, said Monday no need exists todepend on South Africa for military equipment. He said he acceptedthat South Africa dominates the economy of the region and saidpeacekeepers could buy anything except military equipment from thatwhite-dominated nation.   Zambian Ambassador Peter Dingiswayo Zuze, representing the blackAfrican front-line states, joined Mudenge at the news conference.   The front-line states border on South Africa or are particularlyconcerned with events there. They are Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana,Mozambique, Tanzania and Angola.   Mudenge said dependence on South Africa may be unavoidable in theearly stages, ``but we expect them (the U.N. officials) to plan soas to minimize that dependence.''   The General Assembly's finance committee has been deadlocked overthe procurement issue since last week.   The General Assembly has had to hold up approving the funding forthe Namibia force.   Front-line states insist on inserting language into the fundingresolution referring to U.N. embargoes on buying military equipment,oil or other goods from South Africa.   The United States, Britain and France oppose including suchlanguage.</TEXT></DOC>
