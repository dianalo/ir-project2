In a meeting with top policy advisers, Bush put new focus on the``Andean strategy'' to fight drugs in South American countries thatare the source of illicit narcotics, said national security adviserBrent Scowcroft. The adviser said, however, it was too early tocomment on Colombia's request for another $19 million, on top of the$65 million Bush already has approved.   Bush also declined to comment directly on the request, advancedin Washington by Colombian justice minister Monica de Greiff, andsaid details of the aid are ``being worked out now'' in discussionswith the Colombians.   The president made the comments to reporters after a strategyreview with top Cabinet advisers, including the attorney general andsecretary of defense, on a revamped anti-drug plan that he willannounce in a nationally broadcast White House address Sept. 5.   Scowcroft said after the meeting that Bush is adjusting hisstrategy to respond to the heightened drug crisis in Colombia. Druglords there have launched a series of attacks and threaten to killmore judges in retaliation for extradition of any drug traffickingsuspects.   He indicated that new focus would be put on the ``Andeanstrategy'' to provide aid to interdict cocaine in the sourcecountries of Peru, Colombia and Bolivia.   Vacationing at his seaside home on the Maine coast, Bush summonedhis Cabinet advisers involved in the international component of the$8 billion anti-drug strategy to be unveiled in a week.   Asked Mrs. de Greiff's request for $19 million in additional aid,Bush would not comment directly. But he said: ``We will cooperatewith Colombia to the best of our of our ability. I support what thepresident of that country has been trying to do. and everyone of ourcabinet officers here, all of us, agree that this is importantstep.''   He said he had ``great respect'' for Colombian President VirgilioBarco's call for foreign drug users to help curb demand for drugs.This demand, Barco said, is destroying his country.   Asked about reports that Bush's anti-drug strategy would include$300 million in economic and military aid for the Andean countries,Scowcroft told reporters that figure had already been adjustedupward by $65 million with the president's announcement ofadditional helicopters and equipment aid for Colombia last week.   He indicated there could be further adjustments in the figure,but gave no specifics.   In Washington, there were these related developments:   _At the Pentagon, a spokesman said that distribution of the $65million worth of U.S. military aid was awaiting a detailed list ofneeds from Colombian officials.   ``When the list is returned to the United States delivery willbegin,'' Pete Williams told reporters.   Williams said the United States sent Colombia a list of equipmentavailable for immediate transfer from Defense Department stocksafter Bush granted the aid. The Colombians, in turn, issued theirlist of requests.   Williams declined to say what type of equipment would beprovided, noting in general terms it would be aircraft, weapons,ammunition, personal gear, communications equipment and medicalsupplies.   _Mrs. de Greiff, holding a news conference at the ColombianEmbassy, vowed to stay on the job, saying ``the law is under siegein Colombia and we must protect it every way we can.''   ``I never considered resigning,'' she said in response to aquestion about such reports. ``The threats are out there, but I amsatisfied with my protection right now.''   In the session with reporters covering the vacationing presidentin Maine, Scowcroft noted that the primary focus of Bush's anti-drugstrategy will be on the domestic aspects, including law enforcementassistance, education and treatment programs.   Bush called the meeting at his Walker's Point home where he hasbeen vacationing since Aug. 16. Arriving from Washington, inaddition to Scowcroft, were Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Deputy Secretary of State LawrenceEagleburger, national drug policy coordinator William Bennett, WhiteHouse chief of staff John Sununu and CIA Director William Webster.   Scowcroft said de Greiff's request for more money was notdiscussed at the president's meeting because officials had justlearned of it in reports from Washington.   ``We're now in discussions with the Colombians over the $65million package. We put it together based on ... what we thoughtthat the Colombians would need in order to undertake the operatiosnthat they have in mind,'' he said. ``They're now discussing with usthe kind of things they think they need.''   Scowcroft said ``it's not clear to me'' what de Greiff's extra$19 million would be for. But he added that he was not ruling outthe possibility of more aid than the $65 million Bush is providingfrom an emergency assistance fund.   In addition, the administration has announced a $5 millionpackage of security assistance to help protect the Colombian judgeswho are a principle target of drug assassins.   On a related matter, Scowcroft said ``it's possible'' that somedrug traffickers wanted for extradition to the United States havetaken refuge in Panama, where a Sept. 1 deadline for installation ofa new government comes up this week.   There is no government to install, however, because the country'sde facto ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, invalidated last May'selections, after first allegdly rigging them to his advantage.   Scowcroft said the administration would ``have something to say''about the administraion's position position relative to Panama thisweek.   De Greiff indicated the $19 million she was seeking would be forbullet proof cars and other protective measures for the judicialofficials.   Scowcroft lauded the Colombian government for ``bravely standingup'' to the drug traffickers who are waging a war of violence andassassination on government officials.   ``We want to do everything we can to help the Colombians,'' hesaid.   He said Bush also would raise the drug issue with Canadian PrimeMinister Brian Mulroney, when Mulroney arrives Wednesday for atwo-day private visit with the president here. Scowcroft said Bushwill likely ask the Canadians to get involved in the anti-drugeffort in South America.   Bush already had approved the major planks of his new anti-drugstrategy. But a draft of his Sept. 5 television address beingcirculated in the administration contained blanks on some details,including what he will say on Colombia, one official said. Theaddress will be Bush's first televised speech to the nation from theWhite House.   Bush returns to Washington a day before, after nearly three weekson vacation here.</TEXT></DOC>
