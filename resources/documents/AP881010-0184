The union said the move will give strikers first crack at anyjobs vacated by non-union employees who now run the mills in Jay;De Pere, Wis.; and Lock Haven, Pa.   ``This stage of the war is over. We have lost this battle butthe war for justice in the work place is not over,'' said FelixJacques, executive vice president of United PaperworkersInternational Union Local 14 in Jay.   Local union presidents from the three mills reached theirdecision Sunday after a weekend of private meetings at unionheadquarters in Nashville, Tenn., union officials said. The companywas informed by telegram Sunday.   The workers, including 1,200 at the Jay plant, went on strikeJune 16, 1987, when the union rejected a concessionary contract.The company imposed the contract and kept the plants open withreplacement workers.   About 720 union members went on strike at the Pennsylvaniaplant, and 350 were on strike in Wisconsin.   A mill spokesman at the Jay plant said the union members, bycalling off the strike, gained the right to be given firstpreference for any openings. But he said the mill was ``at fullcomplement'' and hires new employees at an average rate of onlythree per week.   ``As openings occur, we will welcome workers who have been onstrike who qualify for those openings,'' said Richard White,stressing that none of the replacement workers would be asked toleave.   During the strike, this central Maine town of 4,000 has been thescene of boisterous rallies and marches, as well as occasionalviolence and vandalism that led to court orders limiting activitieson the picket line. A series of chemical leaks and on-the-jobaccidents at the mill heightened tensions in recent months, withthe union blaming the problems on the inexperience of the newworkers.   The union's decision to end the strike does not affect thecompany's Mobile, Ala., mill, where more than 1,000 union membershave been locked out. The union had sought to consolidate the labordisputes at the four mills, but with little success.   International Paper, one of the largest paper companies in theworld, has said that the strike has had little effect on production.   Jacques said the union's national leadership had left the localpresidents no choice. He said it was clear the national union couldnot provide the support needed to continue the strike much longer.Strikers had been receiving $55 a week in strike benefits.   Some of the strikers in Jay, many of whom earned more than$35,000 a year at the plant, took other jobs during the prolongedstrike.   Jacques announced the end of the strike to reporters and about80 somber union members at the union hall, where a sign out frontread ``Stand Tall. We Will All Go Back Together.''   Although the union has taken no position on whether membersshould return to the mill, he said, ``We will stand here in totalsupport of anyone who ... goes into that mill.''   Said striker Roland Samson, ``It's not that we don't want tofight _ it's just that we can't. We have nothing to fight with.''   Maine Gov. John R. McKernan, whose vetoes of legislationsupported by organized labor made him a lightning rod for thestrikers' anger, called the Jay situation ``a tragedy.'' Hereiterated his view that the strikers were pawns in a fight betweenan international company and an international union.   ``I believe this would have been resolved'' if the dispute hadremained at the local level, McKernan said. ``We just weren'tcalling our (own) shots, either at the management level or theunion level.''   An election to decertify the paperworkers union as thebargaining agent for mill employees has already been held in DePere, and the results are under challenges by both the union andmanagement. Similar elections are anticipated at the other twomills. The strikers automatically lose the right to vote in suchelections after one year on the picket line.</TEXT></DOC>
