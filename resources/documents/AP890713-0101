Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said regular legislation was the bestway ``swiftly and simply'' to overcome the Supreme Court ruling lastmonth that protected flag burning as a form of free speech.   ``No matter how we cut it, a constitutional amendment is going totake some time'' and leave a gap in the law during which flagburning would remain legal, Biden said. A bill could take effectalmost immediately, and if it still didn't meet constitutionalmuster, then an amendment could be pursued, he said.   ``Let's heal the wound, pass the legislation and move on,'' urgedBiden.   Biden's testimony came as the House subcommittee onconstitutional law opened a series of hearings on what to do aboutthe Supreme Court ruling.   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., testified in favor ofthe constitutional amendment supported by President Bush.   ``We believe there is no quick legislative fix on this issue,''said Michel, who was joined by Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss.,chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee.   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said he opposed a constitutionalamendment on flag burning, although he conceded most peopledisagreed with him.   ``It is that very freedom, the right to protest even when it isoffensive, that makes us different from the rest of the world,'' hesaid, comparing the United States with the current repressionagainst protesters in China.   Legislative efforts short of an amendment might be impossible, hesaid.   ``I'm not certain it is possible to draft a constitutionallysolid statute,'' he said.   Subcommittee chairman Don Edwards, D-Calif., urged his colleaguesto be cautious.   ``The flag is sturdy, flying proudly through every fierce battleof every war and through times of social upheaval,'' he said. ``TheConstitution, however, is fragile and can be amended by the votes oflegislators caught up in the emotional whirlwinds of the moment.''   Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the ranking Republican onthe subcommittee, said he believed the constitutional amendmentshould be quickly passed and sent to the states for ratificationbecause of the uncertainty that a statute would hold.   ``If we want to heal the wounds'' of the Supreme Court decision,``we ought to make sure the patient doesn't have a relapse,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
