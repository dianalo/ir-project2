Experts at the two-day forum on technology and its role in thefinancial markets are exploring how to give the marketscomputer-driven efficiency without courting computer-driven disaster.   As exchanges move toward 24-hour, worldwide trading and installever-faster computers, the experts want to make sure electronictrading systems do not overwhelm the people who are supposed tocontrol them.   One concern is the wild price swings that have occurredperiodically in the stock market, partly due to computerized tradingprograms that can rapidly buy or sell millions of shares as part ofspeculative strategies.   Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard University economist, said harmfulspeculation could be reduced by a tax on securities trades.   But Louis I. Margolis, a managing director of the Wall Streetinvestment firm Salomon Brothers Inc., said a better answer would bea return to fixed commissions for brokers.   The proposals came on the second and main day of the forum, whichwas sponsored by the Annenberg Washington Program and NorthwesternUniversity's Kellogg Graduate School of Management.   Acknowledging that investors are unlikely to tolerate going backto fixed brokerage fees, Salomon's Margolis said an alternativewould be to free brokerage firms from some of their remainingconstraints.   Brokerage firms are hamstrung today, unable to stabilize themarkets by coming in to buy stocks when prices fall steeply,Margolis said.   ``We are coming along to a liquidity crisis in the stockmarket,'' Margolis said.   ``We've seen the traditional swings between optimism andpessimism compressed into very short periods of time,'' he said.   But Summers said the best way to deal with the chaotic priceswings would be to discourage short-term trading.   The forum featured sessions with federal regulators, academicsand leaders of several major exchanges.   Among the observers are representatives of the congressionalOffice of Technology Assessment, which is in the middle of its own18-month study of technology's impact on the financial markets.   ``This one sounds very much like a condensed version of our ownstudy,'' Vary Coates, who is directing the congressional study, saidMonday.   Technology was partly blamed for the Oct. 19, 1987, stock marketcrash. Several investigators said the disaster was worsened byportfolio insurance, a computerized strategy of selling securitiesinto a declining market.   Some also blamed wild price gyrations during the crash on indexarbitrage, a computerized trading strategy for profiting on pricegaps between stocks traded in New York and the underlyingstock-index futures traded in Chicago.   More recently, though, technology has been put forward as asolution to the alleged abuses in the Chicago trading pits, wherefutures and options are traded by chaotic ``open outcry.''   Using computers to match buyers and sellers in Chicago wouldbreak the hold of floor traders who are accused of excludingoutsiders and making private deals that disadvantage customers,advocates of computerization say.   The problem for reformers is that computerization can challengesome politically powerful interests: in Chicago, the floor traders,and in New York, the specialists who make a market in particularstocks.   The 1987 stock market crash convinced the exchanges that theyneeded to do a better job of computerizing the unglamorous butessential back offices, where questioned trades are settled andcleared _ meaning the money and securities change hands.   ``Everyone has concentrated on front-end systems; that is, theexecution side of it. They have not concentrated that closely on therisk-management side,'' said John Wall, an executive vice presidentat the National Association of Securities Dealers.   In the 1987 crash, turmoil in the back offices was so great thatmajor banks were unwilling to make emergency loans to securitiesfirms because they weren't confident that adequate collateralexisted for the loans. The crisis ended when the Federal Reserveinjected massive reserves into the system and strong-armed the banks.   ``Maybe people, at least in the financial sector, may have gonetoo far and allowed too much automation without checks andbalances,'' said Paul F. Glaser, chairman of the CorporateTechnology Committee of Citicorp.   Nevertheless, Glaser said he continues to believe that technologycan reduce risk in the financial markets. ``First of all, you can'tgo back,'' he said. ``You've got to deal with it.''</TEXT></DOC>
