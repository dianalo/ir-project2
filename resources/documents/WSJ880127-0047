Kelly, whose E-II Holdings Inc. is locked in a takeover battle with American Brands Inc., has run into problems selling his other crown jewel, Beatrice Cos.    When Beatrice was put on the block last September, the expected profit to Mr. Kelly and other holders was estimated at a staggering $3.8 billion. Beatrice had been taken private in a $6.2 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986.    But now, Beatrice's investment banker, First Boston Corp., is recommending that the Chicago-based foods giant be sold in pieces, something that Mr. Kelly had hoped to avoid, sources close to Beatrice say. Major Beatrice units produce Hunt's tomato products, Wesson oils, Swift meats and Tropicana juices.    After a five-month auction run by First Boston, Wall Street sources say only an undisclosed bid emerged -- and that's likely to be rejected as inadequate by Mr. Kelly and by other Beatrice holders, chiefly Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., the leveraged buy-out firm that hired Mr. Kelly to run Beatrice.    Beatrice has been shopped to more than 50 U.S. and foreign concerns, including several major food companies. But Wall Street sources say few were interested in buying the entire company, a big bite for even the largest concerns. Many, however, were said to have expressed willingness to buy pieces of Beatrice.    Another snag is a host of miscellaneous liabilities totaling about $1.1 billion on Beatrice's balance sheet that might prove troublesome to shed even if the company is sold piecemeal. First Boston is currently studying ways to parcel out the liabilities along with any businesses that are sold. The less attractive alternative, Wall Street sources say, is for Beatrice to swallow the entire $1.1 billion liability.    Mr. Kelly and Kohlberg Kravis are expected to reach a decision on the matter Monday. A spokesman for Kohlberg Kravis declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Beatrice.    Problems with the Beatrice sale come at a bad time for Mr. Kelly, the 65-year-old deal maker who is chairman of both E-II and Beatrice. After his investment in Old Greenwich, Conn.-based American Brands was disclosed last fall, he proposed a proxy fight against the diversified tobacco concern to put six new directors on its board.    But American Brands surprised Mr. Kelly last week with a hostile offer for his own company, Chicago-based E-II. Mr. Kelly's response to the offer is expected later this week. At the same time, E-II disclosed that it sustained $147.5 million stock market losses in the October crash.    The Beatrice sale has been rumored to be in trouble for months. In December, Wall Street sources, citing the stock market's precipitous decline, said First Boston was expecting a drastically reduced sale price for Beatrice, perhaps between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. That would represent a drop of $1 billion or more in the expected price -- and in the Kelly group's profits. Kohlberg Kravis and other investors count themselves roughly even on the Beatrice transaction to date.    The sole bid received for the company is said to have come from a U.S. concern. Wall Street sources didn't identify the company, except to say that it also wants to sell off parts of Beatrice.    Selling Beatrice piecemeal would still give Mr. Kelly and Kohlberg Kravis a mammoth profit, perhaps more than $3 billion, given Mr. Kelly's surprising ability to negotiate top-dollar prices for Beatrice assets already sold.    But a big hurdle to breaking up the company remains the $1.1 billion in liabilities, which are said to relate to pension funds and other corporate liabilities built up over the years. &quot;It's a big number,&quot; said an individual involved in the sale.    Sources close to E-II and Beatrice deny that delay of the sale will affect the American Brands fight. They say that Mr. Kelly doesn't need funds from Beatrice's sale to launch a bid for American Brands. </TEXT></DOC>
