Education Department officials said the proposal will be included in the fiscal 1988 budget request for the Chapter 1 program, which provides funding for remedial education. The request would boost Chapter 1's budget for the year beginning Oct. 1 to $4.1 billion from $3.9 billion and increase the number of students served to 5.5 million from five million. Some schools, however, could lose Chapter 1 funding under the proposal.    William Kristol, Education Secretary William Bennett's chief of staff, said in an interview that vouchers -- dubbed &quot;compensatory education certificates&quot; -- are part of an effort to enhance the accountability of the remedial education program. Under administration proposals to reauthorize Chapter 1, the states must assess the effectiveness of the local programs and make those reports public.    In effect, the plan would allow state authorities to take over ineffective local programs and issue the vouchers.    One response to an ineffective program would be for local districts to give parents vouchers that could be used to pay for remedial education provided by other educational institutions, including private ones.    In November 1985, the department proposed that local school districts be required to offer vouchers to parents of students needing remedial education. Those vouchers could have been used to purchase educational services, not necessarily remedial education, at public or private schools.    &quot;There wasn't much support on (Capitol) Hill for that proposal,&quot; Mr. Kristol said.    The earlier plan was opposed by many in Congress and by educational organizations, who said it would weaken public school systems. The latest proposal is designed to lessen such opposition in that the vouchers wouldn't be mandatory.    The new plan gives local districts a &quot;huge amount of flexibility&quot; in deciding whether to use vouchers and how to structure such a program, he said. The plan would require that special education funds be used for remedial education and be targeted at schools with large numbers of poor and educationally disadvantaged children, so that &quot;funds go to schools that really need them the most,&quot; Mr. Kristol said.    That would strip some schools of Chapter 1 funds, he acknowleged, including those that may have affluent students with learning difficulties. Currently, about 90% of the nation's school districts receive Chapter 1 funding.    Vouchers aren't permitted in the current Chapter 1 program. Under the new proposal, parents wouldn't have the right to demand vouchers; the decision to offer vouchers would be left to state or local school officials.    Mr. Kristol said the voucher proposal could help provide remedial services for parochial students. A Supreme Court decision prohibits public school teachers from teaching in religious schools, but the law says Chapter 1 services must be available to parochial students. The voucher plan would let those students secure remedial education outside their religious schools. </TEXT></DOC>
