But the two superpowers also share an inability to advance their interests in Tehran.    President Reagan cited possible Russian inroads in Iran as one justification for the risky arms transfers he authorized, but many analysts argue that the Soviet Union hasn't much hope of gaining either political or military influence with its southern neighbor.    Some even contend that the Soviets have lost ground in Tehran in recent years. &quot;In the first several years of the revolution, they operated openly,&quot; says Christine Helms, a Washington-based Mideast expert. &quot;Now they can't afford to stick their heads up above the rooftops because they'll get shot off.&quot;    She says the radically Islamic Khomeini regime has &quot;emasculated&quot; the Iranian communist party by arresting, imprisoning or executing most of its leaders. The Soviets, she says, are having as much difficulty searching out Iranian communists as the U.S. is having locating Iranian moderates to work with.    The seven-year Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, which also borders Iran, stiffens Iranian resistance to Russian inroads. Iran has increased its support of the anti-Soviet &quot;mujahideen&quot; in Afghanistan, and as more Afghan rebels and refugees pour into Iran, more stories circulate about Russian brutality toward Moslems.    The prospect of a Soviet invasion of Iran seems remote, says Joshua Epstein of the Brookings Institution. &quot;There's a rotten transportation infrastructure and a terrible terrain,&quot; he contends. Mountain ranges and gorges would make it difficult for Soviet troops to reach the oil fields and warm water ports in the south that have always made Iran strategically attractive to Moscow. Soviet military literature notes that reaching Mashhad in northeast Iran would entail passage through the Dash Arasy gorge, an easy choke-point vulnerable to air attack.    In &quot;Strategy andamp; Force Planning,&quot; a recently published book that examines the Soviet threat to Iran's oil fields, Mr. Epstein emphasizes that the shortage of highways and railroads would make any invasion from the north arduous and slow. Moreover, U.S. F-111s, which the U.S. used in April's Libyan bombing raid, could be flown in from U.S. airbases in Turkey to close off the arteries that do exist. In addition, the U.S. Central Command, which controls rapid deployment forces, could call on nearly seven Army and Marine divisions, along with 10 tactical air wings, two bomber squadrons, three carrier battle groups and 3,500 special warfare troops.    Although the Soviets maintain 24 divisions near Iran, the Russian units are &quot;in a low state of readiness,&quot; Mr. Epstein says. He figures that Moscow would need at least a month to move vehicles, troops, and command and control facilities to Iran's northern border. Then there would be a messy trek southward. By this time, the U.S. could set up a reliable defense of Iranian oil facilities in the Khuzestan area in the south.    &quot;If the Soviets seek to impose their will on the Iranians, they will fail miserably,&quot; says a Republican Senate aide. Afghanistan -- geographically less forbidding to invade -- has caused the Russians far more problems than they bargained for, he says. He thinks the administration has exaggerated the likelihood of such a move in trying to defend the sale of arms to Iran.    But Defense Department officials say it would be folly to dismiss the possibility of Soviet aggression in Iran, particularly if the country lapses into Lebanon-like chaos after the death of Khomeini. The U.S. estimates there are about 600 Russian agents in Iran, and that Soviet officials have garnered support among breakaway Kurdish tribesmen in the north. A Soviet delegation visited Tehran this month in a push to improve relations.    And although he argued against the U.S. arms shipments, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger has few doubts that the Soviet Union has designs on Iran. &quot;The long-range strategic plan of the Soviets includes gaining complete access to the oil fields,&quot; he says. &quot;One of the routes is through Iran. One route is through Afghanistan -- that's why the Soviets are in there. One way or the other they want to get to the oil fields, and they've never lost their need for warm water ports.&quot;    According to the Pentagon, prospects for a Soviet-Iranian rapprochement peaked in April 1985 when Iran's deputy foreign minister visited Moscow. But the initiative withered because, in Moscow's view, the Khomeini regime was demanding an end to Russian aid to Iraq without offering much in return. </TEXT></DOC>
