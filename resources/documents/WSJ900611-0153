The post of deputy attorney general, traditionally theday-to-day operations chief of the 75,000-person department,now includes an additional task that is even more daunting.He must help repair the damaged political reputation of hisboss, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, the most beleagueredmember of the Bush cabinet.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Barr, an affable Reaganite conservative with strongties to the Bush White House as well, has taken some sensiblepreliminary steps. For starters, he reveals a sense of humorand humility about a department that bucked and stalled whilea coterie of longtime Thornburgh vassals were at the wheel.   &quot;His personal staff was playing, by default, too much ofan operating role,&quot; acknowledges Mr. Barr, whose promotionfrom assistant attorney general is expected to receive quickSenate confirmation. Already moved into the deputy's spaciousfourth-floor office suite, the somewhat rumpled lawyer inhorn-rimmed glasses explains that he has taken the unusualstep of drafting three veteran U.S. attorneys as specialassistants. They will help him pick his way through abureaucratic briar patch that he admits he doesn't know muchabout yet. The message to disgruntled department employees isclear: We're going back to the drawing board, with respectedprosecutors from the field on the way to whip things intoshape.   Mr. Barr, a former Central Intelligence Agency legislativeaide zealous about protecting executive branch prerogatives,nevertheless promises &quot;a more open department,&quot; with greateraccess afforded to inquisitive lawmakers and reporters. Hewon't comment on the matter directly, but he is said tobelieve that the attorney general made a mistake by turning ano-leaks policy into a holy crusade.   Investigators collared no culprits, but Mr. Thornburghraised suspicions by locking out the department'sinternal-affairs office. To make matters worse, the attorneygeneral kept quiet when two aides, since pushed aside,registered some deception during lie-detector tests.   Despite Mr. Barr's promises of reform, there are reasonsto be skeptical that he will bring lasting changes. Here arethree areas to watch:                                                                                                          Public image. Mr. Thornburgh has been badly tarnished byhis bedraggled inquiry into a leak about a federalinvestigation involving Rep. William Gray (D., Pa.). Afterexonerating Mr. Gray a year ago, the attorney general nowrefuses to reiterate that the No. 3 House Democrat isn't thetarget of a grand jury inquiry in Philadelphia. Thatobfuscation, combined with the issuance of subpoenas toorganizations that have paid Mr. Gray speaking fees, createsthe impression, once again, of partisan gamesmanship.   Mr. Barr could help clear the air by urging the attorneygeneral to acknowledge that this is an exceptional case andto state what, if anything, federal investigators still wantto know about Mr. Gray. But there is little reason to hopethis will happen. Asked about the Gray situation, Mr. Barrsays, &quot;I don't know anything about any investigation, nor doI want to.&quot; He declines to comment further.                                                                                                          Congressional relations. After successfully helpingnegotiate anti-drug legislation in late 1988, the Thornburghregime has taken an adversarial stance toward Congress,compared by Democratic Capitol Hill staff members to that ofReagan administration Attorney General Edwin Meese. Lately,there have been positive developments, such as Mr.Thornburgh's agreement to cooperate with a House JudiciaryCommittee investigation of a longfestering computer softwareprocurement scandal at the department.   But one way Mr. Barr impressed the attorney general,according to some observers, was by refusing to cooperatewith congressional efforts to look into legal opinions thatexpanded the authority of U.S. agents and troops to do policework abroad. Moreover, in most cases the department hasn'tplayed a significant role in shaping legislation viewed asimportant by the White House. The department isn't deeplyinvolved, for example, in the negotiations over the biganti-crime bill under debate in the Senate.                                                                                                          Running trains on time. Dick Thornburgh enjoys beingcalled governor. He cites his eight years as chief executiveof Pennsylvania as a case study of frugal, commonsensemanagement.   At the Justice Department, he has identified waste andinefficiency in a number of areas, including the Immigrationand Naturalization Service and the Marshals Service. Newdirectors are in place, and some bureaucratic flow chartshave been rearranged. But substantive change has been slow,if evident at all. Drug enforcement officials, for example,worry that regional marshals who act as custodians offorfeited assets frequently allow them to depreciate becauseof a lack of financial acumen.   Meanwhile, other problems continue unchecked. In thedepartment's money-granting and research arm, the Office ofJustice Programs, career employees say that federal moneyintended to fertilize innovative state and local programs isbeing channeled elsewhere. A House Government Operationssubcommittee investigation disclosed that almost half of one$50 million grant program for states and cities actuallystayed in Washington, most of it at the Justice Department.   Mr. Barr says his mission will be &quot;coordinating thedepartment's efforts {which have been} lacking in a number ofareas.&quot; As to specifics, he understandably pleads ignorance,having just unpacked his boxes and hung his photographs. Butif Mr. Thornburgh is to resuscitate his reputation as a savvymanager, it will be Mr. Barr who wades into more than a fewmesses and begins the cleanup.</TEXT></DOC>
