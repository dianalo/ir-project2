(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New York's highest court ruled Thursday thata partner in a long-term homosexual relationship can take over thecouple's rent-controlled apartment when the lover who signed thelease dies.   In a 4-2 ruling, the Court of Appeals ordered a lower court toreconsider its decision permitting the eviction of a New York Cityman from a rent-controlled apartment he shared for a decade with hislover, who died.   In doing so, the court expanded the definition of a ``family'' asit applies to New York's rent-control laws. The word is crucialbecause state law says only ``family members'' may continue to livein rent-controlled apartments, saving hundreds of dollars a month inrent in many cases, when the tenant whose name is on the lease dies.   The rent-control laws date from the housing crunch of World WarII. They limit the rent increases landlords can charge in apartmentswith longterm tenants.   The court said the definition of ``family members'' shouldinclude adults who show long-term financial and emotional commitmentto each other, even if they don't fit the traditional meaning of afamily.   The New York decision is the first time any top state court inthe nation has recognized a gay couple to be the legal equivalent ofa family, according to American Civil Liberties Union lawyer WilliamRubenstein.   ``Today's decision is a ground-breaking victory for lesbians andgay men,'' Rubenstein said Thursday. ``It marks the most importantsingle step forward in American law toward legal recognition oflesbian and gay relationships.''   Also this week, a law was scheduled to take effect in SanFrancisco permitting unmarried couples to register as ``domesticpartners,'' giving them certain rights such as the right tobereavement leave from a city job if the partner dies.   The law, passed last month, is strongly supported by gay-rightsgroups, but some clergymen waged a petition campaign seeking torepeal the measure and put it on the November ballot. On Thursday,the day the law was scheduled to take effect, the law was suspendedpending certification of signatures to put the repeal measure on theNovember ballot. Verification of the signatures, which weresubmitted Wednesday, was expected to take several days.   In the New York case, Judge Vito Titone wrote, ``We conclude thatthe term family ... should not be rigidly restricted to those peoplewho have formalized their relationship by obtaining, for instance, amarriage certificate.''   The case involves Miguel Braschi, 33, who wants to live in thedesirable Manhattan apartment he shared for 11 years with LeslieBlanchard. The two men were considered a lifetime couple and spousesby their friends.   Blanchard, the owner of a Manhattan beauty salon, died inBraschi's arms in September 1986, leaving Braschi almost $5 million.   Soon afterward, the landlord, Stahl Associates, attempted toevict Braschi on grounds that he had no right to continue living inthe below-price apartment because he wasn't related to Blanchard by``blood, marriage or adoption.''   Braschi's lawyers said the rent on the apartment is about $700,several hundred dollars per month less than it would cost on theopen market. But they argued that he and Blanchard were a family andso he had rights under the rent-control law.   A trial court said Braschi should be allowed to keep theapartment at the rent-control price but the Appellate Division ofstate Supreme Court, a first-level appeals court, reversed that andsaid Braschi had to leave.   In Thursday's ruling, the Court of Appeals said the AppellateDivision had failed to consider all the factors that should beconsidered when determining whether a person is a family member.   It ordered the appellate judges to consider Braschi's case again,considering such factors as the fidelity and longevity of therelationship, the level of emotional and financial commitment andthe way the participants presented themselves to society, Titonesaid.   David Picon, an attorney for Stahl Associates, said he would haveno comment on the decision.   Rubenstein and other lawyers for activist groups said the rulingwould also apply to unmarried heterosexual partners and poorfamilies who can't afford legal fees to adopt children or obtain adivorce.   ``This court is stating ... that gay couples, lesbian couples aswell as other couples that don't fit the Ozzie and Harriet moldshould be recognized as the families they are in reality,'' saidEvan Wolfson, a lawyer at the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, a nationalgay rights group.   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Richard Simons said the court wastoo broadly interpreting the state Legislature's intent in drafingNew York's rent control law. The court majority's decision, he said,``produces an unworkable test that is subject to abuse.''</TEXT></DOC>
