Friends appealed to the government for greater efforts to freeMcCarthy, and they released eight white doves outside the ForeignOffice.   ``The doves are symbolic of peace. We are releasing them as agesture of freedom in the hope of galvanizing the Foreign Office todo more,'' said McCarthy's girlfriend, Jill Morrell.   McCarthy's friends and relatives also placed a largeadvertisement in a Beirut newspaper appealing for his release.   McCarthy, who works for Worldwide Television News, disappearedafter being seized on the road to Beirut airport on his way homeApril 17, 1986.   He is one of four Britons missing in Lebanon. A total of 18Westerners, including eight Americans, are held there, most bypro-Iranian groups.   ``John has obviously suffered 3{ years of torture,'' MissMorrell said. ``I know he will have found some way of coping withit because John has a strong character, but I can't imagine how hekeeps sane. I don't think I could have done that.''   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was seized March 16,1985.</TEXT></DOC>
