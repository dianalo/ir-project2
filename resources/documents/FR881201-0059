TennesseeGas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) would construct a total of 35.7 milesof 10-, 12-, and 30-inch-diameter pipeline loop, 17.4 miles of 10-, 12-,and 24-inch-diameter replacement pipeline, and two new meter stations inNew York, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Also, 16 existing meter stationswould be upgraded and 2,075 horsepower of compression would be added at2 existing compressor stations. CNG Transmission Corporation (CNG) wouldconstruct 12.3 miles of 30-inch-diameter pipeline loop and a new measuringstation in New York. The facilities would be used to transport up to 24,418,257Dth of natural gas per year from Tennessee's Canadian and domestic supplies.Tennessee would deliver the gas to CNG near North Sheldon, New York, andCNG would redeliver it to Tennessee near Morrisville, New York. Tennesseewould then transport the gas to Northeast markets. In the Commission's <T3>Order Finding Additional Projects To Be Discrete And Dismissing Applications</T3>,issued on June 29, 1988, concerning pipeline projects in the Northeast,this project was determined to be ``discrete'' and was referred to as theNorex Project.\1\<NOTE/> Since the facilities proposed by Tennessee and CNG are interdependentand, if authorized, would be constructed simultaneously, the staff of theFERC will analyze them in one EA. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ A discrete project is one that can be processed independentlyand, if authorized, would not adversely affect the pending competitiveprojects to supply gas to the Northeast. The applications filed by CNG and Tennessee on October 6, 1987, and November2, 1988, respectively, seek a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessityunder section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act to increase firm transportationservice to 10 of Tennessee's existing customers. Tennessee, CNG, and thecustomers (referred to as the Norex Customers) \2\<NOTE/> state that the proposed service is needed by November 1,1989, to avoid curtailing service during the winter heating season or usingmore costly supplemental fuels. To meet the in-service date, constructionof the facilities is proposed to begin May 1, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The Berkshire Gas Company, Boston Gas Company, ColonialGas Company, Concord Natural Gas Corporation, EnergyNorth, Inc., EssexCounty Gas Company, Fithchburg Gas and Electric Light Company, City ofHolyoke, The Southern Connecticut Gas Company, and the Valley Gas Company.By this notice the FERC staff is requesting comments on the scope of theanalysis that should be conducted for the EA. All comments will be reviewedprior to publication of the EA and significant issues will be addressed.Comments should focus on potential environmental effects, alternativesto the proposal (including alternative routes), and measures to mitigateimpact. Written comments should be submitted by December 23, 1988, in accordancewith the procedures identified at the end of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Facilities </ITAG>Figures 1 and 2 show the general location of the facilities.

EnergyNorth,Inc., plans to construct 3.5 miles of 8-inch-diameter pipeline in the townof Londonderry, New Hampshire, to serve commercial and industrial customers.The pipeline would originate from Tennessee's Concord Lateral and parallelstate and local roads for its entire length, crossing mostly residentialland. The route is shown on map 27. It is unknown at this time whetherEnergyNorth, Inc., would construct the pipeline within the existing roadright-of-way (ROW) or seek new ROW from adjacent property owners. Also,Berkshire Gas Company plans to build 2.5 miles of 8-inch-diameter pipelinenear Northampton, Massachusetts, to enable it to receive Norex gas. Thepipeline would cross state land for a few tenths of a mile and would thenbe parallel and within railroad and highway ROW's for the remainder ofthe route. The area is predominantly residential and commercial. The routeis shown on map 30. <ITAG tagnum="84">Construction Techniques</ITAG>Constructing the proposed interstate pipeline would involve clearing andgrading the construction ROW, excavating a trench of sufficient depth toallow 18 to 36 inches of cover over the line, welding and laying the pipeline,backfilling the trench, and regarding and seeding the ROW. In a numberof locations blasting would be required to excavate the trench. Blast rockwould be disposed of on-site, if approved by the landowner, or in locallandfills. For the projects indicated in table 1 as pipeline replacements,the existing pipeline would be removed and the new line would be installedin or near the same ditch. For the pipeline loops, the new line would beinstalled parallel to the existing line and the permanent ROW would bewidened by 10 to 25 feet. After construction, the construction ROW wouldrevert in full to the landowner. Any new permanent ROW would be restrictedfrom development for the life of the facility. All disturbed areas wouldbe cleaned up, graded to conform to the original contours, and revegetatedin accordance with the landowner's specifications or a revegetation plan.<ITAG tagnum="84">Areas of Special Concern</ITAG>Tennessee's pipeline would cross about 2 miles of wetland. Also, a numberof creeks and rivers would be crossed, including the watersheds for Manchester,New Hampshire (Tennessee's section 9) and Ithaca, New York (Consolidated'sloop). High quality streams would be crossed during low-flow and non-spawningperiods. Clean rock tramways or portable bridges would be used to reduceturbidity where equipment crosses streams. Some rivers, including the Housatonicand Nashua Rivers in Massachusetts, may contain sediments contaminatedby polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's), a toxic substance, within the areato be trenched. Directional drilling is proposed for the Housatonic Rivercrossing to avoid disturbing contaminated sediments. A sediment analysesis proposed for the Nashua River to determine the content of PCB's. Allstream, river, and wetland crossings would be subject to the Commission'senvironmental review process, state permit requirements, and the U.S. ArmyCorps of Engineers sections 404 and 10 permits.  Tennessee's proposed Section 3 pipeline near Agawam, Massachusetts, wouldcross Leonard Pond, a wetland that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyhas identified as being sensitive to disturbance. Section 6, near Pittsfield,Massachusetts, would cross Brattle Brook Park, a wetland that is habitatfor a state-listed rare plant, and the Twin Meadows Wildlife Sanctuary,which is operated by the Massachusetts Audobon Society. Section 10 wouldcross the Middlesex Canal, which is on the National Register of HistoricPlaces, and a historic homestead known as Butter's Farm, which was builtin the late 1600's. Tennessee's pipeline traverses a number of residential areas in Massachusetts.Tennessee has proposed route alternatives to avoid a subdivision on theeast side of Holmes Road in Pittsfield, a subdivision on the east sideof County Road North in Easthampton, and a residential area east of RussellStreet in Peabody. According to Tennessee, there are no reasonable alternativesto avoid White Fox Estates in Agawam, a residential area between Elm andWilliams Streets in Pittsfield, a subdivision between West and Oliver Streetsin Easthampton, and a residential area between Lowell and Russell Streetsin Peabody. For these areas, Tennessee proposes special construction techniquesto minimize the work area and reduce the time of disturbance to any onelocation. All driveways, lawns, shrubs, fences, and other landscaping wouldbe restored. Tennessee's facilities are potentially contaminated by PCB's used in thepast for lubricating fluids. Tennessee must file a plan for abandonmentand disposal of the facilities with the FERC and the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, and the plan must be approved prior to construction.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Issues</ITAG>The EA will address a number of environmental concerns that have been raisedin previous projects in the region, and specific concerns identified bythe staff and various state and Federal agencies.
