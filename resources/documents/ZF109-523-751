Dvorak believes that VDTs are merely a convenient culprit for theclusters of miscarriages, birth defects and cataracts (&quot;Hey VDT Alarmists:Back Off Some,&quot; August, page 15).andP;  But reality differs from his portrayal.andM;Physicians at Kaiser-Permanente, an HMO in California, have observed anddocumented an association between women's pregnancy outcomes and theirhistory of VDT use during pregnancy.andM;And two independent studies of two different sets of children who lived closeto power lines in the Denver area showed that they had a higher than normalincidence of cancer.andM;MARJORIE LUNDQUISTandM;INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE INSTITUTEandM;MILWAUKEEandM;Just the facts, please.andP;  As for John Dvorak's column, it seems incredible tome that a writer could mention journalism, education and the scientificmethod in a column that doesn't offer a single piece of evidence to supporthis point.andM;DONALD T. NEWLANDSandM;PORTLAND, OREGONandM;As Paul Brodeur points out in the New Yorker article that Dvorak ridicules,the VDT manufacturers could solve the problem of electromagnetic radiationsimply and cheaply by directing the emanations upward instead of toward theuser.andM;MARK BRANDandM;TEMPE, ARIZONAandM;The controversial Kaiser study doesn't link electromagnetism withmiscarriages as far as I know.andP;  In fact, nobody has established a causalrelationship.andP;  Socioeconomic factors, rather than electromagnetism, mayaccount for the health problems of people who live near power lines.andP;  In theMiddle Ages, &quot;authorities &quot; assumed that people got the Black Plague frombreathing bad air--much like today's c tics assume that VDTs arehazardous.--John C. DvorakandM;Smell the Coffee, IBMandM;I can't believe it! Big Blue is trying to resuscitate the PCjr in the guiseof the PS/1 (&quot;Guess Who's Coming Home,&quot; August, page 104).andP;  it seems to meIBM would have learned its lesson in trying to market an unexpandable,underpowered, overpriced computer to the home market.andP;  My advice to IBM: Wakeup and smell the coffee !andP;  KEN SIMMONSandM;AUBURN, WASHINGTONandM;I had been singing PC/Computing's praises for months until you ran thatdisgusting photograph of a woman in an apron, accompanying &quot;Guess Who'sComing Home.&quot; Where do you get off portraying women that way? Sheesh.andP;  Willit never end? A big raspberry to you!andP;  TERRIE LAVERNE BURRELLandM;CHICAGOandM;You should have been here w en the  female) executive editor, the female)managing editor, the  female) features editor and t e rest of our femalesenior staff saw that photograph.andP;  I'm sure my wounds will heal--eventually.andM;Seriously, though, the picture was intended to depict the home market as seenby IBM, not us.andP;  While men outnumber women among our readership, the numberof women readers grows steadily.andP;  We believe that PCs, being free fromtraditional systems hierarchies, can help empower men, women and anybody elsewho uses them.andP;  Our aim is to help everybody get the most from theirPCs.--Mike EdelhartandM;Product OverloadandM;&quot;Confine and Conquer Information Overload&quot; (August, page 70) brought homemany good points.andP;  But it's obvious, however, that the authors' objective wasnot to show the reader how to confine and conquer information overload but towrite an article that showcased five products.andP;  DON WITHROWandM;ANNANDALE, VIRGINIAandM;There are many ways to conquer information overload.andP;  But as a computermagazine, we try to show how to use your PC to solve the problem.andP;  Theproducts we showcased are simply the ones that work best.--Ron WhiteandM;Windows' Real RAMandM;Sorry fellas, but you're both wrong (Seymour vs.andP;  Dvorak, August, page 20).andO;The key point about Windows 3.0 is that it  finally) runs on the 286 CPU aswell as it ever will.andP;  And it flies on a 386 because it uses extended memoryproperly.andP;  All the pretty screens and so on are beside the point.andP;  Windows3.0 means no more slow drivers for expanded memory, no more page frames, nonuthin'.andP;  Just one big chunk of RAM for users to play around in.andM;BRUCE F. MAYERandM;KENMORE,  NEW YORKandM;Contrary to Microsoft's claim, Windows 3.0 does not do away with that awful640K memory barrier for each DOS application (&quot;Windows 3.0: Once You Try It,You'll Be Hooked,&quot; July, page 66).andP;  Each program appears to operate in thelower 640K.andP;  With the overhead required for Windows, non-Windows programsusing more than 540K won't fit.andP;  It's frustrating to have 4MB of memory andstill be limited to DOS programs that use less than 500K.andM;And printing is slow.andP;  The Print Manager is of little use and doesn't spool.andO;The Memory Manager, which is needed if Extended 386 mode is used, isincompatible with most spooling programs.andP;  So I must run Standard mode (whichis faster) with my spooler and lose multitasking with non-Windowsapplications.andM;WILLIAM R. PARRISHandM;BARTLESVILLE, OKLAHOMAandM;Microsoft claims only that Windows 3.0 will let Windows applications use morethan 640K of RAM.andP;  Note that Windows 3.0 does support expanded (EMS) memoryfor DOS applications.andM;Although the Windows 3.0 memory manager was initially incompatible withcurrent third-party memory-management products such as 386MAX and QEMM, newversions of these products should be available by the time you read this,which will let you load TSRs (such as your print spooler) and device driversinto the high memory area, thereby conserving precious conventional RAM.andM;Finally, if WinWord is the only application you ran in Windows, you may wantto consider other products for your multitasking needs.andP;  You couldefficiently multitask your DOS applications with Desqview and n Windows 3.0in real mode in a Desqview partition for instance.andM;Phantom Shopper Too HastyandM;I manage the Burlington, Massachusetts, CompuAdd Superstore visited byPC/Computing's Phantom Shopper (&quot;Phantom Shopper,&quot; Consumer's Edge, August,page 191).andP;  As the Phantom concluded, this is a great place to shop if youdon't want to be pestered by salespeople.andP;  That's the only point I can agreewith.andM;It seems too hasty for the Phantom to conclude that only the CompuAdd salesrepresentatives on the red phone possess true talent.andM;Perhaps, as the Phantom suggested, you caught us on a bad day.andP;  And for that,I apologize.andP;  But I know several hundred people who buy PCs from this storeeach month and who have more favorable opinions of our service.andP;  If thePhantom Shopper would like to visit our store again--to discuss our newestlaptops, networking products and computers--I would like to extend a cordialinvitation.andM;DAVE JONUSKISandM;BURLINGTON, MASSACHUSETTSandM;Aborted TakeoffandM;Thanks very much for Charles Bennett's article on the new hardware for FlightSimulator (&quot;The Ultimate Flight Simulator Lets You Fly with the Eagles,&quot;Prime Time, August, page 202).andP;  Unfortunately, Flight Simulator 4.0 doesn'tfly properly, so why sink your money into these peripherals? Microsoft addedbells and whistles to the latest version but neglected the real reason we ownthe program: to fly a realistic simulation of a real airplane.andM;GARYTH NAIRandM;BASKING RIDGE, NEW JERSEYandM;Toner Cartridges Toss-UpandM;Your August issue included an excellent little box titled &quot;What to Ask WhenBuying a Personal Laser Printer&quot; (Consumer's Edge, page 192).andP;  It recommends:&quot;Find out if the maker will void your printer's warranty if you go to athird-party source for toner.&quot; Will a manufacturer really do this?andM;ROBERT H. BRIDGESandM;GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINAandM;Laser printer manufacturers won't void your warranty if you opt to userefilled toner cartridge unless any damage is directly attributable to thecartridge.andP;  Your dealer, however, may try to tell your otherwises.andP;  To findout what to do in this situation and for tips on refilling your printercartridges, see our October issue's Consumer's Edge (&quot;Recharging Cartridges?andO;Ask the Tough Questions,&quot; page 320).andM;Disk Killer is a VirusandM;Ralph W. Shrader has a virus, not a Trojan horse (Qandamp;A, August, page 151).andO;Patricia Hoffman, of Santa Clara, California, identified it.andM;Known as &quot;Disk Killer,&quot; &quot;Computer Ogre,&quot; &quot;Disk Ogree&quot; and &quot;Ogre,&quot; itoriginated in Taiwan and was isolated in Milpitas, California.andM;It is a  risk sector infector that keeps track of the time elapsed from themoment it invades your system.andM;After about 48 hours, it reboots your system, generating the message &quot;DiskOgre&quot; and displaying a date of April 1.andP;  It warns you not to turn off yourcomputer, then destroys the data on your disk.andM;MAJOR GEORGE OSMERandM;INFORMATION SYSTEMS MANAGERandM;3RD MARINE CORPS AIRCRAFT WINGandM;EL TORO, CALIFORNIAandM;Glasnost for Software PiratesandM;I have a solution to rampant Soviet software piracy that would serve bothAmerican and Soviet interests.andM;A consortium of software vendors from the United States and the Soviet Unioncould sell the latest version of their products in the Soviet Union for hardcurrency and offer the outdated versions for rubles.andM;The profits in rubles could then be donated to help Gorbachev liquidate thestate deficit.andM;This would help Gorbachev stabilize inflation, thereby moving the rublecloser to becoming a convertible currency.andM;In turn, this would open vast new markets for U.S.andP;  software vendors (whowould lose nothing by donating the rubles they earn, since almost allsoftware in the Soviet Union is currently pirated).andP;  And it would encouragethe Soviet Parliament to pass a law protecting intellectual property.andM;STANISLAV DMITRIEVandM;PETROZAVOSK, SOVIET UNIONandM;Interested readers can write Mr. Dmitriev at Karelgrazhdanproject, 12 EngelsStreet, Petrozavosk 185670, U.S.S.R.andP;  And be sure to catch &quot;DOS Kapital,&quot;which begins on page 177.andM;Criminal NerdsandM;A question about &quot;To Catch a Hacker&quot; (August, page 122): Do we really want toprosecute hackers? What do you do with criminal nerds? Jail doesn'trehabilitate the bright; it just makes them angry.andP;  We should rethink ourpractice of putting hackers in prison.andP;  As kids, they are easy to catch.andP;  Asangry adults, however, they will not be.andM;DOC  STANLEYandM;BERKELEY, CALIFORNIAandM;Welcome, Personal's ReadersandM;Thanks for notifying me that Personal Computing has ceased publication.andM;I'm pleased that my subscription to PC/Computing will be extended by thenumber of issues I was owed on my subscription to Personal Computing.andP;  I wantyou to know how much I appreciate your magazine, especially Qandamp;A, Fast Factsand anything written by John Dvorak.andM;PHILIP H.
