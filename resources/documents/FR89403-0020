Introduction</ITAG>A. Test Rule Development Under TSCAThis final rule is part of the overall implementation of section 4 of TSCA(Pub. L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003 <T3>et seq.,</T3> 15 U.S.C. 2601<T3> et seq.</T3>), which contains authority for EPA to require the developmentof data relevant to assessing the risk to health and the environment posedby exposure to particular chemical substances or mixtures (chemicals).Under section 4(a) of TSCA, EPA must require testing of a chemical to developdata if the Administrator makes certain findings as described in TSCA undersection 4(a)(1) (A) or (B). Detailed discussions of the statutory section4 findings are provided in the Agency's first and second proposed testrules published in the <T4>Federal Registers</T4> of July 18, 1980 (45 FR 48510) and June 5, 1981(46 FR 30300). B. Regulatory HistoryThe Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) designated TGME for priority testingconsideration in its sixteenth report published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 21, 1985 (50 FR 20930). In response tothis designation, EPA issued a proposed test rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 15, 1986 (51 FR 17883) requiring thatmanufacturers and processors of TGME test the chemical for developmentalneurotoxicity among other health effects, under sections 4(a)(1) (A) and(B) of TSCA. EPA recently entered a Consent Order with five manufacturersof triethylene glycol ethers to conduct certain toxicologic tests of TGME(notice published elsewhere in this <T4>Federal Register</T4>). Regarding developmental neurotoxicity testing,EPA has chosen to proceed by issuing a final test rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Response to Comments</ITAG>The proposed rule (51 FR 17883) also proposed the developmental neurotoxicityguideline (40 CFR 795.250), and comments were received on both the proposedrule and guideline. Responses to comments on the guideline were publishedwhen the guideline was promulgated with the diethylene glycol butyl etherand diethylene glycol butyl ether acetate final test rule (53 FR 5932;February 26, 1988).Only the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) Glycol Ethers ProgramPanel and the American Industrial Health Council (AIHC) commented on theproposed test rule. Responses to those comments are given below.A. FindingsEPA based the proposed test rule on both TSCA sections 4(a)(1) (A) and(B).CMA and AIHC commented that the Agency did not provide justification forthe section 4(a)(1)(A) finding. Comments 1 through 4 address this finding.1.<T3> Comment:</T3> CMA commented that ``the toxicity data on which EPArelies do not demonstrate any likelihood of unreasonable risks''. Theyfurther went on to state ``EPA argues that adverse effects would be expectedfrom human exposures to the triethylene glycol ethers (51 FR 17885).''<T3>Response:</T3> EPA has not reached any conclusion as to effects ofexposure, but has merely found ``that the use of the triethylene glycolethers * * *<T3> may</T3> present an unreasonable risk * * * ''. EPA has based itsfinding of potential unreasonable risk on (1) a toxicity prediction byuse of a structure-activity relationship, discussed below in EPA's responseto comments 2 and 3a, and (2) human exposure potential as discussed inthe response to comment 5. Findings are detailed in Unit III.A. Testingis required because available data are insufficient to show whether ``adverseeffects would be expected''. If EPA knew with certainty the extent of therisk, EPA would not require testing.2. <T3>Comment:</T3> AIHC commented on EPA's structure-activity relationship(SAR) analysis, which was conducted only with ethylene glycol monomethylether (EGME). AIHC believes that a more refined SAR analysis should beused. The AIHC comments refer to the fact that ``Data on series of glycolethers and experience using similar materials has never resulted in neurologiceffects similar to those observed with EGME for any other glycol ether''.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA is not aware of specific neurotoxicity testing onthe higher congeners, the diethylene or triethylene glycol ethers, butGoldberg <T3>et al. </T3>(Refs. 1 and 2) have done adult neurotoxicity testing withthe monoethylene compounds, just as Nelson <T3>et al. </T3>(Refs. 3, 6, and 7) have done with developmental neurotoxicity.Furthermore, the results of Goldberg <T3>et al.</T3>'s 1962 study with EGME (Ref. 1) on active avoidance paralleledthe effects seen in the offspring exposed <T3>in utero </T3>to EGME (Ref. 3). In addition, effects of EGME seen inadult humans (Ref. 4) are comparable to the symptoms, ataxia and lethargy,seen in rat acute toxicity studies with TGME (Ref. 5). Without data onthe higher congeners, EPA believes it cannot reasonably predict the neurotoxicitypotential of TGME, and that testing is necessary. 3a. <T3>Comment: </T3>AIHC also commented that EPA's use of a single study(Ref. 3) to support the requirement for developmental neurobehavioral toxicitytesting may be inadequate. <T3>Response: </T3>In addition to the reference used in the proposed ruleto support the requirement for developmental neurotoxicity (Ref. 3), Nelson'sgroup tested another ethylene glycol ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether(EGEE), following prenatal exposure in rats (Refs. 6 and 7). At 100 ppm(Ref. 6) statistically significant changes occurred with the rotorod test,the activity wheel test, and avoidance conditioning. At 200 ppm, a maternallytoxic dose, even greater alterations were observed in these tests (Ref.7). All these results (Refs. 3, 6, and 7), constitute an adequate basisfor concern about the potential for developmentally neurotoxic effects.3b. <T3>Comment: </T3>AIHC and CMA questioned the use of a 1984 paper by Nelson<T3>et al. </T3>(Ref. 3) to support the finding. The comments quoted allor part of the following sentence in this paper: ``The absence of morerobust differences here raises doubt regarding the biological significanceof the difference in this group, as compared with those seen in the 2ME7-13 group.'' Other AIHC and CMA comments discuss the following problems with the protocolof the same paper: (1) No appropriate controls of the exposed males; and(2) no randomization in assigning females in the various exposure groups,which they felt might account for the ``consistency of the neurochemicalfindings''. <T3>Response: </T3>These comments (3a, 3b) refer to toxicity testing inthe Nelson paper (Ref. 3) (paternal exposure, neurochemical alterations)which EPA is not requiring in this rule, and which do not bear on the proposedfinding that TGME exposure may present an unreasonable risk of developmentalneurotoxicity. 4. <T3>Comment: </T3>CMA also commented on the rationale for developmentalneurotoxicity testing for risk assessment purposes, and concluded that``although such testing may be of academic interest, it is of no provenvalue to the risk assessment needs that must exist to justify section 4testing requirements''. <T3>Response: </T3>At the time of the proposal, EPA had not previouslyrequired developmental neurotoxicity testing and had never used such testingfor risk assessment purposes. However, EPA has long recognized that thereis a need for this testing, as is discussed below. To fulfill this need,EPA has developed a guideline for this test (40 CFR 795.250). In the early 1970's, the scientific community became concerned that exposureof the mother to drugs or toxic chemicals may result in neurologic effectsin the offspring, as reports proliferated indicating that children bornto chronic alcoholic mothers not only had physical malformations, but anincreased incidence of mental retardation or performance deficits (Refs.8 and 9). The fetal alcohol syndrome, as it is now termed (Ref. 10), isno longer considered an unproven theory, and there have been numerous studiesinvestigating neurobehavioral problems in offspring exposed to other substances<T3>in utero </T3>(Ref. 11). Scientists from various governmental agencies (National Institute for EnvironmentalHealth Sciences, NIEHS; National Center for Toxicological Research, NCTR;Food and Drug Administration, FDA; National Toxicology Program, NTP; NationalInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH; and EPA) instituteda Collaborative Behavioral Teratology Study (CBTS) in 1978 to evaluatethe intra- and interlaboratory reliability and sensitivity of several behavioraltest methods as a preliminary for developing tests useful for ``safetyevaluation in the area of postnatal function'' (Ref. 12). CBTS was initiated,in part, because of a belief that available tests had not been validatedsufficiently for regulatory agencies' risk assessment needs. In addition, EPA's Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) recently reviewed therationale for developmental neurotoxicity testing and concluded that EPAshould require that such testing be conducted in a number of instancesincluding ``strong structure-activity relationships to known neurotoxicants''(Ref. 13). 5. <T3>Comment: </T3>CMA submitted the only comment on the section 4(a)(1)(B)finding, stating that the NIOSH figures are not specific enough about thenumber of persons exposed to the chemical or the duration or extent ofany such exposure to serve as the basis for requiring testing under TSCAsections 4(a)(1)(B). CMA also asserted that EPA failed to take into accountinstructions to the worker about handling the fluid carefully. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA believes that the record supports the TSCA section4(a)(1)(B) finding of ``significant or substantial human exposure'' forTGME. EPA has routinely used and intends to continue to use NIOSH surveystatistics to make section 4(a)(1)(B) findings where appropriate unlessbetter estimates of occupational exposure are developed. Furthermore, EPAhas recently prepared an updated exposure profile of the estimated 175,000mechanics exposed to brake fluids with at least one contact per day resultingin exposures ranging from 250 to 2,300 mg/day for 250 days per year (Ref.14). In addition, the NIOSH figures are not the total basis for the section4(a)(1)(B) finding, and as stated in the proposed rule, EPA believes thatconsumer exposure also occurs through the use of products containing TGME,since some individuals can be expected to add brake fluid or perform brakemaintenance on their own automobiles. Thus EPA has properly concluded thatsubstantial numbers of people may be exposed to TGME and that many of thesepeople may be exposed to significant levels of TGME. B. Route of Exposure <T3>Comment: </T3>Several comments suggested that the oral route of exposurewould be more appropriate than the dermal route in treating females cagedwith offspring. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA agrees and has changed the route of administrationto oral by gavage. C. Economic Impact <T3>Comment: </T3>CMA commented that the proposed testing would be tooexpensive and would have a substantial economic impact on manufacturers.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA has greatly reduced the impact of this final testrule by requiring testing only of TGME, which will represent all threeof the glycol ethers in the proposed test rule. If EPA concludes that testingof the other two is necessary after evaluating the data from this test,it will require this by a separate final rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Final Test Rule </ITAG>A. Findings This test rule is based on the authority of TSCA section 4(a)(1) (A) and(B). Under section 4(a)(1)(A) EPA finds that the use of TGME may presentan unreasonable risk of developmental neurotoxicity on the basis of SARwith EGME and EGEE (Refs. 3, 6, and 7), both of which demonstrate developmentalneurotoxicity, and the exposure to brake fluid which may contain TGME duringuse at levels up to 250 to 2,300 mg/day for up to 250 days per year bymechanics (Ref. 14). Other workplace personnel may be exposed to even higherlevels (Ref. 20). Under section 4(a)(1)(B) EPA finds that TGME is producedin substantial quantities (30 million lbs. in 1986) (Ref. 15). EPA alsofinds that there is or may be substantial human exposure to brake fluids(which may contain TGME) in the workplace, where approximately 250,000workers including 8,000 females (Ref. 16) are exposed. An updated exposurereport (Ref. 14) confirms exposure in that an estimated 175,000 of these250,000 workers are mechanics exposed to brake fluids at least once a day.There also may be substantial consumer exposure to TGME during maintenanceof consumers' own vehicles. EPA also finds that there is or may be significanthuman exposure to TGME in the workplace. EPA also finds that there are no available data to reasonably predict ordetermine the developmental neurotoxicity of TGME and that testing is necessaryto develop this data. Data resulting from the developmental neurotoxicity screen will help EPAdetermine whether TGME is developmentally neurotoxic and whether furthertesting is necessary, and are relevant to determining whether exposureto TGME during use does or does not present an unreasonable risk to humanhealth. B. Required Testing and Test Standard EPA is requiring that developmental neurotoxicity be conducted on TGMEin accordance with the specific guideline in 40 CFR 795.250, as publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 26, 1988 (53 FR 5947). C. Test Substance EPA is requiring that TGME of at least 90 percent purity shall be usedas the test substance. TGME of such purity is available at reasonable cost.D. Persons Required To Test Section 4(b)(3)(B) specifies that the activities for which EPA makes section4(a) findings (manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use,and/or disposal) determine who bears the responsibility for testing a chemical.Manufacturers and persons who intend to manufacture the chemical are requiredto test if the findings are based on manufacturing (``manufacture'' isdefined in section 3(7) of TSCA to include ``import''). Processors andpersons who intend to process the chemical are required to test if thefindings are based on processing. Manufacturers and processors and personswho intend to manufacture and process the chemical are required to testif the exposures giving rise to the potential risk occur during distributionin commerce, use, or disposal of the chemical. Because EPA has found that the use of TGME gives rise to exposure thatmay lead to an unreasonable risk, EPA is requiring that persons who manufactureor process, or who intend to manufacture or process, TGME, other than asan impurity, at any time from the effective date of this final test ruleto the end of the reimbursement period are subject to the testing requirementscontained in this final rule. The end of the reimbursement period willbe 5 years after the last final report is submitted or an amount of timeequal to that which was required to develop data, whichever is later. Because TSCA contains provisions to avoid duplicative testing, not everyperson subject to this rule must individually conduct testing. Section4(b)(3)(A) of TSCA provides that EPA may permit two or more manufacturersor processors who are subject to the rule to designate one such personor a qualified third person to conduct the tests and submit data on theirbehalf. Section 4(c) provides that any person required to test may applyto EPA for an exemption from the requirement. EPA promulgated proceduresfor applying for TSCA section 4(c) exemptions in 40 CFR Part 790. Manufacturers (including importers) subject to this rule are required tosubmit either a letter of intent to perform testing or an exemption applicationwithin 30 days after the effective date of this final test rule. The requiredprocedures for submitting such letters and applications are described in40 CFR Part 790. Although EPA has not identified any individuals who manufactureTGME as a byproduct, such persons will be subject to the requirements ofthis test rule. Processors subject to this rule, unless they are also manufacturers, willnot be required to submit letters of intent or exemption applications,or to conduct testing, unless manufacturers fail to submit notices of intentto test or later fail to sponsor the required tests. EPA expects that themanufacturers will pass an appropriate portion of the costs of testingon to processors through the pricing of their products or other reimbursementmechanisms. If manufacturers perform all the required tests, processorswill be granted exemptions automatically. If manufacturers fail to submitnotices of intent to test or fail to sponsor all the required tests, EPAwill publish a separate notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> to notify processors to respond; this procedureis described in 40 CFR Part 790. EPA is not requiring the submission of equivalence data as a conditionfor exemption from the required testing for TGME. As noted in Unit III.C.,EPA is interested in evaluating the effects attributable to TGME and hasspecified a relatively pure substance for testing. Manufacturers and processors subject to this test rule must comply withthe test rule development and exemption procedures in 40 CFR Part 790 forsingle-phase rulemaking.E. Reporting Requirements EPA requires that all data developed under this rule be reported in accordancewith its TSCA Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) standards, which appear in40 CFR Part 792. In accordance with 40 CFR Part 790, under single-phase rulemaking procedures,test sponsors are required to submit individual study plans at least 45days before initiation of each test. EPA is required by TSCA section 4(b)(1)(C) to specify the time period duringwhich persons subject to a test rule must submit test data. The proposed rule would have required that for range finding for this developmentalneurotoxicity test, developmental toxicity testing in the rat be completedbefore initiating the developmental neurotoxicity study. However, developmentaltoxicity testing in the rat is being performed by the manufacturers undera negotiated Testing Consent Order using the TSCA guideline in 40 CFR 798.4900,as modified (Ref. 17), and developmental neurotoxicity testing under thisrule shall be initiated when the results of the developmental toxicitystudy are submitted to EPA. If neither developmental or maternal toxicityis seen in the developmental toxicity study, the high dose in the developmentalneurotoxicity study shall be 5 grams/kilogram (g/kg). The developmentalneurotoxicity test results shall be submitted within 21 months of EPA'spublication in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of a notice announcing the receipt of the developmentaltoxicity test results. Interim progress reports for the developmental neurotoxicitystudy shall be provided to EPA at 6-month intervals after the initiationof this test, until the final report is submitted to EPA. TSCA section 14(b) governs Agency disclosure of all test data submittedpursuant to section 4 of TSCA. Upon receipt of data required by this rule,EPA will publish a notice of receipt in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>as required by section 4(d). Persons who export a chemical which is subject to a section 4 test ruleare subject to the export reporting requirements of section 12(b) of TSCA.Final regulations interpreting the requirements of section 12(b) are in40 CFR Part 707. In brief, as of the effective data of this test rule,an exporter of TGME must report to EPA the first annual export or intendedexport of TGME to each country. EPA will notify the foreign country concerningthe test rule for TGME. F. Enforcement Provisions EPA considers failure to comply with any aspect of a section 4 rule tobe a violation of section 15 of TSCA. Section 15(1) of TSCA makes it unlawfulfor any person to fail or refuse to comply with any rule or order issuedunder section 4. Section 15(3) of TSCA makes it unlawful for any personto fail or refuse to: (1) Establish or maintain records, (2) submit reports,notices, or other information, or (3) permit access to or copying of recordsrequired by TSCA or any regulation or rule issued under TSCA. Additionally, TSCA section 15(4) makes it unlawful for any person to failor refuse to permit entry or inspection as required by TSCA section 11.Section 11 applies to any ``establishment, facility, or other premisesin which chemical substances or mixtures are manufactured, processed, stored,or held before or after their distribution in commerce * * * .'' EPA considersa testing facility to be a place where the chemical is held or stored and,therefore, subject to inspection. Laboratory inspections and data auditswill be conducted periodically in accordance with the authority and proceduresoutlined in TSCA section 11 by duly designated representatives of EPA forthe purpose of determining compliance with this final rule for TGME. Theseinspections may be conducted for purposes which include verification thattesting has begun, schedules are being met, and reports accurately reflectthe underlying raw data, interpretations, and evaluations, and to determinecompliance with TSCA GLP standards and the test standards established inthis rule. EPA's authority to inspect a testing facility also derives from section4(b)(1) of TSCA, which directs EPA to promulgate standards for the developmentof test data. These standards are defined in section 3(12)(B) of TSCA toinclude those requirements necessary to assure that data developed undertesting rules are reliable and adequate, and to include such other requirementsas are necessary to provide such assurance. EPA maintains that laboratoryinspections are necessary to provide this assurance. Violators of TSCA are subject to criminal and civil liability. Personswho submit materially misleading or false information in connection withthe requirement of any provision of this rule may be subject to penaltieswhich may be calculated as if they never submitted their data. Under thepenalty provisions of section 16 of TSCA, any person who violates section15 of TSCA could be subject to a civil penalty of up to $25,000 for eachviolation with each day of operation in violation constituting a separateviolation. This provision would be applicable primarily to manufacturersthat fail to submit a letter of intent or an exemption request and thatcontinue manufacturing after the deadlines for such submissions. This provisionwould also apply to processors that fail to submit a letter of intent oran exemption application and continue processing after EPA has notifiedthem of their obligation to submit such documents (see 40 CFR 790.28(b)).Knowing or willful violations could lead to the imposition of criminalpenalties of up to $25,000 for each day of violation or imprisonment forup to 1 year, or both. In determining the amount of penalty, EPA will takeinto account the seriousness of the violation and the degree of culpabilityof the violator as well as all the other factors listed in TSCA section16. Other remedies are available to EPA under section 17 of TSCA, suchas seeking an injunction to restrain violations of TSCA section 4. Individuals as well as corporations could be subject to enforcement actions.Sections 15 and 16 of TSCA apply to ``any person'' who violates provisionsof TSCA. EPA may, at its discretion, proceed against individuals as wellas companies themselves. In particular, this includes individuals who reportfalse information or who cause it to be reported. In addition, the submissionof false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements is a violation under 18U.S.C. 1001.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Economic Analysis of Final Rule </ITAG>To assess the potential economic impact of this rule, EPA has preparedan economic analysis (Ref. 18) that evaluates the potential for significanteconomic impact on the industry as a result of the required testing. Theeconomic analysis estimates the cost of conducting the required testingand evaluates the potential for significant adverse economic impact asa result of these test costs by examining four market characteristics ofTGME: (1) Price sensitivity of demand, (2) industry cost characteristics,(3) industry structure, and (4) market expectations. If there is no indicationof adverse effect, no further economic analysis is performed; however,if the first level of analysis indicates a potential for significant economicimpact, a more comprehensive and detailed analysis is conducted which moreprecisely predicts the magnitude and distribution of the expected impact.Total testing costs for the final rule for TGME are estimated to rangefrom $113,800 to $151,900. To predict the financial decision-making practicesof manufacturing firms, these costs have been annualized. Annualized costsare compared with annual revenue as an indication of potential impact.The annualized costs represent equivalent constant costs which would haveto be recouped each year of the payback period to finance the testing expenditurein the first year. The annualized test costs (using a cost of capital of 7 percent over aperiod of 15 years) range from $13,494 to $16,677. Based on the 1986 estimatedproduction volume for TGME of 29.6 million pounds, the unit test costswill be about 0.06 cents per pound. In relation to the selling price of$5.00 per gallon for TGME, these costs are equivalent to 0.17 percent ofprice. Based on these costs and the uses of TGME, the economic analysis indicatesthat the potential for significant adverse economic impact as a resultof this testing rule is low. This conclusion is based on the followingobservations: 1. The estimated unit test costs are very low, 0.17 percent of currentprice in the upper-bound case. 2. The overall demand for TGME appears relatively inelastic. Refer to the economic analysis for a complete discussion of test cost estimationand the potential for economic impact resulting from these costs.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Availability of Test Facilities and personnel </ITAG>Section 4(b)(1) of TSCA requires EPA to consider ``the reasonably foreseeableavailability of the facilities and personnel needed to perform the testingrequired under the rule''. Therefore, EPA conducted a survey to assessthe availability of test facilities and personnel to handle the additionaldemand for testing services created by this section 4 test rule (Ref. 19).On the basis of this study, EPA believes that there will be available testfacilities and personnel to perform the testing specified in this rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI.

Executivce Order 12291 Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a rule is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.EPA has determined that this test rule is not major because it does notmeet any of the criteria set forth in section 1(b) of the Order; i.e.,it will not have an annual effect on the economy of at least $100 million,will not cause a major increase in costs or prices, and will not have asignificant adverse effect on competition or the ability of U.S. enterpriseto compete with foreign enterprises. This rule was submitted to OMB for review as required by Executive Order12291. Any written comments from OMB to EPA, and any EPA response to thosecomments, are included in the rulemaking record. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., Pub. L. 96354, September 19. 1980), EPA is certifying that this test rule will nothave a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses because:(1) they are not likely to perform testing themselves, or to participatein the organization of the testing effort; (2) they will experience onlyvery minor costs, if any, in securing exemption from testing requirements;and (3) they are unlikely to be affected by reimbursement requirements.C. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements contained in this rule have beenapproved by OMB under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44U.S.C. 3502 <T3>et seq. </T3>and have been assigned OMB control number 2070-0033. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedat 1375 hours, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existingdata sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completingand reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 799 </ITAG>Testing, Environmental protection, Hazardous substances, Chemicals, Recordkeepingand reporting requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 24, 1989.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Susan F.
