Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) said he expects themeasure, backed by the White House, to roll quickly throughCongress. &quot;By next week, I am confident Congress will enactthis proposal -- because it has to be a priority -- and sendit to the president for his signature,&quot; Sen. Bentsen said.</LP><TEXT>   The bill is identical to a measure approved this week bythe House Ways and Means Committee. If enacted, thelegislation would allow unemployed workers who have exhaustedstate aid to qualify for a total of 52 or 59 weeks ofbenefits, depending on the level of unemployment in eachstate.   Most of the bill's cost would be paid for by dipping into$2.2 billion in unexpected revenue raised last year byCongress. The $500 million balance would come from raisingthe estimated quarterly tax paid by corporations.
