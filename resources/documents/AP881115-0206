Kennedy.</HEAD><TEXT>   By the 10th anniversary in 1973, reporters were getting latheredup over Watergate. In Dallas, 500 people gathered near theassassination site, but the top news story of the day was an18-minute gap in a Nixon White House tape recording.   The JFK focus in 1973 was shifting to conspiracy theories, fed bybooks and a movie called ``Executive Action'' that laid blame forthe Kennedy killing on a group of greedy Texas oilmen.   ``There's nothing new. My view is the same _ Oswald did all theshooting,'' retired district attorney Henry Wade said in aninterview last month. ``I haven't seen anything to change my mind. Ifeel like somebody might have planted the seed or thought thatsomebody ought to kill him (Kennedy) while in town. But there isabsolutely no proof of anything like that.''   Fifteen years ago, Wade, who would have prosecuted Oswald had helived, was less certain.   ``I find it hard to believe that Oswald didn't have help,'' hetold the AP in 1973. ``Call it a gut feeling on my part. I don'thave any evidence to back it up. But I believe there was aconspiracy. You just don't go downtown one morning and kill thepresident.''   The widow of J.D. Tippit, the police officer Oswald shot afterfleeing the school book warehouse, had remarried by the 10thanniversary. A lawyer said the $600,000 she received from asympathetic public after Tippit's death went into a trust for theirthree children.</TEXT><TEXT>   Unlike the spartan fifth anniversary, the landmark 20th touchedall bases.   Movies, television specials, documentaries, books, magazinearticles and news stories explored the assassination anew.   In 1963, Marina Oswald, at age 22, was a stranger in a foreignland, a frightened young woman with few friends, no money, no job,no future, two infant daughters and a dead husband accused ofkilling the president of the United States.   ``It was horrible,'' she told the AP 20 years later.   ``For a while I thought it would all blow over, just go away. Butnow I accept the fact that I must live with this for the rest of mylife.''   Less than two years after the assassination, Marina marriedKenneth Porter, a carpenter, and they moved to a country house northof Dallas.   She was then and remains today uncertain of Oswald's guilt andwhether he acted alone. She initially agreed with the WarrenCommission that Oswald was the lone assassin, but doubts crept inand she later changed her mind.   But, she told the AP, ``I don't have any desire to waste the restof my life trying to prove something that cannot be proven.''   There are those, however, who are obsessed with doing preciselythat.   In 1983, an AP story first pulled together theories about theBlack Dog Man, the Umbrella Man, the Mafia Con Man, the Tall Trampand a man called Frenchy. The article also looked at publicationscalled ``The Continuing Inquiry,'' ``Coverups!'' and ``Echoes ofConspiracy.''   Those are names and newsletters well-known to the self-described``theorists'' or ``critics'' who claim there is a sinister and stillsecret story behind the assassination.   They raise provocative questions but provide few answers.   That brings us to the 25th anniversary and the latest theories.   A British television documentary entitled ``The Men Who KilledKennedy,'' broadcast Oct. 25, claimed three gangsters fromMarseilles, France, assassinated Kennedy on orders from U.S.organized crime.   The two-hour documentary on Central Television identified thepurported assassins by name and said one was shot to death in Mexicoin 1972, a second was working in Colombia's drug trade and the thirdwas living in Marseilles after his recent release from prison.   But the day after the program aired, a Marseilles newspaperassembled records indicating that two of them could not have been inDallas on Nov. 22, 1963; one was serving on a minesweeper from Oct.16, 1962, to April 16, 1964, according to French navy headquarters,and another was in a Marseilles jail cell that day, according to theJustice Ministry.   In addition, the newspaper account quoted the navy veteran assaying that the third man singled out was also in jail on the day ofthe assassination.   The program was based on a four-year inquiry by American writerand researcher Steve Rivele and the program's British director,Nigel Turner.   In this country, a syndicated television report is reviving thetheory that Kennedy's assassination was an act of revenge byLousiana mob boss Carlos Marcello, who was deported in 1961 bythen-U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy. The program, presented byreporter Jonathan Kwitny, was broadcast in New York Nov. 1 and willair elsewhere this month.   The report said evidence indicated that Oswald and Ruby hadconnections to Marcello: Oswald through his uncle, who purportedlyworked for the Marcello organization, and Ruby through drugtrafficking, which would have been controlled by Marcello.   In a two-hour television special Nov. 2, columnist Jack Andersonargued another theory involving the Mafia, that Kennedy was a victimof underworld figures first hired by the CIA to kill Fidel Castro.Anderson's special says Santo Trafficante, mob boss in Havana beforeCastro took power in 1959, double-crossed the CIA and informedCastro.   Castro then made a deal with Trafficante to kill Kennedy,Anderson theorized. Trafficante allegedly enlisted the suppport oftwo other bosses, Marcello and Sam Giancana, and Oswald was set upas the fall guy. Anderson's special also linked Ruby to the Mafiaplot.</TEXT><TEXT>   Back when the echoes of gunfire were still ringing in DealeyPlaza, the media struggled to define the mood of Dallas and how thecity's right-wing tolerance might have figured in the assassination.   They apparently failed.   D Magazine, a slick Dallas monthly, unveiled its November 1988issue with this cover: ``25 Years Later: Did Dallas Kill Kennedy?''   Inside, there is a story entitled ``Was Dallas a City of Hate?''   The debate goes on.   Robert H. Johnson Jr., the AP's Texas bureau chief who directedthe news agency's assassination coverage, wrote the AP's firststartling words:   ``BULLETIN   ``DALLAS (AP) _ President Kennedy was shot today just as hismotorcade left downtown Dallas. Mrs. Kennedy jumped up and grabbedMr. Kennedy. She cried, `Oh, no!' The motorcade sped on.''   Johnson, recently retired and living in New Mexico, remained inTexas for six years after the shootings. Never once, he said, did hedrive past the book depository without getting a ``prickly feeling''on the back of his neck.   ``I still feel it,'' he said after a visit to Dallas this year.``The event has got some kind of hold on Americans ... and manyforeigners as well. It's hard to explain.''   Barbara Womble cannot explain it either. But she vividlyremembers the look on her fifth-grade teacher's face when hedismissed his pupils in Chicopee Falls, Mass., that Novemberafternoon.   ``Just by his expression, we knew something really big hadhappened,'' she says now.   Ms. Womble, 35, now director of marketing at upscale HighlandPark Village shopping complex in Dallas, said the whole issue ismuddled because the case has never been solved.   ``But to me, the way to work out our emotions of guilt and regretis to discuss them openly and repeatedly,'' she said. ``They justdon't vanish.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Use Antyime</NOTE></DOC>
