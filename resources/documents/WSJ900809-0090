Brauchli   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>04/03/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C12</SO><CO>   EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDA</CO><IN>PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD)STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)</IN><LP>   TOKYO -- As if Tokyo's sorely battered stock market neededmore to worry about, some analysts are getting scared thatmargin calls soon could bring a fresh avalanche of selling.   That fear was lurking in many securities industryofficials' minds yesterday as the Nikkei average of 225stocks took its second-steepest fall ever, plunging 1978.38points, or 6.6%, to 28002.07, narrowly above thepsychologically important 28000-point barrier. The drop, themost devastating yet in a rout of share prices this year,brings the indicator to its lowest level in 15 months. Theworst drop on record is the 3836.48-point decline of Oct. 20,1987, in the midst of the Black Monday crash.</LP><TEXT>   London trading, meanwhile, was shaken by Tokyo's drop, aswell as renewed domestic concerns. A modest round oflast-minute buying trimmed the sharp losses suffered at theoutset of trading, however.   The market rode a rollercoaster in Tuesday morningtrading. After posting gains of about 584 points during thefirst hour, the Nikkei index began to lose ground rapidly. Bylate morning, the index was off more than 300 points fromMonday's close. The Nikkei index then turned around again tocut most of its losses, finishing the morning session at27924.88, down 77.19 points from Monday's close.   Toshihiko Fujiwara, an analyst at New Japan SecuritiesCo., attributed Tuesday morning's early rebound to the yen'sslight recovery in morning trading and to bargain-hunting inthe wake of Monday's plunge. The dollar was quoted at 159.03yen at midmorning, up from 158.95 yen at the New York close.   At the end of Monday's trading in Tokyo, the Nikkei indexwas down 28% from its high of 38915.87, reached at the end oflast year. That drop represents a loss of the equivalent ofmore than $1 trillion in market capitalization.   Turnover was light yesterday and buyers were scarce. Inpart, stockbrokers blamed rising but unsubstantiated concernsthat investment trusts in Japan soon might face bigredemptions from nervous individual investors. Suchredemptions could force the trusts to liquidate theirholdings in the market.   Another worry was a report in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun,the country's leading economic newspaper, that some life andcasualty insurance companies might start liquidating theirstock holdings to return to cash. Although insurers said theyhaven't altered their investment plans, the report causedsome analysts to fear worse declines in Tokyo. Akio Ishida, asenior manager at YTB Investment Management Co., an affiliateof Yasuda Trust andamp; Banking Corp., worries the sell-off couldtrigger a world-wide stock market downturn.   Aggravating those new concerns, the ever-stronger dollarsailed easily higher against the yen. For the first time inthree years, the U.S. currency broke the 160-yen level,before slipping slightly to close Monday in Tokyo at 158.95yen, up from 158.35 late Friday in New York. Investors areconcerned that Japanese authorities may resort to aninterest-rate increase to stem the yen's continuing decline.That would hurt stocks by making fixed-interest investmentsrelatively more attractive and by raising the cost ofborrowing money to invest in the stock market.   Already, the market's severe drop-off is raising concernsthat small investors, who still dominate trading on many daysand have been buying stock in spite of the market's steepdescent, may face difficulties associated with earlier stockpurchases made on credit. Demands by lenders for partial orfull repayment of loans for stock purchases could furthererode confidence and prices on the stock market.   &quot;We will have some more unfortunate affairs, I am afraid,&quot;admits a senior executive at Daiwa Securities Co. &quot;The marginsituation is not so good.&quot;   Indeed, from the stock market's point of view, it has beengetting worse. Recalling that stock prices rebounded afterthe October 1987 Black Monday crash, many small investorshere have kept buying stockseven while the market hasplummeted. As a result, the total value of stock held onmargin in Japan totaled 10.06 trillion yen ($63.59 billion)as of March 23, down fractionally from a record 10.15trillion yen a week earlier, but up sharply from about 7.8trillion yen a year ago.   According to analysts who track the amount of stockoutstanding bought on margin, or credit, the total now isroughly the equivalent of one in every 10 shares thatnormally trade on the market. The percentage is so highbecause as much as two-thirds of the 469.97 trillion yen instock listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchangeis held through cross-ownership of Japanese companies andnever trades. Even still, as many as one in five sharesoutstanding in some stocks is owned on margin.   When an investor buys on margin, he puts down a proportionof a stock's value -- now 40% -- and borrows the rest,usually through a securities company. That gives himleverage; if the stock goes up, he can sell it and reap theprofits on all the stock he controls. The purchase also openshim to big losses; if a stock goes down, a lender usuallywill ask for the borrower to cough up the equivalent of thevalue of the decline in all the stock. Thus an investor whoputs up $40 to buy $100 of stock would have to put up againan amount equal to his entire original investment if thevalue of the stock fell to $60.   Because of yesterday's &quot;decline, almost everybody whobought on credit will be required to put up additionalcollateral,&quot; predicts Toshihiko Yoshimi, a senior analyst atYamaichi Securities Co.   Such margin calls can force small investors to bail out ofstocks. Under Japanese rules, investors have six months toclear up margin transactions that are outstanding.   Benedicte Ivey, a saleswoman at the securities arm of theFrench bank Credit Lyonnais, has compiled a list of publiccompanies that she describes as &quot;margin horrors&quot; because ofthe relatively large amount of their stock held on margin.   Among the companies are such well-known firms as MinebeaCo., a ball-bearing and semiconductor maker, with 7.21% ofits stock as of the start of last week held on margin; NipponMining Co., a metals firm, with 5.73% of its stock held onmargin; Hitachi Zosen Corp., a heavy-equipment maker, with3.53% on margin; and Pioneer Electronic Corp., a consumerelectronics maker, with 6.25% of its stock held on margin.   The Japanese issues with the largest balance of sharesheld on margin were two obscure companies with a closefollowing of market speculators: about 16.5% of the stock inIseki andamp; Co., an agricultural machinery maker, is held onmargin, while more than 22% of the stock in Tsugami Corp., amachine-tool company, is held on margin.   In London, Wall Street's modest comeback from its openinglows helped steady London nerves and led several traders toforecast that today would see U.K. shares on the rise.   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 share index fell26.3 points to 2221.6. The index was down 36.3 points at onepoint, and the day's highs came as trading opened, with theFT-SE 100 off 23.4 points.   The Financial Times 30 share index was off 20.6 points at1748.1. Volume was 515.2 million shares, up from 453.7million shares Friday.   Elsewhere in Europe, prices closed lower in Paris,Frankfurt, Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Madrid andMilan. South African gold stocks closed sharply lower.   Meanwhile, prices closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong,Manila, Wellington, Seoul and Singapore, and were higher inTaipei.   ---                 Weekly Percentage Leaders                                                                                                          Last week's best and worst performing stocks among thoseissues that make up 80% of the world's stock marketcapitalization (in local currency)                                                                                                          ISSUE (COUNTRY)                          CLOSE     %CHG                                                                                                                             WINNING ISSUES                                                                                                          Regal International (Hong Kong)            2.55   +32.1   Nikon (Japan)                           1450.0    +28.3   Hitachi Chemical (Japan)                1800.0    +27.7   Nippon Credit Bank (Japan)             16700.0    +23.7   NGK Spark Plug (Japan)                  1490.0    +23.1   American General Corp (U.S.)              38.625  +22.1   Matsushita-Kotobuki Elec (Japan)        2590.0    +21.6   Imperial Corp (U.S.)                       0.141  +20.0   Mazda Motor (Japan)                      845.0    +19.0                                                                                                                              LOSING ISSUES                                                                                                          Mitsubishi Steel Mfg (Japan)            1450.0    -23.3   Daikyo (Japan)                          2930.0    -20.7   Metana Minerals (Australia)                1.32   -20.6   Fukuyama Transporting (Japan)           1330.0    -20.4   Amalgamated Steel (Singapore)              3.317  -19.9   Carlton Communications (Britain)           5.45   -19.9   United Plantations (Singapore)             2.335  -19.5   Toyo Sash (Japan)                       5600.0    -18.3   United Paper Ord (Finland)               181.0    -17.7   Bell Resources (Australia)                 0.3    -16.7                                                                                                          Source: Morgan Stanley Capital Intl.
