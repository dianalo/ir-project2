PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Workers stayed home again Tuesday in a region ofthe Caucasus whose Armenian majority is trying to force the Sovietbureaucracy to reverse a decision it made about local rule 65 yearsago.   ``My report today will be short,'' Izvestia correspondent P.Gutiontov wrote from Stepanakert, the largest city of the disputedNagorno-Karabakh region. ``City enterprises are at standstill,people are home.''   About 75 percent of Nagorno-Karabakh's 157,000 people are ethnicArmenians, but the Kremlin assigned it to neighboring Azerbaijan in1923. Most Armenians are Christians. Azeris, the indigenous peopleof Azerbaijan, are predominantly Moslem.   Izvestia, the government newspaper, also gave the firstbreakdown of Armenian and Azeri casualties in Feb. 28 rioting inthe city of Sumgait in Azerbaijan, and denied reports that childrenwere killed.   A curfew was imposed on Sumgait after the riots but Pravda, theCommunist Party daily, said it was lifted Tuesday because ``life inthe city ... has returned to normal.''   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a newsbriefing some workers in Stepanakert stayed home and ``certainenterprises are not functioning or are partially not functioning.''   Telephone calls to Stepanakert from Moscow did not go through orwere cut off.   Izvestia also reported Monday that residents of Stepanakertstayed home. Dissident sources say the strike began last week, buttheir reports could not be confirmed.   Soviet officials, who have announced a costly program to improvesocial and economic conditions in Nagorno-Karabakh, will not bendto pressure from activists to allow Armenia to annex the region,Gerasimov said.   ``We believe that problems have to be solved ... on the basis ofrealism and without undue emotion,'' Gerasimov said. ``One cannotsolve these complex problems with demonstrations only.''   ``We cannot solve the problem by mechanically transferring thisregion as some Armenian officials want,'' he said. ``The more youstudy this problem the more you will see the whole thing is not assimple as that, as merely saying Nagorno-Karabakh must be part ofArmenia.''   Gerasimov said the situation had improved but not enough for thegovernment to allow foreign journalists to travel there.   Sporadic strikes and protests have been reported inNagorno-Karabakh since Feb. 13. The latest labor trouble is said tohave begun last Wednesday.   Izvestia quoted investigators as confirming the previouslyannounced death toll of 32 in the Sumgait riot. It said 26 of themwere Armenians and six were from Azerbaijan. Previously, officialshad said the 32 dead were of various nationalities, and that therioting was not necessarily an ethnic dispute.   Armenian activists had claimed the death toll was much higherand that most of the dead were Armenians.   ``It has been firmly established with evidence that during thedisorder in Sumgait not one child suffered,'' Izvestia quotedinvestigators as saying. ``There were not 400 or 500 deaths, butexactly 32 people, as said in a published statement by the Sovietprosecutor. Included in these 32 were 26 Armenians and sixAzerbaijanis.''   Armenian activists have claimed that small children were thrownfrom the windows of maternity hospitals during the riot.   Izvestia said the strike would not help Stepanakert residents,and accused activists of lack of concern for the region's welfare.   Its article Tuesday and a report it published Monday were partof a new, more detailed look at the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute.   Soviet media are being encouraged under Communist Party chiefMikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost to be more open aboutsocial problems, but initial reports on the Nagorno-Karabakhdispute were slow in coming and lacked detail.   Sovietskaya Kultura said Tuesday the government's plan forNagorno-Karabakh would cost about $640 million.   ``These millions, which are so necessary now for restructuring,the country is giving to Karabakh,'' it said in a front-pagearticle tracing the unrest to poor social and economic conditions.   Moscow dissident Tamara Grigoryants said police broke up ademonstration Monday evening in Yerevan, capital of Soviet Armenia,by more than 50 people demanding freedom for jailed Armenianactivist Paryur Arikyan.   She said they carried saying, ``We don't believe inperestroika,'' a reference to Gorbachev's effort to restructureSoviet society.</TEXT></DOC>
