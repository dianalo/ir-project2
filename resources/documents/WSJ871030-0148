The suit represents the latest salvo in a dispute about rights to the drug, erythropoietin, or EPO, which is regarded as one of most promising products in biotechnology's pipeline. Earlier this week, Amgen won a U.S. patent covering genetic materials and other ingredients used in making genetically engineered versions of the drug. Based on that patent, Amgen filed infringement suits against its competitors in the EPO race, including Genetics Institute.    But last summer, Genetics Institute won its own patent on a purified, naturally occurring form of EPO. Genetics Institute's lawsuit asserts that Amgen's genetically engineered version of EPO is the same as the form of the drug covered by Genetics Institute's patent, said Bruce Eisen, Genetics Institute's vice president and chief patent counsel. &quot;We knew they were infringing on our patent before this, but we had hoped that reason would prevail and that we could reach a business settlement&quot; on the matter out of court, Mr. Eisen added.    In Thousand Oaks, Calif., Philip Whitcome, Amgen's director of strategic planning, said Amgen expects to prevail. &quot;Given the breadth of our patent, we see little incentive to pursue&quot; an out-of-court settlement with Genetics Institute, he added. &quot;Now we'll have a chance to examine the issues and settle them in the courts.&quot;    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Genetics Institute shares closed at $16.75, up $2.25, while Amgen closed at $22.75, up $2.50.    Genetics Institute's suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, includes as a plaintiff Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., a Japanese concern that has licensed Genetics Institute's version of genetically engineered EPO. </TEXT></DOC>
