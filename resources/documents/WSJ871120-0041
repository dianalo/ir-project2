The board of governors of New York's Commodity Exchange, in a move that typically lowers prices, raised the original margin requirement for the December copper-futures contract after trading closed Wednesday. The margins -- good-faith deposits to buy or sell contracts -- were increased to 50% of a contract's value, effective Nov. 30.    Contrary to the usual reaction, futures prices, after dipping slightly, were up more than 4.50 cents a pound at one point. They settled 3.7 cents higher at $1.076 for the December contract. The March contract advanced 1.8 cents to 97.8 cents.    Increased margins usually have their intended effect: taking the steam out of heavy trading that is propelling a contract's surge. The higher cost of trading, or of holding onto a position, normally causes a significant amount of liquidation or the transferring of positions to contracts for delivery in later months, and a subsequent softening in values.    The December premium over March increased 1.9 cents, to 9.8 cents a pound. The premium on Nov. 11 rose to 13.2 cents, when the December contact rose to a life-of-contract high of $1.092.    As of yesterday's close, margins called for in the December contract account for about 21.5% of the contract value for speculative positions and about 13.4% for hedging positions.    A significant number of traders have already transferred out of the December contract. But a hard core of traders apparently has decided to stay in the contract because of the tightness in supply, analysts said, and this contributed to yesterday's price rise.    The exchange's action didn't increase copper supplies, noted J. Clarence Morrison, first vice president for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., and may have spotlighted scarce inventories even more.    &quot;There is a definite note of concern over the availability of copper, not only for the near term, but for the intermediate and long term, ranging into late 1988,&quot; Mr. Morrison said. This &quot;may be leading some traders to stay in the December contract for the purpose of receiving delivery of the copper.&quot;    Alexander P. Paris, president of Barrington Research Associates Inc., a Barrington, Ill., institutional-brokerage firm, agreed, saying the exchange &quot;is about the only place that fabricators and other consumers can find copper these days.&quot;    Metal fabricators are scrambling to find copper to use in filling first-quarter orders, he said. &quot;Even if demand for their products slumps some in the second quarter, fabricators won't cut back their buying because they're working with such small inventories,&quot; Mr. Paris said.    There will be an eventual cooling down of copper demand, he predicted, &quot;but even so, we haven't yet seen the end of higher copper prices.&quot;    In other commodity markets yesterday:    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Rumors of additional Soviet purchases of soybean meal lifted prices of soybean and meal futures in late trading. After the market closed, the Agriculture Department said the Soviets had bought 700,000 metric tons of meal, bringing the total purchased since last week to 1.3 million metric tons. December-delivery soybean-meal contracts closed at $202.20 a ton, up $4.40. Speculation that the Agriculture Department's December deficiency payments to farmers, which total about $1.3 billion, would all be in generic certificates hurt corn prices. The certificates can be used to redeem surplus government grain. The department hasn't said how the payments will be made. Wheat also finished lower.    COFFEE: Futures prices advanced, closing at the day's high, amid continued tightness in supplies of better grades of coffee and seasonally strong demand, according to analysts. December-delivery coffee rose 1.58 cents a pound to $1.2925. Roasters typically become more active buyers of green beans this time of year to prepare for the high-consumption winter months. They are encountering difficulty in finding higher-quality grades of coffee, analysts said. An analyst added that prices were supported by a second reduction of 1.5 million bags in world-export quotas -- set for the beginning of next year -- which will further decrease the amount of coffee available. A bag is 132 pounds.    ENERGY: The oil market &quot;essentially took a breather,&quot; an analyst said, following Wednesday's gyrating trading in which crude-oil futures fell to as low as $18.05 a barrel but closed 59 cents higher than that. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December crude contract, which expires today, closed seven cents lower yesterday at $18.57 a barrel. The January-delivery contract settled at $18.46 a barrel, down 13 cents. &quot;All day long, there was just no clear direction at all,&quot; said Eric Bolling, a vice president at Geldermann Inc. brokers, New York. Andrew Lebow, oil analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York, said the market's failure to break the $18 barrier Wednesday, as some analysts had predicted, has left the market in &quot;a state of flux. There was no flow today at all.&quot; In Europe, the price of North Sea Brent, an abundantly traded crude, rose sharply after New York's strong close Wednesday night. But prices eased to $17.60 a barrel, up 20 cents, after it was clear the New York market wasn't following through on its day-earlier rise. Meanwhile, following the move of other refiners, Mobil Corp.'s Mobil Oil unit lowered by 50 cents, to $18 a barrel, the posted price it will pay for the U.S. benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate. </TEXT></DOC>
