Fearing loss of privacy as well as inconvenience caused byconstruction work, residents of the central Amsterdam districthousing the last home of the world-famous teen-age Nazi victim havewritten a letter protesting the four-year renovation plan.   The Dutch capital's agency for the preservation of monuments isalso opposed to the project, with its director saying the plan will``destroy ... the memories it conveys.''   At issue is an ``urgently necessary project to create sufficientroom'' for the Anne Frank House's 560,000 annual visitors, saidNico Salm, a spokesman for the foundation that owns the building.   Pending City Hall approval, the $6 million renovation is tostart in January, Salm said in an interview Tuesday.   Anne Frank was a Jewish girl whose posthumously published diaryon her life-in-hiding in an annex behind the Amsterdam canal housegained her a worldwide audience. In the closing weeks of World WarII, she died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp at the age of15 after having been caught in 1944.   The museum not only tells the story of Anne's short life _including a display of the annex in its original state _ but alsostages exhibitions on topics related to racism and repression.   Opened in 1960 and consisting of two 18-foot-wide canal housesbuilt in the 18th century, the museum ``needs to be rearrangedinternally to improve access to the annex and the other displays,''Salm said.   ``Right now, throngs of visitors are completely jamming thepremises so that the museum is almost collapsing under its ownsuccess,'' Salm said. Under the new plan, the space dedicated tothe exhibition is to be tripled.   ``The renovation project is not aimed at attracting even morevisitors, but to create a better atmosphere and more space for thesame amount of them,'' said Salm, who noted that on some busysummer days, the museum is closed down for hours at a time to avoidtraffic jams inside.   In their letter, the neighbors said a planned all-glassextension in the museum's garden, which borders their houses, willlead to an ``unacceptable'' loss of privacy and a decline in thevalue of their real estate.   They said they feared the construction work involved in theproject will cause inconvenience ``for years to come.'' A copy ofthe letter was obtained by The Associated Press, but none of thesignatories was available for comment.   Jan Dekkers, the director of Amsterdam's Bureau for Monumentpreservation, said the 1,116-square-foot garden extension, which isto be used as an exposition and lecture hall, ``is simply toobrazen ... it will definitely destroy the authenticity of thecomplex, of the memories it conveys.''   Mels Crouwel, the architect of the renovations, said that ``allpossible care has been taken to avoid vistas by the public into theneighboring gardens.''   The rest of the work will involve extensive renovations,maintenance, and a complete reshuffle of the displays, as well asconservation of the annex, where Anne and her family lived from1942-44.   Tipped off by a Nazi collaborator, the German police raided theannex in August 1944, and Anne, her sister and their parents wereamong the estimated 100,000 Dutch Jews deported to theextermination camps during the five-year Nazi occupation of theNetherlands.   Only 10 percent of those returned after the war, among themAnne's father, Otto, who published his daughter's diary in 1947.Since then, the book has been translated into dozens of languagesand millions of copies have been sold.</TEXT></DOC>
