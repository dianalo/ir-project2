As the voltage harmonic distortion, at a given pointin the network, is the result of the different current injections ofloads at any voltage level, the important problem rises of how to sharethe permitted disturbance level between the various categories of load.To this purpose a methodology was developed that allows the characterizationof a network, through some simple coefficients, on the basis of the propagationof harmonics and of forecasts of disturbing load diffusion. Two harmonicdistortion resulting at a given voltage level is then easily evaluated,by means of these coefficients, starting from the allowed disturbancelevel to the various categories of loads. Different hypotheses on thesharing of the allowed disturbance can then be compared in order to preparesuitable standards. The paper gives details on the method (which is basedon a computer program that was developed, as in other countries, to allowthe evaluation of the harmonic propagation through the network) and onits application to ENEL (Italian National Electricity Board)'s networks.The paper also shows one example of the application of this methodologyto the problem of assessment of standards for industrial disturbing loads.</TEXT></DOC>
