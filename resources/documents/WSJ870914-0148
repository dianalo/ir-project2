Lenders last week were asking, on average, a 10.91% interest rate on 30-year, conventional fixed-rate mortgages, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. That was more than a quarter of a percentage point above the 10.63% rate a week earlier and almost a full point above the 9.96% rate last year.    It was the highest level since Jan. 24, 1986, when such mortgages were offered at an average rate of 10.97%, according to the Freddie Mac survey. Conventional mortgages aren't insured by the government.    Several analysts said underlying factors affecting long-term money rates, such as concerns about inflation and a weakening dollar, indicate further increases are likely by year-end and into 1988. Analysts differed on when the expected increase would occur and how far it would go.    &quot;We see rising interest rates for the next 12 to 18 months,&quot; said Richard Peach, a senior economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. &quot;How high they're going to go, we're not quite sure.&quot;    Analysts also said rates could stabilize at their current level for several months before surging again in early 1988.    &quot;What we've had (throughout 1987) are periods when rates are kind of stable, and then, bang, they went up, and they go back to being stable for a while,&quot; said Robert Van Order, Freddie Mac's chief economist. &quot;It's quite possible that the market has adjusted as much as it wants to for now.&quot;    David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said he expects rates to hover at current levels until 1988 and then &quot;move even a little higher than that.&quot; Mr. Peach of the mortgage-bankers group said he expects an increase of at least half a percentage point by mid-1988.    Meanwhile, HSH Associates, a private mortgage-tracking firm, foresees a sharper increase. &quot;We're expecting as high as 11.5% by the end of the year, and judging by what's been happening in the past two weeks, that may be conservative,&quot; said Keith Gumbinger, a member of the firm.    Rates for adjustable-rate mortgages increased slightly. The average effective commitment rate on 30-year, conventional adjustable-rate mortgages indexed to one-year Treasury notes rose to 7.96% last week from 7.84% the previous week.    A separate survey by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board reflected the relative stability that prevailed through the summer. It showed that the average effective interest rate for conventional fixed-rate mortgages in early August was 10.7%, down slightly from 10.71% in early July. The figures apply to mortgages maturing in 25 years or more on newly built singlefamily homes.    The Bank Board said lenders in early August were seeking an average effective interest rate of 8.62% on the most popular type of adjustable loans, those that restrict rate increases. That was down from the 8.71% rate a month earlier. Rates on adjustable mortgages without rate limits declined to 8.32% from 8.34%.    Analysts said the spread between fixed and adjustable loans likely will push more borrowers to choose the floating-rate loan. Bank Board figures indicate that the adjustable-rate mortgage share of loans closed in early August edged up to 50% from 49% in early July.    The Bank Board said the average price of a new home rose to a record $141,200 in early August, surpassing the $136,900 record set in April. The August figure was up from a revised $134,600 in early July. The July figure was previously reported as $129,000. </TEXT></DOC>
