Internal HUD records show that funding for the 316-unit, Amherst, N.Y., project was awarded in an irregular fashion and that a critical waiver of federal regulations was granted in 1988, saving the developers from losing their $1.8 million annual rent subsidy.    One of the developers, Stephen Ross, a prominent Manhattan real estate executive, contributed $100,000 to the Republican Party last year. His spokesman said the donation wasn't connected to the Amherst project, known as the Allenhurst apartments. Mr. Ross was represented in the project by the New York law firm of Battle, Fowler, of which Mr. Pierce used to be a partner.    Battle Fowler, which has represented Mr. Ross since 1972, also served as attorneys for the underwriters on a New York state revenue bond issue that was used to finance renovation of the multimillion dollar project. The firm, which didn't return phone calls, was paid about $25,000 by the underwriters for its work on the bond issue, according to New York state officials.    The second major partner in the project, Dennis Penman, was chairman of the Erie County, N.Y., 1984 Reagan-Bush campaign committee and also a longtime friend and fund-raiser for former Republican Rep. Jack Kemp, the current HUD secretary whose congressional district included the Buffalo, N.Y., suburbs.    Mr. Penman, executive vice president of a prominent Amherst, N.Y., real estate concern known as M.J. Peterson Co., said Mr. Kemp played no role in the project's funding. Mr. Kemp's spokeswoman said he didn't know anything about the project.    Government records and interviews showed that Mr. Penman played a key role in obtaining funds for the Allenhurst project. A HUD inspector general's audit of the project and other documents strongly suggest that he had inside information enabling him to win backing. But Mr. Penman insisted in interviews that he enjoyed no such advantage and had always operated &quot;in good faith and above board.&quot;    The Allenhurst project, whose subsidy will total $26.6 million over 15 years, was approved by HUD for funding in December 1984, according to HUD records. A letter in the files of Mr. Pierce, released last week by HUD officials, indicates his former executive assistant, Deborah Gore Dean, played an important role in lining up HUD support for the project.    In a February 1985 letter, a Battle Fowler partner, Martin Edelman, wrote Ms. Dean asking for help in obtaining funds for a second rent-subsidy project. Referring to the Allenhurst project, he wrote: &quot;You may remember that you helped us achieve a similar transaction through the New York State Housing Finance Agency last year.&quot; A copy of the letter was sent to Mr. Pierce's confidential assistant, Starr Eckert.    As has been the case throughout the three-month-old HUD scandal, Mr. Pierce didn't return phone calls seeking comment.    Ms. Dean's attorneys, Charles Leeper and Joseph Artabane, said in a brief statement that the existence of Mr. Edelman's letter in Mr. Pierce's files shows &quot;whatever involvement Ms. Dean had in the decision-making process occurred with the knowledge and approval&quot; of Mr. Pierce.    Irregularities in the Allenhurst funding process are listed in the inspector general's report on the project and other records obtained by The Wall Street Journal.    Money for rent-subsidy projects, including the Allenhurst one, came from discretionary funds that were controlled by Mr. Pierce and his staff. The funds were supposed to be awarded to developers by state and local public housing authorities after competitive bidding, but investigators have found that the competitive process sometimes was ignored.    In the Allenhurst case, rent subsidy funds are being funneled to the developers through the New York State Housing Finance Agency. The state agency awarded the funds to the Penman-Ross partnership after applying to HUD for the money. That was the only time it has ever sought funds under the rent-subsidy program.    Mr. Penman said the New York agency also issued about $8.5 million in tax-exempt revenue bonds to provide construction and permanent financing for the project. He said the debt will be paid off by the partnership over 30 years. The project also is insured by HUD.    The inspector general's audit and related documents explore how Mr. Penman got the New York agency to apply for HUD funds. One inspector general interview report quotes Kenneth Lobene, a HUD official in Buffalo, as saying Mr. Penman told him that he had access to rent-subsidy funds in Washington. Mr. Penman denies making such statements and said he was misunderstood.    Mr. Penman in 1984 asked Belmont Shelter Corp., a nonprofit organization that acts as a public housing authority for Erie County, to apply for HUD rent subsidies for Allenhurst. Belmont turned him down because his request was for too many units and because the organization already had a waiting list of 86 proposals. A Belmont official told the inspector general that it hadn't received any rent-subsidy funds under the discretionary program.    The inspector general's documents show Mr. Penman turned to the New York State Housing Finance Agency at the suggestion of a Buffalo HUD official. The New York agency requested funds from HUD in a Nov. 21, 1984, letter to a senior HUD official in Washington. A copy was sent to Ms. Dean.    Within three weeks, HUD notified the state agency of the award. The New York agency, in turn, made the funds available to the Allenhurst project, without publicly advertising the availability of the rent-subsidy funds as required by HUD regulations.    A HUD team uncovered the failure to comply with the public-notice requirement when it reviewed the New York state agency in May 1987. In Washington, HUD staffers who reviewed the situation recommended that funding for the Allenhurst project be cancelled.    But a senior HUD official, Hunter Cushing, urged that officials grant a retroactive waiver of the public-notice requirement. Mr. Cushing argued that if the contract with Allenhurst were canceled and the developers defaulted, HUD might have to pay an $8.6 million claim because the project was fully insured by HUD.    HUD officials in Washington and Buffalo ultimately approved the waiver. A former senior HUD official said the department had no choice but to grant the waiver or face a possible large insurance claim. But this official stressed that HUD had failed to monitor the project closely and should never have allowed funds to be awarded on a preferential basis and without competitive bidding.    Messrs. Penman and Ross over the years have been heavily involved in HUD-related projects. Mr. Ross declined to be interviewed, but his spokesman, Martin McLaughlin said, &quot;I know that Steve was not peddling influence.&quot; He added: &quot;He was financially backing the deal and Penman came to him with the deal.&quot; He said that although Mr. Pierce's old firm, Battle Fowler, had represented Mr. Ross and his company, Related Companies, Inc., for years, Mr. Ross didn't know Mr. Pierce.    Mr. McLaughlin also said Mr. Ross made his $100,000 political contribution last year in response to a GOP &quot;Team 100&quot; campaign soliciting donations of that amount for use at the state or national level.    Mr. Penman said he had met Mr. Pierce and once organized a June 1984 Buffalo event in which Mr. Pierce visited one of his projects. But he said he had never talked to Mr. Pierce about the Allenhurst project. He said he learned that rent-subsidy funds might be available in 1984 through his involvement with the National Association of Home Builders. </TEXT></DOC>
