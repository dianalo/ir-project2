It focuseson the aggregate behavior of the Iranian economy through a simple lineareconometric model. After a survey of the literature on the theoreticalframework of macroeconomic models for the developing countries in general,and for the oil-exporting developing countries in particular, a lineareconometric model for the Iranian economy if formulated and its logicaland economic aspects are explained. The proposed model consists of basicconsumption, production, foreign trade, and employment relationship.Results obtained from the estimation of the consumption functions seemto indicate that the aggregate Iranian consumption behavior can be bestexplained by Fiedman's Permanent Income Hypothesis. In general, the resultsof this study demonstrate that the links between different sectors ofthe Iranian economy are very weak and the import-substitution strategyof the government during the period of study failed to establish a genuinedomestic industrial base and to reduce its dependence on foreign resources.</TEXT></DOC>
