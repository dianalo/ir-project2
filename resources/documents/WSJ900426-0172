Itconcerned limiting the use of a medical technology until ithas been proven safe and effective for a given medicalcondition.   The proposed treatment of kidney cancer with a bone marrowtransfusion, a very expensive procedure often associated withharmful side effects, has no scientific basis as a treatmentin this instance. Such inappropriate use of medicaltechnology has been estimated to contribute as much as 50% ofthe increase in our nation's annual health-care costs.</LP><TEXT>   Implicit rationing or &quot;silent rationing&quot; has been with usfor many years as you indicate, but while rationing has beenadvocated as a means to control health-care costs, it has notbeen adopted as official national policy. As you point out,the fact that 30 million (actually, more than 35 million)Americans have no health insurance constitutes a form ofrationing. In my view, the large number of our citizens whohave little or no access to health care is a nationaldisgrace. There are many steps we could take to make oursystem more efficient; one of these steps could be to reducethe inappropriate and wasteful use of expensive medicaltechnologies.
