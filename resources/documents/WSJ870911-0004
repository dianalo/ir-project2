Oscar M. Tharp was fired as president and chief executive officer of the Pensacola-based thrift, Florida's oldest. He was succeeded by Barney B. Burks Jr., who had been First Mutual's vice chairman.    Mr. Burks said he believes criminal acts may have occurred. He said the thrift isn't sure how much money is involved. &quot;We don't know to what extent these improprieties have gotten to,&quot; he said. &quot;We have an audit going on right now.&quot;    But he said the amount doesn't range into the millions. The thrift, which has assets of nearly $850 million, said in a prepared statement that its board has determined that &quot;these developments&quot; shouldn't affect its financial condition.    Nor, it said, should the matter affect the completion of First Mutual's acquisition by AmSouth Bancorp., Birmingham, Ala. As previously reported, AmSouth agreed earlier this year to buy First Mutual for $56.5 million in cash and stock.    First Mutual is a state-chartered institution. Florida banking officials declined to comment on the matter, except to say that they planned to investigate it. But a spokeswoman for the Federal Home Loan Bank, whose Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp. arm insures Florida Mutual's deposits, when asked if the allegations concerned theft from Florida Mutual, said, &quot;That was the substance of what they were going to announce.&quot;    First Mutual said its board is continuing to investigate the matter, and has referred the situation to state and federal authorities. The Jacksonville office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had been informed of the matter but declined further comment.    In addition to Mr. Tharp, the thrift said it fired John O'Donnell, who had been executive vice president. First Mutual said Mr. Tharp also resigned as a director. Neither could be reached for comment. No successor was announced for Mr. O'Donnell. The thrift's chairman remains Vince Whibbs, who is Pensacola's mayor. Mr. Burks, the new president and chief executive, formerly was mayor of Pensacola.    Mr. Burks said the alleged impropriety was discovered about a week ago by the thrift's internal auditors, who took the matter to the board.    &quot;It was two bright young men,&quot; he said. &quot;You can never understand this kind of thing. I can't imagine how those people would do things like that.' He declined to elaborate.    A spokesman for AmSouth declined to comment, except to confirm that the matter wouldn't affect the pending acquisition, which was the first interstate acquisition announced by an Alabama bank, according to AmSouth.    The personnel changes at First Mutual follow by only a few days the resignation of the chairman and two other members of the board of another Florida Panhandle thrift, First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association of Panama City, Fla. An official of that institution said those moves were made to appease federal regulators unhappy with the thrift's loan practices between 1984 and 1986. But no allegations of impropriety were made in connection with those moves. </TEXT></DOC>
