Although a neck chain or bracelet can be cumbersome towear while exercising, athletes can use the back plate or wristband of theirsport watches to write or engrave vital information. Engraving a name anddriver's license number, for example, costs approximately $7.;   &quot;The mostimportant thing for athletes who have unusual medical conditions is to makesure they include that information with their identification,&quot; says Dr. HowardKlein, a veteran long-distance runner and triathlete. &quot;When someone isadmitted into an emergency room the attending medical personnel must know, forexample, if the patient is allergic to penicillin or if they're diabetic.&quot;;  In addition to inscribing the back of a watch, athletes also can carryidentification tags and emergency money in small shoe pouches. One of the mostefficient and inexpensive varieties is the &quot;Freestyle Wallet.&quot;;   The 3-inchlong nylon sack, which retails for less than $3, includes a Velcro fastenerand a nylon band that attaches easily and securely to shoelaces. A metal orplastic identification card and money will easily fit into the wallet. Othershoe identification products include adhesive strips that attach to the frontor sides of shoes.;   Beyond carrying proper identification, athletesconsidering solitary exercise should follow rules of common sense.;   One ofthe most foolhardy practices among the fitness masses is the use of headphoneswhile exercising. Although music can be soothing and inspiring, athleteswearing headphones often cannot hear oncoming vehicles, other athletes or evenpossible attackers.;   Several other common-sense precautions are easy toforget, but they are equally important for safe, individual exerciseworkouts.;   (check) Vary solo running, biking, hiking or walking routes andtimes. Identical workouts can allow strangers to monitor an athlete'sschedule.;   (check) Never assume vehicles or other athletes have you in clearvision, day or night. Trust your own sight more than someone else's. Ifexercising after sundown, wear reflective clothing and use properly lightedequipment.;   (check) Never disregard a traffic signal, pedestrian regulationsor other official signs because you might &quot;ruin&quot; a workout. If the sign saysSTOP, do so, even if you're running the fastest mile in your life.;   (check)If possible, tell someone or leave a note if you're going for a long soloworkout in case there's an emergency. Include destination and anticipatedreturn time.;   (check) Always carry a water bottle if you're training in anunfamiliar area. Dehydration can develop quickly during strenuous workouts inwarm or cool climates.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JAMES RAIA, Health andamp; Fitness News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910925  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  508  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, September 25, 199100269131,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
