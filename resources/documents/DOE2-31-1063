P2/sub 1//c, unit cell parameters -a=8.836(4), b=14.712(6), c=16.816(7), {beta}=95.37(4) deg, Z=2 are investigated.Positions of equatorial ligands in the dimer with quadruple bond metal-metaloccupy chlorine atoms and oxygen atoms of two bridge formate groups.The third formate group binds the complexes in a chain so that two oxygenatoms are axial ligands in two neighbouring dimers. The forth formategroup in the form of the free molecule of formic acid is in vacanciesof the crystal.</TEXT></DOC>
