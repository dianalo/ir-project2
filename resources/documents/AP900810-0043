The Coast Guard said it hoped to fully open the Houston ShipChannel, which courses through the bay, to all traffic today forthe first time since a tanker collided with two barges on July 28.A sunken barge is obstructing the waterway.   Texas Health Commissioner Robert Bernstein said bay shrimpingcould resume today. But he cautioned shrimpers and consumers tobeware of fish with visible oil, or fish caught in oily water.   Bernstein shut down the bay to all fishing on Aug. 2 because ofa 17-mile slick. Two days later, he reopened the bay to fin fishingand allowed seafood harvesting in some areas.   Shrimpers said the ban cost them thousands of dollars a day. Aban also was lifted today on the taking of crabs and oysters.   ``This is clearly good news for the men and women who rely onthe bay for their livelihoods,'' Gov. Bill Clements said.   The spill occurred when a Greek tanker collided with two bargesunder tow. One barge sank and the other ruptured, spilling heavyoil that threatened sensitive marshes, birds and other wildlife.   Coast Guard spokesman Rick McCullor said salvage crews wereexpected to end the cleanup today and reopen the channel to alltraffic. Crews used cutting torches to take apart the sunken bargeand removed half on Thursday, leaving the other half for today.   Divers had pugt a sling around one end of the barge last weekand crews moved the vessel into shallow water beside the shippingchannel, where it limited traffic to one-way, tug-assisted shipsand two-way, slow-moving barges.   The Coast Guard said that the cleanup has cost more than $1million and that the total might be about $3 million.   ``Almost all the visible oil has been recovered,'' McCullor said.</TEXT></DOC>
