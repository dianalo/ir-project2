Not necessarily. According to a USAir rule, the airline may cancel your reservation if you don't check in at the boarding gate. This applies, the rule states flatly, &quot;even if the passenger has already checked in for the flight at a location designated for check-in.&quot;    Airlines have hundreds of passenger rules, all buried in thick rule books that people rarely see. Some can work to a traveler's advantage: A few carriers, for instance, will refund even non-refundable tickets to passengers who don't want to take a delayed flight. Others are just plain strange: Alaska Airlines won't fly anyone with an &quot;offensive odor, such as from a draining wound or improper hygiene.&quot;    But the vast majority of airline rules are a traveler's nightmare waiting to happen. How many people know, for instance, that United Airlines won't be responsible for bags that aren't claimed 30 minutes after landing? Or that many carriers may not be liable for damaged baggage items they deem &quot;fragile,&quot; including stuffed animals?    &quot;If you get in a dispute, the airline just starts quoting rule so-and-so,&quot; says Jim Morrison, a consultant with Florida's Division of Consumer Services. &quot;It drives people crazy.&quot;    It sure riled E.A. Rehfeldt. After losing $5,000 in scuba-diving gear on a flight to the Caribbean last year, Trans World Airlines said it didn't owe him anything. Why? He had filed his claim the day after the loss -- a few hours past TWA's deadline. &quot;I was supposed to follow a rule I hadn't seen before,&quot; says Mr. Rehfeldt, a scuba-gear salesman in Burleson, Texas.    For their part, airlines say they often don't go by the book. And in fact, TWA did change its mind and partially reimbursed Mr. Rehfeldt -- after he spent 16 months fighting the carrier.    But TWA probably didn't have to give in. Essentially, passengers enter into a contract when they buy tickets. And courts generally have held that airline rules are a legitimate part of that contract.    &quot;Unless you can prove in court that the rule is really unreasonable, you're probably bound by it,&quot; says Con Hitchcock, a lawyer for the Aviation Consumer Action Project in Washington. &quot;Problem is, most people don't know the rules exist, or think they can't see them.&quot;    But they can. Upon request, airlines are legally required to provide free copies of these &quot;Conditions of Contract of Carriage.&quot; Written in legal jargon and in the tiniest of print, the documents often run 30 to 40 pages and don't make for casual reading. Still, they can be a handy comparison guide, because many policies differ among carriers.    Here's a look at the fine print:   BAGGAGE: The major airlines have more rules on baggage than on anything else, and they all have the same objective: Limit liability.    In general, carriers are required under federal law to pay up to $1,250 for lost or damaged bags. But airlines have a lot of leeway in defining what bags come under that law. According to Continental Airlines' rules, travelers must report lost or damaged bags within four hours of landing. In writing.    &quot;We want to be sure you don't break something a week later and claim we did it,&quot; says an airline spokesman. But many travelers don't realize anything is broken until they get home and unpack. In contrast, some airlines give as much as 45 days to file claims.    Airlines also aren't liable for fragile or perishable items that are poorly packed, and their rules provide more than 100 examples -- including hair dryers, cameras, polygraph machines, antlers, medicines and electric toothbrushes. &quot;We wanted to cover everything,&quot; says a spokeswoman for Pan American World Airways.    But why are stuffed animals on the list? &quot;In all honesty, I don't know,&quot; concedes Tom Ahlf, a TWA lawyer. &quot;To me, stuffed animals seem like pretty resilient creatures.&quot;    BOARDING RULES: Not just anyone can board an airliner. According to their rules, most carriers won't admit people who are barefoot, infected with a contagious disease, or so fat they're &quot;unable to sit with the seat belt fastened.&quot;    Airlines insist the rules make sense. A barefoot traveler might step on broken glass. Federal regulations require passengers to wear seat belts. And &quot;I don't know about you, but I wouldn't like to sit next to somebody with a draining wound,&quot; says a spokesman for Alaska Airlines.    But while such requirements haven't caused much controversy, boarding rules regarding the handicapped have. Many carriers limit the number of handicapped people allowed on flights because they worry about evacuation delays. But groups for the blind and disabled assail the rules as arbitrary. United, for example, allows 10 unescorted handicapped people per flight on its 747 jets; Pan Am permits only five on the same jet.    The dispute has become so intense that 20 blind people have been arrested and forceably removed from planes for violating airline rules over the past three years. In response, the Department of Transportation recently proposed new regulations to ban such limits.    OVERBOOKING: When airlines overbook flights, they're legally required to offer as much as $400 in cash to anyone forced to give up a seat. But how does an airline decide whom to bump?    The answer is right in Rule No. 245. Most carriers let children and handicapped passengers on first, and then simply bump the last people who checked in. But United gives priority to full-fare paying, first-class customers -- regardless of when they check in. &quot;People who pay more deserve more,&quot; a spokeswoman explains.    DELAYS: Buried in a category called &quot;schedule irregularity&quot; is some good news about flight delays.    Under one common rule, most airlines will put passengers on a competitor's flight if their own is delayed -- even if that means upgrading them to first class for free. Some airlines will also refund restricted tickets if a passenger simply doesn't want to fly because of the delay. And some do this even if the delay is only about an hour and is weather-related.    Several airlines spell out other concessions on delays -- and in amazing detail. Continental will pay for a traveler's three-minute long-distance call or one 15-word telegram if a flight is four hours behind schedule and the delay isn't weather-related. &quot;At the passenger's request,&quot; the rule goes on to say, &quot;not more than two alcoholic beverages will be provided in lieu of a meal.&quot;    Such extras &quot;are a pretty good deal,&quot; says Dan Smith, consumer affairs director for the International Airline Passengers Association. &quot;Too bad most people don't take advantage of them.&quot;    That's because airlines don't normally volunteer these freebies. Airlines say their employees can't be expected to remember all their rules and that consumers have some obligation to learn them. &quot;You can't tell everybody everything,&quot; says Carl Crumley, Piedmont Airlines' director of passenger service. &quot;You make the rules available and hope people look at them.&quot;    MISSED CONNECTIONS: If you're bound for Denver but get stuck in Detroit for the night because of a missed connection, don't expect the airline to help.    Airlines always used to promise in their rules to put up stranded passengers who miss scheduled connections. But Delta is the only major carrier that does so now. Other airlines insist they will also provide lodging on some occasions, but they're not required to.    RESERVATIONS: Travelers can reserve a specific seat a full month in advance. But that doesn't guarantee they will get on the plane.    Airlines reserve the right to cancel the reservation of anyone who doesn't check in at least 10 minutes before takeoff. And that's not the only deadline: Pan Am passengers who buy tickets at the airport must do so an hour before the scheduled departure, or the airline can cancel their reservation. And American requires anyone with a reserved seat to check in at least 30 minutes early -- or risk losing that seat.    Airlines say they only enforce these deadlines in rare cases when planes are full and standby passengers are waiting. But even seasoned travelers get tripped up by the rules.    Roger Albright, for example, recalls racing through the Dallas-Fort Worth airport to make a flight on American. He got there only a few minutes before takeoff but assumed his boarding pass guaranteed him a seat. It didn't -- and American promptly bumped him off a full flight.    &quot;They kept citing some rule I never heard of,&quot; he says. &quot;As a lawyer, I tell people to read the fine print, but this is ridiculous.&quot;    LOST TICKETS: Getting a refund for a lost ticket can be a costly undertaking. Airlines charge $25 to $50 to refund lost tickets, and they will only do it if the ticket hasn't been used by someone else.    The process is particularly painful at Continental; it will only provide refunds in the form of travel vouchers, and it takes four months to get them. &quot;We consider tickets to be cash,&quot; says Dan Morgan, the carrier's manager of passenger services, adding that the airline could be stingier. &quot;It would probably be in our means to just say, 'Sorry,'&quot; he says.    PETS: There's a slight chance of getting an odd seatmate on your next flight: a German shepherd.    Generally, airlines don't allow pets, unless they're small and caged, to ride in the cabin. Seeing-eye dogs can fly in the cabin with their owners, although airlines are quick to point out the dogs &quot;will not be permitted to occupy a seat.&quot;    But TWA allows police dogs trained in explosive detection to ride in seats -- at half fare. Still, says Mr. Ahlf of TWA, &quot;I can't imagine a dog wanting to sit in a seat with a seat belt.&quot;    ---                     Baggage Rules   Airlines say in their rules they may not be liable for damaged bags if the traveler doesn't report the problem within a certain period. Here are the deadlines for each carrier:    Pan Am                    45 days    Continental               4 hours    TWA                       One day    Delta                     21 days    United                    One day*    Northwest                 4 hours    Piedmont                  45 days    American                  None described    USAir                     45 days    Eastern                   7 days   *United also requires passengers to pick up luggage within 30 minutes after arrival   Source: Airlines' Conditions of Contract for domestic trips</TEXT></DOC>
