(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov.-elect L. Douglas Wilder has takendescriptions of his ``razor-thin'' victory margin at face value,shaving off his mustache while he waits for official vote totals tobe released Monday.   The Democrat, vying to become the nation's first elected blackgovernor, went ahead and fulfilled a promise to a reporter that hewould shave off the mustache if he beat Republican J. MarshallColeman.   The lieutenant governor first appeared in public last weekwithout the mustache he has worn since his state Senate days in the1970s, prompting a flurry of inquiries.   ``It's amazing how much attention it has garnered,'' said LauraDillard, Wilder's press secretary. ``But hey, I'd rather talk aboutthat than some other subjects.''   On Monday, the State Board of Elections will certify the resultsof the balloting for which unofficial tallies showed Wilderdefeating Coleman by fewer than 6,800 votes, at 897,025 for Wilderand 890,273 for Coleman.   State certification is made after all cities and counties havechecked their Nov. 7 election results and reported the figures tothe board, which also checks the results against registered voterlists.   Coleman, a former state attorney general, has said he may seek arecount if the official margin is less than a half-percent of the1.78 million ballots cast, or about 9,000 votes. He has 10 daysfrom the certification to make the recount request.   If the unofficial count is correct, ``we're well within thatmargin,'' said Mike Salster, a spokesman for the state RepublicanParty.   ``We're proceeding with the assumption that a recount will becalled for,'' Salster said.   It was the closest race for governor in state history, and thereis no precedent for a statewide recount, said Susan Fitz-Hugh,secretary of the board of elections.   Mrs. Fitz-Hugh has declined to estimate the length of time orcost of a recount, which would be overseen by a panel of threejudges.   Wilder has steered clear of comments on whether Coleman shouldaccept the certified vote or would be justified in seeking arecount.   ``We've said all along the ball is in the loser's court,'' Ms.Dillard said.   Wilder has appointed a transition team director and taken othersteps toward preparing to become Virginia's third straightDemocratic governor on Jan. 13.   He also has dismissed suggestions that his victory showed racismamong voters.   Pre-election and exit polls showed Wilder winning by as much as10 percent. His running mates, Donald S. Beyer Jr. for lieutenantgovernor and Mary Sue Terry for re-election as attorney general,won by comfortable margins of 54 percent and 63 percent,respectively.   Wilder, a former state senator from Richmond, was electedlieutenant governor in 1985 with almost 52 percent of the vote.</TEXT></DOC>
