Gulf Canada said it hopes to sell the unit for about C$200 million, which will be used to reduce debt. The Calgary, Alberta, company retained Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. to seek a buyer for the Denver-based unit.    Gulf Canada said Home Petroleum doesn't fit with its international business strategy of developing less mature petroleum assets in such places as Southeast Asia, North Africa and the North Sea. At the end of 1988, Home Petroleum had gross proved reserves of 11 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 106 billion cubic feet of natural gas, Gulf Canada said.    Gulf Canada is an oil and gas exploration and production company controlled by Olympia andamp; York Developments Ltd., a real estate concern owned by the Reichmann family. </TEXT></DOC>
