The two opposing groups are locked in a legal battle thathas financially imperiled Operation Rescue, an organizationof anti-abortion activists who direct their efforts atabortion clinics.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We're making every effort to hit them in the pocketbook,&quot;says Patricia Ireland, NOW's executive vice president. &quot;Weknow ourselves that it's hard to organize when you don't havemoney.&quot;   NOW's use of RICO against Operation Rescue in largemeasure has crippled fund-raising efforts and has forced thegroup to lay off 20 of its 23 paid staff members, to move outof its offices in Binghamton, N.Y., into smaller quarters andto curtail activities substantially. During a two-day periodlast week Operation Rescue raised only $200 in contributions.   &quot;People have nowhere to send their money without fear thegovernment will seize the money, and so they don't send it,&quot;says Robert Jewitt, Operation Rescue's national mediacoordinator. &quot;A lot of the activities that we planned can'tgo on.&quot;   The legal activity is rekindling controversy about the1970 RICO law, which was aimed at organized crime but whichhas been extended into business cases. NOW argues thatOperation Rescue members are acting like racketeers, tryingto frighten pregnant women and health workers away fromabortion clinics.   &quot;There's a lot of questions whether this law was designedfor this sort of thing,&quot; says John Decker of the DePaulUniversity College of Law. &quot;Congress had in mind puttingtogether an instrument to use against conventional organizedcrime -- the mob. This is clearly a very creative and veryunconventional use of legislation that wasn't designed forpolitical use.&quot;   In the legal battle, Operation Rescue has been fined$150,000 in New York, and other anti-abortion groups havebeen fined $350,000 in the state. In another setback forOperation Rescue, the Supreme Court yesterday let stand afederal judge's order, based on a NOW suit citing CivilWar-era laws, that forbids the group's members from blockingwomen trying to enter New York-area abortion clinics.   &quot;They have made it very difficult for us,&quot; Randall Terry,Operation Rescue's founder, says of the NOW suits. &quot;But theycannot understand that we have authority and power even if wedon't have money. We have moral absolutes we're willing tofight by and die by if necessary, and we have courage.&quot;   Last week, a day after the Supreme Court declined to lifta state court injunction keeping protesters away from clinicsin Georgia, five Operation Rescue members bound themselvestogether with bicycle locks inside the Atlanta Surgicenter.   Some believe the struggle between NOW and Operation Rescuerepresents a deep cultural dispute. &quot;These are two groupsthat live in fundamentally different worlds and hardly everencounter each other,&quot; says Faye Ginsburg, an anthropologistat New York University who has studied both the women'smovement and the evangelical movement. &quot;One group seesabortion as a symbol of the decadence of the world. The othersees abortion as fundamental to women being able to achieveopportunity and to control their lives.&quot;   Mr. Terry describes NOW as &quot;a radical fringe group with avery liberal socialist agenda.&quot; He adds: &quot;We believe in Godand the precious sanctity of each human life and they believein a sordid, base lifestyle that includes the murder of theiroffspring.&quot;   Molly Yard, the leader of NOW, says that Mr. Terry'sforces are &quot;instructing their children to bite our people onthe legs and forming flying wedges.&quot; She has urged members ofNOW to increase their vigilance at abortion clinics.   &quot;They have every right to picket and say what theybelieve, but they have no right to close down a legitimatebusiness,&quot; Ms. Yard says. &quot;We won't fight them physically,but we will be at the clinics to keep them open.&quot;   NOW says use of the RICO law is appropriate becauseOperation Rescue is engaged in extortion, the use of force orthreats of force to deprive others of a valuable right.Operation Rescue leaders deny the charges.   &quot;The traditional use of this {law} is in cases wheresomeone is deprived of a property right, like in blackmail,&quot;says Ms. Ireland, NOW's legal strategist. &quot;But the thing ofvalue can be an intangible right, like the right to obtainmedical services at an abortion clinic, or the right of aclinic to do business.&quot;   Several judges have agreed with her, and NOW has woncontempt-of-court judgments stemming from its racketeeringand other suits. In Congress, the House Judiciary Committeeis working on an overhaul of RICO that would restrict thereach of the statute, but discussions have reached animpasse.   Some legal experts say they are uneasy with how broadlyRICO has been applied, particularly in cases involvingabortion protesters. &quot;Whatever you can say about thesedemonstrators, they're not racketeers,&quot; says Alan Dershowitzof the Harvard Law School. &quot;They're not doing it for afinancial motive. The idea that you can terrorize protesterswith the threat of bankruptcy is an attack on democracy.&quot;   G. Robert Blakey, the Notre Dame Law School professor whodrafted RICO, argues the law has broad legitimateapplication. &quot;The statute applies to anyone -- with a whitecollar, a blue collar or no collar at all,&quot; he says. &quot;It'snot for mobsters only.&quot;   But Mr. Blakey believes RICO is being used not tovindicate the rights of clinics as much as to chill therights of demonstrators. &quot;Unfortunately, RICO is being usedas a political tool and people are being brought in not fordoing something unlawful on the picket line but because theyhave a certain viewpoint,&quot; he says. &quot;These two sides in thisdeath struggle have grabbed this statute and are pulling itdown with them.&quot;   Rep. Rick Boucher (D., Va.), a principal figure in thecongressional negotiations on RICO, says, &quot;A search for theoriginal intent of this law is vain and probably not veryrelevant.&quot;   The abortion-rights movement hasn't prevailed in all itsbattles against anti-abortion activists. The American LifeLeague defeated a RICO suit by Planned Parenthood, NOW andothers in Pennsylvania when it argued that neither the leaguenor Judie Brown, the group's president, was at a 1988 protestin Philadelphia.   Joseph Scheidler, president of the Pro Life Action League,an ally of Operation Rescue, has filed a $5 milliondefamation-of-character suit against NOW, Ms. Yard and Ms.Ireland. &quot;This is a grudge battle,&quot; says Mr. Scheidler, whosays his battles with NOW and others have cost him $90,000 inlegal fees. &quot;It's their ideology against ours. We're notgoing to give up and they're not going to give up.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
