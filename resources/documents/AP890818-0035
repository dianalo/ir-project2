The FAA on Thursday said a shipment of chemicals by TextileTreatments International of Austin resulted in a cargo-hold firethat forced the pilot to order an emergency evacuation when theplane landed in Nashville, Tenn. Several passengers and flight crewmembers were injured.   ``We consider this a very serious incident,'' said FAA spokesmanJohn Leyden. ``This is the largest fine we've ever asked for in ahazardous materials case.''   Hugh Lowe, an attorney representing the company, said it wouldcontest the proposed fines.   Leyden said the company's options include paying the fine orasking for a hearing before an administrative law judge at theDepartment of Transportation. Should the company refuse to pay,government attorneys could file suit in federal court.

Included was five gallons of a hydrogenperoxide solution banned from passenger and cargo-only flights.</TEXT><NOTE>EPA Accused of Contributing to Air Pollution</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An environmental group has accused theEnvironmental Protection Agency of contributing to increased airpollution by promoting the burning of toxic wastes.   The National Toxics Campaign Fund, a private organization thatfocuses on toxic pollution issues, said at a news conference outsidethe agency's headquarters Thursday that EPA's policies will``encourage more toxic waste production.''   The EPA issued a statement saying the group ``seriouslydistorts'' the agency's role in the disposal of such wastes.   ``The only thing we're prompting is waste reduction,'' said EPAspokeswoman Robin Woods. ``We're encouraging (states) to considerall waste reduction opportunities. Secondly we're looking at them tolook at existing (disposal) facilities out of state. And as a lastresort build new facilities.''   She said that the EPA requires strict emission controls whentoxic wastes are burned.   The environmental group said the EPA does not focus enough ingetting companies and industrial plants to invest in technology thatwould reduce toxic emissions.   Instead, the critics maintained, agency policy requires state andlocal officials to develop new toxic disposal facilities such asadditional landfills or incinerators.</TEXT></DOC>
