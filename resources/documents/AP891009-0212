Inc. on Monday reported a 9.9percent decline in third-quarter profit, reflecting continuedweakness in financial advertising in its publications and a drop innet income at a key affiliate.   The business publishing company said its profit fell to $28.8million, or 29 cents a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30from $32 million, or 33 cents a share, in the same period a yearearlier.   The decline occurred despite a 5.3 percent increase in revenueto $404.1 million from $383.7 million in the third quarter of 1988.   Dow Jones attributed the profit decline partly to continuedweakness in advertising at its flagship publication The Wall StreetJournal and its weekly financial newspaper, Barron's. In addition,the company said, its bottom line was hurt by a 17.6 percent dropin net income at Telerate Inc., an electronic financial dataservice that is 67 percent owned by Dow Jones.   Profits at Telerate, like Dow Jones a publicly traded company,tumbled to $19.5 million, or 21 cents a share, from $23.6 million,or 25 cents a share, in the third quarter of 1988. Most of the losscame from startup costs for its new foreign-exchange tradingservice.   Separately Monday, Telerate said it is in negotiations to buythe 50 percent stake that its partner American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. owns in the joint venture Global TransactionsServices Co. Telerate and ATandamp;T began the venture in 1987 to developan electronic service for foreign-exchange transactions.   Telerate is expected to reply on Tuesday to an $18-a-share, or$576 million, offer from Dow Jones for the remainder of Teleratethat it doesn't already own. The offer, announced last month,values the entire company at nearly $1.71 billion.   Dow Jones' net income for the first nine months of the yearjumped 49.7 percent to $277.2 million, or $2.75 a share, from$185.1 million, or $1.92 a share, in the year-earlier period. Thelatest nine-month period included an after-tax gain of $164.1million, or $1.63 a share, from the sale in January of Dow Jones'interest in Continental Cablevision Inc.   In the first nine months of 1988, Dow Jones had an after-taxgain of $68 million, or 71 cents a share, mainly from the sale ofits book-publishing subsidiary.   Revenue for the first three quarters rose 4.9 percent to $1.25billion from $1.19 billion a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
