Consequently, states are required to develop plans whichprovide for attainment and maintenance of these new standards.

These particles are referred to as ``PM<T2>10</T2>.'' The PM<T2>10</T2> standard covers a size range of particles different than therange of particles covered by the former particulate standard, total suspendedparticulate (TSP). This means the states have to develop and implementPM<T2>10</T2> control programs. This process will follow the basic approachused in the development and implementation of TSP control programs. First,the air quality across the state is examined and areas where improvementis needed are delineated. Then, the degree of improvement needed is determined.Next, the sources contributing to the problem are inventoried and a strategyis developed to reduce emissions from those sources to bring about attainmentof the NAAQS. Finally the strategy is implemented and steps are taken toensure that the NAAQS will not be violated.EPA, in conjunction with the states, have completed the first two stepsin the development and implementation of control programs. Areas have beencategorized into three groups. They are:<ITAG tagnum="15">Group I_Areas for which the existing particulate matter SIP may needsubstantial revision to be adequate for attaining and maintaining PM</ITAG><T2>10</T2> standards.<ITAG tagnum="15">Group II_Areas for which the existing particulate matter SIP may beadequate or need only minor adjustment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Group III_Areas for which the existing particulate matter SIP's arebelieved adequate to attain and maintain the PM</ITAG><T2>10</T2> standards.EPA evaluated the probabilities of PM<T2>10</T2> air quality levels predicted from actual TSP data and concludedthat South Carolina is a Group III area; therefore, the South CarolinaState Implementation Plan had to be revised to address the PM<T2>10</T2> NAAQS in the following ways:a. To include State ambient air quality standards for PM<T2>10</T2> at least as stringent as the NAAQS;b. To trigger preconstruction review for new or modified sources whichwould emit significant amounts of either PM or PM<T2>10</T2> emissions;c. To invoke the emergency episode plan to prevent PM<T2>10</T2> concentrations from reaching the significant harm level of600 mg/m3;d. To meet ambient PM<T2>10</T2> monitoring requirements of 40 CFR Part 58; ande. To meet the requirements of 40 CFR 51.322 and 51.323 to report actualannual emissions of PM<T2>10</T2> (beginning with emissions for 1988) for point sources emitting100 tons per year or more.On April 29, 1988, the State of South Carolina submitted to EPA severalrevisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP). Subsequent to the April29 submittal, by letters of June 16 and August 1, 1988, EPA noted deficienciesin the revision. As a result of the noted deficiencies, the State's rulemakingprocess was reinitiated, culminating in a public hearing on November 28,1988. All of EPA's comments and revisions are reflected in the followingregulations which South Carolina resubmitted on April 4, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="25">Regulation 62.1, Definitions, Permit Requirements, and Emissions Inventory</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Regulation 62.3, Air Pollution Episodes</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 1_Emissions from Fuel Burning Operations</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 2_Ambient Air Quality Standards</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 4_Emissions from Process Industries</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 6_Alternative Emission Limitation Options</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 7_Prevention of Significant Deterioration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">SIP Narrative Section 8_New Source Review and Source Permit Systemand Offset Policy</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">SIP Amendments</ITAG>Regulation 62.1, Definitions, Permit Requirements, and Emissions Inventory,was revised to include definitions of ``PM<T2>10</T2>,'' ``particulate emissions,'' and ``particulate matter emissions.''The definition of ``suspended particulate'' was amended to ``total suspendedparticulate.'' The regulation also revised references to ``particulate''and includes permit conditions presently stated in the State's PollutionControl Act. EPA currently has no regulations or guidance which specifythe requirements for an approvable operating permit program and consequentlydoes not recognize such operating permit programs as part of a SIP. Regulation62.1, section II was previously revised in a June 5, 1985, submittal. EPAhas deferred action on the June 5, 1985, revision and is deferring actionon this revision. EPA is planning on proposing operating permit regulationsin the near future as a result of the Chemical Manufacturers Associationrulemaking pursuant to the out of court settlement. If and when EPA promulgatesthe operating permit regulations, EPA will take action to approve or disapprovethe revisions to section II at that time.Regulation 62.3, Air Pollution Episodes, is revised by adding PM<T2>10</T2> Watch, Alert, and Emergency levels. It specifies the conditionsjustifying the proclamation of an air pollution episode. The revision deleteslevels for ``Particulate,'' ``SO<T2>2</T2> and Particulate combined,'' and revises references to ``Particulate.''Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 1, Emissions from Fuel Burning Operations,is revised in its references to ``Particulate.''Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 2, Ambient Air Quality Standards, is revisedto incorporate the PM<T2>10</T2> ambient air quality standards, to revise the ``suspended particulates''standard, and to include methods used to determine attainment of the PM<T2>10</T2> standard which are the same as the standards and methods inthe July 1, 1987, <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice.Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 4, Emissions from Process Industries, isamended to revise references to ``Particulate.''Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 6, Alternative Emission Limitation Options,was amended to revise references to ``Particulate.'' The state submitteda revision to 62.5, Standard No. 6, on June 5, 1985. EPA is evaluatingthis regulation, as revised in both submittals for agreement with the newEmissions Trading Policy published on December 4, 1986 (51 FR 43814). EPAwill act on both revisions to Standard No. 6 at the same time.Regulation No. 62.5, Standard No. 7 is revised to add clarifying referencesto ``particulate matter'' and ``governing standard,'' to delete the ``24-hour''averaging time reference, to add a requirement for EPA's concurrence, tochange the referenced standard from federal to State, to replace ``particulatematter'' in the Class I variance table with ``TSP,'' to add PM<T2>10</T2> emission rates, to add a ``Grandfather rule,'' to add a PM<T2>10</T2> impact level, to add PM<T2>10</T2> monitoring transition requirements, and to include allowableincreases of PM<T2>10</T2>.In addition to the revisions to the Regulations and Standards, clarifyinglanguage was added to the narrative portion of the South Carolina Air QualityImplementation Plan to maintain consistency with the regulatory and federalrequirements. The narrative portion includes section 8, New Source Reviewand Source Permit System, and the offset policy. EPA will approve theserevisions in a separate notice.In order to complete South Carolina's PM<T2>10</T2> SIP submittal, the Bureau of Air Quality Control submitteda list of the regulations relied upon to maintain the PM<T2>10</T2> National Ambient Air Quality Standards along with the corresponding<T4>Federal Register</T4> approval dates.<T3>Final Action.</T3> EPA has reviewed the submitted material and foundit to meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 51. Therefore, EPA approvesthe South Carolina PM<T2>10</T2> revisions. However, the revisions for the nonattainment newsource review and source permit system, and offset policy will be dealtwith in a forthcoming notice.This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes arenoncontroversial and EPA anticipates no significant comments on them. Thepublic should be advised that this action will be effective 60 days fromdate of this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. However, if notice is received within30 days that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments, thisaction will be withdrawn and two subsequent notices will be published beforethe effective date. One notice will withdraw the final action and anotherwill begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action andestablishing a comment period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that these revisions will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709.)This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administratorunder the procedures published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225).
