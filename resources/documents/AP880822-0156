Chun Kyung-hwan, 46, is accused of taking 7.6 billion won ($10.5million) in embezzlement, extortion and bribes while head of theSaemaul Movement, a semi-official community development project.   At the closing session Monday, senior prosecutor Lee Myung-jaesaid the younger Chun deserved a heavy penalty for amassing anillegal fortune by using Saemaul projects as cover. The SaemaulMovement, once heavily subsidized by Chun Doo-hwan's government,oversaw development projects in both urban and rural areas.   Lee said the defendant showed no remorse and refused to admitmost of the alleged wrongdoing despite the evidence and testimonyfrom witnesses. He was arrested soon after his brother left thepresidency in February at the end of a seven-year term.   Court officials said a verdict and sentencing in the case areexpected Sept. 5.   It was the first prosecution of a corruption case arising fromthe Chun administration. But the National Assembly, in which thegovernment party has lost its majority, has set up a specialcommittee to investigate alleged irregularities involving theformer president and his family.   The prosecution also demanded prison terms ranging from one toseven years for 11 other defendants, most of them former Saemaulofficials, who are charged with embezzlement, breach of trust, taxevasion and other offenses.   In his final statement to the court, Chun Kyung-hwan asked forleniency because of his efforts on behalf of the Saemaul Movement.</TEXT></DOC>
