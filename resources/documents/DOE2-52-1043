The discussions are essentiallyconfined to those systems in which optimisation is equivalent to symmetricalconfigurations of the measurement systems. They include, measurementsof interaction cross section of diverse types, determination of polarisations,development of detectors with almost ideal characteristics, productionof radiations with continuously variable energies and development ofhigh efficiency spectrometers etc. The monograph is intended for useby experimental physicists investigating primary interactions of radiationswith matter and associated technologies. We have illustrated the variousoptimisation procedures by considering the cases of the so-called ''14MeV'' on d-t neutrons and gamma rays with energies less than 3 MeV. Developmentsin fusion technology are critically dependent on the availability accuratecross sections of nuclei for fast neutrons of energies at least as highas d-t neutrons. In this monograph we have discussed various techniqueswhich can be used to improve the accuracy of such measurements and havealso presented a method for generating almost monoenergetic neutronsin the 8 MeV to 13 MeV energy range which can be used to measure crosssections in this sparingly investigated region.</TEXT></DOC>
