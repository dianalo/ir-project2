Monday reported that revenues for the third quarterended Sept. 30, 1990, totaled $104.1 million, up 24 percent from $83.7million in the previous year's third quarter.andM;Earnings and earnings per share for the third quarter of 1990 were $9.7million and $0.47, respectively, compared to $8.4 million and $0.40 for theprevious year's third quarter.andM;Revenues for the first nine months ended Sept. 30, 1990 were $285.3 million,17 percent higher than the $243.2 million Stratus reported for the first ninemonths of 1989.andP;  Earnings and earnings per share for the period were $23.5million and $1.13, respectively, compared to $25.2 million and $1.21 for thesame period a year ago.andM;&quot;We are very encouraged by this quarter's results,&quot; said William E. Foster,president and chief executive officer of Stratus.andP;  &quot;Business from all ourmajor sales channels was good.andP;  Direct business was up 36 percent over thesame period last year.andP;  Direct domestic business was up 19 percent whiledirect international was up 58 percent.andP;  Sales through our OEM relationshipwith IBM were about flat compared to last year, and sales from ourinternational distributors were very strong, up 65 percent over last year.andM;&quot;We continue to focus our business on the critical online computing market,where our products have significant differentiation and advantages over ourcompetitors.andP;  Our niche, which we have always focused on, continues to growin all industries and all corners of the world.andP;  After a decade of explosivegrowth throughout the computer industry, expansion will now be moreselective.andP;  And our segment of the business, critical online computing, isone of the few places where there is growth.andM;&quot;This quarter's strong results indicate how the marketplace has received ournew XA2000 product line, which we introduced earlier this year.andP;  Our existingcustomer base is upgrading to our new generation of processors, and newcustomers across the globe have chosen Stratus for its special onlineperformance and assured, around-the-clock uptime.andM;&quot;New, exciting applications are going online across all industries becausethe way to do business in the nineties is online.andP;  We see continual growth inour traditional financial services markets, and growth in the newer coremarkets: telecommunications, retail, travel, manufacturing, and others.andM;&quot;Stratus continues to build its alternate distribution channels to prepare afoundation for long-term success.andP;  This quarter's most dramatic example ofour business strategy was our signing of an OEM agreement with NECCorporation.andP;  NEC, along with other relationships we are building, willtarget the telecommunications industry.andP;  This is one of the most excitinggrowth areas in critical online computing.andP;  In telecommunications, as inother industries we address, a host of online services are in demand forbusiness and consumers in the nineties.andM;&quot;By managing our company well -- by remaining focused on what we do best andby expanding our channels, industry markets, and applications -- we areinvesting in the long term viability of Stratus.&quot;andM;COMPANY REORG POSITIONS STRATUS FOR MARKET, REGIONAL FOCUS Stratus alsoannounced a restructuring into four business divisions:andM;Telecommunications, North American, International, and Corporate Operations.andM;The move signals the company's sharpened focus on high growth industrymarkets, such as telecommunications, and greater flexibility to more quicklyand strategically respond to the unique vertical market needs of differentgeographic areas.andM;Said Foster, &quot;The reorganization is something I have contemplated for severalyears, and it will mean more effective decision-making and better applicationof resources to where business opportunities are.andP;  Our independent businessunits can now make more strategic decisions about vertical markets and howpeople and programs should be applied to them.andP;  I expect this move to bringus closer to the marketplace -- so that our technical expertise can bematched by our growing knowledge of what is happening in important marketssuch as telecommunications.andM;&quot;One example of our commitment is the move of Bob Freiburghouse, one of ourco-founders, from Senior Vice President of Engineering and Marketing to thegeneral manager's position in the Telecommunications Division.andP;  With thiskind of commitment and talent, we are truly positioned for continued successin the 1990s,&quot; concluded Foster.andM;Other heads of the new divisions include:andM;Gary Haroian, former senior vice president, Finance and Administration andchief financial officer, who now is general manager of Corporate Operations;andM;Paul Tucker, former senior vice president of International Sales and Service,who now is general manager of the International Operations Division.andM;Richard Tarulli, former vice president of Eastern Operations, Sales, who nowis general manager of the North American Operations Division.andM;The company's new chief financial officer is Robert Donahue, formerly thevice president of finance, corporate controller.andM;General managers will report directly to Bill Foster, and the new chieffinancial officer will report to Gary Haroian.andM;One of the fastest-growing companies in the industry, Stratus reportedrevenues of $341.3 million for fiscal year 1989, up 29 percent from $265.3million in 1988.andM;The company, whose headquarters are in Marlboro, Mass., has twelveinternational subsidiaries.andM;Stratus Computer Inc.andM;Consolidated Statement of IncomeandM;(in thousands, except per share amounts)andM;Third Quarter Ended    Nine Months EndedandM;9/30/90  10/1/89        9/30/90  10/1/89andM;Net sales                 $104,081   $83,693     $285,317  $243,188andM;Cost of sales               43,515    32,636      118,252    95,433andM;Gross profit                60,566    51,057      167,065   147,755andM;Operating expensesandM;Research and development   15,297    11,888       42,147    33,027andM;Selling, general andandM;administrative             32,634    26,331       92,961    76,590andM;Total                    47,931    38,219      135,108   109,617andM;Income from operations      12,635    12,838       31,957    38,138andM;Other income                  345       342          720     1,220andM;Income before provisionandM;for income taxes           12,980    13,180       32,667    39,358andM;Provision for incomeandM;taxes                       3,245     4,745        9,154    14,166andM;Net income                   9,735     8,435       23,523    25,192andM;Weighted average sharesandM;of common stock andandM;common stock equivalentsandM;oustanding                 20,862    20,931       20,852    20,786andM;Net income per commonandM;share                    $   0.47  $   0.40     $   1.13  $   1.21</TEXT></DOC>
