The new research operation was announced Tuesday by theAgriculture Department as a way to help find natural enemies ofinsects and weeds that threaten crops in the two countries.   Ultimately, the exchange of ``biocontrol'' organisms andscientific information could help boost crop production in bothChina and the United States.   Orville G. Bentley, assistant secretary for science andeducation, said the new Sino-American Biological ControlCollaborative Laboratory is located at the Chinese Academy ofAgricultural Sciences.   Under a five-year agreement with the academy, three USDAscientists will go to the laboratory next May and conduct researchthere for six months each year. They will work in the United Statesthe remaining six months of the year.   Richard S. Soper, biocontrol research leader in the department'sAgricultural Research Service, said the Beijing laboratory will be aquarantine and research facility for exchanging potential biocontrolorganisms between the two countries.   The targeted U.S. pests include: leafy spurge, a noxiousrangeland weed; two water weeds, hydrilla and watermilfoil; and theRussian wheat aphid. Soper said the aphid is ``the most worrisomepest.'' It was first spotted in the United States in 1986 and hasspread rapidly to wheat-growing areas.   Pests of concern to China are: croftonweed, a weed so toxic tohorses that they can't be kept on certain land; scale insects; andapple leaf mites.   Next year the Chinese academy is expected to send scientists toUSDA laboratories in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and Buenos Aires,Argentina.   Soper said scientists at four agency laboratories in France,Italy, South Korea and Argentina are searching overseas to findbiocontrols for U.S. pests. But until now, he said, scientists havenot been able to easily explore most of the vast Eurasian land area.   ``The new lab takes care of much of Asia that we've missed, andwe're hoping we can develop similar arrangements with the Soviets,''he said.   Meanwhile, the USDA also announced that private exporters havesold China an additional 400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat atsubsidized prices for shipment in January and February.   The sales, equal to about 14.7 million bushels, were handled byfour companies: Cargill Inc., 190,000 tons; Central StatesEnterprises Inc., 40,000; Richco Grain Ltd., 40,000; and FerruzziUSDA Inc., 130,000.   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department'sForeign Agricultural Service, said the sales were part of anauthorized 1 million tons of wheat announced on Dec. 7 under theExport Enhancement Program, or EEP. About 10,000 tons also remainedof an earlier EEP authorization.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Agriculture Department has granted 13states a total of $2.9 million to help finance mediation effortsbetween financially strapped farmers and their creditors.   La Verne Ausman, acting administrator of the Farmers HomeAdministration, said Tuesday the funds _ to be matched by the states_ will be used to ``resolve differences between other lenders andfarmers'' who have loans from the USDA agency.   The money, he said, ``will help make it possible for a neutral,third party mediator to cast a fresh eye on the problem. Manydisputes are resolved in this manner.''   For example, the FmHA and other lenders might agree to writedown, or reduce, a borrower's debt or in some other way worktogether to help the farmer meet his obligations.   The matching grants were authorized in the Agricultural CreditAct passed by Congress last year.   States qualifying for the FmHA grants in the fiscal year thatbegan Oct. 1 are: Alabama, $110,208; Iowa, $305,000; Kansas,$431,150; Minnesota, $500,000; Mississippi, $75,040; Montana,$75,000; Nebraska, $168,140; North Dakota, $250,000; Oklahoma,$269,870; South Dakota, $97,000; Texas, $500,000; Wisconsin,$87,440; and Wyoming, $25,000.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The final $90 million in this year's budget fora program to help promote U.S. farm exports has been allocated bythe Agriculture Department.   Under the Targeted Export Assistance program, or TEA as it iscalled, various trade organizations get government funds to carryout overseas promotion of designated agricultural products.   In most cases, the sponsoring organizations put up some of theirown funds in carrying out a specific project, although the amountsof those contributions vary and are subject to negotiation with thedepartment.   The level of TEA spending was set by the 1985 farm law at $110million annually through fiscal 1988 and at $325 million in each ofthe following two years. However, the USDA's appropriation act for1989 reduced the level to $200 million.   An initial allocation of $110 million was announced on Aug. 17,and the $90 million announced Tuesday completes the program fundingfor the 1989 fiscal year that began Oct. 1.   The largest amount, $8.2 million, was reserved for applicants topromote the overseas sales of almonds, followed by $8.1 million forthe U.S. Meat Export Federation. Other leading recipients include:Cotton Council International, $7.1 million; American PlywoodAssociation, $5.9 million; and National Forest Products Association,$4.85 million.</TEXT></DOC>
