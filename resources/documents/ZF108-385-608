 Thesecomponents of the network architecture influence the network'sefficiency and speed.andP;  The workstations should be upgraded to atleast AT level microcomputers.andP;  Slow workstations hold up networkuse by accessing files and processing data slowly.andP;  Slow buses inslow workstations make this situation even worse, so the bus speedshould be as fast as the other components will tolerate.andP;  Fileservers should be improved according to the network operatingsystem vendor's recommendation regarding the amount of DRAM.andP;  Analternative to upgrading or reconfiguring the LAN fileserver/microcomputer is to purchase one of the new heavy duty fileservers designed for the purpose.andP;  Other LAN hardware issues arecabling and support.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Hardware SelectionCommunications Boards-CardsLocal Area NetworksNetwork ArchitectureFile Servers.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Network Performance: In the NIC of Time Improving network performance is aninexact science--the true number of variables involved would choke manycompilers.andP;  Chaos theory often seems to rule network responsiveness, butthere are ways to design in or increase network performance without undulyshrinking your wallet--and still get predictable results.andM;The measuring stick for network performance boils down to the user'sperception of speed (how long it takes to get something done).andP;  Response timeis measured subjectively; &quot;it took about 30 seconds to do this query&quot; or&quot;Wow--was that fast!&quot;andP;  If performance is up to par, you'll never hear usersgripe.andP;  But your customers will get testy when an account query takes foreverto show.andP;  The network experts rate performance in several ways: burst I/O, orthe networks best capacity to deliver raw I/O; read/write speed measured inkilobytes/second, through timed applications or application emulation tests;or the effects of added workstation activity on a network.andM;No two networks are alike in performance characteristics--each has adifferent architecture.andP;  Networks vary in network operating system type;protocol type; number, type, and speed of its workstations; number, type, andrevision of the applications; data size handled by the application;internetwork activities; file-server hardware architecture; and more.andM;A programmer or analyst's relationship with networks usually comes about inone of three ways: inheritance, reworks/upgrades, or new designs.andP;  I'llexplain each of these shortly.andP;  Each relationship strongly influences priceand performance considerations in a different way.andP;  The scope of this articleencompasses the PC world, but the techniques suggested apply to all possiblemembers in a network.andM;InheritanceandM;Inherited networks may consist of well-designed hardware and software, fastnetwork cards, and muscular workstations coupled with an older butserviceable network operating system (NOS).andP;  You may also find that none ofthis exists, or no one wanted to spend the additional investment dollarsuntil the old system fully depreciated.andP;  On the upside, most PC hardware innetworks designed after 1985 have a good chance of being upgraded and used,whether they're based on Novell's NetWare, Banyan's Vines, 3Com's 3Share, orother NOSs.andM;The first place to kick inherited network performance in the pants is toreconsider any PC- or XT-level workstation on the network, and replace themwith the fastest workstation hardware affordable.andP;  The 8088/8086 machinerysimply doesn't have a fast enough bus to let any network card deliver I/Oquickly.andP;  A network interface card (NIC) compared in an XT- and AT-levelworkstation delivers more I/O in the AT workstation, not because the AT-levelworkstation is a naturally faster machine, but because the bus speed anddesign allow the NIC to move data faster--the increase is more than just theAT's natural horsepower.andP;  Older workstations don't slow a network down, butthey do tie up files/records, indexes, and overlays while plodding throughtheir work.andM;I've found that the bus of the machine is very important.andM;An XT uses a slower system clock, an eight-bit data fetch, and two waitstates above 384K.andP;  The system clock is an amusingly slow 2MHz.andP;  You can'tsimply shove data down an XT's throat.andP;  Its mouth is too small and it gulpsslowly.andP;  But an AT (or any decent 286 clone) not only takes 16-bit gulps andprocesses faster, but its bus is at least 6MHz, (nice clones clip along at upto 20MHz with 12MHz being typical), it has no wait states upstairs (above384K in the memory map), and it has not one paltry DMA channel like the XT,but three.andP;  Nicer yet, the AT's interrupt control logic and chipsets arefaster.andP;  After equalizing out the processor performance in the usual MIP orDhrystone numbers, the bus really makes a difference.andM;Low demand or limited access usage of 8088/8086 PCs allows them to remain ona network; usually these machines go on the inheritance plan--they're givento nominal or casual users.andP;  Randomly removing a NIC from an 8088/8086workstation and placing that NIC into a faster machine may not work.andP;  Someolder NICs simply don't work in faster workstations and there's no cure forthat problem.andP;  A quick check with the NIC vendor's technical support staffwill give you an indication of potential NIC upgrades to faster hardware.andM;Hastening file serviceandM;Networks live or die by their ability to transact I/O.andP;  There are essentiallytwo kinds of relationships: one-among-many (peer-to-peer) or many-to-one(clients-server(s)).andP;  Products like DCA's 10NET use peer-to-peerrelationships to make information (hence I/O, or data) available to anapplication on a workstation--it can be both a file server and a DOS sessionconcurrently, and at will.andM;In the classic client-server relationship represented by Novell's NetWare andMicrosoft's LAN Manager, the server (whether a file, database, or other type)is required to be reactive.andP;  Servers are asked to react--because the requestsmade of them aren't periodic.andP;  Designers look to make the best response timeavailable, given the application, average and peak traffic that theapplication generates, and elbow room for growth and the addition of otherservices.andM;Peer-to-peer networks, although rarer than client-server networks, have muchof the same design technique applied to them.andP;  A database is placed in one ormore workstations to be dealt with by other workstations across the network.andM;Older networks often have file servers (built from technology of an olderera).andP;  The server componentry consists of older ST-506/412 MFM-recorded harddisks (whose I/O delivery can often be measured in bytes per fortnight) in8MHz AT-compatible PCs containing, at most, 2M of RAM.andP;  With luck, theoperating system vendor is still in business and--with even more luck--hassuccumbed to criticism and improved the speed and/or efficiency of thatoperating system by an order of magnitude or more.andM;Improving the file server platform is the second step to increasing networkperformance.andP;  The same criteria used to improve file service in inheritedsystems applies to upgrades/retro-fits and new designs.andP;  After resolving anycompatibility issues between file server hardware choices and the networkoperating system, follow the NOS vendor's recommendation when selecting theamount of DRAM to place in the file server.andP;  The NOS vendor's DRAMrecommendation is often directly proportional to the size of the hard disk oroptical media that will be used for file service.andP;  The nature of file serviceis that often 80 percent or more of the I/O activity generated in a networkare reads.andP;  Most astute NOS vendors recognize that fact and use a goodfraction of the DRAM they've recommended for cache--pulling the I/O from DRAMis plenty faster than forcing the file server to read directly from its harddisk or optical media.andM;After the performance of the file server has been improved, the third area toincrease performance is optimizing the network topology to the file serverhardware.andM;The file server platform, whether 286-, 386-, or 486-based, has a bus.andO;Whether standard ISA, newer EISA, or MicroChannel, file server bus speed hasa direct bearing on network throughput.andP;  Choose the fastest bus speed thatthe NIC, hard disk, or optical media controller and other server-associatedcomponents will tolerate.andP;  Cards that use &quot;bus master&quot; designs can furtherimprove performance (although apple-to-apple performance comparisons betweenbus master NICs and non-bus masters have been few, and generallyinconclusive).andM;The pipes that connect a workstation to a server take on three principalforms these days: Ethernet, ARCnet, and token ring.andP;  Other network protocolsare emerging around Fiber Distributed Data Interchange (FDDI) and other kindsof technologies, such as Thomas Conrad Corp.'s TCNS, a high speed fiber opticnetwork card.andP;  Each protocol form has its advantages, and each, whenconfigured poorly, can have a response time measured against the arrival of atax refund check.andP;  DOS or OS/2-based software talks to the server or peer,via a shell or driver, through the NIC.andM;NICd againandM;Bandwidth, or the theoretical capacity of a selected network protocol todeliver raw I/O, is often used as a general means of differentiating networkprotocols.andP;  IBM's token ring networks come in two speeds: four megabits persecond and 16 megabits per second.andP;  This doesn't mean the latter systeminstallation runs four times as fast as its four-megabit-per-secondcounterpart...yet.andP;  Ethernet, invented by Xerox and now manufactured by over48 companies worldwide and marketed by many more, has a bandwidth of 10megabits per second.andP;  ARCnet comes in two flavors as well: 2.6 megabits persecond and a soon-to-be-released 20 megabits per second; like token ringnetworks, a divisor in performance hasn't been found yet.andP;  None of theseprotocols is 100-percent efficient; each has overhead associated with thenature of the protocol--ARCnet has the least overhead.andM;In LAN Magazine's &quot;Network Card Drag Races,&quot; two trends in performance havebecome apparent with the NICs that run under Novell's NetWare: 1) thetheoretical bandwidth has little to do with tested throughput in DOSenvironment, and 2) NIC vendor design optimization has become very important.andO;The drivers and shells that mate workstations or file servers to the NICchange rapidly.andP;  Given their impact, they need to be checked frequently forupdates.andM;Microsoft/OEM LAN Manager performance data is scarce, and the current datawill soon be obsolete after LAN Manager version 2.0 is released.andM;Dead topologiesandM;When faced with an inherited network, one can find any number of dead networkprotocols (the manufacturer is gone or no longer supports it).andP;  Someprotocols died not because the protocol was bad, but because it wasproprietary; the rapid advancements in networking have made supportingimprovements to NICs and their drivers an expensive proposition for NICmanufacturers.andP;  Many protocols are no longer supported by the NOS vendorseither.andP;  These include famous technologies, like Novell's support for IBM'sPC Network I cards, and the lesser known, like Orchid Technology's PCnet.andM;Dead protocols can often be replaced (somewhat inexpensively) by NICs thatcan use cabling systems used by dead stuff.andP;  IMC Networks' Ethernet NICs, asan example, have a jumper that allows them to use PCnet cabling (RG58/U 75ohm coaxial cable, if singlewire drops weren't used) or Wang/ARCnet buscabling (RG62/U 92 ohm non-star coaxial cable).andM;Nearly all networks installed prior to 1988 use either coaxial cable ormulticonductor cable connections.andP;  Re-cabling old networks with twisted paircabling or adding workstations to them has become easier, if not moreexpensive: all three topologies--token ring, Ethernet, and ARCnet--now comein twisted-pair (telephone-like or telephone-type) cable flavors.andP;  Thetwisted pair cabling plans for all three protocols have distance limitationscompared to their coaxial or multi-conductor predecessors, and are moresusceptible to noise.andP;  In each case, however, adaptations have been made toaccommodate new or inherited non-twisted pair NICs.andP;  Token ring NICs requiremedia filters, Ethernet NICs require various converter assemblies, and ARCnetcards require baluns (tiny transformers).andP;  In these three cases, you don'tneed to sacrifice speed for a conversion to twisted pair cabling, as long asyou strictly adhere to the NIC vendor's recommendations for twisted paircabling/distance limitations.andM;New networksandM;When the desire and budget (lawyers call this motive and opportunity) areavailable for a new network--or a new addition to an existing network formingan internetwork--the possibilities are tremendous.andP;  The rapid evolution ofnetworking platforms raises all sorts of possibilities, the sheer number ofwhich can make choices difficult.andM;A new generation of file server hardware platforms have emerged that looklittle like the typical desktop PC.andP;  These platforms have been designed fromthe ground up to be muscle machine file servers.andP;  They contain hefty powersupplies, loads of drive slots, highly optimized motherboard architectures,and ultra-fast buses.andP;  The network operating systems that are delivered withthem are also optimized--not off the shelf releases.andP;  Most also have addedI/O co-processor power and completely redesigned hard disk controllers.andO;These &quot;microframes&quot; are made by an increasing number of both new and oldcompanies: Compaq's Systempro, ALR, Everex' NextStep, NetFrame's N-400,Tricord, and others.andP;  And while these don't come cheap, they surmount thekludging usually necessary to make desktop machines into healthy andreasonable file servers.andM;The upside to the new generation of file servers is that the optimizeddesigns can blow the doors off the vast majority of standard puzzle-piecedfile server hardware technologies so common today.andP;  The downside to the newset of file servers is twofold: off-the-shelf parts generally can't be usedfor replacement or upgrades, and responsibility for the release of upgradesto the proprietary versions of NOSs resides with the resources of the fileserver vendor.andP;  You can only hope the vendor is quick and attentive.andM;SQL ServiceandM;One of the big thrills of emerging SQL technologies is the hope that throughthe use of file servers-as-database servers, the I/O transactions acrossnetwork wires will decrease--thus expanding the number of users networks cansupport without any discernible system degradation (cause of the fingerdrumming syndrome).andP;  The theory is that a database front end takes a userrequest and forms the request into a SQL query; the query (maybe a 2K to 6Krequest) is read by the database server, which processes the request, andsends the result--perhaps a single, short record, or a fat report.andP;  Thedatabase server might exist inside the file server or as a stand-aloneserver.andM;Realistically, simple SQL transactions between workstations and file/databaseservers are quite small.andP;  That simplicity and small transaction size canbecome gargantuan when 1) multiple servers are used (the database front-endsoftware must keep track of who got what from where, commit transactions,etc.); 2) when empirical retrieval or committal techniques are used(example:&quot;gimme all customers whose last names starts with the letter 'h&quot;');or 3) when very large databases are used.andM;The same performance considerations apply for database servers as for fileservers: fast base computer, fast NIC, and fast media.andP;  Of course, nothingsubstitutes for good database design.andM;Simulation toolsandM;Naturally, it would be nice to have some &quot;scientific&quot; method to gauge networkperformance--short of actually installing it and running your stopwatch.andO;InterNetix supplies a product called LANSIM, a network performance simulator,using performance benchmarks of the National Software Testing Laboratories,IEEE Communications, PC Magazine, and BYTE.andP;  The benefit to networksimulation is that you can garner a reasonable idea of performance whileassembling individual elements--file servers, bridges, workstations,gateways, etc.--into a single but multi-faced model.andP;  The resultingsimulation characteristics shown by LANSIM are I/O models--LANSIM doesn'tquote statistics (like how fast a record will be obtained by a workstationgiven a base level of network traffic).andM;It'll be important for simulator vendors to keep the data fresh; purchaserecommendations based upon simulation results should never be the solecriteria for a purchase decision.andM;Subtler qualitiesandM;A modern proverb states that those who sit on the bleeding edge of technologyneed bandages.andP;  Not enough can be said for competent manufacturer/vendordesign pre-sale support and post-implementation support.andP;  Althoughperformance is an important criteria in the selection of network buildingblocks, I can't say enough for long-term vendor stability and demonstrated(and rapid) adherence to both current and emerging standards.andM;Organizations like the Open Token Foundation, Ethernet 10BaseTInter-operability Consortium, ARCnet Trade Association, and the like arecomprised of manufacturers, software publishers, and other entities concernedabout cross-vendor operability.andP;  Although it's possible to obtain all of thebuilding blocks of a network from a single manufacturer, this is rarely done;without these types of organizations, long term network expansion optionsbecome questionable.andP;  Nothing is more sickening than being caught holding avery fast bag.andM;The big pictureandM;Whether upgrading an inherited network, implementing a new one, or factfinding for your 1991 budget, several performance enhancement techniques canbe used for any network service.andP;  Slow workstations are slow workstations:use the fastest ones affordable.andP;  Healthy file servers deliver data quicklywhen they use fast NICs, a fast hard disk, or optical media, but NOS speed ismostly irrelevant today.andP;  Check with both the NOS vendor and the NIC vendorfrequently for new NIC drivers--not only can new drivers improve performance,but like all other new releases, they can eliminate old bugs.andM;Using the services of a systems integrator, reseller, or consultant whospecializes in networks can make your network integration efforts mucheasier.andP;  Seeing an existing installation using the components you'reconsidering is a great substitute for miles of guesswork.andP;  Networkintegration ties together more diverse components than any other activity inmicro systems work.andP;
