Wood, a Marketshareconsultant.andP;  &quot;Network licensing is a new technology that changes the rules ofthe software sales game.andP;  It will have an impact upon every software andsystems vendor.andM;Ignore at One's PerilandM;&quot;If [software vendors] decide to ignore the technology, they could loserevenue,&quot; he said.andM;Marketshare's conclusions are based on surveys taken last summer of CAD/CAEcustomers and vendors affiliated with 95 medium-to-large corporations.andM;Those companies represent more than $300 million worth of installedworkstations and technical software, according to Wood.andM;The survey revealed that customers believe the network license server is asimportant as the hardware and software it will run on, Wood said.andM;Customers also showed a preference for network licensing and other flexiblelicensing schemes because licensing affords access to available softwaretools, the survey found.andM;Heeding this call, DEC and more than 20 other industry players have notwasted any time in endorsing the new, cost-effective licensing, whichchallenges the customary CPU-per-license procedure used by software vendors.andM;The other vendors that have endorsed network licensing include the following:Lotus Development, Hewlett-Packard, Applied Microsystems, Logic Automation,Highland Software, Intergraph, Computervision, Calma and Frame Technology.andM;The new pricing for the software is based on the number of simultaneous userson a network.andM;The software can then be accessed by all users in a group with the aid of aninterface and a server application.andP;  Companies have been offering suchproducts since 1987, according to Wood.andM;Instead of having two rarely used applications, for example, one licensecould be purchased, and its use could be regulated by the central server.andO;The server limits the number of users to the number of purchased licenses.andM;&quot;[Software vendors are] worried that they'll sell less software,&quot; Wood said.andO;But customers' overall high-tech budgets will not be changing, he said.andO;Customers will shift their emphasis to hardware purchases, however.andM;&quot;Depending upon how software companies play it, hardware companies could winout,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;This means network license servers can help hardware orsoftware vendors gain market share.&quot;andM;Wood added that the new licensing has become a viable option with theproliferation of local area and Ethernet networks and the emergence of remoteprocedure call technology.andM;According to Wood, end users are the ones who will derive the most benefitfrom the new technology.andM;End users will save on the number of software licenses that need to bepurchased.andP;  And they will also benefit from a network management system thatthe new licensing provides.andM;Ultimately, network licensing can be used as a management tool for a moreefficient allocation of hardware, software and workers, Wood said.andP;  &quot;Managerscan now understand the value of their software,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;Some software vendors might be afraid that they are going to be found out,&quot;he added.andP;  &quot;But generally, that's not the case.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
