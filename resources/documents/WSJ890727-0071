One squad, 100 strong and armed with fire hoses, fans out across a 100-yard stretch of cobbled shore, attacking with plumes of water and jets of steam. Others do battle from barges, using huge nozzles mounted on booms to blast cascades of water at the cliffs.    They are fighting oil -- the stubborn residue of North Slope crude still clinging to hundreds of miles of beaches four months after the wreck of the Exxon Valdez precipitated the nation's worst spill. And Exxon Corp. as well as the workers is finding the oil an implacable enemy.    &quot;Some beaches look pretty good after just a half a day&quot; of cleaning, says Randy Vantine, the foreman of a crew of 20 working at another site on Eleanor Island, 20 miles to the north. &quot;But in one place, we spent a month,&quot; he says, trying to rinse crude from a beach. All too often, he adds, the next tide flushes deeply imbedded crude from subsurface crannies and recoats cleaned beaches.    Exxon is clearly finding the mess its tanker left nightmarishly difficult to fix, a fact that led to its stunning disclosure Monday that it expects the cleanup costs to total $1.25 billion. And that's not counting potentially huge compensatory and punitive damage claims.    Lee Raymond, Exxon's president, declined in an interview yesterday to specify its initial cost estimate last May other than to say that &quot;we didn't know very much then, but as time has gone by and things have evolved, the number wasn't out of bounds.&quot;    But Exxon must be dismayed. The new estimate far exceeds the Interior Department's $100 million projection soon after the spill and experts' later estimate that Exxon's bill, including litigation, would be at about $1 billion. It will be the costliest industrial accident on record, easily surpassing the $1.3 billion Three-Mile Island mishap and dwarfing the proposed $470 million Bhopal settlement.    Exxon's basic problem is the oil itself, which has proved extraordinarily persistent in the area's cold water and cool temperatures. Early on, experts hoped that the spill would be largely confined to Prince William Sound and would begin to dissipate naturally in 45 to 90 days. Instead, crude loosed on Bligh Reef, 25 miles south of Valdez, has migrated 470 miles to the southwest, wreaking havoc on seabird rookeries in the Gulf of Alaska, fishing grounds off Kodiak Island and remote beaches along the Alaska Peninsula.    More than half the 27,548 birds known to have been killed died in the Gulf of Alaska, where roaming patches of oil continue to plague beaches and kill sea otters and seals as well as birds. Winter storms may scour some exposed beaches of oil, but scientists fear that by next spring the spill's residue on huge swaths of sheltered beaches will be even more intractable, and expensive to treat, as it hardens to the consistency of asphalt.    &quot;If things don't speed up, there'll be parking lots out there in some areas,&quot; says John Robinson, a science coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. &quot;We'll need picks and shovels instead of water.&quot; Government officials agree that beaches reaching such a condition may linger for a decade or longer as aesthetic nightmares, unusable by humans and potentially dangerous to wildlife.    Mr. Raymond says the reoiling of beaches has been frustrating and concedes, &quot;The oil has stayed with some beaches somewhat longer than I thought it would.&quot;    Nonetheless, Exxon remains sanguine about its ability to get most of the oil off beaches by Sept. 15, when the Gulf of Alaska's notoriously stormy winter weather will set in and make cleanup efforts even harder. &quot;Assuming that we can have people working 'til mid-September {the pullout will be in stages}, we have a good shot at having all the beaches treated,&quot; Mr. Raymond says. &quot;But not clean like Mr. Clean who shows up in your kitchen. Our objective is to make sure the ecosystems are back in shape.&quot;    Despite a pledge in May by Exxon Chairman Lawrence Rawl that the company would return next spring to clean up any leftover oil, O.R. Harrison, Exxon's spill manager, stirred up a tempest on Tuesday by saying Exxon will return to Alaska next spring with only a crew of 20 to survey the beaches, without committing itself to further cleanup work.    But in the interview yesterday, Mr. Raymond promised that Exxon would abide by the Coast Guard's determination next spring as to whether further work is needed. &quot;It's our best guess that there will be a lot less oil than people think,&quot; Mr. Raymond says. &quot;But if the conclusion is reached by the Coast Guard that something needs to be made right and it can be made right, we'll be there. We're not trying to run off.&quot;    However, Mr. Raymond declines to commit Exxon to restoring the beaches to their prior pristine state, although state and federal officials can, if they choose, enforce statutes requiring Exxon to try to do so. &quot;I don't think Exxon is breaking its promise,&quot; he says. &quot;Maybe people weren't listening. Back in May, Larry {Rawl} emphasized getting the toxicity out of the water and off the beaches so the ecosystems can again function.    &quot;There are environmentalists who say that we want our beaches back to looking exactly like they did, but that could actually hurt the ecosystem. You'd have to dig it up or hit it with so much steam it would kill everything.&quot;    However, Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper says, &quot;Virtually from the beginning, Exxon promised Alaskans that the company would stay until the job was done. I expect them to fulfill the promise.&quot;    No one faults Exxon for lack of effort so far. It says it has already spent $600 million mounting what is, in effect, currently the nation's biggest public-works project. It has hired an army of 10,000 people, of which about a third are mopping up the beach. &quot;It looks like D-Day,&quot; Mr. Raymond says. Most work 12-hour days in 14-day stints, collecting almost $17 an hour plus overtime. The company has marshaled an armada of 1,000 boats, including barges capable of housing 500 people, and a squadron of 70 aircraft.    Ballpark estimates indicate a price tag of $90 million a month just for the workers and boats, excluding a slew of other expenses, such as materials, transportation of workers and equipment, waste disposal and reimbursement of public agencies for their work. Although Exxon can recycle some of the oil hosed off beaches, the state is requiring it to ship tons of oil-soaked cleanup materials to a toxic waste dump in Oregon, on the ground that burning would unleash too many toxic pollutants. Exxon contends that this has slowed the cleanup and ballooned the cost.    In some areas of Prince William Sound, cleanup activities are so frenetic that bays sheltering workers have come to resemble floating military encampments. Skiffs turn inshore waters into busy highways. Some coves drone like busy municipal airports as helicopters and small planes ferry in supplies or wing off on reconnaissance missions.    But despite Exxon's epic effort, observers fret that the company is getting little bang for its buck and, even worse, may inadvertently be doing more harm than good in some areas.    Mr. Raymond says the vast majority of beaches haven't been reoiled, and the company claims to have so far &quot;treated&quot; about 140 miles of them -- a figure the state terms about 30% too high. However, John Lough, an Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation employee who tracks progress in daily flights over the sound, says, &quot;I'd be hard pressed to say that there's a treated beach out there that hasn't been subject to some reoiling.&quot;    In addition, many fear increasingly that the most effective cleaning method -- high-pressure, hot-water washing -- may be doing more damage to the sound's near-shore environment than the oil on the beaches. That treatment wasn't chosen by Exxon: It was agreed on by state and federal experts after cold-water rinsing proved virtually useless against the weathered oil.    However, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration studies indicate that beach-blasting with water as hot as 140 degrees Fahrenheit is &quot;cooking the intertidal zone,&quot; destroying organisms within 100 feet of the shoreline, eroding some beaches and building &quot;sand dunes of oily material&quot; that may pose long-term hazards to fish and wildlife, Mr. Robinson says.    Should continuing NOAA studies validate such fears, &quot;we're going to quit washing early, and nobody's going to like that,&quot; says Vice Adm. Clyde E. Robbins, the Coast Guard's Valdez-based spill coordinator. Exxon says it believes that many of the problems of hot-water rinsing can be allayed by reducing the water temperature and exposure time of the beaches.    Nonetheless, Vice Adm. Robbins, NOAA and Exxon are trying desperately to persuade the state to allow the immediate use of an untried Exxon chemical dispersant on the weathered oil. Alaska balked, concerned about possible toxic effects on the summer salmon run and mindful of a political constituency skeptical of using any chemicals in the sound. But the state has agreed to expedite, though not waive, tests to determine the near-term toxicity of the chemical on salmon and other species. Those tests, which typically take a year or longer, are being telescoped into &quot;a matter of days,&quot; though unfavorable results could prompt the state to reject use of the chemicals, says Steve Provant, Alaska's onscene spill coordinator.    Exxon is conducting the tests, and a final decision appears to be days away. Vice Adm. Robbins, who thinks the chemicals could dramatically hasten the cleanup, favors their use even though he sympathizes with the state's point of view.    The Exxon chemical is essentially a solvent -- kerosene stripped of its most toxic compounds and blended with detergent -- and undoubtedly is being prescribed for beaches only because of the oil's stubborn resistance to more conventional treatment, he adds. Unadulterated kerosene was used as a dispersant on a 1967 spill from the Torrey Canyon off the British coast, and scientists concluded it harmed the environment more than the spilled oil did.    The cleanup problems are exacerbated by the porous nature of the sound's rock and pebble beaches. State survey crews conducting test excavations of oiled beaches have found crude four feet deep in some places. Such beaches not only reoil themselves but sometimes unleash what state observers call slicks of &quot;fugitive hydrocarbons&quot; to soil other beaches.    Following a July 14 windstorm, so much oil had been loosed that DEC observer Erlene Blake says some areas &quot;resembled the days right after the tanker went aground.&quot; Indeed, the intractable problem posed by roaming oil was obvious on a recent DEC overflight. Large stretches of beaches on Smith and Little Smith islands, which had been cleaned shortly after the March 24 spill, had been reoiled. And just off those islands, wide ribbons of mousselike oil, a quarter-mile long, lay poised to strike beaches with the next tide.    On the shores of Perry Island, a large rocky outcrop in the western sound, cleanup crews have successfully scoured oil off many moderately fouled beaches. Yet the scene is marred by sheens of oil floating nearby and by the glistening black surface of a large cape at Perry's southern edge that seems to have just been sloshed with fresh crude.    That scene is repeated over and over again. The beaches at Sleepy Bay, a salmon spawning area on the tip of Latouche Island in the southern sound, demonstrate how weathered oil resists cleanup. Exxon crews rinsed the beach several times but recently agreed to stop, and return later, because of concern that cleanup work would impede the salmon run, which has just started.    Yet a walk on the &quot;treated&quot; beaches of Sleepy Bay reveals that some portions of upper beach have already turned slab-like, with rocks welded together by encrusted crude. Near the tide line, the rocks are slippery from wet crude apparently welling up from below the beach.    Hoping to mitigate the damage to salmon that spawn in a stream coursing through a Sleepy Bay beach, Exxon got state permission to dredge up a 20-foot-wide swath of rocky stream bed and replace it with clean fill. Though it was supposed to gouge out only 18 inches of soiled rock, crews found that oil had saturated the stream bed as deep as three feet. They dug out the entire mess -- an act that the state says may have been harmful -- and rebuilt the bed with tons of new material. This ribbon of truly &quot;clean&quot; stream bed winding through blackened &quot;treated&quot; beaches indicates the draconian measures that some feel may be required if beaches are to be truly cleaned.    &quot;It's not that Exxon is the Evil Empire in all this,&quot; DEC's Mr. Lough says. &quot;It's just that so much of what's being done seems to do so little good. It's like Humpty Dumpty -- all the king's horses and all the king's men can't put these beaches back the way they were.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
