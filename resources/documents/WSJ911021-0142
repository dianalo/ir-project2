The new home video games offer rainbows of colors andcrisp stereo sound. They can simulate the flight of anairplane with you at the controls, or spin a murder mysteryin which an actor appears on screen as Sherlock Holmes,offering clues through the television set's speakers.</LP><TEXT>   But progress brings with it a burden that has spared mostvideo-game buyers in recent years: confusion. Since 1986,most consumers didn't have to think much when they went outto buy a new system. They could buy a Nintendo. Or they couldbuy a . . . Nintendo. More than 28 million NintendoEntertainment System units have been sold in the U.S. since1986.   These days, the choice is more complicated. New machines-- based on 16-bit microprocessor chips -- have beenintroduced, and they are a vast improvement over Nintendo'straditional eight-bit systems. (Computers manipulateinformation in words, called bytes, which are groups ofcharacters, known as bits. Sixteen-bit devices operate onbytes of 16 bits, allowing each byte to carry much moreinformation than a byte composed of eight bits.)   Sega of America Inc., a South San Francisco, Calif.,subsidiary of Sega Enterprises Ltd. of Japan, and NECTechnologies Inc., a Wood Dale, Ill., unit of Japan's NECCorp., both offer systems with 16-bit chips. Nintendo ofAmerica Inc., a Redmond, Wash., subsidiary of Nintendo Ltd.of Japan, has just introduced a 16-bit contender of its own.And new technologies, such as compact-disk interactive units,are on the horizon.   &quot;I think eight-bit has seen its best day,&quot; says Ted Hoff,senior vice president of sales and marketing for Tengen Inc.,Milpitas, Calif., which publishes games for Sega's Genesisand the eight-bit Nintendo, including perennial arcadefavorites &quot;PacMan&quot; and &quot;Ms. Pac-Man.&quot; Mr. Hoff says thatGenesis, with its 16-bit technology, &quot;does much greaterjustice to the conversion of our arcade games.&quot;   An on-screen comparison of &quot;Ms. PacMan&quot; for Nintendo'seight-bit machine and the same game on Sega's Genesis backsup that claim. The Genesis graphics are superior: Charactersmove more smoothly, and curved lines drawn on the screen arefilled out more completely.   But for older games such as &quot;Ms. PacMan,&quot; these advantagesare likely to excite only the most die-hard video-gamefanatics. &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; is still &quot;Ms. PacMan,&quot; whatever themachine. It's the newer games, designed specifically for16-bit machines, that best show off 16-bit's virtues.   Sega's &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog,&quot; for instance, boasts abroader variety of colors, higher screen resolution andstereo sound. Conceptually much the same as Nintendo'sblockbuster &quot;Super Mario Bros.,&quot; Sonic looks better and playsfaster. Like Mario Bros., the Sonic game focuses on a maincharacter, controlled by the player, traveling from left toright across the screen and through a maze of &quot;worlds,&quot;looking for prizes to help achieve the game's goal.   But while Mario and his eight-bit brethren look likecartoons sliding over a two-dimensional background, Sonicadds a dimension of depth. When Sonic jumps, objects in theforeground shift substantially while landscape features inthe distance move only slightly. The illusion of followingthe feisty hedgehog in his leap is amazingly effective.   Sixteen-bit computing power also allows programmers tovastly increase the complexity of games, something Nintendosays it demonstrates in its first Super Nintendo title,&quot;Super Mario World,&quot; which features the same mustachioedcharacter as the company's series of eight-bit cartridges.   &quot;The time it will take an advanced or intermediate playerto complete `Super Mario World' will be four or five timesthe length it would take a player to complete a game like`Super Mario Bros. 3,'&quot; says Bill White, a spokesman forNintendo.   All of this is a far cry from &quot;Pong,&quot; which initiated mostAmericans to the world of video games. Introduced as acoin-operated game by Atari Inc. in 1972, Pong was aminimalist's vision of table tennis: a square block of lightbouncing between two vertical white lines on a black screen.By comparison, Super Nintendo can display up to 256 colors atonce, selecting them from a library of more than 32,000different shades. (The eight-bit Nintendo can show 16 colorsat once from a total of 52 available.)   Moreover, 16-bit systems are only part of today'svideo-game story. Games are moving closer to lifelike imagerywith another hardware improvement: compact-disk technology.CD-ROM (for &quot;read-only memory&quot;) units pick up gameinformation from a standard compact disk, indistinguishablein appearance from an audio CD. NEC's 16-bit TurboGrafx-16game system also has a compact-disk accessory, which allowsplayers to use games on CD-ROMs. Sega and Nintendo say theywill offer compact-disk units as well.   Because compact disks can hold far more information thanvideo-game cartridges, they give game programmers the toolsto offer the highest-quality sound, as well as live-actionvideo segments that are filmed rather than drawn on aprogrammer's screen.   &quot;Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective&quot; is a CD-ROM gameavailable for TurboGrafx. In it, the player gets to step intothe role of Sherlock Holmes to solve a murder by visiting thecrime scene, interviewing suspects and taking the case beforea court. During the game, the &quot;real&quot; Sherlock Holmes appearsand speaks to the player. Video segments also feature thosebeing questioned for the crime. The game's publisher, ICOMSimulations of Wheeling, Ill., cast 35 actors for 50 speakingparts in the adventure.   But for all the high-tech specifications, compact-diskgames are still in their infancy. The video segments -- whilefar more sophisticated than any standard system could produce-- are blurry, jerky and slow. The video image fills only asmall portion of the game screen; even with the large storagearea of the compact disk, true video clips don't fit.   Yet, that is, Ken Wirt, vice president and general managerof NEC Technologies, says game programmers are moving up thelearning curve of CD-ROM technology. With data-compressiontechnology that is still being developed, he says, &quot;you couldmake a full-motion, full-screen video.&quot;   That may be what's needed for the games to catch on. Sofar, only about 75,000 TurboGrafx CD units have been sold inthe U.S. Mr. Wirt concedes that the CD-ROM images just aren'tup to the home-electronic standards of the householdvideocassette recorder. &quot;People are looking for basically VHStechnology,&quot; Mr. Wirt says. The explanation may be moresimple than that, though. At $399, the CD accessory is anexpensive option.   In fact, one of the big question marks for all video-gamemakers is price. Specifically: How high can prices go beforeconsumers balk? All the new systems are more expensive thanthe eight-bit Nintendo system, which sells for a suggestedretail price of $79.95. Sega's Genesis is priced at $149.99,while NEC's TurboGrafx checks in at $159.99, without theCD-ROM accessory. The Super Nintendo costs $199.95.   But the real cost is much higher. The game unit is uselesswithout cartridges to play on it. Titles for the eight-bitNintendo cartridges cost between $10 and $50; more than 170million cartridges have been sold to date. Super Nintendogames cost between $50 and $60 each, and the new systemdoesn't play eight-bit games.   How will parents feel about starting over with a new gamesystem?   &quot;I don't like it too much,&quot; says Anna Hildalgo of New YorkCity, as she browses the video-game titles in a lowerManhattan toy store. &quot;It will cost a lot of money.&quot;   Even more skeptical is 14-year-old Ismael Gonzalez, whoasks, &quot;Who's going to buy a $200 Nintendo?&quot;   The answer, according to game makers, is people just likehim.   &quot;The product is being very specifically positioned againstwhat we know to be the real core of the video-game business,&quot;says Peter Main, Nintendo's vice president of marketing. Thatcore is boys, ages eight through 14, who have played theeight-bit Nintendo for two to three years, according to Mr.Main. Sega, which has sold 1.4 million Genesis units in theU.S., estimates that 58% of Genesis buyers are &quot;trading up&quot;from Nintendo.   Game makers obviously hope the question from children andparents isn't whether to trade up but which new system willthey buy. Part of the equation will revolve around softwarecompatibility. Select NEC's TurboGrafx, and every cartridgeyou buy will be playable on the company's TurboExpresshand-held sets; pick any other manufacturer, and you willneed to purchase a duplicate software library for yourportable game.   But the guiding factor will no doubt be the availabilityof exciting software. And in the long term, the most softwaretitles will be produced for the unit in the most homes. Thatmay play to Nintendo's advantage: As the best-known name, itmay attract buyers on that basis alone. The American buyermay even be forced to accept the popular choice in Japan; allof the 16-bit units have been introduced there first.   Meanwhile, more than the games are different. The waythey're being bought is also changing. As it is, many playersavoid buying game cartridges. Instead, they simply rent themovernight from video stores for a couple of dollars. That'susually the cheapest way to get access to a vast array ofsoftware -- unless you become addicted to a particular game,renting it night after night.   At some point, however, players won't even have to go tothe video store. Instead, games will be piped directly intothe home from an outside source, just as movies aretransmitted by cable television. &quot;You're probably looking atsome sort of direct-delivery system, probably through fiberoptics,&quot; says Tengen's Mr. Hoff. &quot;It's not pay per view, it'spay per game.&quot;   New display technologies could also enhance the home videogame. Alexey Pajitnov, the Soviet author of the popularpuzzle game &quot;Tetris,&quot; sees high-definition television as onepossibility. &quot;It will be a machine with HDTV. There will be alot of graphics in the game, and it will be very fast,&quot; saysMr. Pajitnov, now a game creator at Bullet-Proof Software ofRedmond, Wash. A coin-operated Sega game making its debut inarcades displays three-dimensional &quot;holographic&quot; images ofactors playing characters in the game. No actual laser lightis used in the game -- &quot;Hologram Time Traveler.&quot; Instead, aspecial spherical mirror provides the three-dimensionalimages. The effect is spectacular, recalling the scene in&quot;Star Wars&quot; where chess is played with three-dimensionalcharacters parading across a board. Of course, equipment forthis is expensive, and Sega says the technology will takesome time to reach the home, if it ever does.   Game makers are counting on this wizardry to keep playersinterested and buying. But for all the colors available, forall the sounds and rotating backgrounds, customers don't seemto be looking for truly original games. They much preferjazzier versions of the old standards. Of all the titlesavailable now, one of the most popular remains &quot;Super MarioBros. 3&quot; -- which is basically an upgrade of itspredecessors.   Mr. Pajitnov has a theory about that. &quot;It doesn't meanthat most of the customers are stupid and silly,&quot; he says.&quot;It just means that, during entertainment, people don't liketo think very much.&quot;   ---   Mr. Weber is a national copyreader on the Dow Jones NewsService in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
