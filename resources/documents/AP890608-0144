(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A black palm cockatoo, a bird on theendangered species list, was killed by a wild mink at a zoo where itwas taken after being seized in an illegal bird shipment from Asia.   The bird, worth $10,000, was one of three sent to Mesker Park Zoobefore a transfer to other zoos in about three weeks.   The cockatoos, which were not in good health, were sent to Meskerbecause Zoo Director Ron Young is regional coordinator of the PalmCockatoo Consortium, a group that monitors and establishes breedingprograms at zoos.   Only 3,000 pairs of the birds are left in the wild, Young said.   Young said the bird was killed Sunday by a mink that entered thebird's cage through a narrow slit.   ``We've seen the minks, and besides when you've been workingaround a zoo as long as us here, you know by how something's beenkilled what did it,'' Young said. ``The mink, they kill for the funof killing. They are devious creatures. They're a killing machine.''</TEXT></DOC>
