No casualties were reported.   The coup leadership suspended the constitution, placed thecountry under a state of emergency, and declared a nighttime curfewin the capital, Khartoum, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reportedfrom Khartoum. Parliament and political parties were disbanded andnewspaper licenses revoked, it said.   The agency identified the coup leader as Omar Hassan Ahmedel-Bashir and said he signed the decrees. The whereabouts ofel-Mahdi was not known.   El-Bashir has been the third-ranking officer in the paratroopcorps and previously commanded a unit in southern Sudan, accordingto the report.   El-Bashir appeared to be the same person as a man identified asBrig. Gen. Omar Hassan who announced the coup on official RadioOmdurman.   Paratroop and armored units staged the coup, according to theagency, and it indicated the coup leaders were not from the topechelons of the Sudanese military command. ``The coup leaders havedesignated the general command and army leaders as `the formercommand,''' it said.   Soldiers occupied the presidential palace, Cabinet offices, RadioOmdurman, and the official Sudan News Agency. Khartoum InternationalAirport and Sudanese airspace were declared closed.   The agency said ``some political figures and Cabinet ministers''were arrested but it was uncertain if they included el-Mahdi, whobecame prime minister after a May 1986 general election.   A Western diplomat in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, said he had heardthe coup leaders tried to arrest the prime minister at his home inKhartoum but that el-Mahdi escaped.   A military statement said the coup was launched because politicalparties failed to lead the nation.   In February, the military said it would move against el-Mahdiunless he ended Sudan's six-year civil war by accepting a tentativepeace pact worked out between an opposition party and southernrebels. The war has contributed to food riots, widespread hunger inthe south and a severe refugee problem.   The whereabouts of former President Gaafar Nimeiri, accused bythe military June 18 of being behind a failed coup, was not known.Nimeiri was overthrown in 1985 and said recently he planned toreturn to Sudan to seize power.   Sudan, the largest country in Africa, has about 22 millionresidents. It is a poor, predominantly Islamic country roughlyone-third the size of the continental United States.   The military has ruled Sudan for about 23 years of its 33 yearsof independence.   Gili Farah, a Sudan News Agency journalist, said there were noreports of violence during or after the coup.   Traffic was banned on bridges spanning the White Nile and theBlue Nile, but the capital of 2 million appeared otherwise normalfor the Moslem sabbath. No celebrations or demonstrations wereevident.   Omdurman Radio went off the air early today but resumedtransmissions at 8 a.m. with martial music.   ``The June revolution has come to restore to the Sudanese citizenhis injured dignity and rebuild the Sudan of the future,'' theagency quoted the radio as saying.   The Middle East News Agency said the coup leaders identifiedthemselves as the Command Council of the National SalvationRevolution, banned political opposition and political gatherings andwould issue all major legislative and executive decrees. Itschairman is to serve as prime minister, defense minister and armedforces commander-in-chief, it said.   A text of a statement on the radio, read by Brig. Gen. Hassan andalso distributed by the Middle East News Agency, said soldiersstaged the coup because el-Mahdi had ``wasted the country's time andsquandered its energies.''   El-Mahdi, 53, became the country's first civilian leader in 17years when his Umma Party won general elections 37 months ago. Hereplaced a transitional military government that overthrew Nimeiriin April 1985.   His government was dogged by the rebellion of the Sudan People'sLiberation Army, which began under Nimeiri and _ exacerbated byfamine and flood _ has caused economic disarray in Sudan.   Even after the famine ended with rains two years ago, hundreds ofthousands of southern Sudanese died last year because the war keptthem from their fields or drove them from their homes in search ofshelter.   Both sides have used food and control of relief supplies asweapons in the conflict over the northerner-controlled government'seconomic, political and administrative policies toward the south.   The armed forces announced on June 18 that supporters of Nimeirihad tried a coup but failed. Later reports from Khartoum saidseveral dozen military officers and civilians were arrested in thecoup attempt.   Nimeiri, a political refugee in Cairo since he was overthrown,denied he was behind that coup attempt. But he said in an interviewlast week that he intended to return to Sudan and expressedconfidence he would regain power.   On Sunday, a Nimeiri aide in Cairo said the former president hadleft Egypt two days earlier. The aide refused to disclose Nimeiri'sdestination.   Today's coup announcement gave no indication that the formerpresident was involved.</TEXT></DOC>
