If a tidal barrieris constructed in the Bay of Fundy for power generation, there will bea similar change in surface load due to changes in the tides. This paperexamines whether such changes could trigger earthquakes. Three theoriesof load-induced seismicity are considered, It is concluded that the mostlikely cause is pore pressure variation on a pre-stessed fault plane.Simple diffusion calculations suggest that pore pressure variations propagatedownward and are exponentially damped with depth. The skin depth is proportionalto the square root of the period of the surface load. Tides have suchshort periods that the pore pressure skin depth is andless;1 km even for highlypermeable rocks. Therefore, tidal changes, no matter how large, can onlytrigger shallow earthquakes. A more complete theoretical developmentusing consolidation theory is unlikely to make significant changes inthe conclusions for the Bay of Fundy. It is, however, important for reservoirs,where variations in load occur over much longer intervals. 16 refs.,8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
