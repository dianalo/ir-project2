The pool was developed after thecontroversy over secrecy surrounding the 1982 American militaryoperation in Grenada.   ``The purpose of the pool is to be there at the beginning of theoperation,'' said a Pentagon official, who spoke on condition thathe not be further identified. He said Pentagon pools are usuallydisbanded after the first several days as other reporters arrive onthe scene.   Notifying and assembling the pool takes place under terms ofsecrecy that are unusual for the press. The Pentagon requires thatpool members not tell others about their assignment.   ``We ask them to tell their families that they have been calledto work. That is not that unusual late at night for journalists. Weask them not to have their spouses drive them to Andrews Air ForceBase, but to drive themselves or find some other way of gettingthere,'' said the Pentagon source.   The Pentagon pool in Panama is made up of journalists from thefollowing news organizations: The Associated Press; United PressInternational; Reuters; Time Magazine; ABC Radio; NBC Television;Houston Chronicle; Houston Post, and Dallas Morning News.   The initial writer's report was received at midmorningWednesday, but news organizations were still waiting forphotography from the pool well after noon.   News executives receive short notice when a pool is beingactivated and assign the staff members who provide coverage. Theirmaterial is made available to other media organizations that do nottake part. Participation in the pool is rotated several times ayear.   News executives notified that the pool has been activated arealso sworn to secrecy.   The first pool was formed in April 1985, and they have beenassembled on average of twice a year since then, officials said.   One pool accompanied U.S. Navy warships escorting oil tankersthrough the Persian Gulf in July 1987, but most times reportersreceiving the midnight summons have watched military maneuvers.   The most recent previous pool also went to Panama, in May 1989,a 12-member group that accompanied the first extra detachment ofMarines sent there in Operation Nimrod Dancer. That pool was notkept secret, because President Bush announced the operation earlierin the day.</TEXT></DOC>
