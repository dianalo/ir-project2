During the fire-tests the inner overpressure, the temperaturesof the tank shell, of the liquid and gaseous space and of the fire hadbeen measured. The first test with a tank filled up to 50% liquid propanehad to be stopped after 70 minutes because the gas flow out of leakingfittings and valves caused a strong additional heating of the top ofthe tank shell. For the second test the thickness of the heat insulationwas increased from 80 to 100 mm and gasket materials with a bigger heatresistance had been used. The second test with a tank, which was onlyfilled up to 20% run successfully over a fire duration of 90 minutes.The heating of the tank contents did not cause a dangerous inner overpressureand the tank shell temperatures remained below 250/sup 0/C. The reportgives a comprehensive description of the construction details with respectto fittings, valves and the fire-resistant insulation and detailed informationon the measuring results. For the tank construction used in the secondfire-test, the first experimental proof of the fire safety requirementfor insulated LPG storage tanks according to TRB 610 (Technical RulePressure Vessels) could be demonstrated.
