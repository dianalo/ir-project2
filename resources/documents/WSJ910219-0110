For two years now the president of Seiko InstrumentsUSA -- a &quot;Gaijin&quot; in the top job -- he is a trailblazer amongAmerican executives of companies fathered in Japan.   He recalls one instance during his nine years as foundinggeneral manager of Toshiba America's computer unit, based inIrvine, Calif. &quot;I was going to take one of the Japaneseplanning managers skiing. It's the God-given right of everyskiier to leave at 2 or 3 o'clock on a Friday afternoon, upto Mammoth {Mountain}. He sort of squirmed and said, `I'vegot an appointment, I can't do it.' He left right at fiveo'clock.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;They're very rigorous. They dress up. At lunch there's nodrinking, and also lunch goes between 12 and 1 -- they don'twork through lunch hour and then take a lunch between 1 and2. They never leave before 5 o'clock no matter what. It'salmost like the military. They try to set real examples withwhat they're doing.&quot;   That conforms to stereotype. But Mr. Rehfeld has noticedanother side: &quot;When they fly, and they're alone, they neverwork on an airplane. They read personal stuff, or sleep. Andthey don't work on the weekends. When it's visible andthey're setting an example, they're like soliders. And whenthey're on their own, they're pretty lazy.&quot;   It's been three months since Mr. Rehfeld told other taleson Japanese management in the Harvard Business Review.Actually, his tone was generally admiring as he describedadjusting to a new order, mostly at Toshiba. A central themeis &quot;kaizen,&quot; the constant Japanese pursuit of improvementrather than result, and the consequent absense of credit orblame. The president of his current parent, SeikoInstruments, said he liked the piece. So Mr. Rehfeld, 50, isdue to stay No. 1 at the American arm of the watchmaker --cumminiaturizer in high technology.   At Toshiba, he developed the company's laptop market, anultimate success. But he was working under a Japanesepresident in the U.S., with responsibility for profits andlosses but not authority over the balance sheet. He couldn'tset credit lines for his customers, for example. And, thoughhe says relationships were good with the on-site Japanese&quot;shadow managers&quot; that often dominate a subsidiary in theU.S., he wasn't free to establish the &quot;open culture&quot; he hasat Seiko.   Mr. Rehfeld is geographically well situated to emerge as atrend-setter. Seiko's headquarters are in Torrance, Calif.,the hub city of the so-called South Bay area, between LosAngeles International Airport and Long Beach. According toSteven Clemons, who directs the Japan-America Society ofSouthern California, more than a third of 1,400 subsidiariesof Japanese companies located in his region are concentratedin the South Bay.   Women among Seiko's 350 employees in Torrance and SanJose, Calif., may gain the most from having an American incharge. &quot;Japanese companies are unwilling to invest intraining their female employees,&quot; Mr. Rehfeld noted in theHarvard article. &quot;I've often seen very competent women whohave graduated from the top universities do little more thanserve tea.&quot; In Japan, by using a formally polite &quot;subservientkind of language,&quot; women &quot;automatically classify themselvesas second class citizens.&quot;   Convention forbids a Japanese senior executive from havinga woman report directly to him, so at virtually all Japanesecompanies in the U.S. that puts a whole level of managementoff-limits. At Seiko, although none is yet a second tierexecutive &quot;a woman is equally qualified with a man for everyjob here, except mine -- and I do report to a Japanese,&quot; hesays. &quot;But there's no Japanese in this {U.S.} company with aline-management responsibility.&quot; The &quot;factory dispatches,&quot; asthe men from the home office are known at U.S. subsidiaries,act at his shop mainly as communicators back to Japan, hesays.   In other respects, however, Seiko is typical. It has nostaff lawyers -- contracts are drawn up by outside counseland nearly all disputes are resolved by mutual agreement. Andthough Mr. Rehfeld claims profitability, margins aresacrificed to build a sales base. &quot;The whole feeling is,invest a lot of money in visiting the customer, because he'llbe a customer a long time, and we'll get more market share,&quot;he says. &quot;Market share is good because it allows us to buildplants and employ people and build lots of things.&quot;   Seiko USA doesn't do the actual building. It markets anddoes ancillary engineering for a line ranging from colormonitors and printers for personal and industrial computersto precision-assembly robots to electronic pocketdictionaries and &quot;translators.&quot; The corporate motto is &quot;BigTechnology in Small Packages.&quot; Technologies stem from 50years of making wristwatches (which are marketed in the U.S.by a different Seiko unit).   Mr. Rehfeld says the company, which doesn't make publicits results, grows 40% a year and has &quot;a couple hundredmillion&quot; dollars in sales, 16% of Seiko Instruments'international non-watch business. With the dollar depressedrelative to the yen, it makes sense for such a business toinvest now in future returns and realize them when the U.S.currency is stronger.   Yet, as he wrote in his magazine article, the Japanese aresticklers for accounting all the while they throw money atmarketing. He elaborates, &quot;In a Japanese company, it's nothow much money you make, it's whether you achieve yourbudget. It's almost a warlike, militarylike loyalty to thatbudget. In fact, they talk like, if you're missing thebudget, what countermeasures do you take? If I put in abudget that gets approved by the board of directors, and ithas a million dollars in sales and a million dollars intravel expense . . . then that's OK.&quot;   In Hollywood, where Japanese companies have becomesignificant stepparents, locals may like the sound of thosemillions but not the martial melody. Other U.S. industriesmay also be difficult fits for Japan, he thinks. Computersoftware design, for example, is rather free-spirited.   But in some capital-intensive fields, the wherewithal ofYen Daddies can mean the difference for competitive U.S.production. Seiko USA is primarily a sales outfit forimported wares, but some other Japanese subsidiaries employheavily. Dated studies suggest that Japanese companies inCalifornia alone have hired well over 100,000, mostlyAmericans. At a time of widespread capital squeeze in theU.S., their investment holds the key to jobs in high-valuemanufacturing for many.   This increasing Japanese presence is going to make it moredifficult for U.S. policy makers to set up the kind of&quot;industrial policy&quot; research-and-development combines --Americans only, please -- that some advocate. At the sametime, Mr. Rehfeld's accounts, by exposing various Japanesebusiness practices to comparison and even emulation,contribute to a blending of corporate cultures. The work ofthe economic nationalists grows evermore unavailing.</TEXT></DOC>
