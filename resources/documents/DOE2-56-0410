Until recently,software-engineering technology has focused on the use of conventionalvon Neumann computer architectures. Current computer systems featurecontinually increasing computational resource requirements which havebecome unfeasible or unrealizable using conventional von Neumann techniques.Non-von Neumann architectures featuring multiple-processing elementsoffer solutions that achieve the application requirement. However, software-engineeringtechnology remains oriented towards von Neumann methodologies. This,coupled with the applications-specific nature of non-von Neumann architectures,has resulted in a fragmented software-engineering environment. This effortprovided a very thorough view of many of the software-engineering problemsthat are currently associated with the utilization of non-von Neumanncomputers. The results of this study support current and future applicationsprograms by providing sound rules to architecture selection and systemand software life-cycle definition.</TEXT></DOC>
