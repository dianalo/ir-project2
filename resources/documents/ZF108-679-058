(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>OSF's DCEandM;THE OPEN SOFTWARE Foundation (OSF) has released its selections for the firstphase of a Distributed Computing Environment (DCE).andP;  This request fortechnology (RFT) process was a great deal more complicated than the userinterface RFT.andP;  After the initial request for technology in June 1989, OSFreceived 50 responses.andP;  By October, these had been winnowed down to 29 finalsubmissions.andP;  As a result of the initial RFT, OSF went through the process ofdefining a taxonomy of Distributed Computing Environments.andP;  This taxonomyshould prove even more useful than the selected technologies, as it providesa common framework for discussion of DCE issues.andP;  We explored these areas inour January 1990 issue.andM;The selection of technologies for a Distributed Computing Environment bringsto a close the second such major venture on OSF's part, the first being, ofcourse, Motif.andP;  (We're leaving aside the kernel issues for now.)andM;One of the most interesting results of the initial RFT was the forming of theDeCorum group for a joint technology submission.andP;  A group of vendors(Digital, HP, Microsoft, Transarc, and Locus) banded together to submit acomprehensive suite of networking protocols and services.andP;  One of the firstdiscussions OSF members had about the RFT was whether or not a submission ascomprehensive as DeCorum was warranted at this time.andM;Almost immediately, certain vendors (notably Sun) began suggesting that theDeCorum technology was a shoo-in, not because of technical excellence, butbecause the submitters were, in fact, OSF heavies.andM;Although the final selection does use some portion of the DeCorumtechnologies, it is certainly not a blanket adoption of the proposal.andP;  Thefinal offering contains more from Digital Equipment than orginally envisionedand uses an X.500 name service from Siemens, while bypassing some of theDeCorum technology (such as Locus's TCF).andM;Rumors have been bubbling up through the conversational mud surrounding thisselection to the effect that OSF management strong-armed the technicalselection.andM;Not so, according to the OSF technical folks.andP;  The technical consultantsapparently were in agreement on the quality and worth of the selectedtechnologies.andP;  There was some disagreement on what that actually should meanin terms of implementation and roll-out, however.andM;At this point, it is important to note that the consultants involved in theselection were quite an eclectic bunch, including the chief scientist fromATandamp;T as well as others without a vested interest in OSF or its ultimatesuccess.andM;But the net of the selection is that OSF has a strong set of technologiesthat, in their very design, are intended to span multiple platforms.andP;  One ofthe critical selection points for the OSF DCE was platform and operatingenvironment independence.andP;  As we've pointed out before, this isn't a Unixissue; the DCE has to transcend platforms.andP;  That desire for aplatform-independent, portable solution is really a characteristic of manyOSF companies.andP;  The IBMs, HPs, and Digitals all need solutions that they feelscale well within their current mixed-systems networks.andP;  The OSF DCEselection process wasn't about the best Unix network platform; it was aboutthe best set of enablers for a mixed distributed network environment.andM;The technologies are:andM;* Network Computing System (NCS) 2.0 from HP/Apollo with Digital enhancementsfor the RPC mechanismandM;* Andrew File System (AFS) 4.0 from Transarc for a distributed file systemandM;* Support for diskless workstations from Transarc and HPandM;* Kerberos, with HP extensions for authorizationandM;* LAN Manager for Unix (LM/X) from Microsoft, and PC-NFS from Sun for PCintegrationandM;* DECdns from Digital with DIR-X from Siemens for X.500 directory serviceandM;* Concert Multithreaded Architecture (CMA) from Digital for threadsandM;* DECdts from Digital for a time serviceandM;As with Motif, OSF is putting some work into integrating the selectedtechnologies, and will package them under a name which is undetermined at thetime of this writing.andP;  As a result, the technologies will be available as anOSF Remote Procedure Call, an OSF Distributed Naming Service, an OSFDistributed Time Service, an OSF Threads Service, an OSF Distributed FileSystem, an OSF Distributed Security Service, and an OSF Personal ComputerIntegration Service.andM;For its part, Sun plans to enhance its Open Network Computing (ONC)environment with the same set of services being offered by OSF, although at aslightly slower rate, since Sun intends to develop much of it itself.andM;Sun also agrees with the notion that a distributed computing environment isplatform independent.andP;  However, the reality of Sun's base is that Unixdominates.andP;  Sun's work with ONC is clearly targeted to its perception of theneeds of its customers.andM;So, apparently, there will be two contending DCE platforms: the one from Sunand the one specified by the OSF.andP;  There aren't absolute barriers between thetwo; however, there is less compatibility than there should be in an idealworld.andP;  Some users won't be happy to hear about further disagreement, but theOSF suggestion should certainly please the Enterprise customers, who now havethe prospect of advanced interoperability among the systems in theirheterogeneous networks.andP;  And that interoperability was OSF's target in thefirst place.andM;Furthermore, Sun's &quot;I'll do it myself&quot; attitude carries with it the burdeninherent in any such situation: i.e., it takes longer to re-invent somethingon your own than to adopt a suite of technologies proffered as a standard.andO;Unix-camp contests aside, the vendors who now will adopt OSF DCE recognizethat it would take them too long and cost them too much to develop the entireset of requisite functionality by themselves.andM;Market vs.andP;  Technical Contexts.andP;  There are two views of the DCE selection.andO;One is filtered by market needs; the other, by technical criteria.andP;  Theselected DCE components are very strong technically.andP;  The selectionhighlights what can be beneficial about a consortium-based standards process:Together, the cooperating companies achieve much more than they couldstruggling along on their own.andP;  The resulting OSF DCE certainly is more thanany one vendor offers today.andM;Market issues are not as clear-cut, however.andP;  Although there is an installedbase of Sun ONC systems, there is also a base of NCS systems and solutions(NCS being one of the component DeCorum technologies).andP;  In many cases, we'llguess, the users have just barely scratched the surface of the technicalcapabilities of either platform.andP;  A Range Rover may be theoreticallypreferable to a Jeep, yet neither exploits its capabilities in congested citytraffic.andM;Approached from one angle, this lack of exploitation could give support tothe Sun approach: Use what's there, and we'll deliver the remainingcapabilities in a few years' time--just about when you're ready for it.andM;Reflecting the wishes of its customer base, the OSF membership has insisted,however, that interoperability is its immediate priority.andP;  OSF pickedtechnologies for its DCE that were ready for implementation and that werewell-suited for a Wide Area Enterprise Network environment built from anumber of disparate systems.andP;  The OSF DCE selection fundamentally is not aUnix issue.andP;  It is an issue of Unix, OS/2, DOS, VMS, MVS, MPE, and so on.andM;Selection Goals.andP;  With market and technical criteria in mind, OSF worked froma set of goals:andM;* The technology should work with existing software.andM;* The technology should work with a variety of operating systems.andP;  OSFintends to provide portable source code and specifications to its members.andM;* The technology should be of production quality: not only reliable, but alsoavailable.andM;* The resulting DCE suite should offer excellent security.andM;* The DCE offering should be scalable to support extremely large wide areanetworks capable of providing a worldwide communication system.andM;* The DCE offering should offer compatibility with standards plus innovation.andO;The OSF products should coexist with other services and use a variety oftransports.andP;  They should interoperate with existing standards, such as NFS,and emerging standards, such as those coming out of the InternationalStandards Organization (ISO).andM;OSF DCE Architecture.andP;  As we noted in our January issue of Network Monitor, adistributed computing environment requires several capabilities if theconcept of &quot;the network is the computer&quot; is actually to be realized.andM;The components selected and designed by the OSF will all work together as asystem.andP;  For example, the Naming Service is single implemented on top of theOSF RPC, and is integrated with the Security Service.andP;  The Threads Service,which provides the portable facilities needed to support concurrentprogramming, is used by a number of OSF services: RPC, Security, Naming,Time, and Distributed File System.andM;Within the architectural framework of a distributed computing environment,the selected technologies meet two primary needs: data-sharing andfundamental distributed services.andP;  (See Illustration 1, page 5.)andM;Remote Procedure Call TechnologyandM;The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) extends a familiar programming model (theprocedure call) across the network.andM;The RPC can handle the issues of distribution (such as semantics, binding tothe server, or communication failures).andP;  In theory, the programmer doesn'thave to become a communications expert to write a distributed networkapplication.andM;Programmers will use an interface specification language to specify theoperations.andP;  Compiling this produces code for both client and server stubs.andM;In order to enable this type of function, the RPC must be simple,transparent, and reliable, and it must perform well.andM;This particular selection received a great deal of attention in the pressbecause it pitted two clear camps against one another--HP/Apollo versus Sunand Netwise.andP;  But the RPC mechanism, although a fundamental component of aDCE, is not the only element involved.andM;OSF narrowed the choices down to three finalists for the RPC: NCS, Sun's ONC,and Netwise.andP;  All three technologies met OSF's minimum requirements formaturity and functionality.andP;  OSF opted for NCS 2.0.andM;NETWORK COMPUTING SYSTEM V2.0.andP;  The NCS OSF selected is not the NCSoriginally developed by Apollo.andP;  NCS 2.0 is a joint product of DigitalEquipment and Hewlett-Packard that extends the original NCS with a variety offeatures, including the following:andM;* Transport independenceandM;* Name service independenceandM;* Support for ISO standardsandM;* Support for large data processing applicationsandM;NCS imposes no limits on the number, type, or size of parameters to RPCs.andP;  Ituses the Network Data Representation (NDR) to encode the data.andP;  Rather thanthe canonical approach chosen by Sun with eXternal Data Representation (XDR),NDR uses a &quot;receiver make it right&quot; approach.andP;  In other words, it is up tothe receiver to convert the data representation only when the incoming formatdiffers from the receiver's native format.andP;  Although this pairwise conversionmay seem counterintuitive in a marketplace increasingly driven to canonicalintermediaries for data exchange by the international standards processes,the Network Computing Architecture (NCA) supporters argue that the overheadincurred in the translation will become a bottleneck as demands on thenetwork grow.andP;  Add to this the contentions that the highest volume ofcommunications between systems is within a given workgroup and thathomogeneity is more likely than heterogeneity within that workgroup, and theNCA approach appears more pragmatic.andP;  In addition, the NDR is actuallysomething of a hybrid between the receiver-makes-it-right approach and thecanonical approach, so the actual burden of conversion is something less thanthe [n.sup.2-n] number of conversions mandated in a pairwise scheme.andM;To support NCS 2.0, HP and Digital extended NDR in the following areas:andM;* Support for large arrays.andP;  In earlier implementations, the size of arrays(other than fixed arrays) was limited to 64K or fewer elements.andP;  Thisrestriction is no longer applicable.andM;* Support for pipes.andP;  Pipes represent open-ended sequences of values of asingle type.andP;  The pipe sender doesn't have to know the final size of the datasequence to be sent.andP;  Pipes are represented in NCS 2.0 by a series of varyinglarge arrays.andM;* Context handle.andP;  NCA uses an object-oriented binding model.andP;  In otherwords, it encourages developers to think of remote calls as operations uponobjects, not as calls to specific machines or server processes.andP;  The goal ofthe NCA designers was to reduce the precision with which a developer mustspecify the location of a target for a call.andP;  A very important aspect of thisobject-oriented model is the use of a 128-bit, fixed-length Universal UniqueIdentifier (UUID) as the lowest level identification mechanism for any entityon the network.andP;  The NCA architects claim that the advantages of the UUIDover a simple string identifier at the lowest level of the system include thesmaller size, the ease of embedding the UUID in data structures, locationtransparency, and the ability to layer various naming strategies on top ofthe primitive naming mechanism.andP;  The representation of a context handle is aUUID.andP;  The purpose of a context handle is to allow servers to reclaimresources when either the communications or the client fails in a session.andM;* Structures within embedded pointer fields.andP;  Digital and Hewlett-Packardhave changed NDR's design to avoid copying by allowing pointer fields in therepresentation of a structure to point to the representations of theirreferents.andM;* Other pointer-handling capabilities.andM;OSF is saying that the NCS Network Interface Definition Language (NIDL)compiler now allows the substitution of NDR with other canonical datarepresentations, such as ASN.1, through the runtime negotiation of anencoding mechanism between peers using a connection-oriented OSI presentationservice.andP;  This will be a major addition to the current capabilities of NCS.andO;In addition, the stub routines are callable from several programminglanguages, allowing the implementation of new applications written indifferent languages.andM;NCS uses a third party in the client/server communication: a broker.andP;  Theclient uses a broadcast binding to find the Location Broker (LB).andP;  TheLocation Broker then returns the network address of a server process that iswilling to handle operations for a specified client object.andM;Developers not wishing to become embroiled with the object-orientedcapabilities of NCA can bypass those object-oriented features and can use NCAas a conventional RPC system.andP;  (The benefit here, presumably, is thepotential for migration in the future to the object-oriented model.)andM;NCS supports both connectionless and connection-oriented transports.andP;  Thestub/run-time interface allows simultaneous support for multiple transportsand application layer protocols.andP;  The binding mechanism allows the selectionof protocols to occur transparently upon binding to a particular server.andM;RELATION TO OTHER DCE COMPONENTS.andP;  NCS is integrated with several core DCEservices, including naming, security, and threads.andP;  The threading capabilityallows both clients and servers to handle multiple concurrent requests.andM;ALTERNATIVES.andP;  Although a variety of RPC mechanisms exist in the marketplace,the only other obvious contender was the Sun/Netwise combination of RPC andRPC compiler.andM;OSF RATIONALE.andP;  OSF based its selection of NCS on the followingconsiderations:andM;* Simplicity.andP;  NCS adheres to the local procedure model as closely aspossible while providing the distributed aspects of applications in astraightforward manner.andP;  In other words, the NCS RPC foists less of aconceptual change upon developers.andP;  Interrupts and pointers work as they doin the local case, reducing programmer learning time of the new tools.andM;* Consistent protocol.andP;  The NCS RPC protocol is clearly specified and is notsubject to user modification.andP;  This guaranteed core is an importantconsideration in a heterogeneous environment requiring interoperability.andP;  Bycontrast, the Netwise RPC-Tool allows (and encourages) users to change thefundamental protocol to add capabilities such as authentication.andP;  Such adistinction is either a benefit or a weakness, depending upon your point ofview.andP;  Netwise is quite pleased with its ability to support customization andbelieves that certain developers will prefer to adopt a package with suchabilities.andP;  Netwise is now referring to NCS as a closed, monolithic system,in effect, conjuring up the bogeyman of a proprietary environment.andP;  OSF, onthe other hand, disagrees, pointing out that NCS is architecturally modular.andM;* Consistent behavior over multiple transports.andP;  Transport behavior isuniform with NCS.andP;  Regardless of the protocol on which it is run, NCSprovides identical behavior and keeps the management of connections invisibleto the end user.andP;  The NCS stub/run-time interface supports a variety oftransports simultaneously and allows new transports and protocols to beintroduced without affecting the coding of the application itself.andP;  TheSun/Netwise offering allows the selection of a transport to affect thesemantics of the RPC.andP;  Using the User Protocol (UDP), for example, imposeslimits on the argument size and number as well as the reliability of thecall.andM;* General DCE needs.andP;  NCS fits in best with the other needs of the DCE:naming, distributed file system, security, and time service.andP;  NCS provides asimple method for developing a clearly defined application protocol, a set oftypes on which to base the protocol, and integration with the authenticationsystem to enable secure communications.andP;  NCS integrates with client andserver threads, preserving the synchronous interface while allowing bothclient and server to exploit concurrency.andP;  NCS's ability to send and receiveindeterminate-length streams of typed data support the distributed filesystem.andP;  By contrast, the Sun/Netwise offering lacked support in pipecapability for the distributed file system, support for Kerberos forauthentication, and thread integration.andM;* Support for standards.andP;  Although the ISO RPC specification is not yet astandard, the draft European Computer Manufacturer's Association (ECMA) RPCstandard and ANSI RPC requirements indicated to OSF that NCS's NIDL is betterpositioned as the future ISO interface definition language than otherofferings.andP;  Furthermore, the modular NCS stub/run-time interface can supportthe introduction of a new ISO RPC protocol with no affect on existingapplications.andP;  The OSF evaluation team felt that the Sun/Netwise submissionwas not designed to enable that swap.andP;  Finally, the OSF evaluation team feltthat the NCS run-time supports more sophisticated ISO-based associationcontrol and presentation context management than the Sun/Netwise offering.andM;THE OFFERING.andP;  The OSF RPC package consists of a C language InterfaceDefinition Language compiler, a set of run-time libraries for linking toclient and server applications, and a broker program to allow clients to findthe appropriate server programs.andP;  The RPC libraries will be supported usingthe X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) or socket interfaces over TCP, UDP,DECnet, and Domain transport protocols.andM;MARKET IMPLICATIONS.andP;  Digital's participation in the restructuring of NCS iscrucial for several reasons, among them the implicit migration to or supportof OSI standards.andP;  Remember, of all vendors in the market, Digital is the onemost publicly vested in OSI-based networking.andP;  Digital's work with andadoption of DCE will go a long way toward dispelling insinuations of OSF DCEbeing anti-OSI.andP;  Indeed, the OSF DCE makes a strong statement toward OSIadoption.andM;Too, Digital has been building toward a distributed computing environment foryears.andP;  It tends to lead the industry with its commitment to strategic WANsand network services to make that a viable platform.andP;  It's not politics thatresulted in so many Digital components in the DCE--it's technology.andM;In general, however, we must note that, although the contention amongdifferent RPC platforms is a great topic of discussion for an industry thatloves to talk to itself, the actual impact on the user community is far fromimmediate.andP;  The current scrapping about the installed base of eithertechnology is a bit nonsensical.andP;  We'd be extremely interested in seeing justhow many of those sites fully use the capabilities of either platform at thistime.andP;  Very few, we guess.andM;The grand conspiracy theories surrounding the OSF selection process ignorecertain historical aspects of the market, namely, that many of thecooperating vendors couldn't stand each other a few years back.andP;  Whycooperate, then, in a group such as the OSF?andP;  Because customers demandinteroperability solutions, and the vendors involved recognized that thedelivery of a foundation for that interoperability was better done incollaboration than in competition.andP;  Again, this is not a Unix issue, nor isit an issue of uniting the Unix world.andP;  It's an issue of delivering thegreatest support for heterogeneous interoperability possible at this point inthe evolution of the market.andM;Could OSF have adopted Sun's RPC/XDR?andP;  Sure, but not without affecting therest of the DCE technologies.andP;  The greatest weakness with Sun's ONC plans, inour opinions, is that Sun intends to do it all itself.andP;  The participating OSFmembers recognized a while back that the task of generating a suite of DCEtechnologies, particularly a set of technologies that spans such a variety ofplatforms, was a task that was far bigger than the resources of any singlevendor.andM;Naming ServiceandM;TechnologyandM;Name or directory services must map large numbers of systems objects (users,organizations, groups, computers, printers, files, processes, services, andso on) to user-oriented names.andP;  The problem in a homogeneous LAN environmentis difficult enough as it is, given moves and changes.andP;  In a heterogeneousWAN environment, the directory task becomes significantly more complex.andM;Furthermore, as distributed applications appear on the network, thedirectories must begin tracking all of those objects and their components aswell.andM;A good name service makes the use of a distributed computing environmenttransparent to the user.andM;OSF established basic criteria for its naming service:andM;* High availability in the presence of machine failures and networkpartitions through replicationandM;* Support for caching to preclude every request going out over the wire withthe subsequent degradation of performanceandM;* SecurityandM;* Support for commonly implemented functions such as a white pages service, ayellow pages service, an alias service, and support for groups ordistribution listsandM;TWO-TIER NAMING ARCHITECTURE.andP;  OSF ended up specifying a two-tierarchitecture for the name service to address both intracell and worldwidecommunications.andP;  The &quot;cell&quot; is a fundamental organizational unit for systemsin the OSF Distributed Computing Environment.andP;  Cells can map to social,political, or organizational boundaries, and consist of computers that mustcommunicate frequently with one another.andP;  Generally, computers in a cell aregeographically close.andP;  Cells range in size from two to thousands ofcomputers, although OSF cites tens to hundreds as being the most commonrange.andP;  (The use of &quot;cell&quot; maps nicely to the taxonomic conventions used byTransarc with its AFS distributed file system.)andM;Although some have pushed for the implementation of X.500 as a commondirectory service at all levels, the current state of specification of thestandard and some of its attendant performance issues make such a decision abit problematic.andM;OSF decided to opt for the X.500 service at the global network level, but toincorporate a high-performance service for the cells.andP;  The high-performancename service within each cell consists of one or more name servers.andP;  Thenaming architecture supports gateway capabilities to allow the cell nameservice to communicate with the X.500 directory service.andM;OSF selected two submissions for its naming service: Digital's DEChns for thecell name service and Siemen's DIR-X X.500 service for global communications(Illustration 2).andP;  Users may address the X.500 name server directly with OSIprotocols, rather than through the cell name service gateway.andM;OSF is using the X/Open Directory Service (XDSe as a common API foraddressing either cell or remote name services.andP;  Each service contains bothlocal and global user agents.andP;  The boundaries of the naming services shouldbe transparent.andP;  The application can access the global directory via thelocal service; similarly, the X.500 service views the cell name service asone of its directory management domains.andM;DECdns.andP;  Digital faced a bit of an internal contradiction.andP;  In itsself-appointed role as a evangelist for OSI networking (Phase V, forexample), Digital has been working on an promoting an X.500 directoryservice.andP;  However, it uses its own Distributed Naming Service (DECdns, aDECnet System Service) as its currnt solution in the absence of a fullyfunctioning X.500 service.andM;At the time of the OSF decision, Digital was itself heading toward a two-tierdecision, whereby it would continue to use DECdns as a cell naming serviceand bridge to an X.500 global directory.andP;  Now that decision for Digital hasbecome much easier.andM;The DECdns database can be distributed across the network on more than onenode to deliver higher availability and performance benefits.andP;  DECdnscoordinates multiple name-bases for consistency in a multiple name serverenvironment.andM;DECdns offers caching, replication, and security capabilities.andP;  The cachingand replication can handle very large systems; this was to be Digital'sglobal name service for DECnet (with appropriate migration to X.500).andP;  Thename service thus has the capability of supporting global WANs in abeyance ofyet unspecified X.500 capabilities.andP;  Furthermore, because of Digital'sintention to incorporate X.500 specifications at some point, the DECdnsarchitecture has a great deal in common with that of X.500 DECdns also bringswith it a set of management tools for the name service.andM;SIEMENS'S DIR-X.andP;  OSF also sought caching, replication, and managementinterfaces in its X.500 service, and, for that reason, opted for DIR-X fromSiemens.andP;  DIR-X supports all of the 1988 standard services specified by X.500(including a Directory Service Agent and a Directory User Agent), as well asfunctions not yet specified by the standard.andP;  DIR-X offers access control,shadowing, remote administration, dynamic name and attribute structures, andtree-handling functions.andM;DIR-X supports a Siemens implementation of Remote Operations Service Element(ROSE), ROS-X.andP;  The ROS-X implementation also supports ACSE and ASN-1.andM;ALTERNATIVES.andP;  OSF considered one other cell service and one other globalX.500 service.andM;HP submitted its new Network Directory (ND) service.andP;  Designed for use withNCS, it performs lookups based on name or internal ID and its accessible viathe NCS/RPC.andP;  OSF rejected it because it is a new base of code and because ithas no compelling advantage over DECdns.andM;Retix submitted its DS-520 service, which offers standard X.500 function aswell as security, OSI upper-layer protocols, and an ASN.1 compiler.andP;  OSFrejected this offering because of its lack of caching and replication.andM;RELATION TO OTHER DCE COMPONENTS.andP;  The DECdns component will be integratedwith the RPC, security, and distributed file services components of the OSFDCE.andM;THE OSF NAME SERVICE OFFERING.andP;  The OSF's choice of name service offeringwill include both DECdns and DIR-X, including clients, servers, managementtools, replication daemons, XDS-based programming interfaces, a cell/globalgateway, OSI services (presentation, session, ROS, and ASN.1 compiler), and agateway to Internet Domain Name Service.andM;Security TechnologyandM;For political as well as technical reasons, security is one of the moresensitive issues surrounding the migration to network computing environments.andO;Given the periodic assaults of worms and viruses on networks (especially theInternet), corporate MIS planners are understandably leery of opening up thecoffers of strategic corporate data to malefactors.andM;There are two broad categories of security services: authentication andauthorization.andP;  Authentication verifies the identify of an entity (a user ora service).andP;  Authorization verifies the control) grants privileges to theentity, such as access to a file.andM;In a distributed network environment, which is, by definition, aclient/server environment, the authentication and authorization processesmust use messages to fulfill their tasks.andP;  However, messages can be forged,and therefore have an inherent untrustworthiness in the absence of networksageguards.andM;Although many vendors hasve dealth with the issue of access control for anapplication on a homogeneous network, the problem obviously becomes morecomplex in a heterogeneous environment.andP;  In addition to the required securitycapabilities, access control in a DCE really requires some form of policy forsecurity domains.andP;  In other words, as the scope of the problem expands, thecapabilities of the applied solution need to become both broader and moreflexible.andP;  Security domains, as a specific example, can reduce theadministrative overhead required within a DCE.andP;  Furthermore, the whole notionof distributed security is somewhat new.andP;  There is no corresponding OrangeBook for DoD trusted system guidelines in the network world.andM;Authorization alone is only a partial solution.andP;  Although you can force aworkstation or host to prove its identity, you can still end up relying uponthe system's word as to the identity of a given user.andP;  Authenticationservices must exist within a distributed environment, where a workstationcannot be trusted to identify itself or its users correctly to shared networkservices.andP;  An authentication service is a mechanism for providing trustedthird-party verification of user identities.andM;An authentication service, which basically requires the user to prove his orher identity for each required service, must be secure, reliable,transparent, and scalable.andM;KERBEROS WITH HP EXTENSIONS.andP;  OSF opted for the Kerberos authenticationsystem, augmented with security components from Hewlett-Packard.andM;Kerberos, developed by the folks at MIT's Project Athena, uses private keyencryption: Each Kerberos principal (entity) has a private key known only tothe principal and to Kerberos.andP;  Kerberos maintains a database of clients andtheir keys.andP;  Although a network may run Kerberos on more than one machine,only one definitive copy of the Kerberos database exists.andP;  Other Kerberosservers may use read-only copies of the database to eliminate singlepoint-of-failure issues.andM;Kerberos provides three levels of protection.andP;  The lowest requires only thatautheticity be established at the initiation of a connection, assuming thatsubsequent network messages flow from the authenticated principal.andP;  The nextlevel up requires the authentication of each network message.andP;  On the levelbeyond these safe messages are private messages, where each message isencrypated as well as authenticated.andM;HP, in its own work on a network security service, also used Kerberos as anauthentication service, but added a registry service and an authorizationservice as well.andP;  OSF decided to incorporate the HP work on replicationsupport, testing, and documenta tion to the basic Kerberos Version 5 packagefrom MIT, as well as the registry service.andM;The account registry service is based on HP's (originally Apollo's) PasswdEtc Tool.andP;  Passwd Etc manages user login password and account informationacross networks through the maintenance of a single logical database for allinformation rather than through the use of multiple files on multiplemachines.andP;  The logical database eliminates the potential for conflicts inlogins and passwords across the network.andM;OSF is also including authorization checks based on Posix-conformant accesscontrol lists (ACLs) and an authentication interface to the RPC.andM;In addition, OSF intends to ensure that applications for the DCE will beportable from Kerberos to public key-authentication schemes which useencryption systems such as those specified by the X.509 standard.andM;ALTERNATIVES.andP;  Aside from the HP material (some of which is incorporated inthe selection), OSF also considered UniWare's UniDesK/Config.andP;  The uses acentralized authorization server that issues tokens to users and verifies(upon request from an application server) that the user is authorized.andP;  Thedesign of the system requires real-time exchange between t he applicationserver and the centalized ConfServ.andP;  OSF decided against the central serverapproach because of the performance and availability issues inherent in sucha system design.andM;OSF is achieving some of the same functional results by using server-specificauthorization in components such as the naming system and the distributedfile system.andM;Threads TechnologyandM;Traditionally, applications deal with processes, each with a single thread ofcontrol.andP;  Under this model, multiple tasks within applications are dividedamong multiple, communicating processes.andP;  Threads are an important emergingmodel for expressing parallelism within a process.andP;  Essentially, the threadsmodel extends the process model to multiple threads of control that shareboth a single address space and a set of resources.andM;On a system providing hardware and software support for prallel execution,threading can increase the speed of execution by giving an applicationdeveloper the ability to utilize all the available processors.andP;  Even on auniprocessord system, threads are still useful for mapping asynchronousbehavior into equivalent synchrounous behavior.andP;  Threads can model theparallelism inherent in windowing environments, real-time event processing,transactional processing, and networked/distributed systems.andM;Threading capability becomes particularly important within the context of theutilization of a remote procedure call, which is inherently a synchronousactivity.andP;  The presence of threads, for example, would allow a server tobegin processing the data from a read request while the server waits toreceive another chunk of data.andM;The threads model puts less demand on the skill of a programmer than wouldother parallelism alternatives such as explicit asyncronous operations orshared memory.andP;  Asynchronous interfaces, although they've existed in someenvironments for some time, have often proven problematic in implementation.andO;(The nonblocking I/O polling and I/O completion signaling facilities in BSDexamples.)andP;  Threads maintain a synchronous view of the world, rather thanforcing developers to think about asynchronous design.andM;There are two basic models for implementing threads in a system.andP;  The firstuses kernel-level threads; the second uses process-level threads.andM;The latter, which provides thread services via library functions, has somefunctional restrictions as compared to the former, but it is really the onlymodel appropriate for broad heterogenerous interoperability.andM;Kernel-level threads require the modification of the operating system kernel.andO;The benefit, however, is that the threads, rather than the larger process,become the basic schedulable entity within a system.andP;  In a process-levelthread implementation, the kernel is unaware of the threads; it still usesthe entire process as the basic scheduling entity.andM;One limitation resulting from the library-based process-level implementationsis the lack of support for parallelism on multiprocessors.andP;  In order to runtwo threads of a single process simultaneously on two processors, the kernelwould have to be able to schedule at the thread rather than the processlevel.andM;DIGITAL CMA.andP;  CMU brought the concept of threads to public attention when itembedded the concept within Mach.andP;  Sun also introduced a similar notion withits Lightweight Processes in Sun/OS 4.0.andP;  Other environment (such as Apollo'sDomain) also support threading.andM;However, in 1989, Digital announced its Concert Multithreaded Architecture(CMA), with the implicit goal implementing it on both VMS and Ultrix.andM;CMA, which was the only package submitted to OSF in this technology are, is auser-space, single-process, coroutine-based thread package that is completelyconformant to the draft Posix 1003.4a threads interface specification.andP;  (SeeIllustration 3 at the left.)andM;CMA offers synchronization primitives, a variety of scheduling politicies,thread preemption, and thread cancellation.andP;  Additionally, vendors can portCMA to utilize a native kernel-based threads capability as a substrate forfiner-grained parallelism.andP;  Small wrapper environment.andP;  Small wrapperroutines translate the standard CMA calls to the native threads package toensure the correct Posix semantics and handling of errors.andP;  Such a portingwould address the limitation of a library-based threads package noted above.andM;RATIONALE.andP;  Having a common threads capability across a heterogeneous networkis an important consideration.andP;  By incorporating CMA, OSF is doing its bestto guarantee that there will be a minimum threads capability present on allnetwork platforms, and that the threads will use a consistent interface.andM;THE OFFERING.andP;  OSF plans to include the CMa libraries in the OSF DistributedComputing Environment, including the routines defined by the 1003.4aspecification, as well as some C library functions.andP;  The latter are presentto modify some C library routines to avoid the corruption of sharedvariables.andM;MARKET IMPLICATIONS.andP;  Support for threading will be important to encouragethe adoption of distributed computing environments.andP;  OSF, through itsselection of CMA, will be delivering this capability on a variety ofplatforms.andP;  IBM and HP have already indicated their support for CMA.andM;Time Service TechnologyandM;Distributed network systems need a consistent time service.andP;  Many distributedservices, such as distributed file systems and authentication services,compare dates generated upon different computers.andP;  For the comparison to bemeaningful, the DCE must support a consistent time stamp.andP;  The function of adistributed time service is to synchronize the local clocks with UniversalTime Coordiantion (UTC) as well as with the clocks of other network nodes.andM;In a network, the systems break down into two categories: clients andservers.andP;  Clien ts get their time from servers, and servers synchronize withone another.andP;  For reliability and redundancy, a client must be able torequest the time from a number of servers.andP;  The time-selection algoriths mustbe able to handle error situations, be able to avoid loops (such as twoservers requesting the time from one another,) and be flexible enough toaccommodate changes in both network design and topology.andP;  An interface to adefinitive time source, such as an atomic clock, also should be present.andM;DECdts.andP;  OSF selected the Digital Distributed Time Synchronization Service(DECdts).andP;  DECdts incorporates both tracing and management tools in additionto a robust, simple selection algorithm.andM;Additionally, DECdts can interoperate with the Internet Network Time Protocol(NTP), the Internet time service.andM;RELATION TO OTHER DCE COMPONENTS.andP;  DECdts runs over the NCS RPC and utilizesthe threads and authentication services, as well as the naming service.andM;ALTERNATIVES.andP;  The other proposal consideredwas Transac's public domainimplementation of the NTP.andP;  Although both options met the technologyrequirements, OSF opted for the Digital version because of its complete setof management and maintenance tools as well as the design of the algorithm (asimpler one that offered equal reliability, in OSF's opinion).andM;THE OFFEING.andP;  The OSF DCE will include the DECdts server and client, themanagement program, an API for manipulating time stamps, a set of programsthat obtain primany time from a variety of sources, tracing tools, a versionthat runs over the RPC or directly over the LAN link layer, one version withkernel modifications, one version without kernel modifications, anddocumentation.andM;Distributed File SystemandM;Support TechnologyandM;Distributed file systems, as represented by Sun's NFS, were the first widelyadopted implementation of network computing services.andP;  NFS has succeededgreatley at one level: It is widely licensed and has become recognized as ade facto standard.andP;  With its stateless protocol design, NFS allows clients tosurvive a server crash and a planned or unplanned shutdown.andM;However, NFS really needs better cache consistency and locking for sharedread/write.andP;  (Without that, there is a problem with sharing a file betweentwo or more client machines.)andP;  And, although the administration is nottougher than managing a local hard disk, that's still pretty bad--no task foran average user.andM;While recognizing the importance of  NFS (OSF plans to support it in OSF-|),OSF recognized the need for next-generation technology in a general purposedistributed file system.andM;OSF's goals in seeking a better distributed file system:andM;* To retain support for NFS protocols compatibilityandM;* To support an improved protocol for Posix 1003.1 sematicsandM;* To support consistent naming for directories and files across all systemsandM;* To provide coherent system management from any locationandM;* To provide protection and access control of resourcesandM;* To deliver high data availabilityandM;* To support scalability to very large configurations without performancedegradation.andM;AFS 4.0.andP;  OFS selected Andrew File System (AFS) Version 4, offered byTransarc.andP;  While NFS was designed as a LAN-based distributed file system, AFSwas born to address the expanded requirements of a WAN distributed filesystem.andM;The AFS uses a global file space, allowing all client to see the same filename space regardless of location.andP;  (See Illustration 4.).andP;  By contrast, theNFS client refers to a subtree offered by a specific node.andP;  AFS also usesKerberos autentication to manage autonomous administrative domains, analogousto independent Kerberos realms.andP;  The use of these autonomous administrativedomains--or cells--endows AFS with excellent scalability.andP;  The cellscooperate to provide the global file space.andM;AFS tries to minimize network and server loads by caching accessed data onthe local disk and caching the status of the data in memory.andP;  In AFS, theserver notifies the client in case the data at the server changes.andP;  Thisguaranteed callback ensures cache consistency.andP;  In Carnegie MellonUniversity's experience with the AFS, caching with callbacks allowed serversto handle 200 to 300 clients without performance degradation.andP;  (The CMUnetwork is the largest AFS installation, with 3 cells, 25 servers, 1,200clients, and 9,000 users.)andM;AFS v4.0 also offers interoperability with NFS v2 clients, including PC-NFS,through the use of a protocol exporter.andP;  The file system supports the Posix1003.andP;  1a file access and sharing semantics, supports discretionary accesscontrol provided by ACLs specified in Posix 1003.6, and supports InternetBOOTP and TFTP protocols for booting diskless workstations.andM;AFS is an in-kernel implementation built on top of a virtual file systemswitch with extensions (vfs+).andP;  The vfs+ vnode operations are compatible withthose of Sun.andM;The AFS submission to OSF consists of three main functional units: thephysical file system, the server-based protocol exporter and the cachemanager on client machines.andP;  A token mechanism handles synchronization offile access, concurrent file sharing, and advisory and mandatory locking.andM;The physical file system (Episode) uses logical partitions (filesets) thatcan be configured independently of the underlying physical partitions.andP;  Thefilesets handle administrative functions such as replication,reconfiguration, and backup.andP;  The Episode file system offers an interface toaccess control lists.andM;RELATION TO OTHER DCE COMPONENTS.andP;  AFS is implemented with NCS, and isintegrated with the authentication, naming, time, and authorization servicesof the DCE.andM;ALTERNATIVES.andP;  The obvious alternative would have been to adopt theforthcoming NFS Version 3 (although that would open up the issue of RPCmechanisms as well), in which Sun addresses some of the weaknesses of thecurrent version.andP;  According to OSF, Sun withdrew the technology because itwas not ready.andP;  According to Sun partisans, OSF's timing restrictions forcedan artificial rejection of perfectly viable technology.andP;  Whatever the case,Sun has proposed delivering features such as local disk-caching, improvedperformance, improved security, support for replicated file systems, andadministrative improvements within NFS during 1991 and 1992.andM;Personal Computer IntegrationandM;PC integration is fundamental to any successful network scheme, particularlysince the recent offering of Windows 3.0 seems to have given DOS a new set oflegs to carry it ahead well into the '90s.andP;  Macintosh support should be aconsideration for the implementation of network systems as well.andM;OSF's concern in this area was to integrate of DOS PCs in such a way so as todeliver to them client implementations of distributed computing services.andM;LM/X, PC-NFS.andP;  OSF opted for the LAN Manager/X technology submitted byMicrosoft and HP, as well as for Sun's submission of PC-NFS.andP;  The formerclearly is a more significant selection than the latter, which reallyconsists of a public domain daemon for authentication and spooling.andM;LM/X is the client and server implementation of the server message block(SMB) protocol specification.andP;  (X/Open is recommending both LM/X and the SMBinterface and protocol and will specify them in XPG4.)andP;  LM/X also deliversAPI support for Named Pipes, Mailslots, and administration.andM;Although initially viewed as 3Com's next generation PC network foundation,LAN Manager increasingly is becoming repositioned as the strategic PCintegration technology of the large system vendors--such as HP, Digital, andIBM.andP;  This shift is occurring as 3Com's visibility begins to fade.andM;RELATION TO OTHER DCE COMPONENTS.andP;  These personal computer technologies haveno relationship to other DCE technologies; they exist in their own LANs anduse specialized implementation to provide the functionality of otherservices.andM;THE OFFERING.andP;  OSF will provide the LM/X server and the PC-NFS server.andP;  Theprovision of the client applications, OSF feels, falls outside of itspurview.andM;MARKET IMPLICATIONS.andP;  The relationship to PCs and PC LANs is probably themost problematic aspect of the entire OSF selection.andP;  Ideally, we'd like tosee a mechanism for integrating the large (and ever-growing) base of PCnetworks--especially Novell networks--into the DCE.andP;  As it currently stands,however, such integration will fall to the OSF members themselves.andP;  Againstthis is positioned the Novell/Sun/Netwise alliance which, for certain sectorsof the market, could exert a much greater pull on users' interest than theOSF DCE.andM;However, we should also note the healthy increase in the PC LAN business forvendors such as Digital--PCSA is an increasingly popular solution at theenterprise level, primarily because of the additional service delivered aspart of DECnet.andP;  The OSF DCE slots nicely into such a PC LAN approach.andM;OSF FuturesandM;In addition to longer-term goals of incorporating object-orientation andsupport for transaction services, OSF has outlined a number of short- tomedium-term goals in several areas.andM;FUNDAMENTAL SERVICES.andP;  In the area of fundamental services, OSF plans tostress improved portability, deliver new features, and improve theintegration of the components, while preserving the compatibility of theprogramming interfaces and protocols.andP;  Incorporating relevant internationalstandards will, of course, retain a high priority.andM;OSF will offer a version of its DCE integrated in OSF/1.andM;END-USER SERVICES.andP;  OSF plans to offer end-user services such as systemmanagement, file system management, license management, etc., as well asprinting and print-spooling.andM;ConclusionsandM;The '90s will be the decade of the distributed computing environment.andP;  We areconvinced that the OSF DCE selections will play a prominent role in drivingthe adoption of such systems.andP;  The OSF DCE is, in concept, kernel neutral.andO;It is designed to foster interoperability at a high level of client andserver functionality across heterogeneous platforms.andM;SUPPORT FOR STANDARDS.andP;  With the DCE selection, OSF is trying to walk thefine line of supporting existing and emerging standards while alsoencouraging new technology.andP;  OSF is following closely in the steps of X/Open.andO;Adherence to Posix interface guidelines is important to the OSF, as is thebeginning of OSI support in areas such as naming and data presentation.andM;PCS AND PC LANS.andP;  As we mentioned above, one weakness in the OSF DCEselection is the lack of a PC LAN solution.andP;  In some ways, this isjustifiably out of the scope of OSF's mission.andP;  In other ways, however,ignoring the PC LAN market is a sure recipe for disaster for the vendorsadopting DCE solutions.andM;LAN Manager is theoretically a very interesting solution, and it becomes moreso with each large vendor implementation (such as ATandamp;T, HP, IBM,Digital--implementations that actually cross OSF and Unix Internationalcamps).andM;However, the LAN market continues to belong to Novell.andP;  That, combined withthe lack of support for DCE services even through LM/X, opens up a challengefor the adopting vendors.andM;That challenge can be met.andP;  One implementation of NCS uses DOS PCs as clients(using an NCS version provided by a smaller vendor) and Prime machinesrunning PICK as servers.andM;Nevertheless, the Sun/Netwise/Novell grouping seems formidable, mainlybecause of the presence of the RPCTool in NetWare 386.andP;  However, Novellcurrently seems in no great hurry to push its user base to migrate fromNetWare 286 to NetWare 386 (where the Netwise tool is incorporated).andP;  Thebulk of the Novell base currently is not particularly interested in or suitedfor some DCE-type solutions.andP;  Novell is remarkably flexible, however, and wesuspect that, as demand grows for DCE solutions within very largeorganizations, Novell will be more than willing to discover a solution.andP;  Wewouldn't be surprised to see elements of the OSF DCE in that solution.andM;COST.andP;  The pricing of the various OSF DCE technologies will be an importantfactor to watch.andP;  Price a solution too high, and you retard implementation.andO;This retardation can be especially severe when it comes to a new technologyarea.andM;TIMING.andP;  OSF intends to deliver a snapshot of DCE in July, with full end-userimplementations available about 18 months from now.andP;  In the meantime,participating vendors are already offering elements of the technology.andP;  IBM,for example, offers NCS RPC and Kerberos on OS/2 EE (TCP/IP extensions) andAIX V.3.andP;  True, the NCS version is not the one to be offered in DCE, butdevelopers can begin learning.andP;  Sun's internal time-table is to push out itsanalogs to the DCE services over an 18-month periods as well.andM;The critical factor here really is the support for implementing this new typeof technology.andP;  Vendors that can actually help customers go in and redesignapplications or can explain how to write truly distributed applications willbe in a much better competitive position.andM;MARKET IMPLICATIONS.andP;  For better or for worse, we're stuck with multiplemodels of a DCE, at least in the marketing furor that will swell for the restof the year.andP;  We don't believe that putting the entire industry's wood behindSun's arrow (to paraphrase McNealy) is the best solution.andP;  Nor can werealistically expect Sun to adopt DCE over ONC.andP;  So, two solutions.andM;Once the marketing din dies down, the industry will discover some very realdifferences among the platforms that will guide selection and implementation.andM;Should everyone rush over to DCE, jettisoning all work?andP;  Certainly not.andP;  Itwould be just as foolhardy to expect all LANs to incorporate DCE instantly asit would be to discount the continued health of terminal-based applicationsfor certain segments of the market.andP;  PC LAN vendors and ISVs in particularwill continue to be intrigued by the Novell/Netwise combination.andP;  We alsoexpect that those same vendors will be intrigued by OSF DCEtechnology--although possibly not for the same customers.andP;  If you are in asituation where you need to deliver high function interoperability among avariety of systems (proprietary and standard, especially from Digital, IBM,or HP), then you should begin learning about the DCE technologies.andP;  At theEnterprise level, DCE is going to have a powerful impact.andP;  At this time, anumber of vendors have already endorsed the selection (including vendors thatalso will offer Sun technology).andP;  DCE is on its way.andM;In the meantime, we encourage the DCE vendors to investigate seriously waysof incorporating NetWare LANs.andP;  And we suggest that Sun lighten up.andP;  If ONCis as magnificent and all-encompassing as it claims, then all the support ofall the big vendors isn't going to be able to stop it.andP;  The protesting isbeginning to sound like whining at best and like whistling in the dark atworst.andP;  Most of all, it is completely unnecessary.andP;  Purchase decisions aren'tgoing to be made on the basis of marketing posturing, but on technologicalfundamentals, and on the support the various vendors can offer in migrationand adoption of the new technologies.andP;  Both sets of vendors (DCE and ONC)have a great deal of work to do during the next few years in incorporatingthe new technology in a rational way, and in providing assistance to theusers.andP;  Strength in those areas, not strength in specs-manship, willestablish success or failure.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
