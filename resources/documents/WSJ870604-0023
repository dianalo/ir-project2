The total value of the aircraft could approach $6 billion, but most of the planes may be leased rather than purchased outright because of Texas Air's current financial situation, industry observers added.    The sources said the Houston-based airline holding company's order is likely to include a firm commitment for 32 Boeing 757s, with options for 68 additional 757s.    The sources said the order also would include 100 Boeing 737s, some under a firm order and some under options. At least some of the orders are slated to be announced at the Paris Air Show, which begins next week, the sources said.    &quot;As a matter of policy, we don't confirm orders until there's a firm&quot; contract, a spokesman for Seattle-based Boeing said. Texas Air declined to comment.    A Texas Air spokesman also refused to talk about industry speculation that the planes would be leased under an arrangement whereby Boeing would retain ownership and financial risk rather than selling the aircraft for cash.    The industry sources said Texas Air, which has a heavy debt load, would be likely to favor direct, short-term leases with Boeing, rather than purchase the planes outright. Such seller-financing has been a part of several recent airline deals.    Boeing last month accepted notes convertible into a 16% stake in Allegis Corp. as part of a sale of 11 747s to Allegis's United Airlines unit. In March, American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., acquired 15 Boeing planes and 25 Airbus Industrie jets through short-term leases -- dubbed by the industry as &quot;rent-a-plane&quot; transactions.    Texas Air's Continental Airlines unit currently operates 737-300s, which seat about 128 passengers and sell for between $25 million and $30 million, the Boeing spokesman said. Texas Air's Eastern Airlines unit operates 757-200s, which carry about 186 passengers and sell for between $41 million and $47 million, he said.    The industry sources couldn't say which of the planes would be used by Eastern and which by Continental.    But Eastern has put 20 of its older Boeing 727 jets on the used-aircraft market, and they could be replaced with the 757, which has greater fuel-efficiency and operates with one fewer engine and one fewer crew member.    However, airline industry analysts say there have been mixed signals concerning Texas Air's intentions to expand or shrink its routes in the East.    The sources also said Continental would be likely to use some of the planes on its new routes.    In the 737 order, Boeing beat out St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp., which has been trying to sell Texas Air its MD-80 jet. McDonnell Douglas &quot;lost based on price. Boeing's price was incredibly low,&quot; said a source close to McDonnell Douglas.    Wolfgang Demisch, an aerospace industry analyst with First Boston Corp., said Boeing's price was rumored to be about $25 million per plane. McDonnell Douglas declined to comment.    Boeing also beat out Airbus Industrie's A-300 and A-310 jets in making the transaction for the Boeing 757, which had been its slowest-selling aircraft. A spokesman for the European consortium declined to comment.    Yesterday, Continental said it would begin daily non-stop service from Houston to three additional cities -- Mobile, Ala., Columbus, Ohio, and Baltimore -- and three weekly non-stop flights between San Diego and Honolulu.    Continental has also acquired seven new airport gates in Cleveland, Ohio, and will begin daily non-stop flights between Denver and Pittsburgh this month. </TEXT></DOC>
