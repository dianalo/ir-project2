The justices said they will consider reinstating a lawsuitagainst a Tillamook County, Ore., landfill by the couple who own anadjacent dairy farm.   A federal appeals court threw out the 1982 suit because the farmcouple failed to notify everyone they were required to under theenvironmental law they used to sue the county.   Olaf and Mary Hallstrom live on a dairy farm near the landfill.   Their 1982 suit alleged that contaminated liquid called leachatedischarged from the landfill caused or contributed to bacterial andchemical pollution of the surface and ground water on their farm.   They contended that the county was violating the ResourceConservation and Recovery Act, one of at least a dozen federalenvironmental laws that gives private citizens the right to sue forenforcement.   The Hallstroms notified the county of their intent to sue wellbefore the 60-day period required by the federal law. But they didnot, as required by the law, give the same notification to thefederal Environmental Protection Agency or the Oregon Department ofEnvironmental Quality.   A federal trial judge treated the failure to comply with thenotification requirements as a procedural flaw remedied by merelydelaying the suit for 60 days.   The judge ruled in 1985 that the county had violated the ResourceConservation and Recovery Act, and ordered the county to remedy theviolation within two years.   The judge refused to award the Hallstroms $95,000 in attorneyfees and legal costs. The couple appealed, and the county filed across-appeal.   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1987 that theHallstroms' lawsuit should have been dismissed because of theirfailure to notify the EPA and the state agency.   The appeals court said the failure represented a jurisdictionalflaw, not a procedural one. Other federal appeals courts havereached the opposite conclusion.   The Bush administration urged the justices to use the Hallstroms'appeal to resolve the conflicting appellate court rulings.   ``The different approaches ... can cause significantly differentresults,'' government lawyers said.   They noted that the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act allowsprivate enforcement lawsuits only if a defendant is allegedlyviolating the law at that time.   ``If a plaintiff's action is dismissed for lack of proper notice,and the defendant promptly comes into compliance with the RCRA, theplaintiff may not file his action again,'' the government lawyerssaid. ``By contrast, if the plaintiff's case were stayed ... thesame defendant would remain liable for civil penalties and possiblyattorneys' fees.''   The government said the 9th Circuit court ruling was correct.   The case is Hallstrom vs. Tillamook County, 88-42.</TEXT></DOC>
