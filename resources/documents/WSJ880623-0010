Treasury bonds posted the biggest gains, with some actively traded issues soaring about 1 3/4 points, or $17.50 for each $1,000 face amount. That was the fifth largest one-day gain this year. The yield on the government's 30-year bonds dropped to 8.92% from 9.09% Tuesday.    In early trading Thursday in Tokyo, the dollar soared even further, fueling additional gains in bond prices. Long-term Treasury issues jumped another point, and the yield on the latest 30-year Treasury bonds fell to 8.83%.    Corporate, municipal and mortgage-backed bonds also climbed in New York yesterday, and about $750 million of new corporate debt issues hit the markets.    Bonds began to rally in the Tokyo market Wednesday as the dollar surged. Traders reacted enthusiastically to the stronger dollar on the theory that it will help defuse inflationary fears and possibly encourage foreign investors to increase their purchases of dollar-denominated securities. Several traders reported large buy orders from overseas yesterday.    The rally accelerated in New York early yesterday after the Commerce Department reported an unexpected 2.2% drop in durable goods orders. That was the biggest decline in nine months and further damped inflation fears.    The durable goods report was &quot;a big surprise,&quot; said William M. Brachfeld, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc. &quot;There is a growing perception in the marketplace that the economy now is expanding at a more moderate, sustainable pace.&quot;    Bond traders also were encouraged by a slight decline in the closely watched federal funds rate, which is the rate on overnight loans between banks. The funds rate, which strongly influences many other borrowing costs, averaged just under 7 1/2% yesterday, after having climbed above 7 1/2% in each of the four previous sessions.    Several analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report interpreted the decline as an indication that the Federal Reserve hasn't tightened credit, as some previously had assumed. But there is still widespread debate about where the funds rate will settle, with several economists saying that technical factors roiling the markets make it especially difficult to analyze Fed strategy.    In Washington, Fed officials have said they haven't made any significant policy changes lately. But they also have indicated a willingness recently to err on the side of a slightly tighter policy to underscore their determination to contain inflation.    Despite the lower funds rate yesterday, many analysts agree the Fed appears willing to tolerate a slightly higher funds rate than earlier this year, when it averaged about 7 3/8%. Several predict funds will average between 7 3/8% and 7 1/2% in the near future.    Treasury Securities   The bond market's strong rally yesterday helped the Treasury sell $8.54 billion of new two-year notes at lower yields than expected.    The average annual yield on the notes was 8.05%. That was down from 8.18% at last month's auction and the lowest since 7.64% at the April sale. As of late yesterday, the yield on the new notes had fallen even further, winding up at 8%.    Today, the Treasury will sell about $6.75 billion of new four-year notes. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the issue was quoted at 8.37%, down from 8.53% Tuesday.    The Treasury received bids totaling $29.18 billion. That was up sharply from $23.52 billion of bids received at the May 25 sale, when a total of $8.27 billion of two-year notes was sold.    Among actively traded issues, the government's 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 soared yesterday to 102 1/8 from 100 11/32. The Treasury's latest 10-year notes rose to 100 27/32 from 99 26/32, while the yield dropped to 8.87% from 9.03%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds jumped 17.40 points, the fifth largest advance this year, to close at 1247.49. The biggest one-day gain this year came Jan. 15, when the index soared more than 30 points. Yesterday's increase was the largest since June 14, when the index rose 21.73.    The index yesterday finished near its high for the day of 1248.48. The low was 1241.53.    Rates fell on short-term Treasury bills. The latest three-month bill rate fell to 6.51% bid from 6.55%, while the latest six-month bill rate declined to 6.78% bid from 6.86%.    Here are details of yesterday's auction of two-year Treasury notes:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.                                          Two-Year Notes Applications .......................... $29,177,375,000 Accepted bids .......................... $8,539,110,000 Accepted at low price ............................. 26% Accepted noncompetitively .............. $1,173,000,000 Average price (rate) ................... 99.909 (8.05%) High price (rate) ...................... 99.927 (8.04%) Low price (rate) ....................... 99.891 (8.06%) Interest rate ................................... 8.00%   The notes are dated June 30 and mature June 30, 1990.   Corporates   More companies tapped the bond markets for funds yesterday to take advantage of recent declines in rates.   About $750 million of new corporate issues came to market. That followed Tuesday's avalanche of about $1 billion of new issues.   Among yesterday's new issues were two offerings of 30-year securities. The issuers were Alabama Power Co. and Westvaco Corp.   Some analysts speculated that more companies may issue 30-year bonds this summer because of the expected absence of new 30-year Treasury bonds. The Treasury probably won't be able to sell its usual volume of new 30-year bonds at the government's August financing, because Congress isn't likely to act anytime soon to increase the government's authority to issue new long-term bonds.   The spread between 10-year and 30-year Treasury bonds has shrunk lately because of the expected scarcity of new 30-year bonds. As of late yesterday, the spread had narrowed to only 0.05 percentage point. As recently as June 14, that spread was 0.13 percentage point.   In the secondary market yesterday, prices of some corporate bonds finished nearly 1 1/4 points higher in moderate dealings.   Municipals   Municipal bond prices also advanced yesterday, although not as much as Treasury bonds.   Dealers said municipals failed to keep pace partly because of concern over a large amount of new state and local government issues coming soon. Although the municipal new-issue market was slow yesterday, the market did receive more than $1 billion of new issues Tuesday.   Only one new issue came to market yesterday. Houston's $110 million of tax and revenue anticipation notes due June 1989 was won via competitive bidding by a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets group. The 5.75% notes were reoffered to investors at prices to yield 5.10%.   In the secondary market, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds due 2018 were trading late in the session at 90 5/8 bid, up 3/4, to yield 8.02%.   Mortgage-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage-backed securities ended a moderately active session with gains of up to 5/8 point but trailed the increases in intermediate-term Treasury issues.   After keeping pace with Treasury securities early in the session, mortgage securities began to lag at midday as selling by mortgage originators intensified and dealers didn't see substantial investor demand.   Many mortgage investors were suspicious about yesterday's sharp gains in the Treasury market, fearing a repeat of last week, when Treasures rallied early in the week and then gave back all those gains by week's end.   Another reason that mortgage securities lagged Treasurys was that there weren't any new offerings of Remics, or real estate mortgage investment conduits. Remic deals tend to raise the price of the underlying mortgage securities as underwriters gather sufficient collateral.   Dealers said the Treasury yield curve continues to flatten, the spread between mortgage-backed and Treasury issues remains narrow, and collateral in the conventional market is scarce. All these factors make it difficult to structure new Remics.   Among active Ginnie Maes, the July 9% issues ended the day at 94 10/32 bid, up 20/32, to yield 9.97% to a 12-year life assumption.   Foreign Bonds   Japanese and West German government bond prices fell yesterday, hurt by the dollar's strength.   &quot;When the dollar held above 127 yen, there were just no buyers in the bond market,&quot; said a trader in Tokyo at a U.S.based bank.   The Japanese government's benchmark 5% No. 105 issue due 1997 closed at a price of 100.87, down 0.89. The yield rose .135 to 4.865%.   In West Germany, traders said the market's weakness was caused by both the dollar's strength and the base-rate increase in Britain. Leading British banks, reacting to a signal from the Bank of England, raised their base lending rate half a point to 9%.   The West German government's 6 1/2% issue due 1998 ended a quarter-point lower at 99.05 to yield 6.631%.   Most analysts believe a rise in West Germany's discount rate, now 2 1/2%, is unlikely so soon after the quarter-point hike in the repurchase agreement rate to 3.50%.   On the new-issue side, syndicate managers say the Kingdom of Thailand has given Deutsche Bank the mandate to launch a mark-denominated issue. Managers at the bank wouldn't comment. Given the weak market, participants say it's unlikely that the issue will be launched this week. Thailand recently launched a Swiss franc issue, via Credit Suisse.   In London, prices of long-term gilts, or government bonds, posted small gains. But shorter-term issues edged lower.   Traders said the increase in British base rates had little effect because it had been anticipated in the aftermath of West Germany's recent increase in its repo rate. The increase was seen as a tightening in monetary policy in response to rising inflationary fears.   Most gains in gilts were made before the rate increase was announced and the increases were confined largely to the long end of the market, where inflationary fears are the most rampant.   The benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007 rose 7/32 to 117 21/32 to yield 9.49%. Among shorter-term issues, the Treasury's 11 3/4% issue due 1991 declined 2/32 to 105 6/32 to yield 9.40%, while the Treasury's 12% issue of 1995 declined 3/32 to 111 11/32 to yield 9.62%.</TEXT></DOC>
