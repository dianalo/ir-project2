As recently as last year, high-school history textbooks made nomention of dictator Josef Stalin's mass repressions. In 1989, thenew 10th-grade text states: ``Tentative estimates put the totalnumber of deaths in the repressions at about 40 million people.''   Glasnost, or openness, is rapidly rewriting Soviet history,sometimes faster than the Soviets can rewrite their children'stextbooks.   In June 1988, educators were ordered to cancel secondary schoolhistory exams because the tests would have required parroting ofCommunist Party dogma at odds with dramatic disclosures in thepress about the nation's recent past.   A prodigious effort began to rewrite Soviet history, and theeditors' work has begun appearing in classrooms.   The inclusion of Solzhenitsyn's work on a recommended readinglist is one sign of how quickly barriers are falling. A Sovietmagazine published the first portions of the documentary study inAugust. The full book has yet to appear.   A teacher's guide produced by the Moscow city educationcommittee charges that Stalin imprisoned millions of people becausehis crash industrialization program required that workers move toharsh environments.   Since there weren't enough volunteers, ``there appeared dozensof camps in the necessary places with hundreds of thousands ofprisoners,'' the guide says.   Inmates ``were turned into a mute labor force, requiringpractically no expenses, easily commanded and easily transferred,''it continues. At least 5 million people had their propertyconfiscated and were shipped off to Siberia and other remote places.   The book admits that ``whole regions died'' in famines duringthe early 1930s, caused by Stalin's forced collectivization offarms.   ``We don't know the exact number of deaths caused by theauthorities,'' the book says. ``Western scientists estimate 3million to 10 million people.''   Back in 1974, when Leonid Brezhnev was in power, a 10th-gradehistory text described the 1930s as a period of rapidindustrialization, rife with victories for labor.   The revised text blames Stalin, once credited with saving themotherland from Nazi annihilation, for making disastrous mistakes.   It says Stalin ``repressed'' _ a word used to mean imprisoned orkilled in the purges _ those who favored preparation for war,including five directors of army intelligence. It notes that onJune 22, 1941, when German troops invaded, many Soviet borderguards had the day off.   ``This mistake in calculating the time of the attack resulted ingreat loss of life,'' the textbook says.   The new book's candor in describing the purges and the terribleprice exacted by Stalin's belief that Adolf Hitler would neverattack the Soviet Union has startled adults, accustomed to dullrecitations of the party line.   ``If they wrote this five years ago, they would be in a camp,''said one former political prisoner, who asked not to be identifiedby name.   But teaching the real past still poses risks. Just last spring,according to the ex-prisoner's son, a civics teacher disappearedfrom his eighth-grade class after using recent magazine articles toteach about Stalin's repressions, even though officials had advisedteachers to do so.   ``He was the first guy who wanted us to really know the historyof our country,'' the 15-year-old said. ``The new teacher went backto rote memorizing.''   The rush to rewrite history has left today's high schoolstudents with a strange mixture of old and new texts.   ``Our journalists are continuously publishing new informationabout our history, but textbooks must be finished and released forschool,'' said Alexander Samsonov, history editor for the Educationpublishing house in Moscow.   That leaves him in the difficult position of figuring out whichreports are sufficiently supported both by facts and politiciansfor presentation to students, he said.   The new 10th-grade history text walks a fine line betweenWestern and traditional Soviet versions of the events thattriggered World War II.   What the Baltic republics consider a Soviet invasion of theircountries is explained with the euphemism, ``Soviet power wasrestored in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.''   The book does not state that the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pactof 1939 divided the Baltics and Poland into Soviet and Nazi spheresof influence, as a Kremlin official only recently admitted.   But the textbook does say the treaty ``was unjust because ittook place behind the back of the Polish people.''   The textbook acknowledges ``abuses of power and violations oflaw'' in the Baltics, but doesn't explain that tens of thousands ofBaltic residents were deported to camps in the frozen wastelands ofSiberia and the far north. Estonia's government is now consideringpaying damages to the victims and their families.</TEXT></DOC>
