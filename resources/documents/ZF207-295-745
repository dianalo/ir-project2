Morris, supposedly wrote it so that it wouldspecifically infect Sun and VAX systems.andP;  Fortunately, it wasn't the type ofworm that could destroy files, but it did force system managers all over theUnited States to take their systems off-line for at least a few hours forexpensive &quot;disinfection.&quot;andM;The Scores virus gets its name from an invisible file that it creates in theSystem Folder on a Macintosh.andP;  Neither this virus nor, for that matter, theMorris worm was supposed to escape into the general population.andP;  The problem,of course, is that both bugs did just that.andP;  The Scores virus still rears itsugly head from time to time.andM;What can we do about viruses?andP;  For starters, we must all take safetyprecautions.andP;  Organizations should have someone inspect any software broughtin from outside.andP;  Unknown software should be quarantined, and users who snubthe rules should not be permitted to hook up to any network.andP;  Companiesshould also put stringent testing regimens into effect and stress mandatoryclasses on viruses for all users.andM;On your own system, you should write-protect all master disks, make copies ofthose disks, and work with the copies only.andP;  You should always haveuninfected originals on hand.andP;  And viruses certainly offer a compellingreason to do regular backups!andM;Many corporate sites think they're immune to viruses because they permit onlyloyal company employees to access host processors.andP;  What these organizationsdon't consider is that a loyal employee might use the host CPU to dial out toa network such as the Internet, which hooks into the Department of Defense'sArpanet and other major networks.andP;  Designed to foster communications amongresearchers, the Internet is open to a multitude of facilities and users.andO;This makes the Internet very difficult to control if attacked by a virus, asthe Morris incursion demonstrates.andM;But viruses may not sabotage our computer systems as badly in the future ifthe Software Development Council, (415) 854-7219, has its way.andP;  Thiscoalition of six regional trade organizations has formed a combineddeveloper/legal task force to combat software viruses and assist legislatorsin becoming more informed about the relevant technology.andM;Viruses can easily and unknowingly be brought in from a software bulletinboard.andP;  Fortunately, most sysops have become pretty good at diagnosing anderadicating viruses in the software on their boards.andP;  Moreover, many publicbulletin boards are chock-full of information on combating virus programs Macboards, in particular, are a great source of antiviral programs that guardagainst contamination on your desk top.andM;Some people have gone so far as to publish the source code of a virus thatthey were able to obtain, but watch out: Published virus code only provides atemplate of a virus for a would-be criminal &quot;genetic engineer.&quot;andM;Reader ForumandM;Mindy Patterson, a secondary school teacher in Phoenix, Arix., asked aboutobtaining a grammar checker for PC clones.andM;Right Writer from RightSoft, (800) 992-0244, should fit the bill.andP;  It's astyle checker as well as a grammar checker, and works very nicely with mostword processors.andP;  It flags grammatical errors rather than merely notingpotential trouble.andP;  RightWriter also includes a program called RightWords,which lets you choose words to be flagged as jargon, colloquial or misused.andM;Send questions or information to me care of Digital Review, Prudential Tower,Suite 1390, 800 Boylston St., Boston, MA 02199, or call me at (619) 293-1130.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
