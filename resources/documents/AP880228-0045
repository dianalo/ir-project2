Prominent clergy told their congregations that the church wouldbecome more active in opposing apartheid now that the governmenthas banned political activity by 18 opposition groups. They calledfor a church-led campaign against the latest crackdown.   ``We have no option but to engage in activities that now areprohibited,'' said the Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of theSouth African Council of Churches.   ``No matter what the consequences, we will continue to seek theunbanning of democratic organizations and the transfer of powerfrom the white minority to all the people,'' Chikane told about 200people at Central Methodist Church in Johannesburg.   The government on Wednesday banned the 18 black-led groups frompolitical activity and placed restrictions on the activities of 18senior black leaders.   Church groups weren't included in the crackdown andtheoretically still were free to engage in resistance campaigns,but most forms of peaceful protest still are banned under existingregulations.   The outlawing of the country's leading anti-apartheid groups,most of them affiliated with the United Democratic Front coalition,is viewed as a clear sign that the government intends to maintain ahard line against all political opponents.   Rev. Peter Storey, a prominent white minister and anti-apartheidactivist, compared the crackdown with the government's 1960decision to outlaw the African National Congress guerrilla groupand the 1977 banning of 18 black political organizations.   ``To do a third time what has failed twice is rank stupidity,''Storey said at the Central Methodist service. ``What the governmenthas done flies in the face of history, exhibits a moral bankruptcyand is a declaration of war on peace.''   In Cape Town, Tutu said he would defy government laws heconsiders unjust.   ``Apartheid is evil, apartheid is immoral and apartheid isun-Christian,'' Tutu told about 200 people at the BonteheuwelAnglican Church.   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, described the SouthAfrican government as ``illegitimate'' and suggested church leaderswould initiate a civil disobedience campaign in coming days.   None of the church leaders specified what activities they wouldengage in, but there are several ongoing resistance campaigns thatwere led by groups now restricted. Those include rent boycotts inblack townships, keeping track of dissidents under policedetention, and a push to restructure black education.   Church services to express opposition the government's measuresalso were held in Pretoria and Durban, the country's other leadingcities.   Under South Africa's apartheid policies of racial segregation,the nation's 5 million whites maintain political and economiccontrol over 26 million blacks, who have no vote in nationalaffairs.</TEXT></DOC>
