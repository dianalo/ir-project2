The old aid program, which expired last Friday, allowed theadministration to use the $17.7 million package only for food,clothing, medical services and shelter.   The new $27 million, six-month package signed into law byPresident Reagan on Saturday calls for assistance in the same fourareas, but the word ``only'' has been deleted. That will permit theadministration greater flexibility in how the money is spent.   In signing the $14.3 billion foreign aid bill, Reagan criticizedwhat he said was a minimal amount of humanitarian aid for theContras.   U.S. officials, speaking only on condition they not be named,said they envision U.S.-sponsored ``skills training'' in areasranging from radio maintenance to record keeping, human rights andhealth care.   The officials said such programs should boost the morale of thethousands of rebels who are camped along the Honduran-Nicaraguanborder.   Many of the rebels flocked to these camps from inside Nicaraguaover the past six months to take advantage of the assistanceprograms being carried out in the border area by the Agency forInternational Development.   No deliveries were made inside Nicaragua because agreement couldnot be reached with the Sandinista government on an acceptabledelivery system.   The officials said they expect opposition to the proposedtraining programs from some members of Congress.   The prospects for a renewal of military aid for the rebels arenot good. The aid package, initially approved by the Senate inAugust, authorized the release of $16.5 million in stockpiledmilitary equipment under certain conditions.   But the funds would require congressional approval beforeadjournment of the current session, and there is only about a weekleft before members go home. The next session of Congress begins inJanuary.   There has been no attempt by the administration to trigger avote on release of the funds.   Congress rejected an administration military aid request on Feb.3 and the formal cutoff of weapons deliveries to the Contrasoccurred on Feb. 29.   The majority of the Contras have since resettled along theborder area, faced with the prospect that their principalbenefactor, the United States, can no longer be relied on to aid intheir quest to topple the Sandinista government.   According to officials, the Contras have some ammunition leftbut are no match for the Sandinistas, who received an estimated$400 million in military equipment from the Soviet Union during thefirst eight months of the year.</TEXT></DOC>
