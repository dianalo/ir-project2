Dennis Kloske, undersecretary of commerce for exportadministration, said that freeing these products fromunnecessary paperwork would &quot;enable U.S. manufacturers tocompete on an equal footing with foreign competitors whodon't face any exporting constraints.&quot; The order will takeeffect tomorrow.</LP><TEXT>   The department's latest move to liberalize technologytrade within the western bloc covers hard-disk drives with acapacity of up to 45 megabytes of memory. Nearly all personalcomputers are equipped with such built-in data-storagedevices. The department estimates that U.S. shipments ofthese products were valued at close to $500 million lastyear.   The department decided to ease licensing requirements forthese products after determining that drives of comparablequality are being widely traded by countries that don'tparticipate in export controls adopted by the U.S. and itsallies.   The department said it will continue to require exportlicenses for shipment of these products to the Soviet Unionand Eastern European countries, pending changes in exportrules by the U.S. and its allies.</TEXT></DOC>
