Reports that the U.S. and Japan tentatively scheduled a Feb. 7 meeting of finance ministers of the so-called Group of Five -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France -- sparked expectations of a stronger dollar.    &quot;I'm sure if (an agreement) did come about, it would be to prop up the dollar. That's the only reason to have a meeting,&quot; said J. Steven Stekly, a trader at Bank of Boston.    As of last night, however, the five governments hadn't made any final decisions on a meeting.    It was the Group of Five, or G-5, that agreed in September 1985 to coordinate heavy central-bank selling of dollars to accelerate the dollar's decline. The aim then was to help the U.S. reduce its huge trade deficit. A weaker dollar makes imports more costly to Americans and U.S. exports more competitive abroad.    Since the plan at the first G-5 meeting was implemented, the value of the dollar has declined 36% against the West German mark and the Japanese yen, and officials of both countries, where export industries have been hurt by the dollar's drop, have expressed interest in action to stop its slide.    At the opening of the new session of parliament in Tokyo yesterday, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said Japan &quot;must continue to respond appropriately to the yen's appreciation with coordinated policies.&quot; Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament that Japan intends to try to keep the yen-dollar rate stable with continued intervention and through policy coordination with other countries.    U.S. officials have expressed less concern about the dollar's decline. Administration officials said President Reagan yesterday expressed satisfaction with current U.S. policy on exchange rates, in a meeting with Treasury Secretary James Baker. The officials said no one in the administration wants to see &quot;too fast or too precipitous a drop&quot; in the dollar's value, but added that there is a recognition that the dollar probably will continue to decline gradually unless West Germany and Japan help correct the current global trade imbalance.    Traders said they remained fundamentally bearish toward the dollar but were cautious about selling much below current levels because of concern about central-bank intervention. Those concerns were fed by the West German Bundesbank's intervention at the Frankfurt foreign-exchange fixing yesterday. The central bank bought a modest $22.9 million.    &quot;That's keeping the market a little nervous,&quot; said Daniel E. Holland, a trader at Discount Corp. of New York.    Added Peter Rogers, vice president and chief foreign-exchange dealer at Banca Nazionale Dell'Agricoltura, New York, &quot;We're back to the situation where no one wants to take on the central banks.&quot;    Meanwhile, traders still expect the Bank of Japan to cut its discount rate soon, but they said such action probably would lend little support to the dollar. Also yesterday, the Japanese government adopted a target of 3.5% inflation-adjusted growth in the year beginning April 1, up from its 3% target for the current fiscal year.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8242 marks, up from 1.8183 Friday. The dollar also firmed to 152.80 yen, from 152.68.    The British pound eased to $1.5231, from $1.5245, while the Canadian dollar climbed to 74.11 U.S. cents, from 73.61 U.S. cents.    Trading in New York was quieted by a heavy snowfall.    In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday the dollar fell against the Japanese currency to 152.60 yen from 152.80 in New York yesterday afternoon.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $6.10 an ounce to $411 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 3.4 million ounces.    ---                       CURRENCY RATES                          New York    Home Mkt.    New York                            Mon.        Mon.
