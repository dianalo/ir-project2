The negotiator, Ambassador C. Paul Robinson, told the HouseForeign Affairs Committee that both U.S. and Soviet negotiatorsbelieve treaties limiting the size of underground nuclear weaponstests and of nuclear tests for peaceful purposes can be ready forratification by the end of this year.   ``There is a sense of history among those involved'' in theGeneva negotiations, the second round of which ended Tuesday, saidRobinson. ``None of them believed this could be possible.''   On their final day of talks, the two sides exchanged historicaldata on yields of past nuclear tests, seismic recordings andassociated geological information, he said.   The two sides negotiated the Threshold Test Ban Treaty in 1974and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty in 1976, but neither hasbeen ratified. The Geneva talks have been aimed at reaching newverification agreements on the two pacts so they can finally beratified.   The treaties prohibit nuclear tests of greater than 150 kilotons.   Robinson also said plans are far along for a historic jointverification experiment to be conducted by the two sides in Augustand September. The experiment, agreed to during the Washingtonsummit last December, calls for each side to measure a testexplosion of the other using on-site monitoring equipment.   The U.S. test at the Nevada test site will take place in August,and the Soviet test at Semipalatinsk about a month later, he said.   During the hearing, committee members sparred withadministration officials over whether the administration hasabandoned a longstanding U.S. policy of seeking an eventual ban onall nuclear testing.   ``For 43 years we have experienced a need to test,'' said Maj.Gen. William F. Burns, director of the Arms Control and DisarmamentAgency. ``I see nothing to change this need at the present.''   Burns said the U.S. policy is that testing must continue so longas the United States relies on nuclear weapons as a deterrent, aposition which drew fire from Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa.   Administrations from Eisenhower through Carter have held thatthe United States would agree to a comprehensive test ban if theSoviet Union would accept on-site inspection, Leach said, somethingthe Soviets have now done.   ``For the first time in the history of arms control, the UnitedStates is ceding the high ground to the Soviet Union,'' he said.``I am appalled that we are not pursuing the big apple ... Thisadministration has backed off.''   Burns responded: ``I am not particularly persuaded (by the fact)that the comprehensive test ban has been part of the rhetoric ofthe past six administrations, simply because times change. Myprimary concern is the security of the United States.''</TEXT></DOC>
