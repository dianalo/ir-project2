 Agrowing number of third-party developers are joining the fray as well,providing software for OCR, image ending, fax, and image databases.andM;This dramatic growth came from both the East and the West.andP;  The Japanese haveimproved scanning technology so that it can transmit information by thepage--the only practical way to handle their iconographic language.andP;  Andthere's no doubt that the Japanese dominate the hardware market: Ricoh,Canon, Microtek, and other Japanese manufacturers produce over 95 percent ofscanners sold in the United States.andM;America contributed the other market.andP;  Spurred on by the Apple Macintosh andby growing demands from the MS-DOS side, desktop publishing helped createtoday's image-hungry market.andP;  According to the market research firmDataquest, scanner sales have increased an average of 250 percent annuallyfrom 1984 to 1987, with another 200 percent increase for 1988.andP;  The number ofvendors seems to be quickly increasing, and the list of sophisticatedfeatures is growing.andP;  In just 3 years scanner manufacturers have doubledresolution, added gray-scale capability, and standardized file formats,creating a wealth of possibilities that are just now being explored.andM;FIERCE COMPETITIONandM;Desktop publishing also has made OCR more popular than ever.andP;  Fiercecompetition among the big players, in fact, has improved performance, drivendown costs, and produced some real breakthroughs.andM;Four years ago, successfully scanning typeset documents would've cost over$40,000 and required a minicomputer.andP;  Today, your PC can have similarcapability for under $5,000.andP;  The new bred of OCR scans columns in one pass,adds formatting codes, paginates, spell-checks, and produces nearly finishedfiles--all in the background.andP;  There is also a growing number of simple OCRsoftware packages for under $1,000 for typewritten documents, line listings,and spreadsheets.andM;The biggest trend to watch in 1989 is the rise of third-party OCR andimage-processing software.andP;  Jim Cavuoto, who publishes the Micro PublishingReport, has covered scanner and OCR developments for over 5 years.andP;  &quot;We nowhave scanners that serve as a platform for independent applications software,where you can choose applications that you need,&quot; he notes.andP;  &quot;There are imageapplications, OCR applications, and some PC fax boards with applicationsoftware.andP;  Having independent applications is the key to the growth of thescanner market.andP;  As third-party developers come out and support scanningengines, you'll see an exponential growth in the types of things you can dowith a scanner.&quot;andM;EVOLVING APPLICATIONSandM;The predominant use for scanners remains desktop publishing.andP;  According toDataquest, about 25 percent of the scanners sold have OCR capability, whichsuggests most buyers are concerned primarily with image capture.andP;  And whilesome scanners are also used in the CAD markets, these systems are usually toospecialized for general office use.andM;One growth area for scanners may be facsimile transmission, or fax.andP;  Datacopyhas offered a scanner-fax system for 2 years, and other vendors like TheComplete PC offer scanner interfaces for fax.andP;  Yet the much-ballyhooedmarriage between scanners and PC-based fax has not yet translated into bigsales.andM;The other potential scanner market that holds promise comprises imagestorage/retrieval systems, which store documents as picture-pages instead ofas a string of textual characters.andP;  Championed by products like ATandamp;T'sOverview Scanner, imaging documents lets you store not only the textualcontent of a page: any pictures, page format, even marginal notation can bestored in this fashion as well.andM;Image storage/retrieval represents the future for scanning on PCs.andP;  Enablingtechnologies like improved data compression, read-write optical disks, fasterretrieval systems, and high-resolution displays are still a few years off.andM;HOW THEY WORKandM;Most scanners bounce light off a page and measure how much light comes back.andO;White reflects almost all the light, black absorbs most of it, and variousshades of gray reflect light in proportion to their density.andP;  Most scannersmeasure reflected light with a CCD (charge-coupled device), which sendsdifferent signals to the PC based on how much light is received.andP;  The varioussignals from the scanner are sent either to a co-processor or to the PC's ownCPU for processing.andP;  From there, what happens to the signals depends largelyon the application software.andM;With image processing, there are several choices.andP;  With line or bitonal art,there can be only two values: black or white.andP;  Engineering drawings,pen-and-ink sketches, blueprints, and the like fall into this category, andthe image processing is relatively straightforward.andM;Photographs and other kinds of continuous-tone images present anotherproblem.andP;  A simple black-and-white photo of your backyard barbecue may havemore than a million different values of gray.andP;  While these gray tones adddepth to the image and make it appear realistic, the processing powerrequired to get a million gray values is well beyond the PC's capabilities.andO;Even if you could process it, there is no output engine capable of showingthe full range of gray values; better output is often attained through aprocess known as dithering.andM;DITHERING ON THE JOBandM;Scanner manufacturers have taken two approaches to handling continuous-toneimages.andP;  The first is known as dithering.andP;  Gray values are measured,thresholded at specific values, then converted into a bitmap pattern based onthose values.andP;  The darker the gray, the denser the pattern.andP;  Ditheringremains the most common technique used for scanner output.andP;  It is usuallystored in the .PCX format (Z-Soft's PC Paintbrush), although some scannersalso use Dr.andP;  Halo's .PIC format or the GEM-compatible .IMG format.andM;Like all bitmaps, dithered images can be edited using a paint program, butthat's the extent of the manipulating capabilities.andP;  You can't scale imagesor manipulate image quality without altering every pixel.andP;  In many ways, adithered image is the digital equivalent of an instant photograph.andM;GRAY-SCALING SCANNERSandM;The other method is called gray scaling and is relatively new to the PC.andO;Gray scaling is the digital equivalent of a photographic negative.andP;  Insteadof converting gray values to a fixed pattern, the scanner software can storegray values with the file.andP;  The most common file format for gray-scale imagesis called TIFF (tagged image file format).andM;The amount of gray-scale information depends largely on the scanner'scapability, and on what you intend to do with it.andP;  Unlike the dithered image,gray-scale images are not given any specific pattern until they're printedout.andP;  You can store and manipulate a large number of gray values, but much ofthe information may be lost if you print them on a low-resolution device (seethe sidebar &quot;More Than a Black-and-White Decision&quot;).andM;Some of the scanner manufacturers aren't willing to hostage gray-scale outputto third-party hardware--at least not completely.andP;  Microtek intends toannounce a coprocessor board for the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet Series II thatit claims will deliver magazine-quality gray scales.andP;  Intel has alreadyannounced a similar product, the Visual Edge System.andM;As output improves, the importance of gray-scale-manipulation softwareincreases (see the sidebar &quot;Brushing Up Your Gray (Scales&quot;).andP;  Withimage-manipulation software, gray-scale images offer desktop publishers theequipment of a digital darkroom.andM;SCANNING AND OCRandM;In the case of OCR, signals for gray levels are converted to either black orwhite, based on a threshold set by the application software.andP;  Mostlower-priced OCR software uses a scanning method known as matrix matching, orfont recognition.andP;  Character images are isolated, placed in a fixed matrix,and compared against tables of known images.andP;  When there's a match, an ASCIIcharacter is produced.andP;  Unrecognized characters can be flagged, or the OCRosftware can be instructed to make a &quot;best gues.&quot;andP;  Some software can even be&quot;taught&quot; to recognize new or low-contrast characters either by your editingthe original character table or adding an exceptions character table.andM;Matrix matching works best with monospaced characters, as found ontypewriters, line printers, dot matrix printers, and letter-quality printers.andO;Although some matrix matching claims to work with proportionally spacedcharacters, this usually means proportional output from IMB Selectrics andearlier-model daisy wheel printers.andP;  When shopping for lower-priced OCRsoftware, expect it to be matrix matching.andM;FEATURE EXTRACTIONandM;Scanning books, newspapers, magazines, and other professional-qualitydocuments, however, demands a more powerful recognition technology.andP;  Featureextraction, also known as feature recognition, is based on the principle thateach letter has distinct features regardless of the font; the letter R, forexample, has the same basic features whether it's printed in Times Roman,Garamond, Franklin Gothic, or Helvetica.andM;Feature extraction software examines the scanned image and then builds a listof features.andP;  When a set of features describes a specific character--in thecase of an R, for example, an upright stroke with a bowl at the top and atail running from the bowl down on right--the software responds by generatingthat character.andM;Features extraction is independent of both the font and character spacing andso can be used on almost any kind of printed material.andP;  But decorative fonts,deliberate distortions, and other typographic touches may cause problems.andO;Very tight letter-spacing and kerning (adjusting space between letters) stillpose the greatest stumbling blocks to feature extraction.andM;Some OCR manufacturers have gone well beyond character recognition to includedocument format information.andP;  The scanners from the Kurzweil division ofXerox Imaging Systems and from Calera Recognition Systems (formerly palantir)can scan multicolumn documents in one pass; double-sided documents can bescanned, turned over, scanned again, and then paginated.andP;  Tabular materialcan be scanned, recognized, and formatted for specific applications.andP;  Andselected scanning can be used with databases, spreadsheets, and faxdocuments.andM;A SYSTEM FOR YOUandM;The only downside to this wealth of image and OCR features is having tochoose what you need.andP;  Even with falling prices, most desktop scanningsystems start at $1,500, and you can spend 10 times that amount with littletrouble.andM;Once you've narrowed down the amount you can spend, you have to consider howyou'll use the scanner.andP;  Don't worry about resolution or gray scales untilyou've determined the production metrics: Who will use the scanner?andP;  Howoften, and for what existing or future applications?andP;  What about the physicallayout--desktop versus hand-'eld?andP;  Is the scanner for personal or public use?andO;Who will manage and maintain it?andM;Carefully consider the type of scanner you buy.andP;  If you want one that's thedigital equivalent of a photocopier, flatbed scanners have a definiteadvantage.andP;  They are preferred for accurate alignment of detailed linedrawings, and you can copy pictures from books and magazines withoutdestroying them.andP;  Best of all, flatbed scanners don't jam pages.andM;There are several new flatbed models that the similar to photo enlargers: theimage is placed on a copyboard and scanned from above.andP;  The copyboardscanners are intended for scanning both pages and objects, but your successin 3-D will depend largely on the scanner's depth of field.andP;  In some cases,copyboard scanners require special lighting consideratins; you may even needto put your unit in a special imaging room that will allow you to controllighting.andM;Roller-feed scanners with built-in page feeders are usually preferable forOCR and fax, particularly in an office with a limited need for imagescanning.andP;  In this case, take pains to check over paper handling carefully.andO;How easy is it to clear a paper jam, and can anyone do it?andP;  Also check to seehow software handles jams, misreads, and other hardware errors.andM;You can get the best of both worlds by purchasing a flatbed scanner with asheet feeder, but think hard about this &quot;all-purpose&quot; option.andP;  OCR and faxcan take a lot of time, and that may frustrate artists who need quick scanson demand.andP;  Prices have fallen to the point where it's possible tocost-justify two scanners in a medium-size production center.andP;  A lower-pricedscanner with sheet feeder can be attached to an AT as the text workstate,complete with OCR and in-board fax.andP;  The higher-priced imaging scanner can betied directly to a production PC.andM;In a budy office where the scanner doubles as the fax system, your hardwareshould be particularly rugged.andP;  Looke for easy-to-load trays and clearlylabeled controls.andP;  Check the paper path: find out what it takes to clear apaper jam, and ask how much damage a staple will do.andP;  Examine theconstruction, particularly of the paper trays, and make sure that thehardware will be able to take some abuse.andM;Once you've settled the physical layout and operation, you have most of theinformation you need for evaluating application software.andP;  Systems that'll beused by a number of people need software that's relatively easy to use.andO;Automated OCR and fax should be a primary concern here, and if imaging is lowon your priority list, a dithered pattern may be all the imaging manipulationyou need.andM;Choosing gray-scaling software and other image-manipulation utilities willdepend largely on the kind of publishing you're doing.andP;  Check your publishingsoftware to see what kinds of graphics file formats it accepts, and then seehow much memory you'll need to handle tem.andP;  Ventura Publisher 2.0, forexample, can display gray-scale TIFF files, but you may need to hve 2MB ofexpanded memory available to use this feature.andP;  See whether the publishingsoftware allows you to manipulate the image before printing and, again,dtermine your system requirements before you make a decision.andM;THE REVIEWSandM;To help in making a more-informed decision, PC Magazine reviews 21 scannersrepresenting both the image scanning and OCR markets.andP;  Included are productsfrom AVR, ATandamp;T, Canon, Chinon, CompuScan, DEST, Hewelett-Packard, Microtek,Mitsubishi, Panasonic, Pentax, Ricoh, Saba, Shape, and Xerox Imaging Systems'Datacopy and Kurzweil divisions.andM;But still there were some notable no-shows.andP;  Because this review focuses onblack-and-white desktop units, for instance, no color products from Howtek orSharp are represented.andP;  Abaton, IBM, Totec, and The Complete PC were unableto make our deadline for receiving products.andP;  Compugraphic, Kyocera, andIntelligent Optics were still putting finishing touches on new scanners atpresstime.andP;  E.I.T.andP;  and Princeton Graphics' existing scanners have beenreviewed before (see &quot;Scanners Take Off,&quot; PC Magazine, October 13, 1987).andO;And while the CDP 9000 from Colera is not reviewed among the others here, itsadd-on board/software combination, True Scan, has been included in a separatesidebar (see &quot;Supercharging Your Scanner&quot;).andM;What remains is a wealth of possibility.andP;  The big names in scannerengines--Canon and Ricoh--are now competing with Hewlett-Packard, Mitsubishi,and Panasonic.andP;  The &quot;Gang of Four&quot; that pioneered the Americanmarket--datacopy, DEST, Kurzweil, and Microtek--are here in force.andP;  So arenewer players like Chinon, Pentax, and Saba Technologies, the latter of whichis already a presence in the hand scanner market.andM;Besides showing you what features each scanner offers, these reviews show youhow the players in the scanner game have changed to meet the market.andP;  Thereare now some big players, and the shakeout of startups has settled down.andP;  Theresult is a more robust product offering than ever before, with the right mixof hardware and software features to fit almost any imaging or OCRapplication for PCs today.andM;The maturing market scanner reduces the consumer's risk.andP;  It adds stabilityto the emerging third-party applications.andP;  As software catches up with thehardware's potential, PC users will realize just how far they've come, andthe almost unlimited potential for the future.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
