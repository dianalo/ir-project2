(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The company that created the Love Canaltoxic-waste dump ignored its own employees' warnings and sold thefilled-in site to a school board without explaining the dangers, astate lawyer charged Wednesday.   Also at the start of a trial over liability for cleanup costs,the president of that company's parent apologized for the problemsthe dump created. But a company lawyer argued it didn't hideconditions at the site.   Hooker Chemicals andamp; Plastics Corp. built the dump in 1942 andsold the land to the Niagara Falls school board in 1953.   Toxic chemicals eventually leaked into basements and backyardsof a middle-class neighborhood built on the dump and made LoveCanal a symbol of America's toxic-waste problems in the late 1970s.About 2,500 people fled their homes.   The state is seeking $250 million in punitive damages againstOccidental Chemical Corp., which bought Hooker in 1968. The statecontends Hooker recklessly failed to take care of the dangers atthe site or warn others about them.   The company argues that the federal, state and Niagara Fallsmunicipal governments and the city's school board share liability.   Two former Love Canal residents were called as the state's firstwitnesses.   Peter T. Bulka Jr., a former Niagara Falls policeman, told howchildren on a Little League team he coached discovered``volcanoes'' in the outfield of a baseball diamond built on thedump.   ``We found two places where the ground was mounded up and stuffwas spewing up from the middle,'' Bulka said.   Timothy Moriarty, who grew up in one of the first houses builtin the area, said he remembered seeing at least two fires at thedump in the early 1950s, throwing flames 10 to 20 feet in the air.   He also said city garbage trucks occasionally used the dump, aswell as Hooker.   Eugene Martin-Leff, the state's lead trial lawyer, chargedHooker's own employees warned of a ``quagmire'' at the site andurged it not be sold to the school board because of the 21,800 tonsof buried toxic chemicals.   ``Conscience told Hooker to safeguard this dangerous place sopeople could not come in contact with the dangerous poisons insideit,'' Martin-Leff said in his opening argument to U.S. DistrictJudge John T. Curtin, who is hearing the case without a jury.   ``But the narrow voice of self-interest said, `Don't spend moneyto install a fence,' ... and later, `Go ahead and sell the site soother people can take care of it,' '' Martin-Leff said.   Thomas H. Truitt, Occidental's lawyer, argued that Hookeradhered to the standards of the day when it built the dump andshould not be judged through the ``hauntingly seductive lens ofhindsight.''   ``The central issue in this case is not whether all thedecisions are correct. Many were; some were not,'' Truitt said.``But, (the issue is) whether we ... can go back to the 1940s and1950s and place these decisions in the context in which they weremade.''   Truitt said the company had given the school board full noticethat dangerous chemicals were buried beneath the property when theboard asked about buying it for construction of an elementaryschool. He said the company included that warning in the deed.   ``The deed says `May cause injury or death,' '' Truitt said. ``Ibelieve `death' is fair notice to any person.''   In fact, the deed does not use the words ``may cause injury ordeath.'' But it does say ``waste products resulting from themanufacturing of chemicals'' are buried on the site and absolvesHooker of liability for injury, death or property damage theycause.   The trial is expected to last at least two years. Opening daybrought nearly 100 spectators to the federal courthouse. Thirty-twolawyers and aides packed the counsel tables and spilled over intothe jury box.   Evidence includes up to 1 million pages of documents. A computerwas installed in the courtroom to keep track of all the paperwork.   Before opening arguments, Occidental Chemical President RogerHirl apologized for Love Canal. ``We do feel badly about it,'' hetold reporters. ``We apologize to all those who suffered because ofit.''   Occidental does not dispute that Hooker dumped 21,800 tons ofdioxin, pesticide byproducts and other chemicals, some of themhighly toxic, in an abandoned canal bed dug in the 1890s byentrepreneur William Love.   The Dallas-based company paid $20 million in 1984 to settle aseparate lawsuit brought by 1,345 former Love Canal residents.</TEXT></DOC>
