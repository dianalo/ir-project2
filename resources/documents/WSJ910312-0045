The organizations hope the guidelines can head offexpected legislation in Congress that would make accountantstougher watchdogs over business. Some prominent members ofthe sponsoring organizations earlier said the initial draftof the proposal was too weak to do that. Since then, theorganizations have been working to meet some of thesecriticisms.</LP><TEXT>   The guidelines focus on internal-control systems tosafeguard assets and improve financial reporting in suchareas as corporate ethics, risk assessment and monitoringwhether such guidance is followed by management, the fiveorganizations say.   Vincent O'Reilly, deputy chairman of Coopers andamp; Lybrand, amajor accounting firm which compiled the proposed guidelines,said they contain &quot;tools&quot; in the form of checklists to helpcompanies improve their internal controls.   &quot;There is no standard or cookbook approach to evaluateinternal control and companies will have to modify thesetools based on their assessment of what needs to be done,&quot;Mr. O'Reilly said.   Gaylen Larson, group vice president and chief accountingofficer of Household International Inc. and chairman of anadvisory council to the group, says that the group wantsinput from business, government and academia before issuingthe final guidelines later this year.   The organizations issuing the proposal are the AmericanAccounting Association, the American Institute of CertifiedAccountants, the Financial Executives Institute, theInstitute of Internal Auditors and the National Associationof Accountants.   Early reaction suggested that even the revised guidelinesface controversy. For instance, critics said the initialdraft inadequately addressed the faulty financial reportingand management fraud rampant over the past few years inthrifts and banks that have collapsed. Some prominent membersof the five organizations said that the proposal to bereleased today still fails to meet that criticism.   A spokesman for U.S. Rep. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), who haslong lambasted accountants for faulty auditing of financialdata, declined comment on the proposed guidelines untilthey're released today.   Rep. Wyden has said that if the proposed guidelines aren'tstrong enough to prevent financial fraud, he wouldreintroduce in Congress this year a bill to force outsideauditors to give earlier warnings about troubled companies toregulators. Under current securities laws, accounting firmscan only quit an audit if they believe management isn'tproperly preventing fraud, but they aren't required to tellregulators about the fraud.   Robert May, chairman of the five-organization group, saysthat while fraudulent financial reporting and &quot;accountingsurprises&quot; can't be eliminated entirely, the group believesthe guidelines will reduce such incidents.</TEXT></DOC>
