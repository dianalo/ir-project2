This study is also aimed at characterising the Minestone environmentso that possible causes of any degradation can be identified. The fieldtrial is being supplemented by a series of laboratory studies in whichthe influence of various fill conditions on the durability of specimensof metal reinforcement buried in them is being assessed. The conditionsbeing investigated include the influence of fill type, burial time, compaction,moisture content, temperature, standing water, flowing water, water tablefluctuations and the influence of drainage layer. The types of fill usedin this study include a number of Minestones, burnt shales, pulverisedfuel ash, gravel, chalk and limestone. The effect that any corrosionmay have on the mechanical properties of the metal and non-metal reinforcementspecimens is being assessed by strength loss measurements. In additionthe degree of moisture uptake within the non-metal specimens is beingdetermined. The rates and type of attack, that the metal specimens suffer,are being assessed by weight and thickness loss measurements and by examinationby microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Within the laboratory studies, therates and type of attack are also being continually monitored by computerisedelectrochemical techniques. These include electrochemical noise, andzero resistance ammetry. So far, the corrosion data produced by the electrochemicaltechniques correlated well with that produced by the other methods. 15refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
