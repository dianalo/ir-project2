More specifically, it involves preparationof TiO/sub 2/ films by sputtering and evaluating their physicochemicalcharacteristics primarily as they relate to the behaviour of the filmsas photoanodes. Impedance, photoelectrochemical, and photoconductionproperties of TiO/sub 2/ films sputtered in pure O/sub 2/ onto heatedsubstrates have been determined as a function of O/sub 2/ pressure duringsputtering, film thickness, Pt overcoating, and cathodic treatment. Thecapacitance data before cathodic treatment are of the form expected.The capacitance is essentially independent of potential, while for potentialsincreasingly cathodic of this value, the capacitance increases very rapidly.Cathodic treatment alters the impedance characteristics of the filmsbut leads to either no detectible change in their photoelectrochemicalproperties or to an increase in the photocurrent. In all cases thereis no change in the photo-onset potential for 0/sub 2/ evolution. Thereis no evidence that cathodic treatment leads to an increase in carrierconcentration. Pt overcoatings lead to anodic shifts of as much as 500mv. Cathodic treatment reduces this but does not change the impedencecharacteristics of the films. Freshly deposited films display photoconductivity.Thinner TiO/sub 2/ films show a somewhat more rapid rise in photocurrent.</TEXT></DOC>
