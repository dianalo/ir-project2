<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-36-0197 </DOCNO><TEXT>The superconducting energy gap Delta of high-Tc (90 K) YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub3}O(9-y) samples have been measured using tunneling and IR techniques.From the tunneling data, limits are placed on the reduced superconductingenergy gap: 2Delta/kBTc = 3.7-5.6. The tunneling gaps for a single-crystalsample are essentially the same if the tunneling tip is oriented eitherparallel or perpendicular to the CuO planes. The IR measurements givea smaller apparent gap. The origins of the differences between the IRand tunneling results are discussed. 29 references.</TEXT></DOC>
