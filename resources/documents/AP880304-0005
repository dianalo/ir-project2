He finished nearly three months ago but his findings have notbeen made public. The 14 patients, who were from the lower middleclass and ranged in age from 10 to 75, died two years ago from theeffects of tainted glycerol, a drug used to treat edema, orabnormal swelling.   Failure of the Maharashtra state government to release thereport has encouraged charges of slipshod manufacturing in India's16,000 drug companies and of government connivance in certifyingsubstandard drugs.   Chief Minister S.B. Chavan, the highest elected official ofMaharashtra, appointed Lentin as an investigating magistrate, butthe government is not obligated to prosecute on the basis of hisreport and the law does not require the report to be made public.   Lentin has pressed to have his findings made public. Chavan saidthe report will be presented to the legislature in March but hasnot given a date.   State governments certify drugs in India and 60 percent of theindustry is located in Maharashtra, a western state of which Bombayis the capital. Some other states also use the Maharashtragovernment laboratory for drug certification.   India's drug business is worth $1.8 billion a year and exportstotal $203 million of that, but there is no indication taintedproducts have been exported.   Most finished medicines go to the Soviet Union, Africa, theMiddle East and Southeast Asia. Bulk drugs also are sold tomanufacturers in Europe, the United States and Australia.   Indubhai A. Modi, president of the Indian Drug ManufacturersAssociation, said all companies are being blamed for the shoddywork done by a few small ones. According to figures presented toParliament, 14 percent of Indian drugs tested in 1986-87 weresubstandard.   Dr. Arun Bal, secretary of the Association for Consumer Actionon Safety and Health, says about 40,000 drug formulations areproduced in India, compared with 250 the World Health Organizationdescribes as essential.   ``Even the federal drug controller does not have an exactfigure,'' he said. ``This is ridiculous.''   The industry has been under attack since the 14 patients died inJanuary 1986 at the government-run Jamshetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital inBombay after being given glycerol contaminated with toxicdiethylene glycol.   Lentin's inquiry took testimony from 120 witnesses, and chargesof perjury were lodged against a former state health minister andfour other people. The investigation was conducted in public, not acommon practice in India, and unearthed facts embarrassing to stateofficials.   One was that the tainted glycerol originally was labeled``industrial glycerine,'' was substandard even for that categoryand went through several middlemen before being packed for hospitaluse.   Charges were made that employees of the state Food and DrugAdministration sometimes drank rather than tested samples of``country liquor,'' or illicit alcohol, sent for analysis.   There were complaints that agency employees demanded bribes. Adrug company owner, J. Sipahilalani, testified: ``Diwali comes morethan once every year for FDA officers.'' Diwali is an Indianholiday on which gifts are given.   The most sensational revelation, a list of 582 drugs declaredsubstandard but still on the market, became known as the FDA``murder book.'' Among the products were medicines used for typhoidand for serious diarrhea, often a cause of death among Indianinfants.   Included were drugs made by major Indian companies andsubsidiaries of multinational manufacturers: Parke Davis, RaptakosBrett, Rallis India, Roche Products and Lupin Laboratories.   Some companies whose products were listed described the defectsas minor and said they were caused by later handling, notmanufacturing.   V.H. Bhat, a spokesman for Roche, said chipped sugar coating onvitamin tablets ``could be due to mishandling by persons concernedor in transport.'' C.M. Hattangadi, president of Parke Davis-India,said some tablets found to contain less than the stated amount ofingredients were a ``stray case'' that ``could be due to highhumidity, high temperature or poor transport arrangements.''   State officials concede privately that proper procedures werenot followed in buying the tainted glycerol and said some FDAemployees have been suspended.   A senior doctor at Jamshetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital said a reportin 1972 recommended changes in hospital rules for buying and usingmedicines, but it was not implemented. He spoke on condition ofanonymity.   Drug makers say Indian drugs have been instrumental inincreasing the average life span of Indians from 32 years in 1947to 54 today, and that the more than 600 percent increase of exportsin a decade was achieved by quality.   ``We want spurious drug manufacturers prosecuted for murder,''said Modi, president of the manufacturers association, ``but for amicroscopic minority, why paint us all black?''</TEXT></DOC>
