Prior to our presentation of the questionnaire, wedecided to streamline this investigation because of the large number ofprograms involved, the large number of swine and pork producers in Canadaand our experience of previously examining most of the programs upon whichwe initiated. Toward this end, we decided to examine only swine and porkproducers in the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.These five provinces accounted for 92.5 percent of hogs slaughtered inCanada in 1987. On February 9, 1989, we presented a questionnaire to the Government ofCanada in Washington, DC, concerning petitioner's allegations. On February22, we received further subsidy allegations from petitioner. We chose toinitiate an investigation on all of the additional programs included inthat submission with the exception of the Saskatchewan Livestock Cash AdvanceProgram. This program is part of the Saskatchewan Financial Assistancefor Livestock and Irrigation Program, which was found to be not countervailable.[See, <T3>Live Swine From Canada: Preliminary Results of Countervailing DutyAdministrative Review, </T3>(53 FR 22189, June 14, 1988) and <T3>Live Swine From Canada: Final Results of Countervailing Duty AdministrativeReview, (Live Swine) </T3>(54 FR 651, January 9, 1989)]. The programs initiatedbased on the February 22nd allegations were the Special Canada Grains Program,the Feed Freight Assistance Program, the Alberta Crow Benefit Offset Programand the Newfoundland Swine Breeding Stations Program.On March 9, 1989, we received responses from the Government of Canada andthe Provincial Governments of Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, Quebec, and Saskatchewan.On March 10, we postponed the preliminary determination to no later thanMay 1, l989 pursuant to section 703(c)(1)(B) of the Act (54 FR 11024, March16, 1989). On April 3, 1989, we delivered a supplemental/deficiency questionnaireto the Government of Canada and the Provincial Governments of Alberta,Ontario, Manitoba, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. On April 17, 1989, we receivedresponses to the questionnaires from the Government of Canada and the fiveProvincial Governments. On April 21, 1989, we delivered a second supplemental/deficiencyquestionnaire to the Government of Canada and the Provincial Governmentof Alberta. On April 27, 1989, we received responses to this second supplemental/deficiency questionnaire from the Government of Canada and the ProvincialGovernment of Alberta. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation </ITAG>The United. States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule</T3> (HTS), and all merchandise enteredor withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after that date is nowclassified solely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s). TheDepartment is providing both the appropriate <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>(TSUSA) item number(s)and the appropriate HTS item number(s) with its product descriptions forconvenience and Customs purposes. The Department's written descriptionof the products under investigation remains dispositive as to the scopeof the products covered by this investigation. The products covered by this investigation are fresh, chilled, and frozenpork, currently provided for under TSUSA item numbers 106.4020 and 1.06.4040,and currently classifiable under HTS item numbers 0203.11.00, 0203.12.90,0203.19.40, 0203.21.00, 0203.22.90, and 0203.29.40. Specifically excludedfrom this investigation are any processed or otherwise prepared or preservedpork products such as canned hams, cured bacon, sausage and ground pork.<ITAG tagnum="84">Application of Section 771B </ITAG>Section 1313 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 amendedthe Tariff Act of 1930 to include a new section 771B. This section readsas follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">In the case of an agricultural product processed from a raw agriculturalproduct in which_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) the demand for the prior stage product is substantially dependenton the demand for the latter stage product, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) the processing operation adds only limited value to the raw commodity,subsidies found to be provided to either producers or processors of theproduct shall be deemed to be provided with respect to the manufacture,production, or exportation of the processed product. </ITAG>The subject merchandise in this investigation is fresh, chilled, and frozenpork, an agricultural product, processed from a raw agricultural product,live swine. Therefore, in this investigation we must first determine whetherthe elements of 771B are met. For the reasons described below, we preliminarilydetermine that the elements of 771B are met. Thus, subsidies found to beprovided to either producers or processors of live swine are deemed tobe provided with respect to the production or exportation of fresh, chilled,and frozen pork. Prior to the enactment of 771B, the Department considered benefits to producersof a raw agricultural product when calculating the benefits to producersof a processed agricultural product. See, <T3>Certain Fish from Canada: Final Countervailing Duty Determination </T3>(43FR 25996, June 16, 1978), <T3>Lamb Meat from New Zealand: Preliminary Affirmative CountervailingDuty Determination </T3>(46 FR 58128, November 30, 1981), <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Live Swine andFresh, Chilled, and Frozen Pork Products from Canada (Swine) </T3>(50 FR25098, June 15, 1985), <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Order: LambMeat from New Zealand </T3>(50 FR 37708, September 17, 1985), <T3>Preliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Red Raspberriesfrom Canada </T3>(50 FR 42574, October 21, 1985), <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Order: Ricefrom Thailand </T3>(51 FR 12356, April 10, 1986), and <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain FreshAtlantic Groundfish from Canada (Groundfish) </T3>(51 FR 10041, March 24,1986). In <T3>Swine</T3>, we considered benefits to hog growers as direct benefitsto pork producers in measuring the subsidy on fresh, frozen, and chilledpork. Respondents in that case argued that the Department should applythe upstream subsidy provision, section 771A of the Act, to determine ifbenefits to hog growers passed through to pork producers. We disagreed because we did not consider live swine to be an ``input'' into unprocessedpork. Therefore, since we otherwise did not have reasonable grounds tobelieve or suspect that an upstream subsidy was being paid or bestowedwith respect to unprocessed pork, we did not conduct an upstream subsidyinvestigation. Our reasons for determining that hogs were not an inputfor purposes of section 771A were clearly spelled out in <T3>Swine: </T3>``We believe there are two characteristics which evidencethat live swine should not be considered an `input' into fresh, frozen,and chilled pork products. These characteristics are level of value addedand the role of the producer.'' First, with respect to value added we stated,``A low level of value added at a given level of processing is an indicationthat the prior stage product entering that level is not an input into theprocessed product.'' Second, in our discussion of the role of the processorwe said, ``The salient criterion is the degree to which the demand forthe prior stage product is dependent on the demand for the latter stageproduct.'' Respondents in <T3>Swine</T3> appealed the <T3>Department's</T3> decision not to apply the upstream subsidies provision.The Court of International Trade (CIT) remanded <T3>Swine</T3> to the Department to conduct an upstream subsidy investigation.The CIT ruled that Commerce had to apply the upstream subsidy provisionbecause it found no exception to that provision for agricultural productseither in the statute or in the legislative history. <T3>See, Canadian Meat Council </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>661 F. Supp. 622 (1987). The decision of the CITcan only be considered advisory, however, because its later decision touphold the  ITC's negative injury determination regarding the domesticindustry for pork products mooted its remand instructions. <T3>See, National Pork Producers Council </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>661 F. Supp. 633 (1987). In light of the Court'sdecision, Congress amended the Act by adding section 771B to codify theDepartment's practice. 133 Cong. Rec. S8814-16 (daily ed. June 16, 1989).We preliminarily determine that the two criteria set out in 771B have beenmet in this case. The first element, regarding the demand relationshipbetween the raw and the processed product, is shown by the demand relationshipbetween live swine and fresh, chilled, and frozen pork. As we stated in<T3>Swine</T3>, the demand for the slaughtered and quartered swine is byfar the predominant determinant of the demand for live swine. Likewise,just as we found in <T3>Swine</T3>, we preliminarily find that substantially all of the rawagricultural product, live swine, is dedicated to the production of unprocessedpork. The fact that many separate processed products can be made beyondthis stage, <T3>e.g., </T3>canned ham and sausage, is irrelevant. The key is that thereis a single, continuous line of production from live swine to unprocessedpork.Furthermore, we preliminarily determine that the second criterion of 771B,limited value added, has also been satisfied in this case. According tothe questionnaire responses, the value added to hogs by pork processorsis approximately 20 percent. Although we have accepted this figure forpurposes of our preliminary determination, we note that based on our investigationthus far, there is no regularly maintained statistical information or acceptedmethodology for calculating  the value added by pork processors. Moreover,it appears that the value added by pork processors can vary markedly betweenproducers and over time. We will continue to examine other methodologiesfor calculating the value added and will accept comments on the most appropriateapproach for the final determination. Using the value added figure of 20 percent, however, we must determinewhether this figure represents ``limited value'' as the term is used insection 771B. Although the term ``limited value'' is not defined in thestatute and Congress provided little guidance with respect to how we shouldinterpret the term, we note that 771B was enacted by Congress to codifyour practice as set forth in the Department's decision in Swine. In <T3>Swine, </T3>we stated, ``[i]n value-added terms, the packing stageconsisting of immobilizing, stunning, dehairing, eviscerating, splitting,etc., does not contribute significantly to the value of the live swine.''Similarly, in <T3>Groundfish</T3>, Commerce considered the benefits to harvesters asbenefits to processors, even though the value added to the raw productby processing was, according to the respondents in that case, 40 to 45percent. In other agricultural cases, the value added to the raw producthas been even higher. Thus, based on the legislative history of 771B, ourpast practice and our investigation to date, we find it reasonable to determinepreliminarily that the process of converting a live hog into pork productsadds only limited value added for purposes of 771B. Therefore, for the reasons set forth above, we preliminarily determinethat subsidies found to be provided to live swine shall be deemed to beprovided with respect to the production or exportation of fresh, chilled,and frozen pork in accordance with section 771B of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs </ITAG>We used our standard methodology to calculate benefits under grant programs.Grants provided on a recurring basis are expensed in the year of receipt.For non-recurring grants, we totalled the grants provided within each programand divided by the total sales value of the subject merchandise from thefive provinces. If the sum was less than 0.5 percent of all sales concerned,we expensed such grants in the year of receipt. Since we have not yet receivedsales information for the years prior to the review period, we used asbest information available the sales value for 1988 as reported in theresponse to determine if grants received prior to 1988 should be allocatedover time or expensed in the year of receipt. For all grant programs reviewedin this investigation, based on this methodology, grants were expensedin the year of receipt. Consistent with our practice in preliminary determinations, when a responseto an allegation denies the existence of a program, receipt of benefitsunder a program, or eligibility of a company or producer under a program,and the Department has no persuasive evidence showing that the responseis incorrect, we accept the response for purposes of the preliminary determination.All such responses, however, are subject to verification under section776(b) of the Act. If the response cannot be supported at verificationand the program is otherwise countervailable, the program will be considereda subsidy in our final determination.  For purposes of this preliminary determination, the period for which weare measuring subsidies (``the review period'') is calendar year 1988. Based on our analysis of the petition and the responses to our questionnaires,we preliminarily determine the following: <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Programs Preliminarily Determined To Confer Subsidies  </ITAG>We preliminarily determine that subsidies are being provided to producersor exporters in Canada of fresh, chilled, and frozen pork under the followingprograms: A. Federal Programs  1. Agricultural Stabilization Act/National Tripartite Red Meat StabilizationProgram The Agricultural Stabilization Act (ASA) of 1958 was passed bythe Federal Government to provide for the price stabilization of certainagricultural commodities. On June 27, 1985, the ASA was amended by BillC-25, which authorized the Minister of Agriculture, with the approval ofthe Governor in Council, to enter into agreements with the provinces and/orproducers to provide price stabilization schemes for any natural or processedproduct of agriculture. The Minister may enter into these tripartite agreementsonly after he determines that they will not give a financial advantageto some producers in the production or marketing of the product not enjoyedby other producers of the same product in Canada and that the agreementswill not provide an incentive to overproduce.  Four groups of commodities are explicitly provided for, or ``named,'' inthe ASA: (1) cattle, hogs, lambs and wool; (2) industrial milk and industrialcream; (3) corn and soybeans; and (4) spring wheat, winter wheat, oatsand barley. Other natural or processed products of agriculture may be ``designated''by the Governor in Council as agricultural commodities for purposes ofreceiving stabilization payments under the ASA.  Tripartite agreements on hogs were signed effective January l, 1986, withAlberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario. An amended agreement wassigned on February 8, 1989, adding the Provinces of British Columbia, Quebec,New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia. Under the terms ofthe Tripartite Agreements on Hogs, the provinces may not offer separatestabilization plans or other <T3>ad hoc</T3> assistance for hogs, nor may the Federal Government offercompensation to hog producers in a province not a party to the agreement.The Tripartite scheme provides for a five-year phase-in period to adjustfor differences between the Tripartite scheme and the provincial programs.Existing provincial stabilization plans are to be completely phased outby 1991.  The Tripartite Agreements on Hogs are administered by the StabilizationCommittee (``Committee'') in conjunction with the Agricultural StabilizationBoard (``Board''). The Committee consists of nine voting members, threeof which are appointed by the provincial governments, three by the FederalGovernment, and three by the federal Minister of Agriculture from a listof pork producers. The members of the Board are appointed by the Governorin Council. The Committee calculates the stabilization payments for bothnamed and designated products on a quarterly basis in the following manner.First, it calculates a ``support price,'' which is equal to the cash costsof production in the current 13-week period plus 93 percent of the averagemargin in the same l3-week period for the preceding five years. The marginfor any period is equal to the national average market price for the periodminus the national average cash costs in that period. The difference betweenthe support price and the average market price is the amount of the stabilizationpayment. Stabilization payments are triggered in any 13-week period thatthe market price falls below the support price. Payments are made onlyon hogs indexing 80 or above.As previously stated, certain selected commodities are specifically namedin the ASA and, as such, are guaranteed stabilization schemes under theASA. Funding for named commodities is approved as a ``statutory item''in the budget through existing legislation, <T3>i.e.</T3>, the legal authority exists for the Committee to supportnamed commodities without the need for additional parliamentary approval.In contrast, funding for designated commodities is a ``vote item'' in the. budget and, as such, must be approved by Parliament as a specific appropriationfor a specific purpose. Each year, prescribed prices are automaticallycalculated for named commodities, whereas designated products are onlyconsidered for ASA payments if the Governor in Council so directs. Therefore,for designated products, there is no automatic calculation of a prescribedprice and no guarantee of ASA payments. The distinction between named anddesignated items indicates that certain products are specifically targetedfor ASA benefits.  Although any other natural or processed products of agriculture aside fromthe named commodities may be designated by the Governor in Council to receivepayments under the ASA, we must look beyond the <T3>de jure</T3> eligibility requirements for a given program to the <T3>de facto</T3> evidence as to which enterprises or industries were actuallyincluded in ASA stabilization schemes. In our final administrative reviewof <T3>Live Swine,</T3> we found that several major agricultural commodities,such as most wheat, dairy products, and poultry, are not included in ASAstabilization schemes. The record in this case is unclear whether the factorsthat led to a finding of specificity in <T3>Live Swine</T3> have changed. Based on the <T3>de facto</T3> finding in <T3>Live Swine</T3> and the distinction between named and designated productsdiscussed above, we preliminarily determine that payments under the ASAare limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprisesor industries and are, therefore, countervailable. We will examine thisissue further before the final determination.  To calculate the benefit under this program, we first calculated the dressed-weightequivalent of all hogs marketed in the five provinces during the reviewperiod. To obtain the dressed-weight equivalent, we used the conversionfactor of 79.5 percent as provided in the Government of Canada response.Since the stabilization payments are paid out from a pool of funds whichare made up of equal contributions from the federal government, provincialgovernments, and producer premiums, plus interest, we multiplied the stabilizationpayments made during the review period by two-thirds to factor out theproducer premiums and allocated the result over the dressed-weight equivalentof hogs marketed in the five provinces during the review period to obtainan estimated net subsidy of Can$0.026945/kg. (Can$0.012222/lb.).  Petitioner has argued that we should change our calculation methodologyto reflect benefits accrued on sales made during the review period as opposedto cash payments received during the review period. If we find this programto be countervailable in our final determination, we will consider petitioner'scomments, as well as comments from other interested parties, as to whichis the most appropriate method to calculate the benefit.  <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Feed Freight Assistance Program (FFAP)  </ITAG>In 1966, Parliament enacted the Livestock Feed Assistance Act in responseto domestic feed grain supply problems and price fluctuations in EasternCanada and British Columbia. The Canada Livestock Feed Board oversees theFFAP. The Board ensures the availability of feed grain to meet the needsof livestock feeders, the availability of adequate storage space in EasternCanada for feed grain, and price stability for feed grain in Eastern Canada,British Columbia, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories. Only users of grain,<T3>i.e.</T3>, those who buy grain to feed livestock (commercial millsand livestock producers), are eligible for assistance.  To qualify for assistance, the feed grain must be transported outside thefarm where it is grown and moved through commercial channels. Commercialchannels are defined as transactions that provide an invoice, weight certificate,grade certificate, and bill of lading. Payments are made only on grainthat will be fed to livestock.  Benefits are provided for transporting and storing feed. Payments for feedgrain transportation are set per ton according to the grain's destination.Feed grain storage payments are paid on a product basis.  Because this program is limited to feed grain users in Eastern Canada andBritish Columbia, we preliminarily determine that it is limited to a specificenterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries and is, therefore,countervailable.  According to the responses, the most recent data on this program is forthe 1986-1987 crop year. Of the five provinces we are examining for purposesof this investigation, only Ontario and Quebec are eligible for assistanceunder the program. In its response, the Government of Canada estimatedthat less than five percent of the program benefits were provided to individualsinvolved in hog production. To calculate a benefit for the program, wetherefore used as best information available five percent of the disbursementsmade to Ontario and Quebec in 1986-1987, as reported in the latest availableannual report of the Livestock Feed Board submitted in the response. Wedivided this amount by the dressed-weight equivalent of hogs marketed duringthe review period in the five provinces to obtain an estimated net subsidyof Can$0.000115/kg. (Can$0.000052/lb.). B. PROVINCIAL PROGRAMS  1. Alberta Crow Benefit Offset Program. The purpose of this program, whichis administered by Agriculture Alberta, is to eliminate market distortionsin feed grain prices created by the federal government's policy on graintransportation.  Assistance is provided on feed grain produced in Alberta, feed grain producedoutside Alberta but sold in Alberta, and feed grain produced in Albertato be fed to livestock on the same farm. The government provides certificatesto registered feed grain users and registered feed grain merchants whichcan be used as partial payments for grains purchased from grain producers.Feed grain producers who feed their own grain to their own livestock submita claim directly to the government for payment.Because this program is limited to feed grain users, we preliminarily determinethat it is limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprisesor industries and is, therefore, countervailable.  Hog producers receive benefits in one of three ways. Hog producers whodo not grow any of their own feed grain receive certificates which areused to cover part of the cost of purchasing grain. Hog producers who growall of their own grain submit a claim to the Government of Alberta fordirect payment. Finally, hog producers who grow part of their own grainbut who also purchase grain receive both certificates and direct payments. The Government of Alberta estimated that 12 percent of benefits providedunder this program went to swine producers. Therefore, to calculate thebenefit, we took 12 percent of the total amount of benefits to feed grainusers in Alberta and allocated it over the dressed-weight equivalent ofhogs marketed during the review period in the five provinces. On this basis,we calculated an estimated net subsidy of Can$0.002948/kg. (Can$0.001337/lb.).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Ontario Farm Tax Rebate Program  </ITAG>The Ontario Farm Tax Rebate Program replaced the Ontario Farm Tax ReductionProgram. While the Ontario Farm Tax Reduction Program provided a rebateof 60 percent of total property taxes levied on eligible farm properties,the current program provides a rebate of 100 percent of taxes levied onoutbuildings and properties only. Taxes levied on the residence and oneacre of land are no longer rebated.  Any resident of Ontario may receive a rebate if he owns and pays taxeson eligible properties. Eligible properties are farming enterprises thatproduce farm products with a gross value of Can$8,000 in southern and westernOntario and Can$5,000 in northern and eastern Ontario. Since all farmersin Ontario whose gross output is at least Can$8,000 are eligible to receivea rebate under this program, the program is limited to a specific enterpriseor industry, or group of enterprises or industries, and is thus countervailable,only to the extent that farmers in northern and eastern Ontario whose grossoutput is between Can$5,000 8,000 receive benefits.  Based on data taken from the <T3>1986 Census of Agriculture, Statistics Canada, </T3>the last year forwhich complete information is available, the Government of Ontario estimatedthat 4.7 percent of all Ontario swine farmers have sales valued withinthe Can$5,000-8,000 range. To calculate the benefit, we multiplied thetotal amount paid to swine producers in eastern and northern Ontario by4.7 percent during the review period. We divided the result by the dressed-weightequivalent of hogs marketed during the review period in the five provincesto obtain an estimated net subsidy of Can$0.000020/kg. (Can$0.000009/lb.).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Ontario (Northern) Livestock Improvement Program  </ITAG>The purpose of this program is to aid livestock producers in northern Ontarioby increasing production through herd improvement. Livestock producersin northern Ontario are reimbursed up to 20 percent of the cost of purchasingbreeding stock from Ontario, Quebec or Western Canada which meet certainperformance requirements. A maximum of Can$2,500 may be reimbursed to anindividual during a three-year period.  Because this program is limited to livestock producers in northern Ontario,we preliminarily determine it to be limited to a specific enterprise orindustry, or group of enterprises or industries and, therefore, countervailable. To calculate the benefit to swine growers, we allocated the reimbursementsmade to swine growers during the review period, as reported in the response,over the dressed-weight equivalent of hogs marketed during the review periodin the five provinces to obtain an estimated net subsidy of less than Can$0.000001in either kilograms or pounds. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Ontario (Northern) Livestock Transportation Assistance Program </ITAG>This program is designed to assist livestock growers in northern Ontarioby reducing their relatively higher costs of maintaining and improvingherd quality. Livestock growers who purchase breeding stock from Ontario,Quebec or Western Canada which meet certain performance requirements receivea grant equal to 50 percent of the delivery charges for such livestock. Because this program is limited to livestock growers in northern Ontario,we preliminarily determine that it is limited to a specific enterpriseor industry, or group of enterprises or industries and is, therefore, countervailable. To calculate the benefit, we divided the grants received by swine growersduring the review period by the dressed-weight equivalent of hogs marketedduring the review period in the five provinces to obtain an estimated netsubsidy of less than Can$0.000001 in either kilograms or pounds. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Ontario Pork Industry Improvement Plan (OPIIP)  </ITAG>The purpose of the OPIIP is to foster excellence in farm business managementand the adoption of improved production technologies. Assistance is providedunder a number of subprograms. To be eligible for any of the subprograms,a producer must have at least 20 sow equivalents (one sow equivalent isequal to one sow or 15 market-weight hogs marketed annually) and must submitthe required production records. Assistance is provided under the followingsubprograms:  <T3>a. Swine Production Analysis Grants: </T3>Hog growers receive a grantof Can$5 per sow equivalent after they submit production records for thecalendar year. The maximum grant for finishing operations is Can$200. Forfarrow-to-finish operations, the minimum is Can$200 and the maximum isCan$500.  <T3>b. Enterprise Analysis Grants: </T3>A grant of Can$100 is providedto growers who supply financial records annually in the approved format.Growers also receive a confidential business analysis based on their financialrecords which identifies the strengths and weaknesses of their farm operations. <T3>c. Swine Ventilation Grants: </T3>Growers receive a grant of two-thirdsof the cost of materials to correct ventilation problems. These grantsare given up to a maximum of Can$1,500. Eligible items include fans, thermostats,heat exchangers, insulation materials, air vents, materials for naturalventilation, recirculation systems, heaters, monitoring equipment, electricalwiring and cooling equipment.  <T3>d. Productivity and Quality Improvement Grants: </T3>Growers receivea grant of two-thirds of the cost of materials for eligible projects whichinclude scales for weighing pigs or feed, swine loading facilities, highpressure washers, electronic pregnancy detection equipment, rodent controlbarriers, caesarean section or embryo transfer facilities and slatted floorsin farrowing pens.  <T3>e. Artificial Insemination Grants: </T3>Growers receive grants to covertwo-thirds of the cost of purchasing and transporting swine semen or ofthe tuition for approved artificial insemination courses. Grants cannotexceed Can$500.  <T3>f. Rodent Control Grants: </T3>A grant of Can$250 is paid to growerswho complete a 12-month rodent control program by a professional licensedexterminator.  <T3>g. Private Veterinary Herd Health Program: </T3>Growers who institutea herd health program supervised by a private veterinarian with at leastfour consultative visits per year receive a grant of Can$200 per year. <T3>h. Education Grants: </T3>Growers receive up to Can$100 to cover 50percent of the tuition fees for approved courses.<T3>i. Feed Analysis Grants: </T3>Feed analysis vouchers are provided togrowers annually.  <T3>j. Herd Health Improvement Grants: </T3>Grants are given (1) to establisha primary herd or maintain a closed herd and (2) to depopulate and restockherds with pigs of improved health status. The amount of the grant dependson the performance level of the animals. For animals classified ``excellent''the maximum grant is Can$10,000 and for animals classified ``good'' themaximum grant is Can$5,000.  <T3>k. Ontario Swine Artificial Insemination Association Grants: </T3>Grantsare paid to a farmer cooperative for the purpose of developing swine semenproduction facilities.  <T3>1. Ontario Pork Producers Marketing Board Grants: </T3>Education grantsare provided to numerous county chapters of the Ontario Pork ProducersMarketing Board.  In addition to the subprograms above, grants are also provided to supportvarious research projects related to swine production. For additional informationon these grants, see Section II of the notice, <T3>Program Preliminarily Determined to be Not Countervailable.</T3>  Because the OPIIP provides grants to swine growers only, we preliminarilydetermine that it is limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or groupof enterprises or industries and is, therefore, countervailable.  To calculate the benefit, we summed the grants provided under this programduring the review period and divided the result by the dressed-weight equivalentof hogs marketed in the five provinces during the review period to calculatean estimated net subsidy of Can$0.002332/kg. (Can$0.001058/lb.). <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Ontario Marketing Assistance Program for Pork (MAPP)  </ITAG>This program, instituted in 1986, assists Ontario pork processors in theirefforts to improve domestic market prospects for pork sales and to sustainand enhance their ability to compete in global pork markets. Pork packersand processors receive grants of 25 percent of the total cost of plantupgrading, new technology adoption or new product development. The maximumgrant per project is Can$2,000,000. No single firm can receive more thanCan$3,000,000 over the five years of the program. Grants under this programwere first disbursed in 1987.  Because this program provides grants to pork processors only, we preliminarilydetermine that it is limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or groupof enterprises or industries and is, therefore, countervailable.  To calculate the benefit, we summed the grants provided under this programduring the review period and divided the result by the dressed-weight equivalentof hogs marketed in the five provinces during the review period to calculatean estimated net subsidy of Can$0.000491/kg. (Can$0.000223/lb.). <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Quebec Farm Income Stabilization Insurance Program (QFISIP)  </ITAG>This program was started in 1976 to guarantee a net annual income to participatinggrowers. The program is administered by the Regie des Assurance Agricolesdu Quebec (Regie), which each year stabilizes the income of growers whooperate in accordance with its production and marketing standards. Theprogram covers cow-calf cattle, feeder cattle, potatoes, weaner pigs, feederhogs, corn, oats, wheat, barley, heavy veal, and sheep. To be eligiblefor the piglet or feeder hog programs, a grower must own the feeder hogsor sows he insures, be personally involved in raising the feeder hogs orpiglets, own at least 300 insurable hogs or 15 insurable sows and enrollin the scheme for at least five years. The coverage year for the feederhog program is from April l to March 31 and from July l to June 30 forthe piglet program.  The support level is calculated according to a cost of production modelthat includes an adjustment for the difference between the average wageof farm workers and the average wage of all other workers in Quebec. Paymentsto growers are calculated on a yearly basis and are made at the end ofthe covered year. The program is funded two-thirds by the provincial governmentand one third by producer assessments. For the 1988-1989 insurance year,pursuant to the amendment of July 13, 1988, regarding the QFISIP, producerassessments and the stabilized net annual income have been set accordingto the size of production.  Since several major agricultural commodities, such as eggs, dairy products,and poultry are not included, we preliminarily determine this program tobe limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprisesor industries and, therefore, countervailable.  We calculated the benefit by multiplying the total amount of stabilizationpayments made during the review period by two-thirds to factor out theproducer assessments. We then divided the result by the dressed-weightequivalent of hogs marketed during the review period in the five provincesto obtain an estimated net subsidy of Can$0.042318/kg. (Can$0.019195/lb.).<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Quebec Productivity Improvement and Consolidation of LivestockProduction Programs (QPICLP)  </ITAG>The QPICLP was started in 1987 and was designed for small livestock farmers,excluding large swine growers and packers. The program is divided intoeight subprograms. Swine growers are only eligible for one subprogram,the Farm Building Improvements Program. Under this subprogram, grants areprovided to convert existing piggeries to farrow-to-finish operations.Grants cover up to 30 percent of the actual cost of the conversion.  To be eligible for assistance, applicants must be recognized farm producersaccording to the Farm Producer's Act and be registered with the Bureaude Renseignements Agricoles. Producers operating farrowing piggeries mustmaintain between 40 and 80 sows, and finishing piggeries must maintainbetween 500 and 1,000 hogs. Maximum assistance is Can$200 per sow and Can$25per hog, with a maximum of Can$15,000 per farm operation for the durationof the program.  Because this program is limited to livestock producers, we preliminarilydetermine it to be limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or groupof enterprises or industries and, therefore, countervailable.To calculate the benefit, we summed the grants provided under this programduring the review period and divided the result by the dressed-weight equivalentof hogs marketed in the five provinces during the review period to calculatean estimated net subsidy of Can$0.000010/kg. (Can$0.000005/lb.).<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Quebec Regional Development Assistance (QRDA)</ITAG>The QRDA was started in 1987 to promote regional development in Quebec.The program consists of four subprograms: Soil Upgrading, Consolidationof Cattle and Sheep Production, Assistance for Transporting Livestock,and Marketing Assistance. Swine growers are only eligible for the Assistancefor Transporting Livestock subprogram. This subprogram provides eligiblefarmers financial assistance for transporting animals to a slaughterhouseor to a public market. To be eligible for assistance under this program,swine growers must be located in one of the following agricultural regions:Bas St-Laurent et Gaspesie, Quebec, Outaouais, or Saguenay. The assistanceoffered varies according to the zone in which the applicant's operationis located.Because this program is limited to farmers in specific regions of Quebec,we preliminarily determine that it is limited to a specific enterpriseor industry, or group of enterprises or industries and is, therefore, countervailable.To calculate the benefit, we divided the amount of payments made to hogproducers during the review period by the dressed-weight equivalent ofhogs marketed during the review period in the five provinces to obtainan estimated net subsidy of Can$0.000025/kg. (Can$0.000011/lb.).<ITAG tagnum="81">10. Saskatchewan Hog Assured Returns Program (SHARP)</ITAG>SHARP was established in 1976 pursuant to the Saskatchewan AgriculturalReturns Stabilization Act. SHARP provides stabilization payments to theSaskatchewan hog producers when market returns fall below a designated``floor price.'' The program is administered by the Saskatchewan Pork Producers,Marketing Board on behalf of the provincial Department of Agriculture.Under the Saskatchewan Agricultural Returns Act, the provincial governmentmay establish a stabilization plan for any agricultural commodity. However,in practice, only hogs and beef have such plans.To be eligible, a grower must own market hogs which are raised and finishedto slaughter weight on the production unit, or which are purchased as weanlingor feeder hogs and fed a minimum of 60 days. Coverage is limited to 1,500hogs per grower per quarter.The program is funded through producer premiums and matching funds fromthe provincial government. When Saskatchewan joined the National TripartiteRed Meat Stabilization Program on January 1, 1986, SHARP payments werereduced by the amount of payments received through the Tripartite program.No producers have been eligible to join SHARP since December 31, 1985.SHARP payments are being phased out and will be terminated by March 31,1991.Under SHARP, the levy (producer premium) for producers is three percentof market returns on the sale of covered hogs. However, if the intereston the SHARP account for that quarter and the three previous quarters isnegative, the levy can range from 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent. If the interestin the account is positive and greater than 3.0 percent, the levy can rangefrom l.5 percent to 2.5 percent. If the balance in the SHARP account isinsufficient to make stabilization payments, the provincial governmentloans the necessary funds to SHARP.Stabilization payments are based on the sum of the producer's cash costsplus 75 percent of the sum of non-cash costs for each quarter. Paymentsare made at the end of each quarter.Because this program is limited to swine producers, we preliminarily determineit to be limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprisesor industries and, therefore, countervailable.To calculate the benefit, we multiplied the total amount of stabilizationpayments made in 1988 by one-half to factor out producer premiums and dividedthe result by the dressed-weight equivalent of hogs marketed during thereview period in the five provinces to obtain an estimated net subsidyof Can$0.001380/kg. (Can$0.000626/lb.). <ITAG tagnum="81">11. Saskatchewan Livestock Investment Tax Credit  Program (SLITC)</ITAG>The SLITC provides investment tax credits to livestock growers who payincome taxes and whose livestock are fed in Saskatchewan for slaughter.Hogs, cattle and sheep are covered by this program. To be eligible, hogsmust index 80 or higher, must be owned for at least 60 days, and must befed in Saskatchewan. Hog growers are eligible for a tax credit of Can$3.00per hog. There is a Can$100 deduction from the credit in each year thetax credit is claimed. If any portion of the tax credit is not used, itmay be carried forward for up to seven years.Because the SLITC is limited to certain livestock growers, we preliminarilydetermine that it is limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or groupof enterprises or industries and is, therefore, countervailable.To calculate the benefit, we multiplied the estimated number of swine producerswho used this program by $100. We then subtracted this amount from theestimated amount of credits claimed by swine producers during the reviewperiod. We divided the result by the dressed-weight equivalent of hogsmarketed during the review period in the five provinces to obtain an estimatednet subsidy of Can$0.000553/kg. (Can$0.000251/lb.).<ITAG tagnum="81">12. Saskatchewan Livestock Facilities Tax Credit Program (SLFTCP).</ITAG>The SLFTCP, implemented on January 1, 1986, provides tax credits to livestockgrowers for investment in livestock production facilities. The creditsare deductible only from provincial taxes.Livestock eligible under this program includes cattle, horses, sheep, swine,goats, poultry, bees, or fur-bearing animals raised in captivity. Investmentscovered under this program include new buildings, improvements to existinglivestock facilities and any stationary equipment related to livestockfacilities.During the review period, livestock growers were eligible for a tax creditof 15 percent of 95 percent (14.25 percent) of the total facilities investment.Participants may carry forward any unused credit for up to seven years.Because this program is limited to certain livestock growers, we preliminarilydetermine it to be limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or groupof enterprises or industries and, therefore, countervailable.To calculate the benefit, as best information available, we divided thetotal tax credits claimed in 1987, as estimated in the response, by thedressed-weight equivalent of hogs marketed during the review period inthe five provinces to obtain an estimated net subsidy of Can$0.000162/kg.(Can$0.000074/lb.).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Program Preliminarily Determined To Be Not Countervailable</ITAG>Research Grants Under the OPIIPResearch grants under OPIIP are provided to support research projects relatedto swine production. According to the response, the results of such researchare publicly available both inside and outside Canada. Therefore we preliminarilydetermine that the benefits of such research grants are not limited toa specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries,and that the grants are therefore not countervailable.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Programs Preliminarily Determined Not To Be Used</ITAG>We preliminarily determine that the following programs were not used byproducers or exporters in Canada of fresh, chilled, and frozen pork duringthe review period:1. Canada/Alberta Subsidiary Agreement on Agricultural Processing and MarketingThis subsidiary agreement operates under the Economic and Regional DevelopmentAgreement (ERDA) between the Government of Alberta and the Government ofCanada which became effective June 8, 1984. The agreement is jointly fundedand administered by the federal and the provincial government. The purposeof the agreement is to enhance the agricultural processing sector of Alberta'seconomy.Applicants who carry out approved projects within the agricultural processingsector receive non-repayable contributions toward eligible costs incurred.Applications are reviewed by the Management Committee to the Agreementto determine whether the project is eligible and whether it meets the program'sobjectives. Eligible projects include the establishment, expansion, andmodernization of processing operations and testing and research facilities,as well as feasibility studies and product research and development.Assistance cannot exceed 35 percent of costs for a new facility (25 percentfor projects in Calgary or Edmonton) and 25 percent of costs for the modernizationof an existing facility (l5 percent for projects in Edmonton or Calgary).Funds are not available until the project is commercially operational atwhich time 90 percent of the non-repayable contribution is issued. Theremaining 10 percent is issued only after 24 months of continuous operation.According to the responses, no assistance was provided to federally-inspectedpork producers (the only producers eligible to export) during the reviewperiod.2. Manitoba Hog Income Stabilization Program.This program was created to provide income support payments to hog producerswhen the market price for hogs fell below an established price supportlevel. It was funded by premiums from participating producers and fromthe provinicial government. This program was terminated effective June28, 1986.3. Ontario Export Sales AidThis program assists agriculture and food producers and processors withtheir efforts to develop markets abroad by providing financial and technicalsupport for various promotional activities. According to the response ofthe Government of Ontario, no assistance was provided to hog growers orpork producers during the review period.4. Ontario Small Food Processors Assistance ProgramThis program assists eligible small food processing companies by improvingtheir access to market information, strengthening their business planningskills and capabilities and providing financial assistance on eligiblecapital investments. According to the response of the Government of Ontario,no assistance was provided to hog growers or pork producers during thereview period.5. Quebec Meat Sector Rationalization Program (QMSRP)The QMSRP was started in 1975 and terminated in 1982, with financial assistancegranted until 1984. The program was designed to foster the developmentof the Quebec meat sector, to provide Quebec producers viable outlets fortheir production and to improve the industry's competitive position. Underthe QMSRP, the Ministry of Agriculture assumes part of the eligible capitalcosts of investments for the establishment, standardization, expansion,modernization or amalgamation of slaughterhouses or meat processing plants.Under the QMSRP, producers were eligible for the equivalent of 35 percentof the cost of eligible capital assets, up to a maximum of Can$200,000per business.According to the response, no grants were provided under this program duringthe review period, therefore, we preliminarily determine this program tobe not used. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Programs for Which More Information is Needed </ITAG>l. Alberta Department of Economic Development and Trade Act  Loans, loan guarantees and grants were made to pork packers in Albertaunder the Alberta Department of Economic Development and Trade Act. Weare seeking additional information to determine whether eligibility forassistance under this program is limited by law or in practice to a specificenterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries. 2. Special Canada Grains Program  The Special Canada Grains Program 1987 Extension (SCGP 1987) provides grantsto grain, oilseed, special crop and honey producers, who have experienceddramatic drops in income due to international agricultural policies. Tobe eligible for assistance, producers must have seeded acreage in Canadaof eligible crops harvested in 1987 or have seeded acreage which was cutfor silage, greenfeed, ploughed down, or left for summerfallow, due toa natural disaster. Eligible crops include wheat, oats, barley, mixed grains,rye, corn, and high moisture grains which are intended to be harvestedas grains or fed to livestock.  Payments are based on producers' seeded acreage of eligible crops harvestedor intended for harvest in 1987, weighted by representative yields andan assistance rate. Representative yields were averaged from the best threeyears between 1981 and 1986 to minimize the influence of abnormal croploss situations. Assistance rates for grains, oilseeds and special cropsare calculated based on the decrease in 1987 market prices compared with1985 prices for the eligible crops. Payments are made yearly, with a Can$25,000maximum per producer per year.  We are seeking more information to determine whether this program conferscountervailable benefits on the production of hogs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Verification  </ITAG>In accordance with section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the informationused in making our final determination. <ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation  </ITAG>In accordance with section 703(d) of the Act, we are directing the U.S.Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of fresh, chilled,and frozen pork products from Canada which are entered, or withdrawn fromwarehouse, for consumption, on or after the date of publication of thisnotice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and to require a cash deposit or bond for allentries of this merchandise equal to Can$0.077/kg.
