The notice was based onthe recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Miscellaneous ExternalDrug Products, which was the advisory review panel responsible for evaluatingdata on the active ingredients in this drug class. Interested persons wereinvited to submit comments by April 5, 1982. Reply comments in responseto comments filed in the initial comment period could be submitted by May5, 1982.In accordance with andSection; 330.10(a)(10), the data and information consideredby the Panel were put on public display in the Dockets Management Branch(address above). In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking,one drug manufacturers' association, one law firm, and two manufacturerssubmitted comments. Copies of the comments received are on public displayin the Dockets Management Branch.In this proposed rule to amend part 310 by adding to subpart E new andSection;310.530 (21 CFR 310.530), FDA states for the first time its position onOTC topically applied hormone-containing drug products. Final agency actionon this matter will occur with the publication at a future date of a finalrule for OTC topically applied hormone-containing drug products.This proposal constitutes FDA's tentative adoption of the Panel's conclusionsand recommendations on OTC topically applied hormone-containing drug productsas modified on the basis of the comments received and the agency's independentevaluation of the Panel's report. FDA will no longer use the terms ``CategoryI'' (generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded), ``CategoryII'' (not generally recognized as safe and effective or misbranded), and``Category III'' (available data are insufficient to classify as safe andeffective, and further testing is required) at the final rule stage, butwill use instead the terms ``monograph conditions'' (old Category I) and``nonmonograph conditions'' (old Categories II and III). This documentretains the concepts of Categories I, II, and III at the proposed rulestage.In the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, the agency stated that ifit proposed to adopt the Panel's recommendation it would propose that topicallyapplied hormone-containing drug products be eliminated from the OTC marketeffective 6 months after the date of publication of a final rule in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>, regardless of whether further testing was undertakento justify their future use. Based on all information available to date,the agency is proposing that OTC topically applied hormone-containing drugproducts be found not to be generally recognized as safe and effective.If the proposed finding is adopted in the final rule, the agency advisesthat the conditions under which the drug products that are subject to thisrule are not generally recognized as safe and effective and are misbranded(nonmonograph conditions) will be effective 6 months after the date ofpublication of the final rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. On or after that date, no OTC drug productsthat are subject to the rule may be initially introduced or initially deliveredfor introduction into interstate commerce unless they are the subject ofan approved application (NDA). Further, any OTC drug product subject tothe final rule that is repackaged or relabeled after the effective dateof the final rule must be in compliance with the final rule regardlessof the date the product was initially introduced or initially deliveredfor introduction into interstate commerce. Manufacturers are encouragedto comply voluntarily with the proposed rule at the earliest possible date.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. The Agency's Tentative Conclusions on the Comments</ITAG>A. General Comments on Topically Applied Hormone-Containing Drug Products1. One comment urged that andSection; 310.530 be amended to limit it to thekind and type of hormone ingredients and products considered by the Panelin this rulemaking proceeding, i.e., skin creams and skin oils containingestrogens and progesterone that are marketed for topical use with claimsfor the improvement to or enhancement of the condition of the skin. Notingthat estradiol was considered separately by the Panel under two dockets,hair grower and hair loss prevention drug products and hormone-containingdrug products, the comment maintained that ``the agency should separatethe subject matter in the proposed monographs and new regulations.''The term ``hormone'' broadly describes a chemical substance formed in someorgan of the body, such as the adrenal glands or the pituitary, and carriedto another organ or tissue, where it has a specific effect (ref. 1). Thereare many types of hormones (ref. 2). Standard reference texts, such as``Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary,'' ``AMA Drug Evaluations,''and ``The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics,'' use a number of similarterms to describe the various types of hormones. The terms ``estrogens''and ``progestins'' are generally used to describe the types of ingredientsreviewed by the Panel (refs. 3 and 4). Estrogens include steroidal estrogenssuch as estradiol, estrone, conjugated estrogens, esterified estrogens,and ethinyl estradiol, and nonsteroidal estrogens such as dienestrol anddiethylstilbestrol (ref. 5). Progestins include progesterone, esthisterone,and medroxyprogesterone acetate (refs. 6 and 7). Pregnenolone is a steriodclosely related to progesterone in chemical structure, but it exerts anestrogen-like action on the skin when applied topically (ref. 8).One of the call-for-data notices that listed ingredients in hormone creamsfor which data should be submitted to the Panel listed the ingredientsestradiol, estrogen, estrogenic hormones, estrone, natural estrogens, pregnenoloneacetate, and progesterone. (See the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of August 27, 1975; 40 FR 38179.) This list wasintended to be a representative, but not all-inclusive, list of the typesof hormones to be reviewed. Likewise, the list of hormones in this documentis intended to be representative, but not all-inclusive.Examples of other general types of hormones are adrenal corticosteroidsand synthetic analogs, androgens, and anabolic steroids (ref. 9). Hydrocortisoneis an adrenal corticosteroid. The synthetic analogs include dexamethasone,prednisone, prednisolone, and triamcinolone. Androgens include testosteroneand methyltestosterone. Anabolic steroids include ethylestrenol, methandrostenolone,and oxymetholone.The Panel discussed topically applied hormone-containing drug productsas a therapeutic class with emphasis on the two groups of active ingredients,the estrogens and progesterone, that are generally used in these products(47 FR 430 at 432). The Panel concluded that none of these ingredientsis generally recognized as safe and effective for OTC drug use. The Panelalso stated that it was not aware of any data demonstrating the safetyand effectiveness of any other ingredient used in topically applied hormone-containingdrug products for OTC use (47 FR 432). The agency is not aware of any estrogens,progestins, androgens, anabolic steroids, or adrenal corticosteroids thatare currently generally recognized or proposed for general recognitionas safe and effective for OTC topical drug use, except hydrocortisone preparationsfor topical use for the temporary relief of itching associated with minorskin irritations, inflammation, and rashes. (See the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 8, 1983; 48 FR 5852.)As the comment pointed out, estradiol was also reviewed by the Panel inits report on hair grower and hair loss prevention drug products for OTChuman use, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 7, 1980 (45 FR 73955). The Panelconcluded that there was a lack of evidence to establish effectivenessof estradiol and hormone constituents as hair growers or hair loss preventionOTC drug products and recommended that they be classified in Category II(45 FR 73959). The agency concurred with the Panel's recommendations inthe proposed rule for these products that was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of January 15, 1985 (50 FR 2190). More recently,in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of July 7, 1989 (54 FR 28772), the agency concludedthat estradiol is not generally recognized as safe and effective for claimsof hair growth and hair loss prevention.For the reasons stated above, the agency has determined that the titleof the regulation that is the subject of this document should remain ``topicallyapplied hormone-containing drug products for OTC human use,'' as statedin the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. However, FDA has revisedandSection; 310.530(a) to state the scope of the regulation. Also, the agencyis adding a new paragraph (e) in which it will list any hormone ingredientsthat are not covered by the regulation. This paragraph will include anyhormone that is currently generally recognized or proposed for generalrecognition as safe and effective for OTC topical drug use. At the presenttime, the only hormones that are included in paragraph (e) are hydrocortisoneand hydrocortisone acetate, which were proposed as Category I ingredientsfor the temporary relief of itching associated with minor skin irritations,inflammation, and rashes in the notice of proposed rulemaking for externalanalgesic drug products for OTC human use, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5852).<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) ``Webster's New World Dictionary,'' College Ed., Cleveland andNew York, 1968, s.v. ``hormone.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) ``Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary,'' 26th Ed., W.B.

Two comments stated that the Panel's proper function was to evaluatethe safety and effectiveness of hormone-containing products intended forOTC drug use, and not those intended for cosmetic use. One comment froma manufacturer pointed out that the drug/cosmetic status of a product presentslegal rather than scientific questions, that the labeling of its productscontains only cosmetic claims, and therefore that the products are notdrugs. The comments maintained that it is the intended use of a product,rather than its physical properties, that determines whether the productis a drug or a cosmetic. To support this contention, one comment citedseveral court cases, including <T3>National Nutritional Foods Association </T3>v. <T3>Mathews,</T3> 557 F.2d 325 (2d Cir. 1977); <T3>National Nutritional Foods Association </T3>v. <T3>FDA,</T3> 504 F.2d 761 (2d Cir. 1974); <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>``Sudden Change</T3>,'' 409 F.2d 734 (2d Cir. 1969). The comments addedthat ``FDA's own regulations explicitly recognize that articles representedas hormone skin care products are cosmetics'' and cited 21 CFR 720.4(c)(12)(v).One comment concluded that FDA acted properly in not incorporating intoandSection; 310.530 the Panel's discussion concerning the cosmetic use ofhormone ingredients. The comments requested that the agency clarify thatany regulation adopted as part of the OTC drug review applies to OTC drugproducts and not to cosmetic products for which no drug claims are made.One specific suggestion was that the agency revise the title for proposedandSection; 310.530 to read ``Topically Applied Hormone-Containing Productsfor Over-the-Counter (OTC) Human Drug Use.''The agency agrees that this regulation applies only to topically appliedhormone-containing drug products that fall within the statutory definitionof a drug. A ``drug'' is principally defined in the act as an article ``intendedfor use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention ofdisease'' or ``intended to affect the structure or any function of thebody * * *.'' (See 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), (C).) A ``cosmetic,'' on theother hand, is defined primarily as an article intended to be `` * * *applied to the human body or any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying,promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance * * *.'' (See 21 U.S.C.321(i).) The intended use of a product, therefore, determines whether itis a ``drug,'' a ``cosmetic,'' or both. This intended use may be inferredfrom the product's labeling, promotional material, advertising, and anyother relevant factor. See, e.g., <T3>National Nutritional Foods Ass'n </T3>v. <T3>Mathews,</T3> 557 F.2d 325, 334 (2d Cir. 1977). A manufacturers' subjectiveclaims of intent may be pierced to find its actual intent on the basisof objective evidence. <T3>National Nutritional Foods Ass'n</T3> v. <T3>FDA, supra,</T3> 504 F.2d at 789.The agency believes that the title of andSection; 310.530 clearly statesthat the regulation covers drug products. However, paragraph (a) has beenchanged to clarify that this regulation pertains only to products thatare intended for use as drugs.The agency has reviewed the labeling in current NDAs for skin care productsthat contain estrogen, progesterone, and pregnenolone acetate (refs. 1,2, and 3). One product with labeling submitted by the comment containsestrogen and progesterone and makes the following labeling claim: ``Thiscream (or oil) is scientifically prepared with natural estrogen and progesterone.Contains lubricants and moisturizers to help counteract dryness. Givesthe skin a softer, smoother, more supple look.'' The other product identifiesitself as a cosmetic cream. Although it does not explicitly make any claimsthat would be considered drug claims, its labeling does identify the hormoneingredient as ``pregnenolone acetate.''Skin care products that contain hormones are solely cosmetics if the claimsin the labeling, promotional material, advertising, and other relevantmaterials are only cosmetic in nature (e.g., to promote attractiveness),and no actual or implied therapeutic claims, or claims that the productwill affect the structure or function of the body, are made. The agencyconsiders the use of the word ``hormone'' in the text of the labeling (e.g.,``This cream (or oil) is scientifically formulated to contain a hormone'')or in the ingredient statement to be an implied drug claim. The claim impliedby the use of this term is that the product will have a therapeutic orsome other physiological effect on the body. Therefore, reference to aproduct as a ``hormone cream'' or any statement in the labeling that ``hormones''are present in the product will be considered to be a therapeutic claimfor the product, or a claim that the product will affect the structureor function of the body, and will consequently cause the product to bea drug.If a manufacturer includes a hormone in its product, it may denominatethis ingredient in the labeling by any appropriate name. However, use ofthe chemical name is preferable. For example, for progesterone, the chemicalname is ``pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione;'' and for pregnenolone acetate, the chemicalname is ``3-hydroxypregn-5-ene-20-one acetate.'' Nevertheless, the agencycautions that any statement on the label of a cosmetic product of the presenceof a hormone ingredient, e.g., ``contains natural estrogen and progesterone,''must be consistent with 21 CFR 701.1 and must not be given undue prominence.While andSection; 720.4(c)(12)(v) does list hormone skin care preparationsas a cosmetic product category, such recognition does not preclude regulationof such products as drugs. See also 36 FR 16934; August 26, 1971. A productthat contains hormone ingredients can be either a cosmetic or a drug, orboth, depending on the intended use of the product. If the skin care productsthat contain estrogen, progesterone, and pregnenolone acetate, which arecurrently subject to new drug applications (refs. 1, 2, and 3), were tobe relabeled as discussed above (i.e., no reference to the term ``hormone''),the products could properly be regulated as cosmetics alone. Upon promulgationof a final regulation for OTC hormone-containing drug products, the agencywill publish a notice of opportunity for a hearing on a proposal to withdrawapproval of the NDAs for those products that presently have NDAs but thatare determined not to be safe and effective or that are no longer marketedas drugs.<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) FDA-approved labeling from NDA 10-766, copy in OTC Volume 16GTFM,Docket No. 81N-0144, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) FDA-approved labeling from NDA 11-539, copy in OTC Volume 16GTFM.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) FDA-approved labeling from NDA 12-603, copy in OTC Volume 16GTFM.</ITAG>B. Comments on Hormone Ingredients3. Two comments disagreed with the Panel's conclusions on the safety ofestrogen and progesterone when applied to the skin and objected to thePanel apparently basing its conclusions on the safety of topically appliedestrogen on its judgment that the safety data are ``relatively old'' (47FR 430 at 433). One comment claimed that there is no evidence showing thatthe studies to which the Panel referred are less valid now than when theywere completed, adding that its products, which contain 10,000 InternationalUnits per ounce (I.U./oz) of estrogen, have been marketed OTC under effectivenew drug applications for approximately 24 years with an extremely lowincidence of adverse reactions. Noting that such proof of safety is includedas part of the standards for the safety of an OTC drug in 21 CFR 330.10(a)(4)(i),the comment stated that it appears that the Panel ignored these standardsin reaching its conclusions about the safety of topically applied estrogensat a level of 10,000 I.U./oz. The comment added that its products werereviewed by the National Academy of Science/National Research Council (NAS/NRC)as part of the FDA Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) review, andthat this group of experts did not raise any questions regarding the safetyof these products.The other comment maintained that the Category III classification is inappropriatein view of the evidence cited by the Panel that estrogen does not producesystemic effects and has a low incidence or irritation and allergic effectwhen used at a concentration of 10,000 I.U./oz. The comment also objectedto the Panel's failure to recognize the safety of progesterone at a concentrationof 5 milligrams per ounce (mg/oz). Citing the Panel's statements on thesafety of progesterone at this concentration (47 FR 430 at 433), the commentasked that the agency recognize the safety of progesterone in a concentrationof 5 mg/oz in the next FDA <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication on this subject.The comment added that the regulation should be revised to specify thathigh level estrogen and progesterone concentrations (exceeding 10,000 I.U./ozestrogen and 5 mg/oz progesterone) have not been shown to be generallyrecognized as safe and effective for OTC drug use, and that such concentrationsof hormone ingredients in a product intended for topical OTC drug use wouldrequire an effective NDA. The comment asserted that such action would protectthe public without depriving manufacturers and consumers of effective products.The Panel concluded that inadequate data were submitted to establish thesafety of topically applied estrogens in concentrations up to 10,000 I.U./ozwhen used in amounts not to exceed 2 oz per month (47 FR 430 at 433). Italso pointed out that the lack of systemic effects of concentrations upto 10,000 I.U./oz is well documented in studies, and that these estrogenconcentrations have a low incidence of irritation or allergic local effects.The agency has reviewed all of the data submitted to the Panel, consideredthe data for these products evaluated as part of the DESI review, consideredthe OTC marketing history of these products for over 25 years, and evaluatedthe adverse reaction reports submitted for these products for the last16 years (ref. 1). The agency concludes that estrogens in concentrationsup to 10,000 I.U./oz are safe for topical application to the skin whenused in amounts not to exceed 2 oz per month.The Panel recognized the safety of progesterone at a concentration of 5mg/oz when used in amounts not to exceed 2 oz per month, but concluded``that there was no evidence that using a hormone-containing drug productat the levels which are safe for OTC use will do anything more than usingthe cream vehicle alone'' (47 FR 430 at 433). The agency concurs with thisconclusion. The comments did not submit sufficient data to establish theeffectiveness of either ingredient for OTC drug use. While the agency concurswith the comments that up to 10,000 I.U./oz estrogen and 5 mg/oz progesteroneare safe for OTC use, these ingredients are classified in Category II becauseof a lack of effectiveness for drug use at these concentrations.<ITAG tagnum="74">Reference</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Department of Health Human Services, Food and Drug Administration,Adverse Reaction Summary Listings, pertinent pages for the years 1969-1985,copy in OTC Volume 16GTFM, Docket No. 81N-0144, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG>4. One comment objected to the Panel's statement that it could not locate,nor was it aware of, any data demonstrating the safety and effectivenessof pregnenolone acetate used in topically applied hormone-containing drugproducts for OTC use (47 FR 430 at 432). According to the comment, safetydata on this ingredient are included in an NDA, and the Panel could havereviewed these data. The comment added that annual reports on adverse reactionsfiled with FDA show a low incidence of adverse reactions to pregnenoloneacetate. The comment requested that FDA's preamble and record in this rulemakingproceeding note the existence of an effective NDA for a product containingthis ingredient. The comment also requested that andSection; 310.530(b) berevised to clarify that drug products containing hormones are misbrandedunless they are covered by NDAs.There is an effective NDA (12-603) for a product containing pregnenoloneacetate. However, NDAs were not available to the Panel for review unlessthe holder of the NDA specifically submitted the data it contained to thePanel for evaluation in the OTC drug review. NDA 12-603 became effectivebefore 1962. Thus, it was approved for safety only and not for effectiveness.The product covered by the NDA contains 0.5 percent pregnenolone acetateand was reviewed by the NAS/NRC as part of the FDA DESI review (ref. 1).The agency published the NAS/NRC findings in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of October 2, 1969 (34 FR 15389), stating thatthe products were possibly effective for their labeled indications. Theagency considers concentrations up to 0.5 percent pregnenolone acetateas safe for OTC use, but that there is a lack of evidence that this ingredientis effective at these concentrations. The agency is revising andSection;310.530(b) to clarify that a product covered by the regulation is a newdrug under section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (theact) (21 U.S.C. 321(p)) for which an approved NDA under section 505 ofthe act (21 U.S.C. 355) and part 314 of the regulations (21 CFR part 314)is required for marketing, and in the absence of an approved NDA the productwould be in violation of section 505 and also would be misbranded undersection 502 of the act (21 U.S.C. 352). With respect to NDA 12-603, ifthe product covered by the NDA is relabeled as discussed above, the productcould be regulated as a cosmetic and the NDA withdrawan.

The Agency's Tentative Adoption of the Panel's Report</ITAG>As discussed above, the agency has clarified that the scope of this rulemakingapplies to all topically applied hormone-containing drug products for OTChuman use, to include, but not limited to, estrogens, progestins, androgens,anabolic steroids, and adrenal corticosteroids and synthetic analogs. Theregulation also covers pregnenolone and pregnenolone acetate, steroidsthat are closely related to progesterone in chemical structure and thatexert an estrogen-like action on the skin when applied topically. Withthe exception of hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone acetate used in externalanalgesic drug products, the agency is not aware of any hormone that isgenerally recognized or proposed for general recognition as safe and effectivefor OTC topical drug use. FDA is revising andSection; 310.530(a) to clarifythe scope of the regulation and is adding a new andSection; 310.530(e) toidentify hormones that are not covered by the regulation.The agency is also revising andSection; 310.530(b) to clarify that a productcovered by the regulation is a new drug under section 201(p) of the act(21 U.S.C. 321(p)) for which an approved NDA under section 505 of the act(21 U.S.C. 355) and part 314 of the regulations (21 CFR part 314) is requiredfor marketing, and in the absence of an approved NDA the product wouldbe in violation of section 505 and also would be misbranded under section502 of the act (21 U.S.C. 352). As an alternative, where there are adequatedata establishing general recognition of safety and effectiveness, suchdata may be submitted in a citizen petition to establish a monograph. (See21 CFR 10.30.)The agency has examined the economic consequences of this proposed rulemakingin conjunction with other rules resulting from the OTC drug review. Ina notice published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), the agencyannounced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts.The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resultingfrom the OTC drug review do not constitute a major rule according to thecriteria established by Executive Order 12291. The agency therefore concludesthat no one of these rules, including this proposed rule for OTC topicallyapplied hormone-containing drug products, is a major rule.The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC drug reviewwas not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354). That assessment included a discretionary Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis in the event that an individual rule might impose an unusual ordisproportionate impact on small entities. However, this particular rulemakingfor OTC topically applied hormone-containing drug products is not expectedto pose such an impact on small businesses. Therefore, the agency certifiesthat this proposed rule, if implemented, will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities.The agency invited public comment in the advance notice of proposed rulemakingregarding any impact that this rulemaking would have on OTC topically appliedhormone-containing drug products. No comments on economic impacts werereceived. Any comments on the agency's initial determination of the economicconsequences of this proposed rulemaking should be submitted by January30, 1990. The agency will evaluate any comments and supporting data thatare received and will reassess the economic impact of this rulemaking inthe preamble to the final rule.The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action isof a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significanteffect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required.Interested persons may, on or before December 1, 1989, submit to the DocketsManagement Branch written comments, objections, or requests for oral hearingbefore the Commissioner on the proposed regulation. A request for an oralhearing must specify points to be covered and time requested. Written commentson the agency's economic impact determination may be submitted on or beforeJanuary 30, 1990. Three copies of all comments, objections, and requestsare to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments,objections, and requests are to be identified with the docket number foundin brackets in the heading of this document and may be accompanied by asupporting memorandum or brief.

The authority citation for 21 CFR part 310 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Secs. 501, 502, 503, 505, 701, 704, 705, 52 Stat. 1049-1053as amended, 52 Stat. 1055-1056 as amended, 67 Stat. 477 as amended, 52Stat. 1057-1058 (21 U.S.C. 351, 352, 353, 355, 371, 374, 375); 5 U.S.C.553; 21 CFR 5.10 and 5.11.</ITAG>2. Section 310.530 is added to subpart E to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 310.530</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Topically applied hormone-containing drug products for over-the-counter(OTC) human use. </ITAG>(a) The term ``hormone'' is used broadly to describe a chemical substanceformed in some organ of the body, such as the adrenal glands or the pituitary,and carried to another organ or tissue, where it has a specific effect.Hormones include, for example, estrogens, progestins, androgens, anabolicsteroids, and adrenal corticosteroids and synthetic analogs. Estrogens,progesterone, pregnenolone, and pregnenolone acetate have been presentas ingredients in OTC drug products marketed for topical use as hormonecreams. However, there is a lack of adequate data to establish effectivenessfor any OTC drug use of these ingredients. Therefore, with the exceptionof those hormones identified in paragraph (e) of this section, any OTCdrug product containing an ingredient offered for use as a topically appliedhormone cannot be considered generally recognized as safe and effectivefor its intended use. The intended use of the product may be inferred fromthe product's labeling, promotional material, advertising, and any otherrelevant factor. The use of the word ``hormone'' in the text of the labelingor in the ingredient statement is an implied drug claim. The claim impliedby the use of this term is that the product will have a therapeutic orsome other physiological effect on the body. Therefore, reference to aproduct as a ``hormone cream'' or any statement in the labeling that ``hormones''are present in the product will be considered to be a therapeutic claimfor the product, or a claim that the product will affect the structureor function of the body, and will consequently cause the product to bea drug. (b) Any OTC drug product that is labeled, represented, or promoted as atopically applied hormone-containing product for drug use, with the exceptionof those hormones identified in paragraph (e) of this section, is regardedas a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act, for which an approved new drug application undersection 505 of the act and part 314 of this chapter is required for marketing.In the absence of an approved new drug application, such product is alsomisbranded under section 502 of the act. (c) Clinical investigations designed to obtain evidence that any drug productlabeled, represented, or promoted for OTC use as a topically applied hormone-containingdrug product is safe and effective for the purpose intended must complywith the requirements and procedures governing the use of investigationalnew drugs set forth in part 312 of this chapter. (d) After the effective date of the final regulation, any such OTC drugproduct initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction intointerstate commerce that is not in compliance with this section is subjectto regulatory action. (e) This section does not apply to hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone acetatelabeled, represented, or promoted for OTC topical use in accordance withPart 348 of this chapter.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Frank E.
