<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-59-0103 </DOCNO><TEXT>Measurements of secondary neutron yields and angular distributions releasedby 80 MeV electrons incident on a thick Pb target with moderating indiumfoils are described. The angular distribution of neutrons is isotropicand the yield is (2.20 +- 0.13) x 10{sup 12} n/sxkW; these results agreewith those of the theoretical calculations. The possibility of usingmoderating indium foils to measure the neutron field around the electronlinear accelerator with energy less than 100 MeV is also discussed, andthe answer is positive.</TEXT></DOC>
