In Los Angeles, more than 700 protesters on both sides of theabortion issue demonstrated outside two medical clinics; more than40 abortion opponents were arrested in Woodbridge, N.J.; and 87people were arrested when they blocked a women's clinic inJacksonville, Fla.   Abortion protest drew smaller crowds in Orange County near LosAngeles and in northern California's Sunnyvale, where 16demonstrators were arrested and cited, authorities said.   In Woodbridge, police arrested and carried away some of the 350people who blocked entrances to a medical clinic during a protestdedicated to Nancy Klein, a comatose New York woman who received anabortion Saturday morning in an attempt to help her recover.Anti-abortion activist had tried to stop her husband from becomingher guardian to authorize the procedure.   Members from the Bi-State Operation Rescue Network sat outsidethe clinic, sang religious hymns and hung on the building theirtrademark banner that reads, ``Killing Factory Closed.''   A Woodbridge police dispatcher said Saturday that 44 people werearrested and charged with trespassing. They were released on theirown recognizance after agreeing not to return to the clinic untiltheir cases were heard in municipal court, said the dispatcher, whorefused to give her name.   In Jacksonville, demonstrators blocking the entrance to anabortion clinic went limp when approached by officers, resulting in87 trespass arrests, officials said.   Sheriff's Sgt. Steve Weintraub said the demonstration waspeaceful. He said protesters were taken into custody after they werewarned to leave clinic property. About 200 demonstrators carryingpicket signs remained after the arrests to continue their protest,he said.   In Los Angeles, more than 700 people, opposing and supportingabortion, demonstrated outside two medical clinics, withanti-abortion forces blocking entry to one clinic for several hours.   Police in riot gear stood by but no arrests were made.   The two groups clashed verbally, but no altercations werereported. As the anti-abortion demonstrators locked arms and sanghymns, the pro-choice activists shouted, ``Right to life, yourname's a lie, you don't care if women die.''   ``It was a tremendous success,'' said Joseph Foreman, nationalfield director for Operation Rescue, the anti-abortion group thatsponsored the demonstration.   Counterdemonstrators also claimed success, citing their largeturnout.   ``I think it shows the country that pro-choice activists areready to do battle,'' said Betty Ann Downing of the American CivilLiberties Union, one of the organizers for the Pro-Choice Coalition.</TEXT></DOC>
