He says players will probably sell dollars until they find the &quot;bottom&quot; allowed by the central banks.    Top monetary officials in Japan, while apparently not strongly concerned about the dollar's downturn, have hinted the Bank of Japan is poised to support the dollar if it drops precipitously from current levels.    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Friday the Bank of Japan will intervene in the currency market whenever there are &quot;violent one-day movements&quot; in exchange rates.    Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita also stressed that the central bank &quot;will act appropriately and flexibly&quot; if needed to cope with currency and price movements.    The key word may be flexibly. &quot;As long as markets are not disorderly, I think central banks are quite willing to allow a range&quot; for the dollar, says Robert Chandross, chief economist for Lloyds Bank in New York.    &quot;One would have to assume there's an acquiescence,&quot; he adds, by central bankers in the decline in the dollar after a summer rally based on steadily rising short-term U.S. interest rates.    It's &quot;a little too early to say the dollar is resuming its previous downward trend,&quot; says Anthony Karydakis, money market economist at Mitsubishi Bank here. He agrees, though, that there is &quot;a new element of bearishness in the foreign exchange market vis-a-vis the dollar.&quot;    Behind last week's sharp dollar fall were U.S. economic data indicating a cooling in the U.S. economic growth rate, combined with news of a sharply widened U.S. trade deficit in August. Though traders remain wary of potential central bank activity to bolster the dollar at some point, many traders think the dollar's slide has yet to end.    Mr. Hinton of Barclays says intervention probably won't occur until the dollar threatens to plunge under 1.78 marks and 125 yen.    Late Friday in New York, the dollar stood at 1.7585 marks and 126.55 yen, having slid from 1.8153 marks and 127.43 yen a day earlier. On the week, the dollar was off about six pfennigs and nearly seven yen from 1.8620 marks and 133.30 yen on Oct. 7.    In early trading in Tokyo on Monday, the U.S. unit was changing hands at about 126.60 yen, up a bit from 126.30 yen at the opening, but down from Friday's close of 128.25 yen.    Traders attribute much of Friday's dollar softening to the pound's surge on statements by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. She reiterated her government's intention to bring inflation down, and she said Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson had done the &quot;right thing&quot; in raising interest rates earlier this year. The British base lending rate currently stands at 12%.    Late Friday, the pound stood at $1.7463. It strengthened from $1.7505 a day earlier despite reports the Bank of England had sold modest amounts of pounds for dollars.    The rise sparked the dollar's fall under key technical support at 1.8100 marks, which fueled more bearish sentiment toward the U.S. currency.    Aside from the pound's rally, traders say, the dollar was also hurt Friday by September U.S. retail sales and industrial production figures that fell short of market expectations. While the U.S. economy is not seen as weak, traders are disappointed that recent data have not shown the &quot;momentum&quot; needed to induce tighter monetary policy, says Stephen Leach, a currency analyst for Chemical Bank.    Mr. Leach thinks central banks won't intervene by buying dollars in the near future unless the dollar's fall significantly accelerates. &quot;The central banks will be in if things move sharply,&quot; he said, but &quot;the central banks are not against gradual moves.&quot; He believes central bankers are &quot;not uncomfortable&quot; with the dollar trading in broad ranges of 1.75 to 1.90 marks and 120 to 135 yen.    Of course, not everyone forecasts the dollar will move lower in coming days. The dollar &quot;is overdone on the downside,&quot; says Peter Cardillo, a commodity trading adviser for Josephthal andamp; Co. &quot;I just can't imagine the dollar going much lower,&quot; he says, predicting a techncial correction that could lift the dollar to 1.8280 marks and 129.50 yen in coming days.    But the dollar outlook could turn increasingly bearish after the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, says Nariman Behravesh, senior vice president for world-wide macroeconomic services at WEFA Group in Philadelphia. &quot;The trade deficit will take a while to turn around,&quot; he says.    Another potential bearish influence for the dollar is the lack of a well-regarded budget deficit reduction plan from either presidential candidate. If there's no significant progress after the election in slicing the budget gap, officials of the U.S.'s major allies may allow only a short &quot;honeymoon&quot; for the new president before pressuring for further action.    On the New York Commodity Exchange Friday, gold for current delivery settled at $409.10 an ounce, up $2.20. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.2 million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Monday, gold was quoted at $411.15 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
