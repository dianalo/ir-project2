U.S. attorney Daniel Lopez Romo said late Thursday that themoney was believed inside drums dug up two weeks ago in a farmer'sfield in Vega Baja, 35 miles northwest of San Juan.   Lopez said officials became suspicious after residents beganbuying luxury items with ``great sums'' of cash.   Authorities found one drum with $1.5 million still inside butothers had been emptied, he said. Newspapers said between 10 and 11empty drums were found nearby.   ``So you can speculate that we're talking about extraordinaryamounts of money,'' Lopez said.   ``The FBI is interviewing a number of people to find out wherethe money came from and what legal action to take,'' he said. ``Butwe can't make anything public about the investigation.''   Newspapers reported residents were snapping up new houses,boats, cars and VCRs with the cash. They said federal authoritiesdescended on the town after a car mechanic paid $170,000 cash for ahouse and a sports car, and deposited $50,000 cash in a bank.   Lopez said the FBI interviewed several people and many localresidents were returning goods bought with the found cash.   Many also weren't, he said.   El Vocero, the tabloid that broke the story, said the FBI hadconfiscated ``millions'' _ mostly in $100 and $20 bills _ fromresidents and from the drum recovered by agents.   Vega Baja, a bustling community of 30,000 nestled between apristine beach overlooking the Atlantic Ocean and tropical hills,was quiet Thursday and few residents would talk about the money.Most said they didn't know anything about it.   City Hall was closed and many shops shuttered their doors earlyin preparation for Good Friday. Parents took children to the beachand fishermen climbed atop coral hills to cast for red snapper.   ``If I found that money, I wouldn't have touched it for anythingin the world. It's dirty money _ that's for sure. Something realfishy about it,'' said one woman who ran an outdoor cafe and gaveher name only as Carmen.   There was some confusion as to where the money had actually beenburied. Many said the beach. Others said a field.   Lopez said the location of the buried treasure couldn't berevealed because ``there would be a gold rush to the site.''   ``We can't give that information. We shouldn't and we won't,''he said.   The U.S. attorney said it was a good bet the cash was drugtrafficking money.   ``That's one of the strongest possibilities, but I can't saywith certainty,'' he said. ``It's probable that somebody knew whereit was buried and blew the whistle.''   El Vocero quoted unidentified sources as saying the Puerto RicoJustice Department had estimated up to $20 million may have beenburied.   Miguel Rodriguez, a police narcotics agent in Vega Baja, saidThursday a car and a motorcycle had been turned in to FBI agentsinvestigating the case.   ``This is so confidential the FBI is not even telling usanything,'' Rodriguez said. ``There is a report of lots of moneyfloating around, but we don't know from where.''   The FBI office in the capital of San Juan has refused to discussthe case until the investigation is completed. Because theCaribbean island of Puerto Rico is a U.S. commonwealth, itsinvestigatory matters come under federal jurisdiction.   Under Puerto Rican law, anyone who finds treasure on privateproperty is entitled to half, with the remainder going to thecommonwealth.   But the FBI could invoke a federal law entitling the U.S.government to confiscate funds tied to the illegal drug trade topay for the costs of the investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
