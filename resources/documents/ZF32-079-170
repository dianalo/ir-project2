OskiandM;Pacer Software Inc.'s PacerTerm is the first new commercialtelecommunications program to come along in quite a while.andP;  It hascapabilities that make it attractive as a general-purpose communicationsprogram and as a tool for creating custom interfaces to host computersystems.andM;PacerTerm is the first product to access all of the utility of the MacintoshCommunications Toolbox in addition to providing scripting andinterface-customization facilities.andM;Many software vendors have adopted the Comm Toolbox as a common platform forcommunications applications, because it offers multiple, simultaneoussessions and an extensible framework.andP;  Starting with the basic terminal, filetransfer and connection components that the Comm Toolbox provides, vendorscan focus on building sophisticated functions.andP;  The Comm Toolbox is builtinto System 7.0; users of System 6 will have to install it with the disksPacer provides.andM;Building with blocks.andP;  PacerTerm is hardly a plug-and-play application.andO;While the sample settings files are helpful, knowledge of communications andsubstantial effort are required to achieve the most basic communicationsutility.andM;To create a new settings file, you must configure the Comm Toolbox extensions(&quot;tools&quot;) via a dialog box reminiscent of System 6's Control Panel deskaccessory.andP;  First, you set up terminal emulation (TTY, VT102 or VT320),screen size and keyboard characteristics.andP;  Next, you select the type ofconnection and appropriate parameters.andP;  PacerTerm supports Apple-standardtools for dial-up modems, direct serial links and AppleTalk networks.andP;  Paceralso provides tools for Telnet; LAT (Local-Area Transport); TCP/IP; and thecompany's own VAX-based service, PacerCT.andM;Users of VMS and Unix systems with network connections will make use of LAT,PacerCT and PacerTCP support, while those with more-typicaltelecommunications requirements will stick with the Apple Modem Tool, ageneric interface for Hayes-compatible modems.andM;The final step is to select a file transfer type from PacerTerm's limitedlist of protocols.andP;  The program supports text, Xmodem, Super Kermit (withsliding windows) and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) transfers, as well as theproprietary PacerFT protocol.andP;  The company plans to have a Zmodem toolavailable this year.andP;  Protocol tools are simply system extensions, so newones can be added at will.andM;Smooth scripting.andP;  PacerTerm's scripting language is the means by which thefull power of PacerTerm is realized; PacerScript is essentially HyperTalkwith communications-related additions.andP;  Although it lacks references toobjects, such as cards, that are foreign to PacerTerm's interface, it isremarkably full-featured and accessible.andP;  PacerScript can be extended usingHyperCard-compatible external commands (XCMDs) and external functions(XFCNs).andM;A &quot;watch me&quot; mode records your actions into an editable script for a faststart on script creation.andP;  The script editor offers many features we'd liketo see in HyperCard's own script editor.andP;  Script commands can be typed in orselected from lists; any command or function, as well as any control,terminal or dialog procedure, can be accessed via a scrolling list or pop-upmenu.andP;  The tracing debugger is useful, but it is annoyingly sluggish whenexecuting long or complex scripts.andP;  Indeed, execution of all PacerTermscripts is leisurely, even on 68030-based Macs.andM;Customization.andP;  PacerScript can be used to create custom dialog boxes, afeature critical to creating well-designed front-end interfaces.andO;Significantly, these dialog boxes can be summoned by commands sent from thehost computer.andP;  This is a powerful feature, but since dialog boxes areaccessible only via PacerScript commands, creating them can be atime-consuming process.andM;Without resorting to scripting, you can control a floating palette of 20buttons, called SoftKeys.andP;  Any button can be set to send out specified text,execute a script or call up an alternate palette.andP;  What you decide to do withthe SoftKeys will depend largely on the host and the functions you performregularly.andP;  Command keys can be remapped to offer keyboard equivalents to theSoftKeys, so both keyboard- and mouse-oriented users are accommodated.andM;While similar flexibility can be achieved by pairing general-purposecommunications programs, such as The Freesoft Company's White Knight orSoftware Ventures Corp.'s MicroPhone II, with CE Software Inc.'s QuicKeys,the capability to easily mix and match multiple SoftKey and key-mappingdefinitions with any terminal settings file would be difficult to duplicate.andM;Despite its innovative and powerful features, PacerTerm is in some ways anunfinished product.andP;  The release notes, which include a list of known bugs inaddition to the usual last-minute changes, rival one of the three manuals inlength.andP;  The manuals that make up the remainder of the documentation arewell-written, although the Communications Tools Guide would benefit from anindex.andM;We couldn't duplicate all the bugs reported in the release notes, but we didencounter numerous anomalies that we attribute to bad memory management.andP;  Forexample, we received warnings of low memory and were unable to copy evensmall selections to the Clipboard regardless of how much memory PacerTerm hadavailable.andM;Users of other telecommunications programs may be frustrated when trying tocontrol their modems more directly than PacerTerm allows.andP;  Also, eachsettings document can contain only one phone number, so you must createseparate settings files even for services with similar interfaces andtransfer protocols.andP;  Finally, the terminal scroll-back buffer is fixed at asmall size, so you're likely to lose the record of your on-line sessionunless you capture it to a text file.andM;Conclusions.andP;  PacerTerm shows substantial potential, but the absence of somecomponents and the instability of some modules make us hesitant to recommendthe program in its debut incarnation.andM;The extensible, multisession Comm Toolbox capabilities, along with thefamiliarity of HyperTalk-based scripting, are powerful draws, but theproduct's bugginess and some design limits hurt it.andP;  Although it's pricedcompetitively compared with other telecommunications programs, PacerTerm isnot ready to compete in that market.andM;For sites with Mac-to-VAX or Mac-to-Unix networks, however, PacerTermprovides flexibility in creating customized interfaces to host applicationsat a low price.andM;PacerTerm also can be controlled from the host, which adds anotheropportunity for embellishing terminal-based applications.andP;  In this market,PacerTerm is easier to use and far less expensive than other options.andP;  Forthese users, we judge it a good value.andM;Pacer Software Inc. is at 7911 Herschel Ave., Suite 402, La Jolla, Calif.andO;92037.andP;  Phone (619) 454-0565; fax (619) 454-6267.andM;PacerTermandM;Pacer Software Inc.andM;Although its price and features peg PacerTerm as a general-purposetelecommunications program, it is best used for VAX and Unix connections.andO;Based on the Communications Toolbox and HyperTalk scripting language,PacerTerm also offers programmable dialog boxes, on-screen palettes andkeyboard remapping.andP;  The first release is flawed, but it is inexpensivecompared with other front-end systems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
