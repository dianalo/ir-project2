(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Upjohn Co. is demanding in a lawsuit thata California company withdraw from the market a product used toprevent a disease in pigs.   Upjohn said Wednesday that Syntro Corp. of San Diego infringed onUpjohn's patent for a bioengineered virus used as a vaccine againstpseudorabies in swine.   Upjohn obtained the patent Tuesday and filed suit the same day inU.S. District Court in Delaware against Syntro, Upjohn spokeswomanMaury Ewalt said.   But Syntro has its own patent application pending and denies itinfringed on Upjohn's patent, Jack Fitzpatrick, Syntro's chieffinancial officer, said today.   Upjohn said Syntro's pseudorabies vaccine has characteristicssimilar to the genetically engineered virus used to make Upjohn'sTOLVID vaccine.   Ewalt said TOLVID was approved in 1987 by the U.S. Department ofAgriculture and has been marketed since last year for protection ofpigs against pseudorabies.   ``We are going to take all the necessary steps to vigorouslyprotect a very extensive research and development effort which ledto our product,'' Thomas Schalk, vice president of Upjohn'sagricultural division, said in a news release.   ``The issues are not at all clear cut,'' Fitzpatrick said. Hesaid Syntro is preparing a response to Upjohn's suit. The Syntrovaccine was introduced in April 1988 and is marketed in eight to 10states where pseudorabies in swine is a major problem, he said.   The viral infection causes symptoms including weight loss,crippling and miscarriages in adult pigs and can be fatal to pigsunder 2 years old. It does not affect humans, Ewalt said.</TEXT></DOC>
