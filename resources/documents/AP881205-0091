But another blaze, which almost burned the historic Old Faithfulcomplex at the park and threatened West Yellowstone, Mont., wasimpossible to control, the reports said.   In all, the 10 major fires that cut a swath of flames throughYellowstone burned about 706,000 acres. The latest report Fridayindicated the fires covered much less than the 1 million-acreestimate given in September.   The new figures, based on satellite pictures assessed last week,indicate that about 32 percent of the 2.2 million-acre park burned.   By underestimating drought conditions, Yellowstone firefightersmissed an early opportunity to stop the Clover-Mist fire in thenortheast corner of the park, which threatened Cooke City, aninteragency review team said. Instead of their own observations,park and national forest officials relied on fire informationgathered since the early 1970s, the report said.   The Clover and Mist fires eventually merged and burned 309,600acres in the park and national forests.   Another team that looked at the North Fork fire on the park'swestern edge, which threatened the Old Faithful area, concluded thatno amount of resources would have stopped it.   The reports were prepared by National Park Service and U.S.Forest Service fire specialists who interviewed managers and firebosses.   The Clover and Mist fires started July 9 and July 11.   ``At this time, the park could have suppressed both fires withinitial action forces,'' the report said. ``Projected spread andworst-case analysis underestimated the potential of these fires tocross the Continental Divide onto the Shoshone National Forest.''   Dan Sholly, Yellowstone's chief ranger, said historic weathertrends showing rains in July and August led park officials tounderestimate fire conditions. But he noted that even the country'sbest fire experts underestimated fire conditions later in the summer.   ``We're mortals,'' he said.   Dick Hodge, forest ranger on the Clearwater National Forest inPotlatch and a member of the review team, said that the first fivedays, July 9-14, were the only chance park officials had to stop theblazes.   ``After that it had grown big enough that we doubted they couldhave controlled it completely,'' Hodge said in a phone interview.   The North Fork fire started July 22 when a wood cutter dropped acigarette in the Targhee National Forest. It quickly spread andbulldozers were not allowed inside the park during the initialattack.   But with spot fires detected up to a half mile ahead of the firethe next day, Troy Kurth, the Yellowstone Area fire commander,judged that bulldozer lines would not hold the fire.   ``There could have been a loss of equipment, crews in danger andunnecessary damage to the environment,'' the report said. ``The endresult, an escaped fire, would have been the same.''   The review team went even further in supporting the firefightingeffort by park and fire bosses.   ``Using more resources, in most instances, would not have led togreater control of the main fire,'' they said in the report.   The North Fork and Wolf Lake fires eventually covered more than500,000 acres in Yellowstone and Targhee National Forest.   The review teams submitted their reports Friday to the GreaterYellowstone Coordinating Committee in Denver. The committee willpresent reports to the larger interagency group that is preparing afinal report on the fires for Congress and the secretaries of theinterior and agriculture. It is due for release Dec. 15.</TEXT></DOC>
