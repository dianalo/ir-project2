At a White House briefing, the president called the plan,which took 18 months of public hearings and internaladministration debate to produce, a strategy for &quot;an energyfuture that is secure, efficient and environmentally sound.&quot;While several industry groups welcomed the plan,environmentalists and some lawmakers blasted it for relyingtoo heavily on production and too little on conservation toreduce import demand.</LP><TEXT>   With the Persian Gulf war refocusing congressionalattention on energy, some sort of legislation aimed atbolstering energy security and reducing the nation'svulnerability to oil shocks is expected to pass this year.Outlines of the administration's energy plan have been knownfor weeks, but release of the details will open the hardbargaining on Capitol Hill.   &quot;There will be a battle royal over energy policy,&quot; saidSen. Albert Gore (D., Tenn.), who criticized theadministration for failing to propose tougher conservationprovisions. Several lawmakers, however, said the presidentdeserved credit for proposing a comprehensive plan.   Without mentioning the war, Mr. Bush said, &quot;We want tobuild an energy future that's based on a range of diversesources so that never again will this nation's energywell-being be swayed by events in any single foreigncountry.&quot;   According to the strategy, however, the U.S. and the worldare likely to &quot;depend more on Middle East oil suppliers underany realistic scenario for the foreseeable future.&quot; Theadministration says that two-thirds of the world's proven oilreserves are in the Gulf region, and production in otherregions is expected to decline.   In 1989, about 21% of U.S. oil imports came from thePersian Gulf. The U.S. imports about 42% of its oil today, upfrom a low of around 27% in 1985.   To encourage domestic energy production, the presidentcalls for opening portions of the Arctic National WildlifeRefuge and certain other Alaskan and offshore areas toexploration; revamping nuclear plant licensing; and reducingthe regulation of natural gas and oil pipelines. The planalso would boost research spending on energy technology,including electric vehicles and high-speed rail lines, andextend a tax credit for investments in renewable-energytechnologies.   The production provisions are expected to boost domesticoil output by 3.8 million barrels a day by 2010 aboveprojected levels. According to a 1990 Energy Departmentprojection, domestic production would fall to between 4.1million and 5.6 million barrels a day in 2010 from 7.7million in 1989.   The strategy calls for pursuing diplomatic and tradeinitiatives to spur increased oil production in South Americaand Europe. It would remove barriers to natural gas imports.The American Gas Association called the plan &quot;a major steptoward an effective and balanced energy policy.&quot; The plan isalso likely to please oil companies, which have pushed hardfor opening new areas to production.   The centerpiece on the conservation side, which issupposed to reduce demand by 3.4 million barrels a day by2010, is a plan to significantly increase the percentage offleet vehicles that use nongasoline fuels such as naturalgas. Among other provisions, the administration also plans tomake clear that discounts that utilities give to customerswho make investments in energy efficiency wouldn't be subjectto federal tax, and to encourage state programs thatencourage the scrapping of old, gas-guzzling cars.   To the dismay of conservation groups, however, theadministration rejected proposals to require greater autofuel efficiency, an idea with considerable support on CapitolHill. Instead, the plan calls for a study of the issue. Atthe White House briefing, Energy Secretary James Watkins saidhigher fuel efficiency requirements wouldn't produce fuelsavings nearly as great as proponents suggest.   More broadly, he said the administration had a &quot;basicphilosophical disagreement&quot; with critics who have called forhigher energy taxes and forced conservation measures toreduce dependence on foreign oil. Such measures, he said,would reduce the nation's standard of living and economiccompetitiveness.   The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmentalgroup, said the president's strategy would increase oil use,energy costs and emissions of carbon dioxide, which is theprime cause in suspected global warming.</TEXT></DOC>
