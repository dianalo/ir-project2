Police Chief Isaac Fulwood believes the department andthen-chief Maurice Turner were right to drop the matter after theallegation could not be corroborated, sources told The WashingtonPost.   A Howard University psychiatrist reportedly told policeinvestigators in 1984 that the mayor suffered from a drug overdosein 1983.   Barry, in an effort Monday to quell the overdose allegations,let reporters review 154 pages of medical records. But the recordswere withdrawn after an hour and many reporters complained it wasimpossible to draw conclusions from them.   Barry's spokeswoman said the records were released tosubstantiate the mayor's statements that he suffered from a hiatalhernia in 1983 and not a cocaine overdose.   The records indicated that doctors diagnosed Barry's illness asa hiatal hernia, an abnormality of the digestive tract that cancause symptoms similar to those of a heart attack.   None of the records showed that Barry was tested for thepresence of cocaine or that illegal drugs caused hishospitalization.   Medical experts told the Post the symptoms identified in Barry'srecords were consistent with several illnesses, including a hiatalhernia, heart disease and a cocaine overdose.</TEXT></DOC>
