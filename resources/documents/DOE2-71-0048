<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-71-0048 </DOCNO><TEXT>Ultrasonographic, computed tomographic, and angiographic abnormalitiesof nodular regenerative hyperplasia have been described in very few cases.We report here the case of a 50-year-old man with round, well-limitedhypoechogenic lesions involving the two lobes of the liver, and hypervascular,poorly delineated angiographic lesions. Computed tomography and magneticresonance of the liver were normal. Histological examination of largeliver specimens provided by intraoperative biopsy allowed the diagnosisof nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Such a pseudo-tumoral ultrasonographicand angiographic pattern must be recognized in order to avoid diagnosticand therapeutic mistakes, especially since percutaneous liver biopsyusually fails to diagnose this disease.</TEXT></DOC>
