The Commission received ten requestsfor rehearing of the rule.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The State of California <T3>ex rel. </T3>Resources Agency and the State Water Resources ControlBoard, the Commonwealth of Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection,the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, the New York State Departmentof Environmental Conservation, the State of Minnesota Department of NaturalResources, and American Rivers <T3>et al. </T3>filed timely rehearing requests. The State of Montana,the State of Washington Department of Ecology, the Northwest Power PlanningCouncil, and the State of Oregon filed requests for rehearing out of time.The Commission is considering these as requests for reconsideration.1.The interpretative rule exception to the APAThe final rule was issued without prior notice and comment under the interpretativerule exception to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\5\<NOTE/> The APA generally requires an agency to publish notice ofa proposed rulemaking in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and give interested persons an opportunity tocomment on the proposed action before issuing a final rule.\6\<NOTE/> These requirements, however, do not apply to ``interpretativerules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedureor practice * * *.'' \7\<NOTE/> Most of the petitioners for rehearing argue that the finalrule does not fall within the interpretative rule exception to the APA.They argue that the rule imposed requirements for these plans that werenot contained in ECPA and that the rule was therefore not interpretativein nature.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ 5 U.S.C. 551 <T3>et seq.</T3> (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>Id.</T3>The Commission disagrees. Since the final rule merely stated the Commission'sinterpretation of a comprehensive plan under ECPA, the Commission believesthe rule was properly issued under the interpretative rule exception tothe APA.2. Comprehensive plan criteriaIn the final rule, the Commission stated that Congress intended that astate plan would fall within the scope of section 10(a)(2)(A) of the FPAonly if the plan were prepared and adopted pursuant to a specific act ofthe state legislature and were developed, implemented, and managed by theappropriate state agency. The final rule also codified the Commission'sconclusion in <T3>Fieldcrest Mills, Inc.</T3>\8\<NOTE/> that plans within the scope of section 10(a)(2)(A) should``reflect the preparers' own balancing of the competing uses of a waterway.''The rule pointed out that the weight to be accorded any plan, whether ornot it qualifies as a state comprehensive plan, depends on its supportingdocumentation, since Commission findings must be based on substantial evidence.\9\<NOTE/> The rule then set forth general guidelines with respect towhat type of plan would carry the most weight in the Commission's licensingdecisions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ 37 FERC andpara; 62,264 (1986).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ <T3>See</T3> section 313(b) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. 825<T3>l</T3>(b).The petitioners assert that the final rule interprets section 10(a)(2)(A)incorrectly by drawing overly restrictive requirements for qualifying comprehensiveplans. Their arguments are based on the statutory language of section 10(a)(2)and on its legislative history.Five petitioners \10\<NOTE/> point out that section 10(a)(2)(A) refers to comprehensiveplans ``for improving, developing, <T3>or</T3> conserving'' waterways (emphasis added), and that thereforethese plans should not be required to balance all relevant public usesof the waterways. Rather, they reason that a plan, for example, that isconcerned only with identifying reaches of rivers that should be protectedfrom all forms of development should also qualify under section 10(a)(2)(A).These petitioners refer by way of contrast to the language of section 10(a)(1),which requires that projects to be licensed shall be such as in the judgmentof the Commission will be best adapted to a comprehensive plan for a varietyof beneficial public uses that are linked with the conjunctive ``and,''not the disjunctive ``or.'' \11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ State of California, Kentucky Department for EnvironmentalProtection, Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, Minnesota Department ofNatural Resources, and American Rivers, <T3>et al.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Section 10(a)(1) provides that projects to be licensedshall be such as in the judgment of the Commission will be best adaptedto a comprehensive plan for improving <T3>or</T3> developing a waterway or waterways for the use <T3>or</T3> benefit of interstate or foreign commerce, for the improvement<T3>and</T3> utilization of water power development, for the adequate protection,mitigation, and enhancement of fish and wildlife (including related spawninggrounds and habitat), and for other beneficial public uses, including irrigation,flood control, water supply, and recreational and other purposes referredto in section 4(e) * * *. [Emphasis added.]Two petitioners \12\<NOTE/> also argue that requiring section 10(a)(2)(A) comprehensiveplans to consider and balance all beneficial uses of a waterway renders``conflicting or redundant'' the requirement of section 10(a)(2)(B) ofthe FPA that the Commission consider the ``recommendations of * * * Stateagencies exercising administration over flood control, navigation, irrigation,recreation, cultural and other relevant resources of the State in whichthe project is located * * *.'' California asserts that state comprehensiveplans would always be subsumed within the state recommendations obtainedpursuant to section 10(a)(2)(B).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ State of Oregon and State of California.Finally, American Rivers, <T3>et al.</T3> takes issue with the Commission's conclusion, as expressedin its order in <T3>Fieldcrest Mills, Inc.</T3> and in Order No. 481, that a comprehensiveplan must be prepared and adopted pursuant to a specific act of the statelegislature. American Rivers, <T3>et al.</T3> reasons that a comprehensive plan should qualify so longas a state agency is legally competent as a matter of state law to preparesuch a plan.The issue before the Commission is whether Congress, in enacting section10(a)(2)(A) of ECPA, intended state and Federal comprehensive plans toconsider and balance all relevant beneficial uses of a waterway, or whetherCongress intended that such plans could deal with some, or only one, beneficialuse.The Commission recognizes that there is an ambiguity of intent reflectedin the statutory language and the legislative history. However, it is notnecessary to resolve this ambiguity, because, as a matter of policy, theCommission will accord section 10(a)(2)(A) treatment to state and Federalplans that consider one, or more, or all beneficial public uses of a waterway.In so doing, it will ensure that all state and Federal river programs andpolicies will be fully considered in the Commission's licensing decision.With respect to the argument of American Rivers, <T3>et al.</T3> opposing the requirement of a specific act of the statelegislature, the Commission's position was guided by the pre-passage remarksof Committee Chairman McClure, who stated that the provision would requirethe Commission to consider the extent to which a proposed plan was consistentwith a state comprehensive plan ``as established by an act of the Statelegislature and developed, implemented and managed by an appropriate Stateagency.'' \13\<NOTE/> No state petitioner objected to the Commission's interpretationon this point. However, we are satisfied that, as the Senate Report states,the plan must merely be ``prepared by appropriate agencies as authorizedto conduct such planning pursuant to * * * State law.'' \14\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ 99 CONG. REC. S4140 (April 11, 1986).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ S. REP. NO. 99-161, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 8-9 (1985).The Conference Report refers to comprehensive plans ``developed by otherentities pursuant to State or Federal law * * * .'' H.R. REP. NO. 99-934at 22.In sum, the Commission will treat as a comprehensive plan under section10(a)(2)(A) of the FPA a plan that (1) is prepared by an agency establishedby Federal law that has the authority to prepare such a plan, or by a stateagency authorized to conduct such planning pursuant to state law; (2) isa comprehensive study of one or more of the beneficial uses of a waterwayor waterways; (3) articulates the standards applied, the data relied upon,and the methodology used; and (4) is filed with the Secretary of the Commission.It also bears repeating that, as we stated in Order No. 481, even if astate or Federal plan does not qualify as a comprehensive plan under section10(a)(2)(A), the Commission will consider the plan, as it considers allrelevant studies and recommendations, in its public interest analysis pursuantto section 10(a)(1).The Commission notes the Conference Report, which states: \15\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ H.R. REP. NO. 99-934 at 22.<ITAG tagnum="21">[The bill] incorporates a new section 10(a)(2), expressly requiringFERC to consider comprehensive plans developed by other entities pursuantto State or Federal law, as well as recommendations of Federal and Stateagencies and Indian tribes with expertise on aspects of the public interest.It is not an exclusive list of values FERC must evaluate and address inorder to satisfy its comprehensive planning responsibilities. However,it highlights the steps the Commission must take to inform itself regardingthe needs and uses of the river in question. Other steps the Commissionwould have to take, depending on particular circumstances, include addressingfish and wildlife management and restoration plans for the river drainageand accom[m]odating the views of other interested parties.</ITAG>Congress, in enacting ECPA, thus affirmed the Commission's ``responsibilityto resolve competing demands in the public interest.'' \16\<NOTE/> This means that, whereas the Commission has the clear dutyto give full consideration to the recommendations submitted in a licensingproceeding, no one recommendation_or comprehensive plan under section 10(a)(2)(A)_canveto a proposed project.\17\<NOTE/> Moreover, the fewer the beneficial uses of a waterway thata state or Federal plan has considered and balanced, the less weight willbe attached to a proposed project's inconsistency with the plan, sincethe Commission is required to consider and balance all beneficial usesof a waterway. The Commission therefore encourages states and Federal agenciesto develop plans that study and balance as many uses as possible and provideas much data as possible. However, all plans, based on articulated standardsand data, will assuredly enhance the Commission's decisionmaking processby giving it the benefit of the planners' analyses and policy judgments.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ <T3>Id.</T3> at 25.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ <T3>Cf. id.</T3> at 23 (``Section 10(j) does not give [fish and wildlife]agencies a veto * * * ''); Escondido Mutual Water Co. v.

The Director will request thestates and Federal agencies to file with the Commission the plans theybelieve meet the policy criteria set forth in this order. The Directorwill, within a reasonable period of time, advise the filer whether a planmeets the policy criteria, and if not, why not. If necessary in order tomake a determination, the Director may ask the filer to submit additionalinformation with respect to a plan. The Commission staff will also be available,on request, to discuss comprehensive planning with state and Federal personnel.As a final matter, the Commission notes the request of the Northwest PowerPlanning Council that the Commission clarify whether the Council's ColumbiaRiver Basin Fish and Wildlife Program and the Northwest Conservation andElectric Power Plan are comprehensive plans within the final rule. TheCommission found that these two plans were comprehensive plans within themeaning of ECPA in <T3>Utah Power andamp; Light Company.</T3>\18\<NOTE/> The Commission is clarifying that, as a policy matter, itwill treat the Council's Program and Plan as comprehensive plans undersection 10(a)(2)(A).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ 40 FERC andpara; 61,139 (1987).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 18 CFR Part 2</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Electric power, Environmental impactstatements, Natural gas, Pipelines, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.In consideration of the foregoing, the Commission amends Part 2, ChapterI, Title 18, Code of Federal Regulations, as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lois D.
