Ranieri, who was deposed last year as the head of Salomon Inc.'s mortgage and real-estate group, is setting up a $1 billion-plus firm that will compete with his former employer.    Mr. Ranieri declined to comment on his plans, but sources familiar with his operation said his new company, which is still in the process of formation, will focus on investment banking for financial companies, real-estate finance, and investments in commercial real estate and financial companies.    Although the investments will at first be scattered and entrepreneurial in nature, the sources said the ultimate goal is to create a new, broad-based financial institution.    Financing for the new company isn't yet completed, but Mr. Ranieri has letters of intent from several investors. He has been widely rumored to be in discussion with members of the Bass family of Texas, as well as other wealthy individuals and institutional investors.    Meanwhile, Mr. Ranieri has already hired several employees and has begun working with clients. As previously reported, Scott Shay and Sheppard Davis, both former employees of Mr. Ranieri's at Salomon, have left to join him. Patricia Sloan, another ex-Salomon executive, has also joined the firm, as well as several people from other Wall Street firms.    Kendrick R. Wilson III, who was head of investment banking at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., also is rumored to be planning to join Mr. Ranieri's new venture. Mr. Wilson, who before moving to Hutton also worked with Mr. Ranieri at Salomon, acknowledged that he has been advising Mr. Ranieri on his new company. &quot;He's a close friend,&quot; he said.    Officials at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., which bought Hutton last December, had said Mr. Wilson was one of the Hutton officials they wanted to retain -- an effort that apparently has failed. Mr. Wilson said he is leaving the firm next week, but hasn't yet made any decisions about his future career.    Since Mr. Ranieri was forced out of Salomon last July -- one of the first signs of the power struggles that have wracked that firm recently -- market gossip has linked him to many rumored takeovers of major financial institutions. Yesterday, in fact, he was said to be plotting a takeover of his former employer, Salomon. When reached for comment, Mr. Ranieri refused to discuss his plans but said he hasn't any intention of taking over Salomon.    In another recent instance, a friendly visit to First Boston Corp. sparked rumors he was planning to go to work for his old rival.    Behind the rumors lie not only Mr. Ranieri's star status in the financial industry, but also his well-known ability to raise money. Within weeks of his dismissal from Salomon, friends say, he had offers of over $2 billion in financing. Sources say the delay in announcing his new project stems largely from his three-month respiratory illness last fall, not from any shortage of potential investors.    In what may be an act of faith, the not-yet-formed company has already leased 15,000 square feet of space in Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s recently vacated lower Manhattan headquarters. The rapidly expanding operation, currently in temporary quarters, plans to move in as soon as the space is ready. </TEXT></DOC>
