<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-80-0068 </DOCNO><TEXT>A {gamma}-ray spectrometer with three large HpGe crystals totalling 560cm/sup 3/ in one cryostat was fabricated with a view to achieving ultralowbackground count rates in the energy region below 4 MeV. At 2 MeV, thecontinuum background is 1.7x10/sup -3/ counts per keV per 1000 h percm/sup 3/, making this one of the lowest background, large systems atthe present time. Only passive shielding is used. Residual activitiesintrinsic to the detector and shielding materials have been identifiedwith respect to their origin from fission and cosmogenic sources.</TEXT></DOC>
