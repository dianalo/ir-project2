Ambient levels were established by sampling six consecutivedays each quarter for one year. The non-criteria pollutants of particularinterest in this study included metals, vapor phase chloride and fluoride,polychorinated dibenzofurands and dibenzodioxins, polychorinated biphenyls,polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and volatile organics. Methodologyused was designed to provide data at levels low enough to adequatelydefine ambient concentrations. Multiple sampling and analysis techniqueswere compared to identify the most useful technique for each analyte.Field blanks and field spikes were used to define the applicability ofeach method for the target analytes. Very low levels of the non-criteriapollutants were observed in the ambient air. Sample volumes and detectionlimits established during this project were sufficient to characterizethe compounds of interest at ambient levels.</TEXT></DOC>
