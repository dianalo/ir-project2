Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, who was among thoseattending a symposium on the subject Tuesday, said the natural gasindustry has been timid too long.   ``The squeaky wheel gets the oil, but natural gas hasn't beensqueaky enough,'' Mauro said. ``It's not told its story loudenough.''   Oilman T. Boone Pickens, general partner of Mesa LimitedPartnership, told the gathering the domestic oil industry willnever return to its former glory.   ``There's not much future for the domestic oil industry,''Pickens said. ``But there is a lot of potential for the natural gasindustry.''   Many of those attending the daylong symposium agreed thatnatural gas, the cleanest-burning fossil fuel, can play animportant role in efforts to rid cities of pollutants from industryand vehicle emissions.   Daniel Weiss, a representative of the Sierra Club, said hisgroup would support the use of natural gas in legislation aimed atcleaning up the environment.   But officials said a significant switch to natural gas or otheralternate fuels by power plants or automobiles is still years away.   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., said some pressure could come thisfall if Congress approves legislation by Aug. 31 to yank highwayand other funding from cities and states that don't comply withclean-air standards. Congress has lifted its requirement thatcities meet those standards until the end of August.   According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 72 cities arenot meeting clean-air requirements and are benefiting from thecongressional reprieve.</TEXT></DOC>
