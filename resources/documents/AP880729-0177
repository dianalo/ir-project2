And a spokesman, Lt. Col. John Chapla, stressed that U.S.chemical weapons are designed not to become lethal until they reachthe battlefield.   The Army issued a detailed statement the day after AmbassadorMax Friedersdorf, chief U.S. delegate to the Conference onDisarmament in Geneva, listed five sites that the Americangovernment would declare as production facilities under a proposedinternational convention banning chemical weapons.   The talks, involving 40 nations, have been going on for 20 years.   The sites mentioned by Friedersdorf were: Rocky MountainArsenal, Colo.; Pine Bluff Arsenal, Ark.; Muscle Shoals, Ala.;Newport Army Ammunition Depot, Ind., and Aberdeen Proving Ground,Md.   In a related development, a Senate panel that has beeninvestigating the Army's chemical weapons program gave it highmarks for safety.   ``At the most critical point, where workers are in closeproximity to the agent, the chemical safety program is thestrongest. The workers at chemical storage areas are confident thatthey work in a safe environment,'' said the report, which waswritten by the Army's inspector general and released by the SenateGovernmental Affairs oversight subcommittee.   The Army resumed producing chemical weapons last December afterstopping in 1969. Spokesmen say the current so-called binaryweapons pose fewer storage and handling dangers than earlierunitary weapons because they consist of two separate chemicalswhich are brought together in an artillery shell just before firing.   ``The binary program is such that you never have a completeweapon stored in any one place. The two chemicals are never kepttogether and they will not be mated until just before firing,''said Chapla, the spokesman.   Should a chemical weapons treaty be signed, said Chapla, allfive sites mentioned in Geneva would be subject to whateverprovisions it may contain regarding the inspection or dismantlingof facilities.   ``The context of Ambassador Friedersdorf's statement is that ateach of the locations he identified, facilities exist which are, orwere at one time involved in the production of chemical weapons,''the statement said.   ``While all five of the facilities mentioned had some historicalconnection with production of unitary chemical weapons (using onerather than two chemicals), the U.S. has not been involved in theproduction of unitary chemical weapons since 1969,'' the statementsaid.   ``No chemical weapons production of any kind is going on atRocky Mountain Arsenal or Newport Army Ammunition plant,'' it said.   ``The Army facilities at Pine Bluff, Arkansas, are involved inthe production of a non-lethal component for the binary weaponssystem.''   ``No chemical weapons are being produced at Aberdeen provingground. Aberdeen was formerly connected with the production ofunitary chemical weapons prior to 1969.''   ``No chemical weapons are being produced at Muscle Shoals,'' thestatement said. ``At present, the Muscle Shoals facility isinvolved in a pilot plant project which will be used to prove outthe production process for one of the'' two chemicals involved itthe final weapon.   Spending for biological and chemical research has increasedsharply since President Reagan took office in 1981. In fiscal 1980,the total research was $63.5 million, compared with $348 millionfigure in fiscal 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
