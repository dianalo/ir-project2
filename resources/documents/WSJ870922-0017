Color Systems, Marina del Rey, Calif., which converts black-and-white films into color, said it establishes new copyrights on color-converted versions of &quot;public-domain&quot; films -- movies for which copyrights haven't been renewed and fees aren't owed original owners. Movies covered under the agreement with Trafalgar are public-domain films.    Trafalgar, Los Angeles, a closely held investment company, also acquired rights to use the Color Systems color-conversion technology in certain foreign markets. It said it intends to establish colorization studios in Europe and the Far East.    The agreement doesn't cover royalty revenue or certain other considerations.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Color Systems closed at $9 a share, up 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
