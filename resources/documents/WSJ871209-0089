Alan Cranston once wrote a book explaining the strategy that some Republican senators devised in 1919 to kill the treaty calling for the U.S. to join the League of Nations.    &quot;They would introduce amendment after amendment, and reservation after reservation,&quot; the California Democrat wrote. &quot;Eventually, the Senate and the people would become divided and disgusted, and full of doubts and fears. Then the League of Nations would be defeated.&quot;    Today, Sen. Cranston fears that history could repeat itself when the Senate debates the treaty signed yesterday by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons. The pact probably has enough support to win the two-thirds Senate vote necessary for ratification, but a small group of Republicans will attempt to attach amendments or reservations toughening it.    Such changes could send the treaty back to the negotiating table and, many experts believe, could thereby kill it. So this death-by-glancing-blows scenario is emerging as the darkest fear of the treaty's supporters. &quot;I don't think the problem is direct opposition,&quot; Sen. Cranston says. &quot;But I'm very concerned about individuals taking it on indirectly who are reluctant to oppose the president directly.&quot;    To overcome these hurdles to ratification, President Reagan will combine forces with Senate Democrats, normally some of his most strident enemies. Already, administration aides have met with some Democrats to discuss strategy. And Mr. Reagan will be speaking out loud and often. He began yesterday with nationally televised remarks after the treaty was signed, and will continue when he gives a speech to the nation tomorrow night after the close of the summit.    &quot;I for the United States and the general secretary for the Soviet Union have signed the first agreement ever to eliminate an entire class of U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons,&quot; Mr. Reagan said yesterday. &quot;We have made history.&quot;    Failure to ratify the treaty as it stands could destroy President Reagan's most cherished foreign-policy achievement. Even if the treaty survived intact, a messy ratification battle would seriously damage the prestige of Mr. Gorbachev, who has made what the Soviets consider huge concessions to the U.S.    The treaty would eliminate 859 American and 1,752 Soviet intermediate and short-range missiles. All told, these missiles represent only about 4% of the superpowers' nuclear weapons, but if such a limited treaty signed by a conservative Republican president failed to win approval, the Soviets might assume that no American president would be strong enough to get a treaty ratified. &quot;If we can't get this treaty, negotiated by President Reagan, ratified, then I think we have reason to wonder whether there's a future for arms control at all,&quot; says Sen. Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.    A ratification wrangle would certainly slow down talks on President Reagan's far more ambitious goal of negotiating a 50% cut in strategic arms. In fact, senators who don't want such a sweeping accord or who fear that President Reagan will deal away his plans for a &quot;Star Wars&quot; missile defense may try to drag out the ratification debate precisely because they want to stop a strategic-arms treaty.    One large question involves the pending treaty's radically new approach to verification. It would permit some inspections by Soviet and American officials at each other's military installations.    But will that be enough to satisfy those senators who doubt that it is possible to stop Soviet cheating on any treaty? &quot;If you can't get over the verification hurdle this time, it's going to be much more serious next time,&quot; says Thomas Griscom, the White House's communications director.    The administration will carry into the debate one big asset: the popularity of arms control. White House polls indicate that 80% of the general public and 70% of Republicans support the treaty, officials say. &quot;For better or for worse, there is a tremendous hunger out there for an arms-control agreement,&quot; says Sen. John McCain, Republican of Arizona.    It may be because of this hunger that the administration appears to have the numbers on its side in the Senate. The chamber's consideration of the treaty is scheduled to begin with hearings by Sen. Pell's committee starting Jan. 19 and culminate in a floor debate in March. If all 100 senators voted, it would take 34 senators to defeat the pact. Sen. Cranston, the Democrats' chief vote counter, estimates that there are 10 to 12 &quot;die-hard&quot; opponents and perhaps an additional 10 senators &quot;likely&quot; to oppose it, virtually all Republicans.    Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, the most influential Democrat on defense matters, is withholding judgment. He worries that the pact isn't part of a broader &quot;conceptual framework&quot; for defending the Western alliance. He also asserts that because the Reagan administration has tried to change the interpretation of the previously ratified Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, he will insist on seeing the voluminous negotiating record on the new pact so that there isn't any uncertainty later about its meaning. But in the end, most senators believe, only a few Democrats, such as Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina and Richard Shelby of Alabama, may vote no.    Thus, even the most hawkish senators doubt that the treaty can be killed outright. &quot;I'd be surprised if there would be enough to stop the treaty from being ratified,&quot; says Sen. Steve Symms, an Idaho Republican who, along with North Carolina Republican Jesse Helms, is likely to be one of the most vocal opponents of the pact.    The key question, however, may be not whether the treaty is ultimately ratified but whether the Senate attaches along the way &quot;killer amendments&quot; that substantially alter its text. Although it takes a two-thirds vote to ratify a treaty, changes made prior to ratification require only a simple majority. Senators could pass formal amendments, which would force changes in the treaty text, or reservations, which would declare that the treaty isn't binding unless the Soviets accept certain conditions.    For example, critics might propose an amendment that required more on-site inspections. Or they might offer a reservation declaring that the treaty would not become effective unless the Soviets corrected alleged violations of past treaties or improved human-rights practices. &quot;It's up to the Senate to put in those reservations&quot; linking the pact to human rights, declares Rep. Jack Kemp, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.    Moscow would have to agree to such changes before the treaty could be implemented. Changes thus could imperil the pact by reopening negotiations and allowing the Soviets to raise new questions of their own. But if senators wanted to express concern without formally altering the treaty, they might attach nonbinding &quot;understandings&quot; that, say, called on the president to put missiles back in place if the Soviets were found to be violating the treaty's terms.    Verification remains the area most likely to generate trouble, despite the pact's precedent-setting provisions to prevent Soviet cheating. Unlike the case in previous agreements, the U.S. won't have to rely only on spy satellites and secret electronic listening devices to ensure that the Soviets are following the new treaty; it will be able to conduct limited on-site inspections in the Soviet Union.    U.S. officials will be allowed a series of initial checks of Soviet intermediate-range missile sites, then follow-up inspections three years later in an effort to ensure that missiles have been destroyed. In the interim, U.S. officials will be allowed 20 short-notice inspections annually at any of 128 missile sites and production facilities in the Soviet bloc. After the interim period, the U.S. will get 15 such inspections a year for the next five years, then 10 annually for another five years. And an American team will be based permanently at a Soviet missile plant to confirm that banned missiles aren't being manufactured there. The Soviets get similar rights.    Still, critics will argue that the mobility of the Soviets' SS-20 missiles, the most important ones being eliminated, makes the treaty almost impossible to verify. Because the SS-20 can be moved along highways in special trucks, critics maintain, the U.S. can't know from satellite photos just how many there are now. It is depending partly on data that the Soviets themselves have provided.    In any case, critics say, secret missiles could be kept hidden in garages or under camouflage, to be brought out at a moment's notice. The problem in spotting and keeping track of SS-20s was underscored recently when senior officials took President Reagan a large copy of the best overhead photo American satellites have been able to take of an SS-20 in the field. &quot;I can't see it,&quot; complained Mr. Reagan, looking at a picture that seemed to contain only a large group of trees. Officials then pointed out a small mark in the enlarged photo that experts had identified as an SS-20 deployed amid the trees.    Treaty critics will probably push for even more on-site inspections -- and argue that the U.S. should be allowed to make surprise inspections at any site it chooses in the Soviet Union, rather than only 128 sites on a list prearranged with the Soviets. Some critics contend that the Soviets may have more sites than the 128.    &quot;The last place the Soviets would choose to hide missiles is in one of the places we have the right to inspect,&quot; says Richard Perle, a former assistant defense secretary who is reserving judgment on the pact until he sees its details. (The White House didn't release the text of the new treaty until after it was signed yesterday, and it hasn't yet released a &quot;memorandum of understanding&quot; that includes information on missile numbers, locations and capabilities.)    Moreover, Sen. Helms has questioned whether the treaty should be enacted before a new spy satellite, whose launching has been delayed by the January 1986 space-shuttle disaster, is in place to help in verification.    In response, administration aides argue that the Soviets have little incentive to keep a few missiles in hiding. Because the Soviets couldn't test the missiles without revealing their existence, they wouldn't be very reliable after a few years, officials argue. Besides, the Soviets have longer-range missiles unaffected by the treaty that could be used to cover the same targets as the SS-20. And, officials contend, missiles kept in hiding don't help the Soviets intimidate Western Europe, one of the main uses of their nuclear arms.    No matter how airtight the verification, some senators may try to attach provisions spelling out tough steps the U.S. and its allies would take if the Soviets were caught cheating. &quot;The problem with verification to me is that, absent some European commitment to respond if there is a violation, it doesn't do you a hell of a lot of good to verify,&quot; asserts Sen. Malcolm Wallop, a Wyoming Republican who is a leading skeptic about arms control.    Another question is whether the U.S. should ratify the new treaty before it has reached agreement with the Soviets on cuts in the more important area of strategic arms. By agreeing to eliminate intermediate-range missiles in Europe, critics say, the U.S. will appear to be backing away from its nuclear defense of Western Europe -- an impression the Soviets want to foster -- without winning cuts in the Soviets' big land-based strategic missiles that most worry the U.S.    &quot;It's foolhardy to ratify one piece of it,&quot; says Eugene Rostow, former director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and a leader of an influential group of hawks called the Committee on the Present Danger. &quot;It's an incentive for the Soviets to stall. . . . The best strategy {for the U.S.} is to wait.&quot;    Senators wary of the treaty are also expected to seek a delay in its implementation until the administration negotiates cuts that reduce the Soviets' big superiority in nonnuclear forces in Europe. Without such an agreement, critics will argue, elimination of intermediate-range nuclear forces will make Western Europe more vulnerable to a conventional Soviet attack.    Beyond these areas, some senators may try to attach amendments demanding that the Soviets rectify alleged violations of past arms agreements, perhaps by dismantling a big radar installation at Krasnoyarsk that many experts consider a violation of the 1972 ABM treaty.    Proponents fear that some amendments along these lines will be hard for even treaty backers to oppose, so they will try to steer the Senate away from formal amendments and into nonbinding understandings. &quot;What we have to do is come up with alternatives that recognize the problem {of legitimate concerns} but express it without killing the treaty,&quot; says Sen. Cranston. &quot;The first thing is to prevent it from going back to the negotiating table.&quot;    ---            How the Treaty Affects the Superpowers                               UNITED STATES   SOVIET UNION    What will be eliminated    Deployed Missiles      Intermediate Range        (600-3,400 miles)                429            470      Short Range (300-600 miles)          0            387    Non-deployed Missiles      Intermediate Range                 260            356      Short Range                        170            539    TOTAL                                859          1,752    Verification provisions    -- Initial inspections 60 days after the treaty entersinto force.    -- Close-out inspections after three years to ensure thatthe missiles have been destroyed.    -- 20 short-notice inspections in the first three years.    -- 15 short-notice inspections in the next five years.    -- 10 short-notice inspections in the following fiveyears.    -- U.S. inspectors to be based at a Soviet militaryfactory in Votkinsk for 13 years.    -- Soviet inspectors to be based at a U.S. militaryfactory in Utah for 13 years.
