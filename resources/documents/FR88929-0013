Thisamendment provides additional instructions for one of the inspections listedin the previous AD, clarifies the area to be inspected, and changes therepetitive inspection intervals for that inspection. This action is promptedby reports of corrosion and/or wear in the horizontal stabilizer-to-fuselageattachment fittings, bushings, and pins. This condition, if not corrected,could compromise the strength of the horizontal stabilizer fuselage assembly.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>effective date: </T2>November 3, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>addresses: </T2>The applicable service information may be obtainedfrom Short Brothers PLC, 2011 Crystal Drive, Suite 713, Arlington, Virginia22202-3702.

Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate inthe making of this amendment. No comments were received in response to the proposal. After careful review of the available data, the FAA has determined thatair safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule asproposed. It is estimated that 58 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected bythis AD, that it will take approximately 10 manhours per airplane to accomplishthe required actions, and that the average labor cost will be $40 per manhour.Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operatorsis estimated to be $23,200. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule will not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, the FAA has determined that this regulationis not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291 or significantunder DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979); and it is further certified under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act that this rule will not have a significant economic impact,positive or negative, effect on a substantial number of small entities,because of the minimal cost per airplane ($400). A final evaluation hasbeen prepared for this regulation and has been placed in the docket. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects_14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection; 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
