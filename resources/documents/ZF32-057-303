 Although all the major E-mail productsoffer cross-platform communication, WordPerfect Office is the firstgroup-scheduling product to do so.andM;Partitioned office.andP;  WordPerfect's package consists of a suite of deskaccessories that includes a simple flat-file database and a disk utility anddrawing DA, in addition to E-mail and scheduling.andP;  The Mail and Calendar DAsare the groupware components, while Notebook and File Manager are purelylocal tools.andP;  Forms Maker is the drawing tool for creating forms to be usedwith the other components.andM;While Notebook and File Manager are interesting, they offer little that isn'tavailable in superior products, and the decision to include them in thisself-proclaimed &quot;Office Automation Software&quot; package strikes us as somewhatstrange.andP;  Notebook, for example, has no provision for importing informationfrom other formats (aside from DOS versions of Notebook).andP;  File Manageroffers only a pale subset of the features available from more-competentproducts.andP;  Nevertheless, the WordPerfect Office package does offer the busymanager the advantage of single-source purchase and WordPerfect support.andO;Given that WordPerfect Office is priced competitively with E-mail-onlyproducts, you could consider these extras as free.andM;Mail call.andP;  WordPerfect Mail breaks little new ground; its feature setoverlaps substantially ith Administration of Mac and PC connections is morecomplex than running a Mac-only setup, but the Mac side of things fits intothe standard E-mail mode.andP;  The WordPerfect mail server, which acts as thescheduling server as well, can run in the background on a Mac and iscontrolled through the WP Office Administrator application.andP;  While you canadministrate from anywhere on the AppleTalk network, you cannot perform anyadministrative tasks while users are logged in -- a real inconvenience.andP;  Theadministrative application is modeled closely on AppleShare's, with someadditions for mail-specific features.andM;Users and groups are defined on a server-by-server basis.andP;  Groups defined bythe administrator are available to all users, and individuals can definetheir own.andP;  Although WordPerfect Office servers on the same network cancommunicate with each other to exchange mail, schedules and user listsautomatically, they don't do so by default.andP;  Setting up a smoothlyfunctioning system of mail servers that seamlessly communicate with andupdate each other is harder with WordPerfect Office than with Microsoft Mail,but easier than with QuickMail.andM;The user's Mail window is aesthetically designed and always lists themessages sent, a feature we appreciated in daily use.andP;  An Info dialog boxholds extensive status information about any incoming or outgoing message,including sender name, form used, subject, date and time, type, number ofenclosures, sender's server, recipient's name, and whether the recipient hasopened or deleted it.andP;  Having a single place to look for all this data ishandy.andM;Three standard forms are provided, along with the capability to create newones.andP;  The memo form is unremarkable, and the phone form duplicates thecommon printed message pad.andP;  The graphics form lets you display an image(pasted from the Clipboard) directly in the form.andP;  In many instances, this ismuch more convenient than the alternative of enclosing a file.andP;  WordPerfectMail does not allow you to enclose the Clipboard with a message, a featurethat almost all its competitors offer.andP;  But with this form there's littleneed for it.andM;Users with less-than-perfect spelling or typing skills will like Mail'sspelling checker.andP;  The provided dictionary consists of 80,000 words, and Mailalso can use WordPerfect 2.0's 125,000-word dictionary.andM;WordPerfect Mail's major limitation is its lack of direct support forgateways to external E-mail services, such as CompuServe, MCI Mail andsystems using Message Handling Service (MHS).andP;  Users who need suchconnections will have to rely on the capabilities of WordPerfect Office forDOS.andP;  Connections to outside E-mail services are often vital, so we can'trecommend Mail for sites that don't have a DOS WordPerfect Office network.andO;For offices that are equipped with the DOS version of the product, severalgateways are available, and each is sold separately.andM;Unfortunately, according to WordPerfect, none of the pieces that would allowtraveling or remote users to dial into the network to send mail is ready;every other Mac E-mail package has this capability.andM;Take a meeting.andP;  Meeting and resource scheduling is a time-consuming, complextask for which networked computers are well-suited, as demonstrated by ONTechnology Inc.'s Meeting Maker (see MacWEEK, May 14), the first productoffering this functionality on the Mac.andP;  WordPerfect Office's Calendar DAoffers similar capabilities.andM;Calendar is well-integrated with Mail, beginning with the shared Log Indialog box.andP;  Other common features include zone selection; user and groupselection; and the Info feature, which provides a report on a specificscheduling request, including a list of the users who have received therequest and the server to which they are attached.andP;  However, you can useCalendar on its own if you prefer, as you can with all of WordPerfectOffice's pieces.andM;Resources, such as conference rooms or multimedia equipment, are assigned bythe administrator  to the custody of an individual user.andP;  In practice thismethod can be unwieldy.andP;  If, for example, you are designated as the userresponsible for Conference Room A, you must log out of your personalcalender, and then log in as the room so you can respond to any requests foruse of the room.andM;Most calendar functions are easy to access.andP;  To see what time periods areavailable  for a meeting, you only have to open the Busy at a Glance window.andO;Some features, however, are a little more complex.andP;  The Auto-Date andAuto-Event functions are in this category.andP;  You have a great deal offlexibility in scheduling a meeting, say, the third Tuesday of each monthduring the fourth quarter, but you access this by typing formulas inWordPerfect's scheduling language.andM;Calendar lacks a proxy feature, whereby one user is granted permission tomanage the schedule of another.andP;  Executives accustomed to depending onsupport staff for such mundane chores may not take kindly to this omission.andM;In addition to managing meeting and resource requests among workgroups,Calendar functions as a personal time manager for each local user.andP;  It can beused for appointment scheduling, personal memos and for managing prioritizedto-do lists.andP;  Happily, the scheduling data is stored locally, so you canstill plan your future if the network goes down or if you use a portable bothon the network and away from it.andP;  This is a clear advantage over MeetingMaker and Microsoft's Scheduleandplus; (see MacWEEK, Aug.andP;  13).andM;Support system.andP;  Historically WordPerfect Corp. has compensated for anydeficiencies in its products by providing very good support, and we have noreason to expect that the company will abandon this policy with WordPerfectOffice.andM;The product documentation is of high quality and, with only a couple ofexceptions, well-written.andP;  Each WordPerfect Office DA is introduced by abrief tutorial followed by an inclusive command reference.andM;In most cases, motivated users will be able to train themselves and thus makeminimal demands on departmental support resources.andP;  WordPerfect Office doesnot support balloon help or any other System 7.0 feature, but it does runfine in 24-bit-addressing mode.andM;Conclusions.andP;  Inter- and intra-office E-mail is well-established as acritical productivity tool, and group scheduling could easily assume asimilarly important role on Mac networks now that the product category isfilling out.andP;  The most notable feature of WordPerfect's contribution to thisarea is that WordPerfect Office 3.01 lets Mac users exchange their mail andschedules with DOS users on non-AppleTalk LANs.andP;  WordPerfect has promisedsimilar compatibility with VMS, Unix and Windows versions of WordPerfectOffice when they are released.andM;It's difficult to overestimate the importance of cross-platform compatibilityfor group communication.andP;  WordPerfect has filled this need nicely for Mac andDOS environments.andP;  If you haven't yet decided on an E-mail package for yoursite, WordPerfect Office's Mail is competitive with the rest of the field,and it offers the only compatible solution to group scheduling.andP;  Mixed sitesalready running the DOS version of WordPerfect Office will want to bring theMacs on-line immediately.andM;WordPerfect Corp. is at 1555 N. Technology Way, Orem, Utah 84057.andP;  Phone(801) 225-5000; fax (801) 228-5077.andM;WordPerfect Office for the MacintoshandM;WordPerfect Corp.andM;WordPerfect Office 3.01 consists primarily of DAs for E-mail and workgroupscheduling (flat-file database, disk-management and forms-creation DAs arethrown in, too).andP;  The product is worthy competition for existing E-mailpackages.andP;  It's trump card is that scheduling and mail can be shared with IBMPCs and compatibles running the DOS version of WordPerfect Office onnon-AppleTalk networks.andP;  Managers of sites with mixed Mac and DOS platformswill find it particularly appealing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
