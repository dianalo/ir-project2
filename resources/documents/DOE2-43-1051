Irradiation was conducted to cyclicly increasecolonic temperature from 38.5 to 39.5/sup 0/C. Colonic, tympanic, andsubcutaneous temperatures, ECG, blood pressure, and respiratory ratewere continuously recorded during experimentation. At both power densities,the subcutaneous and tympanic temperature increases significantly exceededthe colonic temperature increase. At both exposure levels, heart rateincreased significantly during irradiation and returned to baseline whenexposure was discontinued. Blood pressure and respiratory rate did notsignificantly change during irradiation. There were no significant differencesbetween the effects of CW and pulsed RFR exposure. The levels of subcutaneousheating and heart rate change were greater, and the times required toachieve and to recover from a 1/sup 0/C colonic temperature increasewere longer than in previous studies conducted at 2.8 GHz. Results ofthese studies indicate that the carrier frequency used during irradiationmarkedly affects the pattern of heat distribution and the physiologicalresponses of RF-irradiated animals.</TEXT></DOC>
