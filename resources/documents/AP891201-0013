Gorbachev said in a messagedelivered today that Lithuanian communists risk damaging his reformmovement if they persist in their fight for independence, aLithuanian journalist and political activist said.   Eduardas Potashinskas said the Communist Party ideology chiefread the statement during a meeting of the Lithuanian CommunistParty Central Committee on the Baltic republic's drive forindependence.   Lithuanian leader Algirdas Brazauskas rebuffed the ideologychief, Vadim A. Medvedev, as he read the appeal, said Potashinskas,a Lithuanian TV editor and a member of the Sajudis politicalmovement.   Medvedev told Lithuanian communists, ``Any movement towardsecession will deal a most severe blow to perestroika, and it willcome at its hardest period, its turning point.''   He quoted Brazauskas as responding, ``Lithuania withoutsovereignty is Lithuania without a future.''   Rimintas Kanapenas, Sajudis' spokesman, said most LithuanianCentral Committee members supported Brazauskas.   About 2,000 protesters gathered outside the Central Committeebuilding in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, and some stayed allday, Kanapenas said.   The meeting was being broadcast on radio and was taped for laterpresentation on television.   Gorbachev and the Moscow party leadership summoned Brazauskasand the Lithuanian party leaders to the Kremlin two weeks ago todiscuss Lithuania's plans to split its Communist Party from thenational party. That move could be taken at a congress of theLithuanian party beginning Dec. 19.   Gorbachev, who was visiting the Vatican today, has spoken outagainst such a move several times, and he emphasized the point inthe message Medvedev delivered today.   ``It must not be allowed. It is inadmissible now to follow theway of splitting communists on the basis of national or socialbackground. This contradicts the very essence of internationalistsocialism. This would contradict the interests of the people,'' themessage said.   Such a move would ``question the issue of the popular foundationof the postwar European home that has been born out with suchdifficulty, which is not firm enough yet and even fragile in someways, peaceful, but living through a difficult transformationnow,'' the TV editor quoted the statement as saying.   The three Baltic republics, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia wereabsorbed into the Soviet Union by Josef Stalin in 1940 under asecret agreement with Adolf Hitler's Germany. They had beenindependent since the fall of the czarist empire.   On Monday, they won approval from the national parliament forbroad economic independence beginning Jan. 1. Baltic leaders saythe plan allows them to get a share of the earnings of factoriesrun by Moscow-based ministries and to print their own money forinternal use.   Thirty-nine Communists in neighboring Latvia, including eightmembers of the local party's Central Committee, also have calledfor an independent party, the Tass news agency said Thursday.   In Estonia, the local party's ideology chief, Mikk Titma, saidin an interview with his party's daily that he is certain the legalguarantee of the party's leading role in political life will beeliminated from Estonia's constitution.</TEXT></DOC>
