WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, one of the potentialleaders of the Republican right wing, delivered a blisteringdeclaration to party delegates that Michael Dukakis would ``wimpAmerica and endanger peace.''   The senator from Bush's adopted home state praised George Bushas ``the greatest vice president this nation has ever had'' as heplaced Bush's name in nomination Wednesday before the conventionroll call.   But Gramm, a Democrat-turned-Republican widely assumed to havepresidential aspirations, turned the focus back on the Democraticnominee on a night that was otherwise devoted to Bush.   ``He taxed the poor, taxed the rich, taxed the young, taxed theold and taxed the middle class,'' Gramm said of Dukakis. ``He taxedbusinesses, and he taxed families.''   He said Dukakis broke his promise to voters in his first term asgovernor of Massachusetts by raising taxes, and in his second termincreased state spending and brought on Massachusetts' $400 milliondeficit. He said Dukakis has opposed ``every major new weaponssystem that we have deployed.''   Gramm elicited loud shouts of ``no'' from the delegates as heasked:   ``Given his record, is there anybody here who doubts that aPresident Dukakis would raise our taxes?   ``Is there anybody here who doubts that a President Dukakiswould spend our workers into poverty?   ``Is there anybody here who doubts that a President Dukakiswould cut defense, wimp America and endanger peace?''   Gramm's selection to deliver Bush's nominating speech added atouch of Texas to the Republican convention as a counterpoint tothe heavy Texas influence of the Democratic convention in Atlantalast month. It was the Texas delegation's vote _ by arrangement _that gave Bush the delegate majority and the presidentialnomination during the roll call.   In Atlanta, the podium was filled with Texans in the Democrats'calculated effort to win that major electoral state in the fall _ aplan capped by the selection of Gramm's senior colleague in theSenate, Lloyd Bentsen, as the Democratic vice presidential nominee.   Gramm, best known nationally for the Gramm-Rudmandeficit-reduction law, became a Republican only five years ago. Hebolted the Democratic Party as a congressman, rejecting it as notconservative enough, and won election to the Senate in his newparty.   He was disqualified by the U.S. Constitution from joining theticket as Bush's running mate by their shared Texas home. As afavorite of many in the GOP's most conservative wing, Gramm isconsidered a likely presidential candidate in 1982, should Bushfalter _ although Bush's elevation of running mate Dan Quayle tothe upper reaches of party leadership may displace him.   The nominating speech, delivering Gramm a prime-time televisionaudience and his most visible party platform, triggered a planned,flag-waving demonstration on the floor of the massive Superdomeconvention hall as 50,000 bright balloons fell from the highceiling.</TEXT></DOC>
