A fraudulent conveyance suit typically alleges that theprevious owners of a company acquired in a leveraged buy-outcommitted fraud by transferring their assets in a sale, eventhough the company was insolvent or was rendered insolvent bythe transaction.</LP><TEXT>   Campeau said such a suit would be based on Allied'spurchase of shares in Federated Department Stores Inc.,another Campeau unit, in May 1988 and April 1989. Thepurchases gave Allied a 50% stake in Federated.   Allied and Federated filed for protection from creditorsunder Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in January.   Campeau said it could be liable to repay as much as $250million if such a suit were successful. The company didn'tindicate whether it expects a suit to be filed. Theinformation was contained in a circular distributed byCampeau ahead of its annual meeting, scheduled for July 30.   Representatives of the Allied creditors couldn't bereached for comment.   Campeau purchased Allied in 1986 and Federated a yearlater in highly leveraged transactions with a combined pricetag of $10 billion. Allied used some of the proceeds from thesale of its Brooks Brothers and Ann Taylor divisions topurchase the Federated shares from a Campeau subsidiary,which in turn used the funds to pay off debt from theFederated acquisition.   David Heiman, a partner with the law firm of Jones, Day,Reavis andamp; Pogue of Cleveland, which represents the Ohio-basedCampeau subsidiaries, said the bankruptcy court approved anagreement between Allied and its bondholders that&quot;acknowledges we would not claim that they do not havestanding to bring such an action.&quot;   Mr. Heiman said the agreement requires the bondholders togive 30 days' notice of their intention to file a fraudulentconveyance suit. He said the parties also agreed not to takeany action at least until Sept. 12, 1990.   Separately, Campeau disclosed in its information circularthat its chairman and chief executive officer, RobertCampeau, missed a $1 million payment on a personal loan fromCampeau Corp. that was due April 30.   The company said it has requested that Mr. Campeau&quot;propose a plan of repayment&quot; and it &quot;intends to pursue theremedies available to it if necessary.&quot; It said Mr. Campeauhas $13 million in loans outstanding from the company,including $9 million lent to Mr. Campeau during the fiscalyear ended Jan. 31, 1990.
