Chipello (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> HFS </CO><IN> STK TNM BNK </IN><DATELINE> BURLINGTON, Mass.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   You don't mess with Albert H. Holgerson Jr., the Arnold Schwarzenegger of Boston banking. At 45 years of age, he bench-presses 400 pounds. He can break down a locked door with his beefy shoulder. He is capable, a former colleague says, of &quot;towering anger.&quot;    Not until last fall, however, when Peat Marwick Main auditors questioned the accounting methods proposed by his savings and loan association, did Mr. Holgerson's temper cause much trouble. He threatened to have an auditor arrested if he set foot on the premises of Home Owners Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, of which Mr. Holgerson is the chairman, chief executive officer and president.    That helped precipitate the Great Home Owners Bear Raid, a financial tug of war the likes of which Massachusetts' once-stodgy thrift industry has never before experienced.    World-class short sellers -- the Feschbach Brothers and James Chanos -- have joined the fray. These people have borrowed stock to sell for money, a practice that the bulls, who have borrowed money to buy stock, profess to find reprehensible. Among the bullish forces, the cast of characters includes a millionaire former seminarian (who once sued the Boy Scouts) and the road-paving king of New Hampshire, who was convicted of bid-rigging a few years ago and did time in jail.    For months now, Home Owners' stock price has yo-yoed as the bears and the bulls in turn have obtained the upper hand; it plunged as low as $10.25 from a high of $29.75 a share, then rallied and fell again. As of yesterday, the remaining short sellers were breathing easier; the stock was selling at $20. But both sides bear painful wounds. The former seminarian had to mortgage his yacht to meet margin calls when the bears tried to wipe him out by shorting other stocks he owned.    After that, the bulls got revenge. As the stock price rose, buyers demanded the delivery of certificates for their purchases, creating a shortage and reminding the short sellers of Wall Street's old ditty: &quot;He who sells what isn't his'n buys it back or goes to prison.&quot;    The bears had to buy stock back to cover their short sales, but a run-up in price eroded their gains or turned them into losses. The bulls, still hanging tough, will sell their stock only at high prices. &quot;If I'd known that these guys could execute such a beautiful squeeze,&quot; says a veteran short seller who is crying foul, &quot;I wouldn't have got into it.&quot;    &quot;Any time the shorts get squeezed, they squeal,&quot; retorts David Warnock, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, the mutualfund group, one of whose funds is a major Home Owners shareholder.    Financial institutions, whose existence depends in large part on public confidence, rarely get so brazenly disparaged as Home Owners has been by short sellers. They say the Sandamp;L is a house of cards build on accounting gimmickry, particularly on an obscure entry that accounts for some $325 million of Home Owners' total assets of $4 billion. This item is the estimated value of Home Owners' rights to continue servicing, for fees, the mortgage loans that it has sold to investors in the secondary mortgage market.    Dubious assumptions inflate the value of these rights, the shorts say, making Home Owners seem worth a lot more than it really is. The assets at issue are &quot;at best questionable and at worse hugely overstated,&quot; says Peter Homans, a principal of a small Boston brokerage house that has aggressively whipped up the shorts.    None of the other short sellers are willing to be quoted by name, but they are happy to knock Home Owners anonymously. Sample comments: &quot;The odds of regulators not looking at this company have got to be zero.&quot; &quot;This is a one-dollar stock.&quot; &quot;This company is going broke.&quot; &quot;Taxpayers are ultimately going to foot the bill.&quot;    Lies and smears, say Home Owners officials and bullish shareholders. They say the Sandamp;L faithfully follows accepted accounting principles. But they say Home Owners has attracted a lot of attention, including the scrutiny of short sellers, for being smarter and more aggressive than its tradition-bound rivals. &quot;If Home Owners were headquartered in San Diego or Los Angeles, it wouldn't get much attention. Out there we would be considered just another financial-services company,&quot; says Mark Temkin, the chief financial officer.    Before Mr. Holgerson arrived in 1978, Home Owners was anything but aggressive. It was founded in 1910 as Eureka Cooperative Bank, a mutual savings bank owned by its depositors, largely working people to whom it made mortgage loans. A decade ago it had just six offices in the Boston area and $200 million in assets.    Hired from a competitor, Mr. Holgerson took the bank on a nationwide expansion binge, acquiring mortgage bankers and Sandamp;Ls. It converted to a stock company and in May 1984 raised $7 million in fresh capital with the sale of stock to the public at a split-adjusted $2.96 a share. It now has 111 offices in 24 states.    Mr. Holgerson earned a reputation as a strong executive, in more ways than one. He installed a health club, with weights and barbells, at headquarters. He once rammed down the door of a locked-out executive's office. &quot;It was pretty much torn right out of the frame,&quot; marvels a former executive who saw the damage.    Mr. Holgerson can be demanding and volatile, others say. He once called Joseph Traxler, a former executive, a &quot;parasite&quot; and a &quot;cancer,&quot; according to a lawsuit Mr. Traxler has filed against a Home Owners subsidiary for allegedly breaching his employment contract. Fredrick W. Biel, a former executive vice president, says Mr. Holgerson occasionally knocked over furniture, slammed doors and once tried to throw a telephone out a third-floor window, but it was secured by a cord. Still, says Mr. Biel, he is &quot;an excellent person to work for.&quot; Admirers say he produces results; when rising interest rates racked mortgage lenders in early 1987, he introduced a convertible, adjustable-rate mortgage that generated a lot of new business and was widely copied.    For his part, Mr. Holgerson declines to discuss his style or his personal life. &quot;I'm a private person, I haven't run for public office,&quot; he says. As for tantrums, he says, &quot;One time I smashed a phone. In the last 10 years I got angry once.&quot;    But Mr. Holgerson got very upset last fall when Peat Marwick Main rejected the way Home Owners proposed to account for a certain transaction in its financial reports. Had Home Owners had its way, the transaction would have increased earnings; instead, they showed a sharp drop for the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 30. The dispute grew so heated that Home Owners threatened to have a Peat Marwick auditor arrested if he entered the thrift's property. Mr. Holgerson relented when Peat Marwick warned it would report Home Owners' threat as an attempt to restrict the audit. Still, he promptly fired Peat Marwick when the audit was completed.    Word of the dispute reached short sellers, who already were watching Home Owners, and Peat Marwick later recounted the story in a report to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. As of Oct. 15, only 63,011 of Home Owners' 5.9 million outstanding shares had been sold short. Two months later, the short interest was 760,211 shares and rising.    Among the short sellers were Kurt, Joe and Matthew Feshbach of Palo Alto, Calif., who manage about $200 million for limited partners and typically are short dozens of stocks at a time; and Mr. Chanos, of New York, a renowned short who runs investment firms such as Ursus (Latin for bear) Securities and Kynikos (Greek for cynical) Associates.    The stock had peaked in September. It endured Black Monday, Oct. 19, better than many, and by Nov. 24 it was selling for around $24 a share. On that day came an announcement that a group of investors was considering taking the company private. Instead of lifting the price, the news seemed to confirm that Home Owners needed help, and the price plunged by 45% to $13.25 in 10 days.    Leading the group of investors was David LaRoche, a Rhode Islander who held 9.9% of Home Owners' shares, the most allowed without federal approval. Mr. LaRoche, who had attended a seminary, made one fortune in real estate. In the 1970s, he made news by suing the Boy Scouts over a land deal, an action he now blames on an injudicious lawyer. &quot;I was an Eagle Scout myself and was kind of appalled,&quot; he says of the suit.    Mr. LaRoche later started putting his money in the stock of New England thrift institutions, making a name for himself by threatening takeovers and then selling his holdings at a profit to takeover partners more warmly welcomed by management. Mr. LaRoche never actually succeeded in taking anybody over.    Short sellers say he was never serious about acquiring Home Owners, either, and got desperate when the value of his holdings fell instead of rising. Investors in his group included his sister, Carolyn McElroy, to whom he had lent money to buy a 3.4% interest in Home Owners. Mr. LaRoche says, &quot;I've always helped my family,&quot; and he insists that he was serious about a Home Owners takeover.    He concedes, however, that the bear raid caused big problems. He had bought his stock with borrowed money, on margin, and he began getting margin calls when the price fell. It wasn't easy to raise cash to meet the margin calls, he says, because the short sellers, aware of his other shareholdings, began to sell those stocks, too.    That forced him to sell shares in a falling market, sell waterfront property and mortgage his 60-foot yacht, all to meet margin calls of more than $5 million. &quot;Short selling is one dirty business,&quot; he says. &quot;These people really rape the system.&quot;    In early January, Mr. LaRoche backed off. He announced that his group no longer intended to acquire control of Home Owners and take it private. &quot;We thought it was all over for LaRoche,&quot; a short seller says.    Thanks to the deep pockets of Milo L. Pike, it wasn't. Although Mr. Pike isn't in the LaRoche investor group, he got interested in Home Owners after talking with Mr. LaRoche and supported taking it private. Mr. Pike, the shorts gleefully point out to anyone who will listen, last made the news in 1984, when he was convicted in New Hampshire of rigging bids on roadwork contracts. He spent 25 days in jail, and he and his company later paid $2.5 million to settle a civil suit arising from the case. &quot;Don't misunderstand me, I was guilty. But to come out and use that&quot; -- in the Home Owners battle -- &quot;isn't right,&quot; Mr. Pike complains.    Mr. Pike, who recently sold his paving company for $77 million, bought Home Owners stock almost daily from early November to March. &quot;Apres ski,&quot; he even placed buy orders with his stockbroker from Europe, where he spends several months on the slopes every winter. (His wife is Penny Pitou, who won two silver medals in skiing in the 1960 Olympics and now runs a travel business.) Mr. Pike bought 9.9% in Home Owners, too.    Mr. Pike's heavy buying failed to sway the shorts -- at first, anyway. The short interest in Home Owners stock topped one million shares in mid-February and swelled to 1.3 million shares, or 22% of the total outstanding, on March 15. The stock price hit a first-quarter low of $11.25 in mid-February.    As the battle was joined, both sides fired public-relations volleys. John McRae, a securities analyst for Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., Home Owners' investment banker, issued a bullish report on the company in late February. Homans, McGraw, Trull, Valeo andamp; Co., a Boston brokerage house that has recommended shorting the stock, responded with a bearish report.    The shorts also took a poke at Mr. McRae. Mr. Homans pointed out that Mr. McRae had written reports touting the prospects of Wedtech Corp. -- before four officials of the defense contractor pleaded guilty to inflating the company's earnings through fraudulent accounting. Mr. McRae replies that his Wedtech reports are &quot;really irrelevant&quot; to his analysis of Home Owners. The shorts, he adds, &quot;stoop to almost anything.&quot;    The short squeeze began three months ago. Mr. Pike and others began shrinking the supply of lendable stock by demanding delivery of the certificates for their shares, which brokers had been lending out to short sellers. When the shorts scrambled to buy shares, the price rose to $18.25 a share in mid-April from $13 or so a share in mid-March. Shorts who couldn't find shares to buy back have been particularly hard-pressed. &quot;What's going on is a lot of wigggling, dancing, fast talk and lies,&quot; says one. &quot;It's something like 'your check is in the mail.'&quot; In some cases, short sellers were &quot;bought in&quot; -- that is, their brokers bought shares for them at higher prices than those at which the sellers had sold their borrowed shares.    The shorts who are standing firm say there's no real demand for Home Owners stock now, except from the shorts themselves, when they buy to cover their positions. Eventually, they say, Home Owners' suspect accounting will zap the stock price. As the stock dropped recently, Mr. LaRoche again proposed to buy some of Home Owners' assets. Shorts say his proposal is another attempt to prop up the price. &quot;It's the basic train running down the track doing 150 miles per hour,&quot; one of the shorts says. &quot;But a quarter of a mile up the road, there's no more track.&quot;    (See: &quot;Corrections andamp; Amplifications: Home Owners Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association&quot; -- WSJ June 17, 1988)   ---           Home Owners Federal Sandamp;L Short Interest                           NUMBER OF                              SHARES              STOCK DATE                     SOLD SHORT              PRICE 5/13/88                     975,234             $14.75 - 4/15/88                   1,193,952              16.25 3/15/88                   1,307,650              13.25 2/12/88                   1,054,705              11.25 1/15/88                     995,217              14.00 12/15/87                    760,211              14.50 11/13/87                    153,338              20.00 10/15/87                     63,011              26.25 9/15/87                      14,398              27.50</TEXT></DOC>
