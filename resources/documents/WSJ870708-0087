The Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. amended the year-old program, which was originally available only to farm and energy lenders, to cover all banks. The regulators also extended the deadline for applying for the waiver by two years to Dec. 31, 1989. Banks with problem real estate loans, for example, could now obtain a waiver.    To be eligible for the program, known as forbearance, an institution must show that its problems are due to economic conditions and not mismanagement, and must have a plan to restore the bank's capital to the required level by Jan. 1, 1995. Currently, banks are required to maintain capital equal to 6% of their assets.    The Comptroller and the FDIC instituted the policy early last year to give well-run banks beset by economic troubles time to work out their problems. About 160 institutions have applied to enter the program. </TEXT></DOC>
