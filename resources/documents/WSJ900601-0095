The ambitious plan, to be completed by 1995, will morethan double the 91-year-old company's investment in plant andequipment. But it's unclear whether the program will reapdividends or help Timken surge ahead of the five largerJapanese, Swedish and West German competitors.</LP><TEXT>   Indeed, Timken's most recent big capital project --construction of a nearly $500 million specialty steel mill --has yet to pay off. The mill contributed to Timken's sizablelosses from steel operations in 1985 and 1986 and has yet toearn a satisfactory profit.   Most of the $1 billion of planned capital investment isgoing to build &quot;21st Century&quot; bearings factories that cancompete throughout the world, as well as modernize existingfacilities. &quot;The bearings business has to be seen as a globalindustry,&quot; says Peter J. Ashton, executive vice president,bearings. More than a quarter of Timken's own sales last yearwere made outside the U.S., thanks to plants in Australia,Brazil, France, Britain and South Africa.   Timken chose the massive $1 billion investment over a moremodest and slower upgrade of plants to produce sharpimprovements in productivity and quality. That difference maydetermine whether Timken is a leader or a marginallyprofitable also-ran in the world bearings industry. Timkenspent a total of just $180 million on its bearings plantsfrom 1983 to 1988. The company has been holding its own sofar, industry analysts say, but competition from largercompetitors is intensifying.   The current investment plan assumes that the 1990s will bekinder to cyclical smokestack companies than the past decade.The 1980s began with back-to-back recessions, followed byfour years of the overvalued dollar. Timken's most recentgood earnings came in 1981 when the company earned $4.50 ashare. In 1989, which included a lengthy fourth-quarterstrike the company earned $55.3 million, or $1.88 a share.Company officials said 1990 earnings will be higher butwouldn't be specific.   Timken executives were reminded this past week thatthere's a risk in concentrating exclusively on long-termgrowth. The stock spurted briefly in active trading followinga televised report that Timken was a takeover target of BTRPLC, a big British concern. Timken officials refused tocomment on the report, and the stock activity died down.   Some economists think the 1990s will be more favorable tocapital goods suppliers as the U.S., Europe, Japan and theSoviet Union are forced to make huge investments in roads,airports, and sewer systems. That investment should createdemand for bulldozers and other big machines, each of whichuses hundreds of bearings. At the same time, factories arebeing rebuilt with intricate machinery, all moving withfriction-reducing bearings.   The tapered roller bearing, which is still the company'smain product, resists extreme pressures from any direction.As such, the bearings are used wherever heavy loads and sidepressure combine to put stress on the bearings, including carand truck wheels, construction machinery and factoryequipment.   The $1 billion spending plan is especially ambitious forTimken, which has been controlled by the Timken family sinceHenry H. Timken invented the tapered roller bearing backbefore the turn of the century. W.R. Timken Jr., the currentchairman, is a great-grandson of the founder. Joseph F. TootJr., Timken's president, was married to Mr. Timken's sister.Family members still vote 19% of the stock, and an employeesavings plan owns an additional 5.5%.   The company, whose spartan executive offices are at thefront of Timken's old bearings factory, is extremelyconservative. Management has kept Timken's debt to a minimum,usually less than 5% of total capital. Moreover, executivesonly slowly expanded business, resisting the urge todiversify through acquisitions that caused problems for manyother industrial companies. Sales in 1989 were only 20%higher than a decade earlier.   But Timken isn't mired in the past. The company was one ofthe first to switch to a business jet from propeller-drivenplanes. Management refuses to slash research and developmentspending even when incurring losses; last year's outlay of$37.4 million is high for a smokestack company. The companyis credited with advances both in metallurgy andmanufacturing techniques that increased the life of itsbearings severalfold.   Timken also took a gamble a few years back to build thenew Faircrest steel mill, which produces alloy steels used inTimken bearings. Specialty steel also accounts for nearlyone-third of the company's $1.5 billion of annual sales. Themill was completed ahead of schedule and below budget, and isregarded as one of the most technologically advanced in thecountry.   But the timing of the construction was off. The dollarsoared while the mill was being built, inviting in foreignsteel at low prices, depressing U.S. exports and cripplingmany industries that use steel. That combination created asteel surplus that drove down prices. While conditions haveimproved, Timken executives complain that prices for thealloy steel bars that the mill produces remain depressed.   &quot;Timken is one of the companies with very long planninghorizons that are rebuilding this country,&quot; says RonaldPetrie, machinery and manufacturing analyst with McDonald andamp;Co., Cleveland. &quot;They're not as concerned about quarterlyearnings gains as with the long-term growth of the company.&quot;   He forecasts net of $2.50 a share for 1990 and $4 a sharefor 1991, assuming that the economies of the U.S., WesternEurope and Asian and the Pacific region continue to showgradual improvement.   Earlier this week, Timken completed the $185 millionpurchase of MPB Corp., Keene, N.H., moving the smokestackconcern into the precision aircraft bearings business.Besides opening another segment of the world bearings market,buying MPB offers an opportunity for transfer of technologyin precision manufacturing and specialty materials -- such ashigh temperature ceramics -- that will strengthen Timken'sposition in industrial markets.</TEXT></DOC>
