The government would announce the date once it finalized detailsto shut down Pulau Bidong island camp, said Foreign Minister AbuHassan Omar.   ``The island will be gazetted (declared) a prohibited area andrefugees arriving in Malaysia after that date will be turned away,''he said after opening the Asia and Pacific Regional Seminar onRefugees and Displaced Persons.   Abu Hassan said rejecting the boat people formed the first phaseof the government's decision to close the camp, which now housesabout 12,900 refugees.   The second phase, he said, was the final closure once allrefugees had been repatriated to their own country or resettled inwilling third countries.   Pulau Bidong, an island 180 miles from Kuala Lumpur on the eastcoast of Peninsular Malaysia, was turned into a refugee center afterthe 1975 communist victory in Vietnam, when thousands of Vietnamesefled to the shores of Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries.   The government has spent about $26.23 million to maintain thecamp, Abu Hassan said.   Addressing the seminar, he said Malaysia was not prepared to openits doors to the boat people because they had abused the temporaryasylum provided them. He did not elaborate.   He said more refugees had come to Malaysia between January andSeptember this year than throughout last year. There were 1,008arrivals last month, he said.   ``Until the principle of first asylum is correctly addressed bythe international community, the phenomena will one day beremembered as a problem rather than a solution,'' Abu Hassan said.   He called on Vietnam to prevent the illegal departure of itspeople and to accept the return of those not selected for finalresettlement in third countries.</TEXT></DOC>
