(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker on Wednesdaydefended his stewardship of the ministry before it soughtbankruptcy protection, denying an IRS claim that the church boughthim such luxuries as two Rolls-Royce cars.   ``We believe in our faith that the church is the center ofsociety,'' Bakker told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds.``Everything we did came under the umbrella of the church. Therewas no profit in anything we did.''   Bakker took the stand in PTL's $52 million lawsuit which claimshe, his wife, Tammy, and former top aide David Taggart mismanagedthe ministry into ruin and used PTL funds for their personal gain.   Referring to an IRS report listing items it said the ministryhad provided Bakker for his personal benefit, Bakker said hepersonally paid for a houseboat, an unfinished 300-foot water slideat his home and the two luxury cars.   Bakker said he donated the houseboat and cars to PTL, as well asa third Rolls-Royce which was given to him.   ``I had in regular practice given back to the ministry. Part ofChristianity is giving,'' he said. ``The Heritage Village Churchhas never, ever purchased a Rolls-Royce for me or my family.''   Bakker said a jet PTL officials claim he used at will forpersonal travel was only actually used by him ``between 10 and 20times.''   ``As far as I'm concerned all of the trips were for theministry,'' he said.   In other testimony, independent financial analyst James Wilsonsuggested that Bakker was underpaid for the number ofresponsibilities he held. Bakker, he said, should have receivedabout $6.5 million a year before fringe benefits. Tammy Faye Bakkercould have been paid more than $2 million a year for her duties.   Last month the ministry presented evidence that the Bakkersreceived about $9.5 million in bonuses, salaries and othercompensation from 1983 to 1987.   PTL sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its creditorsthree months after Bakker left in March 1987, when he admitted to asexual encounter with former church secretary Jessica Hahn.   Bakker said he assumed responsibility for the way PTL dealt withMs. Hahn, but said he didn't know about the hush money it offeredher.   ``But I knew we were being blackmailed and I take fullresponsibility,'' he responded to a question by his attorney RyanHovis.   Also testifying for Bakker's defense was Allen Andrews, directorof corporate finances for Lockheed Corp., who audited some of PTL'sfinancial statements and records for the period of Bakker'sstewardship.   ``We found the corporation seemed to be solvent, had good assetsand revenues that seemed to be growing,'' Andrews said. Bakker'sattorney Ryan Hovis said the audit was conducted over the pastseveral weeks.   Andrews said PTL ``generally looked like it was in soundcondition.''   He also said that the considerable travel expenditures and cashadvances, such as those received by Bakker before his resignationin March 1987, were normal procedure for the chief executive of acorporation.   An IRS agent has testified he found cash advances to Bakker andTaggart that apparently served no legitimate business purpose.   A federal grand jury in Charlotte, N.C., has been investigatingfor more than a year whether the ministry raised money for onepurpose and used it for another.</TEXT></DOC>
