Ouraccomodation resources have simply been overwhelmed,'' said HongKong refugee coordinator Mike Hanson.   Officials said 745 boat people arrived today and 109 were towedto Tai A Chau, an island 20 miles southwest of Hong Kong, becauseother refugee facilities were filled.   Hanson said the boat people would be staying in their boat or onthe dock at Tai A Chau. ``There is one school building which somepeople may be able to use, but I think most will not be able tohave covered accomodations,'' he said.   Hanson said the boat people would remain on the island until thegovernment could find a place to process them.   In June, Hong Kong adopted a screening policy that treats allincoming Vietnamese boat people as illegal immigrants subject torepatriation unless they can prove they fled political persecution.   But the policy has not curbed the mounting arrivals ofVietnamese. For the first five months in 1989, 13,182 boat peoplehave arrived at the British colony.   Under international pressure, Vietnam has agreed to attend aninternational conference on Indochinese refugees in Geneva on June13-14.</TEXT></DOC>
