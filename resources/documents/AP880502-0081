One day earlier, during a stop in Toledo, the front-runner forthe Democratic presidential nomination said his likely Novemberopponent, Vice President George Bush, did nothing to stop theReagan administration from dealing with drug runners instead offighting the nation's drug problem.   Today, at a day-care center in a Cincinnati high school, Dukakisread a story to 12 children whose mothers attend the school.   ``This is the kind of thing we need,'' Dukakis said of thecenter. ``We need to have it as a matter of national policy.''   The Massachusetts governor, wrapping up his Ohio campaign withstops in four cities today, also called for stepped-up federalefforts to help collect child support from delinquent fathers.   Dukakis, looking for big wins Tuesday in Ohio and Indiana tocement his position in the race, also said Sunday that communityintervention, not capital punishment, is the best way to curb drugtrafficking.   Dukakis met Sunday with law enforcement officials in Toledo andAkron, countering Bush's recent focus on crime and drugs with sharpcriticisms of past Reagan administration dealings with Panamanianstrongman Manuel Antonio Noriega. Noriega is now under U.S.indictment on drug charges.   Dukakis also suggested the administration tolerated drugsmugglers who were used to help resupply the administration-backedNicaraguan Contra rebels.   ``What kind of message is that for the courageous policeofficers, school superintendents, teachers, educators and parentsand the children of the United States of America?'' Dukakis askedin Toledo.   ``This is an administration that can't say no to drug dealersitself. How can it tell our kids to do that?'' Dukakis asked. ``Thegreatest threat to our security in this hemisphere is not theSandinistas, it's the avalanche of drugs that is flowing into thiscountry.''   While he frequently attacked Bush, Dukakis made no directreferences to Jesse Jackson, his sole remaining active Democraticrival. But he urged supporters to ignore a new poll showing himwith an overwhelming lead in the race for Ohio's 159 Democraticdelegates.   ``My friends, pollsters don't vote, people do,'' Dukakis said.   Dukakis used the backdrop of a county jail in Toledo andconfiscated drugs and weapons at a police station in Akron tounderscore his attacks on Reagan administration drug policy.   Bush, the certain Republican nominee, has called on Dukakis andJackson to support the death penalty for major drug suppliers.   ``It's been tried,'' said Dukakis, a staunch opponent of capitalpunishment. ``It doesn't work.''   Instead, he called for greater cooperation between federal,state and local law enforcement and education officials andincreased federal funding for drug programs.   Such efforts, Dukakis said, have been ``jerked around'' duringthe Reagan years because of funding cuts.   ``If we're going to solve the problem, it's got to be at thecommunity level,'' Dukakis said from the steps of the county jailin Toledo.   From there he went on to Tony Packo's, a restaurant oftenreferred to by the fictional character Max Klinger in thetelevision series ``M.A.S.H.''   There, Dukakis lashed out at Attorney General Edwin Meese III, afavorite target in his effort to tie Bush to a long list ofallegedly improper activity in the Reagan administration.   ``I want to be a president who will appoint an attorney generalyou and I can be proud of and who will put justice back in theDepartment of Justice,'' Dukakis said.   Earlier Sunday, in Cleveland, Dukakis said he could not describeBush's role as vice president because he had not distinguishedhimself on any issue.   ``I'm not sure I can answer what that role has been, frankly,because he's such a blank slate,'' Dukakis said.   While in Cleveland, Dukakis participated in a May Day parade ina Polish neighborhood.   The poll of Ohio residents released Sunday by the Akron BeaconJournal showed Dukakis with a nearly 3-1 lead over Jackson _ 62percent to 22 percent _ with 16 percent undecided and a 3.5percentage point margin of error. The poll was conducted over 10days beginning April 20.</TEXT></DOC>
