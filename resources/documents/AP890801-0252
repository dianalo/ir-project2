The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was down 14.61points at 2,646.05 as of 3 p.m. EDT.   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advancing ones on the NewYork Stock Exchange, with 787 issues lower, 706 higher and 478unchanged.   Volume on the Big Board totaled 195.15 million shares.   The National Association of Purchasing Management said today itsindex of the economy slumped to 46 percent in July, its lowestreading since an identical one in January 1983.   Also pointing toward slow growth was a Commerce Departmentreport on a decline in construction spending.   Before the reports' release the Dow Jones industrial average hadbeen up 13 points. It fell and was briefly down about 8 points,then recovered.   Stock investors are nervous that the market may have risen tooquickly and is due for a downturn. Monday's rally carried the DowJones average to within 60 points of its record high, 2,722.42 onAug. 25, 1987.   Traders have been taking confidence from signs of declininginterest rates. Bond prices rallied on Monday and the price gainscontinued in today's trading.   But the economic slowdown that helps the inflation-sensitivebond market is not so good for the stock market because slow growthcould hurt corporate profits.   ``It's that balancing act,'' said Larry Wachtel, an analyst forPrudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``Of course we know the economyhas been softening, but bad news has been good news up to now.''   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks wasdown 0.83 at 191.58. At the American Stock Exchange, the marketvalue index was down 0.41 at 376.15.</TEXT></DOC>
