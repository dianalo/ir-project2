On May 4, 1988, the GATT Council of Representatives (``GATTCouncil'') authorized establishment of a dispute settlement panel, underGATT Article XXIII:2, to examine the United States complaint regardingKorea's import restrictions on beef.On May 24, 1989, the GATT dispute settlement panel issued a report concludingthat Korea's import restrictions on beef are contrary to the provisionsof GATT Article XI:1, and not justified for balance-of-payments purposesin light of the improvement of the Korean balance-of-payments situation.The panel recommended prompt establishment of a timetable for phasing outKorea's restrictions on beef. At meetings of the GATT Council on June 21and July 19, 1989, Korea declined to agree to adoption of the panel report.Adoption will be reviewed again in October 1989.Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 2414, as amended by section 1301 of the Omnibus Tradeand Competitiveness Act of 1988, the USTR is required to determine whetherKorea's import restrictions deny ``rights to which the United States isentitled'' under the GATT and whether such practices are unjustifiableor unreasonable and burden or restrict U.S. commerce. This determinationmust be made no later than September 28, 1989, which is 18 months afterthe date of initiation of this investigation.On the basis of the GATT panel report on this matter, the USTR has determinedthat rights to which the United States is entitled under a trade agreement(the GATT) are denied by Korea's restrictions on imports of beef. Section301(a)(1) of the Trade Act provides that if the USTR makes such a determination,the USTR shall take action authorized under section 301(c) subject to thespecific direction, if any, of the President. The USTR has determined thatthe appropriate action to take under section 301(c) is to suspend the applicationof GATT tariff concessions with respect to Korea, affecting products ofKorea in an amount that is equivalent in value to the burden or restrictionon United States commerce.Section 305(a)(1) provides that any action to be taken under section 301shall be implemented within 30 days_in this case, by October 28, 1989.Section 305(a)(2) further provides that such implementation may be delayedby not more than 180 days if the USTR determines that a delay is necessaryor desirable to obtain U.S. rights under a trade agreement. The USTR hasdecided that it is desirable to delay implementation of action under section301 in this case beyond October 28, 1989, to allow additional time forproceedings in the GATT. However, the USTR has directed that a list ofpotential products on which to impose increased duties be published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> by mid-November 1989 for public comment, if bythat time substantial movement toward a resolution of this matter has notoccurred.<ITAG tagnum="6">A.
