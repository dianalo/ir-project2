It also accused an official of Nicaragua's leading businessorganization of working for the CIA and running a spy network thatstole government documentsccording to press reports Thursday.   The Interior Ministry said Mario Jose Alegria Castillo and twogovernment officials had been detained in the case.

Hondurassaid an undetermined number of Sandinista soldiers were killed.   Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto said the fighting occurred inNicaragua, with rebels, and a Nicaraguan soldier was captured andtaken to San Agustin.   Carlos Lopez, the Honduran foreign minister, protested theborder incident and d'Escoto replied:   ``The crude manipulation of the facts contained in your notereveals the real aim of this campaign (which is) to try to createan incident between Honduras and Nicaragua'' and to damage peacetalks between the Sandinista government and the U.S.-supportedrebels, known as Contras.   ``Acts that occurred in Nicaragua are being presented as if theyoccurred on Honduran soil and ... the armed forces of Hondurastakes upon itself crimes that in reality have been committed by theContras,'' he said.   During the 6-year-old Nicaraguan civil war, the Contras have hadbases in southern Honduras from which they have launched attacksacross the border. The Contras and Sandinistas have agreed to atemporary truce during which they are trying to negotiate apermanent cease-fire.
