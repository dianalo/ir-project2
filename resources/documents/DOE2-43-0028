Following parameters are investigated:Lung function test as pneumotachography, the estimation of airways hyperreactivityby carbachol challenge and skin prick test with the most important inhalantallergens. In addition, a standardized questionnaire on personal andfamiliar history, social status and potential indoor air pollutants exposure(heating, smoking habits, characteristics of the house, furnishing) iscompleted by a trained interviewer. The transversal follows a longitudinalpart of the study, a 2,5 year observation period with annual reexaminationof all patients. To evaluate the parthogenetic relevance of indoor airpollutants 120 persons were observed in an imbedded case-control-study.Indoor pollutant levels (SO/sub 2/, NO/sub x/ and dust) are monitoredby means of passive sampling method in weekly intervals. An additionalevaluation of meteorological data according to the geographic location(Rhein valley and Black Forest area) is performed. Indoor and outdoorfactors will be correlated with the incidence and follow up of bronchopulmonarydisorders in children and their parents.</TEXT></DOC>
