Brady has urgedthe Senate to increase the national debt ceiling by $300 billionbefore its August recess to avert problems with issuing paychecksand Social Security payments.   ``If the Congress were to recess before the debt limit isincreased _ in addition to very likely defaulting on interestpayments and other obligations _ the United States could not honor$3 billion of military retirement and salary payments on Aug. 31 orpayments totaling over $20 billion to Social Security andsupplemental security income recipients, railroad and civil serviceretirees and veterans on Sept. 1,'' Brady said in letters to Senateleaders.   Copies of the letters, dated Friday, were released Tuesday.   ``Our current estimates show that the permanent debt ceiling of$2.8 trillion will be sufficient only to early August,'' Brady said.   Brady said the $3.1 trillion limit in the House-passed version ofthe debt ceiling bill would be sufficient for the remainder of thefiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.</TEXT></DOC>
