Ralph David Abernathy and his memoirs' publisher,claiming she is the woman he implied slept with the Rev. MartinLuther King Jr. the night before he was slain.   The U.S. District Court lawsuit names Abernathy, who was an aideto King; Harper andamp; Row, which published his book, ``And the WallsCame Tumbling Down;'' and a Harper andamp; Row editor, Daniel Bial.   The plaintiff, Adjuda Abi Naantaabuu, said the defendants``falsely and maliciously charge, and caused the readers of thisbook to believe, that she had engaged in adulterous behavior andsexual relations with Dr. Martin Luther King on the last night ofhis life.''   Naantaabuu, who was identified as a beautician who also works inthe civil rights movement, claimed she has suffered great mentalanguish because she has been ridiculed and her reputation has beeninjured.   In the book, Abernathy wrote that he awoke for a nap in awoman's living room after a late-night dinner on April 3, 1968, tosee King and the woman emerge from a bedroom.   The book drew criticism from many of Abernathy's comrades in thecivil rights movement of the 1960s.   Naantaabuu did not give her version of the story in the lawsuit,but in earlier interviews has said she was the host of the dinnerand that she and her sister talked with King and another aide inthe living room while Abernathy slept on her bed.   ``Everyone in Memphis knew that Dr. King had been at my housethe night before his assassination,'' Naantaabuu said in astatement released by her attorney. ``Dr. Abernathy's book has castshadows on my character. Even my own granddaughter asked me whetherI had had an affair with Dr. King.''   A call to Abernathy's office in Atlanta was unanswered Mondayevening. A spokesman at Harper andamp; Row also could not be reached forcomment.</TEXT></DOC>
