The Greensboro, N.C., textile company said this month thatit is seeking to buy back and retire as much as $445 millionface value of its junk bonds by offering cut-rate prices tobondholders. For most of the past year, Burlington's bondshave traded at big discounts to face value, reflectinginvestors' concern about the company's ability to pay itsdebts as scheduled.</LP><TEXT>   In the offer documents, Burlington said it has beenexperiencing a &quot;significant erosion&quot; in operatingperformance. In the six months ended March 30, Burlington hada $51.7 million loss on sales of $1 billion. Long-term debttotaled $1.93 billion. While the company said operatingresults improved in the quarter ended June 29, the companysaid it can't tell if the upturn will be sustained.   Burlington said that if the offer to bondholders isn'tsuccessful, the company will be unable to comply withfinancial-ratio levels required as of Dec. 31 under variouslending agreements. In that event, Burlington said, it wouldneed to start talks with its bank lenders seeking amendmentsor waivers to its loan accords.   If banks don't provide the needed waivers, Burlingtonsaid, the banks could block Burlington from paying intereston its junk bonds, terminate other loan commitments, and layclaim to collateral at Burlington or its parent company,Burlington Holdings Inc. Also problematic, Burlington said,will be the company's ability to start paying cash interestin 1994 on several junk-bond issues that don't currently paycash interest.   Burlington also said that: &quot;In the event that a bankruptcycase concerning one or more of the companies should becommenced, there are certain risks . . . that could affectthe amount that holders of securities might receive.&quot; ABurlington spokesman declined to say how likely or remote theprospect of a bankruptcy-law filing was.   Burlington did say that completing its bond offer &quot;shouldreduce, but will not eliminate&quot; various financial risks.   &quot;This company isn't out of the woods yet,&quot; said AndersMaxwell, a junk-bond analyst at Lazard Freres andamp; Co. &quot;Thenumbers aren't reassuring, either before or after theexchange.&quot;   Despite all of the grim language from Burlington, somebondholders appear to be holding out for better terms. Oneholder of Burlington bonds dismissed the company's mention ofa bankruptcy-law filing as &quot;standard rhetoric&quot; in an attemptto pry bonds from holders at less than face value.   Many of Burlington's junk bonds are trading at pricesabove those being offered by the company in its tender offer.Burlington's 13 7/8% Series B notes were quoted yesterday atabout 73 cents on the dollar; Burlington is seeking to buythem from holders at 50 cents to 55 cents on the dollar.   Burlington also disclosed that Bear Stearns andamp; Co., thedealer manager for the tender offer, will collect a fee of$750,000 plus 0.75% of the face value of the bonds tendered.   Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., which took Burlington private in a1987 leveraged buy-out, will collect a $150,000 advisory fee.</TEXT></DOC>
