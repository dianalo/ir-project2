(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A veterinarian who treated HenryKissinger's dog for cancer says he was impressed with the devotionthat the former secretary of state showed to the dying animal.   ``I was expecting Kissinger to be a little intimidating,considering his stature in the world, But he was just a regular guywho loved his dog,'' said Gregory MacEwen, a University ofWisconsin veterinarian.   MacEwen met Kissinger last month for a few hours when MacEwenflew to New York to treat Kissinger's ailing yellow Labradorretriever for cancer. The dog died last week, MacEwen said.   ``He got right down on the floor with his dog in his three-piecesuit, talking to him, totally flat out, just telling Tyler (thedog) how much he loved him,'' MacEwen said.   The dog suffered from a form of bone cancer that spread to thedog's spine and paralyzed it.   MacEwen said an innovative liposome cancer treatment, which usesthe body's own immune system to attack the cancer, may have workedhad the disease not progressed to the spine.   However, the dog lived out its life in less pain, he said.   Kissinger went to the National Cancer Institute after learningthe dog had cancer. Kissinger wanted to avoid chemotherapy becauseof the dog's ill health and age, MacEwen said.   A former NCI official recommended that Kissinger contact MacEwen.</TEXT></DOC>
