TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Supporters of a new dialogue between liberalIsraelis and Palestinians said Thursday it could lead tonegotiations with the PLO, but some right-wing opponents view thoseinvolved as traitors.   The controversy has created new tensions in the uneasy governingcoalition of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's conservative Likud blocand the more dovish Labor Party.   Two private meetings were held this week by three prominentPalestinans who support the Palestine Liberation Organization andleading Labor Party members close to Finance Minister Shimon Peres,the party leader.   Liberal parliament members and other Israelis opposed to thegovernment policy of refusing to talk with the PLO also have flownto Europe to participate in academic forums, debates and conferenceswith PLO officials.   At least four conferences are scheduled in the coming weeks. Suchforums skirt an Israeli law making contact with the PLO punishableby up to three years in jail.   Peres hinted that he may join the informal discussions laterdespite opposition within his party.   Avraham Burg, a Labor dove who attended one of the meetings,would not reveal what was discussed but said one aim of the dialoguewas to ``create an awareness'' that Israel could not ignore thePalestinians.   ``We both suffered from an on-going process of demonization ofthe enemy,'' he said. ``I want the Israelis to realize thatsomething is going on, and ... that we have no excuse any more tosay there is nobody to talk to.''   Galia Golan, a Hebrew University professor who attended aconference with PLO officials in the Netherlands last week, found it``very encouraging'' and said: ``They have come to the conclusionthey must negotiate, and must limit their demands. They've come along way.''   Faisal Husseini, a Palestinian who heads the Arab Studies Centerin Jerusalem and is close to Yasser Arafat, said he joined the talksto explain PLO positions so they would seem less threatening toIsraelis.   ``It is time to go and talk to these people, and let them see themonster face to face, and see he is not a monster,'' he saidTuesday, adding that he wants the meetings to involve other thanleftist Israelis.   ``Palestinians are accepting the idea of meeting with Israelismore close to the center,'' he said.   Husseini, 48, is the scion of a prominent Jerusalem family. Hisfather was a military commander and his grandfather mayor of thecity.   Also involved in the talks with Israeli politicials were Ziad AbuZiad, a journalist, and philosphy professor Sari Nusseibah.   Right-wing members of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, attackedthe dialogue with Palestinians and Eliezer Waldman of the Tehiyaparty said Israeli participants should be tried for ``working withthe enemies of Israel.''   Yossi Ahimeir, spokesman for the prime minister, said: ``We don'tconsider these meetings as important. On the contrary, it will notcome to anything.''   Of the Israelis involved, he said: ``These people are not incharge of making policy for the state.''   Some contacts with Palestinian supporters of the PLO have beenmade by defense officials and senior army officers as part of aninitiative by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a Labor Party hawk.   Rabin raised the possibility Thursday of negotiating for anundefined ``political entity'' with elected Palestinians from Jordanand the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where an uprising beganmore than 14 months ago.   He promised ``really free elections ... to choose politicalrepresentation to conduct negotiations with us on a politicalprocess that would not immediately reach a permanent solution. Wecan't resolve that problem at once.''   Speaking on Israel's Arabic television program, Rabin indicatedflexibility about withdrawing the army from voting areas on electiondays and providing guarantees that no one would interefere withvoting. He promised to force a Cabinet vote if Palestinians acceptedhis proposal, even with reservations.   Many Palestinians suspect, however, that Israel is trying tocreate an unacceptable local alternative to Arafat's leadership.   ``The Israelis, in their rejection of talking to the PLO, aretrying to find someone else to talk to,'' said Haidar Abdul Shafi,head of the Red Crescent Society in the Gaza Strip. ``They aretrying to dismember the Palestinians in the territories from thoseoutside.''   Rabin's intitiative appears to have been the genesis of theunofficial talks between Husseini and Labor Party doves. Husseinimet with Defense Ministry official Shmuel Goren while still in jaillast month.   Husseini had been in jail without trial during most of thePalestinian uprising, suspected of involvement in undergroundactivities.</TEXT></DOC>
