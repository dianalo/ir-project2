Britain's 19 embassy staff members and the four French Embassyworkers flew aboard a chartered plane to New Delhi and arrived thereSaturday evening. Their departure from Kabul was delayed a daybecause of a storm.   A convoy of about 40 Soviet military vehicles rolled out of thesnowy capital about 3 a.m., headed toward the border.   On Friday, a huge column of tanks, armored personnel carriers andtrucks slipped out under cover of darkness and headed up the SalangHighway, the only route between Kabul and the Soviet border.   The deputy foreign minister of the Soviet Union, Yuli Vorontsov,was quoted as saying the Red Army will be out of the country wellahead of the Feb. 15 deadline set by a U.N.-mediated accord.   ``Within four days, there will be no Soviet forces inAfghanistan,'' Vorontsov was quoted as saying by Iran's officialTehran Radio during a visit to Iran.   The radio said Vorontsov would discuss with Iranian officials andAfghan resistance leaders the future of Afghanistan after theSoviets leave.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Pakistanon the same mission early Sunday and was expected to propose apolitical settlement.   ``The Soviet leadership has decided to consult with thegovernment of Pakistan on how best to contribute to restoring peaceand tranquility in Afghanistan,'' Shevardnadze told reporters beforea scheduled day of talks with Pakistani officials who support theguerrillas.   But he added, ``Problems have been piling up. There are quite afew of them.''   Pakistani Defense Minister Ghulam Sarwar Cheema said Saturday inthe Saudi capital of Riyadh that his government has formed acommittee to oversee resettlement of the 3 million Afghan refugeesliving in Pakistan.   ``The process of shifting Afghan refugees from Pakistan to theirhomeland will be handled smoothly after complete evacuation of theSoviet forces from Afghanistan,'' said Cheema, on a state visit toSaudi Arabia.   Guerrilla leaders, meanwhile, warned they might launch a majorattack on the strategic city of Jalalabad, about 90 miles east ofKabul.   Abdul Zaher, a senior commander of the Jamiat-i-Islami guerrillagroup, said the insurgents did not want to attack the crowded cityfor fear of injuring civilians but that they might if communistforces there don't give up soon.   Jalalabad could be the first major Afghan city to fall to theguerrillas, local insurgent commanders said. They said its fallwould weaken the defense of Kabul and open up the highway to thecapital.   In and around Kabul, Afghan solders patrol the streets andoutdoor markets. The armored personnel carriers once stationed inthe crowded bazaars are gone.   Western countries began pulling their diplomats from Kabul latelast month because of fears for their safety once the Soviets aregone and Afghan troops are left to battle Moslem guerrillas alone.   The Soviets intervened in December 1979 to back Afghan troops intheir war with the Moslem guerrillas. They began pulling theirestimated 100,000 soldiers out in May, in accordance with the U.N.accord.   Soviet and Afghan officials have estimated there are about 1,000Soviet soldiers still in Afghanistan, including a small contingentassigned to Kabul airport.   Giant Ilyushin-76 transport planes have been flying into Kabulferrying supplies of flour and other goods in short supply.   Britain quietly shut its embassy early Saturday. ``We didn't wanta public display,'' said one diplomat, referring to the highlypublicized flag-lowering ceremony when the U.S. Embassy closed.   Britain's highest-ranking diplomat in Kabul, Ian Mackley, said helooked forward to returning home. Mackley was married Jan. 21 inBritain and returned to Kabul on Jan. 22.   ``I postponed my honeymoon to come here. I hope to resume itfairly soon,'' he said.   The French charge d'affaires, Raymond Petit, saw his staff off atthe airport. He said he plans to leave Kabul on Monday and wasstaying over to ``lock the doors.''   West Germany, Italy and Japan also have closed their embassies,and some eastern European and Asian countries are reducing theirstaff.   President Najib denounced the moves Thursday as ``psychologicalwarfare ... trying to create panic and embarrass and confuse publicopinion.''   He said diplomats would be safe in Kabul after Feb. 15.</TEXT></DOC>
