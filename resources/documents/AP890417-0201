Dubcek was removed as Czechoslovakia's Communist Party leaderafter the invasion and remained out of public view for years.Recently he has been commenting on the actions that ended hisreforms known as the ``Prague spring.''   He criticized former Communist Party chief Janos Kadar in aninterview carried on the Hungarian television program ``Panorama.''   It was believed to be the first time an interview with Dubcekwas broadcast by an official news channel in a Soviet-bloc country.   The official MTI news agency on Monday carried excerpts of theinterview.   MTI reported Dubcek said Kadar or Wladyslaw Gokmulka, Poland'sCommunist Party leader in 1968, could have stopped the invasion byrefusing to participate.   He was quoted as saying, ``I hoped that Kadar would finally sayno to the intervention ... or that Gomulka might have the strengthto do so.   ``Kadar and Gomulka would have had to do their utmost becausethey alone would have been able to prevent the intervention.''   Romania was the only Warsaw Pact country that refused to takepart in the invasion.   MTI reported Dubcek rejected claims by some of Kadar'ssupporters that he agreed to support the Soviet invasion to protecteconomic reforms being introduced in Hungary. The agency quotedDubcek as saying that because of the invasion the ``reform movementslowed down for 20 years not only in Czechoslovakia but also in theSoviet Union and Hungary.''   MTI did not say where or when Dubcek was interviewed.   Kadar, accused by some party officials of blocking Hungarianreforms in the 1970s, was replaced by Karoly Grosz last May.Gomulka was removed as Poland's party leader in 1970.   In another development Monday, Hungary's Communist Partyrepealed its decision to expell four leaders who had been accusedof harming party unity.   The decision by the party's central control commission came twodays after some 600 communist reformers met in Kecskemet and somespeakers supported the idea of splitting away from the CommunistParty.   Two of the four who were expelled a year ago, economist LaszloLengyel and political scientist Mihaly Bihari, addressed theKecskemet meeting. The other two are parliamentarian Zoltan Kiralyand Zoltan Biro, who last month was elected to the presidium of theDemocratic Forum.   All four have been associated with the Democratic Forum, areform organization established in September 1987. It has becomeone of the most influential of dozens of independent movements inHungary.   It was not known if the four would decide to rejoin theCommunist Party now that Kadar has been removed.</TEXT></DOC>
