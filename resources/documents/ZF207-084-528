 HUD awarded the contract last May.andM;As the new computers arrive, HUD is able to bring more computing power to itsusers and reallocate older PCs to less demanding users, said Brian Hall,director of HUD's Computer Services Group.andP;  Another goal is to eliminatededicated word processor hardware by the end of the fiscal year, he said.andM;HUD's contract with Federal Technology may be worth about $2 million if HUDexercises the four one-year options, Hall said.andP;  It covers only hardware andperipherals.andP;  HUD has other contracts for software, maintenance and training.andM;Most of the new PCs include a 20M hard disk, a 1.2M 5-1/4-inch floppy drive,1M of memory, a 101-key keyboard, a monochrome monitor and a dot-matrixprinter, Hall said.andP;  That configuration costs about $2,000.andP;  Other userschoose color monitors and laser printers from the options, all of which arepriced separately, he said.andM;HUD and Federal Technology recently negotiated a change in the contract toprovide Zenith Z-184 laptops in place of the Spark laptops from DatavueCorp., Norcross, Ga., in the contract, Hall said.andM;Federal Technology is required to burn in, test and install the computerswithin 60 days of receiving an order, Hall said.andP;  HUD is reprocuring itsmaintenance contract, currently held by Unisys Corp., he said.andM;Standard software for the PCs includes Lotus 1-2-3 Version 2.01,Ashton-Tate's dBase III+, Peter Norton Computing's Utilities, Honeywell BullInc.'s VIP terminal emulation software and Meridian Technology Inc.'s CarbonCopy software for remotely operating another PC.andP;  The new PCs use MS-DOSVersion 3.2.andM;New StandardandM;Another standard is WordPerfect 5.0, which most users are adopting in placeof Samna IV Plus from Samna Corp., Atlanta, Hall said.andP;  HUD's softwarecontract is with Software Control International of Arlington, Va.andM;Under a reorganization a year ago, Hall's group is responsible for all ofHud's computers once the agency has agreed to acquire them, he said.andP;  Thatincludes all the PCs plus four Unisys 1100-series mainframes, five Honeywell9/65 minicomputers used for managing wide area networks, terminals for themainframes and dedicated word processing machines.andM;The Computer Services Group deals with mainframes, computer rooms,telecomunication, end-user acquisition and maintenance.andP;  The group'steleprocessing division is responsible specifically for telecommunication andend-users, including local and wide area networks, terminals, PCs, dedicatedword processors and other hardware, Hall said.andM;The group controls the budget for buying computers once others at HUD havejustified their purchases.andP;  HUD's assistant secretaries establish theircomputer needs at budget time and only some regional offices have limitedpurchasing authority.andP;  They are allowed to acquire computer equipment andsoftware from the standard technology contracts.andP;  An average regionalallocation is about $65,000, Hall said.andM;Distributed PowerandM;As at most agencies, HUD uses many of its PCs for stand-alone wordprocessing, database management and other single-user applications.andP;  Inaddition, PCs provide much of the processing power for HUD applicationsrunning on mainframes and LANs, Hall said.andM;Applications that run on PCs, LANs and mainframes include SMIRPH, the Systemfor Management Information Retrieval in Public Housing; SEAS, the retionalSecurity and Accounting System; and MIPS, the Multifamily InformationProcessing System.andM;Other systems run on mainframes and PCs or on networked PCs, Hall said.andP;  Inaddition, HUD uses PCs to send information to the Agriculture Department'sNational Finance Center in New Orleans, which has been handling HUD's payrollsince last year.andM;Hall pointed out that the department is many different things, serving as amortgage banker, loan insurance company, and property manager, with loans andproperty all over the United States.andM;Hud also is increasing the number of local area networks, especially inregional offices, Hall said.andP;  There are about 80 LANs so far, he said, andthe agency plans to have 90 before the end of the fiscal year.andP;  The LANs useNovell's NetWare operating system and token-ring protocol.andP;  HUD's contractorfor LANs is Capital Systems Resources Inc., Vienna, Va., recently acquired bySystemhouse Inc., Arlington, Va., Hall said.andM;In addition to the 10 regional offices, HUD has 81 field offices, the largest50 of which have LANs, Hall said.andP;  Some regional offices have two LANs, hesaid.andP;  HUD last year created a new position, automated technologyadministrator, to support the computers and users in these offices.andP;  Inregional cities, the field office is located with the regional office, Hallsaid.andM;Some of the local networks are used for office automation, he said.andP;  Otherstie into the HUDnet wide area network, helping share databases all overcountry and at HUD headquarters in Washington.andP;  For example, he said,regional accounting directors have a LAN they use to feed data to aheadquarters mainframe through HUDnet.andP;  The headquarters mainframes houseabout 150 nationwide application systems, he said.andM;HUD is in the early stages of using LANs as communication devices providingelectronic mail and calendaring, he said.andP;  The agency &quot;is still not 100percent settled on E-mail,&quot; though one candidate is cc: Mail from cc: MailInc., Palo Alto, Calif., he said.andP;  HUD is looking at a couple of calendaringpackages, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
