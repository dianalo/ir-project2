A delegation of the families of victims of the Lockerbie airdisaster arrived in Malta Saturday with a letter urging George Bushand Mikhail S. Gorbachev to impose an economic squeeze on suchcountries as Syria and Iran for their alleged backing of terrorism.   On Sunday, they planned to drop 270 flowers in the storm-tossedMediterranean in remembrance of those killed when a terrorist bombripped apart the Pan Am airliner over the Scottish town lastDecember 21.   Many of the groups had planned to deliver statements to Bush orGorbachev aides, most of whom were tied up in the storm-tossedmeetings or not reachable at their hotels or the Maxim Gorky linerdocked at Marsaxlokk Bay.   Dr. Jim Swire said he had confirmation, however ,that thedelegation's four-page message had been received at the White House.   At another venue, Margaret Papandreou and her women's peacenetwork claiming to represent `` millions of women around the world(who) have sent representatives to all summit meetings'', urged anend to nuclear testing, chemical and biological arms ban and thestrengthening of the United Nations.   The women were joined by Greenpeace, who held a news conferenceurging the ban on naval nuclear and strategic naval weapons. TheGreenpeace activists said they would try to interfere with animpending Trident II missile test off the coast of Cape Canaveral,Fla.   Other groups with delegations include the National Conferencefor Soviet Jewry, and the Maltese Labor Party _ presently out ofpower in the Maltese grovernment _ which organized a peace concertin a Valletta Hall and promised a rally for Sunday if and when theweather improved.</TEXT></DOC>
