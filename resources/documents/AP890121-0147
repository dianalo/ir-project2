The failure occurred aboard GOES-6, a National Oceanographic andAtmospheric Administration satellite that was launched in April1983, said Milton Mortman, a shift supervisor at the agency'ssatellite operations control center.   ``It's just old age,'' Mortman said.   National Weather Service meteorologist Al Brown said weathermap-making would be little affected.   ``For making maps it wouldn't have that much effect,'' Brownsaid, noting that forecasters rely mostly on conventional grounddata.   ``We do things such as help them locate frontal positions ...coming in over the ocean areas. It's sort of extra input,'' he saidof the GOES-6 data.   Brown said partial pictures can be provided from a companionsatellite, GOES-7, that covers the Eastern United States.   ``We'll be getting pictures from the eastern satellite.Eventually we will move the eastern satellite over so it can coverthe entire country,'' Brown said.   Mortman said the process of moving GOES-7, using small rocketsmounted to the satellite, would be completed around Feb. 21.Controllers will move the GOES-7 satellite from its present positionat 80 degrees west longitude over northern South America to 108degrees west longitude.   GOES-6 is located at 134.5 west longitude, far out over thePacific Ocean. The two satellites are in stationary orbits 22,300miles above the equator.   Until the satellite is moved, weather-watching also will beaugmented by other existing satellites operated by NOAA and bysatellites from the European and Japanese space agencies, saidThomas N. Pyke Jr., NOAA's assistant administrator for satellite andinformation services.   NOAA said GOES-7 will perform double duty for an estimated 18months until mid-1990, when the next GOES satellite is expected tobe ready for launch.   Mortman said the satellites take cloud-cover pictures in narrowstrips and then compile the pieces to give large-scale, moving viewsof cloud patterns. An encoder lamp that is critical to thecompilation process failed, he said.   ``Without the lamp you have no instrument,'' Mortman said.</TEXT></DOC>
