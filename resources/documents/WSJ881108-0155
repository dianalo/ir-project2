People handling megamergers at companies are most likely to go.    Corporate staff executives dealing with details of today's multibillion-dollar mergers are most vulnerable to losing their jobs if the consolidations go through, say outplacement specialists and recruiters who have watched this all before. Companies don't need two sets of legal, tax, finance, merger-and-acquisition and public-relations sections, says C. Boardman Thompson II of Right Associates. Department heads particularly ought to &quot;start looking,&quot; David Smith of Korn/Ferry International concurs.    In most instances, executives at the absorbed companies are the merger casualties, says Steven Potter of Russell Reynolds Associates. Acquiring companies feel more comfortable with -- and want to keep -- the staffers they know. But sometimes, he cautions, it's an executive at the buying company who's asked to leave.    Managers know the risks. Recruiters say they're already getting resumes from executives at merger candidates.    PART-TIME WORK: Americans aren't alone in pushing the trend.    Foreign employers are using part-timers even more aggressively than U.S. companies to trim fixed costs, says Richard Belous, a labor economist with the National Planning Association. While part-time workers accounted for 17% of total employment in the U.S. in 1986, they represented 21% of the workers in Britain and 28% in Norway. Even in Japan, where lifetime employment had been a norm, part-time work is growing faster than in the U.S.    To Mr. Belous, the growth suggests American companies can't expect to gain a competitive edge in the world market by hiring more contingent workers. And other nations with &quot;more advanced social welfare systems,&quot; he says, may be better equipped to cope with the problems posed by large numbers of part-timers who often don't have the benefits that full-timers earn.    FAST-TRACKERS FIGHT for jobs overseas. Or do they?    Schering-Plough Corp. says high-potential executives want to work in foreign units because it gives them a chance to &quot;broaden and develop themselves for managerial positions&quot; at the parent. Johnson Controls Inc. asserts &quot;the interest in working overseas probably exceeds the opportunity for work over there.&quot; General Motors Corp. points to success stories following foreign tours: Three of the company's 18 top executives and two of five general managers served abroad before moving up at home.    But Tom Hardy, an executive recruiter at SpencerStuart, offers a different perspective. &quot;We have trouble getting fast-trackers to go overseas,&quot; he says. Objections run from worries about the financial burden to concern that a spouse will be unable to find a job. But mostly, managers are afraid they'll be forgotten overseas. ConAgra Inc. agrees it had to convince an executive in Brazil he wasn't going to be ignored.    Mr. Hardy advises transferred executives to have &quot;godfathers&quot; at headquarters to keep their names out front.    IGNORANCE IS BLISS, or so it goes with new tax code Section 89 tests of whether company health and life-insurance plans discriminate in favor of highly compensated executives. Consultant A. Foster Higgins says that two-thirds of the companies that haven't done any testing are confident they'll pass. Among companies that have done preliminary work, only 56% are sure.    GETTING FIRED? Chief executives in Japan receive more than 2 1/2 times their annual cash compensation when they're ousted from their jobs, consultant Towers Perrin says. They get at least two-years pay in the Netherlands, Belgium and West Germany. In the U.S., by contrast, fired CEOs get 41 weeks' pay.    WORKERS IN 21 STATES -- including California, New York and Texas -- are legally entitled to time off with pay to vote today, Commerce Clearing House says. Laws in 10 other states require time off, but either say pay isn't required or ignore the issue.    HOW MUCH is a manager worth? CPAs Coopers andamp; Lybrand says companies adjudged to be well-managed generally pay supervisors 15% more than the highest-paid employees reporting to them.    FLEXIBLE SCHEDULES spread as firms help workers balance family, job.    International Business Machines Corp. lets employees take longer leaves and permits some on leave to work part time at home. Equifax Inc. allows workers who crunch numbers into data banks to put in their 7 1/2 hours anytime between 7:30 a.m. and 9:30 p.m. U S West permits its workers to set any schedule they want that gets supervisor approval; it lets some employees toil at home and phone in their work.    But, with family patterns what they are, flexibility sometimes takes on the appearance of a woman's perk. National Semiconductor Corp., for instance, says some females at its factories opt for the graveyard shift so they can be at home with their children during the day. Their husbands keep the day hours and baby-sit at night.    Companies insist flexibility doesn't hurt careers. &quot;We wouldn't offer it if it did,&quot; U S West says.    THE CHECKOFF: University of Washington researchers say disability claims for lower-back pain rise or fall with the local jobless rate. . . . New York custom tailor Claude Barchi says sales often climb during economic slumps because out-of-work executives want new suits to hunt for jobs. </TEXT></DOC>
