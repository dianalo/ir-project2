The fired security chief, Mustafa Dirani, also criticized theAmal militia for arresting Shiite radicals in its search for Lt.Col. William R. Higgins.   Also Friday, there was a claim of responsibility for thekidnapping of two Scandinavian U.N. relief workers in a notedelivered to a Western news agency in west Beirut.   The handwritten Arabic note bore the victims' signatures,fingerprints and handwritten lines in English purportedly from thecaptives that said they were in good health.   It said the two would be freed when their ``interrogation'' iscomplete.   Amal, which has been searching for Higgins since his abductionin southern Lebanon by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists Feb.17, said in a statement Friday that Dirani was ``relieved of hisresponsibility as head of the central security system.'' It did notelaborate.   Higgins, 43, commanded a 76-member truce observer group from 16nations attached to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, known asUNIFIL.   Dirani said in a statement of his own that NATO paid Higgins andsome officials of the 5,800-man UNIFIL force to gather informationabout terrorists.   ``Regarding the American officer, I would like to stress that wehave confirmed information that NATO is seeking to confront what itcalls terrorism ... by forming security systems specializing inLebanon to gather information in preparation for acts of piracy inthe future,'' Dirani said in the statement, which did not mentionhis dismissal.   His accusations echoed claims by the kidnappers, a group callingitself the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, that Higgins isa CIA spy.   Dirani, a former master sergeant in the Lebanese army,criticized Amal for detaining members of Hezbollah, which is alliedwith Iran and is challenging Amal for supremacy in predominantlyShiite south Lebanon.   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is believed to be the umbrella forgroups holding most of the 25 foreigners missing in Lebanon.   U.S. officials denied Higgins was a spy and U.N. spokesman TimurGoksel said Friday that Dirani's allegations were baseless.   ``All UNIFIL personnel report directly to UNIFIL headquartersand to nowhere else,'' he said.   Higgins, from Danville, Ky., once was an aide to former U.S.Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. He was seized near theancient port of Tyre, an Amal stronghold 50 miles south of Beirut.   He is the ninth American among the missing foreigners. Thehostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, abducted March 16, 1985.   A group identifying itself as Revolutionary Cells claimedresponsibility for kidnapping two Scandinavian officials of theU.N. Relief and Works Agency on Feb. 5. The group's motives andaffiliations were not known.   In the note it released Friday, the group said it would free JanStening, 44, of Sweden, and William Jorgenson, 58, of Norway, oncetheir ``interrogation'' is completed.   ``I am in good health and I hope that I will be released soon,''Stening purportedly wrote on the note.   ``I am in good health and am eating good. Also I hope to bereleased very soon,'' Jorgensen wrote.   Stening and Jorgensen were seized near the Ein el-Hilewehrefugee camp on the outskirts of the southern port of Sidon.   Marrack Goulding, the U.N. undersecretary-general for politicalaffairs, said secret contacts were under way with ``people whomight have influence'' on the abductors to win the release of thecaptives.   The U.N. Relief and Works Agency supplies medical help,schooling and food to Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and theIsraeli-occupied territories.</TEXT></DOC>
