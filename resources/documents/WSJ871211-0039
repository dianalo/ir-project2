The Armonk, N.Y., computer giant, for its part, said it's pleased with the initial reaction to the machine, which it has been shipping in volume since September. The 9370 represents IBM's attempt to beat back the challenge posed by Digital Equipment Corp. in the market for minicomputers. And consultants agree that the machine has the potential to be a success over the long term.    Still, consultants say the 9370 has been far slower to catch on than they expected, and they have been busy in recent days scaling back their estimates of sales. They generally expect less than 4,000 of the $100,000-plus systems to be sold this year, down from expectations earlier in the year of as many as 8,000 and below IBM's forecast of about 5,000. The consultants have also cut expectations for sales of the 9370 next year to about 14,000 from 20,000.    That will undercut some of the more optimistic earnings estimates, which had assumed the 9370 would kick in during the second half of this year and support a strong turnaround by IBM that would extend through 1988 and beyond.    One of the big problems is that customers still find the 9370 to be too difficult to use. The machine is designed to be used in small businesses or in departments of big businesses, so it can't require a dedicated computer staff. Yet it takes several hours to install just the operating system, the base level of software the machines require to operate.    Richard Stuckey, a partner in the technical services organization at Arthur Andersen andamp; Co., said several of his clients who are evaluating the 9370 &quot;haven't rejected it at this point. But they've certainly found it more difficult to use than they had hoped.&quot;    Consultants also say it's too difficult to link the 9370 with other computers, especially personal computers. They say that because it's a new system, there aren't yet enough software applications packages that will run on it. And some say the operating system is so big that it can devour the resources of the smaller models of the 9370, making them operate more slowly than users would like.    The consultants say that IBM has begun to address the problems and that the pieces could fall into place over the next 12 to 18 months. They say the machine is too important for IBM to let it fall by the wayside because the system represents IBM's attempt to smooth communications between its minicomputers and mainframes and to allow for easier movement of software applications from one size system to another. Digital Equipment's ability to offer that sort of easy movement has been largely responsible for its successes at IBM's expense.    &quot;I don't want to sound alarmist, but this is the most important product from IBM in the past five years,&quot; said Mr. Colony of Forrester Research. &quot;My belief is that they'll continue to fix it.&quot;    Larry Ford, assistant group executive of midrange systems at IBM, said momentum is already building behind the machine. He said that hundreds of software applications have been reworked so they will run on the 9370 and that dozens of computer resellers are signing up to sell 9370s as part of systems they put together for their customers.    In addition, he said communications software and a new version of the operating system that will be shipped next year will address whatever big concerns users have about ease of use and communications between computers.    He acknowledged that the 9370 needs to have more software applications developed for it. He also cautioned that interest among customers will develop incrementally because the 9370 is designed for new types of applications and for people who weren't necessarily IBM customers before.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, IBM closed at $111 a share, down $3.    Myron Kerstetter, an analyst at Gartner Securities Corp., a Stamford, Conn., research firm, said the outstanding question is what IBM's competitors will accomplish in the year or more he figures it will take for IBM to get its act together.    &quot;Digital is still knocking at the door,&quot; he said. &quot;If it (Digital) can break down some barriers -- and I think some of that will happen -- then the optimism we feel for the 1989 timeframe starts to diminish. No question about it.&quot;    ---   IBM Sells Rest of Intel Stake   ARMONK, N.Y. -- International Business Machines Corp., as expected, sold its remaining 3.1 million shares of Intel Corp., the Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor maker.    IBM, which has been selling its holdings in Intel over the past 1 1/2 years, had said it would set aside its final 7.8 million shares to satisfy provisions of a February 1986 offering of Eurobonds. The offering allowed holders to exchange the bonds for that many Intel shares.    IBM called the Eurobonds for redemption by Nov. 10, and holders of 3.1 million of them chose cash rather than the stock, so IBM sold the remaining shares on the open market yesterday.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Intel closed at $24 a share, down $1.50 on volume of more than 9.5 million shares. </TEXT></DOC>
