In freewheeling banter with local and foreign reporters at aCairo news conference Thursday, Arafat called the Israelis his``cousins'' and said Israel's crackdown on the Palestinian uprisingviolates Jewish religious teaching.   Arafat asked the Israeli press to convey to their leaders andpeople his ``invitation'' to withdraw from the occupied territories,then join him in a dialogue and a peace treaty.   ``I want you to carry this invitation to all Israeli people andto all Israeli officials, and I want to have an answer and aresponse to what I said,'' he told the journalists.   The Israelis refuse to negotiate with the Palestine LiberationOrganization, which they denounce as a terrorist group.   Arafat arrived in Egypt earlier Thursday to meet with PresidentHosni Mubarak on the Egyptian leader's 10 suggested changes in anIsraeli plan.   The Israeli plan calls for Palestinian elections leading tonegotiations between Israel and representatives of the occupied WestBank and Gaza Strip on limited autonomy.   In an effort to overcome Arab objections, Mubarak has proposedbasing negotiations on the land-for-peace principle and letting the140,000 Arabs in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem vote in thePalestinian elections.   However, he has not demanded an explicit PLO role in representingthe territories and has not called for the creation of a Palestinianstate.   Arafat said the PLO had not taken a position on Mubarak'ssuggestions.   ``All these subjects are still under discussion, and there is aneffort by Mubarak and by other friends to reach an overall solutionto all these questions,'' Arafat said.   In recent days, Mubarak has been trying to sell Israelis on hisproposals through a media blitz. In radio and newspaper interviews,he has appealed to Israeli citizens to challenge their government'srefusal to negotiate with the PLO.   In Israel, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing Likudbloc told high school students in Tel Aviv he thought the Egyptianleader was ``only kidding around'' by his appeals.   ``I think that our people rely on the government,'' Shamir said.``We are a democratic country. If the people didn't rely on thegovernment, it wouldn't stand. It's not like in Egypt.''   However, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the left-of-centerLabor Party praised Mubarak's efforts and rejected right-wingcriticism of Mubarak's appeals.   Labor, which is Likud's governing coalition partner, has endorsedMubarak's plan. Rabin said Thursday, ``We are prepared for adialogue with a Palestinian delegation that is arranged by Egyptwith our agreement.''   Arafat remained cool and jovial when addressing Israelireporters, but he showed anger in talking about the Israeli army'scrackdown on the Palestinian uprising.   ``The main question is the daily killing of our children, ourwomen, our men. Isn't this wrong?'' he asked. ``These are ourchildren. Is this the teaching of the Torah? You are violating theTorah,'' he said, referring to the Jewish religious scriptures.   He claimed the Israelis have killed 932 Palestinians since theuprising began in December 1987.   Associated Press records, which are based on U.N., Israeli andArab sources, indicate 573 Palestinian have died.</TEXT></DOC>
