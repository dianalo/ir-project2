FAC 84-39, Items III, V, VIII, and IX The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354) does not apply becauseeach revision is not a ``significant revision'' as defined in FAR 1.501-1;i.e., it does not alter the substantive meaning of any coverage in theFAR having a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors orofferors, or a significant effect beyond the internal operating proceduresof the issuing agencies. Accordingly, and consistent with section 1212of Pub. L. 98-525 and section 302 of Pub. L. 98-577 pertaining to publicationof proposed regulations (as implemented in FAR Subpart 1.5, Agency andPublic Participation), solicitation of agency and public views on the revisionsis not required. Since such solicitation is not required, the RegulatoryFlexibility Act does not apply. FAC 84-39, Item IV The interim rule published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on August 30, 1985 (50 FR 35474) contained anInitial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.

FAC 84-39, Item VIDoD, GSA, and NASA certify that the final rule will not have a significanteconomic impact upon a substantial number of small entities within themeaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq., </T3>because its application is limited to cost-reimbursementcontracts of a limited number of agencies performed within a single state.The majority of contracts awarded to small businesses are fixed price.FAC 84-39, Item VII DoD, GSA, and NASA certify that this rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq.</T3>) because removal of the last sentence of section 31.205-6(g)(2)(i)results in no additional burden to any business and, in fact, eliminatesa limitation on cost allowability. Furthermore, situations involving dualretirement and severance payments have not been frequently encountered.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Public Comments </ITAG>FAC 84-39, Item I On February 27, 1987, Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 84-24 was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 6120) as an interim rule. The commentsthat were received were considered by the Civilian Agency Acquisition Counciland the Defense Acquisition Regulatory Council in the development of thisfinal rule.<T3>FAC 84-39, Item II</T3>On January 4, 1988, a proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 100). The comments that were receivedwere considered by the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the DefenseAcquisition Regulatory Council in the development of this final rule.FAC 84-39, Item IVOn August 30, 1985, FAC 84-11 was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(50 FR 35474) as an interim rule to implementcertain provisions of Pub. L. 98-525 and Pub. L. 98-577. Item III of theFAC implemented those provisions of the public laws related to ``qualificationrequirements.'' After reviewing the public comments on the interim rulethe Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition RegulatoryCouncil made revisions to the coverage. The FAR Councils issued for publiccomment on February 9, 1987 (52 FR 4082), revisions to Parts 9 and 52 tomodify the definition of ``qualification requirement'' at andSection; 9.201and as used in the clause at andSection; 52.209-1, as well as revisions tothe policy in andSection; 9.202. The FAR Councils have considered those publiccomments in the development of this final rule.FAC 84-39, Item VIOn September 24, 1987, a proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 35996) soliciting public comments on theRegulatory Flexibility Statement that there did not appear to be a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities. No comments were receivedregarding that statement. No commenters expressed opposition to the proposedFAR coverage. One commenter's suggestion, that the source of the definitionof the word ``services'' used in the coverage be placed in the coverage,was adopted.FAC 84-39, Item VIIOn September 17, 1987, a proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 35191) recommending the removal of thelast sentence of FAR 31.205-6(g)(2)(i) which disallowed severance paymentswhen paid in addition to early or normal retirement payments.

The Act was passed to detersubcontractors from making payments and contractors from accepting paymentsfor the purpose of improperly obtaining or rewarding favorable treatmentin connection with a prime contract or a subcontract relating to a primecontract. The Act requires each contracting agency to include in all contractsa requirement that the contractor shall (a) have in place and follow reasonableprocedures designed to prevent and detect violations of the Act, and (b)cooperate with any Federal agency investigating a violation of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Item II_Acquisition Streamlining</ITAG>The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition RegulatoryCouncil have approved changes to FAR Parts 7 and 10 to institutionalizethe implementation of acquisition streamlining.<ITAG tagnum="84">Item III_Walsh-Healey Eligibility Determination</ITAG>FAR 9.104-3(a) is being revised to eliminate redundant portions of textalready stated in FAR 22.608-2.<ITAG tagnum="84">Item IV_Qualification Requirements</ITAG>Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 84-11 was issued as an interim ruleon August 30, 1985, to implement certain provisions of Pub. L. 98-525 andPub. L. 98-577 related to ``qualification requirements'' and imposed newprocedural obligations on Federal agencies before they could require testingor other quality assurance demonstration as a condition to award of a Governmentcontract.Public comments raised two significant problems. First, the interim ruleappears to have defined ``qualification requirements'' too broadly, inthat the rule appears to imply that it covers industry specifications andrestrictions which the Government has neither approved nor endorsed. Second,the interim rule may have applied the new policies concerning ``qualificationrequirements'' too narrowly, in that the rule treats components of enditems differently from the specific supplies or services actually purchasedon a Government prime contract.As a result of these comments, a proposed rule was issued that would modifyFAR 9.206-1(d) and the clause at 52.209-1 to require that any qualificationrequirements applicable to a component be met before award of a prime contract,whether the contractor intends to purchase or manufacture the component.The proposed rule would have deleted the clause at 52.209-2 as no longernecessary.Having considered all public comments received on the proposed rule, theFAR Councils have developed this final rule coverage. Changes have beenmade strictly for the purpose of clarification and involve no substantivechanges. They are as follows:a. The first sentence of subsection 52.209-1 has been rewritten to clarifythe concept that a product or service must be qualified whether it willbe provided by the contractor or a subcontractor. FAR 9.207(a)(3) is editoriallyrevised to reflect removal of the clause at 52.207-2.b. FAR 9.202(a)(1)(ii) is changed to indicate that the testing and evaluationcosts referenced are those of a potential offeror.<ITAG tagnum="84">Item V_Small Business Size Standards</ITAG>FAR 19.102 is revised to incorporate changes made to the size standardsregulations as published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> by the Small Business Administration on May 25,1988. The modified size standard, SIC Code 4724, published in 53 FR 18820(FR Doc. 88-11693) applies to solicitations issued on or after June 24,1988. SIC Code 8731 is effective March 30, 1988, by issuance of an SBAemergency interim rule (53 FR 10244). Modified size standards, SIC Codes3339, 3569, 3996, 5735, and 7361, published in 53 FR 18821 (FR Doc. 88-11694)apply to solicitations issued on or after July 1, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="85">Item VI_State of New Mexico Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax</ITAG>Nine Federal agencies have entered into separate agreements with the Taxationand Revenue Department of the State of New Mexico to eliminate double taxationof Government cost-reimbursable contractors who purchase tangible personalproperty to be used in performing services, title to which passes to theUnited States upon delivery of the property to the contractor by the vendor.The agreement is effective only when the clause at FAR 52.229-10, Stateof New Mexico Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax, is included in eachcost-reimbursement contract for the following Federal agencies:<ITAG tagnum="15">United States Department of Agriculture</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">United States Department of the Air Force</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">United States Department of the Army</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">United States Department of Energy</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">United States Department of the Interior</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">United States Department of Labor</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">United States Department of the Navy</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">United States General Services Administration </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ITAG>Failure to include the clause in each cost-reimbursement contract meansthe Government reimburses the contractor the gross receipts tax paid toa vendor for purchased tangible personal property and reimburses the contractorfor its own gross receipts tax which includes the tax already paid on purchasedproperty (double taxation).The coverage in FAR 29.401-6 encourages other agencies which expect toenter into cost-reimbursement contracts in the State of New Mexico to executesimilar agreements with the New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department.<ITAG tagnum="84">Item VII_Severance Pay</ITAG>FAR 31.205(g)(2)(i) is being revised to delete the provision disallowingseverance payments which are in addition to early or normal retirementpayments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Item VIII_Price Negotiation for Construction Contracts</ITAG>FAR 36.402(b) is being revised to clarify when certified cost or pricingdata is required in connection with negotiated construction contracts.<ITAG tagnum="84">Item IX_F.O.B.
