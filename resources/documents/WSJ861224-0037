But Dana contends that the old contract doesn't provide for pay for the 1986 Christmas-New Year's shutdown.    &quot;The old contract refers to holidays by specific dates,&quot; said a Dana spokesman. &quot;In other words, it doesn't say Christmas or New Year's. It says Dec. 25, 1985, or Dec. 26, 1985.&quot; He added, &quot;We have no basis for making the holiday pay at all.&quot;    But UAW secretary-treasurer Ray Majerus, in a prepared statement, said workers have traditionally gotten holiday pay. He said the UAW has asked the company to reconsider, and that the union will take &quot;appropriate actions&quot; if the company goes ahead with its decision. Mr. Majerus didn't elaborate. The Dana spokesman said any agreement on holiday pay would have to come in a new master contract. Negotiations are scheduled to resume Jan. 7.    Dana said 3,200 workers in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania and Illinois were affected. The UAW statement put the total at 6,000 workers, and a spokesman couldn't be reached to explain the discrepancy.    Each of the plants in question have varying schedules, but they will be shut down for about eight days at the end of this month, the Dana spokesman said. The hourly workers make an average of about $13 an hour, he added, so the average worker will lose about $832. </TEXT></DOC>
