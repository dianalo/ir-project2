The storied rivalry between Silicon Valley's laid-backcomputer wizards and the buttoned-down businessmen ofBoston's flagging Route 128 region was reflected Friday inthe second annual Computer Bowl. The Boston Computer Museumbenefit, modeled after the College Bowl game show, featuredan all-star cast including William H. Gates, reformed hackerand billionaire chairman of Microsoft Corp., and MitchellKapor, trivia whiz and founder of Lotus Development Corp.</LP><TEXT>   The East Coast team, captained by Patrick J. McGovern,chairman of International Data Corp., maintained a slim leadthrough much of the contest, fielding the most obscurecomputer-trivia questions. Bob Frankston, co-developer of thefirst electronic spreadsheet and chief scientist at Lotus,was the East's Most Valuable Player.   The rapid-fire questions ranged from real softballs(E-PROM, as any nerd knows, is an erasable-programmableread-only memory) to the truly arcane (Q: What's the ASCIIequivalent for the `escape' key? A: 27). Mr. Frankston, cladin the dark business suit that was the uniform of the East,knew that one. The West wore shirt-sleeves.   The West's big gun, Mr. Gates, didn't turn out to be muchof a factor, though he delivered in a couple of clutchsituations. He was hot in a warm-up round before the Bowl --to be broadcast nationwide on PBS's Computer Chronicles inMay -- but the East took the preliminary. There was somespeculation that the warm-up loss was a set-up by the wilyMr. Gates, and someone from Microsoft was indeed seen takingbets.   It was a bitter defeat for the East. It's bad enough thatthe momentum in the industry has shifted to the West andsmaller, more nimble machines, leaving Eastern firmsbleeding. This was personal.   After trailing most of the game, the West seized the leadin the fourth quarter. The East tied the score in the finalseconds, but the West won at the buzzer. The coveted silverComputer Bowl was handed over to the Californians. &quot;Thedefeat of unknown nerds from failing East Coast companies wasinevitable,&quot; said West Coast captain and venture capitalistL. John Doerr, who couldn't resist rubbing it in.</TEXT></DOC>
