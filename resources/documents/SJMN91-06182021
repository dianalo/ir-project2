And there's strong evidence that investors can follow theirconscience and at the same time make money.;    &quot;Not only does it make iteasier to look in the mirror and know that when I spend the money it's beenused well more than once,&quot; says social investor Peter deFur, 41, a scientistwith the Environmental Defense Fund in Richmond, Va. &quot;But it also means that Iknow I'm a small part of the sum that will eventually make the difference.&quot;;   What began in the 1920s with ministers intent on avoiding &quot;sin stocks&quot; ofcompanies linked with alcohol, gambling and tobacco has reached a record $625billion investment, according to the Social Investment Forum, a St. Paul,Minn.-based trade association of socially conscious investment professionalsand investors.;    Investors who reflect the rainbow of today's social andpolitical beliefs are deliberately backing everything from yuppie ice creamcompanies to waste recyclers, while consciously avoiding firms that make birthcontrol pills, cigarettes or do business in South Africa.;    Examples offirms on the outs with social investors: General Electric for making weaponsand nuclear power equipment and using birds to test jet engines, and AmericanHome Products for selling infant formula in the Third World.;    A favoritestock: Maytag Corp., with a long history of encouraging employees to suggestnew products and strategies and a good environmental reputation for developingenergy-saving washing machines.;    &quot;The basic concept of social investing isdoing well while doing good, and making the world a better place through thecorporation,&quot; says Reed Gligorovic, product manager for the Calvert Group inBethesda, Md. The firm manages half of the dozen mutual funds that screencompanies through a range of social and ethical criteria that match investors'values with their bank accounts.;    Naysayers say much of this is nothingmore than New Age nuttiness. And critics doubt whether socially consciousinvestors can profit from their principles, especially over the long term.;   Companies targeted by social investors also dismiss their impact. The value ofGE stock has increased nearly fivefold in the last decade to $58 billiontoday, indicating &quot;the direction that investment decisions are moving,&quot; saysspokesman Bruce Bunch.;    And Carol Emerling, a spokeswoman for American HomeProducts Corp., says social investors are often misinformed about companypractices. &quot;Often they will jump on a bandwagon without investigating theissue,&quot; she says.;    What the movement really mirrors, social investorscounter, is a sincere '90s backlash against the me-too '80s, fueled largely byaging baby boomers concerned about the environment and the future.;    Socialinvesting came of age in the 1970s, as anti-Vietnam War sentiments led to thedevelopment of &quot;peace portfolios&quot; that excluded defense companies. In the1980s, the trend boomed with investor opposition to South Africa's apartheidpolicies. Today, environmentally friendly stocks are drawing socialinvestors.;    The explosive growth of the social investment market, saysbusiness ethics expert Kenneth Goodpaster, belongs to a larger phenomenon: thegrowing militancy of corporate &quot;stakeholders&quot; -- consumers, employees, localcommunities and shareholders -- &quot;to have their voice heard in the corporatedecision-making process.&quot;;    &quot;What we are really looking for is a capitalismwith a socially responsible conscience,&quot; says Goodpaster, business ethicsprofessor at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul.;    As proof of theirbottom-line soundness, social investment boosters point to consistentlyprofitable performance of leading socially conscious investment funds. Moneymagazine computed that of the five ethical mutual funds around since 1986,four beat the average returns for their fund categories.;    &quot;It works. Itmade money,&quot; agrees deFur, who says he has gotten an 18 percent return fromCalvert mutual funds over the last 15 months. Calvert does not invest in firmsinvolved in nuclear energy production or equipment, manufacturing weapons orthat do business in South Africa.;    Other studies agree. However, one studyconcluded that 10 socially conscious mutual funds showed &quot;sub-par&quot;performances from 1984 to 1988.;    But social investors are not just making areturn on their money, says Gary Moore, a Paine Webber stockbroker who haswritten &quot;The Thoughtful Christian's Guide to Investing.&quot; They are &quot;makingdecisions that shape our society.&quot;;    Social investors say one need look nofurther than South Africa. Under intense pressure from activists, 40 percentof foreign-owned companies in South Africa withdrew their assets, contributingto a $12 billion exodus of net capital from the country since 1985, accordingto the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. In mid-June, the SouthAfrican parliament voted to repeal one of the last vestiges of apartheid, thelaw that classified its citizens by race.;    &quot;If there's no investment goingto South Africa until they change their social policies, they're either goingto go belly up or change. Basically, that's what's come about,&quot; says deFur.;   But South Africa also brings into question how much influence socialinvestors can claim they bring to bear on corporate decision makers.;   &quot;Despite mounting pressure from investors and customers and an unfavorablebusiness environment, a number of corporations still refuse to pull theirinvestments out of South Africa,&quot; conceded Donna Katzin, of the InterfaithCenter, a coalition of 250 Protestant and Catholic groups and investors.;   Charlotte Cuff, a spokeswoman for American Cyanamid, says, &quot;We listen&quot; toactivist shareholders who want the company to get out of South Africa. &quot;But wefeel very strongly that we're doing good by being there. Our (South African)employees are certainly better off . . . than if we weren't.&quot;;    Goodpasterbelieves social investing's greatest strength lies in the sizable chunkwielded by institutional investors such as church groups and unions,educational institutions and government officials controllingmultimillion-dollar pension funds. The Interfaith Center alone controls a $25billion portfolio.;    Operating on the one-share, one-vote system, theseinvestors lobby corporations through shareholder resolutions on social issues.More than 350 were introduced this year affecting nearly 200 companies.;   After federal trade officials helped Philip Morris and other U.S. cigarettecompanies win the right to export cigarettes to Japan and Southeast Asia,anti-smoking activists introduced a shareholder resolution to force thecompany to use America's tough health warning labels on all cigarettes soldworldwide.;    Philip Morris officials argued that they would continue tofollow the laws of individual countries. The resolution failed, as expected,says Timothy Smith, the interfaith center's executive director, but itgarnered publicity and access to corporate information that can be used tofurther their battles.;    Social investors such as Leon Frankel, a Wheaton,Ill., accountant who has a $50,000 investment with the Calvert Group, admittheir influence may be small. &quot;But it allows me to live with myself,&quot; Frankelsays.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CHRISTOPHER SCANLAN, Mercury News Washington Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910630  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,218  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday June 30, 199100182021,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
