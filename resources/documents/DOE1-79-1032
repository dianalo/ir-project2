Diagnosis is often complicated by the normal biochemicaland physiologic changes of gestation. Radiation risk to the fetus isan important concern when imaging is required to assist in diagnosis.Imaging with ultrasound is the primary and often the only modality requiredfor diagnosis of many pregnancy-associated diseases. When x-rays areunavoidable, the fetus can be shielded externally from direct but notfrom scatter radiation. When imaging with radioactive agents is required,nuclides with very short half-lives are used to minimize dosage. Becauseof the risk of inducing fetal cretinism, radioactive iodine studies arecontraindicated in pregnancy. Computed tomography scanning of the maternalhead for neurologic complications carried essentially no risk to thedeveloping fetus.</TEXT></DOC>
