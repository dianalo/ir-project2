That's what incredulous investors are asking as they watchyields on money-market mutual funds sink week by week, to thelowest levels in almost two decades.</LP><TEXT>   And, at a time when investors have already started pullingbillions of dollars out of money funds to seek higher returnsin the stock market and other investments, the answer isn'tlikely to make anybody happy.   &quot;Investors could see yields . . . approximating 3.25%before too long,&quot; says Edward A. Wiese, manager of T. RowePrice Associates' $4.2 billion Prime Reserve money fund.   Yields on money-market mutual funds are now at the lowestpoint ever experienced by most individual investors. Theaverage seven-day compound yield, which assumes reinvestmentof dividends, stood at 4.61% at the end of 1991, according toIBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report.   Yields were lower in the early 1970s, but detailedcomparisons aren't possible because industry records don't goback that far; there were only a few funds at the time, usedmostly by institutional investors. In October 1975, whenDonoghue's started tracking money-fund yields and assets, itlisted just 28 funds with $3.6 billion in assets. Yields wereabout 6%; they dropped below 5% in August 1977.   Today, money funds are a central part of the financiallives of millions of American families. Money Fund Report nowlists 521 taxable funds, with total assets of more than $450billion.   The average yield for the fourth quarter of 1991 was4.75%, as estimated by Donoghue's. That's about half apercentage point lower than the third quarter and about 2 1/2percentage points below the average for the fourth quarter of1990. &quot;It's not a very satisfying picture for money fundinvestors,&quot; says Walter Frank, chief economist for theAshland, Mass., newsletter.   Although total assets are a bit higher than at the end ofthe third quarter, assets of funds open to individualinvestors have fallen by about $10 billion, to $324.6billion, a 3% decline. (Institutional investors account forthe difference.)   The outflow is likely to continue as yields declinefurther, but industry officials say they don't expect awholesale run. &quot;It's like taking money out of a savings bankto put it into the stock and bond markets,&quot; says John C.Bogle, chairman of Vanguard Group. &quot;A lot of people justaren't going to do that, no matter what.&quot;   Money funds usually are considered among the safestinvestments because they are structured so that the yieldvaries but the principal value remains the same.   Still, even mutual fund executives are recommending thatinvestors take some cash out of money funds. &quot;The issue isn'tshould I do this or that,&quot; Mr. Bogle says. &quot;The real issue isshould I do this and that.&quot;   The fund companies themselves are promoting a variety ofhigher-yielding alternatives that they hope will keepinvestors from shifting funds elsewhere.   Among the most popular with investors have been funds thatinvest in short-term government securities, which offerhigher yields than money funds, but with only a smallincrease in risk. Fidelity Investments' Spartan LimitedMaturity Government Fund, for instance, has grown to $2.1billion from $162 million at the start of last year. Itinvests in Treasury and government agency securities maturingin 10 years or less.   Some of the cash coming out of money funds clearly hasgone into the stock market, which reached record highs in thelast days of 1991. The Investment Company Institute, themutual funds trade group, reported that almost $3.5 billionpoured into stock funds in November alone, and fund companiessay the pace of sales picked up sharply in December.   Money-market funds generally are limited to securitiesthat mature in one year or less. For most of the fourthquarter, average maturity of the funds tracked by Donoghue'sremained at more than 60 days, which is fairly long by moneyfund standards. The longer maturities reflect an attempt totake advantage of a fairly steep yield curve, with evenslightly longer-term securities yielding more than many veryshort-term investments. The maximum average maturity formoney funds permitted by Securities and Exchange Commissionregulations is 90 days.   Money fund managers expect yields in the 3.25% to 3.50%range within about two months, reflecting the 59-day averagematurity of taxable funds. They base their calculations onthe current three-month Treasury bill yield of about 4%, lessthe money funds' expenses charged to investors. Thoseexpenses, expressed as a percentage of assets, currentlyaverage 0.62%, according to Donoghue's.   The highest-yielding fund for both the fourth quarter andthe 12 months was the $171 million Riverside Capital MoneyMarket Fund, which is distributed by Winsbury Co. inColumbus, Ohio. Its 7.19% yield for the fourth quarter wasabout 1.5 percentage points higher than the quarter's No. 2fund, Alger Money Market Portfolio.   The Riverside Capital fund's yield included a capital gainfrom the sale of securities at a premium, although it wouldhave been among the highest-yielding funds even without thegain, Donoghue's said. Because of the way money funds arestructured, capital gains and losses are reflected in theyield rather than in the net asset value of the shares. Fourof the top 10 funds for the quarter and five of the top fundsfor the 12 months realized capital gains.   Six of the top 10 funds for the quarter, and all theyear's top 10, waived all or a portion of their managementcharges, which has the effect of boosting yield. But fundofficials say that it's unlikely that funds that have beengradually introducing fees over the past year or so willreverse course. &quot;There just isn't enough leverage inmoney-fund expenses&quot; to make a difference in people'sinvestment decisions, says Neal Litvack, marketing vicepresident for Fidelity.   Instead, industry officials say, fund companies will beemphasizing alternatives to money funds to keep assets withina fund family. Indeed, some fund groups have created suchalternatives in recent months. Benham Capital ManagementGroup, for instance, began an adjustable-rate mortgage fundin September that already has $443 million in assets. T. RowePrice Associates' adjustable-rate government fund, whichstarted in October, has $104 million in assets.   These funds invest in securities issued by governmentagencies that are backed by adjustable-rate mortgages. Theiryields are typically higher than money funds, but because theinterest rates on the mortgages vary, there is lessfluctuation in the price of the underlying securities.   Most money-fund investors should probably avoid long-termbond funds, fund officials say. Those funds offersignificantly higher yields -- but with significantly morerisk of price fluctuations.   &quot;Greed sometimes overrides the mind,&quot; says James M.Benham, chairman of Benham Capital Management. &quot;Some peopleare going to get their hands burned.&quot;   ---                Monitoring Money-Market Funds                                                                                                          A look at consumer-oriented money funds and some of theirholdings at the end of the fourth quarter.
