The February contract of West Texas Intermediate, the leadinggrade of U.S. crude oil, went up 45 cents to $22.07 per 42-gallonbarrel after falling $1.46 on Monday. Other delivery months alsoended higher.   Andrew Lebow, a senior broker and analyst at E.D.andamp;F. ManInternational Futures Inc., said the rebound came as a sort ofreflex action after the big three-day sell-off sparked by warmerweather and profit-taking.   ``It seemed to be a good old-fashioned short-covering rallyafter the steep declines we've seen in recent days,'' he said.   Short covering involves buying back a commodity that previouslyhas been sold.</TEXT></DOC>
