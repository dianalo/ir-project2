Inc. and its parent, Anac Holding Corp., fileda plan of reorganization in an Akron, Ohio, federalbankruptcy court, nearly three years after the retailer firstentered bankruptcy-court protection.   Under the proposal, the drugstore chain's assets would bedistributed among creditors in the form of cash, notes andstock.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;A large portion of the value of the company is beingdistributed in the form of common equity in the reorganizedRevco,&quot; Gregory K. Raven, Revco executive vice president andchief financial officer, said in a statement. The plan &quot;will. . . allow Revco to emerge from bankruptcy with a manageablecapital structure.&quot;   The company, which, like its parent, is based inTwinsburg, Ohio, said it plans to file a disclosure statementsoon, and expects a hearing on the adequacy of the disclosurestatement to take place some time in August. Until thedisclosure statement is approved by the bankruptcy court,Revco officers may not solicit the approval of the plan fromcreditors.   Terms of the proposed reorganization are believed to beless favorable for bondholders than a plan proposed lastOctober. Since then, the company's operating results havedeteriorated. For the nine months ended Feb. 9, Revco had a$62.2 million loss on revenue of $1.3 billion, a 34% revenuedrop from the year earlier.   Revco was taken private in a $1.25 billion 1986 leveragedbuy-out. It was the first of a long list of highly leveragedfirms taken private in the 1980s and later forced to seekbankruptcy-court protection.   Following its mid-1988 bankruptcy-court filing, thecompany initiated a wave of lawsuits against formershareholders, investment advisers and lenders, claiming theyillegally lured it into the buy-out.   The company has since abandoned most claims againstshareholders, and under the proposed plan of reorganization,virtually all litigation outstanding will be settled. Theonly litigation outstanding not settled under the proposal isa cause of action by Revco parent Anac against SalomonBrothers, the company's former investment adviser. Revco paidWall Street and other advisers $86.9 million in fees relatedto the 1986 leveraged buy-out.   The company's 1988 bankruptcy-court filing did not end itscostly relationship with advisers. Through Feb. 1, thecompany has paid $40 million to accountants, lawyers andinvestment advisers.   Revco operates 1,100 drugstores in 10 eastern states.</TEXT></DOC>
