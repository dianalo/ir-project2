Despitethe very real progress that has been made, the routine performance ofsuperconducting cavities still falls far short of both the theoreticalexpectations and the performance of a few exception examples. It is thetask of systematically applied diagnostic techniques to reveal additionalinformation concerning the response of superconducting surfaces to appliedRF fields. Here recent developments in diagnostic techniques are discussed.18 references, 12 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
