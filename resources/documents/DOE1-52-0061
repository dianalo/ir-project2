Sun is leading the evolution ofthe computing environment towards advanced heterogeneous networking schemeswhere specialized compute facilities may be purchased from a number ofvendors and integrated onto a network. Whether it be transparent fileaccess or a distributed computing application, the user does not needspecialized network knowledge. From the organization's point of view,old equipment can finally be connected and new equipment integrated.NFS, an emerging industry standard, is a transparent file access servicefor constructing an integrated multi-vendor network. Over 80 organizationshave adopted NFS as their transparent file access service for networks.REX is a network tool for distributing discrete job steps in computing.REX uses NFS to transparently access files and duplicates the contentof the current working environment on a remote machine. With the growingsophistication of many types of applications (such as simulation andmodeling), very large shared machines can be coupled with workstationssuch that the batch process routine on a central compute server can beaccessed seemingly interactively from a workstation. An example is usinga high performance compute server to accelerate a power transmissionsimulation. A model is built on the workstation with interactive procedures.This same model can then be accessed by the mini supercomputer whichcrunches through the analysis. Display of the results are processed onthe workstation for subsequent interpretation. The promise of open systemscomputing and a networked homogeneous computing environment is a choiceof vendors for workstations and network servers.</TEXT></DOC>
