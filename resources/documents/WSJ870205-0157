Mr. Simpson is the president of Mead Data Central, a Mead Corp. unit whose computerized data bases contain millions of newspaper articles, legal documents and government research reports. During the last nine months, Mr. Simpson says, agents of the Air Force, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have dropped by. They all asked whether the company would disclose the identities of its 320,000 subscribers and block certain subscribers from using the data bases or, at least, tell the government which information those subscribers request.    &quot;They want the private sector to police the customers,&quot; he complains.    Mead, which turned down the requests, isn't alone. Other data-base companies have received similar federal inquiries, says Kenneth Allen, the senior vice president of the Information Industry Association, a Washington trade group. He calls it &quot;the Big Brother approach.&quot;    The Reagan administration wants to limit the U.S. scientific information available in commercial and government data bases, to keep it out of the hands of foreign competitors and adversaries. In related moves, the Defense Department has blocked U.S. scientists from delivering papers on government-funded research -- mostly on optics and composite materials -- in open sessions and has restricted the circulation of unclassified research that it deems &quot;sensitive.&quot;    The government fears that private data bases provide researchers who are potentially unfriendly to the U.S. with summaries of leading research in nuclear fusion, oil drilling, rocket-motor design, helicopter design and other militarily valuable subjects. Before these computerized information banks were created, such technical reports were scattered in hundreds of arcane journals and libraries. Now the data-base companies collect millions of documents and let customers comb through them in minutes by computer.    &quot;There are people who are not necessarily our friends -- and I don't mean just the Soviets -- who are making extensive use of data bases,&quot; says Donald Latham, the assistant secretary of defense for command, control, communications and intelligence. &quot;Our concern is technology loss.&quot;    Mr. Latham denies that the Pentagon has any plans to restrict data-base companies. &quot;I can just see the headlines: '1984 is here -- Defense Department monitors all private data bases,'&quot; he groans. But he says the government can limit what material is made available to data bases, by requiring researchers who get money from the Defense Department to obtain approval before publishing findings.    Stephen Bryen, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for trade-security policy, says the government can require that certain data be put only in government data bases that are open to U.S. defense contractors but closed to foreigners. &quot;Compartmentalizing is very effective&quot; at keeping the data in the right hands, he says.    But Dale Courson, the president emeritus of Cornell University, says such an approach amounts to &quot;shooting ourselves in the foot,&quot; because it also cuts off the flow of information to many U.S. engineers. For example, Marvin DeVries, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Wisconsin, says limiting information could have a &quot;detrimental effect&quot; on his work because he searches data bases to ensure he isn't duplicating any other scientist's efforts.    The government hasn't required data-base companies to take any action. Nevertheless, concerned about what action the government might take, Mead has begun policing itself.    By this summer, Mead plans to drop Energy Department reports and other research published by the government's National Technical Information Service, Mr. Simpson says. Without self-censorship, he fears, the Pentagon would first clamp down on that information, which includes summaries of militarily valuable research, and create a precedent for restricting access to Mead's general-interest Nexis data base. &quot;We've drawn the battle line,&quot; he says. &quot;With NTIS out of our system, we're saying, 'That's it.'&quot;    It is unclear how much legal authority the government has to restrict access to data bases or require data-base companies to turn over names of customers. But the Pentagon has broad authority under contract law and export-control laws to control the flow of technical information abroad. And government attempts to stem the flow of technical information have picked up steam recently as the Reagan administration has pushed for controls on information that it calls &quot;sensitive, but unclassified.&quot;    Last spring, says James Seals Jr., the marketing director of Chemical Abstracts Service of Columbus, Ohio, Air Force investigators asked if it would be feasible for him to use a new software program to remove &quot;sensitive&quot; information from the data base that his company provides customers. He dismissed the idea as &quot;wholly impractical,&quot; and precisely what data the government wanted to restrict was never made clear.    Last fall, the NTIS asked companies that carry the Energy Department data base to block customers that trade information with foreigners from using the energy reports. The service also asked the companies to disclose the names of users of the energy data base. Joseph Clark, the service's deputy director, says the agency made the request to help the Energy Department learn if contractors and employees were using the data base, as the department hoped they were. After the data-base companies objected, NTIS withdrew its proposal.    In late October, then-National Security Adviser John Poindexter released a definition of sensitive information that includes not only &quot;national security interests&quot; but also a &quot;wide range of government or government-derived economic, human, financial, industrial, agricultural (and) technological&quot; information.    Rep. Glenn English, an Oklahoma Democrat, warns that the government's definition of sensitive might include maps and telephone directories. And Mr. Seals of Chemical Abstracts frets that if the government tries to restrict U.S. data bases, foreign researchers may retaliate with an &quot;information boycott&quot; of U.S. information-service companies.    Federal agencies themselves appear divided about whether and how to restrict data bases. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, for instance, is liberalizing access to its data base of 2.5 million documents on aerospace research.    But another part of NASA maintains what it calls a &quot;no-no list&quot; of three dozen companies, largely data-base vendors, that the agency bars from obtaining research data, because it suspects them of exporting the information.    Currently, the list is little more than a headache to information-service companies. One banned company, Information/Documentation Inc. of Washington D.C., says NASA sends it information if the company promises not to ship it abroad. But company president Michael Saboe worries about NASA's power. &quot;Our lifeblood is providing information,&quot; he says. &quot;They could shut us off and put us out of business.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
