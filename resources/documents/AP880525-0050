(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson, on the eve ofPresident Reagan's departure for the superpower summit, called onthe president and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to look beyondmilitary solutions to the world's problems.   ``The president goes to Moscow, frustrated in Nicaragua. Thegeneral secretary receives him, defeated in Afghanistan,'' theDemocratic presidential contender told a World Affairs Councilluncheon here Tuesday. ``The most powerful nations of the worldconfounded in seeking to control poor small nations on or neartheir borders.''   ``After a certain point, there is less and less relationshipbetween military prowess and the ability to achieve politicalobjectives,'' Jackson told the group.   Reagan was leaving this morning for Helsinki, where he willremain until he flies to Moscow on Sunday for the start of the May29-June 2 summit.   Jackson said he would adopt a no-first-use policy on nuclearweapons and conduct talks with the Soviet Union on bilateralreductions of conventional forces in Europe.   And he called for U.S.-Soviet cooperation in tackling theproblems of hunger and poverty around the globe.   He noted Gorbachev's proposal that the superpowers work togetheron an exploration of Mars, and suggested that Reagan reciprocate``by suggesting a joint project to eradicate disease in the ThirdWorld.''   In his speech, Jackson also urged an end to the military buildupReagan has presided over.   ``After the largest military buildup in our history, we mustchange our course or lose our way,'' Jackson said. Earlier thisweek, he released a five-year budget plan that called for a freezein military spending.   ``Invest that money to educate our children, provide health careto our parents, and protect our environment. This is not an act ofcharity; it is a necessary part of defending our real security,''he said.   Later, Jackson appeared at an anti-apartheid rally outside theSouth African consulate. He repeated his call for South Africa tobe designated a terrorist state, and said he would urge that theproposal be made part of the Democratic Party platform.   ``We have a moral obligation to put South Africa in the loop ofterror, to free people from this tyranny and gain our moralauthority in this world,'' he said.   Jackson also hinted that his Democratic rival, front-runnerMichael Dukakis, has not taken a sufficient interest in the issue.   ``He is not very conversant on our options in South Africa,''Jackson said of the Massachusetts governor. ``When we talk about itin more detail, Mr. Dukakis will see it as a terrorist state.''</TEXT></DOC>
