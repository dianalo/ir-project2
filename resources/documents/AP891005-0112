(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The afternoon Kansas City Star and themorning Kansas City Times will merge to form a single morning papercalled The Kansas City Star.   No date was set for publication of the merged newspaper, saidJames H. Hale, publisher of the two papers.   He and Editor Joe McGuff said today that no employees will belaid off because of the merger.   The two papers have been owned by Capital Cities-ABC Inc. since1977 but compete in news coverage.   The merger will mark the end of 109 years of afternoonpublishing by the Kansas City Star Co., which was started in 1880as a two-penny, four-page paper by William Rockhill Nelson andSamuel E. Morss.   Nelson later bought Morss' interest and purchased the Times in1901 and ran it as the morning edition of the Star.   McGuff said the change was brought about by decliningcirculation and shifting readership preferences.   ``Readers are telling us they have less time for reading, forwatching television and for leisure activities than ever before,''McGuff said. ``They want their information in one convenient,well-organized, easy-to-read package.''   The decision to drop afternoon publication follows a trend amongmetropolitan newspapers around the country.   The 1989 Editor andamp; Publisher Yearbook gives the daily Timescirculation at 280,000, the Star's at 185,000. The Sunday Star'scirculation is a little more than 400,000.</TEXT></DOC>
