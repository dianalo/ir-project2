The state government of Hesse thinks peaceful utilizationof nuclear energy to be indispensable for reasons of ecology, profitabilityand safe energy supply for as long as energy demand will not be coveredby other types of energy generation involving less hazards. The stategovernment acknowledges coal and its contribution to the energy supplyof the Federal Republic of Germany, and advocates its application inelectric power generation. The government thinks that there are stillgreat potentials which can be developed economically for rational energyutilization and purposeful energy conservation. The state governmentviews the HTR as an important component in its long-term energy supplysystem. Renewable energies are expected to prove their value in the marketplace after an initial period of promotion. The situation of energy economywhich has eased for the time being, allows to renew the basic consensusbetween the parties in energy policy. The article is based on the papergiven by the Minister of State of the VDEW annual conference 'Stromversorgung1987' (Electric Power Supply 1987).</TEXT></DOC>
