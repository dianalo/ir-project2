They expect the protein to be introduced for some leukemiapatients this fall and for human transplant patients in a year orso. The leukemia patients suffer from a form of the disease markedby an excess of transplant-attacking blood cells.   ``This is not only more powerful, but it's far more selective''than conventional anti-rejection treatment, said Dr. Terry Strom,director of clinical immunology at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston.   ``This therapy only zaps the cells that are active (against thetransplanted organ) at that time and doesn't depress the(disease-fighting) immune system across the board,'' he said at theannual meeting of the American Society of Transplant Physicians.   Dr. Lawrence G. Hunsicker, the society's president, said thefindings represent `terribly important work.''   ``The hope is that you could get someone who needs a kidneytransplant and put in whatever one you have available,'' Hunsickersaid. ``Maybe (tissue) matching at that point wouldn't make adifference.''   Researchers have been working for nearly a decade on the newprotein, a fusion of a portion of the diphtheria toxin, one of thedeadliest known toxins, and the natural immune system proteininterleukin-2.   When the body's immune system is confronted with unfamiliarmaterial such as bacteria or a transplanted organ, it fights backwith a group of cells called T-cells.   The foreign substances activate a small number of T-cells, whichproduce interleukin-2 receptors, points on the cell surface towhich only interleukin-2 molecules will stick.   Activation of these receptors leads to an immunological cascadethat activates more harmful cells which then attack thetransplanted organ, leading to rejection of the foreign tissue.   To prevent this from happening, Strom and Dr. Jack Murphy, chiefof biomolecular medicine at Boston University Medical Center,isolated the part of the diphtheria toxin that binds it to othercells and replaced it with the binding portion of the interleukin-2molecule.   The result was a hybrid protein that seeks out and attaches toonly those T-cells harmful to transplanted organs, and kills theT-cells with the toxin.   ``The idea for this particular magic bullet is to use it rightafter the transplant,'' Strom said.   Over the past year, the researchers have tested the fusionprotein on mice that underwent heart transplants.   Ten mice were injected with the protein immediately aftertransplantation and received no other anti-rejection therapy, saidDr. Robert Kirkman, a transplant surgeon at Brigham and Women'sHospital in Boston. The injections were administered daily for 10days.   Nine of the 10 mice appeared to retain their new heartspermanently without need for chronic therapy, Kirkman said.   All the mice receiving the fusion protein fared better thanthose that received no treatment and those injected with only afragment of the diphtheria toxin.   ``We're encouraged. We like what we see,'' Kirkman said.   When the dose was increased 100 times, some kidney abnormalitieswere noted, Kirkman said, but no side effects were noted attherapeutic levels.   Cyclosporine, an anti-rejection drug approved for general use bythe U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1983, suppresses thebody's entire immune system and therefore enhances the risk ofinfection. Side effects include kidney failure, excessive hairgrowth and tremors.   Cyclosporine also costs transplant patients $5,000 a year ormore.   Researchers plan to test the fusion protein on monkeys, thenpatients suffering from T-cell leukemia without any other hope.Trials on transplant patients will follow, pending FDA approval.   In humans, it's likely the fusion protein will be accompanied bycyclosporine, Strom said.   ``We have reason to think it will work well with cyclosporine inlow doses,'' he said. ``So maybe a little bit of cyclosporine willgo a long way with this toxin.''   Researchers said the fusion protein eventually may be used totreat autoimmune diseases, in which the body produces a disorderedimmunological response against itself. Such diseases include formsof diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.   ``It's the promise for the future that's very exciting,'' Murphysaid.</TEXT></DOC>
