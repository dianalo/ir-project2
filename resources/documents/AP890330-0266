NWA Inc., parent of the Eagan, Minn.-based airline, refused tocomment on the unsolicited Davis bid, which the investor stressedwas friendly.   Davis, who made his fortune in oil and real estate and hastraded in Hollywood companies in recent years, said in revealinghis offer that he had already accumulated 3 percent of NWA stock.   He offered $90 a share for the company's 29.1 millionoutstanding shares for a buyout to be negotiated with management.   Northwest spokesman spokesman Bob Gibbons said company officialswould withhold comment until its board of directors had studied thebid, which was revealed late Thursday afternoon here.   On Tuesday, the airline's board adopted a ``poison pill''takeover defense in response to expressions of interest by apotential buyer whose identity the company wouldn't reveal. Thatsuitor has bought 4.9 percent of NWA's stock and expressed aninterest in a leveraged buyout, NWA said.   Davis' statement indicated he wasn't involved in the earlieroffer.   His bid, announced after the stock markets closed, values thecompany at considerably more that its current stock price. NWAshares closed at $68.25 Thursday, down from $68.75 the day before.   Davis, 63, former owner of 20th Century Fox Film Corp., saidthat if he were successful in buying Northwest, he would keep thecompany intact and under present management.   ``He believes that Minnesota is the logical and best place forthis airline,'' said Davis spokeswoman Mary Conway. ``There is nointention of selling off any assets to finance this deal.''   Davis is willing to boost his bid if the company agrees tonegotiate and demonstrates it is worth more, Ms. Conway said.   In response to the earlier suitor's expression of interest,Northwest management and unions promised to fight to remainindependent, and state officials suggested they might considerlegislation to hamper a hostile takeover. The company's poison pilldefense gives current stockholders the right to buy new stockcheaply in the event of a hostile takeover attempt, thereby makingit more costly to obtain a controlling amount of stock.   Guy Cook, head of Northwest's Machinists' union local, said:``Our main concern is does Marvin Davis or any other suitor wish torun an airline or make a lot of money and walk away? I would wantmore details before I make up my mind whether Marvin Davis is readyto come in and run an airline.''   Analysts have suggested the company is a tempting takeovertarget because of its lagging stock price and attractive realestate holdings in Tokyo.   NWA reported 1988 earnings of $135.1 million a share, up 31.1percent from $103 million in 1987. In August 1986, Northwestacquired rival Republic Airlines for $884 million.   Davis built his empire on Davis Oil Co. in Denver and onextensive real estate investments. He was in the news most recentlylast week when he teamed up with Prudential Insurance Co. to buySpectradyne, a Richardson, Texas, pay-television company, for $635million.   In March 1988, he was rebuffed in a $770 million bid for LorimarTelepictures Corp., a TV production firm that since was bought byWarner Communications Inc.   He bought 20th Century Fox in 1981 and sold it to media tychoonRupert Murdoch in 1985, making an estimated $325 million on thedeal. He also is rumored to have explored the possibility ofbidding on MGM-UA Communications Co. and Warner, which is in theprocess of merging with Time Inc.   His real estate holdings include the Snomwass, Buttermilk andAspen Mountain ski resorts in Colorado and golf courses in PebbleBeach, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
