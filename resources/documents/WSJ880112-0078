The project, in preparation for some time, underscores tensions between the Spanish company and its main shareholder, the Kuwait Investment Office.    The KIO, which controls at least 24.9% of Explosivos's capital, has been calling for a major say in the Spanish concern's management. Explosivos has rejected the KIO's advances, arguing that its defense operations make an influential role by a foreign shareholder undesirable.    An Explosivos spokesman said the plan to produce anti-tank missiles was one more reason for the company's unwillingness.    Explosivos said it plans a new unit, Cia. de Programas andamp; Desarrollos de la Defensa S.A., to design, develop and manufacture the anti-tank missile, with Hughes Aircraft Co. as technological partner. In the U.S., a spokesman for Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp., said: &quot;Negotiations regarding such a joint program are ongoing, but no firm conclusions have been reached.&quot;    Explosivos will hold 60% of the new concern, and two other closely held Spanish companies, Ceselsa and Instalaza S.A., will own 20% each. Explosivos said it will be the first time that a Spanish company takes such an extensive role in a high-technology defense project of this sort. </TEXT></DOC>
