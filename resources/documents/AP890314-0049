It is that vision, of mankind planted safely beyond the pale ofearthly limitations, that has kept the two plant scientists firm intheir commitment to space agriculture _ despite tight funding andthe knowledge they may not live to see their research implemented.   ``It's long-range research that really has to be done now to beused later,'' explained Bugbee, 38, the principal researcher for theuniversity's Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS)project.   ``And it's just plain interesting,'' he added. ``Something ascomplex as a closed life-support system is just fascinating. We'retrying to duplicate all the functions of planet Earth in arelatively small capsule.''   Bugbee and Salisbury, 62, who serves on the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration's Aerospace Medical Advisory Committee, sayit could be 30 years or more before a permanent human colony isestablished on the moon and another decade beyond that before Marsis settled.   Nonetheless, they are assured their work will survive them.   ``I don't think we can seriously talk about a permanent colony onthe moon or Mars without talking about CELSS,'' Salisbury said.   Plants raised under hydroponics are grown in nutrient-richsolutions rather than soil.   While funding for the hydroponic project _ about $130,000 a yearsince it was approved by NASA in 1981 _ is miniscule compared to thebillions spent on the nation's manned space flight program,Salisbury and Bugbee point with pride to its accomplishments.   Simulating as closely as possible the conditions of a lunar orMartian colonial farm through variations in lighting and atmosphere,the project has grown a Mexican dwarf variety of wheat _ Yecora Rojo_ with yields of 60 grams of edible wheat per square yard per day.   That is five times the estimated world record of 12-14 grams,Salisbury said.   Salisbury and Bugbee, believing they are near the theoreticalproduction limits for wheat in a extraterrestrial colony setting,say they will next turn their attention to wheat's performance inzero gravity _ a crucial consideration for the day when mankindembarks on space voyages too long to be sustained by stored food.   To that end, they are preparing an experiment for a future spaceshuttle mission. NASA has approved the project, but it has yet to bescheduled for flight, the two said in telephone interviews from theschool's campus in Logan, 60 miles north of Salt Lake City.   Salisbury and Bugbee say a space farm could feed the Marsmission's crew and purify air and water supplies. For example, a13-square-yard space farm could feed one person indefinitely.   Looking beyond exploration to colonization of the moon and Mars,the researchers believe a farm about the size of a football fieldcould provide the food and oxygen needs of 100 or more people.   A hydroponic space farm, unlike those on Earth, would not bemaintained as one huge unit but be made up of a number ofself-contained compartments to guard against the spread of any plantdiseases. Further, it likely would produce far more food thanneeded, ranging from 20 percent to 100 percent more, as a hedgeagainst unexpected losses.   Failure of a Martian colony's food supply, with help from Earthat a minimum of 35 million miles away, would be catastrophic.   Salisbury and Bugbee aren't the only ones researching space foodproduction.   The University of Wisconsin has worked on white potatoes, NorthCarolina State has worked on soybeans and researchers at Purdue haveexperimented with lettuce. Scientists at Tuskegee University haveworked on developing a sweet potato that can be grown on the moon.   In the Soviet Union, scientists have developed a highlyproductive strain of wheat, Salisbury said.   ``In terms of yield, the Russians are ahead, but ours is moreefficient,'' he said, noting the Soviet space wheat produces morebut requires several times the light that its American counterpartdoes.</TEXT></DOC>
