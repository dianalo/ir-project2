The result isan exciting novel that nicely mixes software theory withfast-paced action.   The world-class hacker in Mr. Harrington's fiction is60-year-old Darius Whitney, author of a computer-languageprogram that became an industry standard. Despite hiscreative brilliance, Whitney has lost practical control ofhis own company to &quot;the pencil pushers&quot; -- business types whoregard the curmudgeonly genius as more burden than asset.Little better now than an employee of Whitney Data Dynamics,the embittered founder determines secretly to sabotage WDD'snew product through the injection of an insidious computervirus. If he can't regain control of his firm, Darius Whitneyfigures, at least he can topple those who are running it.</LP><TEXT>   Phase one of Whitney's revenge is a spectacular nationwidemalfunction of the U.S. airlines' computerized reservationssystem, timed to occur just before Thanksgiving, the busiesttravel day of the year. The resulting chaos damages WDD'sreputation, when rumors link the snafu to a flaw in thecompany's latest software package.   The nasty prank also brings Darius Whitney to theattention of Virgilio Cordero, one of &quot;los Senores,&quot;enormously wealthy Latin American drug traffickers. Corderooffers to buy Whitney Data Dynamics and return it to Darius'scontrol, if the maverick computer whiz will devise a virusenabling Cordero's cocaine-laden aircraft to elude theFederal Aviation Administration's tracking systems.   Meanwhile, Whitney has aroused the suspicions of computersecurity expert Scott Vandenberg, who has pegged Darius asthe probable mastermind of the airlines' Thanksgivingheadache. Working with Nancy Delacorte, an FAA agent withwhom he (of course) becomes romantically involved, Vandenbergdoes his best to track and foil Whitney's progress in atechno-odyssey that shuttles from Malibu to Washington, D.C.,to Las Vegas to Bogota, Colombia.   One of the things that makes &quot;Virus&quot; so engaging is theunobtrusive fashion in which it balances explanations andevents. Mr. Harrington, a licensed pilot and a computerconsultant as well as the author of 14 previous novels, findsways to impart necessary technical information to theuninitiated reader without either being heavy-handed orimpeding the progress of his gripping tale. It's alsocheering that the characters in &quot;Virus&quot; are more dimensionalthan the rudimentary stick figures who often populatetechno-thrillers. Despite the inclusion of some familiarsituations (druglord summit meets, Oval Office chats) thatmight easily have been occasions of cliche, &quot;Virus&quot; maintainsenough credibility for a healthy dose of enjoyment.   It's a disease bacterium, not a computer virus, thatthreads its way through the preposterous happenings in RobinCook's latest medico-thriller, &quot;Vital Signs&quot; (Putnam, 396pages, $21.95).   In-vitro fertilization is the cutting-edge technology thatprovides the jumping-off point for this 11th book by Dr.Cook, author of &quot;Coma.&quot; The heroine of the novel, Bostonpediatrician-epidemiologist Marissa Blumenthal, is a veteranof a previous Cook offering, &quot;Outbreak.&quot;   Married now to an insensitive spouse preoccupied with hiswork, Marissa is enduring a frustrating series of attempts tobecome pregnant through the in-vitro method. The Women'sClinic, the costly state-of-the-art facility where Dr.Blumenthal undergoes treatment, claims an impressive successrate. But there are disquieting things about this glossyclinic. Its security guards are armed with massive handguns.Patients have difficulty gaining access to their own records.And one troublesome woman plunges to her death from theclinic's sixth floor -- suicide, or murder?   Marissa finds a confidante in ophthalmologist WendyWilson, old med-school classmate and fellow patient at theclinic. Together they probe into the unusually high incidenceof Women's Clinic clients whose infertility is attributed toapparent tubercular infections. Has TB mutated into avenereal disease? Are the women doctors onto a dangerous newphenomenon akin to toxic-shock syndrome? And what role isbeing played in all this by the clinic's secretive staff?   The two women's quest leads to a sleuthing vacation inAustralia, where a similar incidence of sterility-inducinginfections has been reported. Eventually Marissa makes herway to Hong Kong, as her investigations indicate theinvolvement of Chinese gangster societies in a bizarreconspiracy of international proportions.   All of this makes for a pretty outlandish yarn -- parttravelogue, part soap opera and mostly hokum. Stereotypedcharacters appear and disappear in unbelievable fashion,their attitudes and behavior changing mid-chapter to serve aludicrous plot. Readers lured by the notion of learningsomething useful here about in-vitro matters might do betterto look at a less, ah, fanciful work.   The good Dr. Cook has provided for that. Like awell-meaning TV-movie, &quot;Vital Parts&quot; concludes with a&quot;read-more-about-it&quot; bibliography.</TEXT></DOC>
