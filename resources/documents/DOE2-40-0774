The product of the Drude-model parameterswpt 1 indicates that the plasma oscillations are overdamped. The free-carrierelectrodynamics are well described by a frequency-dependent scatteringrate which rises linearly in frequency from the dc value and saturatesat a value consistent with scattering at the unitarity limit with a concomitantfrequency-dependent mass enhancement.</TEXT></DOC>
