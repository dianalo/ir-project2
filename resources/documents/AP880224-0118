(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jimmy Swaggart was followed to a``crummy'' motel by men who let air out of his tires andphotographed him as he tried to put a spare tire on backwards,visited a reputed prostitute and was confronted by a rivalevangelist, a church leader said.   James Hamill of Memphis, Tenn., a member of the general councilof the Assemblies of God, the nation's largest Pentecostaldenomination, described the pictures in an interview with WBRZ-TVhere Tuesday.   He also said he expects the council to strengthen the punishmentSwaggart receives from executives of his 2 million-memberdenomination after admitting ``moral failures.''   The Louisiana district council has recommended a three-monthsuspension and counseling for the TV evangelist, whose ministryreaches more than 100 countries and reported $142 million in incomelast year.   ``The constitution and bylaws require at least a year'scessation of active ministry,'' Hamill said.   The executive presbytery of the Assemblies of God will make thefinal decision in the Swaggart case. Rev. Everett Stenhouse,Assemblies of God general secretary, said the group was tentativelyscheduled to meet Thursday.   Church spokeswoman Juleen Turnage said an extra telephoneoperator had to be hired at church headquarters in Springfield,Mo., to handle some of the hundreds of calls about the case. Shesaid Swaggart had as many supporters as detractors among thecallers.   Hamill described the photographs that led Swaggart to make atearful confession of sin Sunday, and disclosed that the Rev.Marvin Gorman of New Orleans was directly involved in thepicture-taking.   Last year, Gorman sued Swaggart for $90 million charging himwith unjustly accusing Gorman of repeatedly committing adultery.Gorman admitted a single ``immoral act'' with a woman.   The pictures, which ABC News reported last week were given todenomination leaders by Gorman, ``showed a motel _ a crummy littlething built in an L-shape _ they showed the number of thisparticular room and a woman accused of being a prostitute admittingseveral different men into the room, and eventually Jimmy Swaggartgoing into the room and later coming out of the room,'' Hamill said.   ``And she came out a few moments behind him, and (Swaggart) hada flat tire on his car. These men who made the pictures had the letair out of his tires.   ``When he went into the room, they called Rev. Gorman and hecame down and Jimmy Swaggart was changing his tire, and there'spictures of he and Gorman talking to one another, just pictures, nosound,'' Hamill said.   Swaggart struggled with the tire and ``he put the wheel onbackwards,'' Hamill said.   Swaggart couldn't be reached for comment; church officialswouldn't say where he was.   Gorman attorney Hunter W. Lundy confirmed that he employed aprivate investigator, Reed Scott Bailey, in connection with thelawsuit against Swaggart.   Bailey and another investigator visited a strip of cheap motelson Airline Highway between Baton Rouge and New Orleans to askquestions about Swaggart, a motel resident said.   The woman, who identified herself as Peggy Carrier, 39, wasquoted by the New Orleans Times-Picayune as saying Swaggart onseveral occasions visited two Airline Highway motels, where hewould park his Lincoln Town Car in the rear.   Syndicated columnist Cal Thomas, who specializes infundamentalist religions, said reports that Swaggart soughtpornographic acts rather than sexual intercourse probably led theLouisiana council to conclude that he had not technically committedadultery, which would have resulted in a harsher punishment.   One of the state council members involved in recommendingrehabilitation for Swaggart said the presbyters regard his ministryas a gift from God.   ``We had to look beyond the man to the ministry God has givenhim,'' said the Rev. Jonathan Ziegler of Violet.   ``Our objective was not only to rehabilitate a man but to save aunique ministry that feeds thousands of children a day, supports amultitude of missionaries and helps improve countless lives withthe Gospel of Jesus Christ,'' Ziegler said.   Meanwhile, the Christian Broadcasting Network announcedWednesday that it will not carry any programs from the Swaggartministry in which he personally appears so long as Swaggart issuspended by his denomination.   ``We have arrived at an arrangement whereby the Swaggartministries will provide alternative programming,'' said BentonMiller, spokesman for CBN.</TEXT></DOC>
