The National Association of Manufacturers says it would retard investment. Conservative columnist Warren Brookes calls it an &quot;economic neutron bomb.&quot;    Behind all that immodest rhetoric, employment experts say, lies a very modest proposal to require advance notification of plant closings.    In its watered-down version, the plant-closing measure would require large companies to give employees 60 days' notice of major closings -- a practice already common at most of the nation's largest and most successful concerns. And the legislation is chock full of loopholes through which hard-pressed companies can easily escape.    &quot;You have to have pretty unenlightened, closed-minded management not to be able to adjust to something like this,&quot; says Russell Sutherland, recently retired vice president for engineering and technology at Deere andamp; Co. &quot;It's not that horrendous.&quot;    The fierce fight over the plant-closing legislation, like much of what goes on in Washington these days, has become a triumph of symbol over substance. The AFL-CIO is vigorously promoting the measure, in an effort to demonstrate its clout in a Democratic-controlled Congress. And business is equally determined to defeat it.    &quot;The paranoia level is really, really high,&quot; says Mary Tavenner, a lobbyist for the National Associaton of Wholesaler-Distributors. &quot;The labor unions perceive themselves as controlling Congress right now, and the business groups are trying to keep the tanks from coming over the hill.&quot;    &quot;The Chamber of Commerce, in particular, has its back in the air because of the whole problem of labor legislation,&quot; charges Howard Samuel, president of the Industrial Union Department of the AFL-CIO. &quot;Anything that happens, they are going to oppose and go red in the face. It has very little to do with the substance.&quot;    The plant-closing measure was approved by the Senate last month as part of its trade bill, but it will be up to House-Senate conferees to decide whether that provision remains in the final bill. The House-passed trade bill hasn't any similar provision, although the House Education and Labor Committee approved a stronger plant-closing bill in June.    The real issue in the plant-closing battle is the business community's fear -- and labor's hope -- that the measure will be &quot;the camel's nose under the tent.&quot; The unions have a long list of legislative proposals that would force more benefits from business, such as a higher minimum wage, mandated health benefits and parental leave. Many members of Congress, facing severe budget constraints on their ability to expand government programs, are inclined to support labor's regulatory agenda.    &quot;The government can't fund new programs, so instead it is going to put its hands in business's pockets,&quot; says Pete Lunnie, director of labor relations for the National Association of Manufacturers.    &quot;There is a total package up there, which together all works in the direction of imposing rigidities on our labor market,&quot; agrees Mr. Sprinkel. &quot;We don't want to repeat the failed experiment of Western Europe resulting from mandated costs on the private sector.&quot;    Despite such fears, a look at the substance of the plant-closing legislation indicates it is a mild measure, and reflects a policy supported by most of academia and the business community, as well as labor.    In the first place, most of America's top companies already give their employees advance notice of plant closings. A study of 224 large corporations by the Conference Board, a business research group, found that about 87% of them gave employees some advance notice of closings, and nearly half gave more than three months' notice -- well over the 60 days required in the proposed law.    Furthermore, the practice of giving advance notice has been endorsed not only by labor groups but also by most major business organizations. The National Association of Manufacturers, a leader in the fight against the plant-closing proposal, &quot;considers that early notice of plant closings is beneficial in assisting the dislocated worker find new employment,&quot; according to its official policy book. The Business Roundtable urges companies closing plants &quot;to provide the longest practicable notification to affected workers and communities.&quot;    And a recent Labor Department task force on the subject also agreed that &quot;advance notification to employees and the community of plant closings and large-scale permanent layoffs is good employer practice.&quot;    Administration and business groups argue that they support voluntary notice, but not mandatory notice. &quot;We don't have any quarrel that employers should provide advance notification,&quot; says Mr. Lunnie. &quot;We just don't want legislation.&quot;    An extensive study by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that the benefits of requiring two to three months' advance notice of plant closings more than outweigh any costs. Failure to give notice, the study argued, increases the duration of workers' unemployment, which in turn increases the cost of unemployment insurance to the government. Moreover, the study found that while many of the nation's largest companies routinely give advance notice, most small and medium ones don't. A General Accounting Office survey of companies smaller than those in the Conference Board study, for example, found that fewer than 20% gave more than a month's notice.    Experts also argue that large plant closings can have a devastating effect on small communities. Early notice makes it easier for the community to make needed adjustments in such things as school budgets and other services affected by a shrinking tax base.    &quot;Quite frankly, it surprised me&quot; that so many companies didn't give notice, says Mr. Sutherland, who served on the academy's study panel. &quot;We felt that it had to be mandatory.&quot;    Critics of the legislation say the burden of advance notice is too great for small companies. But the Senate measure exempts those with fewer than 100 employees. Critics also complain that the bill affects layoffs as well as closings, but the measure only includes layoffs that exceed six months and involve at least one-third of the work force.    Business lobbyists also complain that public notice can undermine the efforts of companies trying to get credit or business they need to stay open. But in order to win votes for the proposal, the authors -- Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) and Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) -- added an exception for companies actively seeking credit or business in the hopes of staying afloat.    The result, says David Mowery of the Academy of Sciences, &quot;is quite a bit less far-reaching than what is on the books in many European nations.&quot;    ---       Notice of Plant Closings   Survey of 224 large companies wiht median sales of $600million                           Companies No notice                        30 Less than 3 months               92 3-5 months                       48 6-11 months                      37 More than one year               17   Source: Conference Board</TEXT></DOC>
