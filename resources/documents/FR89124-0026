The Memorandum Opinion and Order, adopted November 17, 1988, approved,with a minor condition, the ATandamp;T Open Network Architecture (ONA) planfiled on February 1, 1988. The Commission established ATandamp;T's ONA planfiling requirement in its reconsideration order in Phase I of the <T3>Computer III</T3> proceeding. ATandamp;T's ONA requirements differ fromthose for the BOCs, in part because ATandamp;T, unlike the BOCs, participatesin the competitive market for interexchange basic services. 2. The Commission found that ATandamp;T's ONA plan adequately described themanner in which it planned to respond to the needs of competing enhancedservice providers (ESPs) for equal and efficient access to its basic services.The Commission also approved ATandamp;T's description of: (1) Its capabilitiesavailable to transport unbundled basic service functions; (2) its arrangementsfor providing such transport in a nondiscriminatory manner; and (3) itsprocedures for responding to requests of the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs)and other local exchange carriers (LECs) for new forms of transport forother basic functions. In addition, the Commission approved ATandamp;T'sdescription of its implementation of Comparably Efficient Interconnection(CEI) and the other nonstructural safeguards for the enhanced servicesit now offers using facilities that are not collocated with basic servicefacilities. 3. The Commission approved ATandamp;T's treatment of its basic Accunet PacketService (APS) as a ``building block'' for a number of its enhanced services.In addition, the Commission approved ATandamp;T's proposal to use a passwordidentification system, as well as administrative and managerial procedures,to comply with the Commission's rules regarding customer proprietary networkinformation (CPNI). 4. As a condition of approval of ATandamp;T's ONA plan, the Commission requiredATandamp;T to comply with the CEI requirements for noncollocated enhancedservices for a specific service known as REDI-ACCESS that ATandamp;T co-marketswith Control Data Corporation or, alternatively, file a statement withthe Common Carrier Bureau within 60 days of the release of this order explainingwhy ATandamp;T should not be required to comply with these requirements forREDI-ACCESS. <ITAG tagnum="84">Ordering Clauses </ITAG>5.
