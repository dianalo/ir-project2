Copies of a letter concerning the abuse of confidential, insider information obtained from companies while speculating in their stocks were mailed to 1,519 companies listed on the exchange's first and second sections, an official said.    Although the letter avoided directly condemning insider trading, it urged that participants keep their actions consistent with existing legal guidelines for such trading, the official said.    The letter, in Japanese, wasn't sent to foreign firms listed on the exchange, officials said. However, the dealers association sent a similar letter to ranking executives of Japanese and foreign securities houses alike.    Separately, the association also said it is proposing &quot;insider registration cards&quot; for company officials and major stockholders to curb insider trading in stocks. While insider trading in a broad sense is illegal under Japanese law, regulations and enforcement mechanisms lag behind those of other countries.    The letters were part of cooperation among the U.S., Britain and Japan to boost surveillance of insider trading abuses, finance ministry officials said. </TEXT></DOC>
