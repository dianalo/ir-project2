They range in age from 18 to69, with most between 25 and 39. Eighty are lifers. Six are men.   ``The history of Muncy is very typical of women's prisons,'' Ms.Nicholas says. ``It was built at a time when it was fashionable tobelieve that the appropriate treatment of women offenders andjuvenile offenders was to send them far out into the countryside toobtain fresh air and good healthy work and to remove them from thecorrupting influences of the city.''   Muncy's setting in rural Lycoming County is within a short driveof the Federal Correctional Institution at Lewisburg and theAllenwood Federal Prison Camp, but it's a four- to five-hour drivefrom Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, where most of Muncy's inmatescome from.   The distance became a sex-discrimination issue in the lawsuit,because many men's prisons are closer to major cities wherefamilies can visit more easily.   ``You cannot travel to Muncy by public transportation forvisiting hours,'' Ms. Nicholas says. ``This is absolutelydevastating to women who need to maintain contact with their kids.''   A $4,000 contract with the Salvation Army to providetransportation for children and care-givers is awaiting prisonapproval, says Steve Jacobsen, president of Project IM-PACT (InsideMuncy-Parents and Children Together), a new program that provides ahomelike setting for inmates to meet with children inside theprison.   Apprenticeships, following the example set in federal prisons,were started at Muncy in 1979. Inmates can qualify for a license inupholstery, caning and refinishing furniture, auto mechanics, foodservices and building construction and maintenance.   Elsie Denison, who promoted prison apprenticeships beforeretiring from the Women's Bureau of the U.S. Labor Department, saysMuncy had an exemplary program that not only offered good trainingbut helped inmates find jobs or further training once they leftprison.   Two job-placement specialists travel around the state lookingfor jobs that would be suitable for inmates completing their termsand helping them make the adjustment.   The prison this fall will open a power sewing factory which willbe part of the prison system's Correctional Industries, allowinginmates to earn a bonus while learning skills that could help themfind jobs outside prison.   The suit's complaint that women with psychiatric problemsreceived inadequate treatment has been resolved with the temporaryconversion of one cottage into state-certified mental healthclinic. An $840,000 mental health addition to the prison infirmaryis awaiting an architect.   The lawsuit's complaints about fire safety and asbestos have metwith divergent fates.   ``Prisoners at Muncy are housed in buildings with antiquatedcell-lock systems, requiring that each of 40 to 45 cells beunlocked by hand by the guard on duty in the event of fire or otheremergency,'' the suit stated.   A $1.89 million project to install an electronic locking system,fire detectors, emergency exits and lighting was completed Sept.25, 1986, says Kenneth G. Robinson, press secretary for theDepartment of Corrections. The project was part of a systemwideimprovement in the prisons' Life Safety Code, he said.   Still unresolved is the presence of asbestos, a mineral fiberonce widely used in building products but now associated withcertain types of cancer.   Two inspectors hired by the plaintiffs in October 1987 foundasbestos-containing materials throughout the institution. JerryRoseman and Lynne Lamstein of Occupational Health ConsultationServices Inc. in Bethlehem said in their report that prisonmaintenance workers had tried to remove and repair the materialswithout proper training.   On March 8, nearly three months after the inspectors' report wassent to state attorneys, two inmates and two staff maintenanceworkers were asked to work above and around crumbling asbestos frompipes, according to a court motion filed in April.   Robinson says the department now has contracted with LancasterLaboratories of Lancaster to review the extent of the asbestosproblem.   Miss Wiggins, interviewed in the formal conference room of theprison administration building, said the suit has not endeared herto all inmates.   ``There are those inmates who feel, and maybe rightly so, thatwe shouldn't make such a fuss,'' she says.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 30</NOTE></DOC>
