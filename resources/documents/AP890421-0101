Police sources said Friday they wereinvestigating the possibility of suicide.   The 64-year-old Nyagumbo, who died Thursday night, resigned hisposts as senior minister for political affairs and administrativesecretary of the ruling party after he was found by a presidentialinquiry to be involved in a racket involving the selling of carsand trucks on the black market.   He was one of the few surviving founders of the Zimbabwe AfricanNational Union (Patriotic Front), the party that waged a seven-yearguerrilla war and led the white-governed British colony of Rhodesiato independence. Tuesday was the ninth anniversary of Zimbabwe'sindependence.   Nyagumbo was being treated in the intensive care unit ofHarare's Parirenyatwa Hospital after being admitted withconvulsions on Wednesday. The nature of Nyagumbo's illness wasbeing kept a secret by authorities, but police sources said theywere investigating the possibility he poisoned himself.   On Thursday, hospital superintendent Sam Mutamba told thesemi-official Zimabwe Inter-African News Agency that Nyagumbo'scondition was stable, but he would not disclose the nature of theillness.   Later, as rumors circulated Harare that Nyagumbo had died as aresult of poisoning, the superintendent told Ziana: ``The man isstill alive in this hospital. Do not worry about those rumorsflying around. These are rumors from people who wish him dead.''   Nyagumbo, who had ranked third-highest in the party hierarchy,was not invited to the independence celebrations earlier this week.   He had spent two decades in colonial prisons as an allegedterrorist and was widely acclaimed by black Zimbabweans as one ofthe champions of political emancipation.   Like most emergent black leaders, Nyagumbo had humblebeginnings. He was a herdboy from a village in the easternhighlands of Zimbabwe.   After being educated in neighboring South Africa, where hewaited on tables at whites-only hotels, he became a member of thelocal Communist Party. He was expelled in 1955 for links to theso-called Mau Mau movement that yielded black rule in the Britishcolony of Kenya.   At home, under successive white supremacist regimes, he becamemore active in his crusade for black rule and spent much of hisadult life behind bars.   But after independence he held key posts in the Cabinet, the15-member Politburo and the ruling party's 90-strong centralcommittee.   The judicial commission of inquiry set up by Mugabe foundNyagumbo abused his position by arranging for friends to buy 38cars and trucks directly from a state assembly plant. OrdinaryZimbabweans usually have to wait up to 10 years to by a vehicle.   Judge President Wilson Sandura, who presented his report toMugabe on March 11, said he did not believe Nyagumbo arranged thedeals without rewards.   The minister himself denied receiving kickbacks, but resignedhis posts anyway.   Nyagumbo was the most senior of six ministers to testify. Fourother ministers, a junior minister and a provincial governor haveall since resigned their posts over links to corruption this month.   Police say they are considering prosecuting many of the 60witnesses who gave evidence before Judge President Wilson Sandura.   There was no comment from Mugabe on the death of his old ally.</TEXT></DOC>
