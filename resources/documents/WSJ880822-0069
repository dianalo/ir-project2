Myers </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LABOR </CO><IN> ECO </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Has the U.S. unemployment rate, which hit a 14-year low of 5.3% in June, dropped about as far as it's going?    That it got that low surprises many economists. As long as 3 1/2 years ago, with the economic expansion apparently aging and the jobless rate at 7.4% of the labor force, they suspected that unemployment had already hit bottom. And beginning in 1968, the lows in unemployment from one business cycle to the next had trended alarmingly higher, from 3.4% to 4.6% in 1973, to 5.6% in 1979, to 7.2% in 1981.    As the figures soured, the non-accelerating-inflation rate of unemployment -- the rate that can't be reduced without speeding up inflation -- was generally believed to have risen to about 6%. That 6% was evenly divided, most economists held, between frictional unemployment -- workers voluntarily between jobs -- and structural unemployment -- workers with inadequate skills.    This concept of a natural rate of unemployment is admittedly vague; you can't pin it down with statistics. Audrey Freedman, a labor economist at the Conference Board, comments that it can't be known &quot;until we get wage inflation due to tight labor-supply conditions&quot; -- a bit like saying you can't see that truck coming until it hits you.    But it's important. If unemployment has already fallen to its natural rate, it can't safely be reduced further. So, hunches about that natural rate strongly influence notions of appropriate fiscal and monetary policy.    Even though economists can't pinpoint the natural rate, most believe it rose in the 1970s and now has fallen.    &quot;Before the baby-boomers and women entered the labor force in substantial numbers,&quot; says Roger H. Fulton, an economist at A. Gary Shilling andamp; Co., &quot;a general unemployment rate of 4%-5% was viewed as full employment. Because the two groups lacked experience and training, which limited the types of jobs they could handle, economists concluded that the economy could be faced with greater structural unemployment.&quot;    But today, Mr. Fulton notes, &quot;women have become an integral part of the nation's work force and most baby-boomers have moved into the 25-44 year age group, generally considered to be the prime productivity age ranges. . . . And because of declining birth rates, teen-agers now comprise an abnormally small percentage of workers.&quot;    Edward Yardeni of Prudential-Bache Securities believes that these &quot;demographic forces should push the unemployment rate down to 4% by 1990&quot; -- and perhaps sooner. He notes that during the 1970s, when &quot;the baby-boomers overwhelmed the job market,&quot; the labor force grew 24 million, up from 12.3 million in the 1960s and only seven million in the 1950s. But last year, he says, 16-to-24-year-olds fell to 19.2% of the labor force from the 1978 peak of 24.5%.    &quot;The 'birth dearth' which followed the baby boom is already helping push the unemployment rate back down toward levels not seen since the mid-1970s,&quot; he adds.    However, Mrs. Freedman contends that the non-inflationary rate of unemployment has dropped not because of demographic trends, which peaked in the mid-1970s, but because &quot;employers' wage-setting practices have changed. They no longer engage in a great deal of wage imitation. Now, employers are not looking at each other but at their own companies' competitive situations and their own unit labor costs.&quot;    Still worried about foreign competition and still able to take advantage of labor unions' weakness, employers probably won't start bidding wars to get workers. &quot;Corporate managers are unlikely to suddenly offer big wage hikes after they spent five years cutting costs,&quot; Mr. Yardeni says.    The point at which low unemployment becomes inflationary also is affected by what is driving it down. If it is low because of genuine prosperity, it isn't as inflationary as demand force-fed by government, whose borrowing tends to flood the economy with too much money.    Also important is how people react.    If consumers see inflation rising, they may step up their spending to try to beat price increases. The faster money is flowing through the economy, the more inflationary bang for a given rise in the number of bucks.    And if workers demand more pay, they also can boost inflation. So far, a Smith Barney research report sees &quot;no clear proof that wage inflation is accelerating.&quot; Gregory Gieber, an economist at the securities firm, cites the year-to-year gains in a key private-sector employment-cost index. &quot;After holding relatively flat around 3.2% from mid-1986 through the first quarter of 1988,&quot; he writes, &quot;wage inflation jumped to 3.7% in the second quarter. . . . However, the rate is still low relative to the late 1970s-early 1980s and less than might be expected, based on historical relationships between economic or employment growth and wage rates.&quot;    The fact that New England's unemployment averaged only 3.4% last year may indicate that the jobless rate could fall considerably below 5% elsewhere, too.    But the closer to plant capacity the economy is operating, the faster low unemployment pushes up costs and prices. And operating rates are rising; in July, they reached 83.5%, the highest since March 1980. Meanwhile, productivity gains, which can offset rising costs, are lagging, held down by slow growth in the service sector. Productivity fell in the second period, and Merrill Lynch sees it up less than 1% in the second half.    The risk of inflation is clearly rising, and, once again, many analysts doubt unemployment can fall much further. Mr. Gieber calculates that unemployment, adjusted for the demographic changes, was 5.5% in July, matching its level in 1979, &quot;when the economy appeared to be starting to overheat.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
