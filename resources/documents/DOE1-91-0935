Results revealed a nonrandom karyotypic profileincluding aneuploidy and considerable variation in chromosome number(range 40 {yields} 200). All tumors examined displayed numerical abnormalities,with the most common numeric change being a gain of chromosome 7. Anattempt was then made to correlate the observed chromosome 7 changeswith activation of the cellular proto-oncogene c-erb-B, whose produceis the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Six human glial tumorswere analyzed for {sup 125}I-EGF binding, EGFR gene copy number, EGFRgene rearrangement, mRNA expression, and karyotypic profile. Saturationanalysis at 4{sup 0}C revealed significant numbers of EGFR's in all 6tumors. Southern blotting analysis utilizing cDNA probes for the EGFRfailed to demonstrate significant amplification or structural rearrangementof the EFGR gene. The results suggest that overexpression of the EGFRmay be related to an alternative mechanism, other than gene amplificationand elevated mRNA levels, such as the regulation of receptor biosynthesisand degradation. In summary, findings indicate that alterations of chromosome7 are the most prevalent chromosomal change in human glial tumors, andthat these alterations may lead to overexpression of the protooncogenec-erb-B.</TEXT></DOC>
