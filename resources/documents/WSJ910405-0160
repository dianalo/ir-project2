Gun-control laws can never substitute for the hard work ofapprehending and convicting criminals. Still, the Brady billis a small price to pay if Congress also agrees to theadministration's crime bill.   No one believes that this gun bill would have a measurableeffect on violent crime, or even that it would have stoppedJohn Hinkley from buying the gun he used five months later toshoot Mr. Reagan and James Brady. There would be a seven-daywaiting period before any gun dealer sells a handgun to acustomer. During that week, state law-enforcement officialscan (but wouldn't have to) investigate whether the purchaseris a felon or has spent time in a mental institution. The guncould be sold at the end of the week unless the police findthe evidence to stop the sale.   The first problem is that there is no way of knowing whois a felon, much less a mental patient. There is no computerlist of the criminal records from the states. Nine states donot even require that courts report the final disposition offelony cases. At the federal level, the FBI doesn't haverecords showing the final results in half of its arrests. TheBrady bill would not create any national record of people whocannot buy handguns. With no list for gun dealers to consult,the bill's effectiveness dims.   There is also something breathtaking in the claim thatcrime can be stopped by regulating gun dealers. AttorneyGeneral Dick Thornburgh calls this the &quot;17% solution.&quot; Fewerthan one-in-five handguns acquired by felons are bought fromgun dealers. There is an active gun market, includingrent-a-gun operations in some public-housing projects. Makingit harder to buy from legitimate dealers will boost streetsales.   Gun control has become the $600 toilet seat of the crimedebate. Yes, it would be good to keep firearms out of thehands of felons and the mentally incompetent. But all thetalk about gun control has prevented the serious discussionon crime this country desperately needs to have.   For example, why don't we have records of felons? Part ofthe answer is to imagine how long it would take an ACLUaffiliate somewhere to file a lawsuit alleging that therights of felons or certifiably dangerous mental patientswould be violated by a national registry.   As with the drug problem, the only solution to crimes withguns is on the demand side. Americans own perhaps 150 millionfirearms; that is more guns than cars. Even if we somehowbanned sales of all weapons from butter knives to importedsemi-automatics, the current supply is more than adequate forstreet crimes.   This is why a Brady bill, which won't work but which alsowon't cause much harm, would be a reasonable trade-off forthe Bush crime bill. Under the administration's bill,criminals, especially ones who use firearms, would face morecertain punishment. The bill would finally limit the endlessappeals from death-penalty convictions and create new deathpenalties for drug-related killings.   Our favorite provision would offer more effective guncontrol than the Brady bill. This is Mr. Thornburgh's&quot;inclusionary rule&quot; to replace the exclusionary rule's absurdresult that a criminal goes free because a constableblundered. The jury would still get to see the evidence ofthe gun and convict the criminal even where evidence of afirearm is obtained under a faulty search warrant or someother technical problem. Instead of keeping the truth fromjurors, the evidence would be allowed. But to encouragelawful searches, the Justice Department would also set up asystem to pay compensation to people who are wrongly searchedand to discipline erring officers directly.   Over the past 30 years, everything from &quot;Miranda&quot;censoring of confessions to activist judges declaring thatjails are &quot;too crowded&quot; has created a reign of lawlessness.The chances of a crime leading to an arrest, conviction andserious prison term are well under one-in-100 in many partsof the country. We may have more people in jail than everbefore, but it is still true that a rational criminal cancalculate the odds that crime does pay.   Gun-control proposals only hide the deeper problem thatthe country still lacks the will to punish criminals. Ouridea of real gun and crime control starts with freeing thelaw-enforcement system from the many procedural hurdles thatdeter it from providing law, order and justice.</TEXT></DOC>
