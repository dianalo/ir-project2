Public Order Minister Anastasios Sehiotis said police had beenable to piece together events leading up to the attack by gunmen onpassengers of the liner City of Poros on July 11. Nine people werekilled and 98 were wounded in the gunfire and grenade attack off aGreek island.   Sehiotis said the government suspects that Hejab Jaballa, whoholds a Libyan passport, led the guerrilla attack.   Police had also identified Jaballa as taking part in theassassination of an Egyptian newspaper editor in Nicosia, Cyprus,in 1978, he said.   Jaballa's fingerprints from Cyprus were matched with thoseuncovered in his Athens hideouts, Sehiotis said.   Renegade Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal said in a magazineinterview after the Egyptian was shot that his group wasresponsible for the assassination. Abu Nidal, whose real name isSabri Banna, gets much of his funding from Libyan leader MoammarGadhafi and maintains headquarters in Tripoli.   Sehiotis identified the other three suspects as Aboul Amoud,Adnan Sojod and Merhi Mehieddine. Their nationalities were notknown. The minister read a prepared statement and declined toanswer reporters' questions.   The statement failed to clarify whether any of the suspects weredead or had fled the country.   Police believe that one or possibly two of the suspects may havedied either in an explosion on the ship's bridge as they lobbedhand grenades or in a car bomb that apparently detonatedprematurely at a marina near Athens six hours before the City ofPoros was scheduled to dock.   Two occupants of the car were killed by the explosion.   The minister said Jaballa arrived in Greece on a flight fromCopenhagen June 1. His alleged accomplices arrived from Beirut viaBelgrade in May.   All four men rented apartments or stayed in various hotels,changing locations often prior to the day of the ship attack,Sehiotis said.   ``All the evidence indicates that Jaballa played the leadingrole in the terrorist operation since he had all the details ofmembers of his group in his possession,'' said Sehiotis.   Ministry officials distributed copies of photographs from forgedpassports found in hotel rooms and apartments the men allegedlystayed in and at the site of the car explosion.   Greek police have been reluctant to discuss what terrorist groupcould be responsible for the attack on the ship. But CIA directorWilliam Webster said in Washington last week that it appeared to bethe work of the Abu Nidal group.   At a separate news conference, Merchant Marine ministerEvangelos Yannopoulos said security had been boosted at all mainports and that commandoes would now be permanent crew members ofcruise liners.   He said each ship would have ``five to 10 specially trainedcommandoes'' aboard responsible for neutralizing terrorists attacks.   Yannopoulos was asked whether a dead 23-year-old Frenchpassenger, Laurent Vigneron, was part of the terrorist group. Greekauthorities have linked him to the attack, but French officialshave said they find no evidence he was involved.   ``There are indications _ based on the testimony of fourwitnesses _ that he (Vigneron) participated in the terroristattack,'' said Yannopoulos.   He said an autopsy showed that Vigneron was hit by bullets inhis shoulder but these were not the cause of his death. He did notelaborate.   Meanwhile, security at the nation's borders, ports and at AthensInternational Airport was tight.   Passengers boarding cruise ships and ferries were scrutinizedclosely and their luggage passed through X-ray machines.</TEXT></DOC>
