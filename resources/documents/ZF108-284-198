(products).andO;Product:   Open Access III 3.0 (Computer program).andO;Topic:     Integrated SoftwareEvaluationData Communications.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Software Products InternationalandM;OPEN ACCESS III 3.0andM;The functions available in Open Access are implemented in separate modulesactivated from a menu-driven interface.andP;  The product's design, however, usesthe relational database module as its centerpiece.andP;  This is especially trueof custom-built applications, because the Open Access programming language isprimarily meant for manipulating the database.andM;In addition to the proprietary language, developers can write programs in C.andO;Both kinds of programs can be integrated into the user interface and invokedfrom the menu system.andM;The spreadsheet includes all of the expected calculation and navigationalfacilities, plus an extensive set of statistical-analysis functions beyondthose found in standard spreadsheets.andM;Transferring data between modules is easy, but moving it to and from externalprograms is not as convenient as in other products.andP;  The database module canimport and export data only in DIF files; a separate utility program isprovided for converting dBASE, .DBF and ASCII text files to and from DIF.andM;Similarly, the spreadsheet cannot directly import and export 1-2-3 .WK1files, but requires a separate conversion step.andM;Installation is straightforward, but configuration and running on a networkare cumbersome.andP;  The program must be started from the directory holding theworkstation's configuration files, and the location of the main program filesmust be specified on the command line.andP;  To keep data files out of the currentdirectory, Open Access maintains its own list of paths where it will look fordata files.andM;As expected for a product of this scope, documentation is extensive and quitegood.andP;  An introductory volume explains the basic operation of each component;two reference volumes go into the details of the command sets, theprogramming language and the interface to external C language programs.andP;  Themanuals contain everything that users need to become proficient at using theproduct, and enough for experienced developers to create significantapplications.andM;Software Products International of San Diego can be reached at (619)450-1526.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;For Janet Leinhard, president of Leinhard Consulting Group, a softwareconsulting firm in Bonita, Calif., Open Access III's ability to createdata-entry screens for the database saved considerable time.andM;&quot;When you are creating the database, you not only create the structure, butalso the data-entry screen in one stroke,&quot; she said.andM;Leinhard reported that one of her clients is using Open Access III as adevelopment tool to create a customizable on-line reference manual for itsmanufacturing plant.andP;  When something goes wrong with manufacturing machinery,for example, technicians will have all the reference materials at theirfingertips.andP;  They will also have access to information from other databasesregarding older machinery.andM;&quot;The reason we chose Open Access III over dBASE IV is that OA is integratedso you can transfer data easily,&quot; she said.andP;  Also, Software ProductsInternational offers top-notch support, Leinhard added.andM;&quot;It's really for someone who needs a database and spreadsheet, but [only] asmall word processor,&quot; said Leinhard, adding that the word processor isadequate but not powerful.andM;&quot;Open Access III is more of a true programming language where you have to dostraight programming and coding,&quot; she said.andP;  But, she added, an applicationsgenerator and the ability to do arrays would be helpful additions in a futureversion.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
