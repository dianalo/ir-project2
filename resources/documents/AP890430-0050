(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA on Sunday began replacing twofaulty fuel-system parts aboard space shuttle Atlantis in hope ofmaking another launch attempt as early as Friday.   The launch of the shuttle and its $550 million Magellan Venusprobe was scrubbed on Friday 31 seconds before liftoff because of apower surge on a pump that recirculates liquid hydrogen fuel forone of the shuttle's three main engines.   Engineers later discovered a pinhole leak in a fuel line thatcarries hydrogen from the external fuel tank to the shuttle.   NASA officials Sunday said they would not set a new launch dateuntil Monday. But they said liftoff could not occur before Fridayafternoon.   Because of the positions of Earth and Venus, there is only a32-day launch opportunity ``window'' for sending the Magellanspacecraft toward Venus.   If the shuttle can't get off the ground by May 28, the missionwill have to be put off for two years, at a cost of more than $100million, until Earth and Venus are again in proper alignment.   NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said workers were removing foaminsulation from around both the pump and the hydrogen line andhoped to have a new pump and a new line installed by Mondayy.   After the parts have passed pressure, electrical and othertests, NASA would be ready to restart the countdown, which laststwo days.   ``Right now we don't know when we will pick up the count,''Malone said. ``But we feel comfortable with what we are doing.''   Had the countdown continued on Friday, a computer to detect suchproblems as fuel-line leaks would have stopped the engines fromfiring and the five astronauts would have been safe, the spaceagency said.   Shuttle commander David Walker and pilot Ronald Grabe practicedshuttle landings in a training aircraft Sunday and then flew totheir home base in Houston. Mission specialists Mary Cleave, MarkLee and Norman Thagard returned to Houston on Saturday.   Before returning for another launch attempt, the astronauts willkeep sharp by rehearsing in a simulator.   Six hours after launch the astronauts are to release theMagellan from Atlantis' cargo bay, propelling it on a 450-dayjourney to Venus. The 7,600-pound craft is to orbit the planet andmap up to 90 percent of its cloud-veiled surface withhigh-resolution radar.   The images relayed to Earth could tell scientists much about thehistory of Venus and why it evolved so differently from Earth.</TEXT></DOC>
