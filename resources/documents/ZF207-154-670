Brady, 43, director of the General Services Administration'sComputer Resources Management Division, takes pride in GSA's backbonenetwork.andP;  He brought the system on line in 1984.andM;Because of his foresight in designing the network to comply with theGovernment Open Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP), Brady expects thenetwork to run for a long time to come.andM;However, he said that GSA did not intend to build a large nationwide networkoriginally.andP;  &quot;First we had to automate local processes,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;Once you have a work group, you want to communicate with others.andP;  The powerin the PC today makes it suitable for LANs [local area networks].andP;  There isstill power in the 386 that can't be tapped yet.&quot;andM;In 1985, the GSA backbone network transmitted 60 billion characters annually.andO;By the end of 1988, it was carrying 800 billion characters.andM;The network serves 2,300 GSA users in Washington and in 11 regionallocations, as well as the Federal Supply Service, the Office of Finance, thePublic Building Service and local area networks in regional and centraloffices.andM;The network conforms to GOSIP because, Brady said, &quot;I wanted an investmentthat would last.andP;  We fully implemented the X.25 packet-switching protocolwith high-level data link control.&quot;andM;The network has 24 processors and currently provides connection to 13 DPS8mainframes from Honeywell Inc., two A15Js from Unisys Corp. and one 3955 fromBurroughs Corp., now Unisys.andP;  Three DPS6 Plus minicomputers, also fromHoneywell, act as host processors connected permanently to the network.andM;Brady referred to the 56-kilobit/sec backbone network as &quot;a transparent datahighway&quot; with dedicated digital lines.andP;  Datanet stand-alone networkprocessors from Honeywell determine the communication paths.andM;Network reliability is 99.9 percent, Brady said, because network processorscan reroute data packets over interconnecting routes in case of problems.andM;A number of protocols, including the Kermit file transfer protocol, APTNETand VIP, allow the 2,300 devices served by the network to communicate withone another.andM;Brady often travels to the field to get feedback from customers.andP;  He tellsthem what the system can do and learns the sort of problems they are having.andM;He also conducts management reviews of regional operations.andP;  Brady's divisionconsists of 35 people in Washington and 240 in the regional offices.andM;&quot;The regional customer runs the national system,&quot; Brady said.andP;  GSA's motorpool, for example, has 100,000 cars, vans and trucks.andP;  A networked FleetManagement System has reduced personnel by 200 and cut down on fraud.andM;Not long ago, GSA Customer Supply Centers operated self-service stores foroffice supplies.andP;  Now employees can order supplies by telephone over thenetwork, which tracks buying patterns with an on-line inventory.andM;Estimating productivity gains from any of GSA's automation improvements isdifficult, Brady said, but the total number of employees decreased from29,000 in 1983 to 20,000 in 1989.andM;&quot;The biggest problem is that people ask for services and think it won't costthem,&quot; Brady said.andP;  &quot;Technology has helped, but it puts us at great riskbecause the drive to implement new solutions is faster and faster.andP;  Aninsatiable appetite exists for computer power.andP;  The customers have to rethinkapplications because the network opens up new horizons.&quot;andM;Brady received the GSA administrator's productivity improvement award in1986.andP;  He also particiated in the senior executive fellow program at the JohnF. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.andM;Intuition Pays OffandM;&quot;I found out that things I did intuitively were the right things to do,&quot;Brady said.andM;The backbone network already is in position to receive FTS 2000 services.andO;The system will integrate digital voice, data and video communications.andM;When bandwidth becomes cheaper, Brady expects to be able to justify findingout what is happening hour by hour on the network.andP;  He said he never losessight of the fact that the network is &quot;a reimbursable facility&quot; whereexpenses have to be recovered.andM;He also is looking into the possibility of using fiber optics between GSAsites in San Francisco and Honolulu to eliminate the propagation delayinherent in satellite transmission.andM;After gaining computer experience in the Navy, Brady worked briefly for theCIA and as a contractor for the Army in Vietnam.andM;He moved to GSA in 1973, becoming deputy director of the Computer ResourcesManagement Division in 1979.andP;  He worked at the National Bureau of Standards,now the National Institute of Standards and Technology, from 1980 to 1982 andreturned to GSA in his present position in 1982.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
