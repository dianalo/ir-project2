Utilities and the Department of Energy have initiated a securityprogram to protect the nation's electrical distribution system, but``skepticism was rampant'' among planners that a multi-siteterrorist attack ever would be carried out against U.S. electricfacilities, said Michael R. Gent, president of the North AmericanElectric Reliability Council.   He told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that thedependability and resilience of the nation's energy system ``hasbeen amply demonstrated.''   Gent said hurricanes could cause more damage than terrorists,``and we've shown we can handle hurricanes.''   Another witness before the committee, which was concluding twodays of hearings on the vulnerability of U.S. telecommunications andenergy resources to terrorism, said there had been 283 documentedcases of sabotage against American energy systems since 1980.   But Robert K. Mullen, a terrorism expert, said he saw no evidenceof an increasing terrorist threat in the United States and that mostprevious acts of sabotage have been aimed at individuals who own oroperate service stations or other retail facilities.   ``Very little of what goes on with regard to energy sabotage inpre-industrial nations is comparable to what occurs in the UnitedStates,'' Mullen said in reference to increased sabotage activitiesin other parts of the world.   ``There are no indicators of which I am aware...that wouldsuggest to me the threat to energy assets here is substantiallydifferent from what the recent historical record indicates,'' Mullensaid.   In testimony Tuesday, the committee was told that the increasinghigh-tech nature of the U.S. telecommunications systems and a trendtowards centralization of facilities was making the networks morevulnerable to terrorist attack.   The government is ill-equipped to deal with such attacks, whichcould be carried out with conventional weapons, or even computers,by as few as a half-dozen assailants, a committee investigator saidfollowing a yearlong investigation.   ``In many cases, the consequences appear to be manageable; in afew cases, the consequences are potentially catastrophic,'' CharlesC. Lane, a committee investigator, told a committee hearing.   The Associated Press this week reported that the EnergyDepartment was quietly advising U.S. companies of a growing threatof terrorist attack on vital domestic energy facilities and that itwas pressing them to fortify their defenses.   An internal DOE report obtained by the AP said it was possiblethat potential Third World adversaries ``could sponsor attacks onthe energy infrastructure in the U.S.''   It was learned that a special interagency task force has beencreated within the National Security Council to assess thevulnerability of U.S. energy systems and to study ways of minimizingthe risk of supply disruptions caused by ``techno-terrorism.''   Lane said that while U.S. energy and telecommunications systemsare robust and often redundant, they are vulnerable to multi-siteterrorist attacks. And while the government is prepared to handle amajor national security emergency, ``there are no programs designedspecifically'' to deal with a telecommunications disaster.   The committee hearings are being held to study how well thefederal government and industry are organized to repel attacks andsustain and repair vital energy, telecommunications andtransportation sources.   John C. McDonald, who chaired a National Research Councilcommittee that investigated the vulnerability of the nation'stelecommunications system, told the committee that becauselong-distance networks rely upon ``a very limited number of signaltransfer points, a few well-placed hand grenades would crash majorportions of the domestic long-distance networks.''   But other witnesses were less alarmist about the effects of suchattacks. Benham E. Morriss, deputy manager of the government'sNational Communications System, said he was ``not complacent'' aboutthe dangers, but added: ``I think the statements that have been madeare vastly overstated.''   Morriss acknowledged that the consequences today ofcommunications disruptions can be much greater than in the past,``But I don't think from a national security point of view we'vegotten into a worse situation.''   Thomas A. Norman, representing the recently created NationalSecurity Telecommunications Advisory Committee, said theindustry-government panel did not ``share the degree of concern'' ofthe other witnesses at the hearing.   Norman said the trend to more diversity in the telecommunicationsindustry is good for national security and that technology advancesare ``making detection of troubles and restoration of our networkeven faster than ... in the old days.''   But McDonald said increasing dependence on new technology such asfiber optics and computer software and a trend towardscentralization of facilities increases vulnerability.   He said his committee recommended ``action to make criticalnetwork (facilities) more secure, reduce the concentration ofnetwork traffic and examine ways to provide more diversity intransmission facilities.''   He said the government also should establish additional emergencyplans using simulated disaster and recovery scenarios and should tryto determine means of protecting public networks from ``penetrationby hostile users.''   McDonald said the government has excellent contingency plans fordisasters that cause massive loss of life, but ``when it comes tothe areas of economic disruption or social disruption, we feel thatmore needs to be done.''   Committee Chairman John Glenn, D-Ohio, said he didn't want thegovernment to play ``Big Brother'' and saddle the industry with morerules.   ``But if we see vulnerabilities creeping in, we can't afford tostay out of it ... if we're looking at the national security,''Glenn said.   Lane said an effort is essential ``to identify and initiatemeasures to harden networks to withstand assaults and to make plansto recover services lost as a result of successful attack.''</TEXT></DOC>
