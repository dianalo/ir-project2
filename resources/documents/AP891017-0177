White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the proposedchanges would not alter a longstanding executive order banning U.S.involvement in assassinations but would allow the CIA to havecontact with plotters of a coup in which a foreign leader might bekilled.   ``There's a wide variety of interpretations and issues to bediscussed,'' Fitzwater said.   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate intelligencecommittee, said ``there is some vagueness'' in the policy. He saidhe would welcome a request from Bush to ``clear up any ambiguity.''   The issue took on new urgency in the wake of the failed coupattempt against Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega on Oct. 3.   Administration officials complained that CIA officers in Panamawere essentially prevented from advising the coup plotters becauseof the possibility that Noriega might be killed.   President Bush, at a news conference last week, signaled hewanted to see the restrictions relaxed. ``I want as broad a poweras possible and I think under the Constitution, the president hasit,'' he said last Friday.   Bush said his powers were ``broader than some in the Senate orHouse might think,'' adding, ``I may have a difference with some oninterpreting what the powers of the president might be.''   On Capitol Hill, Sen. William Cohen of Maine, senior Republicanon the Senate intelligence committee, said it may be time to reviewthe interpretation of the executive order on assassinations butthat the order, itself, should not be changed.   ``I don't want to see us getting into the assassination businessby another name,'' Cohen said.   Separately, Boren said he supported giving Bush ``any authoritythat is truly needed to meet his responsibilities as commander inchief.''   Boren said, ``When anybody overthrows a government ... I don'tthink that, by the farthest stretch of the imagination, should becovered.''   U.S. officials are extremely reluctant to publicly discussintelligence matters, particularly subjects such as coups andassassinations. However, CIA Director William H. Webster, in aninterview with The New York Times, openly said he would like to seethe restrictions eased.   Quickly endorsing the comments, Fitzwater said, ``We certainlyare in agreement with everything Judge Webster said yesterday.''   ``What he said was that there are interpretations anddiscussions and understandings with the Hill that should bereconsidered in light of their impact on coup activities,'' thespokesman added.   Webster was quoted as saying he wanted rules devised so that CIAofficers' authority was so clearly defined that ``they can go rightup to the edge of that authority and not worry if they or theiragency is going to get into trouble.''   Webster said that under the current interpretation of theexecutive order, the United States could not devise a plan for theassassination of Noriega or hire an individual or group who wantsto kill him.   ``Now it begins to get a little tighter when you say, `Here's agroup that says it doesn't plan to kill him, but they're going tohave to play rough and it could happen,''' Webster said. ``Nowwe're in the area that has to be addressed.''   Fitzwater confirmed that the administration was discussing thesituation with congressional leaders, but said ``we're not willingto talk about details'' publicly.   However, asked whether he was talking about a situation in whichthe United States would not carry out an assassination but might bea party to a coup that might lead to the death of a foreign leader,Fitzwater said, ``Yes, that's right.''   The executive order prohibiting U.S. involvement inassassination attempts was signed by President Ford in 1976 aftercongressional investigations detailed the CIA's role inassassination plots against Cuban President Fidel Castro and others.   The order was strengthened by President Carter and adoptedwithout change by President Reagan.   Bush invited the leaders of the Senate intelligence committee,Boren and Cohen to the White House last week to stress that hewants to work cooperatively with the panel.</TEXT></DOC>
