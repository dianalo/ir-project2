(BBC) to a stack containinginformation about DNA.andP;  The map to the stack contains a drawing of a doublehelix; users click on parts of the structure to view the drama or interviewsor display illustrations showing the molecular structure of DNA.andM;Other Life Story-type presentations might examine the life and work ofEinstein, Picasso or Gandhi, Florin said.andP;  The DNA presentation was acollaboration between Apple, Lucasfilm and the Smithsonian Institution, butFlorin noted that the Discovery Channel, a cable TV station geared toward theeducational market, is also interested in creating and distributing LifeStory-type presentations.andM;The film and video clips and photographs for each presentation are stored onvideodisc, an optical storage medium.andP;  A videodisc player and video monitorare connected to the Mac and driven by HyperCard.andP;  For the most part, thetechnology driving the presentation is transparent to the viewer.andM;&quot;Let everyone else take care of the technology and we'll take care of thecontent,&quot; said Patricia Hanlon, a teacher at San Francisco's Lowell HighSchool.andP;  She and Robert Campbell, the school librarian, have been workingwith the lab on an interactive multimedia presentation based on JohnSteinbeck's novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot;andM;The presentation combines passage from the novel with information about theDepression, including photographs of murals from San Francisco's Coit Towerdepicting life at the time, a selection of radio programs from the 1930s anda film clip of Franklin D. Roosevelt talking about the nation's poor.andM;&quot;I think one of the important things it does is let the students feel likethey were there,&quot; Hanlon said.andM;In order to keep viewer interest in the presentations high, the lab iscontinually experimenting with design examples.andP;  It has invested between$60,000 and $70,000 on equipment, including scanners, video digitizers, audiodigitizers, 35mm still cameras, CD-ROM players and software such as MacroMindInc.'s Video-Works II animation program.andM;But HyperCard, Florin said, is what makes interactive multimedia possible.andO;&quot;Before HyperCard, there was pretty much nothing in the way of easy-to-useauthoring tools.andP;  I thought maybe I should learn Pascal or Basic, but I was aTV producer, damn it, and didn't want to learn a programming language.&quot;andM;Although there are no set formulas for creating presentations, Florin and thesmall team of designers working on the projects have come up with some rulesof thumb.andP;  &quot;A picture is worth a thousand words, and sound is worth athousand pictures,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;also, a picture is worth nothing if it doesn'thave a caption.&quot;andM;Florin also found that small clusters of pictures about the same subject aremore effective than a single image.andP;  In addition, motion and sound bring textto life, even if just one sound is used.andM;But more importantly, the lab has found that there is a point at which viewerattention wanes no matter what is on the screen.andP;  So the next step is tocreate a system that allows users to cut and past information to create theirown versions of the presentation.andM;&quot;If you can collect things scavenger-style and put it into your ownworkstation, suddenly you're taking that information and making it your own.andO;At that point it becomes not just information,but knowledge,&quot; Florin said.andM;Although the future of interactive multimedia looks bright, Ambron and Florinsee several roadblocks to overcome before multimedia technology moves intothe mainstream.andM;When some of the lab's design examples, including The Grapes of Wrath and theConstitution, will be turned into finished products is a question Apple isnot ready to answer.andM;The company has only recently formed a Business Multimedia Markets Group, ofwhich the lab is now part.andP;  In November 1988, it hosted its first InteractiveMultimedia Developer's Conference.andP;  The three-day event, designed to educatethe Mac community about interactive multimedia, drew more than 700 attendees,half of them Apple employees.andM;For Florin, a central concern is making the technology more accessible to theaverage user.andP;  &quot;The problem is that the market is not there yet, and theplatform for doing these kinds of presentations is not inexpensive enough totake into the home,&quot; he said.andM;According to Ambron, there are several practical considerations.andP;  &quot;We need astandard delivery environment and a single publishing medium.andP;  There are alsocopyright questions when you have a multimedia presentation that incorporatesmusic, video and film from different sources.andP;  The copyright laws are notwritten for this class of materials,&quot; she said.andM;There are also questions as to whether would-be multimedia developersunderstand what they are getting into.andM;&quot;There is an art to this, an artfulness,&quot; Ambron said.andP;  &quot;Some people thinkyou put film, sound and text together and you have a multimedia presentation.andO;It doesn't work that way.andP;  Just because you know how to type and you know thelanguage doesn't mean you can write a book.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
