(HP) LaserJet Series II printer.andP;  Typeset material wasalso scanned, but yielded less acceptable results.andP;  All samples were of goodquality, having excellent contrast between paper and printed letters.andM;When the character-recognition rate of a scan was lower than 95 percent, moretime was needed to correct the scanned-in document than to manually input thetext into the PC.andP;  Even at 95 percent to 98 percent accuracy, the amount ofcorrection needed was still time-consuming.andM;In PC Week testing, for example, an eight-page report, originally printedusing a LaserJet Courier 10 font, took 75 minutes to scan, correct and formatinto a usable form.andP;  Character-recognition accuracy for this document wasbetween 95 and 98 percent.andM;PC Week was able to scan some text samples with 99 percent accuracy, althoughnot consistently.andP;  With any given scanner and text sample, the accuracyvaried from one scan to the next.andM;Moreover, while gross errors in the scanned image, caused by twisting thescanner or scanning too fast, can be seen on-screen prior to activating thetext-recognition software, visually distinguishing between a scan tht wouldachieve 95 percent recognition and one with 99 percent recognition was notpossible.andM;Consequently, users cannot determine whether they should rescan the documentuntil after the text-recognition software process is complete.andM;Even when PC Week achieved scans with 99 percent recognition accuracy, thevarious optical character recognition (OCR) software programs, whichtranslate the scanned images into text, posed further problems.andM;Because of the small size of the scanners, a full-page document must bescanned in at least two pieces.andP;  The OCR software then translates and mergesthese files.andM;In PC Week testing, all of the OCR programs had problems merging thedocuments' files.andP;  For example, if too large or too small an overlap of textwas scanned, no merging occurred.andM;Another problem with these products is attaining high-quality scanned images.andO;Hand-held scanners must be manually dragged across the image, and if themovement is not smooth and straight, distortion will be noticeable in thescanned image.andM;High-quality scanned images are critical in text applications.andP;  If there isany distortion, the OCR software may not recognize the character correctly.andM;The reviewed scanners consist of four elements: the scanner, an interfaceboard, scanning software and OCR software.andP;  Some scanners also includeadditional software, such as paint programs.andM;Most of the OCR programs supplied with the products nsee Specs, Page 84) hadsimilar scanning accuracy.andP;  ECA's A40CR software, however, suffered fromserious limitations, and Genius' Prodigy OCR had many minor bugs.andP;  Theoverall quality of the images scanned with each product was also similar.andM;For buyers willing to endure the potential text-recognition problems thesedevices present, ease of use and the quality of the OCR software are two keypurchasing criteria.andM;Of this group, The Complete Half-Page Scanner/400 was the easiest scanner touse.andP;  While all of the OCR programs tested were lacking, Logitech's ScanManPlus offers the highest-quality OCR software of this bunch.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
