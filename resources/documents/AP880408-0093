ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson said today he has ``sent a messageno one can miss'' to Jewish voters troubled by his past actionswhile a New York Democratic official said he sees ``a clear senseof some movement'' by the state's party hierarchy toward MichaelDukakis.   Jackson, Dukakis and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. canvassed New YorkCity in search of votes in the April 19 primary, which will decidethe breakdown of 255 delegates.   In Manhattan, Jackson would not say whether he has agreed tomeet with Jewish leaders to talk over his 1984 reference to NewYork City as ``Hymietown'' or his call for a Palestinian homeland,but he said, ``We continue to build relationships, we continue toheal relationships.''   He said that he has reached out to all ethnic groups, includingJews. ``Our own commitment is to end any vestiges of racism, ofanti-Semitism, or sexism. ... We've sent a message no one canmiss,'' he said.   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and state party chairman LaurenceKirwan sent a signal to other Democratic officials to line upbehind one of the three Democrats in the race, and not await anendorsement from the governor. Gore and Jackson picked up somesupport, but party executive director John Marino said he thoughtthe Massachusetts governor was the beneficiary.   ``After yesterday, I got a clear sense of some movement toDukakis,'' Marino said today.   A poll released today said Dukakis was the choice of 47 percentof likely Democratic voters, while 31 percent backed Jackson. Gorewas the choice of 6 percent.   The Marist College Institute for Public Opinion questioned 404Democrats Tuesday and Wednesday for the survey which had a marginof error of 5 percentage points. A similar survey conducted by theinstitute in mid-March had Dukakis the choice of 37 percent ofDemocrats and Jackson the pick of 28 percent.   A fourth Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Paul Simon ofIllinois, put his campaign in cold storage on Thursday _ and drewsharp criticism from Jackson for technically remaining in the raceto keep control of the block of 47 at-large delegates he will getas a result of his Illinois primary victory.   If Simon dropped out, those delegates would go to Jackson, whofinished second in Illinois.   ``I would hope that in time Mr. Simon ... now that he has madethe decision to leave the race will leave so honorably, and hidebehind no technicalities to block those as my delegates which infact belong to me,'' said Jackson.   Vice President George Bush, considered a sure bet for theRepublican presidential nomination even by his only remainingrival, Pat Robertson, was heading for Texas to wind up thefund-raising phase of his campaign.   Robertson, who has said he will not campaign in New York,dropped his Secret Service protection on Thursday but an aide saidthe former television evangelist would remain an active candidateup to the GOP convention in New Orleans in August.   Barbara Gattullo said Robertson hoped to bring ``a strongconservative message'' to the convention.   The Democratic candidates crossed paths often in New York,appearing at forums sponsored by the state party and The DemocracyProject, a liberal-oriented group.   They often found it difficult to escape the shadows of Gov.Mario Cuomo and New York City Mayor Ed Koch.   ``Who cares what ... Mario Cuomo says?'' responded Cuomo whenpressed about whether he would endorse one of the contenders.   Cuomo also has advised Gore to tone down criticism of his rivals_ a request seconded by party chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr.   ``I spoke a year ago about the importance of resolving to keepthe debate and the dialogue positive and not involved in anynegative campaigning,'' Kirk said.   ``For the most part, we've been quite successful in that regard.The admonitions that have been addressed to Sen. Gore by Gov. Cuomojust help to make sure we can continue to talk about the issues ina positive way.''   No sooner had Kirk and Cuomo spoken than Gore let loose with afresh attack. He accused the Dukakis campaign of trying to fuel a``stop Jackson'' movement by spreading the word that ``a vote forGore is a vote for Jackson.''   The Dukakis campaign denied that, and Jackson's campaignmanager, Gerald Austin, said Gore has used that strategy himself.   Asked if he would persist in his attacks, Gore said, ``I thinkthere is a legitimate role for drawing a contrast between one'sapproach to the issues, one's experience, one's philosophy ofgovernment and those of one's opponents.''   Koch also was unwilling to heed the admonitions of the governorand party chairman and said Jews would have to be ``crazy'' to votefor Jackson because of his views on Israel.   Jackson brushed aside the remark, saying ``Let us keep thiscampaign above any form of racial or religious bigotry.''   Jackson came under strong criticism in 1984 for his relationshipwith Louis Farrakhan, leader of the National of Islam, a BlackMuslim group. Fahrakahn once described Judaism as a ``gutterreligion.''   Asked what his relationship now is with Farrakhan, Jackson said,``We do not have one. It is precisely that.''</TEXT></DOC>
