San Francisco-based Pacific Gas andamp; Electric won an overall rate increase of 5.9%, representing an increase in revenue of $141 million. A spokesman said the utility requested the increase to compensate for an undercollection of revenue in the past few years because of lower gas sales forecasts.    The commission ordered an 8% rate increase for San Diego Gas andamp; Electric, resulting in an annual revenue increase of $30.7 million to cover the cost of gas it purchases from Southern California Gas. The commission also authorized a $16.4 million refund for overcollected 1987 income taxes, which will result in a one-time credit on June residential energy bills.    Southern California Gas was ordered to lower its rates by 7%, representing a decrease in revenue of $212.3 million a year. A spokesman for Southern California Gas, a unit of Los Angeles-based Pacific Enterprises, said the decrease represents a return to January 1987 rate levels, after rates were increased last year to compensate for a certain undercollection. </TEXT></DOC>
