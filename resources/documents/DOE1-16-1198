It wasfound that interaction of CO with framework OH groups results in theformation of a hydrogen-bonded CO complex whose OH bond frequency isdecreased by 310-320 cm{sup -1} compared with that of free hydroxyls.For the less acidic framework hydroxyls in large cavities of H{sub 70}Na{sub30}-Y zeolite the observed shift is 275 cm{sup -1}. With ZSM-5 zeolites,at least six types of electron-accepting sites are observed originatingfrom nonframework Al species (band of CO in the interaction complex:2132, 2222, 2202, 2195, and 2198 cm{sup -1}) and the Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}microcrystalline phase (CO band at 2153 cm{sup -1}). The CO bond orderscalculated by the CNDO/2 method for the CO interaction complexes withmodels of surface sites increase in the following order: andgt; O-CO andless; andgt; OH-CO{similar_to} {yields} Al-CO {approx} Na-CO andless; alumina-CO {approx} Ca-COandless; {yields} Si-CO andless; Al(cationic)-CO. A correlation between the calculatedbond orders of CO and the observed vibrational frequencies of CO-forminginteraction complexes is drawn.</TEXT></DOC>
