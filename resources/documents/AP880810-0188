Meanwhile, a 12,500-acre fire in Oregon's Deschutes NationalForest was declared 80 percent contained, but not before costingthe state more that $1.5 million.   In Idaho, swirling wind pushed the 12,500-acre Battleaxewilderness fire closer to a backcountry guard station and airstripand forced fire bosses to close the Challis National Forest'sIndian Creek area for safety reasons.   Manpower along the creek was quadrupled as the month-old firecontinued eluding supression.   ``We've been having some squirrelly winds in there and thefire's started to creep around,'' forest spokesman Jim James said.``Our fuels are extra, extra dry.''   In northwestern Idaho, 200 firefighters, including a prisoninmate crew, were gaining control of a 200-acre fire in the NezPerce National Forest.   At Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park, fire managers werecounting on fire retardant and 700-gallon buckets of water to keepa 30,150-acre blaze from scorching a campground in the park'swestern section.   Park officials said visitors to the 288-space Madison Junctioncampground may have to go elsewhere if the North Fork fire movesmuch closer.   Spokesman Joan Anzelmo said winds of 15-25 mph were expected tofan the fire Wednesday afternoon, but the 573 firefighters on theblaze hoped to hold it about three miles from the campground.   Several fires raged in Montana on Wednesday, but the worst hadmore than 200 firefighters battling a potentially explosive blazein the populated, drought-parched Helena National Forest.   The fire raced through 400 to 500 acres of timber within hoursafter it started Tuesday afternoon, despite attacks by a helicopterand four retardant bombers.   ``The biggest problem is that there's a lot of fuel out therethat's very dry,'' said Dave Turner, fire information officer atthe Helena Interagency Fire Dispatch Center. `Seven or eight yearsago some late spring storms took down a lot of material, trees thatare now on the ground.   ``Some local residents in the upper end of Warm Springs Creekdrainage are at risk at the present time,'' Turner said, addingthat crews did not yet expect to evacuate them.   The largest forest fire in Oregon this year was 80 percentcontained Wednesday.   The Paulina fire has cost $1.57 million to fight so far, saidJill Haney, a Forest Service spokeswoman. It consumed 12,500 acres.   A shift in winds and higher humidity helped crews slow thespread of the fire.</TEXT></DOC>
