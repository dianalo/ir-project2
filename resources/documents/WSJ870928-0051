After all, he created the first successful vaccine against polio. So when New York deal maker Morton Davis sought private financing for a new AIDS vaccine company built around Dr. Salk's work, money rained down from the heavens. &quot;We had to send back checks,&quot; Mr. Davis says.    These days, AIDS itself has star quality with investors. Its appeal is reminiscent of the now-cooled ardor money men had for the microchip businesses of Silicon Valley.    Venture capitalists are pouncing on all manner of AIDS enterprises, lavishing millions on private projects to diagnose, treat, prevent or cure the disease.    Dr. Salk's company, Immune Response Corp. of La Jolla, Calif., is but one of a score of new AIDS-related ventures. The interest is international and involves wealthy individuals as well as traditional venture-capital firms.    The British company, Biotechnology Investments Ltd., under the chairmanship of Lord Rothschild has backed nine public and five private companies in the field. British press lord Robert Maxwell, the publisher of Mirror Newspaper Group and head of a huge AIDS fund-raising effort in England, is courting prominent American research scientists. Nissin Food Products of Japan, best known as the maker of Top Ramen noodles, is financing the development of an anti-viral drug and is building a 10 billion yen ($70 million) biotechnology institute.    The AIDS epidemic, which has already killed more than 24,000 people in the U.S. and profoundly altered the sexual revolution, is a major force behind a general boom in biomedical enterprises. &quot;There's a frenzy around medical ventures now, especially since the semiconductor industry downturn,&quot; says Larry Bock, a partner in Fairfield Venture Partners of Costa Mesa, Calif. &quot;And AIDS is one of the largest markets.&quot;    &quot;Almost every business plan I pick up has A-I-D-S on it,&quot; says Nelson Schneider, of T.E.I. Partnership, a venture firm in Washington, D.C. Many financiers report an avalanche of prospectuses describing some new company's business plan for a drug, a vaccine or a test.    AIDS draws money to private research in much the way interferon did a few years ago. But when interferon, a protein touted as a cure-all, proved useful against only one or two rare cancers, some companies got caught in the downdraft of waning investor support. Some of the profit-oriented AIDS ventures will surely fail, too.    Typically, a third of all new research ventures fail, a third scrape by, and a third make money. In AIDS, the odds against success may be especially great. The scientific challenge is complex. Ventures must woo talent away from prestigious government and university jobs. And any new product must clear the hurdle of clinical trials, as well as patent and regulatory problems. Finally, of the AIDS companies now being formed, &quot;some are sound and some are scams,&quot; says Cynthia Robbins-Roth, the publisher of the newsletter BioVenture View.    &quot;I don't know how much it will take to cure AIDS, but it's not your {usual} $6 million start-up,&quot; says John Wilkerson, who heads the Wilkerson Group, a New York consulting firm. &quot;There will be a few people with the right molecule and some dollars. But we need much more for victory.&quot; The AIDS virus lies latent, it mutates, and it attacks many cell-types and organ systems. All of that worsens the odds against success for drugs.    Development of a drug therapy can cost at least $20 million; a vaccine, $50 million. &quot;It's going to mean megabucks. Anyone not willing to spend $50 million isn't even in the race,&quot; says Henry Weinert of Boston Biomedical Consultants. Taking a drug to market can consume $100 million. Even AZT, a 20-year-old compound that had major research support from the National Institutes of Health, is said by manufacturer Burroughs-Wellcome Co. to have cost $80 million for facilities, testing and manufacturing. Which is why AIDS patients are asked to pay as much as $10,000 a year for this, the most expensive medicine in history.    With the stakes so high, the money men look to hedge their bets by financing well-tested, versatile technologies that are likely to have applications to other diseases as well as to AIDS. &quot;I don't buy the extract-of-marvelous-mixtures approach,&quot; says one financier. &quot;I look for a rational scientific basis to it.&quot;    Take, for instance, Amnion Inc. of Woodlands, Texas, near Houston. Amnion licensed from Baylor College of Medicine a blood-recycling machine to reduce the need for transfusions during surgery. The BRAT (or Baylor Rapid Autologous Transfusion) device has been clinically tested for three years to keep patients from contracting hepatitis or AIDS from transfused blood. The company could command up to half of a $100 million-a-year market for blood-recycling apparatus. Such prospects helped attract about $6 million in venture capital from a group led by the Woodlands Venture Capital Company, of Woodlands, Texas.    BRAT may have other uses, but, as Amnion's president Don Spyrison puts it, BRAT's market &quot;is driven by AIDS.&quot;    Similarly, Idec Inc. of La Jolla, Calif., tapped a technology that is promising both for AIDS and for non-AIDS cancers: &quot;anti-idiotype&quot; antibodies, a kind of magic bullet composed of a protein that mimics a foreign cell or microbe, blocking its invasion or rallying the body's defenses. Idec also tapped into $7 million in venture financing from a group that includes Kleiner Perkins Caufield andamp; Byers, the company that financed Genentech Inc. Testing these molecules against AIDS in human beings could begin by 1989.    Idec needs $20 million more to develop its anti-idiotypes, and for this &quot;we're going to need a corporate partner,&quot; says Brook Byers, a general partner at Kleiner Perkins.    Other young companies that already have found powerful allies include: HEM Research, whose work on the AIDS drug Ampligen is backed by Du Pont Co.; Repligen, a vaccine developer that teamed up with Merck andamp; Co., and Cellular Products, a diagnostics company backed by Eastman Kodak.    Money aside, the wooing of scientists can be critical to the success of these ventures. And some early contacts turn out like bad blind dates. Jerome Groopman, a prominent AIDS researcher at Harvard University and New England Deaconess Hospital, says he has been approached about joining companies by at least six venture capitalists. &quot;That's just little old me,&quot; he says. &quot;Imagine what it's like for other research stars?&quot; Robert T. Schooley, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital, was approached by ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. &quot;I said, 'Thanks for lunch, and good luck,'&quot; he says.    Some venture capitalists hold scientific beauty contests. Kevin Kinsella, a managing partner of Avalon Ventures of La Jolla, Calif., interviewed 500 brain experts before picking a management team for Athena Neurosciences Inc., a San Carlos, Calif., company developing ways to get drugs to the brain in AIDS dementia and Alzheimer's disease patients.    Other partnerships involve love at first sight. Moshe Alafi of Alafi Capital says he shuns many AIDS business plans that cross his desk but couldn't resist when &quot;my friend, Harvard Medical School Prof. Fred Goldberg, said: 'Moshe, let me introduce you to the most talented post-docs who ever came through Harvard.'&quot;    The post-doctoral students he was referring to are Nancy Chang and her husband, Tse Wen, who had developed a monoclonal antibody to the AIDS virus, a substance derived from a single cell that attacks a specific antigen or foreign protein. They impressed Mr. Alafi with &quot;good virology, elegant publications and the venture-capital spirit. The people are so dedicated, they practically sleep {at the lab},&quot; he says.    The feeling was mutual, says Mrs. Chang. &quot;Having Mr. Alafi is a dream come true. He's an angel, not only financially but in terms of {management} expertise,&quot; she says.    It wasn't just vaccine technology, but also great fame that attracted Morton Davis of the securities firm D.H. Blair andamp; Co. to Jonas Salk. &quot;He's a genius, a leader in immunology,&quot; says Mr. Davis, who put up $1 million of his own money and now owns part -- he won't say how much -- of the company, Immune Response. The second phase of financing -- raising $2.5 million -- was so successful it drew twice that amount from eager investors.    Despite the examples of Dr. Salk and Mrs. Chang, many scientists won't go corporate for complex reasons of pride and principle.    Researchers now fighting AIDS from prestigious university and government posts fear they might lose their scientific objectivity and do harm to their reputations. A corporate post, while lucrative, might lessen their influence, they fear. And their ideas would be harnessed to the work of just one company.    Others are hostile to ostentatious overtures from venture capitalists. &quot;His cuff links were worth more than my house,&quot; one scientist said after hearing a financier's pitch. &quot;I wanted to wash my hands.&quot; A free dinner at Lutece gives some scientists spiritual indigestion. Said one: &quot;Do they think I can be bought by a fancy meal?&quot;    Dani Bolognesi, a prominent AIDS vaccine researcher at Duke University, is frankly suspicious of profit-oriented research: &quot;I don't know if it's such a good deal for a scientist, unless he's hell-bent on making money. Or unless the deal is big enough and it's money without strings. Then you don't have to apply for grants. Good people aren't going to sacrifice their careers to plunge into a profit-making scheme.&quot;    A scientist lured away to a private undertaking can generally count on at least a 50% raise in pay, plus stock options and other perks. So far, private enterprise hasn't won over the most prominent scientists, Robert C. Gallo or Luc Montagnier, from their respective perches at the National Institutes of Health and the Pasteur Institute. But some capitalists are picking up what they can anyway from the research stars.    Two Wall Street financiers, David and Isaac Bleck, recently attended Dr. Gallo's annual lab meeting -- an esoteric scientific summit. The brothers won't tell what plans they might have. But Wall Street competitors say they believe the Blecks are building a $100 million war chest against AIDS, with big backing from insurance companies.    Venture capitalists face another problem: scientific controversy. As the sense of national urgency increases -- and desperate people seek remedies in everything from aloe vera to a touted &quot;magic tea&quot; -- hot debates have arisen.    One of the more animated disputes surrounds the research -- and now the venture -- of Candace Pert. Dr. Pert of the National Institute of Mental Health fervently believes the protein Peptide-T in a vaccine or a drug can block the receptor site of the AIDS virus, thus preventing infection. But the work polarized the International Conference on AIDS in Washington last June, before a single American patient had received it. Scientists at Harvard and Genentech say Peptide-T doesn't work in the test tube, while another group at Bristol-Myers Co.'s Genetic Systems unit in Seattle say they have confirmed Dr. Pert's claims for the stuff.    In any event, controversy didn't discourage Hillman Ventures Inc. of Pittsburgh from bankrolling Dr. Pert's protein. The firm put up $3 million and plans to double its investment. The deal entailed setting up a foundation, and Dr. Pert will be able to spend half her time on basic research. But Philip Paul, the chairman of Hillman Ventures, says Dr. Pert is ensconced in no ivory tower: &quot;We're trying to drive this product toward a market.&quot;    For her part, Dr. Pert will say only that she is &quot;working very hard on Peptide-T,&quot; which recently got the green light from the FDA to start human tests in the U.S.    Another controversial business plan is that of DSW Laboratories, created and given $1.5 million by Burr, Egan Deleage andamp; Co., a venture capital firm.    Its goal: to set up screening centers and outpatient clinics with the eventual aim of selling experimental AIDS therapies. The FDA has a new policy that permits that, but it is revolutionary. Heretofore, experimental drugs always have been provided free of charge. (Jean Deleage says he is sensitive to ethical questions, and he has hired a high-powered former FDA counsel as his regulatory consultant.)    A couple of other new ventures are still backed solely by their founders. Mikromed Screening of Tucson, Ariz., wants to market a home test-kit for AIDS. The company expected swift FDA approval but was told by the agency that it will face the tough scrutiny given medical devices. &quot;We're confident that, once we have clearance, it'll do well,&quot; says Robert H. Berg, Mikromed's president. &quot;If it doesn't, I'll lose a lot of money.&quot;    Viro Research International Inc., of Laguna Beach, Calif., will market cleansers, soaps and towelettes spiked with nonoxynol-9, a spermicide that has been shown to kill the AIDS virus, at least in the test tube. Never mind the current scientific consensus that special cleaning preparations aren't going to do much for people who are risking AIDS through sex or injecting drugs. (The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends washing with plain soap and using chlorine bleach as a disinfectant.) Viro's founder, Geraldine Dettmer, says she isn't pandering to fear in devising her products; she is merely trying to supply &quot;that extra measure of protection.&quot;    Even if venture capitalists stick to mainstream science and conventional wisdom, they still must move fast to make a deal. MicroGeneSys Inc., a vaccine developer in West Haven, Conn., recently burst forth from obscurity to get FDA approval for the first human trial of an AIDS vaccine. The company quickly completed its fund raising and now has amassed about $10 million.    Euphoric investors who rushed in to back the deal will now have to sit back and wait for a miracle, a successful vaccine against the AIDS scourge that will also turn a dollar.    ---            The New Crop of AIDS-Related Companies PRODUCT                 FINANCE SOURCE*    Amnion Inc.
