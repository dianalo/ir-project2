Neither the official Tass news agency or Radio Moscow'sinternational service on Thursday mentioned the reporteddisturbances on the main square of Vilnius.   Valdas Analauskas, a correspondent with the dissident journalExpress-Chronicle, said a prosecutor refused to file chargesagainst those arrested during a demonstration Wednesday and anovernight hunger strike on Gediminas Square.   Most of those arrested were released Thursday, but a large crowdgathered around the courthouse where the remaining 20 people wereto be tried in a closed court session, Analauskas reported.Instead, the 20 were released.   At least 5,000 people gathered on the square Thursday night,carrying the flag of the independent Lithuanian republic andbanners reading ``Shame on the police,'' he said. A lunch-timegathering also drew thousands, he reported.   Nine Lithuanian activists declared a hunger strike Wednesdaynight and remained on the square all night after police broke up aprotest earlier that day with armored personnel carriers and rubbertruncheons, Analauskas said.   About 20 sympathizers had gathered around the hunger strikers,and dozens of police waded into the crowd, beating, kicking andpulling hair, Analauskas said. The demonstrators were forced intotwo buses and driven away, he said.   Analauskas estimated that up to 30 people were taken intocustody Thursday morning following earlier arrests.   The initial protest Wednesday was against Soviet control ofLithuania, one of three Baltic republics absorbed by the SovietUnion in 1940. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia had been independentcountries from shortly after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution until1940.   On Aug. 23, thousands of people gathered in the three republicsto protest the 1939 non-aggression pact between the Soviet Unionand Nazi Germany that divided Eastern Europe into spheres ofinfluence and led to the Soviet takeover of the Baltics.   Baltic activists are seeking more economic and politicalfreedom. Some are demanding outright independence from the SovietUnion.   Analauskas said some protesters threw stones at police Wednesdaynight.</TEXT></DOC>
