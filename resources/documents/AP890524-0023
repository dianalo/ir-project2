Bell hasbeen named by a special Exxon Corp. legal committee to head aninvestigation into the Alaskan oil spill, according to publishedreports.   Bell's task will be to try to determine responsibility for thenation's worst oil spill and recommend to Exxon's board whetherlawsuits should be filed against former or current Exxon officials,the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.   ``I'm going to interview everyone who knows anything about thespill,'' the Journal quoted Bell as saying.   ``It will be very exciting and very challenging,'' he said in aninterview published Wednesday in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.``We're going to get to the bottom of everything ... to make aninvestigation of everything and (make a recommendation) as to whatought to be done for the best interest of the shareholders.''   Bell's investigation is expected to begin in about three weeksand include questioning of Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl, whosaid he would cooperate.   Bell said up to eight lawyers could eventually be involved inthe probe.   The tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on March 24 and spilled 10.9million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound.   Exxon says it has spent nearly $100 million trying to clean upthe oil that has stained hundreds of miles of Alaska's southerncoastline and killed thousands of animals.   Exxon's board set up the three-member committee of outsidedirectors after receiving letters from shareholders' attorneyscalling for such a probe.   Bell, who was attorney general in President Jimmy Carter'sadmininstration, in 1985 conducted a similar inquiry into acheck-kiting scandal at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. Bell found that seniormanagers weren't involved.   Hutton eventually pleaded guilty to 2,000 counts of check-kitingand agreed to pay $2.75 million in fines and legal fees.   In other legal preparations, Alaska has hired a prominentUniversity of Georgia law professor to help represent the state inits expected lawsuit against Exxon.   Thomas J. Schoenbaum, director of the university's Dean RuskCenter for International Law, joins the Alaska attorney general'soffice and a an Alaskan law firm.   Schoenbaum said he was hired about 10 days ago and will travelto Alaska in about two weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
