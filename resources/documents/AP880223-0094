The FBI's executive assistant director, Oliver B. Revell, camebefore a Senate panel to defend the probe of the Committee InSolidarity with the People of El Salvador. The probe was endedwithout any charges being filed.   The group has said it was investigated because it opposesPresident Reagan's Central America policies.   Documents previously released in the March 1985-June 1985 probeshow that FBI agents and informants sent to spy on CISPES collectedso much information on peaceful protest activities that bureauheadquarters was worried that the investigation had gone too far.   The documents, released under the Freedom of Information Act,have shown that while the investigation was targeted at CISPES, thefiles eventually included information on hundreds of otherindividuals and groups, ranging from Roman Catholic nuns to unionleaders who opposed Reagan policies.   In defending the probe, Revell told the Senate IntelligenceCommittee that in addition to possible violence, CISPES wasinvolved in circulating forged U.S. documents and had strong tiesto the U.S. communist party.   ``Some have insinuated that this investigation was politicallymotivated as many individuals associated with CISPES were opposedto Reagan administration policies in Central America,'' Revellsaid. ``Nothing could be further from the truth.   ``We did find indications that some CISPES members were at leastdiscussing and planning violence. Our investigtions uncovered oneCISPES member who was tasked to determine response times ofemergency services in a major American city; another CISPES memberstated he had developed a system to shut down a public utility in amajor midwestern city; as well as plans to violently disrupt the1984 Republican convention.''   The bureau initiated the investigation under foreignintelligence and counter-intelligence guidelines, designed toprotect the United States against crimes such as espionage andterrorism, in which foreign powers or groups are involved.   These guidelines allow the FBI to focus more on politicallyoriented groups and their missions than on specific crimes that areplanned or carried out. Because of this wider latitude, somelawmakers and the American Civil Liberties Union warn that it iseasy to cross the line and investigate free speech and peacefulassembly.   FBI Director William S. Sessions said the investigation in thiscase ``was predicated on information received from several sourcesthat certain leaders and key members of CISPES were involved incovertly furnishing funds and materials to a foreign terroristorganization.'' The group was identified as the FMLN, the groupfighting a war against the U.S.-backed government of El Salvador.   Jerry Berman, chief legislative counsel for the American CivilLiberties Union, said the investigation should have started underthe most strict guidelines, those for general criminalinvestigations.   These investigations can only begin ``when facts orcircumstances reasonably indicate that a federal crime has been, isbeing, or will be committed.'' If the crime has already beencommitted, the probe focuses on who committed the act and onsecuring evidence.   The FBI is given greater leeway for a domestic ``intelligence''investigation, which can focus on groups in the United Statestrying ``to further political or social goals through activitiesthat involve criminal violence.''   The bureau did not place the CISPES investigation under eitherthe intelligence or general guidelines, but under the foreignintelligence and counter-intelligence rules that involveparticipation by foreign entities.   These rules remain largely classified, but officials familiarwith them say they provide the widest latitude among the differentsets of guidelines.   On July 26, 1984 _ some 16 months after the investigation began_ FBI headquarters sent 32 field offices a message that suggestedsome of them were going beyond the guidelines.   ``Some offices have reported information recently regardingpolitical statements and political lobbying by CISPES or CISPESaffiliates,'' it said. ``Supervisors in recipient offices mustcarefully monitor this and related investigations and assetoperations within your respective divisions to ensure appropriatedirection, targeting and reporting.''   But messages from the field showed that bureaus were stillconfused.   In August 1984 the Denver office told headquarters, ``the fieldis still not sure of how much seemingly legitimate politicalactivity can be monitored.''   And prior to the July directive, FBI headquarters receivedmessages like this one from Cincinnati: ``The bureau is requestedto furnish Cincinnati with guidelines regarding investigation ofcaptioned matter, vis-a-vis religious organizations _ specificallythe Roman Catholic Church.''   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House Judiciarycivil rights subcommittee, said he does not fault the FBI forstarting the investigation under foreign intelligence guidelines,but for ``a management problem'' in not shutting it down muchsooner.   ``We want it narrow, and stopped when criminal conduct is notfound,'' he said in an interview. ``The CISPES investigation wenton for years and there was no criminal conduct. Somebody shouldhave blown the whistle.''   Berman, of the ACLU, said the field offices became ``a vacuumcleaner for collection of First Amendment activity.''   ``They never began to narrow it,'' he said. ``They ended upsweeping up the First Amendment activity and broadly targetingCISPES all over the country.''</TEXT></DOC>
