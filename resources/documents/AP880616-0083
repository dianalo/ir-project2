Five tornadoes, meanwhile, spun through Colorado, hurlingvehicles through the air and injuring seven people.   Temperatures reached the 80s in many areas of the East andMidwest by late morning. At Louisville, Ky., the mercury rose from83 degrees at 11 a.m. to 85 some 40 minutes later. OutsideBaltimore, it was 85 degrees at 11 a.m. with 67 percent relativehumidity. Boston was even hotter, recording 88 degrees.   ``Have you seen the movie `Good Morning Vietnam?' Robin Williamshas a line in there that sums it up: `Hot, damn hot, hot andwet,''' said Frank Ackerman, spokesman for the Cape Cod NationalSeashore in Wellfleet, Mass.   An estimated 196,000 people jammed beaches Wednesday in the NewYork City area as the temperature hit 96 degrees, tying a97-year-old record. It reached 98 in Boston, exceeding by 2 degreesthe record set in 1956.   The bodies of an elderly woman and her daughter were found todayin their Boston apartment. A preliminary investigation indicatedthe women died because of the heat, said police spokeswoman JillReilly.   In Massachusetts and Rhode Island the miserable weather becamean official heat wave, meaning at least three straight days oftemperatures at 90 or higher, the National Weather Service said.   Kent County Memorial Hospital in Warwick, R.I., reported anincrease of people coming in with chest pains.   ``We've had a lot of chest pains, which I'm sure areprecipitated by the heat,'' nursing supervisor Gertrude Bollengiersaid today. She said no cases of heat exhaustion had shown up yet.Rhode Island Hospital in Providence and Newport Hospital officialsreported no increase in heat-related illnesses.   The unrelenting heat prompted Rhode Island Public TransitAuthority bus drivers to threaten a walkout over broken airconditioners, as highs in Providence on Wednesday reached 97degrees, one degree below the 1945 record.   ``It's more than uncomfortable,'' said Edward Rodgers, presidentof the drivers' union. ``It's a safety issue. What if a driverpassed out? ... It could be a catastrophe.''   In Colorado, thunderstorms spawned five tornadoes in an area 55miles long from north to south, tossing vehicles and storage shedsthrough the air and tearing off several roofs. Seven people wereinjured, none seriously.   One twister hit near Denver's Stapleton International Airport,where the air traffic control tower was evacuated for about 25minutes, Stapleton spokesman Richard Bouleware said.   Much of the property damage involved uprooted trees, lostshingles and broken windows, rather than destruction of homes,officials said.   To the east, the severe heat is being caused by a high-pressuresystem off the mid-Atlantic Coast pumping in hot air from the southcentral part of the country, National Weather Service meteorologistMike Wyllie said.   ``Over hundreds and hundreds of miles, the ground is very, verydry,'' said Peter Lamb of the Illinois State Water Survey. ``Sowhat the sun is doing is heating the ground and the ground isheating the air.''   The heat, coming in the wake of a dry winter and spring in thenation's midsection, aggravated widespread drought conditions thathave threatened farm yields, sending prices rocketing on commodityexchanges.   Efforts to cool off put extraordinary pressure on municipalwater and utility systems, and some communities began orderingconservation. The heat, however, has not hurt the air conditioningbusiness.   ``Sales have been going berserk,'' said Jack Van Horne, owner ofArundel Cooling and Heating Co. Inc. in Linthicum, Md., nearBaltimore. ``When a heat wave moves in and units break down, peoplewant service and all hell breaks.''</TEXT></DOC>
