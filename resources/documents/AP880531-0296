The village Native corporation, Kootznoowoo Inc., rented anempty building in town, trained a dozen new employees and went towork this spring building IBM-compatible computers from importedcomponents.   Almost 50 units have been produced at the plant, which has totempoles in front and high-tech electronic gear inside. Federalagencies and corporations have been the main customers, but aretail shop two blocks from the state Capitol also offers thecomputers to the public.   ``The Kootznoowoo board of directors has had a policy of tryingto promote economic development in Angoon,'' said Ron Hawk,controller of the corporation's computer subsidiary. ``Electronicsimmediately came to the top of the list.''   ``The electronics industry is an industry you can add a lot ofvalue to and not pay a lot of freight,'' Hawk said.   Electronic parts don't weigh much and that holds down freightcosts for the company's operation on an island more than 800 milesnorth of Seattle. Environmental concerns also played a part in thedecision. ``Anything having to do with electronics is a cleanindustry,'' Hawk said.   Angoon, a village of about 600 people on Admiralty Island in theTongass National Forest, is 60 miles south of the state capital atJuneau. Freight from the Lower 48 must come first to Juneau andthen move by barge, boat or plane to Angoon.   Kootznoowoo Inc. was established under the 1971 Alaska NativeClaims Settlement Act, which distributed money and land to AlaskaNatives to settle claims against the federal government. The actestablished 13 regional and about 200 village corporations tomanage the property.   Kootznoowoo's nearly 700 shareholders are Tlingit Indians,two-thirds of whom still live on Admiralty, an island almost 80times the size of Manhattan. The corporation's assets totaled $33million as of the end of the past fiscal year.   Kootznoowoo is the Tlingit word for Admiralty. It translates to``Fortress of the Bears,'' in reference to the island's largepopulation of brown bear.   Alaska Native corporations have gone into construction, mining,timber, seafood, real estate and oil exploration services, but thisis the first venture into computers, Hawk said.   As far as he has been able to determine from federal officials,Kootznoowoo is the first Indian corporation in the country toassemble computers. The Bureau of Indian Affairs has purchasedseveral of the computers, and an order is expected soon from theU.S. Public Health Service.   Timber is the company's only other business, Hawk said, althoughthe board is looking at entering the tourism and seafood processingindustries.   The corporation a year ago established Kootznoowoo GovernmentServices Inc. as a subsidiary to develop new businesses and jobsfor its shareholders. As its first venture, KGS this winter leasedan empty 1,800-square-foot building from the city for use as acomputer assembly plant.   The building was put up six years ago for use as a museum, butthe city never had money to operate it and it sat empty for fiveyears.   ``If we had to factor in the cost of building a plant, weprobably never would have considered the idea,'' Hawk said. Thebuilding was constructed with humidity, temperature and dustcontrols to protect artifacts _ making it perfect for electronicswork.   KGS President Ed Gamble said 30 people applied when the companyadvertised in the village for computer assembly jobs. A dozenpeople were hired and trained, the building remodeled, and thefirst 12 computers were built, all for a start-up cost of a littleover $20,000, Gamble said.   Kootznoowoo Inc. provided $50,000 as an initial line of creditfor its subsidiary, Gamble said. Additional money was contributedlater.   ``Memory chips are getting very expensive,'' Hawk said. Aworldwide microchip shortage has driven up prices, and althoughKootznoowoo is physically isolated from Silicon Valley, it facesthe same market pressures as the rest of the industry.   The company offers two models, marketed under the names KGSWolf-AT and Wolf-386.   The computers are named in honor of the late corporationpresident, Ivan Gamble Sr., who died last year in a trafficaccident. He was a member of the Wolf clan and his Indian namemeant ``Wolf who cries in the wilderness.''   Although KGS employees assemble the computers, the monitors andkeyboards are purchased intact. Hawk said the company couldassemble those items, too, if it had enough sales volume to justifythe expansion.   The KGS building has room for 20 work stations. ``It is designedso that one person does all the assembly of the machine,'' Hawksaid, rather than operating as an assembly line.   If expectations of federal contracts, corporate purchases andincreased retail sales come true, the company hopes for sales of100 units a month by the end of the year. ``Our main focus has beengovernment offices in the Lower 48,'' he said.   Production of 100 units a month would result in annual revenuesexceeding $2 million _ not even a nick out of IBM's blue chipstock, but big business for a village of 600 people.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions June 4-5</NOTE></DOC>
