That closure was announced on December 29,1988, as part of a comprehensive package prepared by the Defense Secretary'sCommission on Base Realignments and Closures. On January 5, 1989, the Secretaryof Defense accepted the Commission's recommendations.The EIS process has been modified by Pub. L. 100-526, section 204(c) (1)and (2) which provides that the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)does not apply to the actions of the Commission or to the Secretary ofDefense's acceptance of the Commission's recommendations. This means thatthe decision to close Mather AFB has already occurred and is outside thescope of the EISs being announced today. One of the EISs being announcedtoday is an implementation EIS, focused on the potential closure impactstaking place at Mather AFB. Its purpose is to help the Air Force intelligentlycease operations. It will analyze the local environmental effects causedby the closure and the measures necessary to implement the closure. Itwil also develop appropriate mitigation measures. The Air Force hopes tohave the EIS associated with base closure completed by early 1990.Implementing the closure involves moving active Air Force units from MatherAFB to other bases. The environmental impacts to Mather AFB caused by thedeparture of those units, except the previously programmed force structureaction to relocate 14 B-52Gs, are within the scope of this EIS. The B-52Gswill be assessed in a separate NEPA document with the cumulative impactbeing addressed in this EIS. However, the environmental impacts causedby the arrival of those units at the new locations are <T3>not</T3> part of this EIS; those impacts will be analyzed in separateNEPA documents focusing on impacts and issues at the various receivingbases.The other EIS will cover the final disposition of the facilities and theAir Force Reserve KC-135 Squadron at Mather AFB. If local authorities donot elect to operate Mather AFB as an airport, then the Air Force Reserveunit will be relocated to McClellan AFB, located 10 miles away. This processalso involves laws and community issues quite different from the comparativelystraightforward steps involved in closure (i.e. halting operations andremoving equipment and personnel). Althought the Air Force is only in therudimentary stages of considering disposal proposals, the scoping processis beginning at this time because the Air Force desires to solicit communitycomments at the earliest opportunity.The Air Force will conduct a public scoping meeting to obtain public input.This input will assist in determining the nature, extent and scope of theissues and concerns to be addressed in the EISs. The public scoping meetingwill be held on February 27, 1989 at 7:30 in Cordova High School Auditorium,2239 Chase Drive, Rancho Cordova, CA. The scoping process may also includeother meetings with local officials, either before or after the publicmeeting. In addition, anyone may write to the Air Force with comments onthe scope of the EISs. To assure the Air Force will have sufficient timeto consider public input on issues to be included in the EISs, commentsshould be forwarded to the addressee listed below by March 27, 1989.After scoping and analysis of the closure process, the Air Force may findthat the environmental impacts are insufficient to justify preparationof the EISs. If so, the Air Force would prepare environmental assessmentsand Findings of No Significant Impact. Both documents would be publiclyannounced and publicly available.For further information concerning the EIS, contact: Lt. Col.
