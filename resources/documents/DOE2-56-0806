Thesefilms were superconducting in an as-deposited state. Films depositeddirectly on silicon and films with a MgO buffer layer differed in theirsuperconducting properties. Films with a MgO layer showed higher criticaltemperatures (70 K) and higher critical currents (3 x 10{sup 3} A/cm{sup2} at 31 K) than films deposited directly on Si. Depth profiling by Augerand x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy has been employed to study the diffusionand structural variation near the interface.</TEXT></DOC>
