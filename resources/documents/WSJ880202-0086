Unfortunately, Dynapac's Intercon Network Bingo, a proposed television game, failed to incite &quot;bingo mania&quot; throughout the land. The company's Golden Gulch Mine didn't yield any gold, either. In fact, criminal prosecutors in New Mexico allege it was a &quot;sham mining operation,&quot; jury-rigged to hoodwink investors.    The Securities and Exchange Commission charged in a civil suit that Dynapac's chairman, Maurice Edward Barbara, and others defrauded more than 3,000 investors in a multimillion-dollar stock scam by greatly inflating the company's over-the-counter stock price through misleading press blurbs and ads. Mr. Belli, who was a Dynapac director, wasn't charged. He says that his 1984 letter was misused and that he is a victim, having lost at least $300,000 on Dynapac himself. The 54-year-old Mr. Barbara denies swindling anybody.    Flagrant fraud, securities officials say, pervades the market for 11,000 or more fitfully traded stocks listed in the Pink Sheets, published daily by the National Quotation Bureau. &quot;The more you look, the more scams you find,&quot; says Daniel Harris, an SEC attorney in San Francisco. But regulators have neither the manpower nor the surveillance system to do much checking. Critics call the Pink Sheet market a regulatory black hole.    For most promoters, the preferred scam is &quot;pump and dump&quot; -- pump up the per-share price with hot air and hype, then dump the stock on duped investors for immense profits. Usually, they are in league with rogue brokers who, for a cut of the illicit take, tout the stock in sales pitches and create an artificial market for it.    The Pink Sheet stocks include thousands of legitimate securities. But &quot;because this market operates in the shadows, there is a great temptation for unethical people to rip off the public,&quot; says Terry Freeman, the publisher of the National OTC Stock Journal, a Denver-based investment weekly, though he says their misdeeds &quot;pale in comparison to the damages unleashed by rule-breakers in the biggest markets.&quot;    Pink Sheet stock fraud once was considered a regional aberration, confined mostly to the penny-stock centers of Denver, Salt Lake City and Spokane. But now it is a &quot;national problem and a serious one,&quot; says Gary Lynch, the enforcement director at the SEC, which is pursuing several investigations of Pink Sheet manipulations.    Some scams are detected serendipitously. In 1986, Sam Sarcinelli, a hustler known to flit around in Learjets and deal with mobsters, was convicted by a federal judge in Chicago on cocaine-peddling and tax-evasion charges. In going through Mr. Sarcinelli's files, federal prosecutors chanced upon evidence that he also had been a key player in a Pink Sheet stock manipulation by a group of since-convicted swindlers whose watchword was, &quot;If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.&quot;    Jack Ringer, a New York stock promoter, had recruited Mr. Sarcinelli to buy the outstanding shares of European Auto Classics Ltd., a now-defunct Great Neck, N.Y., dealer in antique and foreign cars, says Mitchell Mars, a special prosecutor on Chicago's organized-crime strike force. Mr. Ringer and three brokers, once they controlled the so-called float, ran up the stock price to six cents a share from a penny, mainly by staging sham trades among themselves through nominee accounts.    &quot;The New York guys got so cocky they scammed Sarcinelli,&quot; says Mr. Mars. &quot;He was buying stock he thought wasn't controlled.&quot; After he caught on, the scam collapsed, far short of Mr. Ringer's highly lucrative goal of 25 cents a share, adds Mr. Mitchell. At least 200 Chicago and New York investors were stranded with worthless stock. Last year, Mr. Ringer and the brokers were convicted in a federal court trial in Manhattan of fraud charges. They are appealing.    In another alleged under-the-counter scam, several promoters resorted to numerous deceits to pique investor interest in Medical Dispensing Systems Inc. Northeast and to give the shell company an aura of credibility, the SEC charged in a civil suit filed in federal court in Washington, D.C. Although Medical Dispensing didn't have anything to dispense, the stock promoters projected $50 million in sales within two years. They told investors, mostly in Connecticut, that the share price would hit $10. They even brazenly listed as a director, without his knowledge, former Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania.    So adept were the promoters at &quot;preconditioning&quot; the market with misinformation, according to the SEC charges, that Medical Dispensing zoomed to $3.25 a share from 25 cents -- a 1,200% rise -- in the first day of trading. Four of them made $47,000 each on the schlock stock. The ringleader dumped enough shares on investors to make $365,000 before the stock crashed. All of those charged agreed to settle the SEC suit without admitting guilt.    Such scams aren't the only pitfalls for Pink Sheet investors. The spreads between bid and asked prices are sometimes immense in thinly traded issues. Illiquidity is common: Shortages of shares develop when the price rises and shortages of buyers develop when the price starts slipping.    To initiate a manipulation, hustlers need only persuade a brokerage firm to act as the market-maker. Under an SEC rule, the market-maker must have certain financial data about the company, such as a stock-registration statement and recent financial reports. But mainly because of manpower limitations, &quot;the rule is unenforced and unenforceable,&quot; says David Burnett, the president of the National Quotation Bureau, a Jersey City unit of Chicago-based Commercial Clearing House Inc.    Sometimes, moreover, the financial data are fictitious. Marshall Zolp was accused of forging the required documents in a scam involving the creation of Laser Arms Corp. and an imaginary self-chilling beverage can. &quot;He used the certificate of incorporation from a previous scam,&quot; says SEC attorney Bruce Hiler. &quot;He just whited out names and dates and changed everything to Laser Arms.&quot; Mr. Zolp recently pleaded guilty to criminal fraud in federal court in Newark, N.J.    Concerned by such abuses, the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees the over-the-counter markets, has a plan for automated surveillance of certain Pink Sheet stock prices and volume. Meanwhile, regulators must rely mostly on investor complaints to detect schemes such as those of Dynapac, the promoter of the bingo game and the gold mine.    Dynapac was an inactive Utah corporation, bereft of assets, when Mr. Barbara took control in 1984 and began trumpeting its prospects to wealthy investors and venture capitalists from Florida to California. &quot;He kept saying to us that Melvin Belli was his good buddy, that Melvin Belli was a 5% shareholder,&quot; says one New Mexico investor. &quot;It gave him some credibility.&quot;    The energetic Mr. Barbara, who made his mark on San Francisco-area television as a somewhat obnoxious TV-ad pitchman for a chain of furniture stores he owned, was quick with press releases, churning out more than 50 on Dynapac.    He ballyhooed Intercon Network Bingo, the television game, as a package ready for airing, when it was nothing more than a &quot;vague concept,&quot; according to the SEC suit, filed in federal court in San Jose, Calif. That didn't deter claims that 166 million bingo maniacs would play network bingo every day, generating multibillion-dollar TV revenues.    Without any basis, the SEC suit adds, Dynapac projected &quot;astronomic&quot; revenues -- $90 million a year -- from its Golden Gulch Mine near Truth or Consequences, N.M. It held open houses for prospective investors at the mine, where large amounts of rock were dug and ground up, filtered and washed, then melted in a furnace and &quot;poured into what were represented to be precious-metal blocks, shaped like pyramids,&quot; according to the criminal indictment filed against Mr. Barbara and four others in state court in Las Cruces, N.M. The trouble was, state and federal lawmen say, Dynapac didn't have a new process for separating &quot;invisible&quot; specks of gold from dirt, as claimed.    Nevertheless, investors were fed reams of misinformation, according to the SEC suit, while three Denver brokers acted as the main Dynapac market-makers in return for customer referrals from Mr. Barbara and his associates. Although the stock last traded at five cents a share, they began quoting prices at $1 in July 1984, the SEC suit says. As the price rose, Mr. Barbara and a Denver syndicate dumped unregistered stock on the market, the SEC says. Together, they reaped more than $2 million.    Dynapac hit $4 a share in the Pink Sheets by mid-December, then collapsed. Unfazed, Mr. Barbara arranged to have the stock quoted on the NASD's automated quotation system, or Nasdaq, setting the stage for an even higher price run-up with the help of Elliott Pearson, who touted Dynapac in the Silver Baron, a Reno-based investment newsletter, and on TV talk shows, the SEC says in its suit.    The stock soared to $8 a share from 62 cents, a 1,190% jump in just two months. Dynapac's market value topped $200 million, and Mr. Barbara, having acquired the company in exchange for a $75,000 promissory note he never honored, was worth more than $80 million -- on paper, that is. It was at this point that the SEC stepped in.    In October, without admitting or denying any wrongdoing, Mr. Barbara settled the SEC's civil charges of fraud and manipulation by consenting to an injunction against any future violations and promising to disgorge all his profits. Neither Mr. Pearson nor the three market-makers have settled yet with the SEC, while a few members of the Denver syndicate have.    &quot;I swear to God, this was not a stock scam,&quot; says Mr. Barbara, who still faces a $50 million damages suit, filed by irate investors in Albuquerque federal court, and who is expected to stand trial on state charges of racketeering and securities fraud in April.    &quot;Fellow, I'm clean; I'm immaculate,&quot; he says. &quot;I never stole a dime.&quot; He claims instead to have been done in by &quot;bad advice&quot; from his attorneys and by his geologist's failure to develop &quot;the magical machine&quot; for separating gold. If the geologist had, Mr. Barbara insists, &quot;Dynapac would have gone right to the moon.&quot;    (See: &quot;Corrections andamp; Amplifications: Medical Dispensing Systems Inc.&quot; -- WSJ Feb. 4, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
