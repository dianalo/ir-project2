Buying interest dried up late in the afternoon, sending the market into a retreat. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which on Tuesday had slid from a 32-point advance to an eight-point decline, lost another 14.09 to close at 1985.41.    Among broader market averages, Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index declined 1.79 to 256.13 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index eased 1.04 to 145.13. Some 1,039 issues declined on the Big Board and only 483 advanced. The American Stock Exchange Index lost nearly 2 1/4 points and the Nasdaq OTC Composite Index fell more than 2 1/2 points.    Trading activity continued to poke along at the sluggish pace set earlier this week. Big Board volume of 147.6 million shares was well below Tuesday's total of 161.9 million.    While traders said they couldn't cite any specific reason for the market's latest bout of weakness, they suggested that an overall lack of enthusiasm about the prospects for stocks and the economy was the primary factor.    &quot;Once again there's no conviction, no real feeling one way or another,&quot; said Dale Tills, manager of institutional equities trading at Charles Schwab andamp; Co., San Francisco. &quot;It just looks real negative here.&quot;    The government's report of a 0.5% jump in March consumer prices did little to change that view, traders said, even though there had been market rumors that the increase would be as much as 0.9%. The advance was the largest since January 1987, and some economists pointed to the report as a sign that inflation could accelerate to the 5%-to-6% level this year from the 4% level that has prevailed recently.    The consumer price report came on the heels of two pieces of economic news that disappointed investors last week: the widening of the trade deficit to $13.83 billion in February and the 0.6% increase in producer prices last month.    After the plunge in stock prices last week following the trade report and the heightening of inflation fears, analysts indicated that the latest report did little to calm anyone's nerves.    Edward G. Webb Jr., a senior vice president at Bull andamp; Bear Group Inc., a New York-based money management firm, said the market is in &quot;one of these very choppy periods where people need to be reassured, and the numbers aren't there to reassure them.&quot;    Although Mr. Webb said he expects the data to eventually be seen as a one-month aberration, he acknowledged that the market's skittishness and short-term orientation have colored investors' view of the reports. &quot;They're disturbing a lot of people,&quot; he said.    In particular, market participants have become concerned about the prospect that the Federal Reserve will act to control inflation by tightening its credit policy, which would extend the recent upturn in interest rates and possibly trigger a slowdown in the economy.    While Mr. Webb said he doesn't expect that chain of events to occur, he added that the Fed clearly isn't in a position to help the bond market break out of its slump, which would give stocks a boost.    Robert S. Robbins, a technical analyst and market strategist at Robinson-Humphrey Co., Atlanta, said the current weakness presents a buying opportunity. &quot;There's no question that there's more downside risk than there was before, but there's also much more upside potential,&quot; he said. In particular, he contends that a stable dollar could rekindle foreign interest in buying U.S. stocks, especially among the Japanese, whose market recently reached all-time highs.    Bethlehem Steel advanced 1/2 to 19 7/8. Prudential-Bache Securities issued a recommendation to buy the stock at its current price level, according to the Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.    Oil stocks weakened as crude oil futures extended their recent pullback in New York trading. Chevron slipped 5/8 to 45 7/8; Texaco eased 1/4 to 46 5/8; Amoco dropped 5/8 to 76 3/4, and Mobil lost 1 1/8 to 44 7/8.    Airline stocks were mixed. Delta Air Lines added 3/4 to 49 5/8; AMR remained unchanged at 42 1/8; Allegis lost 7/8 to 79 1/4 and NWA dropped 5/8 to 39 1/4.    American Brands added 3/8 to 43 1/2. The company agreed to sell its Andrew Jergens unit to Kao Corp. of Japan and completed the sale of its Sunshine Biscuits unit to G.F. Industries. The sales are expected to result in a gain of about $70 million in the second quarter. The company also reported that its first-quarter net from continuing operations rose to $1.45 a share from $1.19 a year ago.    Irving Bank advanced 1/4 to 61. Banca Commerciale Italiana boosted its tender offer to $75 a share from $65, but lowered the number of shares to be acquired to 8.5 million from 9.5 million. Separately, Irving said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York objected to its plan to boost its quarterly dividend to $1.125 a share from 60.5 cents.    Irving's actions are part of its efforts to fend off a hostile takeover bid from Bank of New York, which was unchanged at 31 3/8.    Columbia Gas System, which reduced its quarterly dividend to 50 cents a share from 79.5 cents, fell 1 to 28 7/8. The company attributed the dividend cut to its inability to recover certain costs incurred by its Columbia Gas Transmission unit.    The American Stock Exchange Index, which is heavily weighted toward oil issues, dropped 2.20 to 297.72 as oil prices declined.    Imperial Oil Class A lost 1 1/2 to 48 1/2. Its first-quarter net income dropped to 80 cents (Canadian) a share from 96 cents a year earlier, and the company said it expects continued softness in the second quarter.    In the over-the-counter market, declining issues outnumbered advancers by 1,343 to 742.    Centerre Bancorp plunged 5 3/4 to 35 1/2 after agreeing to be acquired by Mercantile Bancorp in a stock swap. Each of Centerre's 7.8 million shares will be exchanged for 1.6 shares of a new holding company, while Mercantile's 16 million shares will be swapped on a one-for-one basis. Mercantile finished unchanged at 22 1/4.    Amgen fell 7/8 to 27 5/8. Analysts said that the decline reflected concerns over the awarding of a broad U.S. patent to Ajinomoto for techniques used to produce Interleukin-2. The patent is believed to cover forms of the cancer drug produced by Amgen and Cetus, which eased 1/8 to 12 5/8.    Properties of America added 1/2 to 5 5/8 in extremely heavy trading, with nearly one-fourth of its total shares outstanding changing hands. The company and market makers in the stock said they couldn't account for the activity.    Regis Corp. added 1/4 to 16 5/8. The company accepted a sweetened offer of $17.50 a share from Curtis Squire Inc., a firm controlled by Regis Chairman Myron Kunin that already owns about 70% of the company's common shares.    Big O Tires climbed 1/2 to 3 1/2 bid in heavy trading. The company disclosed that it has held preliminary discussions with potential merger partners and has retained Boettcher andamp; Co., an investment banking firm, to provide assistance in connection with the talks. </TEXT></DOC>
