<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-82-0795 </DOCNO><TEXT>Experience and results obtained with automatic steering systems for shearerloaders in the UK South Yorkshire Area are described. The benefits include:less dirt cut; more coal recovered from the roof; a smooth roof for poweredsupports; no large deviations for the armored conveyor pans; forwardwalk way lighting systems on the powered supports, giving greatly improvedvisibility; on-line real-time information for mine managers; conditionmonitoring and maintenance of face equipment; less chance of human errorin cut heights and in steering the shearer; possibility of selectiveextraction; reduction of the ignition risk; reduced maintenance sinceless rock is cut; and reduced dust make. Innovations include: the pickforce guidance system, which will respond to changes in rock and coalhardness; and an increased a number of subsystems at the face such asautomatic vertical guidance, face-end automation; face alignment andadvance control; chock initiation; AFC load control; condition monitoring;and environmental monitoring. Such subsystems may be interconnected usingthe Multipurpose Automatic Control Equipment System (MACE). 6 refs.,1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
