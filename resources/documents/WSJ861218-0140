Incidents such as those in your report show more than a willful attempt to preserve a false &quot;safety record&quot; to keep insurance rates low and to preserve a false record with OSHA. They also show a deliberate attempt to deprive injured workers of their Worker's Compensation and other rights.    I was confronted with a similar situation a number of years ago. A client of mine was injured at work when a brick fell off a scaffolding and hit him on the head. He rejected his boss's offer to &quot;give&quot; him money to cover his medical expenses and lost time (it was actually to be a loan to be repaid from future paychecks). When we filed a Worker's Compensation claim, he was fired.    After we settled the Worker's Compensation claim (for a fairly substantial amount, as he was seriously injured), we requested that the employer furnish the employee with a &quot;service letter&quot; under Missouri labor laws truly stating the reason he was discharged. When a false letter was given, I filed a suit for $1 actual damages (fortunately, the employee was able to procure other employment without the need for the letter) and for punitive damages. We received a substantial settlement when I began assembling evidence of the widespread practice by the employer of coercing and intimidating injured employees into not filing Worker's Compensation claims.    A few aggressive lawsuits by injured employees and their families would probably do a lot more to keep employers on the straight and narrow than 20 OSHA investigations will ever do.    Darwin Portman   Attorney at Law   St. Louis   ---   I am distressed, not by your subject, but by the way you dealt with it. A reader could be led to believe, through the sensational treatment of a relatively minor problem, that any progress in mine safety has been due to clever bookkeeping.    My company, too, has competed for the Sentinels of Safety Award. We know that it is not awarded without a thorough audit of the winning mine and its workforce, so I am perplexed by your version.    As an industry representative, I don't object to legitimate and even harsh criticism when it helps improve the safety effort. But I do expect, especially from the Journal, sober analysis, not superficial and narrowly focused journalism.    There may well be deficiencies in the government's accident-reporting system. These can be corrected. But even the most rudimentary analysis shows the dramatic progress in coal safety over the last decade. In 1975 there were 155 coal-mine fatalities; a decade later there were 67. During that time coal production increased more than one-third.    Any responsible story must start from this record and then go forward on what remains to be done.    Allen S.
