Below the surface, frenzied officials faced last-minute crises.   Organizers of the giant Friday night parade hired sharpshooterswith tranquilizer guns in case the elephants decided to moonwalkdown the Champs-Elysees with the Florida Aandamp;M Marching Band.   It was not immediately clear how fast a tranquilizer dart worked.Or what one did with an inert elephant in the middle of a parade.   Authorities had planned a temporary ban of alcohol along theChamps Elysees, fearing rowdiness from crowds milling around withliquid components of their moveable feast.   Faced with violent objection, however, they backed down. Onecolumnist observed: ``Do they think anyone would have stormed theBastille without wine?''</TEXT><TEXT>   Most Frenchmen left in town seemed to be wearing uniforms andsidearms, herding polyglot legions behind endless metal barriersthat lent an ominous tone to bright blue, white and red bunting.   There was plenty to see, and eat, while waiting for the world'sbiggest party to materialize as promised. But getting there wasdecidedly not half the fun.   Following signs to Tuileries 89, featuring a computer-art replicaof a 1789 Paris street and an android variety show, two visitorswere stopped by guards.   ``You can't go in there,'' said one, ``It's closed for July 14celebrations.''   But, the visitors said, that was why everyone was in Paris.   ``Look,'' the guard said, ``We got missiles, anti-missilemissiles, fireworks. How do you expect us to let the public inhere?''   The visitors eventually found the right way in.</TEXT><TEXT>   In the gardens outside, an aging, elegant lady followed herpoodle in aimless circles. Each had a bewildered expression. ``Canyou help me out of here?'' she asked a stranger, seeking guidance ina neighborhood she had inhabited for 40 years.   ``This is insanity, a disgrace,'' she said, identifying herselfonly as Odette. ``You can't go anywhere. I have friends who got apass that allows them to leave their house, but they have no pass tocome home at night.''   She referred to draconian parking and driving regulations thathave sealed the center of Paris. Later, a taxi driver named Rolandwas asked if he would be working the long weekend.   ``Are you crazy?'' he replied, smacking his left forearm in aFrench gesture depicting a rapid escape. ``I'm getting out of here.''</TEXT><TEXT>   For a privileged few, Paris has never been easier.   The trick is a series of passes, invitations and credentials, theissuing of which would have thrown King Louis XVI's protocol staffinto cold sweat.   Cars move swiftly down freshly swept boulevards, ablaze in thecolor of hyacinths and roses and giant tricolors tied in bows,unless any of 33 visiting presidents or prime ministers happens by.   Near the Grand Palais, police waved on two tourists who ambledpeaceably across the broad road. Suddenly, an officer yelled:``Move!''   The tourists leaped sideways just as roaring motorcycles and astretch Peugeot flying a Cameroon flag careered around the corner atbreakneck speed, missing them by inches.   On the Rue du Faubourg St. Honore, the elegant street on whichthe Elysee Palace is situated, police shoved Parisians back intotheir shops when several visitors' motorcades flashed past.   ``I thought this was our city,'' one muttered.   If conspicuous, the security was not necessarily effective. Onejournalist, testing it out, walked through a sealed-off area with ahunting rifle in a scabbard.</TEXT><TEXT>   All over town, people caught up on their rest wherever theycould. At the Tuileries, a disheveled couple lay sprawled under astatue, an upended champagne bottle by their bare feet.   They were in stark contrast to the dapper stone figure toweringover them, Jules Ferry, the 19th century premier who set France on a``civilizing mission'' to bring couth to a savage world.   Souvenir shops did a brisk trade in revolutionary lingerie, funnyhats and condoms imprinted with a guillotine.   Overall, officials said, the festivities were expected to attract$160 million to Paris, but merchants weren't convinced.   ``This is a T-shirt crowd,'' sniffed Patrice, a salesman in adowntown gallery where Italian jackets start at $600. ``These arenot spenders, believe me.''</TEXT><TEXT>   The newspapers held fascinating tidbits. One noted that securityteams for visiting leaders had to negotiate the firearms they wereallowed, based on a strict quid pro quo.   The Japanese were not permitted any. When President FrancoisMitterrand attended Emperor Hirohito's funeral, his security guardwas stripped of weapons, as were all others.   The International Herald Tribune reprinted an item from 100 yearsago: ``The present week is being filled up to overflowing withofficial and social events.'' There was a state dinner for officersof the Paris garrison and a commemorative fete for CamilleDesmoulins ``of Revolutionary fame'' during which participants wouldwear horse chestnut leaves and tricolor cockades.   July 14th ``will be celebrated in a way that it is hoped willsurpass all past events of a similar kind that this gay capital hasever witnessed,'' it concluded.   This year's organizers said the same thing, and they may beright. But 1879 festivities included a world's fair that left Pariswith the Eiffel Tower, a tough act to follow.</TEXT></DOC>
