The calls came in a leaflet that also designated today a day offirebomb attacks to protest Israel's deportation of 33 Arabs sincethe revolt against 21 years of Israeli occupation began in the WestBank and Gaza Strip.   The leaflet was distributed a day after Israeli troops shot andwounded 17 Palestinians in bloody clashes throughout Gaza. Ninetyother Arabs were injured by beatings or overcome by tear gas,Western relief officials said.   ``There is no going back on the achievements realized on thepath to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state onour national soil ... The Zionists (will) be driven out of our landso we may built on it our independent state with its capital inJerusalem,'' the four-page statement said.   There is ``no sign of weariness on the part of the masses,'' theleaflet added. ``We invite you to extend the struggle against theoccupation.''   The leaflet, the 24th issued since the uprising began Dec. 8,called for setting up underground classrooms, planting crops forstorage and boycotting Israeli farm products.   It also called on Palestinians to stage four days of generalstrikes over the next seven days in solidarity with deportees andwith five Palestinians killed in a fire in Tel Aviv and by Israelitroops in a prison riot last week.   Palestinians also were urged to defy Israel's ban on autonomousgrassroots committees, calling for ``redoubled efforts'' to buildmore of them.   It also applauded neighboring Jordan's severing earlier thismonth of legal and adminstrative ties with the West Bank as ``oneof the main achievements of the uprising.''   An army spokesman said, meanwhile, that soldiers maintainedcurfews today on four refugee camps and neighborhoods where theviolence occurred in the Gaza Strip, confining about 118,000Palestinians to their homes.   The West Bank's largest city of Nablus and three neighboringrefugee camps, whose combined populations are about 140,000, alsowere under curfew for a second straight day.   The clashes followed a general strike, which was called toprotest the Israeli policy of confiscating propety of Arabsrefusing to pay taxes.   The fighting became intense when the Israeli army imposedcurfews in the Jabaliya, Shati and Bureij refugee camps and partsof Gaza City.   Palestinians using loudspeakers at Moslem mosques called onresidents of the camps to defy the orders, and hundreds responded,blocking roads, burning tires and stoning Israeli patrols.   No deaths were reported in Monday's violence. At least 252 Arabsand four Israelis have been killed in the clashes since theuprising began in the lands Israel seized in the 1967 Middle Eastwar.   In another development, Michel Sabah, the first Arab to beappointed Roman Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem, rejected aninvitation to meet Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin at the Parliamentin Jerusalem, a church official said Monday.   He told The Associated Press the refusal was in line with thechurch's policy not to meet with Israeli authorities in Jerusalem.   The Vatican does not recognize Israeli control over Jerusalem,which was given international status under a 1947 partition plan bythe United Nations. Israel captured the Arab section of Jerusalemin the 1967 war and later declared all of the city as the Israelicapital.</TEXT></DOC>
