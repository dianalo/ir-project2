<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-78-0382 </DOCNO><TEXT>During the second National Ozone Expedition ground-based observationsat McMurdo Station Antarctica were performed which resulted in a secondseason's measurement of abnormally large amounts of ClO in the Antarcticspring stratosphere. The original measurements of 1986, in which thepresence of this anomalous layer was first discovered, were limited inlow altitude recovery of the ClO mixing ratio profile by the restrictionsof the spectral bandwidth (256 MHz) which was used to measure the pressure-broadenedClO emission line shape. The 1987 measurements were marked by the useof twice the spectral bandpass employed the previous year, and allowa better characterization of the ClO mixing ratio profile in the criticalaltitude range 18 to 25 km. In-situ aircraft measurements of ClO madeover the Palmer Peninsula during Aug. and Sept. of 1987 by Anderson,et al. effectively determined the important question of the ClO mixingratio profile at altitudes inaccessible to our technique, below approximately18 to 18.5 km. These flights did not penetrate further than 75 deg S,however, (vs 78 deg S for McMurdo) and were thus limited to coveragenear the outer boundaries of the region of severest ozone depletion overAntarctica in 1987, did not reach an altitude convincingly above thatof the peak mixing ratio for ClO, and were not able to make significantobservations of the diurnal variation of ClO. The two techniques, andthe body of data recovered by each, thus complement one another in producinga full picture of the anomalous ClO layer intimately connected with theregion of Antarctic spring ozone depletion. An analysis is presentedof the mixing ratio profile from approximately 18 to 45 km, the diurnalbehavior, and the secular change in ClO over McMurdo Station during Sept.and early Oct. 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
