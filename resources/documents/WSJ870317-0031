Interleukin-2 is thought to hold potential in treating certain forms of cancer.    An official of the biotechnology concern said the European Patent Office can grant protection in 11 countries, though patents also may be applied for directly in individual countries. Cetus already has received patent protection for the engineered protein, called Proleukin, in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, Belgium and Spain, as well as in the U.S.    After the European office accepts an application, Cetus said, opposition to the patent can be raised during a nine-month period.    Robert A. Fildes, president and chief executive officer, said six trials using the protein are under way in Europe. </TEXT></DOC>
