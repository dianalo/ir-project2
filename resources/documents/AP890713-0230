MARTINEZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Auto pollution, oil spills and growing dependence on foreignersfor fuel have helped natural gas emerge as an energy solution that'sliterally lurking beneath our feet, scientists say.   The naturally occurring gas called methane, once considereduseful mainly to heat and cook, is now widely viewed as the mostrealistic way to power cars and trucks into the 21st century becauseit is plentiful, safe and clean.   There's such a vast supply underground that U.S. energy companiescap wells when the price gets too low for profitable sale.Petroleum-rich Saudi Arabia squanders methane by burning the gas asit spurts from crude oil wells.   ``The Saudis flare each day enough gas to fuel two-thirds of theroad transport of Western Europe,'' says Princeton Universityprofessor Enoch Durbin, a leading proponent of the natural gasalternative.   ``From a satellite, the brightest subject on earth you'd thinkwould be New York or San Francisco. It's the Saudi fields.''   Natural-gas powered vehicles in Canada, part of an experimentalfuel-alternative program Durbin helped create, have logged 500,000miles without an overhaul because gaseous fuel does not cause thewear and tear of liquid fuel. Liquid fuels wash lubricants off wallsof a car's engine, increasing friction and wear.   The Canadian vehicles recently began rusting and falling apart.But the engines are in such good condition they are being sold foruse in other vehicles, Durbin says.   Despite its attractiveness, natural gas as a motor fuel has twobig drawbacks.   First, it takes up 1,000 times the space of equivalent gasolineand must therefore be compressed. Even then, it occupies more spacethan gasoline, so natural-gas powered vehicles need big tanks andfrequent fillups.   A car Durbin converted and supplied with two natural gas tankscould go only 200 miles without a refill, for example.   The second obstacle is the lack of a nationwide refuelingstructure.   ``If you're going to use it you have to be confined to a regularroute where you can refill,'' says Michael German, senior vicepresident of the American Gas Association, which represents U.S.distributors and pipelines.   German says the 30,000 cars in the United States now running onnatural gas are mainly fleet vehicles that travel regular routes.   One remedy proposed is to equip vehicles with dual-fuel tanks, soif the natural gas runs out, the driver could switch to gasoline.But the extra tanks would take up passenger and cargo space.   Where to store natural gas also is considered by some to be aproblem. Unlike petroleum, natural gas needs a large, leakproofstorage vault or it escapes into the atmosphere.   Natural gas now flows to homes and businesses through about 1.2million miles of underground metal pipe.   So the system exists for getting gas from producers to servicestations. What's needed, scientists say, are pumps at the stationsto dispense the gas into vehicles.   Ninety-three percent of the natural gas used in the United Statesis domestically produced and the rest comes from Canada. Nearly halfthe crude oil consumed here, on the other hand, is foreign.   About 80 percent of natural gas comes from underground gasreservoirs; the rest is found with oil.   Some experts worry that greatly increased use of natural gaswould deplete supplies and increase reliance on foreign energysuppliers, but others reject that fear.   ``We have such huge methane reserves we don't know how much wehave,'' says Raymond Baddour, chemical engineering professor atMassachusetts Institute of Technology. ``I think this fuel has avery bright future for you, your children and grandchildren.''   Moreover, it is renewable from unconventional sources such asputrifying garbage, sewage and animal waste, which theoreticallycould yield limitless supplies.   Durbin recalls asking a geologist about the supply of natural gas.   ``He said, `What do you want to pay? At 60 cents per 1,000 cubicfeet, there's none.'   ``No one wants to drill a deep hole if it's cheap,'' Durbin says.``If you tell me you're willing to pay $2 instead of 60 cents, Isuddenly can drill a deep hole.''   The Department of Energy estimates proven reserves of natural gasin the United States total 187.2 trillion cubic feet. By somereckonngs, that represents at least three centuries' worth ofsupply, even if all U.S. vehicles burned natural gas instead ofgasoline.   Proven reserves of domestic crude oil, in comparison, areestimated at 27.3 billion barrels, or a 9{-year supply at currentconsumption rates.   ``There is a tremendous amount of shut-in gas that is sittingthere waiting for a market or for the price to go up, which is thesame thing,'' says Charles Andrew, an official of John S. Herold andamp;Co., an oil and gas appraisal concern.   About a half million cars are powered by natural gas worldwide,all backyard creations. No auto manufacturer makes a natural gascar, but that is changing.   The Soviet Union, for example, is developing a plant to massproduce natural gas-powered vehicles by 1991.   In the United States, the allure of natural gas has presentedautomakers with a Catch-22 problem. They are reluctant to build anatural-gas car, largely because the fuel is not yet widelyavailable. Oil companies balk at producing large quantities untilthe vehicles gain acceptance.   New clean air regulations, however, could spur them into action.   The Environmental Protection Agency has set air quality standardsfor new buses in 1991 that no diesel engine can now meet. Similarrules for trucks take effect in 1994.   While diesel engine manufacturers are designing prototypes thatwould burn substitute fuels, natural gas is at the top of the list.   ``They've kept their options open but natural gas has veryclean-burning fuel with no particulate matter, which is the biggestproblem diesel users have,'' German says. ``So it makes sense tofocus on natural gas over the others.''   Several U.S. cities are now experimenting with natural gas topower municipal vehicles, largely because fleet operators realizethey could save money, German says.   A gallon equivalent of natural gas costs about 40 cents vs. about$1.15 for regular unleaded. A taxi company in Canada that spent$900,000 to convert 128 vehicles, for example, recovered the expensein a year via savings of $75,000 a month in fuel costs.   Another big advantage of natural gas is that it emits mainlywater and carbon dioxide when burned.   ``You use natural gas at home without ventilating. You're cookingwith it. You wouldn't think of using kerosene, gasoline or anythingelse without ventilation,'' says Durbin.   Moreover, Durbin and others say, natural gas doesn't ignite aseasily as gasoline, so in a car crash it would dissipate harmlesslyinstead of exploding in a dangerous fireball.   Other gasoline alternatives proposed by the Bush Administration,including ethanol and methanol, are costlier, dirtier and wouldincrease oil consumption because it takes more crude to make them,says MIT professor David White, co-director of the school's energylaboratory.   ``Some people who are proposing these changes haven't done theirhomework,'' White says.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday July 16</NOTE></DOC>
