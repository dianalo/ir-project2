The allowance may be as much as 20 percentof an employee's rate of basic pay. The retention allowance is not consideredpart of an employee's rate of basic pay for any purpose. However, the retentionallowance is considered to be part of ``total remuneration'' for the purposeof computing overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).The demonstration project covers approximately 2,000 employees at participatingfacilities who occupy safety-related positions, such as air traffic controllers,aviation safety inspectors, and airway facilities maintenance technicians.The demonstration will run for 5 years from the date of implementation.The tentatively approved project plan was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 2, 1988, Volume 53, Number 212. Apublic hearing was held by OPM at FAA Great Lakes Region Headquarters inDes Plaines, Illinois, on December 14, 1988, during which interested personsor organizations presented their written or oral views on the proposedproject. All persons who requested to testify or present written statementswere permitted to do so. The hearing record was left open after the conclusionof the hearing to receive additional written data, views and argumentsfrom hearing participants. The record was closed on January 3, 1989. Inaddition to the public hearing, interested parties were given from thedate of publication until January 3, 1989, to express their views on theproject. Comments received after January 3, 1989, were also considered.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments</ITAG>Letters or testimony were received from the following sources:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s10,19</C> <H1>Source</H1><H1>Number</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Members of Congress <D>35</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Labor Unions <D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Other organizations <D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">FAA workforce <D/>(933 signers) 125<R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total </ITAG><D>163</D></ITAG>All but six comments expressed approval of the project. However, the overwhelmingmajority urged that the project be expanded to include additional facilitiesand occupations.Addition of Other Air Traffic, Airway Facilities, and Aviation StandardsFacilitiesMost commentors said that additional facilities, perceived as ``hard tostaff'', should be covered. Specifically, they recommended expanding theproject to include additional FAA facilities in the following locations:<ITAG tagnum="15">Atlanta, Georgia.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Boston, Massachusetts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Detroit, Michigan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Hawthorne, California.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Indianapolis, Indiana.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Lancaster, California.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Los Angeles, California metropolitan area.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Minneapolis, Minnesota.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">New York City metropolitan area.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Oakland, California.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Ontario, California.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Palmdale, California.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">San Francisco, California.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Santa Barbara, California.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">South Bend, Indiana.</ITAG>Based upon the many comments received, a further review of the selectionprocess and the covered facilities and occupations was conducted by theDepartment of Transportation (DOT) and FAA. This review showed, as didthe initial review, that there were other facilities which experience staffingdifficulties. One of these facilities, the Bay TRACON (Terminal Radar ApproachControl) in Oakland, California, was determined by FAA to have the mostsevere and chronic staffing difficulties of the hard-to-staff facilitieswhich were suggested by respondents. After carefully considering all ofthe comments and other factors involved, and using the same principlesand criteria as in the initial selection process, DOT and FAA recommendedand OPM agreed to expand the project to include the Bay TRACON.The staffing situation at Bay TRACON is extremely critical because of thepending implementation of the San Jose Airport Radar Service Area (ARSA),which has been delayed due to the critical staffing situation at Bay TRACON.The TRACON has an authorization of 75 controllers, but currently has only40 full-performance-level controllers and 15 developmental controllers.Recruitment efforts for the Bay TRACON have been extensive, including continuously-openvacancy announcements, mailings and visits to other facilities, and othercomprehensive outreach programs to attract experienced controllers. Ideally,candidates for complex TRACON facilities such as Bay TRACON would haveprevious radar experience, but because of these recruiting difficulties,many selectees are from non-radar facilities or the FAA Academy. The facilitiesinitially included in the project are located in the New York, Chicago,and Los Angeles areas. Addition of a facility in the Oakland area expandsthe geographic coverage of the project, and includes another facility withmajor impact on the national aviation system.The decision was also made that expansion to other hard-to-staff facilities,other than the Bay TRACON, was not appropriate. Although some of the facilitiesproposed for inclusion by respondents also experience staffing difficulties,none were found to have problems to the same extent as the covered facilities.Non-covered facilities are distinguished from covered facilities by oneor more of the following factors:andbullet; The staffing situation is not as chronic or as severe as at thosefacilities which have been included in the project. Some of the facilitiesrespondents recommended for inclusion are currently at or above authorizedstaffing levels.andbullet; The facility is generally less complex than the Level V air trafficfacilities included in the project, is therefore able to recruit well-qualifiedemployees from a larger number of same-level or lower-level facilities,and can more easily accommodate developmental controllers, from the FAAacademy or other facilities, who do not have extensive radar experienceand are not in such short supply. Many of these facilities serve as themain sources of candidates for more complex Level V facilities.andbullet; The facility does not have the same high level of impact on thenational aviation system as the covered facilities.Cost of LivingMany of the respondents recommended that certain facilities be includedbecause of the high cost-of-living in the localities in which the facilitieswere located. However, the demonstration project is not providing a cost-of-livingallowance. It is strictly designed to test whether pay incentives willimprove the FAA's ability to recruit and retain fully qualified employeesat hard-to-staff facilities.Addition of Other Occupations<ITAG tagnum="81">Supervisory and Managerial Positions</ITAG>Two of the three labor unions representing employees covered by the paydemonstration project questioned the inclusion of supervisory and managerialpersonnel at the covered facilities. The National Air Traffic ControllersAssociation (NATCA) stated that it has yet to see any FAA facilities thatcannot be adequately staffed with supervisors and managers. The ProfessionalAirway Systems Specialists (PASS) stated that there is no shortage of supervisorsand managers; however, PASS supports the inclusion of supervisors who aredirectly and daily engaged in safety-related functions. The third union,the American Federation of Government Employees, did not state a positionregarding supervisors and managers.Inclusion of facility supervisors and managers of subordinate employeescovered by this project, as proposed by the DOT/FAA, is proper and warrantedby the operational nature of the national aviation system, and reflectssound management principles. These positions are an integral part of theaviation system and provide career progression opportunities to employees.In addition, some facilities experience problems recruiting for supervisoryand managerial positions, and have difficulty attracting experienced personnelto apply for these positions. The vital nature of these positions was recognizedby Congress when it enacted the Air Traffic Control Revitalization Actof 1982, and there has been no change in circumstances that would warrantexclusion of these positions from the project. In addition, failure toinclude supervisory and managerial positions would result in the pay ofthese jobs falling below that of some of the supervised employees.<ITAG tagnum="81">Entry-Level Airway Facilities Positions</ITAG>The initial determination made prior to issuance of the proposed regulationswas that airway facilities positions below the GS-9 level would be excludedfrom the demonstration project. The primary reason for this determinationwas concern over creating unfair competition with other agencies who recruitemployees in the same occupations. The occupations involved include entry-levelengineers, electronics technicians, and computer operators. Approximately14 employees in these positions are now employed at the covered facilities.Based on input received from the public hearing and during the commentperiod, this issue was reexamined.Upon reconsideration, it is apparent that these positions are indeed uniqueto the FAA. The duties and responsibilities of these positions are significantlydifferent than positions in the same occupations in other agencies, andthe specific knowledge, experience, and other qualifications would nottypically be comparable. The electronic technicians, engineers, and computeroperators of FAA are system-oriented. Knowledge of the National AirspaceSystem (NAS) is essential to properly perform these technical positions.Although the types of equipment with which these employees work may besimilar to the equipment of other agencies, the ability to work with thisequipment within the NAS system environment is an integral component ofthese positions.Therefore, employees occupying airway facilities positions at the GS-5through GS-8 level at covered facilities will be included in the demonstrationproject.<ITAG tagnum="81">Other Occupations</ITAG>Some respondents recommended that other occupations be covered, includingair traffic assistants and administrative and support personnel. Theseoccupations are not being included in the project. The project is designedto test whether pay incentives will improve recruitment and retention ofemployees in those safety-related occupations where the FAA experiencesthe most critical staffing problems. It is not intended to cover otheroccupations (some of which we have covered in special pay rate authorizations)where the FAA may not have similar difficulties in recruiting and retainingemployees and which are common to other Federal agencies. To do so wouldgive the FAA an unfair competitive advantage over other local agenciesdrawing from the same labor pool.<ITAG tagnum="21">U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>The Demonstration project plan as approved by the Office of Personnel Managementreads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="84">Department of Transportation/Federal Aviation Administration DemonstrationProject</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Table of Contents</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">I.

On-site briefings for employees have been done at each of theparticipating facilities and included detailed orientation on the backgroundand purpose of the project, implementation and administrative procedures,and anticipated results. Appropriate human resource management and accounting/payrollorganizations will receive detailed orientation and training prior to implementation.<ITAG tagnum="81">Evaluation Plan</ITAG>A methodically rigorous evaluation plan has been designed to assess projectoutcomes and to evaluate their system-wide impacts on the organization'smission and their applicability to other Federal organizations. The designis ``quasi-experimental'' and includes pre- and post-demonstration comparisons.The evaluation model postulates significant increases in the desired outcomemeasures in facilities covered by the demonstration project. Attempts willbe made to establish cause-and-effect relationships. In order to assurea thorough assessment of the demonstration, the evaulation will cover threedistinct phases: (1) An evaluation of the implementation phase to determinethat the project is implemented as designed and that the stated processesare operational; (2) periodic assessments of the 5-year experimental phase;and (3) a summative evaluation of the project's overall impact on the organization.The plan provides for collection of historical data for three years (FiscalYears 1986, 1987, and 1988) preceding the start of the demonstration project.This baseline data will cover measures relating to staffing levels, turnoverrates, employees' experience levels, overtime and sick leave use, morale,and productivity.<ITAG tagnum="81">Costs</ITAG>The estimated costs for the demonstration project for the first year areapproximately $20.1 million for the identified facilities, based on currentpay rates.

Introduction</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">A. Purpose</ITAG>The purpose of the demonstration project is to determine whether pay incentiveswill enhance the ability of the FAA to recruit and retain experienced,qualified employees in designated occupations at certain hard-to-stafflocations. Staffing levels are expected to improve at these locations.To accomplish this purpose, this demonstration project provides for paymentof a retention allowance to employees occupying safety-related positionsat selected hard-to-staff facilities. The allowance may be as much as 20percent of an employee's base pay. The retention allowance is not partof an employee's rate of basic pay. However, the retention allowance isconsidered to be part of ``total remuneration'' for the purpose of computingovertime pay entitlements under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Problems With the Present System</ITAG>Adequate staffing of FAA facilities with experienced personnel is vitalto ensure a continuing high level of public safety. As part of its safetyresponsibilities, FAA is currently engaged in a full-scale effort to supportand improve its safety-related work force. Comprehensive changes are beingmade to the recruitment, pre-employment processing, and the technical trainingprograms and processes. A study of the existing pay system for air trafficcontrollers has identified numerous problems with the inflexibility ofcurrent methods for classifying and compensating these employees.Staffing of certain facilities is a problem that has plagued DOT and FAAfor many years. Problems associated with staffing include difficulty inattracting adequate numbers of employees, high turnover rates, a low percentageof employees at the full performance level, and high overtime usage. Theseproblems also contribute to difficulty in granting employees' requeststo move to other facilities, difficulty in approving annual leave requests,and low morale.The agency has tried many approaches at hard-to-staff facilities, withinthe limitations of existing laws and regulations, in an effort to solvethese problems, with only limited success. For example, FAA has given additionalcredit for promotion consideration to employees who have experience ata variety of facilities; developed a ``farm team'' system of progressionwhere surrounding facilities feed personnel into larger facilities; reorganizedfacilities and job junctions; developed revised classification standardsand re-evaluated positions; conducted nationwide recruiting campaigns;developed a cross-option recruitment program for air traffic control specialists;guaranteed employees who are not successful at the most complex facilitiesthe opportunity to return to their former facility; and guaranteed employeesa choice of duty assignment after a specified length of service and attainmentof full performance level. Yet, in spite of these efforts, staffing difficultiescontinue to plague certain facilities.The covered facilities are characterized by some combination of the followingconditions:andbullet; Recruitment difficulties. Some facilities have a chronic problemin attracting adequate numbers of fully-qualified employees to fill vacantpositions.andbullet; High turnover rates. Some facilities have chronic problems retainingemployees and consequently have high turnover rates.andbullet; Low experience levels. Some facilities have a large percentageof employees who are not fully qualified or who otherwise do not have extensiveexperience.andbullet; High overtime use. Some facilities have a high level of overtimeuse, with employees in some cases working an average of four hours of overtimeper week.FAA's staffing problems have captured the attention of numerous publicand private sector organizations and individuals, including members ofCongress, the General Accounting Office (GAO), the news media, and theAviation Safety Commission.In its report dated October 8, 1987, the Senate Appropriations Committeedirected the administration to develop proposals to eliminate the constraintsfound under current personnel law and regulations that prohibit FAA fromproviding incentives to compensate for cost-of-living or similar factorsin order to provide the needed staff at certain hard-to-staff facilities.Additionally, H.R. 4650 and S. 1600, bills introduced during the 1988 congressionalsession, provided for the FAA to develop compensation systems tailoredto ``* * * facilitate the use of flexibilities in assigning rates of basicpay in order to better recruit, motivate and retain a well-qualified workforce'' (S. 1600); and to ``* * * establish a pay rate and grade system* * * designed to * * * recruit and retain a well-qualified workforce ** *.'' (H.R. 4650).<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Personnel System Change</ITAG>Many researchers have shown that pay is one of the most important and influentialincentives an employer can offer in an attempt to alter employee behavior.Offering a pay allowance at hard-to-staff facilities could influence potentialemployees to accept or overlook the negative factors associated with aparticular facility or geographic area. It is expected that more employeeswill be motivated to apply for positions at the participating facilities,and to remain in those facilities for longer periods of time. The demonstrationproject will test whether a retention allowance of up to 20 percent ofbase pay will help to attract and retain experienced employees at the hard-to-stafffacilities selected for the project.The demonstration project provides for payment of a retention allowanceto employees occupying safety-related positions at the covered hard-to-stafffacilities. The retention allowances will be paid quarterly on the lastpayday of each calendar quarter. Except as explained below, the quarterlyretention allowance will be computed as a specified percentage (not toexceed 20 percent on an annual basis) of the employee's rate of basic payin effect for each pay period during the quarterly allowance period.In the case of an employee who is initially employed in or reassigned toa covered position after the beginning of the quarterly allowance period,the amount will be prorated on the basis of the number of full weeks ofemployment in a covered position during the period. In the case of a part-timeemployee, the quarterly retention allowance will be prorated on the basisof the employee's scheduled tour of duty during each pay period of thequarterly allowance period. Employees who voluntarily leave covered positions during a quarterly allowanceperiod will not receive an allowance for that period. Employees who aresuspended during a quarterly allowance period will not receive an allowancefor that period. Employees who are in a leave-without-pay status or whoare absent-without-leave will be eligible for a prorated allowance whichwill be reduced by the number of hours in a non-pay status. All coveredemployees will be told at the time the project is implemented (or uponinitial employment in or reassignment to a covered position) what the percentageof the allowance will be, and eligible employees will receive the fullallowance proffered them. Employees will also be notified in advance ofchanges in the percentage of the allowance. The retention allowance is not considered part of the employee's rate ofbasic pay for any purpose. However, the retention allowance is consideredto be part of ``total remuneration'' for the purpose of computing overtimepay entitlements under FLSA. Additional FLSA overtime pay entitlementsderiving from the payment of a quarterly retention allowance will be paidat the same time the allowance is paid. The allowance may be as much as 20 percent of an employee's base pay. Alleligible employees will receive the maximum allowance percentage for thefirst full year of the project. However, the Director of the Office ofPersonnel Management (OPM) and the Secretary of Transportation will periodicallyassess the progress made toward the project's objectives. The Secretary,in consultation with the Director of OPM, may cap allowances below 20%or may discontinue the allowances altogether. The Secretary's decisionsmay apply uniformly to all covered positions or may differentiate amongsites, occupations or grade levels. Furthermore, the Secretary may authorizethe Administrator of FAA to set allowances, for all or for certain categoriesof covered positions, on an individual, case-by-case basis. The percentageof the allowance in effect at the time an employee moves into a coveredposition will not be reduced or discontinued for that employee for at leastone year, unless a lower percentage applicable to that employee is determinedto be appropriate because of the implementation of special salary ratesor legislation which would offset the lower percentage. Although it does not require waiver of laws or regulations, this personnelsystem change is being conducted as a demonstation project because it involvesa modification of the current pay system and provides retention allowancesas an alternative to other pay adjustments. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Project Goals</ITAG>The demonstration retention allowance is intended to achieve two primarygoals: (1) to attract a sufficient number of experienced, qualified employeesto apply for positions at the selected hard-to-staff facilities; and (2)to retain experienced, qualified employees at these facilities. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Participating Facilities</ITAG>Numerous factors were considered when determining which hard-to-staff facilitiescould be included in the project. Primary consideration was given to thefacility's staffing difficulties, as characterized by staffing levels,turnover, experience levels of employees, and overtime. The facilitiesselected have chronic difficulty in attracting and retaining experiencedemployees. They are also among the facilities with the most significantimpact on the national aviation system. The following facilities have been selected to participate in the demonstrationproject: Farmingdale Flight Standards District Office, Farmingdale, New York (includesManufacturing Inspection District Office). New York Air Route Traffic Control Center, Ronkonkoma, New York. New York Terminal Radar Approach Control, Westbury, New York. New York Flight Standards District Office, Valley Stream, New York.Teterboro Flight Standards District Office, Teterboro, New Jersey (includesManufacturing Inspection District Office). Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center, Aurora, Illinois. Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois (includes Air TrafficControl Tower, Terminal Radar Approach Control, and Chicago Airway FacilitiesSector). Coast Terminal Radar Approach Control, Santa Ana, California. Los Angeles Flight Standards District Office, Los Angeles, California.Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles, California (includes AirTraffic Control Tower and Terminal Radar Approach Control). Oakland Bay Terminal Radar Approach Control, Oakland California. Other facilities may be added to the project during the course of the 5-yeardemonstration period. The process for adding facilities will be the Secretary'srecommendation, the OPM Director's approval and the publication of a noticein the <T4>Federal Register </T4>at least 30 days in advance of the start of thefirst quarter of eligibility. <ITAG tagnum="81">F. Participating Employees </ITAG>For all of the facilities except the Flight Standards District Officesand Manufacturing Inspection District Offices, all employees officiallyassigned to covered facilities and occupying the following positions willbe covered by the demonstration project: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1>Position Title</H1><H1>Pay Plan, Series, and Grade</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Airway Facilities Sector Manager <D>GM-301-15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Assistant Sector Manager <D>GM-301-13/14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Supervisory Computer Operator <D>GS-332-10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Computer Operator <D>GS-332-5/9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Supervisory General Engineer <D>GM-801-14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">General Engineer <D>GS-801-5/13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Supervisory Engineering Technician <D>GS-802-11/12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Engineering Technician <D>GS-802-5/12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mechanical Engineer <D>GS-830-5/13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Supervisory Electronics Engineer <D>GM-855-13/14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Electronics Engineer <D>GS-855-5/13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Supervisory Electronics Technician <D>GM-856-13/15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Electronics Technician <D>GS-856-5/13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Supervisory Air Traffic Control Specialist (Center and Terminal optionsonly) <D>GM-2152-14/15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Air Traffic Control Specialist (Center and Terminal options only) <D>GS-2152-4/14</D></ITAG>For the Flight Standards District Offices and Manfacturing Inspection DistrictOffices, all employees officially assigned to covered facilities and occupyingthe following positions will be covered:<ITAG tagnum="3">Aviation Cabin Safety Specialist </ITAG><D>GS-1801-5/14</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Supervisory Aviation Safety Inspector </ITAG><D>GS-1825-14/15</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Aviation Safety Inspector </ITAG><D>GS-1825-5/14</D></ITAG>Other positions may be added during the course of the porject. The processfor adding positions will be the same as that for adding facilities. Theaddition of new facilities and positions may not cause the number of coveredemployees to exceed 5,000. Total current employment in these positionsat the participating facilities is approximately 2,114. Current employmentstatistics for the selected facilities, itemized by series and grade, areprovided in Appendix A.<ITAG tagnum="81">G. Labor Participation</ITAG>The employees covered by this project are in exclusive bargaining unitsrepresented by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA),representing approximately 55.4 percent of covered employees, the ProfessionalAirway Systems Specialists (PASS) representing approximately 16.1 percentof covered employees, and the American Federation of Government Employees(AFGE) Local 2791 representing approximately 3.0 percent of covered employees.Meetings to brief all three organizations on the details of the projectwere held in late September and early October, 1988. Further consultationsand negotiations with NATCA and PASS took place during the comment periodfor this project, and memoranda of understanding have been completed withboth unions. AFGE and FAA have consulted on the project. Approximately25.5 percent of covered employees are not represented by bargaining units.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Methodology</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">A. Project Design</ITAG>The purpose of a demonstration project is to test changes under controlledconditions before making commitments to put them into effect for a widerpopulation of Federal employees. The project is a simple before/after designand much of the analysis will rely on pre/post measures. However, effortswill be made to make comparisons between this treatment and alternativetreatments for comparable staffing problems at other Federal agencies.Validation of the project intervention will also be done through comparisonwith system-wide information.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Selection of Demonstration Sites</ITAG>The facilities which have been selected are part of a larger group of FAAfacilities which have experienced staffing problems. However, in orderto remedy intractable staffing shortages and to encourage movement of experiencedemployees to covered facilities, the project must be limited to those situationswhere the need is most critical. Among the factors considered in selectingfacilities were staffing levels, turnover, experience levels, and overtimeuse. The facilities included in the project have chronic difficulties inattracting and retaining experienced employees and are recognized as havinga major impact on the operation of the nation's aviation system.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Project Implementation and Training</ITAG>While the project does not affect training directly, it is expected toresult in decreased training requirements because the overall experiencelevel is expected to rise. There will be more fully qualified employeesand fewer trainees.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Project Duration</ITAG>The demonstration project will begin no sooner than 90 days after the dateof this final notice. After implementation, the project will be conductedfor a period of up to five years. During this period, the staffing situationat each facility participating in the project will be closely monitoredand analyzed. After the five-year active stage of the project, the overallresults will be analyzed to determine the success of the project in fulfillingthe stated objectives and goals.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Evaluation Plan</ITAG>A comprehensive and methodologically rigorous evaluation will be implemented.The results will be reviewed by an external consultant to assess the meritsof this experiment.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Evaluation Phases</ITAG>The demonstration project will be evaluated in three phases: (1) implementationevaluation, (2) experimental evaluation, and (3) summative evaluation.<T3>Implementation Evaluation.</T3> Once the project has begun, the monitoringof the implementation phase will begin. This is needed to ensure that theproject is being implemented in a standardized fashion and that the statedprocesses are in fact operational. Following the project implementationphase, a report will be issued by the evaluation team detailing all aspectsof the implementation and offering suggestions on how to improve the implementation.Any changes made to the design during the implementation will be carefullydocumented and the design revised accordingly. The report will be submittedto project officials, the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, andthe Office of Personnel Management.<T3>Experimental Evaluation. </T3>The evaluation of the experimental phasewill begin as soon as the project is determined to be operational and stable.Data collection initiated prior to implementation will continue on a quarterlybasis as outlined in the evaluation model. Reports analyzing the effectsof the project will be issued by the evaluator on at least an annual basis.These reports will be submitted to the Office of the Secretary of Transportationand the Office of Personnel Management.<T3>Summative Evaluation. </T3>Upon conclusion of the experimental phaseof the project, an overall assessment of the combined effects of the demonstrationproject will be made. Impacts of overall system changes will be discussedat this point.Cause-and-effect relationships will be established to the extent possible,using pre- and post-demonstration data. The effectiveness of the projectin meeting the stated objectives will be assessed. Efforts will be madeto include an assessment of unanticipated positive as well as negativeeffects. A final project report will be issued by the evaluation team andmade available to the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, the demonstrationproject sites, and the Office of Personnel Management.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Evaluation Design</ITAG><T3>Overview and Rationale. </T3>The demonstration project is intendedto improve staffing levels, experience levels, and retention in safety-relatedoccupations in hard-to-staff facilities. Turnover rates and overtime usageare expected to drop. These improvements are expected to result from thepayment of a retention allowance of up to 20 percent of base pay to employeesin the covered occupations and sites.FAA's Office of the Associate Administrator for Human Resource Management(AHR), Office of Management Systems (AMS), the Civil Aeromedical Institute(CAMI), and OPM worked together to design an evaluation plan to measurethe effects of the project. The evaluation will measure the extent to whichretention, recruitment, staffing levels, experience levels, turnover, andovertime usage are improved during the demonstration.Three years' baseline data (for Fiscal Years 1986, 1987, and 1988) is beingcollected for the facilities involved in the test. This data will includemeasures of all the indices used to assess the impact of the demonstrationproject.Table 1 summarizes the effects expected from the project, the measuresthat will be used to assess those effects, and the data sources for themeasures. Additions and adjustments to this model may be made during theevaluation phase as required.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,r10,12</C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Evaluation Model</T4><H1>Expected Effects</H1><H1>Measures</H1><H1>Data Sources</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Increased staffing levels<D>Percent of goal</D><D>\1\ CPMIS</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Number of vacant positions</D><D>Regions</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Increased experience levels<D>Average tenure</D><D>CPMIS</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Percent of FPL's/fully qualified employees</D><D>CPMIS</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Reduced turnover<D>Turnover rate</D><D>CPMIS</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Reduced overtime<D>Average hours per week per employee</D><D>\2\ CUPS</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Reduced sick leave<D>Average hours per week per employee</D><D>CUPS</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Improved morale<D>Job satisfaction</D><D>\3\ Survey</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Improved productivity<D>Operations per employee</D><D>CUPS/CPMIS</D><F>\1\ Consolidated Personnel Management Information System</F><F>\2\ Consolidated Uniform Payroll System</F><F>\3\ Survey Feedback Action Program</F></ITAG></ITAG><T3>Methods, Measures, and Data Sources. </T3>The primary method of analysiswill be an Hotelling's T test of the differences between the before andafter measures. The multivariate version of the T test considers the interrelationshipsamong the outcome measures. For example, improving staffing levels couldaffect the turnover rate, sick leave usage, and morale. The experimentalhypothesis states that after the implementation of the allowance, the measureswill show comparatively better staffing, experience levels, turnover, overtimeusage, sick leave usage, morale, and productivity. As data are collectedannually, time series tests will be performed to gauge the effects of theallowance over time. Separate analyses will be performed for each occupationalgroup (e.g., Air Traffic, Airway Facilities, Flight Standards) to determineif the project has different effects for one group than for another. Similarinformation will also be obtained on a system-wide basis for comparisonwith the covered facilities, in order to assess the impact of externalfactors not associated with the demonstration project. It is recognizedthat selection of extreme cases for the experimental groups lends itselfto the problem of regression to the mean. This will be considered whenresults are analyzed.<T3>Data Collection and Analysis Plan. </T3>The data collection instruments/databases, major areas covered by each instrument/data base, schedule for datacollection, and source for each instrument/data base are summarized inTable 2.Each of the analyses described below will assess changes occurring at eachtest site and system-wide during the demonstration as compared to the baselineperiod (i.e., pre-demonstration period).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s25,xls40,r10,r10</C><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Data Collection and Analysis Plan</T4><H1>Database</H1><H1>Collector</H1><H1>Schedule</H1><H1>Source</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">CPMIS <D>AHR </D><D>Baseline </D><D>Automated records system.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Staffing<P>Turnover</P><P>Experience </P><D/> <D>Quarterly during demonstration </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">CUPS <D>AMS </D><D>Baseline </D><D> Automated records system.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Overtime<P>Sick leave </P><D/> <D>Quarterly during demonstration </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Survey <D>CAMI </D><D>Biennial </D><D>Survey database.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Operations/employee <D>AHR </D><D>Baseline </D><D>Existing automated and manual records systems.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/> <D>Quarterly during demonstration </D></ITAG>V. Costs  The estimated costs for the demonstration project for the first year areapproximately $20.1 million for the covered facilities, based on currentpay rates. The estimated cost of the allowance will vary over the durationof the project but in no case should exceed $24.4 million for the identifiedfacilities, based on current pay rates. This estimate assumes little changein job market conditions and an increase in employment levels at the participatingfacilities. Detailed cost estimates by facility are included in AppendixB. These costs will be offset somewhat by the anticipated reduction inovertime and savings associated with reduced turnover, such as reducedpermanent-change-of-station travel. The demonstration project also avoidscosts that would be incurred by alternative solutions.VI. Benefits  The retention allowances are expected to result in the following benefitsfor the FAA:  andbullet; Full and stable employment at the selected facilities. The agencyshould be able to attract a larger number of experienced employees to theparticipating facilities. Once they are on board at the facilities, employeesshould be more likely to remain there for a longer period of time, andturnover will therefore be reduced.andbullet; More experienced employees occupying safety-related positions/highernumbers of full-performance-level (FPL) employees. The allowance shouldenable the agency to attract a larger number of fully-trained employeesfrom other facilities. These employees will need less training to becomefully qualified than new employees hired from outside the agency. Reducedturnover among employees will also increase experience levels.andbullet; Reduced overtime. Higher staffing levels, reduction in turnover,higher experience levels, and more full-performance-level employees shouldresult in a reduction in overtime use. These benefits in turn should helpto ensure a continued high level of safety. All of these benefits may notbe experienced at all of the participating facilities, since the staffingproblems and their causes vary among the facilities.VII. Responsibilities  The Office of Personnel Management has overall responsibility for designingand implementing the valuation plan (5 U.S.C. section 4703(1)(H)) and formonitoring the evaluation. FAA's Office of the Associate Administratorfor Human Resource Management (AHR) will have responsibility for conductingand coordinating the evaluation to ensure that it is accomplished as planned.Responsibility for data collection will be shared by the particpating facilities,regional offices, the organizations responsible for agency databases, FAA'sOffice of Management Systems (AMS), and OPM. Analysis of data will be theresponsibility of AHR and AMS, with additional support to be provided bycontractor organizations. Data will also be supplied to OPM on request. Reports will be provided by AHR to the FAA Administrator, the Secretaryof Transportation, and the Office of Personnel Management, as well as tothe air traffic facilities, airway facilities, and aviation standards organizationsin FAA. The reports will be provided in a summary manner on an annual basis.At the end of the demonstration project, a final report will be preparedwhich provides an analysis of the overall results of the demonstrationproject and recommendations for action.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix A._Employees Covered by Demonstration Project</ITAG>On-board figures as of January, 1989:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>9,L2,i1,s25,r10,r10,r10,r10,r10,r10,r10,r10</C><T4>Airway Facilities</T4><H1>  </H1><H1>N.Y.
