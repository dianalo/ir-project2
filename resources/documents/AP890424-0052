Forty to 50 protesters, the last of up to 100 who had occupiedthe student services center since April 12, left the buildingSunday.   ``I'm happy, but I also know that what was done here is notnecessarily the end of what must be done to correct injustices tomembers of my race,'' said Walter Boykin, a sophomore from Detroit.   The university granted the students amnesty for the takeover andallowed them to complete missed course work, said Wayne Statespokesman Vern Foss.   Dalmas Taylor, dean of liberal arts and the school's chiefnegotiator during the protest, said the students accomplished mostof what they set out to do.   ``The students presented the university with a list of 17proposals. Among them was some that brought our attention toserious needs,'' Taylor said. ``Some of them we were aware of.''   Students agreed to drop a demand that black studies courses betaught only by blacks, a requirement officials said would beillegal.   The student services building houses offices that handlefinancial aid, registration and records. It was closed during thetakeover but not damaged.   Blacks make up 27 percent of Wayne State's 30,000 students.   The university agreed to create 10 new full-time scholarshipsfor blacks and increase the number of black faculty members from 99to 113 within three years.   That would raise the percentage of blacks on the faculty to 8.7percent, which officials said was three times the national averagefor universities.   The university also agreed to elevate the school's Center forBlack Studies to a full department and budget $452,500 for the1989-90 school year. The Center for Black Studies received $163,000in 1988-89.   ``I believe we accomplished a lot,'' said Eric Dulan, a freshmanfrom Detroit. ``We broadened the department of black studies, whichwe needed to do. The classes are so full, sometimes you have to goin and stand up.''   ``We showed them we were serious, and we remain serious.''</TEXT></DOC>
