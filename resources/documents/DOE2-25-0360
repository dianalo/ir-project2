Such a forecast is not so obvious: at first, thereference period is long for a world which evolves rapidly. Besides,this forecast is function of the evolution of different parameters (demography,economic welfare..., etc.) as well as uneasily manageable political events(oil crisis, strifes, etc.). The use of each energy vector varies accordingto the country and to the time: on one hand, each country has differentavailabilities (fuel oil, gas, coal, hydropower,... etc.) and on theother hand the life span for profit earning exploitation of depositschanges according to the consumption rates: firewood has practicallygiven out, fuel oil must be reserved for developing countries and specificuses such as transportation and petrochemistry. On the contrary the gas,electricity and nuclear energy development rates increase sharply. Evenwith large mines, coal seems to stand by, waiting for better days, butbeing sure of its long term use. This evolution is slow but ineluctable.Fossil fuel reserves give out progressively. Countries must find solutionsfor the day after to morrow: nuclear fusion. Solar energy. Or easiercoal and/or nuclear energy. The desire of people for a decent standardof living leads to growing needs for food and energy: Third World debt,significant energy choices (coal - nuclear for example), desert expansionand environment are parameters which have to be taken into account forenergy planning. Together with CIFOPE and AFME, we are grateful to PlanBleu which has been looking into these matters for several years. Wewere obliged to think over these problems; they are essential for thesurvival of this region which has the cradle of worldwide civilizations.</TEXT></DOC>
