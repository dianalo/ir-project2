Rescuers halted the search for survivors atan earthquake-flattened freeway when the rubble became too unstable.   And hospital officials said today survivor Buck Helm hadimproved and they were considering upgrading his condition fromcritical to very serious. Doctors said he was no longer in pain,and they were hopeful the longshoreman pulled from the freewayrubble would not have permanent kidney problems.   ``In the next 24 to 48 hours, if he continues the way he is now,he will be out of the woods,'' Dr. Floyd Huen said.   The death toll rose to 61 today with the recovery of two morebodies in San Francisco, the coronor's office said. A female bodywas found in the remains of a Marina district fire, and a68-year-old woman died of injuries suffered from the quake neardowntown. Dozens remained missing and thousands were injured andhomeless.   At the Interstate 880 disaster in Oakland, where 38 bodies havebeen recovered, officials said today crews began dismantling a100-yard section of the double-deck freeway that was near collapse.   ``It is a dangerous operation,'' said Kyle Nelson, a spokesmanfor the California Department of Transportation.   Congress began putting together a $3 billion-plus package offederal disaster, but put off until later how to come up with themoney to pay for it.   ``There is an urgent need for help for people now,'' Sen. PeteWilson, R-Calif., told the Senate Environment and Public Workssubcommittee on transporation and resources.   Gale warnings were posted early today, rain was heavy in someareas and one ferry was turned back because of rough waters on theSan Francisco Bay, authorities said. The Union Ferry Building, theterminus of all ferries when they reach San Francisco, was closedfor an hour because of high waves and the boats were diverted to apier about a mile away.   But most made it to work without major problem, despitepredictions of commuter gridlock on the first full workday sincethe earthquke closed crucial freeways and broke a section of thevital Bay Bridge linking San Francisco and Oakland.   ``Considering everything, my commute has really gone smooth,''said Maggie Faulkner of Oakland, who rode a ferry across the choppybay to San Francisco.   Highway 101 was a sea of lights starting shortly after 5 a.m.PDT and the Golden Gate Bridge was bumper-to-bumper but moving. BayArea Rapid Transit, which runs trains underneath the bay, hadcarried 70,000 passengers by 8:30 a.m., more than double the normalload.   Damage estimates from Tuesday's earthquake topped $7 billion,eclipsing Hurricane Hugo as the costliest natural disaster in U.S.history, according to the Independent Insurance Agents of America.   On Sunday, 150 residents of a housing project just 10 feet fromcollapsed I-880 joined thousands of homeless because of fears thatmore of the highway could fall.   The unstable ruins forced authorities to halt rescue work lateSunday.   ``We know there are more victims, more cars. But we don't knowhow many,'' said California Highway Patrol Capt. Mike Garver,speaking about I-880.   There was no estimate of when work could resume.   ``It's kind of minute by minute,'' said Nelson.   The first phase of the Bay Bridge repair started when workerssawed a 50-foot collapsed section in half and lowered both halves200 feet by crane Sunday to a barge on wind-whipped San FranciscoBay.   Without the Bay Bridge, 65,000 rush-hour motorists were forcedto seek other ways to work. Daily, 260,000 cars use the bridge, themost crucial of the region's earthquake-disrupted roadways. Repairswill take at least four weeks.   ``You just can't squeeze all the traffic onto other bridges.There just isn't enough room,'' said Joel Markowitz, a trafficplanner with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. ``We'regoing to have a crisis until people adapt a little.''   Traffic planners took extraordinary precautions to avoidrush-hour paralysis on the first full workday since the earthquake.   Commuters were urged to take public transportation, buddy up incarpools and come in earlier or later than normal. Fourteen ferrieswere added to ease the bridge crisis, and extra police and towtrucks were placedin choke zones in case something goes wrong.   About 3 million people commute on a typical workday in thenine-county region. Authorities warned that 2 million of them couldbe disrupted in a nightmarish obstacle course.   MTC Chairman Rod Diridon said any motorist driving alone wouldbe ``doing an anti-social act.''   Extra subway trains and ferries can accommodate an additional45,000 riders. Other bridges must handle the rest of the trafficthat normally crosses the 8.5-mile-long Bay Bridge.   Other freeways also are devastated. A 1\-mile section of I-880is flattened, and the Embarcadero Freeway and the I-280 extensionare closed. Farther south, landslide-clogged Highway 17 is openonly to buses and emergency vehicles.   The hospital where Helm was taken was deluged with flowers,telegrams and phone calls for a survivor who had been given up fordead.   Helm, 57, regained some functions in his kidneys, which weredamaged by dehydration during his 89-hour ordeal. He was alsobreathing better, but he was still having trouble moving his legand was being fed by a tube in intensive care, said officials atOakland's Highland General Hospital.   Highway engineer Steven Whipple, the hero who found Helm, saidhe was checking the ruins for stability when he spotted the back ofHelm's head and a slight movement in his flashlight's beam.   ``It stopped my heart,'' said Whipple, 29, who works for thestate transportation department.   In six subsequent sweeps of the section, sniffing dogs andsensitive listening devices failed to detect any more survivors.   Rescuers were clearly buoyed at finding someone alive after fourgrisly days of removing bodies and crushed cars from the crumpledconcrete. They placed giant airbags, hydraulic jacks and woodentimbers under concrete slabs and trucked in dirt to firm thefoundation. They also installed seismic monitors on the structure.   Meanwhile, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday reportedmajor cracks in three dams within five miles of the epicenter inthe Santa Cruz Mountains, but said they posed ``no public threat atthis time'' because water is low behind them.   A half-dozen tent cities have sprouted in Watsonville, a city of30,000 about 80 miles south of San Francisco. Many residents wereso frightened by the quake and its aftershocks that they refuse togo indoors, even if their homes have been declared safe.   The Red Cross even opened a full-blown shelter of olive-greenmilitary tents, complete with medical and feeding facilities, inthe battered community.   Resumption of the World Series, the first ever between the twoBay area teams, was pushed back until Friday. It had been hopedplay would resume three days earlier.   Football was played Sunday, but not in San Francisco. The 49ersbeat the New England Patriots 37-20 in a game moved fromCandlestick Park to Stanford University, and a collection was takenamong the 75,000 fans for earthquake victims. A moment of silencehonored the dead.   Throughout the region, Sunday was a time for mourning the deadand giving thanks for survival.   ``We pray to be spared from further suffering,'' Archbishop JohnQuinn told 700 worshipers at St. Mary's Cathedral in San Francisco.``I pray for the relief of suffering and anxiety. I cannot forgetto pray for the dead and the bereaved.''   In Oakland, parishioners of the St. Francis de Sales Cathedralheld services in a Baptist church because their tower had beencracked and leaned precariously.   ``Sometimes in life, God shakes us and says, `Pay attention,there is something more important than the ordinary things in ourlives,'' the Rev. Joseph Powers said.</TEXT></DOC>
