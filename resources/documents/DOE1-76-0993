Undetectable link failureis consistent with the standard model of distributed algorithms in whichlink delays can be arbitrary but finite. They give an algorithm thatcorrectly solves the problem when the links fail before or during theexecution of the algorithm. Let n be the number of nodes in the network,f be the maximum number of faulty links, and r be a design parameter.The algorithm uses no more than O(nrf + (nr/(r - 1)) log (n/(r - 1)f))messages, runs in time O(n/(r - 1)f), and uses at most O(log verticalbar T vertical bar) bits per message, where vertical bar T vertical baris the cardinality of the set of node identifiers.</TEXT></DOC>
