The administrative judge's decision said the government hasn't shown why its investigations require that the protest be suspended.    Consideration of ATandamp;T's protest had been suspended so that protest proceedings before the General Services Administration's board of contract appeals wouldn't conflict with investigations by the Justice Department and the GSA's inspector general. The government is investigating whether, as ATandamp;T alleges, the GSA improperly favored competitors of ATandamp;T in awarding the contract.    In his order yesterday, the GSA administrative judge said information about the Justice Department's investigation hasn't been forthcoming enough to merit continued suspension of the ATandamp;T protest. &quot;The government has not provided sufficient information for us to conclude that futher suspension is necessary,&quot; the order said. ATandamp;T said it was pleased with the judge's order and anticipated it will resume taking depositions in the matter Jan. 19.    But the order did apparently jog the GSA into stepping up its investigation. ATandamp;T said that yesterday it received a subpoena from the GSA inspector general asking for records of all meetings, conversations and negotiations by ATandamp;T executives involved with the company's bid on the contract. &quot;We are pleased that the judge is putting this matter on the front burner,&quot; an ATandamp;T spokesman said.    The government inquiries stem from a protest filed by ATandamp;T in October with the GSA's board of contract appeals, alleging that GSA officials discriminated against ATandamp;T in awarding a dozen switches. ATandamp;T said it won bids for four switches in which it was the sole bidder, and one switch in which it faced opposing bids. Bell Atlantic Corp., U S West Inc., BellSouth Corp. and Pacific Telesis Group won contracts for the other seven switches.    Telecommunications industry executives believe that the awarding of the $55 million contract could affect the awarding of a much bigger, 10-year government contract that could have a value of as much as $25 billion. If GSA contracting officers are found to have skewed the awards for the $55 million contract, it would raise questions about the impartiality of the bid for the larger contract, called FTS-2000.    In addition, some industry sources believe switches contracted for under the smaller order can be used to run FTS-2000 services, thus giving winners of the $55 million contract a cost advantage in bidding for the FTS-2000 contract. The Bell companies are bidding in a team against ATandamp;T for the FTS-2000 contract. Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio), chairman of the government affairs committee, is also investigating the awarding of the $55 million contract. </TEXT></DOC>
