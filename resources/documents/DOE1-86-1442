The main attention is given to the photoprocesses, for which themanifestations of the intershell interaction are studied both experimentallyand theoretically. The strong effect of many-electron shells upon thefew-electron ones is demonstrated on a number of concrete examples bycomparing the results of different calculations and existing experimentaldata for partial cross sections of ionization, photoelectron angulardistributions and a degree of polarization. General qualitative featuresof intershell interaction manifestations are discussed as well as theirdifferences in the atoms with closed and open shells. The atomic electronshell rearrangement due to a vacancy formation is considered just astheir influence upon intershell interaction.</TEXT></DOC>
