It fosters that image bytrumpeting its Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award fromthe U.S. government and Nikkei Prize for manufacturing fromJapan.   But in the booming $2-billion-a-year market for computermicroprocessors, the &quot;brain&quot; chips that run the machines,Motorola is winning booby prizes.</LP><TEXT>   For a decade, it has trailed archrival Intel Corp. Lastyear it lost more market share by delaying improvements onits aging line of microprocessors. Today only one personalcomputer in 10 has a Motorola brain chip, and there's only a28% chance, down from 79% in 1985, that an engineer's newworkstation uses a Motorola microprocessor.   That isn't all. Motorola also is paying heavily forfumbling work on a new, speedier chip.   Thus, both Motorola's old and its new chip lines are beinghit by major computer customers' defections, to Intel and totwo upstarts, Sun Microsystems Inc. and Mips Computer SystemsInc.   How could Motorola, one of America's most admiredcompanies and a master maker of other types of chips and ofcellular phones, slide into such a predicament?   One reason is paradoxical: Motorola's obsession withtechnological excellence delayed new products at criticaltimes. The other reason is an all-too-familiar case ofinfighting between champions of a new technology anddefenders of a successful older one. Backers of Motorola'solder microprocessors, the 68000 line, won crucial internalbattles in the 1980s, and they siphoned off resources neededto develop a new, high-speed-chip technology, the so-calledreduced-instruction-set computing. This RISC technology isfaster because it combines more sophisticated circuitstructures with more simplified internal software.   &quot;We ran into a classic bureaucratic self-preservationreaction,&quot; recalls Roger Ross, who designed the RISC chip andlater left Motorola in anger. Today's leader of thenow-burgeoning RISC market, Sun, once considered abandoningits own chip in favor of Mr. Ross's. The Ross chip, calledthe 88000, didn't reach the market until 1989, more than ayear behind rival RISC chips.   &quot;If I had to do it over again, I would have startedearlier&quot; on RISC, concedes Murray Goldman, who headsMotorola's microprocessor and memory group.   Motorola's mistakes hit at a bad time, a once-in-a-decadejuncture when computer makers are choosing new chips to powerfuture computers. Motorola &quot;kind of lost the recipe in thelast couple of years,&quot; says Willem Roelandts, vice presidentof Hewlett-Packard Co.'s networked-systems group. In fact,H-P, a big Motorola customer, delayed a new computer morethan six months because Motorola was late with its newversion of the 68000 series.   Motorola's mistakes aren't fatal. It still earns profitson microprocessors and dominates a larger market forprocessors that control products other than computers,ranging from car engines to washing machines. Itsmicroprocessor sales are estimated at $500 million a year;its entire line of chips accounted for 30% of its $10.9billion revenue last year.   Moreover, Mr. Goldman is optimistic that the delayed newentry in its 68000 line, the 68040, will reclaim markets;Motorola finally started shipping the chip in volume lastNovember.   And he contends that the snubbed 88000 RISC chip is theonly one that can take markets from Intel. Motorola isbetting that Apple Computer Inc., which now uses 68000-familychips, will plug the new RISC chip into its future Macintoshmachines, spurring other computer makers to use it and makingit a de facto standard.   But most computer experts give Motorola a slim chance ofgaining ground on Intel, Sun or Mips in computers.   Its problems started around 1980, when InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. needed a chip to power its personalcomputer. Intel launched a marketing blitz, Operation Crush,to flog a microprocessor that it now concedes was inferior toMotorola's. IBM chose Intel's chip, which became the PCstandard and now accounts for 80% of that market, comparedwith 9.7% for Motorola's, according to Dataquest Inc. Thatdominance spurred Intel's growth and compensated for its ownslow entry into RISC technology; the first to market RISCchips were Mips and Sun, which calls its version the Sparcchip.   In 1985, Motorola did get a 79% share of the market forthe microprocessors used in workstations, but workstationsales are less than a tenth the size of the PC market. Threeyears ago, moreover, Motorola's strength in workstations alsobegan fading. Beginning in 1987, Motorola had promisedsignificant gains in speed from the next-generation 68040chip, but by 1989 the chip hadn't appeared.   That miscue illustrates one of Motorola's problems,computer makers say. Motorola customarily demands that itsengineers create the best-designed, fastest andhighest-quality product possible. But in the rapid-fire worldof computer chips, that strategy often made Motorola late tomarket. Mr. Goldman denies that that is a problem. &quot;I'm late{with the 68040} because we reached out so far,&quot; he says, but&quot;we have to leapfrog everybody.&quot;   Few observers agree. &quot;It's a major problem, a situationwhere their ongoing tendency to be late with the best hurtsthem,&quot; says James Barlage, a Smith Barney analyst.   In March 1989, Motorola tried to steal Intel's fire byannouncing the 68040 several weeks before Intel showed itsrival 80486. Computer experts praised Motorola's superiordesign, but, long after Intel had shipped its chip tocustomers, Motorola was still revising its own. Unlike Intel,Motorola waited until it had got most of the bugs out of itschip.   For months, Motorola's exasperated customers waited forchips for new computers. Unisys Corp. salesmen begandiverting customers to Intel-based machines. H-P, whichpredicted a year ago that 68040-based workstations woulddominate its sales, began saying it expects many customers toswitch to machines using H-P's own RISC chips. That hurtMotorola, which had already lost chip customers such asTandem Computers Inc., Silicon Graphics Inc. and Sony Corp.to Mips.   &quot;Not having the part two years ago set {Motorola} backirreparably in terms of keeping the Sparc and Mips guys fromgetting major chunks of the workstation business,&quot; saysMichael Slater, editor of Microprocessor Report, anewsletter.   Motorola might have been better off if it had heeded Mr.Ross, whom it had hired from NCR Corp. in 1983 to exploreRISC technology. Motorola could have kept the Sony account,for instance, if it had had a viable RISC chip, says AtholFoden, marketing manager for Sony's U.S. computer unit. Likeother manufacturers, Sony learned in 1988 that the 88000 wasonly on the drawing board while Mips and Sun had workingchips. But Motorola didn't push the 88000 hard, says JamesChristie, marketing vice president for Icon InternationalInc., which builds 88000 computers. &quot;It was the uglystepchild.&quot;   By 1986, Mr. Ross had designed a chip offering many timesthe power of Motorola's 68000 line. Mr. Ross says severalexecutives at the company's headquarters in Schaumburg, Ill.,were enthusiastic.   But in Austin, he says, officials froze the RISC team'sstaffing at five engineers even though it needed about 20more. He says he finagled extra staff by waylaying engineersrotating through a new-recruits program; he got 17 of themand says they were &quot;very critical&quot; to the project. Executivesalso skimped on his capital expenditures, he says, forcinghim to borrow computers from friends at Sun.   Mr. Ross's nemesis was Thomas Gunter, the father ofMotorola's 68000 chip. Mr. Ross says Mr. Gunter lobbiedagainst the RISC chip within Motorola and vied with him forcustomers. Mr. Ross says that he often went to a computermaker with data on the 88000's performance and that,afterward, &quot;Tom would come in and make the same claims forthe 68000.&quot;   Mr. Gunter, who refers to his relationship with Mr. Rossas &quot;that soap opera,&quot; won't say much about it. Mr. Goldmancalls Mr. Ross &quot;unprofessional&quot; and concedes the infightingwas damaging: &quot;We did have some jealousy back and forth.&quot;   The discord wasn't surprising, says James Norling, whoheads all of Motorola's chip businesses. &quot;Roger {Ross} wasconstantly beating the hell out of us&quot; for more resources, hesays, while the 68000 people, like any established group,were &quot;not going to volunteer for their successors to takeover their world.&quot;   Northern Telecom Inc.'s BN Research unit grew worried whenMotorola management appeared apathetic toward Mr. Ross'schip, which Northern planned to use in a phone switch. As theRoss-Gunter feud boiled up, &quot;I acted as a lobby on Roger'sbehalf,&quot; says John Perry, a Northern Telecom systems manager,who says he &quot;made it very clear that if they wanted to beleaders in high-end microprocessors they had to developRISC.&quot;   Motorola's bias toward the 68000 led to a loss that stillhaunts it. In 1985, Sun needed a new chip for itsnext-generation workstations. Because the 68000 chips Sunused didn't promise enough power, Sun engineers began todesign the Sparc chip. But Sun saw merit in buying from abig, stable chip maker, says Bernard Lacroute, then Sun'sexecutive vice president and now a partner in aventure-capital firm.   Sun discussed RISC options with Motorola between 1985 and1987, Mr. Lacroute says, and at one time was willing to usethe 88000 instead of its own Sparc. All Sun wanted from Mr.Goldman was a firm commitment to support the 88000, Mr.Lacroute says. Instead, he adds, Motorola kept pushing Sun tostay with the 68000.   &quot;They weren't putting enough resources soon enough&quot; intothe 88000, he says.   In 1987, Sun introduced its Sparc chip. The chip overtookthe 68000-family last year as the leader of workstationmicroprocessors, with 36% of the market, up from 1% in 1987.Sun, currently also the biggest maker of workstations, nowbuys only 2% of its microprocessors from Motorola -- downfrom 80% in 1988.   Another ironic twist: Mr. Ross, the father of Motorola's88000, is now president of Ross Technology Inc., which makesSparc chips.   As RISC technology rapidly gained favor, Motorola finallystepped up its work on the new chip, and its 88000 lookedpromising at its 1988 debut. Some 50 companies agreed to useit; many of them joined a Motorola-backed alliance that wasto assure that software for one 88000 computer could be usedon another. At the chip's coming-out party, Mr. Goldman saidit would bring &quot;vast&quot; new business.   The party didn't last. Companies that planned to use the88000 say Motorola didn't spend enough to get software makersto modify programs for it. Oracle Corp., for instance,finally modified its popular data-base program last year torun on the 88000, but only after the alliance paid for it.Motorola was also slow to provide software &quot;tools&quot; thatcomputer and software makers need to develop products aroundnew chips.   Motorola's schizophrenia lingered on. Its executivestouted the 88000's superiority, but marketers of the older68000 line made equally ambitious claims. Motorola frustratedcustomers by not making clear which chip it would push, saysHarry L. &quot;Nick&quot; Tredennick, who helped design the first 68000and now runs a chip-design business. &quot;I hadn't worked atMotorola for 10 years, and yet I was getting calls from theirlarge customers asking if I knew what Motorola was going todo,&quot; he writes in Microprocessor Report. &quot;I didn't, and Istill don't.&quot;   Few manufacturers chose the 88000, and many of those thatdid have defected. In 1989, Stratus Computer Inc. switched toIntel's RISC chip. Last year, NCR dropped plans for an 88000machine, Everex Systems Inc. scratched its 88000 computerafter few sales, and Tektronix Inc. said it was ditching itsworkstation business, which included plans for 88000machines. &quot;The picture certainly is bleak,&quot; says ThomasLacey, marketing vice president at Opus Systems, which usesthe 88000 in computer boards.   A further blow came last month. Officials close to CompaqComputer Corp. said the company formed an industry alliancethat would probably use the Mips chip for a new computerline. That dashed Motorola's hopes that Compaq would use the88000 and jump-start its sales.   Motorola isn't giving up. It has slashed its 88000 prices,built a $500 million factory to make the chip and is pumpingmoney into its 88000 alliance, which even rivals praise aswell-organized. Mr. Goldman says Motorola will get a liftthis year from the 88110, a faster, smaller version of the88000. &quot;I want to attack {Intel's market} with their owncustomers,&quot; he says. &quot;The 88110 is the weapon of choice; 1991is the time for the attack.&quot;   ---                     Motorola by the Numbers                                                                                                          Lines of busines as a percent of 1990 revenue of $10.88billion*                                                                                                        Communications                         31.4% Semiconductors                         30.2% Cellular phones                        23.3% Government electronics                  6.0% Information systems                     5.2% Other products                          3.9%                                                                                                          *Includes $476 million in adjustments and eliminations</TEXT></DOC>
