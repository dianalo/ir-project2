And when Raymond Mason, chairman of Legg, Mason, Wood, Walker Inc., overhears a snippet of corporate gossip at a cocktail party, he has been a broker long enough to know instantly if it's privileged information. &quot;For me, it's easy to define,&quot; he says. &quot;But the public is totally lost.&quot;    Even some Wall Street veterans see gray areas in the law, however. Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., for example, has vigorously contested the arrest of its top arbitrager, Robert Freeman, on insider-trading charges Feb. 12. &quot;We have no reason to believe that these allegations are in any way correct,&quot; a Goldman spokesman said recently.    While arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky and his confederates have made insider trading the crime of the '80s, all the publicity hasn't done much to dispel the widespread confusion about insider-trading law. Congress has never defined insider trading but court decisions have sketched the prohibitions against using inside information for personal gain.    For the layman, it's a legal morass, says securities lawyer Michael Klein. Honest business people, adds Harvey Pitt, a former general counsel of the Securities and Exchange Commission and one of Mr. Boesky's attorneys, are often in a quandary about the &quot;precise reach&quot; of the law.    In view of the insider-trading scandal and an impending Supreme Court decision, a growing number of lawyers, Wall Street executives and lawmakers now believe that Congress should adopt a statutory definition of insider trading to clarify things once and for all. Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee's securities panel, has asked a group of prominent attorneys, headed by Mr. Pitt, to come up with a &quot;plain-language, workable&quot; definition that &quot;hopefully we will be able to sell&quot; to Congress.    &quot;I think it's unacceptable that we can talk about sending people to jail and taking all of their property for a crime we can't define,&quot; asserts John Olson, a Washington-based partner in the Los Angeles law firm of Gibson, Dunn andamp; Crutcher and member of the Pitt group.    The SEC's long enforcement reach, coupled with the readiness of judges to mete out prison terms, has made Wall Street more uneasy about ambiguities in the case law. &quot;We don't want people to fall into the net just because they didn't know what was illegal,&quot; says Edward O'Brien, president of the Securities Industry Association.    Yesterday, the SIA urged Congress to spell out what type of misconduct should be subject to criminal sanctions. Deploring insider trading, Mr. O'Brien said SIA officials will work with the Pitt group or other drafters to come up with a workable definition.    Political support for a definition is also coming from those who favor toughening the already harsh penalties of the Insider Trading Sanctions Act, which didn't offer any definition.    The SEC has long been invoking the anti-fraud provisions of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act to prosecute abuses of &quot;informational advantage.&quot; Over the years, the SEC has extended its reach beyond corporate officers and other insiders to &quot;temporary insiders,&quot; such as investment bankers and lawyers, and others quite removed from the company involved.    The agency has relied on case-by-case litigation to establish its theory of &quot;misappropriation,&quot; which holds that it's illegal to trade on material, nonpublic information that has been misappropriated or obtained in breach of a fiduciary duty. What impels some lawmakers and others to seek a statutory definition is the potential legal fallout from the government's insider-trading case against former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans.    Next fall, the Supreme Court is due to hear arguments on the convictions of Mr. Winans and two others on charges that they conspired to profit from advance knowledge of Journal articles. Some lawyers expect the misappropriation theory to be thrown out. But SEC Chairman John Shad, who is planning to leave the agency this spring to become ambassador to the Netherlands, advises against adopting legislation before the court rules, probably in early 1988.    &quot;The courts are doing a good job of refining the definition,&quot; says Mr. Shad. &quot;I would rather have the benefit of the Supreme Court's decision before we go for a codification.&quot; While favoring legal clarity, he has misgivings about a definition. &quot;Once you get one, it doesn't take sophisticated minds long to figure out where the edges are,&quot; he says. Commissioner Aulana Peters agrees: &quot;I'm afraid we'll define ourselves into a box.&quot;    Still, Rep. Matthew Rinaldo (R., N.J.), ranking minority member on the House Commerce subcommittee on finance, wants the agency to submit a definition &quot;at the earliest possible moment.&quot; He and other lawmakers believe Congress should be prepared for an adverse ruling from the Supreme Court.    The SEC's enforcement chief, Gary Lynch, calls the complaints about cloudy law &quot;overblown.&quot; Mr. Boesky and others who made millions trading on inside information about impending takeovers &quot;weren't operating in a gray area,&quot; he points out. &quot;They knew they were breaking the law and they covered it up.&quot; Mr. Lynch says he would oppose any definition that narrows the case law or discards the misappropriation theory.    One of the theory's chief critics is Mr. Klein, a partner in the Washington law firm of Wilmer Cutler andamp; Pickering. &quot;Irrespective of whatever the Supreme Court decides, you need a definition,&quot; he says. &quot;The misappropriation doctrine is so laden with arcane concepts and artificial dividing lines that the layman couldn't possibly understand what's permitted and what's prohibited.&quot;    One simple approach, Mr. Klein says, would be to outlaw &quot;the unfair use of material, nonpublic information,&quot; and then let the courts decide what's unfair, material and nonpublic. Or the SEC could use its rule-making powers to resolve these questions, he says.    For a statutory definition to have any chance in Congress, the SEC and the securities industry will have to agree on a consensus bill. &quot;I think a consensus can be reached,&quot; says Theodore Levine, a Wilmer Cutler partner and member of the definition-drafting group. &quot;The climate is right.&quot;    The bill's sponsors will still have to win over Michigan Democrat John Dingell, the House Commerce Committee chairman, who favors waiting for the Winans decision. &quot;I see no need to define insider trading further at this time and give fertile legal minds opportunities to exploit loopholes.&quot;    ---                    Trading Cases   Sec enforcement actions against insider trading and amountof illegal profits given up or repaid:                                    Profits                 Cases            (In millions) 1986             30                   $38 1985             20                    17 1984             13                    12 1983             24                    11 1982             20                    33 Source: Securities and Exchange Commission annual reports</TEXT></DOC>
