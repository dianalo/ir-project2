A recent study by M.I.T. for A.G.A. of the operatingcharacteristics of certain of these plants using natural gas shown veryminor efficiency losses and no derating. In addition, such conversionsto natural gas involve a reduction in parasitic energy losses (e.g.,preheating and pumping oil). There have also been a number of conversionsfrom coal to gas - mostly in the 1950s and 1960s. Again, only minor efficiencylosses are encountered in converting coal boilers to gas (3 to 5 percent),and there is little or no derating. Offsetting benefits such as a reductionin the energy required to handle coal and run pollution control equipmentmay well negate any efficiency losses resulting from the conversion.The capital cost required to convert coal or oil boilers to full naturalgas capability are minimal - in the rang of $5 to$30 per kW. Althoughthis conversion market is not a premium value market in that competitionis with coal and resid, the volume potential is huge, and conversionscan be made very quickly. Given current spot market gas prices, as wellas evolving transportation possibilities, this conversion market offerssignificant immediate relief to the industry. Recent opportunities forcoal to gas conversions have been primarily in the industrial sector.In this sector, load factor, siting, and relative fuel price considerationsare much more favorable for natural gas.</TEXT></DOC>
