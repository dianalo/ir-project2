It intensifies suspicions that the president either knew what was going on or was oblivious to critical events of his presidency. Poindexter's appearance will be pivotal to Reagan's credibility. If the former national-security adviser corroborates major parts of North's story, it will be very hard for the White House to argue that North was running a rogue operation.    Reagan is further undermined by North's testimony that the president's close friend Casey was intimately involved. Intelligence officials say the then-CIA chief sometimes would see Reagan without the knowledge of his national-security advisers. North also raises the stakes for Shultz's appearance, and Meese faces especially intense questions because of the claim he knew of an early Iranian arms shipment.    Flip-flop: After insisting earlier in the week that Reagan was too busy to watch the hearing, the White House now says he &quot;has seen a good deal of it.&quot;    SUMMIT PLANNING lags as both sides maneuver for position.    &quot;We don't see any big substantive stumbling blocks,&quot; says one U.S. arms-control official, who still predicts a fall summit. But neither side wants to appear to be in a rush. U.S. officials emphasize skepticism to defuse conservative suspicions that they are pursuing an agreement at any price.    American strategists claim that with the Allies unenthusiastic about the deal, the pressure is on Gorbachev to bend. But the Soviets also play it coy. They backed away from a proposed Shultz-Shevardnadze meeting this week after first indicating they would go along. U.S. officials speculate they were irritated by a leak suggesting they would agree to further compromises.    A TRADE COMPROMISE Reagan could swallow may still emerge, officials say.    Administration strategists see the Senate bill as growing ever &quot;trashier&quot; this month as debate drags on and lawmakers attach more protectionist provisions. In some respects, the White House fears that the Senate version of the Gephardt amendment will be worse than the original. Mandatory import relief is regarded as sure veto bait.    But trade staffers still think a deal can be worked out in conference for a bill Reagan can sign. The hope, says one, is that &quot;cooler heads will prevail the longer this goes on.&quot; Officials think improving trade figures may give members some political protection for a more moderate bill. &quot;Senators are counting on the conference to save them from themselves,&quot; says one official.    &quot;Unless the bill is improved in conference,&quot; it will be vetoed, says GOP Sen. Packwood. &quot;So the bill will essentially be written in conference.&quot;    OLLIEGATE: North said he accepted the $16,000 security system and gate for his home -- paid for at least partly from proceeds of the Iran-Contra operation -- because he couldn't get government protection after Abu Nidal's threat. But the Secret Service says it could have done the job if North had simply obtained Reagan's approval. Kissinger and Regan got such aid in the past. &quot;If the president orders, we do it,&quot; a spokesman says.    ROSTENKOWSKI'S SURGERY for appendicitis further delays tax-bill action. Moreover, he is increasingly pessimistic that Reagan will sign any bill, even one that sticks only to modest excise-tax increases. Speaker Wright pushes a soak-the-rich bill to stake out political turf for 1988.    BROCK URGES Reagan aides to moderate opposition to a raft of labor-backed bills moving in Congress. The labor secretary fears that a confrontational strategy could lead to a series of Reagan defeats. Instead, he urges a bob-and-weave strategy, resisting some bills while seeking a deal on others.    PART OF THE PROBLEM: Georgia Rep. Barnard recently sent out two news releases in the same envelope. One attacked the House budget resolution for not cutting enough spending. The other was headlined &quot;Barnard's Favored Projects Pass in Energy/Water Appropriations Bill.&quot;    BEATING BORK is increasingly possible, Senate Democrats insist.    They believe they have a good shot at the 41 votes needed to sustain a filibuster against Reagan's Supreme Court nominee. Strong black opposition may affect important Southern Democrats like Heflin and Nunn. The other key is GOP moderates like Chafee, Durenberger and Heinz; the active opposition of former Ford cabinet member William Coleman, now head of the NAACP legal-defense fund, could help sway them.    As the Judiciary Committee focuses on the Bork hearings, scheduled to start Sept. 15, other Reagan judicial nominations could face delays. Republicans may also use the Bork hearings to tie up progress on the Democrats' fair-housing bill.    But Republicans believe the issue is perilous for the Democrats and, says White House pollster Wirthlin, is particularly &quot;a mine field for Biden.&quot;    MINOR MEMOS: Celebrating North's testimony, a satiric group sponsors a game show -- &quot;Wheel of Soldier of Fortune.&quot; The word puzzle says &quot;Reagan knew.&quot; . . . Celebrity plug? North's written statement invites the committee chairmen to &quot;sit down and have a Coors&quot; with him. Brewer Joseph Coors donated $60,000 to the Contras. . . . The Force is with it: A House proposal entitled &quot;Jobs for Employable Dependent Individuals&quot; becomes known as the Jedi bill. </TEXT></DOC>
