Though they may not noise it around, they'd be happy to see theFederal Reserve continue to tighten credit, even to the point ofslowing economic growth and restraining the number of new businessesand jobs.   Who are these anti-growth Scrooges? Well, chances are theirnumbers include at least some of your affable, law-abiding andpatriotic neighbors _ and maybe even you.   You would certainly qualify for inclusion in this group if, forinstance, you have a fixed-rate mortgage on your house, which wouldbe unaffected by any change in current interest rates, and a chunkof your savings in a floating-rate investment such as a money marketmutual fund.   A decade or two ago, it was generally agreed that only a bankercould love high interest rates. While the costs of borrowing wentup, savers got little benefit, since the government set limits onrates paid to depositors (as in the fabled 5\ percent savingsaccount).   But in the modern world of deregulated finance, all that haschanged. People who are fixed-rate borrowers and floating-rateinvestors see their incomes rise as interest rates go up, with noconcomitant increase in their expenses.   This viewpoint is by no means a unanimous one. Families withfloating-rate mortgages right now are bracing for a blow to theircheckbooks the next time their monthly payments are recalculated.   The impact is even more immediate on borrowers who have flockedto the popular home equity loans in the past few years.   With much home-equity credit, the interest cost goes up inlockstep with the prime lending rate, which jumped a full percentagepoint in February alone.   Also, owners of long-term interest-bearing investments such asbond mutual funds have seen the value of their principal eroded ashigher rates have pushed bond prices lower.   Holders of bank certificates of deposit, meanwhile, watch infrustration as the rates available on new CDs climb well above whatthey are getting on existing deposits that won't mature for anothersix months, a year or more.   Still, long-term rates have risen much less than short-term ratesin the past year or so.   ``In periods such as 1988 when short-term interest rates rosewhile long-term interest rates remained stable, the household sectordid very well,'' observed Richard Hoey, chief economist at DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc.   ``This pattern has been modified but not eliminated by the risein floating rate debt instruments (such as mortgages and home equityloans) in recent years.''   As savers and investors get more and more experience with thevagaries of interest-rate fluctuations, the people who create andsell financial products keep devising new approaches to thesituation.   The floating-rate CD, in various forms, is one prominent examplein the banking world.   A case in point among mutual funds is the Pilgrim Prime RateTrust, an investment company sponsored by the Pilgrim ManagementCorp. of Los Angeles.   It is set up to seek a monthly yield that fluctuates pretty muchin line with the prime rate, by investing in pieces of floating-ratebank loans known in the trade as ``loan participation interests.''   A possible drawback of this fund: a 3 percent sales charge upfront and an early withdrawal penalty for the first year afterpurchase make it more suitable for long-term investors than forpeople who like to move their money around rapidly with changingtrends in interest rates.   In any case, the creation of investments like these keeps thehigh-interest-rate fan club growing all the time.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thursday March 2</NOTE></DOC>
