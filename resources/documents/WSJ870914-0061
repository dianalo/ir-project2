It will carry two telecommunications satellites and the hopes of the European space industry.    The long-delayed launch, Ariane's 19th, marks the European rocket's resumption of flights after being grounded for more than 15 months. Technicians have redesigned the rocket's third-stage engine, whose failure last year forced technicians to blow up the rocket and its payload minutes after blastoff.    Officials at Arianespace, the commercial satellite-launching arm of the European space agency, describe this launch as a crucial venture that will determine the credibility of Ariane and of the entire European space program.    &quot;There are some rendezvous that you can't afford to miss,&quot; says Roland Deschamps, secretary-general of Arianespace. &quot;We have to succeed, not only this launch, but a series of launches, if we want our contracts to materialize.&quot;    At stake is a market estimated at $1 billion a year for the placing in geostationary orbit of some 200 telecomunications, meteorological, observation and military satellites between now and 1996. Last year's Challenger space shuttle tragedy and President Reagan's subsequent decision to all but end the shuttle's role as a commercial satellite-launcher places Ariane in a favorable position, but it is far from alone in vying for the business.    Scurrying to fill the gap left by the space shuttle and Ariane accidents, the Soviet Union and China have made bids to launch Western satellites and Japan has announced plans to launch a powerful new rocket in 1992. &quot;The game is completely open,&quot; says Mr. Deschamps. </TEXT></DOC>
