Scanner.andM;Two Macintosh IIs form the retrieval station, Estes said, and both areequipped with 5M RAM and 40M hard disks.andP;  One of the stations is equippedwith a full-page color monitor and the other has a standard 8-bit colormonitor.andP;  &quot;Once we get the system up and running, we'll probably add moreretrieval stations,&quot; Estes said.andM;A beta version of the system is now operating, he said and a prototype systemshould be running sometime this month.andM;MARS software controls the scanner, directory and archive servers and WORMdrive, Estes said.andP;  A researcher using the system first will use the databaseat one of the two retrieval stations.andM;If the original documentation is required, the researcher will access theMARS software from the same computer to retrieve the information.andM;Estes and Stains reported the groups are working on HyperCard hooks to theMARS system but could not go into details because it still is very early indevelopment.andM;The university's system also has an Apple LaserWriter II NT laser printer toprint out copies of the documents stored on the system.andP;  Estes said copiesproduced from the scanned images often are in much better shape than theoriginal documents.andM;Masters said the original documents, stored in a 10-by 20-foot room &quot;full offolders,&quot; now are contained on four 12-inch optical disks.andM;Although the MARS system can include an optional optical character reader,the university's system does not include one.andP;  The paper records consistmostly of handwritten reports &quot;that we even have trouble reading,&quot; Masterssaid, and the group decided that optical character readers were not developedsufficiently for this type of application.andM;The slides also presented a problem, Masters said, because of the long amountof time it would require to scan in more than 60,000 slides.andM;Instead, Masters said the group converted the slides to video.andP;  One of theretrieval stations includes a Pioneer videodisk player for displaying thesides, Estes said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
