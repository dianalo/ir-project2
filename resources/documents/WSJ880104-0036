The bourse, in central Paris, occupies a neoclassic building modeled on the Vespasian Temple in Rome. Napoleon ordered its construction, and the marble frescoes on the ceiling look down on a scene that had changed little since his time.    Change did come Friday, the day fixed for the Paris bourse's big bang, though it is nowhere as revolutionary as the London market's deregulation in October 1986, which included abolition of floor trading in favor of continuous quotations via computer.    The Paris bourse ranks seventh in the world between the Toronto and Montreal exchanges. In 1986, the market value of domestic shares traded was nearly $154 billion, compared with more than $2 trillion on the New York Stock Exchange.    Even major French stocks, such as Peugeot S.A. and the recently privatized glass maker Saint-Gobain S.A., are as likely to be traded in London, rather than in Paris, by major institutional investors.    Herve de Laitre, a spokesman for the Paris Stockbrokers' Association, said in an interview that the big bang at the bourse should mean &quot;that we will be able to get Saint-Gobain back from London and have it quoted in Paris.&quot;    Mary Luxmoor, a French securities analyst with the London brokers Scrimgeour Vickers, said the bourse's problem is liquidity keeping enough buyers and sellers in the market at all times.    &quot;You can do things in London that you can't do in Paris on a bad day,&quot; she said. &quot;That is, you can sell in London, but you may not find a buyer in Paris.&quot;    As of last Friday, the monopoly on stock trading held since Napoleon's time by &quot;agents de change,&quot; as brokerage houses are known here, will begin to break down.    At first, French and foreign banks and other institutions will be able to hold as much as 30% of the capital of the agents de change. On Jan. 1, 1989, they will be able to buy a 49% stake, and by 1990, 100%.    In 1992, the monopoly will be completely eliminated and anybody will be able to start up a brokerage in Paris.    The banks now will be able to provide the capital necessary for the brokerage houses to become market makers, to take a position in the market by permanently displaying buy and sell prices, rather than handling only customer orders.    So far, 19 of the 45 stock brokerage firms with seats on the bourse have announced plans to link with banks or other financial institutions. Five of the 19 will come under the control of foreign entities, including J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., Warburg Securities, Swiss Bank Corp., Barclays de Zoete Wedd Holdings and James Capel andamp; Co.    With these changes, the Paris bourse hopes to increase market liquidity. Mr. de Laitre said, &quot;We want to be able to say to a large American fund investor who is looking to buy $15 million of Michelin, 'Yes, we have them, we can make you a market.'&quot;    The big bang won't affect another 200-year-old regulation that hampers trading. Brokerage rates are fixed by the finance ministry, so discount brokerage isn't possible, unlike London where the fixed commissions were abolished in 1986.    And unlike the big bang on the other side of the channel, this Gallic &quot;boum&quot; won't transform the market as 1988 begins. In an effort to catch up with its Anglo-Saxon rivals, the Paris bourse is gradually introducing all-day continuous trading to replace the archaic &quot;call&quot; market, which is open only two hours a day.    A visitor to the floor of the bourse looks in vain for a ticker tape giving the price at which shares have traded in the last few seconds. An exchange clerk taps with his fingers a metal plate bearing the name of a stock and, for the next few minutes, smartly dressed, chain-smoking stock brokers in the trading pits scream incomprehensibly at each other, buying and selling Peugeot shares. Once buy and sell orders have been matched, a price is &quot;fixed&quot; for the stock in question. No more trading can be done in that stock during that market session.    Then they move on to the next stock, arms waving and fingers talking in a mysterious language, in the smoky, chalkdust-laden atmosphere of the Paris bourse. Only an occasional video screen serves as a reminder of the 20th century.    More than 100 companies are quoted on the computer-assisted system, which works by matching buyers and sellers. But if a broker has 200 Peugeot shares to sell and there is no buyer, then the broker can't trade.    Barry Stamps, a Paris-based investment adviser with the firm Finexpa, said the bourse will have to work hard to compete with its cross-channel rival.    &quot;London is years ahead in experience, with its U.S. contacts and the language advantage,&quot; Mr. Stamps said in an interview, while not discounting the importance of the changes that began last Friday.    &quot;It will be a good thing for the French stock market,&quot; he said, &quot;because it is still rather archaic.&quot;    ---   World Market Activity   London share prices closed sharply lower across the board on extremely low volume Thursday, as a fresh plunge in the U.S. dollar haunted the stock market in the final session of the year.    The Financial Times 30-share index fell 34.1 points to 1373.9. That was up 4.6% from the Dec. 31, 1986, close of 1313.9 and up 11.5% from the post-October crash low of 1232.0, but down 28.7% from the July 16 high of 1926.2. Volume totaled 229.8 million shares, down from 301.3 million shares a day earlier.    The 100-share index closed off 47.1 at 1712.7, just 0.7 of a point above the session's low. The closing level was up 2% from the Dec. 31, 1986, close of 1679.0 and up 9.4% from the post-crash low close of 1565.2 on Nov. 9, but down 29.9% from the year's high close of 2443.4 on July 16.    The market Thursday fell first in response to the dollar's sharp overnight decline in currency dealings, then to further dollar weakness and a lower Wall Street opening. Dealers said worries about how the dollar's decline this week will reverberate throughout world equity markets in the new year put pressure on prices.    In particular, participants had expressed concern about the outlook for the Tokyo stock market, which reopened today after a long holiday. At the end of Monday's half-day session, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks was down 346.96, to 21217.04.    Elsewhere, stocks finished lower in Paris and Milan. Other European stock exchanges were closed.    In Paris, the dollar's steep slide on the foreign exchange market cast a shadow over the bourse, with shares retreating more than 1.5% on average to close 28.1% below their Jan. 1, 1987, levels. Traders said central banks' inability to check the dollar's fall recently was worrying, especially as it affects world trade flows. Traders in Milan, where dealings were exceptionally light in 1987's final trading day, said the market was made even more hesitant by the dollar's renewed plunge, which marred investors' hopes for 1988.    In Asia, share prices closed higher in half-day trading in both Sydney and Wellington, and were mixed in Hong Kong at the end of an abbreviated, pre-holiday session of thin trading. Markets were closed in Tokyo, Singapore, Manila and Taipei.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end. -                                                      % This                                   Dec 30    Dec 29    Year    U.S. .......................... 230.4     227.2   +  1.0    Britain ....................... 529.7     520.3   +  6.5    Canada ........................ 352.3     350.3   +  5.7    Japan ........................ 1022.3    1022.3   +  8.2    France ........................ 292.3     291.1   - 28.4    Germany ....................... 156.6     155.0   - 39.7    Hong Kong .................... 1632.7    1643.9   -  8.2    Switzerland ................... 140.6     140.0   - 30.0    Australia ..................... 254.2     255.7   -  3.7    World index ................... 405.9     402.8   + 13.8</TEXT></DOC>
