Toxic Waste Treaty-Signing Conference Opens</HEAD><BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BASEL, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Diplomats and ministers from 111nations met Monday for a U.N.-sponsored toxic waste conference toculminate in a treaty regulating international trafficking ofdangerous products.   But African delegations demanded alterations in the 51-page draftdocument and threatened to stall the three-day meeting.   If approved, the treaty formally gives all signing countries theright to refuse imports of hazardous wastes and requires exportersto provide prospective recipients details of shipments.   Signatories will pledge to dispose of dangerous waste in anenvironmentally sound way and also will commit to keep internationaltoxic waste traffic to a minimum.   Mostafa Tolba, executive director of the United NationsEnvironment Program, said international hazardous waste trade isthreatening public health and the environment.   At least 100,000 shipments of toxic waste crosses internationalborders annually in a ``commerce of poison'' worth billions ofdollars, Tolba told delegates at the opening session.   Tolba said the Basel treaty would signal the end of uncontrolledhazardous waste transport.   But Mali's environment minister, Morifing Kone, speaking for theOrganization of African Unity, said the treaty contains gaps. Hesaid some African nations want a guarantee that industrializedcountries won't use developing areas as a dumping ground forpoisonous wastes.   Greenpeace, the international environmental group, on Mondaycriticized the treaty for not covering radioactive waste andallowing member countries to sign waste trade pacts with non-membernations.   The problem of international trafficking in dangerous wastes wasdramatized last year when several waste shipments fromindustrialized countries were found dumped in African nations,including Nigeria and Guinea. Waste-laden ships traveled from portto port looking for a place to dispose of their cargo.   Environmentalists said they were concerned that importing toxicwaste had become a source of income for poor countries with no safedisposal plans.   Europe's attention was drawn to the problem earlier when barrelsof toxic waste from Italy's Seveso chemical plant spill vanished in1982 before turning up months later in France. The incident led tothe adoption of European Community rules on cross-border dangerouswaste transport.</TEXT></DOC>
