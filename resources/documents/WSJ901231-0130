In a one-count criminal information filed in federal courthere, the government alleged that in July 1985 Mr. Peeplescaused the treasurer of the East Texas First Political ActionCommittee to report a $1,000 contribution as beingvoluntarily made by an individual. In fact, the informationcharges, the money came from Sunbelt. Mr. Peeples faces amaximum penalty of five years imprisonment and a $250,000fine. Neither Mr. Peeples nor his attorney could be reachedfor comment.</LP><TEXT>   But the plea agreement filed with the court Fridaystipulates that Mr. Peeples, who has been working recently asan accountant in Dallas, won't face charges relating to hisactions at Sunbelt as long as he fulfills the terms of theagreement.   Just last week, Edwin T. McBirney III agreed to pleadguilty to bank fraud and three other federal criminal chargesstemming from his role at Sunbelt, one of the morespectacular Texas thrift collapses. Mr. McBirney'scooperation was much prized by prosecutors because of hisextensive dealings with other thrifts and their executivesduring the four years that he was chairman and chiefexecutive officer of Sunbelt Savings.   In that time, Sunbelt made 145 loans totaling $523.3million to directors, officers and shareholders of otherthrifts, according to thrift regulators, who talliedSunbelt's total losses at more than $2 billion. The thriftwas declared insolvent and merged in August 1988 with sevenother Texas thrifts into a new entity, Sunbelt Savings FSB.   In a separate Texas thrift case, a federal court jury inDallas on Friday acquitted Bob R. Franks, a former directorof the defunct Metroplex Federal Savings Association, and hisonetime lawyer, Earl Rutledge of Hurst.   The two men had been indicted in May on charges related tothe misuse of loan proceeds from Metroplex and charges thatthey attempted to hamper the grand jury investigation of theloan.</TEXT></DOC>
