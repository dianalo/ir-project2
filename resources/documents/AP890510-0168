The Beijing Daily talksnonsense!'' students chanted in their first march-on-wheels innearly a month of campaigning for political reforms. Many of the5,000 students wore colorful paper sashes and headbands supportingtheir cause.   Students in the provincial capital of Taiyuan joined in thedemocracy movement for the first time Wednesday when thousands heldsit-ins in front of a hotel and Shanxi provincial governmentoffices.   The official Xinhua News Agency described the Taiyuandemonstration as ``massive'' but gave no exact figure forparticipants. A reporter at the Shanxi Daily, contacted bytelephone, said 4,000 to 5,000 students took part and demanded adialogue on corruption with the governor.   The reporter said the protest was peaceful. It was not clear ifthe governor responded.   Thousands of students in more than a dozen other cities alsohave held sporadic protests for political reform since Beijingstudents began the movement April 15.   But Beijing students have protested in the greatest numbers topress their demands for a dialogue with national leaders to reformChina's tightly controlled political system.   On Wednesday, the Ministry of Supervision said it will allowmore open news reporting of corruption cases. It said the move was``prompted by the recent demands of Beijing University students tocrack down on corruption'' _ the first acknowlegement that thegovernment was giving ground to students and workers.   The bicycle protest was much smaller than other recent protestsin the capital, but participants said they were keeping up pressureon the government. At least 16 schools took part.   Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who has madeseveral conciliatory statements on the student movement, onWednesday stressed the need for political reform but mentioned nospecific changes.   Zhao was a key sponsor of political reform plans in 1987 thatcalled for increasing popular access to officials and reducingdirect party involvement in day-to-day government operations. Butpolitical reforms have been put on hold in the past year as leadershave emphasized re-establishing controls over a chaotic economy.   ``Many difficulties that have cropped up in the course of thereform of the economic setup cannot possibly be overcome without areform of the political setup,'' Xinhua quoted Zhao as telling avisiting Bulgarian delegation.   The student protesters have put forward no comprehensivepolitical program, but say they want the rights listed in theChinese constitution _ freedom of speech, assembly and publication.   Strict party censorship of the media has been a target of theirprotests.   The student bicyclists painted slogans on their T-shirts,jackets, hats and headbands calling for a free press and accuratereporting on their own protests. They also expressed support formore than 1,000 journalists who signed a petition given to thegovernment Tuesday calling for a dialogue on censorship.   The bicyclists stopped traffic for miles as they swarmed fromcampuses in northern Beijing to hold protests at the national TVnetwork, Xinhua and the People's Daily, the party newspaper. Noofficials came out to speak with them.   ``People's reporters, speak for the people,'' the studentschanted outside the People's Daily, where they were cheered byabout 2,000 residents. One man brought out two cases of beer forthe thirsty protesters.   About 50 leading writers cycled along with the students, thefirst time they have done so. About 300 journalists joined astudent march last week.   ``They should not be allowed to stand alone,'' said writer SuXiaokang.   Police did not attempt to interfere, and tried along severalstretches of the route to clear the way for the bicyclists.   Many students said they planned more protests next week whenSoviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrives for the firstChinese-Soviet summit in 30 years.   ``I am willing to keep marching,'' said one student. ``I'm a bittired but these things cannot be achieved in just one swoop.''</TEXT></DOC>
