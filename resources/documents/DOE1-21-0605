<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-21-0605 </DOCNO><TEXT>The tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome (TRPS) is a rare congenital disorder,characterized by (1) a peculiar and somewhat pear-shaped nose, (2) sparseand brittle scalp hair, and (3) radiographic evidence of coneshaped epiphysesof the hands. On the basis of clinical, radiographic and genetic criteria,two subtypes (type I and II) are discerned. We describe an intermediate'hybrid' variant of the TRPS in a patient with clinical and radiographicfeatures of TRPS type I, but with a clearly abnormal karyotype, consistentwith TRPS type II. The radiographic findings of the syndrome are reviewed,with particular emphasis on the cone-shaped epiphyses in the hands, thechanges in the coxo-femoral joints and the atypical appearance of thepubic symphysis.</TEXT></DOC>
