Col.Frank Fuessl says softly as he surveys the familiar MiG-21cockpit. The Soviet-built fighter, parked in a camouflagedmaintenance bay, is one of 40 modernized MiG-21s attached tothe Hermann Matern Fighter Squadron.   The veteran pilot, who can rattle off 100 flight commandsin Russian, recalls the countless Warsaw Pact briefings, thecoastal patrols, the dogfights with mock North AtlanticTreaty Organization forces. Col. Fuessl leans inside thefighter, flicks on the gun sights and manipulates thethrottle. He never wanted a war, he says, but he would havedone his duty.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;She really is a peppy plane,&quot; he says, adding with avague nod westward, &quot;She could have held her own againstanything over there.&quot;   Now, he will never know. When Germany is officiallyunified Oct. 3, his squadron will be wiped out without asingle shot being fired. The German unification treaty callsfor the absorption of East Germany's armed forces by itsformer enemy, the West German Bundeswehr, America's biggestNATO ally.   The annexation poses logistical problems that will sendBonn's already stratospheric unification bill soaring evenhigher. &quot;Very roughly,&quot; says Bernd Wilz, defense-policyspeaker for West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ChristianDemocratic Union, &quot;it could come to 10 billion marks ($6.43billion) in 1991&quot; alone.   Merger also carries a high human cost, and will turn theworld of men like Col. Fuessl upside down. &quot;Now, I'm a42-year-old fighter pilot with a family,&quot; he says, &quot;and myprospects are absolutely zero.&quot;   Overnight, West German officers will assume control ofEast German units and begin to sort through East German armsand personnel to determine what can be saved. Most of EastGermany's 445 combat aircraft -- useless for a West GermanLuftwaffe that is part of NATO -- will be either scrapped orsold. East Germany also has 2,220 tanks, 2,200heavy-artillery pieces and several thousand trucks, the WestGermans estimate.   For four decades, East Germany's National People's Armywas one of Moscow's staunchest Warsaw Pact allies, with aprominent role to play in any European war. The officers wereall Communist Party members, sworn to defend East Germany andcommunism in close alliance with the Soviet Union.   Last year, East Germany's army had 178,000 men under arms;today, a few more than 90,000 remain. Rainer Eppelmann, thepacifist pastor serving as East Germany's post-revolutiondefense minister, cut back on conscripts and thinned out theofficer corps. Many officers resigned, and many enlisted menwere discharged to join East Germany's growing unemploymentlines.   Of the East German troops that remain, only 50,000 areexpected to stay on active duty in the united force once atwo-year screening and integration process is completed. The5,000 commissars who led political classes and kept theirears open for incautious criticism of socialist achievementshave already been dropped. Nobody over the age of 50 will beaccepted, which excludes most of East Germany's 35 remaininggenerals and admirals; of the handful that might make thecut, none are expected to be given command of a majormilitary unit.   Those kept on will receive Bundeswehr uniforms andinsignia on Oct. 3, when West German Defense Minister GerhardStoltenberg will issue his first orders to former East Germantroops. Mr. Stoltenberg has appointed West German Lt. Gen.Joerg Schoenbohm to head a staff of 80 West German officersforming the nucleus of Bonn's new district militaryheadquarters in East Germany. The staff will oversee about1,000 West German officers from all three services, who will&quot;advise&quot; or assume command of former East German units.   Any East German officers retained will probably have toaccept a reduction in rank, and for some time continue tolive with East German pay -- about one-third of comparableWest German levels. But the pay of East German conscriptswill be raised to West German levels.   &quot;Psychologically, it's an unusual and very complicatedsituation,&quot; says Col. Uwe Hempel, a spokesman for the EastGerman Defense Ministry, which will cease to actindependently next month.   Bonn officials coordinating the takeover acknowledge thatthe adjustment will be difficult, particularly for careerofficers. &quot;Our intention is to be as humane, sociallyequitable and psychologically sensitive as possible,&quot; saysthe CDU's Mr. Wilz. After listening to the concerns of EastGerman soldiers on such matters as pay and job security, headds, &quot;we can't let our people simply go in and start givingorders without considering the people there.&quot;   There has been some friction already. East German officerswere enraged by a report in Der Spiegel magazine that theywould initially be issued only fatigues because West Germanofficers refused to allow them to wear the Bundeswehr dressuniform. Bonn insists that stocks of dress uniforms were toolow for immediate distribution, but the East Germans simmerwith wounded pride.   As the two armies get a closer look at each other, someEast German personnel also have bristled at the impression ofbeing treated like a defeated army. &quot;We know that manyBundeswehr officers categorically refuse to work with formerEast German officers,&quot; says Lt. Col. Hermann Schade,executive officer of the Hermann Matern squadron. &quot;There's noreason why I can't continue to do staff work in theBundeswehr. But I've done this job for 18 years, and now it'swasted. All we expect is to go out with our dignity.&quot;   The two German armies even have some trouble communicatingin their own language. &quot;For me, it's natural to speak Russianwith someone on the telephone,&quot; says Col. Hempel. &quot;But whenwe talk with Bundeswehr officers in German, we noticed howmany English terms they used. Sometimes, we just couldn'tfollow.&quot;   The fighter squadron at the sprawling Marxwalde base haslittle chance of survival. And prospects that theinstallation itself would be retained as a NATO air base aredim. The bunkers and maintenance bays are too small for NATOfighters, which are also probably too heavy for the taxiways.   The Hermann Matern squadron has already lost 400 enlistedmen from its former ground staff of 900. Most ties with theSoviet command were severed months ago, and the Soviets haveremoved secret communications gear from East German bases.   Meanwhile, the airmen at Marxwalde are hedging their betsabout staying in NATO uniforms. Some of the younger pilotsmay get the chance to become part of the Bundeswehr'sLuftwaffe and be retrained on NATO fighters, such as the F-4Phantom or the Tornado.   But many of the pilots, fearing discharge, have alreadyapplied to Lufthansa or other airlines for civilian jobs.Many mechanics have applied for jobs at West German aerospacefirms. Some even want to try their luck in the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
