 Technologically the nextstep from full-text data bases is image management systems.andP;  Imagemanagement systems consist of a CPU, scanner, high-resolutionmonitor and printer with CD-ROM technology.andP;  Basis-Images fromInformation Dimensions of Dublin, OH is an image management systemthat allows users to scan, digitize, display and process imagessuch as photos and graphic arts.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Imaging TechnologyText Data BasesImage ProcessingData Base Management SystemsTechnology.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Going Beyond Text to Images Is Next StepandM;Buyers no longer need to be content with text-only retrieval systems.andP;  Datamanagement and retrieval systems that can handle compounddocuments--combinations of text, charts, graphics and even photographs--arebecoming more widely available.andM;Dataquest estimates there are at least 25 products on the market that &quot;dealwith a piece of paper as an image,&quot; said Pamela Bliss, an industry analystfor the San Jose, Calif., market research company.andM;&quot;Image management systems are the next step&quot; up from full-text retrievalsystems, Bliss said.andP;  Many agree.andM;Typically, these systems combine a CPU, scanner, high-resolution monitor andprinter with CD-ROM technology to store, catalog and retrieve compounddocuments.andM;Prices for such systems start at about $130,000 to $150,000--the top end offull-text systems--and range up to the millions.andP;  That helps explain why onevendor, Wang Laboratories of Lowell, Mass., has been advertising its systemon network television.andM;Current top image management system vendors include IBM; Kodak of Rochester,N.Y.; Laserdata of Lowell, Mass.; Plexus of San Jose, Calif.; and FileNet ofCosta Mesa, Calif.andM;Image management adherents point to the obvious advantages of combining textand image searches in one system.andP;  The technology could be useful, forexample, in calling up photographs in a personnel system search, X-rayrecords with a medical history, or photos of an auto accident with aninsurance claim, they say.andM;&quot;This is going to crowd out text retrieval,&quot; Bliss said.andP;  &quot;Text retrievaljust doesn't work for companies, like insurance companies, that have to dealwith forms.&quot;andM;Already, several vendors have added or plan to add at least some imagemanagement capabilities to their products.andP;  Others are watching the imagemanagement market closely.andM;Last month officials at Information Dimensions of Dublin, Ohio, announcedthat the company's Basis/Images image management system now lets users scan,digitize, display and process images such as photos and graphic arts images.andM;Scanned images of monochrome printed document pages are stored on CD-ROM,write-once-read-many and Winchester drives attached to PC-DOS workstations.andO;Images of 100 to 300 dots per inch can be scanned with a desktop orproduction scanner.andM;The capability requires that users have GTerm software (first license $300)and a UFF conversion utility (license $500), as well as Basis software, imagecaputure and display boards, a u9-inch monitor, and a scanner.andM;Officials at one leading full-text DBMS vendor, CompuServe Data Technologiesof Cambridge, Mass., are among those who believe that image management has afuture, but they said the company intends to proceed cautiously.andM;CompuServe is implementing basic language object (BLOB) technology to upgradeits System 1032 4GL/DBMS, which Charles Terry, company general manager,termed a &quot;compromise between relational database and full-text.&quot;andP;  (See&quot;Graphics Databases Arrive,&quot; Digital Review, July 25, page 64.)andM;BLOB allows for unlimited degitized storage of any type of data--whether inthe form of images, voice or even music--with the aid of CD-ROM.andP;  This opensthe door to several applications.andM;For example, CompuServe officials said the University of Washington isworking on a NASA project, storing photographic data.andP;  Others besidesCompuServe officials also believe that image management technology has anatural role in full-text DBMS products.andM;&quot;I don't think you're going to find full-text without image capabilities,&quot;said William Boehlke, president of Laticorp, a full-text DBMS vendor based inSan Francisco.andP;  &quot;The front-end tools are going to merge.&quot;andM;He added that Laticorp expects to have image capability within the next yearand possibly sooner.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
