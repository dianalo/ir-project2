This applies in particular to effluents produced in millsreflecting the latest Central European standard closed whitewater circuit.This development is expected to continue. The economic benefits of anaerobicwaste water treatment are striking enough to encourage preferential useof this method. The paper presents the anaerobic process engineeringtechnique. The present stage of advancement and recognizable future trendsare discussed. In the light of field experience gained, conclusions aredrawn as to suitable processes to be chosen. Existing problems are consideredsolvable by appropriate process selection and effective process control.</TEXT></DOC>
