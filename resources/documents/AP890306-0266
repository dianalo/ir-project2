The justices unanimously upheld the authority of Kansas officialsto control production from what is believed to be the largestnatural gas reservoir in the world.   The decision upheld regulations adopted by the Kansas CorporationCommission.   At issue was gas from the Hugoton Field, which extends acrossportions of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. About two-thirds of thefield is in Kansas, containing some 4,000 wells as of 1983. Most ofthe gas is carried outside the state through pipelines.   The Kansas Corporation Commission since 1944 imposed regulationsaimed at assuring that each well will ultimately produce about theamount of gas underlying the land held by each leaseholder.   The idea was to treat well owners equally, since gas can migrateunderground from an unproducing area to a well that is overproducing.   To assure equal treatment, the state fixed the maximum amount ofgas that can be produced each month from each well.   In practice, wells cannot always be operated to meet monthlyceilings for varying reasons. For example, there may be a low demandin a given month.   To allow for these variables, state officials permitted owners ofunderproducing wells to ``save up'' their production ceilings _creating what are called ``underages'' _ and overproduce in futuremonths to make up for the shortfalls.   To create a production incentive, the Kansas commission changedthe rules in 1983 by declaring that underages must be used withinspecified periods of years or they would be cancelled.   The use-it-or-lose-it policy was challenged by Northwest CentralPipeline Corp., one of the major buyers of the Hugoton gas fortransport outside Kansas.   Northwest Central said the 1983 rule change prevents it frompurchasing gas reserves that it is entitled to contractually.   The pipeline company asked the Supreme Court to strike down the1983 regulations on grounds that the Federal Energency RegulatoryCommission has exclusive authority over natural gas production.   Northwest Central also argued that the regulations impermissiblyinterfered with interstate commerce.   Writing for the court today, Justice William J. Brennan said theKansas regulations are neither pre-empted by federal law norunconstitutional.   ``We must decide whether a regulation ... to govern the timing ofproduction of natural gas from the Kansas-Hugoton field violateseither (the constitutional clause giving federal law supremacy overconflicting state laws) or the commerce clause,'' Brennan said. ``Wehold that it does not.''   The justices ruled in 1986 that states may not require interstatepipelines to buy gas from all owners of a common gas pool when thepipeline had pre-existing contracts with only some of the owners.   But Reagan administration lawyers had told the high court thatthe Kansas controversy should not be controlled by the 1986 ruling.   The case is Northwest Central Pipeline Corp. vs. StateCorporation Commission of Kansas, 86-1856.</TEXT></DOC>
