The contract for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate, thebenchmark grade of U.S. crude, recovered nearly half of the amountlost in Tuesday's selloff.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May WTI contract endedthe session at $20.20 a barrel, up 29 cents from Tuesday'ssettlement. On Tuesday, the May crude oil contract shed 62 centsfrom Monday's closing level.   Prices were bid up in the energy pits Monday as traders weighedthe implications of an oil spill off the Alaskan port of Valdez,which caused the temporary closure of the port, reducing U.S. crudesupplies for a time.   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,unleaded gasoline for April delivery rose 1.50 cents, settling at60.18 cents a gallon. The April heating oil contract finished off0.42 cent, at 54.62 cents a gallon, but contracts for May, June andJuly delivery all posted gains.   John H. O'Connell, a senior energy analyst at Refco Inc., saidenergy futures weakened in the early going Wednesday and thengained fresh upward momentum, mainly because of buying in thegasoline pits.   ``Everybody's in love with gasoline,'' said O'Connell.   Traders have been buying gasoline in recent weeks amidspeculation that supplies could be tight this summer in theNortheast if refiners in the region are required to alter theirmethods. Gasoline refining changes which would cutpollution-causing emissions have been proposed in a plan aimed atreducing smog in the Northeastern states.   O'Connell said some of the gasoline buying Wednesday may havebeen caused by a change in the New York Mercantile Exchange'scontract specifications. The exchange made the change to complywith recently altered industry practices.   Meanwhile, crude oil buying may have been spurred by indicationsthat the OPEC countries are in no hurry to establish higher crudeproduction levels.   An OPEC monitoring committee met Wednesday in Vienna, Austria toformally review the cartel's price-boosting strategy.   Subroto, secretary-general of the 13-nation Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, said the eight panel membersdiscussed a range of topics in the four-hour, closed-door meetingbut he refused to elaborate.   ``The function of the committee is to review prices and toreview (production) quotas,'' he said. ``...We are not going tomake any decision.''</TEXT></DOC>
