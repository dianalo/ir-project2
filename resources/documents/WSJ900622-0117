Many packaged-goods advertisers are breaking conventionalmarketing wisdom by running ads stuffed with pitches for two,three, some times more than four separate products.</LP><TEXT>   A new commercial from Colgate-Palmolive starts with atired little kid marching up to the sink for a morning brushwith Colgate Junior toothpaste. Then the ad shifts to anolder kid stuffing a tube of regular Colgate into a backpack.Cut to a shot of construction workers jackhammering thestreet -- and a pitch for Colgate anti-cavity mouth rinse.Then on to Colgate tartar control toothpaste and two types ofColgate toothbrushes. All in 60 seconds.   Colgate is hardly alone in its approach.   Ralston Purina is working on a commercial that willsimultaneously pitch its Dog Chow, Puppy Chow, Hi-Pro and Fitandamp; Trim dog foods. Johnson andamp; Johnson recently began a campaignfor its line of Tylenol products, including CoTylenol coldmedicine, Tylenol allergy medicine and children's Tylenol.Guinness's U.S. importer just began running an ad that plugsits Guinness Stout and Guinness Gold beers.   Such &quot;line campaigns&quot; may stem in part from tighter adbudgets, but advertisers who use them say they alsocapitalize on the growing belief that the name of the companyitself -- not just its brand names -- is a powerful sellingpoint.   Some advertising specialists, though, say that isn'tnecessarily the case. Stuffed ads can backfire, these expertssay, because the individual brands' identities suffer, whilethe more general corporate pitch may not pack as powerful apunch with brand-conscious consumers.   &quot;This very well could be self-defeating,&quot; says CharlieMoss, vice chairman at ad agency Wells, Rich, Greene in NewYork. &quot;I'm sure there are brands where this clearly wouldn'twork. There are times when consumers would be confused by ageneral commercial that lumps together brands with veryconflicting images.&quot;   Marketing gurus say past ad campaigns that have tried tolink disparate brands under a corporate umbrella have faredpoorly. A few years back, a campaign for Beatrice Cos.linking varied brands from Stiffel lamps to Martha Whitegrits was met with widespread derision.   Today, often mentioned as a disastrously confusing spot isone by Van Munching andamp; Co. that has two pitchmen on a splitscreen simultaneously talking up its Heineken and AmstelLight beers. Not only is the ad hard to follow, skeptics say,but also the two brands have very different targets thatcan't be courted effectively in the same ad. Not so, says BobFiore, at Van Munching's ad agency Warwick Baker andamp; Fiore.&quot;The audience is very, very similar.&quot; He adds, though, thatcost was one strong factor in deciding on the double pitch.   Similarly, skeptics already question Ralston's plannedeffort to promote four very different dog food brands in onead. Marketing specialists say the company is threatening towalk away from all the time and money it has investeddeveloping unique personalities for each of its dog foodbrands.   &quot;The brands are so strong on their own, I really have ahard time understanding that one,&quot; says Jack Vogler, seniorvice president at Landor andamp; Associates, San Francisco-basedidentity specialists. &quot;It really doesn't sound like it'sgoing to do any one brand a whole helluva lot of good. Thisis a really competitive marketplace.&quot;   Ralston declines to comment on its new campaign. But theads are expected to focus on a general pitch for Ralstonbrand dog food, while also briefly describing each of thefour brands.   Some advertisers say the real power in a line campaign isits ability to help bolster a company's corporate image whilereminding consumers of the products it makes. &quot;We think thisis an interesting and involving way to tell Americanconsumers who may not be aware that Colgate has in fact thismultiplicity of products,&quot; says Ed Fogarty, president ofColgate U.S. The new Colgate campaign replaces its &quot;WisdomTooth&quot; ads, which featured actor Pat Morita of the &quot;KarateKid&quot; movies.   Colgate and Johnson andamp; Johnson, though, aren't putting alltheir money on the line campaigns. Both say they plan tocontinue supporting individual brands with separate ads.   A spokesman for Johnson andamp; Johnson's McNeil ConsumerProducts unit calls the Tylenol campaign &quot;supplementallayover&quot; in addition to the usual brand advertising. &quot;We seethis as just a different approach to the everyday competitiveadvertising,&quot; he says. The Tylenol effort, the first-everline campaign for the brand, began in April.   Ralston says it isn't yet clear what ads, if any, it willcontinue to run on its individual brands once the linecampaign starts. Ralston is expected to spend about $25million on the line campaign.   Colgate says it's finishing new ads for individual brandsthat will be crafted in the same visual style as the linecampaign. The ads will feature the same theme song as theline ads, but they will more prominently featurebrand-specific information, Mr. Fogarty says.   &quot;Our basic belief is that the umbrella commercial alonewouldn't be enough,&quot; he says. &quot;We did some preliminarytesting just before going on the air that was encouraging,but the jury is out relative to whether the thing will work,&quot;he says.   ---   Hill Holliday Gets Lotus                                                                                                          Lotus Development pulled its $10 million to $12 million adaccount from Scali, McCabe, Sloves and awarded it to Boston'sHill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos.   Scali McCabe had won the software company's account justlast November after a review that also included HillHolliday. But Lotus said it moved the account because itwanted an agency closer to its Cambridge, Mass.,headquarters.   In an unusual move, Lotus said two of its marketingexecutives will take offices at Hill Holliday to work moreclosely with the agency executives working on its account.   &quot;We think they {Scali} have been doing a nice job,&quot; saidKelsey Selander, Lotus vice president of marketingcommunications. &quot;But we wanted to totally marry our internalcreative program with our agency. We wanted to work with anagency at home.&quot;   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
