Alley, Jr. (703) 557-1145.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On May 20, 1988, the Committee forPurchase from the Blind and Other Severely Handicapped published a notice(53 FR 18117) of proposed addition to Procurement List 1988, December 10,1987 (52 FR 46926).Comments were received from a law firm representing the International Associationof Wiping Cloth Manufacturers (IAWCM) regarding the proposed addition ofthe Warner Robins, Georgia requirements for this wiping rag.The major issues raised in the comments concerned the impact on the wipingrag industry, the Federal Government, and the environment if the Government'srequirements for all wiping rags are added to the Procurement List. Inaddition, the commenter questioned the workshop's capability to meet surgedemands by the Government and suggested the Committee should not use itsprocedures for determining the fair market price for the rags since theworkshop has a free source for the raw materials.<ITAG tagnum="84">Impact on Industry, Federal Government, and Environment</ITAG>The commenter discussed the impact on the industry, Federal Governmentand the environment if the total requirements of the Federal Governmentfor wiping cloths were to be added to the Procurement List. He indicatedthat the IAWCM members are gravely concerned that this action is only thefirst step in an attempt by the workshops to become the dominant or solesupplier of wiping rags to the Government.The issue considered by the Committee is the addition of only the WarnerRobins, Georgia requirements for the wiping rag, NSN 7920-00-205-1711 tothe Procurement List. The statements made by the commenter regarding theeffect on the wiping cloth industry, the Federal Government, and the environmentif all of the Government's requirements for wiping rags were added to theProcurement List is not germane and is, therefore, inappropriate to beaddressed by the Committee relative to this action.The value of the current contractor's contract for the portion consideredby the Committee in this action represents about 1.8% of the annual salesof that firm. This is not considered to be serious impact.The Committee in its regulations (41 CFR 51-2.6 ``Suitability'') statesthat in deciding whether or not a proposed addition to the ProcurementList would have a serious adverse impact on the current or most recentcontractor, the Committee gives particular attention to the possible impacton that contractor's sales, including any cumulative impact as a resultof other recent Committee actions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Capability of Workshop to Produce</ITAG>The commenter indicated that wiping cloths are considered by the Governmentto be ``mission essential'' and producers must be able to meet surge demandson an expedited basis. He questioned the workshop's capability to findappropriate personnel quickly due to the various operations involved inprocessing them for sale to the Government.This addition will create three jobs for severely handicapped persons.If the Government's requirements were doubled, only three additional personswould be required. The Committee does not feel that the workshop will havedifficulty in obtaining and training additional personnel to produce thesewiping rags to meet the surge requirements of the Government. The procuringactivity has indicated as a result of an on-site inspection that the workshopis capable of producing the wiping rags in compliance with commercial itemdescription. In addition, personnel from the National Industries for theSeverely Handicapped have inspected the workshop and verified that theworkshop is capable of producing the wiping rags. Based on the above, theCommittee has determined that the workshop is capable of producing thewiping rags in compliance with the Government's requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Market Price</ITAG>The commenter stated that the Committee's fair market price procedure shouldnot be used for these wiping rags since the workshop has a free sourcefor raw materials.Under the Committee's Act, the Committee is responsible for determining``fair market prices'' for commodities and services on the ProcurementList (41 U.S.C. 47(b)). The Committee considers that the reasonable bidsreceived by the Government for the item under consideration are the bestmeasure of the market for that item. Under its longstanding policy, theinitial fair market prices for items being added to the Procurement List,which have been recently procured by the Government, are based on the medianof the reasonable bids which were received on the most recent procurement,or the award price increased by 5%, whichever is greater. Thus, the workshop'scost for the raw materials used in producing the wiping rags for the Governmentis not an appropriate issue in the Committee determination of the fairmarket price for those rags.Based on the preceding, the price established by the Committee is consideredto be reflective of the market for the wiping rags and is a fair marketprice within the policies and procedures of the Committee.After consideration of the relevant matter presented, the Committee hasdetermined that the commodity listed below is suitable for procurementby the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.6.I certify that the following action will not have a significant impacton a substantial number of small entities. The major factors consideredwere:a. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeepingor other compliance requirements.b. The action will not have a serious economic impact on any contractorsfor the commodity listed.c. The action will result in authorizing small entities to produce thecommodity procured by the Government.Accordingly, the following commodity is hereby added to Procurement List1988:<ITAG tagnum="74">Rag, Wiping</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7920-00-205-1711</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">(Requirements for Warner Robins, Georgia only)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">E.R.
