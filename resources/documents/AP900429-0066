PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lithuania's official radio said Sunday that theSoviet Union was easing its economic blockade against the Balticrepublic by nearly doubling the supply of natural gas. Lithuania'spresident said it was only a promise.   The radio report said the natural gas was bound for a factorythat supplies Moscow with chemicals and fertilizers.   ``Nothing has been connected,'' Lithuanian President VytautasLandsbergis told NBC News Sunday afternoon. It was promised thatthe gas supply was being increased, he said, ``but that has nothappened.''   A Lithuanian government spokesman also said that as of lateSunday, increased gas supplies had not yet arrived.   Residents of the Baltic republic, which declared independenceMarch 11, organized a bicycle rally Sunday to show their defianceof the blockade.   An estimated 20,000 more gathered in Cathedral Square in thecapital, Vilnius, to hear the republic's orchestra performBeethoven's Ninth Symphony. Landsbergis, a music professor, hassaid that for him, the symphony symbolizes hope and humanity's``victory over slavery.''   Word of the sudden easing of the gas restriction came after bothLithuania and a spokesman for President Mikhail S. Gorbachevpraised a proposed compromise to their dispute offered by Franceand West Germany. The two Western countries proposed Lithuaniadelay implementing its independence without rescinding thedeclaration itself.   The Soviet Union has cut off all oil supplies, and shipments ofmany manufactured goods, raw materials and food items in an effortto make Lithuania back away from the declaration of independence.   Vilnius Radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. inLondon, said the industrial plant at Jonova, whose natural gassupplies had been drastically cut, was being resupplied. The plantsupplies the Soviet Union with concentrated ammonium, resins,methanol and other products.   If the amount promised the plant were delivered, it would nearlydouble the total natural gas flowing into the republic.   But Paul Pauparas, manager of the Supreme Council legislature'sinformation department, said in a telephone interview that no extrasupplies of gas had been received as of Sunday evening.   Operators at the plant ``have no exact information whether itwill be really renewed or it is only promises,'' he said.   He said details of the agreement to increase the flow of gaslikely were provided directly to the plant director by Moscow, butthat government officials in Vilnius had not been able to confirmspecifics.   Earlier, Rita Radzavicius, a spokeswoman for the informationdepartment, had confirmed that the Jonova plant had started toreceive its allotment of gas.   The radio said the Jonova plant was to receive about 105 millioncubic feet of natural gas each day _ ``almost sufficient for theplant to keep operating normally,'' it said.   Radio Vilnius said from the beginning of the blockade, all ofLithuania had been receiving about 123 million cubic feet ofnatural gas per day _ ``just enough for everyday household needs.''Before the blockade began, the republic received about 635 millioncubic feet of natural gas a day.   Pauparas said the Jonova plant had been receiving only about24.7 million cubic feet of gas a day, and that most of its majorproduction facilities already had been shut down.   That meant a loss to the Soviet Union of chemicals andfertilizers normally supplied by the plant, he said, adding thatLithuania uses a relatively small proportion of the products madethere.   If the plant resumes full production, it will continuefulfilling its previous contracts, Pauparas said.   The radio said about 30 percent of the plant's work force, ormore than 1,000 people, would be going back to work on Monday. Theyhad been forced out of work because of shortage of gas.   There was no official announcement by Moscow of a change ofpolicy, but in an interview with the Tass news agency Saturday, thedeputy chairman of the Soviet State Supply Committee VladimirKosyunin said Lithuania was receiving 30 percent of its normalshare of natural gas. When the restriction went into effect morethan a week ago, it was receiving only about 16 percent.   Gorbachev demanded two weeks ago that Lithuania rescind new lawsthat exempted Lithuanians from the Soviet military draft, gaveownership of Communist Party buildings to Lithuania's independentCommunists, and established new rules on citizenship that Russiansliving in Lithuania considered discriminatory.   When the demands were not met, the Kremlin imposed the economicblockade. Earlier, Moscow seized buildings, conducted militarymaneuvers and barred most foreigners from the republic of 3.8million people.</TEXT></DOC>
