Shareholder-tenants of a cooperative building we'll call the Up-in Arms find it hard to sell the apartments because buyers can't get financing for co-op ownership. So the holders want to change to condominiums, for which mortgages are easier to get. The co-op corporation would liquidate and exchange direct title to a unit for a holder's stock; no other changes in the status quo would occur. The co-op's holders asked the IRS for approval.    Now, IRS private ruling 8812049 slams the door on such conversions, says Robert Willens of Shearson Lehman Hutton. The 1986 tax act requires liquidating corporations to pay tax on gains in the value of assets they distribute -- and it provides no exception for the Up-in Arms, the ruling asserts. The IRS does concede that this result &quot;can be harsh&quot; for a mere change in ownership form.    &quot;Such taxation will make co-op to condo conversions economically infeasible in many cases,&quot; it says.    THE STATES' TAX TAKE rose 8.3% last year, the Census Bureau reports.    Collections climbed to $247.15 billion in fiscal 1987, with general sales taxes up 7% to $80 billion and personal income taxes up 13% to $76 billion. Rhode Island's 18.6% rise to $1.05 billion was the steepest increase, but 16 other states showed at least 10%. California, which amasses the most revenue, boosted its take 15.2% to $35.79 billion. State taxes per capita averaged $1,018 nationally. The bite ranged from $2,024 in Alaska and $1,567 in Hawaii down to $587 in South Dakota and $532 in New Hampshire.    Tax revenue dropped for seven states -- Alaska, Wyoming, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Louisiana, Montana, and West Virginia. Most of them depend heavily on their oil and gas industries for revenue. Alaska, down 43.2% to $1.06 billion, and Wyoming, down 20.6% to $631.7 million, were hit the hardest. Texas showed a gain of just under 1% to $11.2 billion.    A BIRD IN THE HAND gets harder to value for executives who defer pay.    A popular benefit lets them defer pay or bonus-and tax -- and get it with interest later. All of it can be invested that way, not just a post-tax sum. But talk that the 28% top tax rate is bound to rise has complicated the choice. With an 8% annual return and a 28% tax rate (and other assumptions), a five-year deferral to 1993 offers a 13% gain over investing after-tax dollars, says C. David Anderson of Tuttle andamp; Taylor, Los Angeles lawyers. Yet the gain is only 5% if the tax rate is 33% by 1993.    Still, Anderson cautions, executives shouldn't overreact to tax-boost fears: Long deferral periods, higher return rates, and other factors easily can offset much of the effect of a future tax increase. For example, a 20-year deferral and an 8% return can produce a 36% advantage over investing after-tax dollars, even with a 40% tax rate, he calculates. With a 10% return, the benefit jumps to 49%.    The moral, says Anderson: Do the numbers before deciding whether to defer compensation.    OH, BY THE WAY, the General Accounting Office, Congress's audit arm, says IRS computers were in good shape to process 1987 returns. Software was ready by Feb. 1, mainframe computers had sufficient capacity, and old communications processors, which are overdue for replacement, still were adequate.    CHILDREN AGE TWO and up would have to have Social Security numbers to be listed on returns as dependents, a Senate Finance Committee bill proposes. Currently, returns must show the Social Security numbers of dependents who are five or older.    ENROLLED AGENTS aren't lawyers or CPAs but have qualified to represent taxpayers before the IRS. Some say the title confuses the public and suggests that the practitioners represent the government. Thus the IRS is seeking proposals to revise the title.    TAX THE UNTAXABLE? The Treasury averts a minimum-tax scare for charities.    The 1986 tax act revised the 20% alternative minimum tax on corporations to cover part of book income, the profit shown in financial statements that usually exceeds taxable income. This tax also applies to taxable income that charities and other exempt entities earn from subsidiary businesses unrelated to their exempt functions. And to some, the new law makes it appear that if such an entity has taxable income, its exempt income is treated as book income subject to the minimum tax.    In effect, the law seems to tax all exempt income at 20% if an entity has $1 of unrelated-business tax, says Frank N. Vito of Pannell Kerr Forster, CPAs. The question that raises is urgent, for exempt entities' 1987 returns are due May 15. But government sources agree that Congress didn't mean the tax to apply to such exempt income. Now a Treasury official provides this reassurance:   &quot;Final regulations will clarify that book income related to an organization's exempt activities isn't included in its book income for purposes of figuring the minimum tax.&quot;    BRIEFS: The U.S. Tax Court plans an international conference May 16 to 18 in Washington to discuss administrative issues with judges handling tax cases in at least nine other nations. . . . The IRS plans a hearing June 15 on proposed rules defining a resident alien and one June 28 on proposed rules for passive-loss deductions. </TEXT></DOC>
