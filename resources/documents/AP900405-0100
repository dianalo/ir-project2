He was 74.   Goodridge, a tree surgeon and professional scuba diver, dead ata Rockport hospital Wednesday. The cause of death was not given.   Over the years, Andre's antics delighted fans who followed hisannual spring swim from his winter home in southern New England toRockport Harbor.   Goodridge found Andre in 1961 as a 2-day-old pup apparentlyabandoned by its mother.   During the summers, Andre was kept in a floating pen andentertained thousands of summer visitors by performing a repertoryof tricks with Goodridge.   But when Andre was allowed to run free in the winter, his habitof clambering aboard anchored dinghies and sinking them annoyedfishermen, prompting Goodridge to ship his pal to aquariums inBoston or Mystic, Conn., for the winter.   With the end of winter, the seal was released for a swim back upthe coast to Rockport that became an annual event.   Andre died in 1986 after he was spotted with bruises apparentlysuffered in a fight with another male seal. The 5-foot, 250-poundseal was buried in a pasture behind Goodridge's home.   ``Many seals may live longer but few live as full a life asAndre,'' Goodridge said at the time.   Goodridge is survived by his wife, Thalice, a son and fourdaughters.   A funeral service will be held Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
