Christopher, general manager of theWestinghouse nuclear services division.andP;  &quot;The advanced technologies to bedeveloped by CRW Robotics Partnership will strengthen our leadership in thesemarkets.&quot;andM;A committee composed of Vincent J. Esposito, service technology and trainingmanager for Westinghouse's nuclear services division, David M. Pahnos,assistant director of Carnegie Mellon's Field Robotics Center, and Simondswill jointly manage the new partnership.andP;  Carnegie Mellon also will maintaina financial interest in the technologies developed at the university andtransferred to CRW through licensing and usage fees.andM;(Barbara E.
