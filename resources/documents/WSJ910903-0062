A commonly offered benefit,company-sponsored plans let employees use group rates to buycoverage of one, two or three times salary. And the employerdoes all the legwork.   But is it a good deal? Not always. &quot;You would think thatgroup insurance would be cheaper, but sometimes it isn't,&quot;says Peter Katt, a West Bloomfield, Mich., life-insuranceadviser. &quot;You really have to check it out.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Indeed, insurance advisers like Mr. Katt are full ofstories about employer-sponsored plans -- or group plansoffered through professional associations -- offeringcoverage that costs 20%, 50% or even 100% more than policiestheir clients could buy on the open market.   Supplemental plans -- which typically offer renewable terminsurance -- have their appeal. Employers like thesepayroll-deduction plans because they inexpensively upgradetheir benefits package. And acceptance by employees is high-- around 40% to 60%, says one insurer -- because it avoidsshopping around, writing premium checks or taking a physical.   &quot;A lot of people sign up and don't actually go out and askwhat the rates are elsewhere,&quot; says Don Gaias of consultantTPFandamp;C in New York. &quot;They figure the employer must havechecked it out.&quot;   But employees who do compare rates may be surprised. Forexample, consider a plan underwritten by NorthwesternNational Life Insurance Co., Minneapolis. Under the plan,called Add Life, a 45-year-old employee would pay $444 a yearfor $100,000 of additional term life insurance through thecompany. But the first-year premium for the same coveragefrom Massachusetts's Savings Bank Life Insurance would beonly $222.   No low-cost SBLI in your state? That 45-year-old employeewould still do significantly better buying on the outsidethan with this particular plan, says James A. Margolis, aBoston insurance agent. A survey of individual policies fromfour other companies found first-year premiums ranging from$156 to $320.   Younger employees fare a bit better with Add Life. A30-year-old man would find its $144 premium lower than threeof the other five policies surveyed, with the low-cost SBLIcheapest at $99. But a 30-year-old woman can do better on herown with three of the five.   Michael Helmick, vice president, sales, at NorthwesternNational, says the Add Life &quot;rates might be a little higher&quot;because the plan is an off-the-shelf product. It uses broadactuarial tables and blends together a variety of risks tocome up with a simplified underwriting system, he explains.Other group plans, he says, may make different assumptions.   Large companies, for example, typically buy plans based ontheir own death experience, says James Miller, manager ofhealth plans at Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., Hartford, Conn.Thus, their rates could be 20% or more lower than the AddLife plan. Some plans are weighted to favor older employees.Other companies choose to subsidize premium payments, makingthe company plans a good deal no matter what the underlyingassumptions.   In general, however, plan assumptions tend to increase thecost of many work-sponsored plans for healthy people,nonsmokers and women. For example, the Add Life product, likemany similar policies, makes no distinction between men andwomen, smokers and nonsmokers. Thus a nonsmoking woman and amale smoker would get the same rates, even though the woman'slife expectancy is significantly greater.   Moreover employer-sponsored plans typically don't requirea physical and often guarantee insurability. Plans withguaranteed insurability are a great deal for people who aresick. &quot;Anyone with a health issue is going to take advantageof it,&quot; says David Bohl, senior tax manager at ArthurAndersen andamp; Co., Milwaukee.   But with a higher number of sick people participating, theinsurer is likely to have more deaths and, thus, moreexpenses. And that pushes rates up.   People who want to compare rates may want to contact alow-load, no-commission operation, thus avoiding ahigh-pressure pitch for permanent insurance, says Mr. Katt,the Michigan insurance adviser. He recommends either USAALife andamp; Health Insurance Co. (800-531-8000) or Ameritas LifeInsurance Corp. (800-552-3553), saying both give quotes overthe phone.   Other factors when considering employer-sponsoredsupplemental coverage include the likelihood that you willchange jobs. In some cases, plans aren't &quot;portable&quot; -- whichmeans that when you leave your job, you also leave behindyour life insurance. In other cases, you can take your policywith you, but only if you convert it to more expensivepermanent life insurance.   Given the turmoil in the life-insurance industry, thestability of the company underwriting the insurance plan mayalso be a consideration. But Virginia Applegarth, aninsurance specialist with TFC Financial Management in Boston,says this is less of a worry with company-sponsored plans,which tend to involve only term insurance. She says even incases of insolvency, death benefits are still being &quot;paid infull.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
