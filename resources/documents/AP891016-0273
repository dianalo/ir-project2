Boeing and the Machinists union were told a meeting would beheld in the offices of federal mediator Douglas Hammond at 1 p.m.Wednesday, two weeks after 57,800 workers walked off the job.   ``Both sides will be here and we'll play it by ear from thenon,'' said Hammond, of the Federal Mediation and ConciliationService.   Hammond said there was no particular reason for choosingWednesday to resume negotiations. It was ``just a matter of meassessing the situation and deciding it was time to get themback,'' he said.   Boeing spokesman Harold Carr would say little beyond confirmingthe new round of talks and that Boeing's chief negotiator, LarryMcKean, would be there.   Asked whether Boeing had modified its contract proposal to theMachinists, Carr said, ``I am not going to comment on anythinghaving to do with the proposal itself. Really, we just agreed tomeet.''   Union spokesman Matt Bates said he didn't think Hammond had toldunion officials of any specific reason for calling the parties backtogether.   ``Whether there was movement or not I really wouldn't know,''Bates said. ``Our position is that you can't settle a disputewithout talking. ... We welcome a chance to see whether Boeing hasre-evaluated its position. At this point we don't know.''   The 57,800 members of the International Association ofMachinists and Aerospace Workers at Boeing struck Oct. 4 aftervoting 85 percent against a new contract offer from the world'slargest commercial jet builder, which is enjoying its fifthstraight year of record-high orders.   About 43,300 strikers are in the Seattle area; 12,000 inWichita, Kan.; 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and lesser numbers at ahalf-dozen other locations.   Paul Nisbet, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. inNew York, said he thinks both sides probably are feeling increasingpressure, and that Hammond's call back to the table illustrates ``alittle bit of impatience with both sides not attempting to breachthe gap between the two.''   Pressure would come not only from airlines concerned abouton-time deliveries of their planes and from striking workersmissing paychecks, but also from a variety of government agenciesworried about the inflationary effects of high wage demands, thefallout from the strike on military contractors around the country,and the effects on the nation's trade balance, in which expensiveBoeing airplanes play a significant role, Nisbet said.   ``With the total lack of any visible indication that there's anymovement on either side, there's growing concern outside thecompany,'' he said.   The news of resumed negotiations came the same day that thefirst round of full, face-to-face negotiations began between Boeingand its second-largest union, which represents engineers andtechnical workers mostly in the Seattle area.   Dan Mahoney, general counsel of the Seattle ProfessionalEngineering Employees Association, was in the talks and notimmediately for comment Monday. But he said earlier that talksprobably would be held sporadically as needed over the next threeweeks.   The enineering union's contract expires Dec. 1, but no oneexpects a strike by the unaffiliated group, which represents nearly28,000 engineers, scientists, manual writers, draftsmen and othertechnical workers. About 95 percent are in the Puget Sound area,with the rest in Portland, Ore., and at scattered air bases inCalifornia, Utah and Florida.   Because of mail voting procedures, the soonest a second strikecould occur would be early January, Mahoney said.   Boeing's three-year offer to the machinists included wage hikesof 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent, bonuses of 8 percent ofgross pay this year and 3 percent in 1990, a cost-of-living clausealmost matching inflation, a reduction in mandatory overtime andincreases in some benefits.   After nearly two weeks on picket lines, striking workerscontinue to be in good spirits, Bates said Monday.   ``They know better than anybody that you cannot even dream ofbuilding airplanes without the people in there and their highlyspecialized skills,'' he said. ``And until Boeing develops an offerthey know there are no airplanes that are going to be built.''</TEXT></DOC>
