Premier Hans Modrow meanwhile it is about to impose ``unpopularmeasures'' aimed at curbing black-market currency trading that hasflourished since the lifting of travel restrictions on Nov. 9.   Modrow's statement, as reported by the official news agency ADN,left unclear whether the leadership will try to cut down on thenumber of East Germans who can travel to the West. More than 6million visitors have already reached West Germany and West Berlin.   In West Germany, the mass-circulation Bild newspaper said Krenzcould be ousted as the nation's top leader within four weeks. Krenzhimself acknowledged in a television interview Sunday he could losehis power during a party congress scheduled for Dec. 15-17.   On Monday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's visiting chief of staff,Rudolf Seiters, predicted East Germany will hold free elections assoon as next fall. He also said he expects the Communists'constitutional guarantee of government control to be eliminatednext year.   Also today, the European Community said an envoy would visitEast Berlin Dec. 4 and 5 to discuss East Germany's request for abroad trade and economic cooperation accord.   There has been intense speculation about Krenz's future over thepast week. Major changes are expected soon in East Germany'sleadership, which includes both reformers as well as holdovers fromthe era of hard-liner Erich Honecker.   The state-run National-Zeitung daily newspaper reminded itsreaders that Krenz belonged to the ``leadership body that is now inthe crossfire of criticism.''   In its commentary today, the newspaper also emphasized Krenz'spraise for the Chinese leadership after it crushed the studentpro-democracy movement in June, and brought up Krenz's alleged rolein massive election fraud in May.   ``Egon Krenz cannot make up lost ground,'' the commentary said.   East Germany's state-run press, which used to reflect the partyleadership's line without fail, has been reporting a greatervariety of views in recent weeks.   In Hamburg, the conservative Bild newspaper said in a front-pageheadline: ``Experts Agree: Krenz Has Only Four Weeks.''   Bild did not name the experts. The newspaper is published by thegiant Springer group, which long has been critical of EastGermany's leadership.   The official ADN news agency said more than 400,000 took to thestreets of Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, and Karl-Marx-Stadt in what hasbecome a Monday night ritual of challenge to Communist rule.   Street protests that began last month and a mass emigration ofyoung skilled workers have prompted a shakeup in country'sleadership, exacting from it promises of fundamental reform and theopening of the country's borders to free travel on Nov. 9.   In Leipzig, demonstrators denounced government errors that haveruined the economy.   Most of East Germany's organized opposition groups are believedto oppose German reunification, but there were calls for Germanunity among some at the Leipzig rally.   ``We must not suppress the will for unity. We are one people,''one unidentified speaker said.   Seiters met with Krenz and Modrow for talks to work out a visitby Kohl next month.   No date has been set for the visit, but it is expected beforeChristmas and after the East German Communist Party congress onDec. 15-17.   During the talks Monday, Krenz indicated the Communist Party isstriving for free general elections, but that their date dependedon how quickly the Parliament would pass the new election law,Seiters told reporters.   The West German official, Kohl's troubleshooter for EastGermany, talked for three hours with Krenz and Modrow in thepresence of aides and then had a 45-minute private chat with thetop Communists.</TEXT></DOC>
