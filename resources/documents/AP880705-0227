On no issue have Reagan's policies come under more sustainedassault than in Central America _ Abrams' turf _ but Abrams'campaigns against cocaine smugglers and what he considersCuban-style communism there haven't gotten very far.   In the process, he has become a lightning rod for policyopponents' wrath, and he has often found himself the target ofcorrosive taunts on Capitol Hill and in the bureaucracy as well.   Abrams, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs,looks with pride on the democratic gains made through much of thehemisphere, but his efforts to dislodge two determined adversaries_ Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and Nicaragua's Sandinistagovernment _ seem to have misfired.   The policies Abrams has pursued are no less controversial thanhis style. Although he's only 40, few have seen more intellectualcombat than he has.   Few neutrals emerge when Abrams is the subject of conversation.A sampling of opinions: He's arrogant. He's brilliant. He'suntrustworthy. He's courageous. He's unscrupulous. He's principled.   ``I don't like the man,'' says former Ambassador Frank McNeil,using a stronger noun.   ``I wish him a long life,'' says Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.   Abrams has never been accused of obsequiousness in dealing withpeople who disagree with him.   ``This is a political battlefield,'' he says. ``The oppositionfights with every weapon available and we need to fight equallyhard.''   Off duty, the Abrams glower so familiar to opponents disappears,as does the mantle of the no-apologies crusader.   Dawn finds him toasting frozen waffles for his three smallchildren (on weekends he makes French toast from scratch). Late atnight, he can be found curled up with a novel. But, during workinghours, it's the combat zone.   The combat zone was livelier than usual during the Iran-Contrahearings last year. It developed that Abrams had earlier misledCongressional committees about fund solicitations for the Contrasand U.S. involvement in an ill-fated resupply flight for theNicaraguan rebels.   From the Democratic camp came predictable cries for Abrams'resignation. He didn't oblige.   Some blame him for the administration's more recent policysetbacks, accusing him of flawed tactics and an abrasive style thatalienates potential allies. His supporters fault Congress as balkyand shortsighted, ``irresolute'' friends in Latin America, hostilemedia, bureaucratic infighting and the intractable nature of theproblems he inherited.   Abrams is a ``neoconservative.'' He worked for two Democraticsenators _ Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and the late HenryJackson of Washington state _ and, in the 1980 campaign, for theelection of Ronald Reagan. He is a native of New York City and aproduct of Harvard.   Abram's wife, Rachel, is the daughter of Norman Podhoretz,editor of Commentary magazine, and Midge Decter, a champion ofconservative causes.   After defecting to the Republican Party, he joined theadministration in 1981, becoming, at age 33, the youngest personever with the rank of assistant secretary of state. He has had thattitle as head of three bureaus _ international organizations, humanrights and, since 1985, Latin America.   American aid to the anti-Sandinista cause has been an article offaith with Abrams. When Congress last February rejected furthermilitary shipments to the Contras, Abrams thought it wouldundermine them in negotiations with their foes _ perhaps fatally.   The next blow came in May, with the collapse of Abrams'negotiating efforts to induce Noriega's departure. It wasespecially pams had seen there a chance to furtherdemocracy in the hemisphere while ridding Panama of a leader whowas under indictment in the United States on drug-dealing charges.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
