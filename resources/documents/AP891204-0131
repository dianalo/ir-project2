WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush on Monday endorsed acautious and measured approach to reunifying Germany, instillinggratitude in West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl but wariness amongsome other NATO allies.   Bush indicated at a special session of Western alliance leadersthat a single German state still loyal to NATO would express theyearning of Germans for unity as well as the right to a nation'sself-determination.   ``We are not trying to accelerate the process,'' Bush later tolda news conference wrapping up his talks with allied leaders here.``It's better to let things move on their own.''   But his concept of a reunified Germany within a future Europebound by common goals and values gave new life to an issue thatstirs concern on both sides of the East-West divide.   ``Self-determination must be pursued without prejudice to itsoutcome,'' Bush told reporters in recapping his views onreunification.   He said West Germany must remain committed to NATO and theEuropean Community, ``with due regard for the legal role andresponsibilities of the Allied powers,'' and said reunificationwould have to be ``peaceful, gradual, and part of a step-by-stepbasis.''   He said he thought Kohl ``feels comfortable'' with the U.S.terms on rejoining the two Germanys, and stressed that no timeframe has been identified for reunification.   Kohl expressed thanks for Bush's ``support on those questions ofconcern to us Germans.''   The ``German Question'' dominated and intensified the alliancegathering called to discuss the weekend summit in Malta with Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, which also dwelled heavily on thedemocratic reform wave eroding Europe's political divide.   The changes reshaping Eastern Europe most directly affect theGermans, who have been separated since World War II into the rivalcamps of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.   Kohl spelled out his own 10-point plan for reunification beforethe special NATO gathering, and complained that some allies haverejected it without study.   ``People outside Germany are speaking of these plans withouteven having read them,'' the chancellor said, declining to name theNATO leaders who oppose the quest for reunification.   ``We are most grateful to the (U.S.) president for having shownunderstanding and offered support for our position as Germans,''Kohl said. ``He also did so at Malta.''   In contrast, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher appearedat her post-summit briefing to be clearly perturbed by elements ofBush's address, though she did not specify the subject of Germanreunification.   ``We must continue NATO with present borders, because to doanything else would be to jeopardize the security that we seek,'' aBritish source who did not want to be named, quoted Mrs. Thatcheras telling the allies.   Kohl suggested that jealous over German economic might could beat the root of the opposition.   ``West Germany, with its economic power, is already too strongfor the liking of many,'' the chancellor said pointedly.   The combined German nations would have a population of nearly 80million with which to fuel the economic locomotive that has alreadymade West Germany the biggest exporting nation in the world and thewealthiest per capita, according to some measures.   ``If we had this same discussion in 1982, when our economicsituation was completely different than that which exists in WestGermany today, the discussion would not have been so difficult,''Kohl said, making clear there was a debate over the unity plan.   Kohl sought to allay fears that a reunified Germany would poseany threat to either the NATO alliance or the stability of Europe.   He attempted to draw a distinction between the concept of``inviolable borders'' and ``untouchable borders.''   The 1976 Helsinki Act ensures the inviolability of present-dayEuropean borders, which opponents of reunification contend rulesout the recarving of a single Germany from the two currentlyexisting.   Kohl argued that border revisions of mutual consent between twostates are a matter of ``self-determination,'' another of therights recognized among the NATO allies and countries signing theHelsinki accords.   Kohl reiterated Bonn's promise that it seeks reunification in astep-by-step manner consistent with the European process that seeksdisarmament and erasure of military and political divisions.   ``Gorbachev's call for a common European home is that which wealso speak of in the process of reunification,'' Kohl said.''Everything we do in Germany is embedded in the development ofEurope overall.''   Bush said the emergence of a single German state would pose noproblem as long as West Germany stands by its commitments to theNATO alliance and the European Community.   And Kohl vowed that those principles are part of the bedrock ofWest German policy.   ``Solution of the German question is only possible under aEuropean roof,'' the chancellor said.   Attempting to convince some wary allies that West Germany isdevoted to assisting the whole of Eastern Europe in its drive fordemocracy, the chancellor noted that his government has establisheda billion-dollar relief fund for Poland and that his visit toHungary next week will provide aid for that reformist nation aswell.   But he conceded that ``understandably, the developments in EastGermany have distracted attention from developments in Poland andHungary'' among West Germans.</TEXT></DOC>
