Millions of dollars has been stolen from the program by peoplewho bribed foreign officials, set up dummy corporations, submittedfalse invoices and diverted U.S. aid to secret foreign bank accountsfrom which it could not be recovered, the Times said.   Under the new rules, foreign governments buying arms withAmerican loans would have to agree in advance to make their recordsand files available to federal investigators, the Times reported.   Likewise, American companies that want to sell weapons to aforeign government receiving American loans would have to giveinvestigators access to their records.   Military contractors have objected to the new rules as burdensomeand unnecessary. Lobbyists for arms exporters also expressed concern.   Joel L. Johnson, vice president of the American League forExports and Security Assistance, told the Times, ``These rules couldimpose an enormous, unnecessary administrative burden.   ``They are designed to make life easy for prosecutors. They arenot likely to deter fraud above and beyond the currentregulations,'' he added.   But the Justice Department said it faced ``almost insurmountableproblems'' in investigating arms fraud cases involving foreigncountries, according to the Times.   The new rules were disclosed in letters to several major militarycontractors from Lt. Gen. Charles W. Brown, director of the DefenseSecurity Assistance Agency, and his deputy, Glenn A. Rudd, the Timesreported. The agency supervises foreign military sales.   The Justice Department told the Times that investigatingcorruption in arms aid has been especially difficult in thePhilippines, El Salvador and Egypt.</TEXT></DOC>
