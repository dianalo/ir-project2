But he ruled out elections until Washington liftseconomic sanctions.   Provisional President Francisco Rodriguez, in a speech lateFriday before his first day in office, said, ``I am sure there aremany important interests of the United States that can be compatiblewith the national interests of Panama without undermining theirprestige or sacrificing our dignity.''   He said he would lead the country to ``a new democracy as soon asAmerican aggression ceases and the funds arbitrarily withheld by theUnited States government are returned to the national treasury, sothat conditions of institutional normality can be re-established.''   He also called for ``a guarantee that elections can be heldwithout foreign interference and manipulation.''   The United States has frozen about $300 million in Panamanianassets in an effort to topple Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the powerbehind the civilian government. Washington has also been withholdingPanama Canal fees since early 1988 and has imposed trade sanctionsthat include a ban on any payments, including taxes, to thePanamanian government.   U.S. Embassy officials said Friday the American government iscompiling a list of companies and individuals associated withNoriega for the purpose of blocking them from doing any businesswith any Americans.   The U.S. government considers Rodriguez a puppet of Noriega, whocommands Panama's police and military. The United States launchedits anti-Noriega campaign after he was indicted by two federal grandjuries in Florida on drug-trafficking charges in February 1988.   Noriega denies those charges.   Rodriguez met Saturday with leaders of the government'sRevolutionary Democratic Party and other officials to try to form aCabinet.   In his speech Friday night, Rodriguez called on the U.S.government ``to rid itself of the inventions and myths created by... previous adminstrations.''   ``If we look at our differences in terms of the real world andwithout capricious fantasies, the many aspirations we share havemade possible our long association, including our alliance in twoworld wars,'' he said.   He also asked for Latin American solidarity, urging SouthAmerican governments to resist U.S. pressures to condemn Panama.   Venezuela and Costa Rica have asked for Noriega's resignation. Atleast eight Latin American countries have withdrawn ambassadorssince the May 7 elections in a sign of displeasure with thegovernment's decision to annul the vote.   International observers say the opposition won those elections ina landslide. The government annulled them.   Also Saturday, the European Economic Community, in a statementissued in Paris, said the administration in Panama is ``withoutinstitutional legitimacy.'' It called for a solution that wouldallow the Panamanian people to choose their own government.   Rodriguez, 50, was named president by the Panama's Council ofState. He was inaugurated in a brief ceremony Friday, when theprevious administration's term expired.</TEXT></DOC>
