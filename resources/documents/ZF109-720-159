(AMSC) in Washington, and Telesat Mobile Inc. (TMI) of Canadain Montreal.andM;Two contracts valued at approximately $100 million (U.S.) each call for AMSCand TMI to purchase jointly two of Hughes' newest line of satellites, thethree-axis body-stabilized HS 601.andP;  Hughes, a unit of GM Hughes Electronics,will provide the satellite bus and Spar is responsible for the communicationspayload.andP;  The program is known as MSAT.andM;AMSC and TMI will each own and operate one spacecraft, which will be the mosttechnologically advanced and most powerful ever built for commercial mobilecommunications.andP;  Each satellite has sufficient capacity to support up to3,000 radio channels.andP;  The satellites will cover the entire continentalUnited States and Canada, as well as Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the VirginIslands and 200 miles of United States and Canadian coastal waters, and willhave the capability to cover Mexico.andM;Both operators will provide complementary mobile telephone, radio, data andpositioning service to land, aviation and maritime users.andP;  Both also willprovide each other with backup and restoration capacity.andM;The spacecraft are due to be launched in early 1994, and they are compatiblewith most of the world's expendable launch vehicles.andM;The spacecraft will use the HS 601 multipurpose cube-shaped bus to operatethree transponders: one linking feeder stations to mobile users via a Ku-banduplink and an L-band downlink; a reverse transponder linking mobile users toearth stations via an L-band uplink and Ku-band downlink; and onecrosslinking earth stations via a Ku-band uplink and downlink.andM;Each MSAT spacecraft features an L-band payload of two 6-meter-by-5-metermesh reflector antennas and solid-state power amplifiers permitting receptionand transmission via small, low-power portable terminals similar to cellulartelephones.andP;  The Ku-band payload provides transmission between the satelliteand the feeder earth stations.andM;This agreement represents Hughes' fifth HS 601 contract, and brings the totalordered in 1990 alone to 12.andP;  Other customers are Aussat Pty.andP;  Ltd. ofAustralia, the U.S.andP;  Navy, Hughes Communications Inc. and Societe Europeennedes Satellites of Luxembourg.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
