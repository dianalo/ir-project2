Mayor James L. Usry, 67 years old, was arrested at his home after an eight-month investigation by the New Jersey State Police and the state attorney general's office into a variety of alleged bribe activities throughout the city government.    All together, 13 persons were arrested, including the president of Atlantic City's city council, two city council members, the chairman of the city's zoning board, the city's former housing authority director, a member of Atlantic County's governing council, and a candidate for a seat to that office.    With the mayor and three of Atlantic City's nine city council members behind bars much of yesterday, Atlantic City's remaining elected officials were unsure who was in control of the city.    According to law enforcement officials, Mr. Usry accepted $6,000 in cash last week from an undercover informant wearing a hidden tape recorder. In exchange, Mr. Usry allegedly promised to seek a change in a city ordinance that would have permitted a motor cart franchise owner access to the city's boardwalk during the summer.    &quot;This is just between you and me,&quot; Mr. Usry allegedly said as he accepted the cash.    Mr. Usry couldn't be reached to comment, either at his home or his office. He was released on his own recognizance following a bond hearing in the afternoon. Mr. Usry is a former basketball player for the Harlem Globetrotters and former assistant school superintendent in Atlantic County.    The alleged bribe is the only aspect of the criminal investigation that touched Mr. Usry. The investigation began in November when a prominent Atlantic City businessman, Albert Black, complained to state police that he was approached by the city's former housing authority director and a business associate about paying a bribe in return for a commercial zoning change. The criminal complaints are all based on evidence developed by Mr. Black as an undercover informant. They allege that city officials accepted $60,000 in bribes in return for favorable zoning board votes, exemptions from city rent control ordinances and promises of influence peddling concerning an airport gift shop franchise and the proposed ordinance change regulating motor carts on the Boardwalk.    Mr. Usry, Atlantic City's first black mayor and president of the National Conference of Black Mayors, is expected to retain his mayoral office unless he is convicted, said city business administrator Carl Briscoe. The previous mayor, Michael Matthews, pleaded guilty to accepting a bribe from an undercover federal agent posing as a businessman in search of city property for a casino. </TEXT></DOC>
