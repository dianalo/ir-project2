Bork. &quot;The rest of the country now sees Washington as a stinking swamp of intellectual dishonesty and political reprisal,&quot; the editorial continues, in what I assume is in non-hyperbolic fashion.    Two points here: 1) It was Judge Bork who defeated Judge Bork. The opposition to Judge Bork, both within the Senate and among the electorate, reached majority proportions after his 30 hours of testimony before the Judiciary Committee and the entire country. Judge Bork painted a portrait of himself that confirmed what his critics had been saying all along: that he had been wrong on so many of the basic issues of justice in our times and that his claim to have changed his mind was unconvincing. When the Judiciary Committee members asked him about civil rights, women's rights, free speech and the right to privacy, Judge Bork was deaf to the probing that came from the hearts and souls, as well as the minds, of his questioners. Above all, he failed to do what another conservative nominee, Sandra Day O'Connor, had done so well: to convey a commitment to the traditional role of the Supreme Court as the ultimate guardian of individual liberty.    2) Judge Bork had no need to &quot;defend himself at the level of discourse preferred by the creator of Archie Bunker.&quot; The public debate was conducted by nearly 300 organizations concerned with issues ranging from civil rights and women's rights to health care and education. It was those groups, representing millions of Americans, that helped to defeat the nomination, through exhaustive research of Judge Bork's record and reasoned argument against his views. But, more important, Judge Bork was eventually opposed by the majority of Americans who do not belong to organized groups and by moderate Republican and Democratic senators who, as often as not, vote against the positions favored by the organized groups opposing the nomination. What defeated Judge Bork wasn't the famous &quot;special interests&quot; but a national consensus on the public interest in individual liberty and equal justice.
