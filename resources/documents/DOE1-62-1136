<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-62-1136 </DOCNO><TEXT>The patent describes a controller for controlling the speed of a multiphaseinduction motor so as to maintain the motor in phase with an alternating-currentpower supply signal that is subject to meandering in frequency abouta nominal line frequency. The motor includes power amplifiers havingoutputs which drive the respective stator windings of the motor, comprising:shaft revolution sensor means operable to provide a feedback pulse trainsignal having frequency representative of the speed of the motor; phaseerror signal representative of the phase difference between the alternating-currentpower supply signal and the feedback pulse train signal; speed errorsignal generator means for generating a speed error signal that is representativeof the different between the speed of the motor and a predetermined desiredspeed; drift error signal generator means for generating a drift errorsignal representative of the integral of the phase error signal overtime; a summing amplifier for combining the speed phase and drift errorsignals to produce a single motor control signal.</TEXT></DOC>
