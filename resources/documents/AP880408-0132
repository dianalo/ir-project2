The Federal Reserve said consumer debt increased at an annualrate of 10.3 percent in February, down slightly from the 12.2percent rate of growth in January. In that month, installment debthad risen by $6.24 billion following a December increase of $4.3billion.   Analysts credited the big increases to strong auto sales.Domestic automakers reported earlier this week that they had theirbest January-March sales period since 1985, gains that were helpedby incentive programs.   This strong consumer demand has eased fears that the Octobercollapse of the stock market would frighten Americans into slowingspending so much that the country could be faced with a recessionthis year.   ``We are seeing a stronger first quarter than we had initiallyexpected. One of the favorable developments is the final round oftax cuts consumers are getting because of the 1986 tax law,'' saidSandra Shaber, an economist with the Wasington-based Futures Group.   Consumer spending is crucial to the country's economic healthbecause it accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity.Consumer spending grew 1.9 percent last year, after adjusting forinflation, and Ms. Shaber said she is looking for similar moderategrowth this year.   She said this forecast could be jeopardized if interest ratesstart rising significantly, boosting the costs of credit purchases.   Rates have been rising in recent weeks as the Federal Reservehas apparently tightened up slightly on credit to keep the economyfrom overheating. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. saidfixed-rate mortgages rose in the current week to 10.19 percent from10.05 percent last week.   In February, the credit report said, auto loans rose by $3.31billion, a 14.7 percent annual rate of increase, after rising by$2.7 billion in January.   The category that includes credit card debt rose by $1.49billion in Febuary, down from a January increase of $2.76 billion.   The debt category that includes loans from banks and creditunions not secured by real estate edged up $564 million in Februaryafter a small gain of $807 million in January.   The various changes left total consumer debt at $619.2 billionat the end of February, an increase of 8.9 percent from a yearearlier.</TEXT></DOC>
