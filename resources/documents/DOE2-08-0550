This energy limit reflects the fact that only intermediatenucleon-nucleon (NN) states are considered. The NN propagator is constructedin a separable potential model, the parameters of which are fitted todescribe the experimental NN scattering phase shifts. The problem ofgauge invariance of the Compton amplitude is analyzed and the role ofnonlocal currents is discussed. The low-energy theorem is satisfied.Our approach enables a direct calculation of both the real and imaginarypart of the Compton scattering amplitude. It turns out that the strongestmultipoles are dominated by the Born terms. Numerical results are comparedto a previous dispersion theoretical calculation, and we find a strongdisagreement between both calculations. We are led to conclude that certainassumptions made in the dispersion theoretical calculation are not justified.</TEXT></DOC>
