In Japan, greater attention hasbeen attracted to such radioisotope transfer into plants and then intohuman bodies. Thus the present report reviews various studies on thisissue. The key parameter for this process is the transfer factor (alsocalled concentration factor, coefficient or ratio). The factor largelydepends on various other factors including the characteristics of differentnuclides, properties of soil (pH, oxidation-reduction potential, grainsize distribution, contents of clay minerals, contents of organic matters,water content, etc.), characteristics of crops and cultivation conditions.It has been reported that I is absorbed by plants more rapidly than IO/sub3/. Of the various soil parameters, the pH of soil has the greatest effecton the transfer factor. Soil is mostly alkaline in Europe and Americawhile acid soil account for a great part in Japan, suggesting that thetransfer factor would be greater in Japan. The total potassium contentin soil has the second largest effect on the factor. Radioactive iodinehas shown to be transferred into soy beans and spinach 30 times morerapidly than into fruit vegetables. The oxidation-reduction potentialalso has a significant influence on the transfer factor. (Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
