In many wells this requirement can preclude maximizingproduction through the use of high-capacity artificial lift techniquessuch as jet pumping. An innovative approach has been developed and fieldtested in the McArthur River Field, Cook Inlet, Alaska, to overcome problemsassociated with incorporating subsurface safety valves in jet pump completions.This method provides surface control over the valve and does not restrictproduction rate. In this approach, a SSSV was placed in the tubing stringbelow a jet pump at 9,800 ft [3,000m] TVd to satisfy safety requirements.The design of the system allows the SSSv to be controlled from the surfacewithout depending upon hydraulic control lines to surface. The designwas later improved to allow the SSSV to be reverse circulated from thewell for repairs or remedial activities.</TEXT></DOC>
