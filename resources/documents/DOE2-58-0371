The main questionswere predicting the needs of energy, creating the models of factoriesand power plants, and simulation and optimization methods based on thepredictions and the plant models. Also there is the need of communicationnetwork between units far apart each other. The communication networkmust be highly dependable and reasonably priced. Other requirements areexpandability, adaptability for future technical alterations and expertservices of the company managing the communications. Afora Oy, in co-operationwith KTM, the Finnish Ministery of Commerce and Industry, carried outa parallel study of the realization of the plant models and the companymodels /sup K/onsernitason energianhankinnan simulointiympaeristoen luomminen/sup./ In both this and the Afora study the conclusions were the same. Itis possible to carry out the simulations and the optimizations of boththe plantlevel and the company level as an off-line routine and acchievegood results in the economical control of the utilization of energy.The company has decided to build a computerized central control plantfor controlling energy utilization. The cost of this plant is about 8million FIM. The pay-back time of the investment is estimated to be 1.4years.</TEXT></DOC>
