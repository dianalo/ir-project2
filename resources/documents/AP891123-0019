Millions of East Germans have crossed as tourists into WestGermany since Nov. 9, taking advantage of their new freedom to seethe long-forbidden West and buy goods not available at home.   As of Wednesday, nearly 11 million East German citizens hadreceived visas to travel to the West. East Germany has a populationof 16.5 million.   But the stream of East Germans crossing into West Germany withthe intention of staying has not stopped despite East Germany'spromises of political and economic reforms.   East Germany granted free travel to assauge growing publicunrest and the tens of thousands of its citizens fleeing across theborders. More than 200,000 have fled permanently this year, many ofthem young skilled workers including doctors and teachers.   The federal Interior Ministry said Wednesday that within theprevious 24 hours 1,694 East German resettlers had arrived in WestGermany.   Since East Germany opened its borders on Nov. 9, about 44,000East Germans have arrived as permanent residents, the ministry said.   The continuing stream of resettlers indicates continuingpessimism that conditions, especially economic ones, in EastGermany will be dramatically changing for the better anytime soon.   Nonetheless, the stream of East Germans coming as tourists isfar greater.   More than half a million East German tourists crossed into WestGermany and West Berlin on Tuesday, crowding downtown streets andjamming into stores.   But it was an official holiday in the West on Wednesday, andborder police said the stream had ebbed considerably _ somethingover 10,000. Banks that hand out 100 marks, $55, in freegovernment-donated ``welcome money,'' as well as most stores, wereclosed for the day.   ``I have not seen it this quiet in 14 days. Our colleagues withthe GDR (German Democratic Republic) border guards are finallygetting a breather,'' said Wolfgant Schlee, spokesman for theBavarian border police in Munich.   The influxes of East German tourists have caused huge trafficbackups at East German border crossings as the travelers line up tocross into the West in their sputtering Trabant and Wartburg sedans.   West Berlin police said streets there were also quieter.   ``But travel from West (Berlin) to East (Berlin) has increased.Many people wanted to use the holiday to have a look at the Easternside,'' said a West Berlin police spokesman, who did not give hisname.   The open borders also have fueled the East German black market.The Communist government on Wednesday announced a ban on theremoval of antiques and consumer goods that might be sold abroad.   The anti-smuggling effort was announced late Wednesday by EastGermany's official ADN news agency, which gave no details of therestrictions except to say that they were effective immediately.   Both government and opposition forces have called for morestringent customs controls to prevent East Germans from takingtheir valuables to the West and selling them for hard currency.</TEXT></DOC>
