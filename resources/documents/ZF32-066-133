(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Robert L. ScheierandM;Heidi Fisk, a senior training consultant with The St. Paul Companies Inc.,andO;bought user training from Businessland Inc., but it didn't work out.andM;&quot;Their training was just a poor stepchild,&quot; she said, compared to the chain'smain goals of selling hardware and software.andP;  &quot;The quality of the instructorsreally varied.&quot;andM;Now the St. Paul, Minn., insurance firm relies on independent training firmsbecause, Fisk said, &quot;they have more at stake&quot; and spend more money to makesure every instructor is qualified.andM;Fisk's experience is not unique.andP;  Many resellers routinely bungle theopportunity to sell training, even though training can represent the highestprofit margins -- or only profit margins -- in a total system sale.andM;PC users bought $1.4 billion worth of training from outside vendors in 1990,a figure that is expected to grow to $2.8 billion by 1995, according toLedgeway/Dataquest, a Framingham, Mass., market researcher.andM;Ledgeway research also found users are more likely to buy training from anoutside vendor than any other service, making for a huge untapped market.andM;Training can generate gross profit margins of 50 percent or more, comparedwith only 15 percent to 20 percent on hardware and software, said SusanScott, an analyst with Merrin Information Resources Inc., a market-researchfirm in Palo Alto, Calif.andM;But despite such potential, most resellers &quot;don't do a good job of sellingtraining,&quot; said Robert Ramers, president of Reseller Resources, a CorteMadera, Calif., consulting firm.andM;One main reason, he said, is that many resellers don't see training as avaluable product worth an investment in time and money.andM;Ramers, who is also an organizational psychologist, surveyed several thousandresellers and found most of them are more comfortable with technology thanwith teaching people.andM;Because they &quot;don't know how to do training and many of them don't enjoyandlsqb;it],&quot; many resellers avoid training, said Ramers.andM;&quot;Training is an intangible thing,&quot; said Harvey Feldstein, president ofLogical Operations Inc., a Rochester, N.Y., PC training firm.andP;  That makes ita difficult sell for sales forces accustomed to selling hardware andsoftware.andM;Another challenge is the mental leap a salesperson must make from viewingtraining as a necessary evil that drives up a system's price to seeingtraining as a valuable product in and of itself.andM;Some resellers and systems integrators are already using training to boostweak profit margins.andM;One example is AC3 Computer Center Inc., a dealer chain based in Birmingham,Ala., that is evolving into a VAR and systems integrator.andM;As of January, training made up less than 1 percent of sales, and the firmaveraged 11 percent gross profit margins, said Regional Manager Jim Everidge.andM;Today, training makes up about 7 percent of revenue, and gross profit marginshave risen to more than 20 percent.andP;  By January 1992, Everidge expectstraining services and software to account for 12 percent to 15 percent ofrevenue.andM;The star in Everidge's training stable is multi-media -- training softwarefrom Comsell Inc. of Atlanta that combines video, sound and on-screendemonstrations to teach users how to use software.andM;In January, he used promotional funds from IBM to buy the Comsell softwareand 28 PS/2s on which to run it.andP;  &quot;We've had little capital outlay, so allthe revenue we generate [from the multimedia classes] now is pure cash flow,&quot;he said.andM;When a customer walks in the door for a 12-hour multimedia course, whichcosts between $175 and $300, the only out-of-pocket cost to Everidge is &quot;12bucks for the training manual,&quot; making for a whopping 90 percent gross profitmargin.andM;That's the sort of creative thinking that it takes to sell trainingsuccessfully.andM;Logical Operations sells some of its PC training through resellers.andP;  Thereseller sells Logical Operations' training services to small-businessaccounts that the training firm normally wouldn't find on its own, saidFeldstein.andM;Many resellers have been fickle players in the training game, he said.andP;  &quot;I'veseen [reseller] organizations get into it and then seen them get out of itand then seen them get into it,&quot; Feldstein said.andM;One example is Businessland, which was acquired by systems integrator JWPInc. in July.andP;  JWP officials, in Purchase, N.Y., said Businessland disbandedits training operations earlier this year as the company struggled to stayafloat.andP;  But over the last year, they said, JWP has been ramping up its owntraining services.andM;The biggest key to selling training successfully, though, is selling it as asolution to a business problem.andM;That means showing a customer the return on investment good trainingdelivers.andP;  Xerox Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and others give customersdetailed analyses of how training pays off in increased productivity.andM;It can also mean tailoring training to a particular vertical market, saidElliot Maise, president of The Maise Institute for Technology and TrainingInc., a Raquette Lake, N.Y., firm that teaches computer trainers and trainingmanagers.andM;&quot;Lawyers would rather go to a class on writing briefs [using PCs] than anintroduction to WordPerfect,&quot; he said.andM;Maise himself runs Windows 3.0 on his PC but doesn't have time to explore howfeatures such as Dynamic Data Exchange could increase his profits.andM;&quot;I'd pay someone $5,000 to come in and really make Windows make our businessmore efficient,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
