The company already has received MD-11 orders that, if completed, would have an indicated value of about $5 billion. But many analysts consider the venture risky because McDonnell Douglas hasn't received any orders from U.S. passenger airlines. Those carriers typically provide the most important market for makers of wide-body jets.    McDonnell Douglas's decision to go ahead with the aircraft was made by its directors at a special board meeting yesterday. The company said it would provide details for start-up production plans at a news conference today.    In a brief statement, the St. Louis-based aerospace concern and defense contractor said it has received orders from 12 customers for 52 MD-11s and options for an additional 40 aircraft. All of the customers are foreign companies, except for Federal Express Corp., a package-delivery concern based in Memphis, Tenn.    The planes sell for about $90 million to $100 million each, the company said. Based on that sales figure, the orders for the 52 aircraft have a value of between $4.7 billion and $5.2 billion. McDonnell Douglas has said that delivery of the first planes won't begin until 1990.    The MD-11 is a more fuel-efficient version of the DC-10; it can fly longer distances and it carries more passengers than its predecessor. Depending on the seating arrangement, an MD-11 can carry between 276 and 405 passengers.    McDonnell Douglas previously said it wouldn't build MD-11s unless it received an order from at least one domestic airline. Obtaining orders from a domestic carrier is considered important because the foreign market for wide-body jets won't be adequate over time. Getting one domestic carrier to sign up likely would prompt other U.S. carriers to start ordering the aircraft, analysts said.    Yesterday, a McDonnell Douglas spokesman said he wasn't sure whether Federal Express's order met the company's initial requirement for building the jets. On the surface, the order wouldn't seem to, because it isn't likely to prompt other U.S. carriers to follow suit since Federal Express has needs different from those of major passenger airlines.    Moreover, an official for Federal Express said the company's order &quot;would be for a very limited number of airplanes.&quot;    Analysts have said that a safer course for McDonnell Douglas would be to stick to production of its popular MD-80 jets. The McDonnell Douglas spokesman wouldn't elaborate on the decision to build the MD-11, but did say that talks with several U.S. carriers about possible MD-11 orders were continuing. Those carriers weren't identified.    The MD-11 could face stiff competition. Seattle-based Boeing Co. makes the 747 wide-body jet and the 767 two-engine jet. Airbus Industrie, a European consortium, also may come out with a special wide-body model, the A-340. McDonnell Douglas and Airbus had tried to collaborate on a single plane, but those talks fell through earlier this year.    &quot;McDonnell Douglas had to do something like this to maintain its presence in the market,&quot; said J.C. Longridge, vice president for marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. He added that if Airbus moves forward with its A-340, the three-way competition will &quot;bring back memories&quot; of the fierce struggle in the 1970s to capture the market for the wide-body jet.    That competition almost drove Lockheed Corp. into bankruptcy-law proceedings. Lockheed subsequently sought loan guarantees from the federal government and ultimately discontinued production of its L-1011 wide-body jet.    McDonnell Douglas announced its plans for the MD-11 after the stock market closed. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, McDonnell Douglas closed at $72.625 a share, down $1.875.    Along with Federal Express, British Caledonian Airways and Scandinavian Airlines Systems have been identified as having placed orders or preliminary orders for MD-11s. Yesterday, Alitalia, Italy's state-controlled airline, signed a letter of intent to buy 16 aircraft from McDonnell Douglas, including six MD-11s.    ---   Also contributing to this article were Eileen White in Los Angeles and John Helyar in Atlanta. </TEXT></DOC>
