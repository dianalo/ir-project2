Interim rule regulations werepublished at 53 FR 9274 (March 21, 1988).

L. 99-603 was enacted on November 6, 1986. TheService published implementing regulations at 52 FR 16205, May l, 1987,and amending regulations at 52 FR 43843, November 17, 1987; 53 FR 9274,March 2l, 1988; 53 FR 9862, March 28, 1988; and, at 53 FR 23382, June 22,1988. On December 22, 1987, the Department of State Authorization Bill,Pub. L. 100-204 was signed into law. Section 902 of the bill allows nationalsof Poland, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, and Uganda to apply for temporary residentstatus pursuant to the provisions of section 245A of the Immigration Reformand Control Act of 1986. Most of the same benefits, conditions, and responsibilitiesof section 245A of the INA have been extended to qualifying nationals ofthese countries. The eligibility requirements and application period differfrom those for aliens who are under the scope of the Immigration Reformand Control Act of 1986. Therefore, the Service is creating a new regulatorysection_``245a.4'' entitled ``Adjustment to Lawful Resident Status of CertainNationals of Countries for which Extended Voluntary Departure has beenmade Available.''At 53 FR 9274, March 21, 1988, the Service published an Interim Rule withrequest for comments. Twelve interested individuals and organizations submittedwritten comments. All comments were reviewed and given serious consideration.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of the Final Rule</ITAG>The provisions of the proposed rule which received comments will be discussedseparately. This final rule amends 8 CFR 245a.4 created under the provisionsof the March 21, 1988 interim rule published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> at 53 FR 9274. This final rule includes all changesmade from the interim rule which incorporates the requirements for certainnationals of countries for which extended voluntary departure was madeavailable to become temporary resident aliens of the United States undersection 245a.Under the definition of ``resided continuously,'' in andSection; 245a.4(a)(3)(i),one commentor stated that placing any travel restrictions on a temporaryresident was not equitable, and that temporary residents should be affordedthe same travel privileges and restrictions which permanent residents nowenjoy. Temporary residence is a unique status created by the ImmigrationReform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), not afforded the same privilegesand restrictions as that of the status of permanent residence. In fact,an applicant must satisfy an 18-month eligibility period as a temporaryresident prior to being permitted to apply for permanent residence. Therefore,the period of time required for eligibility under this section shall notbe changed and shall remain consistent with section 245a regulations.Section 245a.4(a)(4) pertaining to the definition of ``continuous residence''has been amended to reflect clarifying language as relates to adjustmentfrom temporary to permanent resident status under andSection; 245a.3.A commentor suggested that restrictive dates under the definition of ``continuousphysical presence'' of andSection; 245a.4(a)(6) be omitted. After givingthis recommendation serious consideration, the Service believes that thesedates are reasonable, within the intent of the statute, and consistentwith section 245a. Therefore, this definition will remain unchanged.The same commentor desired a change of ``brief, casual, and innocent,''as defined in 245a.4(a)(7) to reflect any departure which does not ``** * meaningfully interrupt continuous physical presence in the United States* * *.'' Again, after serious consideration, the Service believes thatthe definition is reasonable, within the intent of the statute, and consistentwith section 245a. The definition will remain unchanged.Clarifying language pertaining to andSection; 245a.4(a)(10), the definitionof ``public cash assistance,'' has been previously issued in relationshipto section 245a. Therefore, the Service believes that no need exists tofurther restrict the definition. The regulation concerning ``Special Rulefor Determination of Public Charge,'' however, has been expanded.Section 245a.4(a)(12), the definition of ``through the passage of time,''shall remain as stated in the Interim Rule. However, the term ``in an unlawfulstatus'' has been eliminated. A commentor suggested that andSection; 245a.4(b) (1) and (2) be extendedto nationals other than those from the four designated countries. The Servicewill not alter its position on this issue. The Congressional ConferenceCommittee report was clear as to which groups would qualify under thisstatute. Several comments were received concerning an applicant's ``unlawful status,''and that it should not be considered under andSection; 245a.4 because thestatute does not specifically address an alien's unlawful status. The statutedoes state, however, that in order to be considered as eligible under thissection, an applicant who entered the United States as a nonimmigrant beforeJuly 21, 1984, must establish that his or her period of authorized stayas a nonimmigrant expired not later than January 20, 1985, through thepassage of time; or, that the alien applied for asylum prior to July 21,1984. Therefore, in order to be considered eligible under this section,a nonimmigrant must not have had an authorized period of stay after January20, 1985. Accordingly, in andSection; 245a.4(b)(2)(i) (A) through (F), allother references to ``unlawful status,'' have been deleted. Several commentors pointed out a discrepancy in andSection; 245a.4(b)(2)(i)(E) and (F), concerning the dates of eligibility for nonimmigrants whopossess ``Duration of Status (D/S)'' expirations of authorized permissionto remain in the United States and those nonimmigrants who possess date-certainexpiration dates. In order to be consistent with the intent of the lawand in concurrence with the comments provided, the date relating to eligibilityis changed to ``January 21, 1985.'' Section 245a.4(b)(2)(i)(F) is also amended to clarify eligibility requirementsfor those students who were granted student status retroactively (``nuncpro tunc''). One commentor indicated that the exemption from the two-year foreign residencyrequirement of section 212(e) should be specifically stated in these regulations.The Service omitted this part from andSection; 245a.4(b)(3) from the requirementsof the Interim Rule of andSection; 245a.4 and believes that this is a sufficientindication of non-applicability to applicants under andSection; 245a.4. Several commentors asked for more flexibility in the requirements for documentationconcerning proof of nationality in andSection; 235a.4(b)(4)(ii). The Servicebelieves that proof of nationality is an integral factor in establishingeligibility under andSection; 245a.4. It is also understood that most applicantsunder this statute already have established a record with INS, either throughnonimmigrant status, extended voluntary departure requests, or asylum applications.Therefore, the Service has amended this part to include other credibledocumentation as acceptable evidence of an alien's nationality. Section 245a.4(b)(9) is amended to include specific language concerningthe serological test for the HIV virus. Section 245a.4(b)(11)(iv) is amended to reflect policy guidance concerningthe two-tiered evaluation method for determination of an applicant's likelihoodto become a public charge. Clarifying language is added to andSection; 245a.4(b)(14)(iv) to reflectthe status of an alien under the State Legalization Impact Assistance Grants(SLIAG) program upon denial of his or her temporary resident applicationand expiration of the appeal period. One commentor stated that clarifying language should be added to andSection;245a.4(b)(16) to coincide with the policy memorandum issued in referenceto andSection; 103.5a(b) of this Act. The Service agrees and has added theclarification. Other language clarifying the appeal process, includingthe filing of briefs, has also been added. Section 245a.4(b)(18) is amended to reflect clarifying language concerningcertification of remanded cases to the Administrative Appeals Unit. Numerous commentors recommended that the provisions of confidentialityunder section 245a be extended to applicants under andSection; 245a.4. Althoughthe statute does not specifically include confidentiality as it pertainsto these applicants, the confidentiality provisions will be extended tothis group. The Service believes that a definite need for a statement ofthe confidentiality provisions exists due to the close relationship tothe section 245a program and because the same reasons for confidentialitystill apply (individuals will not come forward due to fear of apprehensionif the guarantee of confidentiality is not extended to them; and, employerswill be reluctant to issue evidence of employment if guarantees of confidentialitydo not exist.) Therefore, the confidentiality provisions are stated ina new andSection; 245a.4(b)(23). Section 245a.4(c)(2) is amended to indicate that all provisions of andSection;245a.3 shall apply to aliens adjusting to permanent resident status. One commentor indicated a necessity for some type of travel documentationto be provided to applicants under this section, especially because ofan inability for members of this particular group to presently obtain passportsfrom their respective countries of nationality. The Service believes thatthis recommendation has merit, and is investigating the possibility ofpermitting applicants under this section to obtain refugee travel documentswithin already existing guidelines. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigrationand Naturalization Service certifies that this rule does not have a significantadverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Thisrule is not a major rule within the definition of section 1(b) of E.O.12291, nor does this rule have federalism implications warranting the preparationof a Federal assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612. The information collection requirements contained in this regulation havebeen cleared by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act. The OMB control numbers for these collectionsare contained in 8 CFR 299.5.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 8 CFR Part 245a </ITAG>Definitions, Temporary resident status, Permanent resident status.Accordingly, Chapter I of Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations isamended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 245a_ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS TO THAT OF PERSONS ADMITTED FOR LAWFULTEMPORARY OR PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS UNDER SECTION 245A OF THE IMMIGRATIONAND NATIONALITY ACT, AS AMENDED BY PUB.

The assumed name mustappear in the documentation provided by the applicant to establish eligibility.To meet the requirement of this paragraph, documentation must be submittedto prove the common identity, i.e., that the assumed name was in fact usedby the applicant.(B)<T3> Proof of common identity.</T3> The most persuasive evidence is a documentissued in the assumed name which identifies the applicant by photograph,fingerprint, or detailed physical description. Other evidence which willbe considered are affidavit(s) by a person or persons other than the applicant,made under oath, which identify the affiant by name and address, statethe affiant's relationship to the applicant and the basis of the affiant'sknowledge of the applicant's use of the assumed name. Affidavits accompaniedby a photograph which has been identified by the affiant as the individualknown to the affiant under the assumed name in question will carry greaterweight.(iv)<T3> Proof of residence._</T3>Evidence to establish proof of continuousresidence in the United States during the requisite period of time mayconsist of any combination of the following:(A) Past employment records, which may consist of pay stubs, W-2 Forms,certification of the filing of Federal income tax returns on IRS Form 6166,a state verification of the filing of state income tax returns, lettersfrom employer(s) or, if the applicant has been in business for himselfor herself, letters from banks and other firms with whom he or she hasdone business.

This affidavit form letter shall be signed,attested to by the employer under penalty of perjury, and shall state theemployer's willingness to come forward and give testimony if requested.(B) Utility bills (gas, electric, phone, etc.) receipts, or letters fromcompanies showing the dates during which the applicant received serviceare acceptable documentation.(C) School records (letters, report cards, etc.) from the schools thatthe applicant or his or her children have attended in the United Statesmust show the name of school and periods of school attendance.(D) Hospital or medical records showing treatment or hospitalization ofthe applicant or his or her children must show the name of the medicalfacility or physician and the date(s) of the treatment or hospitalization.(E) Attestations by churches, unions, or other organizations as to theapplicant's residence by letter which:(<T3>1</T3>) Identify applicant by name; (<T3>2</T3>) Are signed by an official (whose title is shown); (<T3>3</T3>) Show inclusive dates of membership; (<T3>4</T3>) State the address where applicant resided during membershipperiod; (<T3>5</T3>) Include the seal of the organization impressed on the letteror the letterhead of the organization, if the organization has letterheadstationery; (<T3>6</T3>) Establish how the author knows the applicant; and (<T3>7</T3>) Establish the origin of the information being attested to.(F) Additional documents to support the applicant's claim may include:(<T3>1</T3>) Money order receipts for money sent into or out of the country;(<T3>2</T3>) Passport entries; (<T3>3</T3>) Birth certificates of children born in the United States; (<T3>4</T3>) Bank books with dated transactions; (<T3>5</T3>) Letters or correspondence between applicant and other personor organization; (<T3>6</T3>) Social Security card; (<T3>7</T3>) Selective Service card; (<T3>8</T3>) Automobile license receipts, title, vehicle registration, etc.;(<T3>9</T3>) Deeds, mortgages, contracts to which applicant has been a party;(<T3>10</T3>) Tax receipts; (<T3>11</T3>) Insurance policies, receipts, or letters; and (<T3>12</T3>) Any other relevant document. (v) <T3>Proof of financial responsibility. </T3>An applicant for adjustmentto temporary resident status under this part is subject to the provisionsof section 212(a)(15) of the Act relating to excludability of aliens likelyto become public charges unless the applicant demonstrates a history ofemployment in the United States evidencing self-support without receiptof public cash assistance. The burden of proof to demonstrate the inapplicabilityof section 212(a)(15) of the Act lies with the applicant who may provide:(A) Evidence of a history of employment (i.e., employment letter, W-2 forms,income tax returns, etc.); (B) Evidence that he/she is self-supporting (i.e., bank statements, stocks,other assets, etc.); or (C) Form I-134. Affidavit of Support, completed by a spouse on behalf ofthe applicant and/or children of the applicant or a parent in behalf ofchildren which guarantees complete or partial financial support. Acceptanceof the Affidavit of Support shall be extended to other family members inunusual family circumstances.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Generally, the evidence of employment submitted under paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A)of this section will serve to demonstrate the alien's financial responsibilityduring the documented period(s) of employment. If the alien's period(s)of residence in the United States include significant gaps in employmentor if there is reason to believe that the alien may have received publicassistance while employed, the alien may be required to provide proof thathe or she has not received public cash assistance. An applicant for residencewho is likely to become a public charge will be denied adjustment. (vi) <T3>Burden of proof. </T3>An alien applying for adjustment of status underthis part has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidencethat he or she has resided in the United States for the requisite periods,is admissible to the United States under the provisions of section 245Aof the Act, and is otherwise eligible for adjustment of status under thissection. The inference to be drawn from the documentation provided shalldepend on the extent of the documentation, its credibility and amenabilityto verification. (vii) <T3>Evidence. </T3>The sufficiency of all evidence produced by the applicantwill be judged according to its probative value and credibility. To meethis or her burden of proof, an applicant must provide evidence of eligibilityapart from his or her own testimony. In judging the probative value andcredibility of the evidence submitted, greater weight will be given tothe submission of original documentation. (5) <T3>Filing of application. </T3>(i) The application must be filed on FormI-687 at an office of a designated entity or at a Service office withinthe jurisdiction of the district where the applicant resides. If the applicationis filed with a designated entity, the alien must have consented to havingthe designated entity forward the application to the Service office. Inthe case of applications filed at a Service office, the district directormay, at his or her discretion: (A) Require the applicant to file the application in person; or (B) Require the applicant to file the application by mail; or (C) Permit the filing of applications whether by mail or in person. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The applicant must appear for a personal interview at the Serviceoffice as scheduled.

If the applicant is determined to be ``likely tobecome a public charge,'' he or she may still be admissible under the termsof the Special Rule. (B) In determining whether an alien is ``likely to become a public charge,''financial responsibility of the alien is to be established by examiningthe totality of the alien's circumstances at the time of his or her applicationfor legalization. The existence or absence of a particular factor shouldnever be the sole criterion for determining if an alien is likely to becomea public charge. The determination of financial responsibility should bea prospective evaluation based on the alien's age, health, income and vocation.(C) An alien who has a consistent employment history which shows the abilityto support himself or herself and his or her family, even though his orher income may be below the poverty level, may be admissible under thissection. The alien's employment history need not be continuous in thatit is uninterrupted. It should be continuous in the sense that the alienshall be regularly attached to the workforce, has an income over a substantialperiod of the applicable time, and has demonstrated the capacity to existon his or her income and maintain his or her family without recourse topublic cash assistance. The Special Rule is prospective in that the Serviceshall determine, based on the alien's history, whether he or she is likelyto become a public charge. Past acceptance of public cash assistance withina history of consistent employment will enter into this decision. The weightgiven in considering applicability of the public charge provisions willdepend on many factors, but the length of time an applicant has receivedpublic cash assistance will constitute a significant factor. It is notnecessary to file a waiver in order to apply the Special Rule for Determinationof Public Charge. (v) <T3>Public assistance and criminal history verification. </T3>Declarationsby an applicant that he or she has not been the recipient of public cashassistance and/or has not had a criminal record are subject to a verificationof facts by the Service. The applicant must agree to fully cooperate inthe verification process. Failure to assist the Service in verifying informationnecessary for the adjudication of the application may result in a denialof the application.
