The visit by Perez De Cuellar, who arrived Friday, was thelatest sign that Eastern Europe's last hard-line Communist nationis emerging from its decades-long policy of isolation.   At last week's parliament session, Albanian officials easedrestrictions on travel abroad _ difficult if not impossible fordecades for ordinary Albanians _and abolished the death penalty forthose caught trying to flee the country.   They also said penalties would be lifted for spreading religiousor anti-socialist propaganda.   But these reforms fall far short of the sweeping changes beingintroduced elsewhere in Eastern Europe, where multipartydemocracies are being established.   The Albanian Communist Party continues to exert its control in amanner reminiscent of the repressive Stalinist era of the 1940s and1950s in the Soviet bloc.   Perez De Cuellar, who has attempted to emphasize the positiveaspects of what remains a restrictive society, on Sunday praisedthe cautious changes being introduced in Albania.   ``I am convinced that this process will be further promoted andit will lead the country towards a modern society,'' he said at areception given in his honor by Alia.   Albanian officials have suggested that the changes have beenmade possible by the relaxation off East-West tensions.   Prime Minister Adil Carcani touched on that theme at a meetingSaturday with Perez de Cuellar, who is the first U.N.secretary-general to visit Albania.   ``In the future too, the Albanian government will make otherchanges in accordance with the conditions of the country'sdevelopment and with the international circumstances,'' ATA quotedCarcani as saying.</TEXT></DOC>
