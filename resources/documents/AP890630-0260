The University of Utah and GE announced Wednesday that theirscientists will collaborate in attempts to verify and explain thewidely disputed findings announced in March by university chemist B.Stanley Pons and British colleague Martin Fleischmann.   The collaboration is the first such agreement the university hasmade with a major corporation, but doesn't rule out similararrangements with other companies, said James Brophy, the school'svice president for research.   Pons and Fleischmann maintain they were able in a tabletopexperiment to produce more than 100 times the energy needed toproduce it.   Some researchers at other laboratories have duplicated parts ofthe experiment, but Ames Laboratory officials said in Ames, Iowa,that they had been unable to produce results similar to thoseclaimed by Pons and Fleischmann.   ``I wish I could tell you otherwise,'' Tom Barton, a professor ofchemistry at Iowa State University and director of the federallaboratory, said. ``I was just as excited as everybody else when therevelations were made.   ``I thought our energy crisis was over,'' he said.   ``We explored (the findings) to the limits of our equipment andexpertise,'' he said Wednesday. ``I'm sorry to say we detectednothing. It would have been exciting.''   Ames Laboratory physicist Joseph Shinar said scientists are nolonger thinking of cold fusion as a source of energy. But he saidacademics will continue looking into the matter.   At the Utah Capitol on Thursday, the state fusion advisorycouncil met privately to hear progress reports from Utah and Texasscientists. The council was created to decide whether and how tospend $5 million set aside by the Legislature to fund fusionresearch.   Randy Moon, state science adviser and a member of the council,said members were ``very encouraged and very upbeat'' about thepresentations, but he wouldn't elaborate.</TEXT></DOC>
