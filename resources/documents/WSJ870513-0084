But traders and many economists still fret that the market's recent slump will continue in the weeks ahead.    &quot;This is still a very nervous market,&quot; says David F. DeLucia, a partner at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;On balance, the bears still have the favor,&quot; adds Mitchell Shivers, chief executive of Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc.    Nevertheless, prices of actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds rallied about a point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount, erasing half of Monday's huge losses. Traders cited a 2.53-point decline in the Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index of 26 raw material prices to 232.88. On Monday, the index posted one of its largest single-day advances ever.    In recent trading sessions, the credit markets have closely tracked movements in the commodity index as an indication of the inflation outlook. &quot;The momentum has been decidedly bearish for the markets so far and is likely to remain that way for awhile,&quot; said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    Corporate and municipal bond prices also gained yesterday, although much less than Treasury issues. &quot;The market still lacks liquidity, with many traders and investors unable to find firm price levels for many corporate and municipal securities,&quot; said Mr. DeLucia, a partner in charge of corporate bond syndication and secondary market trading.    One big influence on the credit markets could be tomorrow's Commerce Department report on the nation's merchandise trade deficit. The March figure is expected to show a smaller gap than in February. According to the average estimate of 14 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the trade deficit shrank to $13.6 billion in March from $15.1 billion the previous month. Individual guesses ranged from $11.8 billion to $15.5 billion.    &quot;I do think the trade situation is turning for the better,&quot; said Mr. Sinai. He expects a merchandise trade deficit of $12.8 billion, which he contends &quot;would rally the dollar against other major currencies and bolster the bond market.&quot;    Even so, he and others agree the Federal Reserve may have to take bolder steps to shore up the dollar and soothe growing uneasiness about inflation. The Fed's recent slight credit-tightening move &quot;isn't going to be enough&quot; to convince investors that the dollar and inflation will remain under control, says Roger A. Froehlich, president of Technical Dimensions, a Mount Kisco, N.Y., bond market forecasting service.    The Fed maneuver wasn't &quot;a convincing approach,&quot; Mr. Froehlich said. &quot;It is a gradualist approach to a very severe problem.&quot; He argued that gradualism &quot;has never worked in the past. It may have bought a little time, but that's about all.&quot; He contends that long-term Treasury bond yields are likely to hover between 8 1/2% and 8 3/4% &quot;over the short term,&quot; but that rallies &quot;will attract selling&quot; and that yields &quot;are heading toward 9.2%&quot; within the next three to six months.    &quot;The main driving force&quot; in yesterday's bond rally was the drop in the CRB index, said Keith B. Jarrett, chief economist of Technical Data Corp., a Boston financial advisory firm. He expects further bond rallies in the short term, assuming that the trade deficit to be announced tomorrow is about $13 billion or lower. But in the next four to six months, he expects the dollar to drop further and long-term Treasury bond yields to surge to 9 1/2% to 10%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers rose 6.26 points to 1284.70. That followed Monday's sharp drop of more than 20 points. The index ranged between 1272.85 and 1289.40.    The Treasury's new 8 3/4% bonds due 2017 rose to 100 21/32 from 99 21/32 Monday. The yield declined to 8.69% from 8.78% Monday, leaving it below the average of 8.76% at the Treasury's auction last Thursday.    The government's new 8 1/2% notes due 1997 rose to 99 29/32 from 99 10/32 Monday, while the yield fell to 8.51% from 8.6%. That was slightly below the average annual yield of 8.52% at last Wednesday's Treasury auction.    Among short-term interest rates, the federal funds rate averaged 6.77%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That was slightly lower than Monday's average of 6.84% on funds, the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight.    Rates on Treasury bills rose from their average levels at Monday's regular weekly auction. The rate on the latest three-month Treasury bills rose to 5.59% bid from an average of 5.47% Monday, while the rate on the latest six-month bills climbed to 5.84% bid from 5.74% Monday.    In the municipal bond market yesterday, an issue of about $136.5 million of Louisiana general obligation bonds got off to a brisk sales start. As of yesterday afternoon, the unsold balance among the underwriting group totaled about $65 million.    The issue was priced after auction to yield from 5.5% on bonds due 1988 to 8.1% on bonds due 2003, according to Salomon Brothers Inc., which headed the underwriting group. Bonds due 2004-2007 were not reoffered. The issue is rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and single-A-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Separately, a proposed offering of about $460.9 million of refunding revenue bonds by the New York State Medical Care Facilities Finance Agency for Presbyterian Hospital was tentatively priced yesterday by underwriters led by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. Under the proposed scale, yields would range from 5.5% on bonds due 1990 to about 8.04% on bonds due 2025.    In the corporate new-issue market, a $150 million issue of Combustion Engineering Inc. subordinated notes was offered to investors through an underwriting group led by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. The 9.7% notes, which are due May 15, 1997, were priced at par. The issue is rated single-A-3 by Moody's and single-A-minus by Sandamp;P. </TEXT></DOC>
