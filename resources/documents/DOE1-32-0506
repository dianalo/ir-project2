Examines this phenomenon with particularregard to the appearance of gas using the results of observations inmines belonging to the Donbassantratsit and Krasno-armeiskugol' associations.Here, the method of mining consisted of commencing one face when theprevious face was worked out - usually methane emissions increased atthe point of changeover. It was found that when the roof was caved in,large amounts of methane occurred in workings adjacent to a worked outface. When this occurred, used ventilation holes which had been disconnectedwere reconnected to the gas pipe. The investigation showed that activationof displacement of rock influenced by underlying workings often resultsin an increased level of gas emissions from worked out areas and thismust be taken into account when planning the layout of ventilation anddegassing systems. Discusses use of ventilation holes and recognizesthe advantages of degassing the worked out area as well as the area beingworked. Graph demonstrates how the nature of methane occurrence dependsupon the direction of the ventilation current in a face adjacent to aworked out face and the distance to the active face. 3 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
