(See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, and final rule relatednotice published at 48 FR 29114, June 24, 1983.)This notice imposes no new reporting or recordkeeping provisions that aresubject to Office of Management and Budget review in accordance with thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). This action is not arule as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) andthus is exempt from the provisions of that Act. <ITAG tagnum="85">National Average Minimum Value of Donated Foods for the Period July1, 1989 Through June 30, 1990</ITAG>This notice implements mandatory provisions of sections 6(e), 14(f) and17(h) of the National School Lunch Act (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 1755(e), 1762a(f),and 1766(h)). Section 6(e) of the Act establishes the national averagevalue of donated food assistance to be given to States for each lunch servedin NSLP at 11.00 cents per meal. This amount is subject to annual adjustmentsas of July 1 of each year to reflect changes in the Price Index for FoodUsed in Schools and Institutions. Section 17(h) of the Act provides thatthe same value of assistance in donated foods for school lunches shallalso be established for lunches and suppers served in the Child Care FoodProgram. Notice is hereby given that the national average minimum valueof donated foods, or cash in lieu thereof, per lunch under NSLP (7 CFRpart 210) and per lunch and supper under the Child Care Food Program (7CFR part 226) shall be 13.25 cents for the period July 1, 1989 throughJune 30, 1990. The Price Index for Food Used in Schools and Institutions is computed onthe basis of five major food components in the Bureau of Labor Statistics'Producer Price Index (cereal and bakery products; meats, poultry and fish;dairy products; processed fruits and vegetables; and fats and oil). Eachcomponent is weighted using the same relative weight as determined by theBureau of Labor Statistics. The value of food assistance is adjusted eachJuly 1 by the annual percentage change in a three-month simple averagevalue of this Price Index for March, April and May. The three-month averageof the Price Index increased by 6.5 percent from 108.54 for March, Apriland May of 1988 to 115.56 for the same three-months in 1989. When computedon the basis of unrounded data and rounded to the nearest one-quarter cent,the resulting national average for the period July 1, 1989 through June30, 1990 will be 13.25 cents per meal. This constitutes a one cent perlunch increase over the rate in effect for the 1989 school year. Section 14(f) of the Act provides that commodity schools shall be eligibleto receive donated foods equal in value to the sum of the national averagevalue of donated foods established under section 6(e) of the Act and thenational average payment established under section 4 of the Act. Such schoolsare eligible to receive up to 5 cents of this value in cash for processingand handling expenses related to the use of such foods. Commodity schools are defined in section 12(d)(7) of the Act as ``schoolsthat do not participate in the school lunch program under this Act, butwhich receive commodities made available by the Secretary for use by suchschools in nonprofit lunch programs.''For the 1990 school yer, commodity schools shall be eligible to receivedonated-food assistance valued at 28.00 cents for each lunch served. Thisamount is based on the sum of the section 6(e) level of assistance announcedin this notice and the adjusted section 4 minimum national average paymentfactor for school year 1990. The section 4 factor for commodity schoolsdoes not include the two cents per lunch increase for schools where 60percent of the lunches were served in the second preceding year free orat reduced prices, since that increase is applicable only to schools participatingin the National School Lunch Program. <ITAG tagnum="85">Cash in Lieu Payments_Value of Donated Commodities for School Year1988-89</ITAG>Section 6(b) of the Act, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 1755(b)) and the regulationsgoverning cash in lieu of donated foods (7 CFR part 240) require the Secretaryof Agriculture by June 1 of each school year to estimate the value of agriculturalcommodities and other foods that will be delivered to States during thatschool year. Under the food distribution regulations (7 CFR part 250),these foods are used by schools participating in NSLP. If the estimatedvalue is less than the total level of commodity assistance authorized undersection 6(e) of the Act, the Secretary is required by July 1 of that schoolyear to pay to each State educational agency funds equal to the differencebetween the value of programmed deliveries and the total level of authorizedassistance for each State. During the past school year the adjusted minimum national average valueof donated foods or payments of cash in lieu thereof per lunch was 12.25cents. In accordance with section 6(e) of the Act, the mandated level of commodityassistance was $487,305,456 for school year 1989. The Secretary has determinedthat at least that amount was available for delivery nationally by June30, 1989 to meet the mandated level of assistance. Notice is hereby given, therefore, that no shortfall cash payments willbe made for the school year ending June 30, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 8, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">George A.
