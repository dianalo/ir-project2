But analysts and industry experts have expressed skepticism thatthe meetings would produce a substantive accord leading to immediateor long-lasting output restraints.   Doubts grew when ministers adjourned after an hour saying theywould hold separate talks on Friday and possibly reconvene again onSaturday.   Eight ministers from OPEC's price and strategy committees werefaced with the tough problem of designing a new production agreementthat would allot quotas under a formula acceptable to all members.   The committees' recommendations are to be presented to a fullmeeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries whenoil ministers from all 13 nations gather on Monday.   Indonesian Energy Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita told reportershe was optimistic the ministers would succeed in their task.   Ginandjar, who recently visited some of the other cartelcountries, said, ``Everybody ... expressed their concern for thelevel of prices,'' which have hurt their economies.   He said he was hopeful that ``all parties will do their best toreach a solution,'' adding: ``There is ground for negotiation andfor eventual agreement.''   But he acknowledged the going would not be easy. ``We have towork very hard,'' he said.   Industry experts, however, have said they doubt the meetings willproduce results this time around.   ``OPEC remains in disarray and the likelihood of market stabilityat reasonable oil price levels appears less promising today than itdid a year ago,'' Richard M. Morrow, chairman of the AmericanPetroleum Institute, told a gathering of analyts and experts thisweek.   Morrow said that even if OPEC reaches an agreement on new quotas,the industry is skeptical it ``will last for more than a few months_ if that long.''   Adding to the skepticism were reports this week that some seniorOPEC officials were already looking beyond the current talks topossible meetings next year to resolve the quota dispute betweenIran and Iraq, which is considered the main stumbling block to anaccord.   A key problem facing the ministers is bringing Iraq back into thequota system.   OPEC set production ceilings based on a December 1986 arrangementlimiting total output at about 15 million barrels a day. Thatexcludes Iraq, which has ignored its quota because it was not givenparity with Iran, its foe in an eight-year war that ended with acease-fire in August.   Analysts say most of the cartel members have exceeded theirquotas in recent months, adding to the glut in the world market.   Prices have fallen to $4 or more below the cartel's benchmarkprice of $18 per 42-gallon barrel.   The International Energy Agency estimated in its Monthly OilMarket Report that the cartel's production jumped to almost 21.1million barrels a day in October, the highest monthly output in morethan five years.   Analysts differ on the amount that OPEC would have to reduce itsoutput to eliminate the excess and boost oil prices, with opinionsranging from 2 million to 4 million barrels a day.   Iraq, in refusing its quota of 1.5 million barrels a day, said itwanted to have the same ceiling of 2.4 million barrels as Iran.Since the cease-fire went into effect, negotiations have been underway to bring Iraq back into the quota system.   Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi told reportersbefore the closed-door meeting began Thursday: ``It's very clear ourposition hasn't changed.''   Iran had proposed that its quota reflect a higher domestic demandof some 1 million barrels a day. Iraqi internal demand is estimatedat 300,000 barrels a day, the source said.   Analysts estimate Iraq has been producing at least 2.6 millionbarrels a day, an amount that could hit 3.7 million barrels nextyear with completion of a new pipeline through Saudi Arabia to theRed Sea.</TEXT></DOC>
