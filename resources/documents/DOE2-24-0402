In this invention, each of stator vanes, which are installedside by side, of a steam turbine operating in the wet steam is composedof the vane material on which magnetic poles are installed, an electromagneticforce is generated in a passage between the above stator vanes by implyinga magnetic field to the above magnetic poles. The flow of a water filmon the surface of the stator vane is controlled by the interference betweenthe above electromagnetic force and the fluid force in the wet streamand erosion of the turbine blades is prevented. An application exampleof this invention is as follows: Upon implying the above magnetic field,an induced starting force genarated in the flow field is detected, andfrom its output, thickness and an amount of a water film are obtained.These data are sent to a blade erosion level evaluator in order to evaluatethe blade erosion level. When the evaluation result does not fall intowithin the reference value, the amount of the water film is controlledby adjusting and setting the implying magnetic flux with an implyingmagnetic flux density adjustor.
