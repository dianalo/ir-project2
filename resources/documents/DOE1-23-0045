The CQC technique is compared to other mode combinationtechniques, such as absolute summation, SRSS and the 10 percent (groupingmethod) rules in R.G. 1.92, as well as the time history technique. TheCQC technique compares very closely with the time history technique.The R.G. 1.92 technique results in over 100 percent excess conservatism.The CQC technique is recommended as an acceptable alternative to R.G.1.92 techniques.</TEXT></DOC>
