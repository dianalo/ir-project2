The class idealises, within the uncertainty of the one-speedmodel, a variety of practical situations such as U-D/sub 2/O-C-Zr-Pbor Pu-U-Na-Fe symmetric reactor assemblies; which may possibly containa symmetrically anisotropic neutron source. A closed form double seriessolution, which turns out to be quite convenient for design and optimisationpurposes, has been obtained, in terms of discontinuous functions forthe multi-regional angular flux by application of a double finite Legendretransform. Disadvantage factor evaluations for a U-C lattice cell resultingfrom a low-order P/sub 0/P/sub 1/ approximation of this method are foundto be in full agreement with hybrid diffusion-transport estimates.</TEXT></DOC>
