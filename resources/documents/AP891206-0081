ETS spokesman Ray Nicosia said it was uncertain if the cheatingannounced Wednesday was the largest-scale breach of standardizedtest security ever. But such cases have rarely extended beyond asingle class, school or test center.   Nicosia said ETS, based in Princeton, N.J., had received about50 letters from Indian students and test center supervisorsindicating that students had been able to buy copies of thestandardized tests before the administration dates.   ETS said it had learned that test materials had been improperlyobtained in advance by students for the Oct. 28 Test of English asa Foreign Language. This prompted cancellation of exams at fivecenters in the Bangalore area, affecting 620 students, according toETS.   The language exam, taken annually by 500,000 students worldwide,including 21,500 Indian students, is designed to evaluate Englishproficiency in students whose native language is not English. It isused for admission by 3,000 North American colleges anduniversities.   An investigation also found students were able to buy copies ofthe Graduate Record Examination before taking last month's test.   The test is taken primarily by college students to entergraduate school. Most of the approximately 14,000 Indian studentswho take the GRE each year are trying to gain admittance to U.S.graduate schools.   ETS, which administers standardized tests in 170 countries, saidit had canceled the scores of 2,744 of 4,280 test takers for theGRE administered Oct. 14 at 17 of 27 Indian test centers.   It said it was rescheduling the Dec. 9 GRE in India to nextmonth.   An estimated 366,000 students worldwide take the GRE each year,according to ETS.</TEXT></DOC>
