They were evaluated clinico-radiologically.The diagnosis of this syndrome was made by computerized tomography. Theinfarcted lesions of each patient were widely distributed in many areasamong the thalamus, midbrain, pons, cerebellum, and occipital lobe. Boththe thalami were involved in 8 patients. When the thalamus was involvedbilaterally, the low density areas of both the thalami were demonstratedto be almost the same in size and symmetric in localization by computerizedtomography, showing a characteristic pattern. Further, magnetic resonanceimaging could reveal small lesions in the brain stem minutely. Angiographyrevealed that stenosis or occlusion was within the circle of 2 cm indiameter surrounding the five-forked road of the top of the basilar arteryin 84.6 %. Recanalization of the occluded artery occurred in 61.5 %,which suggests that the embolism plays an important role in appearanceof this syndrome. In spite of frequent recanalization hemorrhagic infarctionnever occurred. The prognosis was very poor.</TEXT></DOC>
