McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Housing starts bounced back 12 percent inOctober from September's seven-year low, the government reportedFriday, and analsyts said they expect the construction rate toremain stable through the first quarter of 1990.   ``The housing market seems to have bottomed out,'' said DavidSeiders, chief economist for the National Association of HomeBuilders. But he and other analysts said they do not foresee anysurge in building _ ``just hanging in there.''   The Commerce Department reported that new homes and apartmentswere built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.42 millionunits last month.   The 12 percent rebound from September was the sharpest gainsince a 13 percent advance in December 1986. Starts had fallen 4.6percent in September and 6.4 percent in August.   Although September's pace was revised up from the 1.26 millionreported earlier, it still was the most sluggish since new homesand apartments were built at an annual rate of 1.17 million unitsin October 1982 during the depths of the 1981-82 recession.   Many analysts attributed the September construction drop to aspike in mortgage rates and said the October advance followed asubsequent decline.   The housing industry has been among the hardest hit as theFederal Reserve drove up interest rates to slow economic growth andlower inflation.   But the Fed has slowly eased rates over the summer and, exceptfor the blip in September, mortgage rates have fallen from March's11.22 percent peak to 9.82 percent by the end of October, accordingto surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.   The higher rates stifled sales and boosted inventories ofsingle-family homes to an 8.1-month supply by last March, saidRichard Peach, an economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association.As rates have fallen, he said, inventories have dropped to a6-month supply, which ``by historical standards ... are in goodshape.''   But even though many analysts expect mortgage rates to dropanother half of a percentage point in coming months, Peach said hedoes not expect a major surge in building.   Construction of single-family homes in October rose 6.9 percentto an annual rate of 1.03 million units. Single-family starts hadfallen 3 percent in September and 3.5 percent in August.   Apartment construction rose 28 percent in October to an annualrate of 393,000 units. It had fallen 9.4 percent in September afterdropping 14 percent in August.   Total housing starts during the first 10 months of the year weredown 6 percent from the same period of 1988.   The South, which posted a 14.7 drop for the steepest regionaldecline in September, turned in the sharpest increase in October,up 17.1 percent to 562,000 units. It was followed by the Midwestwith a 16.5 percent gain to 289,000 units.   Construction rose 6 percent in the Northeast to 176,000 unitsand 5.1 percent in the West to 393,000 units.</TEXT></DOC>
