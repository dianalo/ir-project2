Gerard C. Smith, the former negotiator, and Spurgeon Keeny Jr.,head of the arms control group, leveled the accusations Friday asPresident Reagan weighed conflicting opinions from his senioradvisers on what to do.   The U.S. military joint chiefs of staff urged him to hold to thetreaty while William F. Burns Jr., head of the U.S. Arms Controland Disarmament Agency, recommended that he charge Moscow with a``material breach'' of the treaty.   The Reagan administration, meanwhile, is awaiting a responsefrom Moscow on a date for a five-year review of the ABM treaty,considered a cornerstone of the arms control process.   At issue is the Soviet phased array radar station at Krasnoyarskthat Reagan has already labeled a violation of the 1972 treaty intwo reports to Congress. While the Soviets deny any infraction,even many liberal critics of the administration's arm controlpolicy question the legality of the facility.   The treaty limits U.S. and Soviet defenses against ballisticmissiles and stands in the way of Reagan's quest for a space-baseddefense against Soviet rockets.   Keeny said that although the Soviet installation ``isinconsistent with the ABM treaty's provisions, labeling Krasnoyarskas a material breach would be a gross exaggeration of its militaryand legal significance and clearly is designed as a last-gaspeffort to kill the ABM treaty in the waning days of theadministration rather than solve the problem.''   Former negotiator Smith said ``having been blocked by Congressfrom killing the treaty through reinterpretation, it appears theadministration is trying to find another way to kill the treaty.''   A U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity told TheAssociated Press that even if Reagan accepted the advice of Burnsand other hard liners, it did not mean he would abandon the treaty.   The chiefs recommended that Reagan not charge the Soviets with amaterial breach because that could lead to an unraveling of thetreaty, the official said. ``The chiefs are convinced if thathappens the Soviets are in a better position to take advantage of abreakout,'' the official said.   This puts the chiefs at odds with Burns, who takes a harderstance on the treaty than the military but would give the Sovietstime to level the facilities before the United States retaliated.   Reagan is not likely to make a decision until a date for reviewis set with the Soviets. ``We're still working on it,'' theofficial said.   Reagan's senior advisers discussed the issue at an unpublicizedmeeting last week of the National Security Planning Group and didnot reach a consensus.   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, declined on Mondayto discuss the options presented to Reagan. ``No decision has beenmade,'' the spokesman said. ``The issue is under review.''   Fitzwater said ``there are sound and valid arguments on bothsides of the question'' and that Reagan would make a decision``before the review.''   The treaty constrains defenses against ballistic missiles on thetheory a potential aggressor might hold back if his country facedretaliatory devastation.   The treaty limits how fast and far the United States can go inits search for a space-based defense against ballistic missilesthat uses such sophisticated technology as laser beams and kineticenergy.   The program, known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative,is being carried out under what the Reagan administration describesas a ``strict interpretation'' of the 1972 treaty. A broaderinterpretation would provide more leeway, while scrapping thetreaty would remove all legal restraints.</TEXT></DOC>
