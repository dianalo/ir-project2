Hundreds of government officials, diplomats, journalists andconservationists watched Tuesday as Moi put a torch to the 12 tonsivory atop a 20-foot pile of wood.   The pyre was placed on a hill in Nairobi National Parkoverlooking the vast Athi Plains that are home to gazelle, rhino,giraffe, zebra, lions and other wild animals.   ``Actions speak louder than words,'' Moi said. ``Kenya cannotappeal to the world to stop buying ivory if at the same time we areselling the very same commodity.''   Conservationists and many nations have called for a worldwide banon the ivory trade.   Kenya's elephant population has fallen from 65,000 in the l970sto about l7,000. In all of Africa, poaching has cut the elephantpopulation from an estimated 1.5 million in the 1970s to fewer than700,000 today.   Iain Douglas-Hamilton, an elephant expert, said the burn was``immensely important'' and he hoped it would help make people inivory consuming nations aware that if they ``buy, wear or sellivory, they're helping kill elephants.''   Moi said he also will destroy 270 rhino horns Kenya confiscatedfrom poachers, but did not say when.   Despite a rhino horn trading ban, Africa's rhino population hasdwindled from 65,000 in the early 1970s to an estimated 4,000.   Conservationists say the ban has failed because the horn is stillhighly prized in the Far East, where it is sold in powdered form asan aphrodisiac.   Moi said his government will continue to destroy all ivoryconfiscated within its borders.   ``I hope our action will help persuade others to appreciate theurgent need to take drastic steps to halt the wanton slaughter ofelephants by declining to trade in ivory and its products bothwithin Africa and beyond,'' Moi said.   The ivory burned Tuesday represented four years' worth of tusksconfiscated from poachers.   More than 600 gallons of gasoline fueled the fire, since ivoryonly burns under intense heat. The top half of the pyre wasblackened after about an hour.   Richard Leakey, Kenya's director of wildlife, said the governmenthas increased the number of game patrols and he said poaching hasfallen drastically in the past two months.   About 300 elephants were killed in the first five months of 1989.   Ivory fetches $109 to $154 a pound on the world market, with thehigher prices going for the increasingly rare larger tusks. Anaverage tusk weighs nearly 11 pounds, down from nearly 22 pounds adecade ago.   Kenya has joined a growing list of countries that support aworldwide ban on the ivory trade. Conservationists say the ban wouldlikely work because the elephant tusk is used only for decorativepurposes.   The EEC, Japan and the United States buy up to 75 percent ofivory on world markets. But in June, the United States, Japan, the12-nation European Economic Community, Switzerland and Canadaimposed bans on ivory imports.   The Lausanne, Switzerland-based 102-nation Convention onInternational Trade in Endangered Species will meet in October toconsider a worldwide ban.   Zimbabwe, South Africa and Botswana oppose the ban. They say theyhave successfully protected their elephants while herds in otherAfrican nations have declined.</TEXT></DOC>
