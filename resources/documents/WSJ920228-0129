He wasphotographed in a golf cart tooling around Shenzhen, China'sprosperous special economic zone colonized by Hong Kong. Mr.Deng's appearance in the booming free-trade zone was widelyinterpreted as an indication that the economic reformers havebeaten out the central planners for control of the CommunistParty.   &quot;If capitalism has something good, then socialism shouldbring it over and use it,&quot; Mr. Deng was quoted as saying.</LP><TEXT>   The tea leaves spelled out &quot;capitalism&quot; again this week,in articles in the People's Daily, the official CommunistParty newspaper. The stories, believed to have beenorchestrated by Mr. Deng, indicate that the centralgovernment in Beijing plans to hasten economic reform byusing capitalism &quot;correctly.&quot; A page-one article in Sunday'sedition allowed that &quot;making use of capitalism to develop theeconomy of China is a beneficial supplement to the socialisteconomy.&quot; Among those elements of capitalism identified as&quot;good&quot; are stock markets, contracts and mergers.   Mr. Deng's newly professed faith in the market won't comeas any surprise to China's coastal provinces, which long agolearned that capitalism isn't a dirty word. Far from Beijing,provinces like Guangdong and Fujian have never stoppedexperimenting with market reform. The results have beenspectacular. Guangdong, which borders Hong Kong, has one ofthe world's fastest-growing economies, with a real growthrate averaging 12.5% a year throughout the 1980s.   China's leadership has been badly shaken by the collapseof communism up north, and Mr. Deng's paeans to capitalismare in large part born of desperation. By stepping upeconomic reform, he hopes to stave off political reform andretain the Communist Party's control of 1.1 billion Chinese.It is crucial to note that Mr. Deng has given no indicationthat he intends to let up politically. The reality is theopposite. The dissidents who survived Tiananmen Square remainin jail, where they were sent after secret trials; some ofthem have yet to be tried. Any murmur of dissent continues tobe savagely repressed.   While we still don't have a general theory of howtotalitarian regimes die, one thing is clear: Once people geta taste of economic freedom, they want political and socialfreedoms, too. Just look at the other China. Taiwan, whichnot long ago was a dictatorship with an economy heavilycontrolled from the center, is now moving quickly toward bothdemocracy and a more open economy. Its transformation hasbeen so successful that Russia, Ukraine and Latvia are eagerto learn from the Taiwan experience.   Mr. Deng's homilies about capitalism in the service ofsocialism sound similar to those professed in anothernewspaper Monday. &quot;The idea of socialism lives on. . .,&quot; apundit wrote. . . . &quot;we can no longer set capitalism andsocialism against each other, as if we were living in the ageof religious wars.&quot; The pundit behind these words is the NewYork Times's newly announced occasional columnist, oneMikhail S. Gorbachev. No one knows better than Deng Xiaopingwhat happened to him and his country. Someday, perhaps, itwill be China's turn.</TEXT></DOC>
