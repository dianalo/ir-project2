The request stems from an investigation into reports that testdocuments on the fasteners were falsified at a laboratory of theFairchild Industries subsidiary in Chatsworth, Calif., near LosAngeles, Mitch Barker of the Federal Aviation Administration saidTuesday.   A day earlier, in discussing a weekend search of the plant, U.S.Attorney Gene S. Anderson and others said no crashes had been linkedto the disputed parts, which investigators said were listed asapproved by a phantom ``Inspector 11.''   Discovery of untested parts on aircraft could result in fines forthe manufacturer, Barker said.   ``It's certainly a safety concern,'' he said. ``It's a concern tothe U.S. attorney's office, and it's a concern to us.''   He said FAA staff in district offices had been told to work withmanufacturers to determine whether the fasteners were shipped andwhether they were used by the European consortium Airbus Industrie.   Airlines are not being required to check their planes, Barkersaid.   ``The manufacturers will be checking and reporting back to us,''he explained. ``They are held accountable for the parts that go intotheir aircraft.''   Fairchild's annual report said the fasteners are used on almostevery military and commercial aircraft.   Jack Gamble of Boeing said records of Voi-Shan shipments andparts use and distribution would be checked by company and FAAofficials, after which ``the FAA will make a determiniation aboutwhat needs to be done.''</TEXT></DOC>
