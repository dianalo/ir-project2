Health and Human Services Secretary Otis Bowen yesterday presented his plan to President Reagan and a cabinet group, and received a generally favorable response, White House officials said.    Conservatives have attacked the idea of federally financed catastrophic health insurance as inconsistent with the White House's free-market agenda. But it seemed clear at yesterday's meeting that &quot;everyone agrees we should have some kind of catastrophic plan,&quot; one official said.    What isn't clear, though, is what shape the administration's proposal will take. Officials said the cabinet members debated whether the plan should be mandatory and how much it should rely on participation by private health insurers. Another point of debate is whether the plan should apply only to the elderly or to all citizens.    According to officials, Dr. Bowen cited a letter of support for his plan that he had received from the wife of James Brady, the president's press secretary, who was badly wounded in the 1981 attempt to assassinate Mr. Reagan. And Labor Secretary William Brock recounted the huge cost his son incurred caring for a premature baby.    White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan then asked department heads how many of them were covered for catastrophic illness, &quot;and half said yes; half said no -- even though all had the same plan,&quot; one official said. Accordingly, the cabinet group and the president decided they need more information before making decisions. </TEXT></DOC>
