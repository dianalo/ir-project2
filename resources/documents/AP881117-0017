Gary Leshaw, director of the non-profit Atlanta legal aidorganization representing Mariel detainees, said he was informed bythe Justice Department that there would be an announcement Thursdayon the prisoners.   Meanwhile, prisoner advocate groups in Miami and Atlanta plan toask federal judges to stop the deportations, which if carried outwould mark the first time Cubans have been deported to theircommunist homeland since May 1985, The Miami Herald reported.   ``There is a chance if we all speak with one united voice hereand explain the merits of our case,'' said Rafael Penalver, chairmanof the Task Force of Cuban American Citizen Organizations.   Penalver is a lawyer who helped negotiate the settlement to endriots by 3,800 Mariel detainees in Oakdale, La., and at an Atlantaprison last November. ``We will appeal to President Reagan. He canblock the deportations, even if the people are sitting in anairplane at the airport.''   A special three-member Justice Department panel was created inthe aftermath of the riots to review the cases of 113 Marieldetainees in federal prison in Talladega, Ala. In the past twomonths, the panel has looked at prison records, immigration history,written statements from the prisoners and other materials, but therehave been no personal appearances by the prisoners or their lawyers.   Deportations to Cuba were reinstated as part of a renewedimmigration pact between the United States and Cuba that allows upto 20,000 Cubans and 3,000 political prisoners and their families toemigrate and, in return, the Cuban government will take back 2,500prisoners.   The Justice Department contends that these prisoners arecriminals the Cuban regime injected into a boatlift of refugees fromthe port of Mariel.   Prisoners selected for deportation are being taken from a list ofMariel inmates who were imprisoned at the time of the 1984immigration pact.   Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman of the Cuban-American NationalFoundation, acknowledges there is much division over thedeporations, even in Dade County's Cuban exile community.   He said the foundation favors letting Cubans apply for visas toimmigrate to the United States but opposes the deportations to Cuba.   ``I cannot in one hand denounce the human rights situation inCuba and then support sending them back,'' Mas said.</TEXT></DOC>
