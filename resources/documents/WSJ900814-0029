Prices of some corn futures contracts tumbled to theirlowest levels since February as good growing weather in theMidwest continued to improve the prospects for aneight-billion bushel corn harvest this fall.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It was a big down day,&quot; said Victor Lespinasse, anassistant vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago.   In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the wheatcontract for September delivery fell to a new low of $2.7375a bushel before settling the day at $2.7525 a bushel, down5.25 cents.   The price of the September wheat contract has fallen about30% over the past year amid the combination of forecasts fora big harvest in the U.S. this year as well as slumpingdemand from the Soviet Union.   The Agriculture Department reported last week that theU.S. wheat harvest should increase 33% from last year's crop,which was damaged by drought.   At the same time, good growing weather in the Soviet Unionis increasing crop prospects there, and cutting its need forU.S. wheat.   According to Daniel W. Basse, director of market researchat AgResource Co., Chicago, the pace of U.S. wheat exportshas dropped 32% since June 30, compared with the year-earlierperiod.   Because of the Soviet crop prospects, most analysts expectthe Soviet Union to reduce its grain imports from all sourcesby roughly 20% through next June. It isn't clear how U.S.trade will be affected; however, the U.S. is one of thelargest shippers of grain to the Soviet Union.   Crop prices were also depressed yesterday by reports thatthe Soviet Union's plan to sell roughly $5 billion indiamonds is running into internal opposition. U.S. graintraders had been speculating that the cash-strapped SovietUnion would use some of the proceeds from any diamond salesto buy U.S. crops.   In July, the Soviet Union agreed to sell diamonds to theSwiss branch of De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. and toborrow $1 billion from the company.   According to traders, the Russian Federation is apparentlyopposing the move by the central government. It isn't clearwhether that will block the pact, but the Russian republic isa source of Soviet diamonds.   U.S. grain exports also seem to be slipping at leasttemporarily under the weight of higher fuel costs, whichincreases shipping costs, traders said.   After the close of trading yesterday, the weekly cropcondition reports by Midwest states indicated that the corncrop is maturing slowly. The unusually wet spring delayed theplanting season.   However, the crop generally is in good shape even thoughrainfall in some states such as Iowa has been the heaviest in118 years.   In that state, 91% of the corn crop is in excellent orgood condition, compared with 89% a week earlier. While therainfall has washed out some fields, it has helped restoresubsoil moisture that was exhausted during the 1988 drought.   Soybean prices dropped yesterday in the wake of beneficialrains in the Mississippi Delta region, where conditions havebeen dry.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Persian Gulf activities again overshadowed allother factors in influencing petroleum prices and futurestrading yesterday. Spot prices for North Sea crudes were 35cents to 55 cents a barrel higher. September crude on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange was 54 cents higher, at $26.77 abarrel, when trading was halted because of a power outage inlower Manhattan. Prices were bolstered by reports that anIraqi pipeline across Saudi Arabia was closed and an Iraqitanker had been turned away from a Saudi terminal.   But events outside the Middle East helped buoy prices, aswell. For the fourth time in 11 days, North Sea oil workersstopped work in a bid for union recognition and better safetyrules. News reports said some 7,000 workers walked out in the24-hour wildcat strike, but added that the companies involvedput the number much lower and said production wasn't beingaffected. Separately, the Houston Ship Channel was hit by yetanother oil spill. A barge buckled, spilling 20,000 gallonsof heating oil into the channel, according to Coast Guardofficials. The waterway was obstructed, but not closed.                                                                                                          NEW YORK MARKETS: A major power failure struck New YorkCity's downtown financial district early yesterday afternoon,shutting down electricity and disrupting communications.   A spokeswoman at the Commodity Exchange, which is in theWorld Trade Center, said the clocks on the exchange froze at1:13 p.m. EDT and trading was suspended shortly afterward.   &quot;There are no closing or settling prices because theexchange floor is pitch dark and the prices on the boards onthe wall aren't visible,&quot; the spokeswoman said. The CommodityExchange is part of a five-exchange complex housed in theCommodity Exchange Center. All the exchanges share the sametrading floor.   At around 2 p.m., the personnel of the exchanges wereevacuated and sent home.   Precious metals, with trading spurred by the volatileMiddle Eastern situation, were strong at the time of theirsuspension. The August gold contract, which will ceasetrading Aug. 29, was up $8.30 an ounce based on the lastposted trade, at $405.20. The most-active September contractadvanced $8.10 to $414.00. September silver surged, outdoingeven gold as it last traded at $5.1520 an ounce, for a gainof 16.10 cents. October platinum rose $9.70 an ounce to$506.00.   James Kneafsey, president of Cambridge FinancialManagement Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., said that in the goldsector, &quot;The market's ability to rise above $400 and hold thegains was very significant.&quot;   Ian MacDonald, vice president, Credit Suisse, New York,said &quot;the majority of the buying, especially for bullion, iscoming out of the Middle East,&quot; adding, &quot;There seems to be amajor shift among investors toward gold because of war andinflation.&quot; He noted that silver was pulled up by gold.   London dealers said investors in the Far East, Europe andthe U.S. also joined in the buying that sent gold hurtlinghigher.   The gold price could rise as high as $423, analysts said.But the market is very volatile, and any setback, such as aslump in the global stock market, could be negative for goldbecause it would point to a recession and slower jewelrydemand, they said.   Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Metal TradingAdvisors in Toronto, said a number of factors accounted forthe exceptional strength of the gold market. &quot;There is atightness in the gold supply,&quot; he said. This triggeredshort-covering, or the buying back of contracts by traderswho had previously sold in anticipation that prices woulddecline, Mr. Nichols said.   Mr. Nichols said producers had been heavy sellersrecently. Yesterday, however, &quot;apparently they didn't haveany more gold to sell, and this helped prices rise more thanhad been expected.&quot;   Finally, Mr. Nichols noted, gold was due to go up because&quot;it had some catching up with the rise in the price of oiland to compensate for the drop in the dollar.&quot;   Last-trade prices were mixed in the &quot;soft&quot; commoditymarkets. September delivery cocoa was down $44 per metric tonto $1,097, while October sugar was unchanged at 10.49 cents apound. September coffee was up 2.10 cents a pound at 95.60cents, mostly on reports that a dock strike may be eruptingin Brazil, the world's major coffee producer.   September copper's last trade was at $1.2010, for adecline of 1.90 cents a pound. There was strongoptions-related buying early in the day in London, but thispetered out later. By the time copper opened for trading inNew York on the Commodity Exchange prices in London hadalready turned downward, and the decline was reflected in theNew York market in what one analyst described as &quot;dulltrading.&quot; Cash markets for copper were quiet. Japan hasrecently been a strong buyer of physical copper but nointerest was in evidence from that quarter yesterday, ananalyst said. Another analyst noted that Thursday's intradayhigh of $1.3430 in the New York September contract, which wasa new life-of-contract high, was the highest price for thatcontract since October 1989. October cotton was off 1.55cents a pound to 73.35 cents. A trader said contracts weresold in the wake of a U.S. Department of Agriculture report.&quot;It was mildly bullish,&quot; the trader added, &quot;but that had beenexpected and was already in the market. Traders then startedselling.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
