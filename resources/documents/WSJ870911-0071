But in a rebuke to the Justice Department and the Bell companies, he continued to forbid the concerns from providing long-distance telephone service and from manufacturing telecommunications products. He also limited the Bell companies' role in the information market to the &quot;transmission&quot; of data, rather than the potentially far more lucrative business of selling such services as home banking, financial information and so-called electronic yellow pages.    &quot;The monopoly bottlenecks continue to exist essentially in unchanged scope and form, and they continue to provide the same basis for anti-competitive activity as they did prior to the Bell system breakup,&quot; Judge Greene ruled in Washington, D.C. The 64-year-old jurist has broad jurisdiction over the telecommunications industry through his continuing oversight of the consent decree that broke up American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. in January 1984.    In the spring, the Justice Department asked him largely to lift the continuing restrictions on the Bell companies. Judge Greene's ruling yesterday appears carefully crafted to assuage critics in Congress and industry that he has held back the regional companies and retarded the introduction of vital new technology. &quot;He's very politically astute,&quot; said Harry Shooshan, a Washington communications consultant and former chief counsel of the House telecommunications subcommittee. &quot;He's protected his flanks.&quot;    But the regional Bell companies generally lambasted the decision; some called it &quot;amazing&quot; and &quot;astounding.&quot; Two companies, Ameritech and Bell Atlantic Corp., held out the prospect of taking their case to Congress.    &quot;The court has cast a vote against competition in the telecommunications industry,&quot; said Thomas E. Bolger, Bell Atlantic's chairman and chief executive officer. Alluding to ATandamp;T, he said the ruling &quot;perpetuates a single company's dominance of the long-distance market.&quot;    In Chicago, William L. Weiss, Ameritech's chairman and chief executive, said the judge's refusal to lift the manufacturing ban will force the regional companies to continue relying on competitors, mainly ATandamp;T, for crucial equipment. &quot;I have to run to suppliers who are my competitors to develop the technology I need,&quot; said Mr. Weiss.    But executives in the manufacturing and long-distance businesses, including those at ATandamp;T, expressed relief. The ruling &quot;gives us some stability,&quot; said Charles Marshall, an ATandamp;T vice chairman. Keeping the Bell companies out of long distance and the manufacturing of telecommunications equipment makes ATandamp;T's investments in those businesses &quot;more solid now,&quot; Mr. Marshall said.    Judge Greene's decision was also seen as a boost to the electronic information industry. Information companies have been trying for years to create a mass market for such services as home shopping and electronic publishing, but their efforts have been hampered by the high cost of computer terminals and data transmission. While the cost of computer terminals remains a problem, yesterday's ruling could substantially reduce transmission costs by opening up the regional Bells' vast phone networks to information companies. But few observers expect the industry to heat up quickly.    Judge Greene abolished the requirements that the regional companies get his approval before they acquire non-communications businesses and that they limit those holdings to less than 10% of their revenue. The Bell companies have complained that this process harshly constrains their ability to act quickly on acquisitions -- even though the judge has given his approval in nearly every instance.    In carving out a spot for the seven regional companies in the information business, the judge said their participation was crucial if videotex and other services are to be available to the mass of consumers. Several U.S. publishers have had millions of dollars in losses from videotex systems that electronically deliver news, stock prices and shopping information. Such services are routinely available to personal-computer users, but those users represent a tiny fraction of all U.S. consumers.    In a brief interview, Judge Greene said he had the French Minitel system in mind in his opinion. In France, the state-owned telephone company provides about three million computer terminals free to customers and runs a computerized network of information. Providing the information itself is largely the province of newspaper publishers. In his ruling yesterday, Judge Greene described a situation that would closely parallel the French system, but he didn't urge the Bell companies to provide free equipment.    Judge Greene left for court proceedings next month the exact definition of the &quot;transmission&quot; functions that the Bell companies could perform. And before the companies could actually enter the information field, the Federal Communications Commission must finish a regulatory proceeding governing their participation.    Peter Huber, a Justice Department consultant whose study of the telecommunications business Judge Greene quoted liberally, said the ruling represented &quot;a big step forward&quot; for the information business, and gives the judge greater power in deciding issues at the heart of telecommunications, such as information services.    Judge Greene's continuing role infuriated Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the powerful chairman of the House Commerce Committee, who accused the judge of &quot;arrogating power to determine whether and when the American people will be allowed to receive advanced new services.&quot; Rep. Dingell threatened to back legislation that would give the regional companies broader freedom.    Congress, however, has been unable to enact legislation governing the telephone industry, reflecting the deep division among large and influential business lobbies about how to proceed. Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), for instance, a Commerce Committee member and chairman of the House telecommunications subcommittee, was far more supportive of Judge Greene than was Rep. Dingell. &quot;My sense is that the judge's decision won't trigger any immediate legislative initiatives,&quot; Rep. Markey said.    Moreover, any legislative push would also have to clear the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, which are skeptical of the need to act.    Despite the outcry from the Baby Bells, analysts generally were less critical of Judge Greene. &quot;I guess this is positive because it is a step in the direction of loosening restrictions,&quot; said Jack Grubman, an analyst with PaineWebber Group Inc. Analysts said the ruling could lead to a resumption of the regional companies' earnings growth by the end of the decade.    Analysts also said the decision wasn't much of a surprise, and it didn't provoke much of a reaction in the stock market. Shares of the seven regional Bells generally closed little changed yesterday. ATandamp;T closed at $32.75, up 50 cents; it was the most active issue in New York Stock Exchange composite trading as volume totaled 2.7 million shares. MCI Communications Corp. closed at $8.875, up 12.5 cents, in national over-the-counter trading.    Robert L. Smith Jr., executive director of the Videotex Industry Association, said the ruling is the shot in the arm the industry has long needed. Currently, there are only 40 or so videotex services offering, for example, home banking and electronic airline schedules. They serve only about 750,000 subscribers, or less than 1% of U.S. households.    Judge Greene's ruling, Mr. Smith said, might allow the regional companies to provide a service that would allow consumers to dial one number to reach thousands of different information vendors. Currently, consumers have to subscribe to different services separately. Moreover, he added, the phone companies might be able to provide centralized billing, so that customers get a videotex service bill along with the monthly phone bill.    But Jerry McAndrews of the Competitive Telecommunications Association, said that just allowing the Bells into information services doesn't mean an explosion of new services. Videotex, for example, is widely available in France because the government gave away terminals, a situation unlikely to exist in the U.S., he said. &quot;I'm not sure that the Bells' providing information services is essential to those services being brought to market,&quot; Mr. McAndrews said. &quot;The publishers will tell you they can handle electronic publishing needs when there is a market for them.&quot;    ---                       Beyond Telephones                                               PERCENTAGE                             TOTAL 1986         FROM NON-                               REVENUES         TELEPHONE                          (In billions)        ACTIVITIES Ameritech                        $ 9.4              9.3% Bell Atlantic                      9.9              6.0 BellSouth                         11.4             10.0 NYNEX                             11.3              8.5 Pacific Telesis                    9.0    less than 5.0 Southwestern Bell                  7.9             10.0 US West                            8.3              9.0    Sources: The companies and analysts' estimates</TEXT></DOC>
