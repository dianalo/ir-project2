It was amistake.   &quot;We just got a lot of one-shot business,&quot; shrugs Mrs.Edelmann. Worse, some of the one-time buyers kept thereturnable bottles, which command up to $40 at flea markets.So the Edelmanns went back to operating Pittsburgh SeltzerWorks the way it was done in the old days -- that is, in theearly part of the century.</LP><TEXT>   Customers leave wooden crates of empty bottles on theirporches. The delivery man scoops them up and refills theirorders. &quot;It's so easy. It's like being taken care of,&quot; sayscustomer Holly Dobkin, who likes the sound of the bottlesclanging because it reminds her of simpler times.   In this era of telemarketing and junk-mail hype, a fewbusinesses are selling their products the old-fashioned way:door to door. These companies survive, and some even thrive,by providing personal touches or making life a little easier.   &quot;We're not sales clerks waiting for someone to come in andbuy something,&quot; says Frank Gagliardi, president of World BookEducational Products in Chicago, whose World Bookencyclopedias are sold door to door. &quot;We go out and sell.&quot;   That can be lucrative. Kirby Co., a Clevelandvacuum-cleaner maker, says some of its salespeople earn morethan $250,000 a year working strictly on commission. Andunlike items sold in stores, their products don't have tofight for shelf space or compete for consumer attention.   But the approach is getting tougher in many ways. As thepublic's fear of crime mounts, fewer people are willing toopen the door to strangers. And as more women get jobs, fewerpeople remain at home to answer the bell in the first place.   Nevertheless, some companies are able to overcome thosebarriers. Here are three firms that are prospering by goingdirectly to the consumer, despite the odds.                                                                                                          PITTSBURGH SELTZER                                                                                                          The bottles of Pittsburgh Seltzer Works look as thoughthey've been plucked out of an old black-and-white movie. Themachinery for processing and bottling the fizzy water datesto around 1907. And the Edelmanns' calling card adds to thenostalgic aura: It features a 1930s drawing of a mansquirting seltzer and the motto, &quot;You ring, we bring.&quot;   The key to Pittsburgh Seltzer's success is service. TheEdelmanns deliver directly to all 700 customers, many of whomthey know on a first-name basis. Some customers are sotrusting they give the delivery man the keys to their homesso he can put the seltzer in the refrigerator.   The company forgoes marketing gimmicks; its one deliveryvan is solid white, without the company name or logo. &quot;Weprefer to increase our business through word of mouth becausethose are our best customers,&quot; explains Mrs. Edelmann, a41-year-old who by training is a speech and hearingtherapist.   But that doesn't mean the business hasn't benefited fromnew trends, such as the growing popularity of beverages freeof calories, alchohol and caffeine. Many of the Edelmanns'customers are health buffs. Others are recycling enthusiastswho like the reusable bottles. The Edelmanns, who bought thebusiness a decade ago when there were only 20 customers, saythey have always made a profit but decline to give earningsor revenue figures.                                                                                                          WORLD BOOK                                                                                                          World Book's sales representatives still have to get afoot in the door, just as they did when the company wasstarted in 1917. But they do it. Though sales last year rosea meager 1.4% to $360 million from $355 million in 1989, theywere up 31% from $275 million in 1984. (The company isprofitable but doesn't divulge earnings.)   Four out of five sales representatives are women who areeither teachers or former teachers. One of them is FrancesBlais, of San Dimas, Calif. Mrs. Blais, who is 55 and hasraised six children, often puts in 12 1/2-hour days, makingpitches in four or more homes.   She also teaches reference skills at local schools. &quot;Isatisfy my love of teaching this way. And when I'm out makingcalls I'm educating the parent to be a better parent,&quot; shesays.   &quot;It's all teaching and that's what makes me go,&quot; she adds.&quot;Otherwise I'd be out selling houses or computers.&quot;   In her 16 years with World Book, Ms. Blais says the onlynew wrinkle she has adopted is setting up carts or booths inmalls to drum up sales leads. And although she drove 73,000miles last year, she refuses to install a car phone, therebydepriving potential buyers of the chance to cancel meetings.                                                                                                          KIRBY                                                                                                          The sales approach taught by Kirby also has been polishedto precision over the years. The sales person -- usually amale -- offers a gift, such as scented soap or hams, inexchange for allowing a home demonstration. Showing themachine, which can cost as much as $1,200, takes at least anhour and often two.   Ideal prospects include people who have purchased anothervacuum cleaner and wonder whether it actually sucks up thedirt, says Gene Windfeldt, who became president of Kirbyafter his St. Cloud, Minn., distributorship consistently sold1,000 machines a month.   Kirby's sales last year were about $200 million, up 21%from $165 million in 1989 and almost double 1984's $107million. It is in the black but doesn't give profit figures.   The sales clincher, says Mr. Windfeldt, is often &quot;the dirtmeter,&quot; a filter that clips onto the machine and shows theprospective customer how much dust and grit were missed in aprevious cleaning.   Although more women work outside the home, Mr. Windfeldtcontends that has worked to Kirby's advantage because theyhave more money to buy better equipment. More salesdemonstrations are now made at work sites and later in theevening to accommodate working couples, he says.   Mr. Windfeldt recalls that most vacuum cleaners were solddoor to door when he entered the business 26 years ago. &quot;NowKirby is one of the last survivors,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
