Student leaders said a class boycott that began Monday hasspread to 41 universities and colleges around Beijing, involvingmore than 70,000 students. At least four more schools joined theprotest today, they said.   Two protest leaders said students were ready to stage streetdemonstrations again as they did when they began their campaign 10days ago.   Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping on Tuesday ordered authorities tocrack down on the protest, said a journalist at the People's Daily,the voice of the ruling Communist Party.   ``The peasants support us, the workers support us, the armysupports us, so why should we be bothered by students,'' thejournalist quoted the 84-year-old Deng as saying.   His remarks prompted the People's Daily to publish a harsheditorial that called the student movement ``a planned conspiracy''aimed at overthrowing the government. The editorial said furtherprotests would be forbidden.   The country's major newspapers and radio stations carried theeditorial, and millions of Communist Party members met to discussit and to prepare for the crackdown.   More than 1,000 party members met in Beijing and ``resolutelycondemned the illegal student activities,'' said the Beijing citytelevision news.   The Beijing Daily, meanwhile, published an order from the citygovernment telling students to disband their ``illegal'' unions.Most of the unions were formed last week after students in Beijingvoted down the official student organizations, which are set up byuniversity officials.   About 10,000 troops from the 38th Army, a special force forsuppressing civic disturbances, have taken up positions inbuildings near university campuses, students and Chinese sourcessaid.   Student leaders pledged to defy the government and said theywere ready to go back to the streets to protest if the governmentdoes not heed their demands for negotiations.   ``If the government does not agree to a dialogue we will marchin the streets,'' said Beijing University student leader Wang Danat a meeting attended by 2,000 students at the Political Scienceand Law College. ``That is our right. We will take the movement tothe people.''   Since early last week, tens of thousands of students have beenagitating for fundamental changes in China's political system,including a free press and publication of the financial records ofChina's leaders.   They have also called for the resignations of Deng and ofPremier Li Peng.   ``We will only develop into a strong country when we respecthuman rights and allow the people more freedom,'' said one studentat Qinghua University. ``We've had an emperor for too long, what weneed is a president.''   Students at several universities said they were outraged by theeditorial and accused the state-run press of distorting facts.   ``The editorial is rubbish, it is filled with lies and itinsults the students,'' Wu'er Kaixi, a student leader from BeijingNormal University, told the crowd at the Political Science and LawCollege.   The editorial accused the students of trying to overthrow thegovernment and insinuated their movement in Beijing was connectedto violence last week in Xian and Changsha, two provincial capitals.   Last week, crowds of youths entered the ranks of protestingstudents and went on rampages in Changsha and Xian, looting stores,burning automobiles and buildings and beating policemen.   The disturbances received prominent play in the Chinese press asthe government sought to associate them with the largely peacefulprotests in Beijing.   The media has remained largely silent about protests Friday andSaturday in Beijing when more than 150,000 students and theirsupporters spent the night at Tiananmen Square to call fordemocracy and commemorate the death of ousted Communist Partyleader Hu Yaobang.   Hu, a relatively liberal politician, was purged in 1987 for notcracking down hard enough on pro-democracy protests.   The peaceful protest was one of the largest in Communist China's40-year history and to date the clearest rejection by China's youthof the system.</TEXT></DOC>
