Saw Maung formed amilitary-dominated government today and the official media reportedhis troops killed 59 people, most of them in clashes with looters.   One witness reported gunfire in downtown Rangoon tonight.   On Monday, troops shot and killed at least 100 people inquelling widespread opposition to Saw Maung's rule. More than 200people have been reported killed since he seized power Sunday.   Opposition leaders issued a joint statement calling for talkswith Saw Maung to resolve the crisis.   State-run Radio Rangoon said Saw Maung was both the defense andforeign affairs ministers in the new government. He was defenseminister and armed forces commander when he seized power Sundayfrom civilian President Maung Maung.   No president or prime minister was named today, and there was noword on Maung Maung's fate.   Only one of the nine Cabinet ministers named was a civilian,Minister of Health Pe Thein. At least six ministers were among the18 senior officers who mounted the coup with Saw Maung.   The broadcast said the military commanders in each of thecountry's seven states and seven divisions also would serve as thetop government representatives in those areas.   Troops on Monday shot and killed at least 100 people protestingthe coup and the two sides battled late into the night. Someprotesters hurled gasoline bombs at troops who fired back.   State radio reported five incidents today in which securityforces killed looters and other civilians.   Troops dispersed a crowd of 50 people looting a warehouse eightmiles north of downtown Rangoon at 4 a.m., killing eight people,the radio said. Sixteen people died when troops tried to stop morethan 200 people from looting a warehouse in the Thamaing campus ofRangoon University, it said.   Security forces shot and killed 16 people looting the FisheriesDepartment head office in downtown Rangoon in the early morning,and five people died as troops broke up looting at a biscuitfactory in the northern part of the capital, the radio said.   Troops killed another 14 people when a military truck on patrolin east Rangoon was attacked, it said.   Witnesses reported one person was shot and killed as soldiershalted looting at a market in the city.   Sporadic clashes also were reported in Mandalay in central Burmabut no details were available. Telephone communications were outafter the communications department's microwave dish was damaged inthe morning, reportedly by some kind of rocket.   Bloody protests and general strikes began Aug. 8, topplinghard-line President Sein Lwin four days later.   Today, military trucks rolled down Rangoon's streets withloudspeakers warning soldiers would shoot anyone buildingbarricades, an Asian diplomat in Rangoon speaking on condition ofanonymity said.   People hurried home after buying food at the few small shopsthat were open.   Three key opposition leaders issued a statement today condemningthe bloodshed and telling coup leaders that ``such suppression byforce of arms will not stop the people's just demand fordemocracy.''   They demanded talks with Saw Maung ``to seek ways to correctlysolve the current crisis.''   The statement was issued by former Brig. Gen. Aung Gyi, formerDefense Minister Tin Oo and Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of Burma'slate independence leader.   In the statement, they also rebuffed offers from the country'sethnic insurgents to support the pro-democracy demonstrations, andtold authorities to stop spreading rumors that the rebels hadinfiltrated the demonstrations.   The top Buddhist monks organization also issued a statementappealing for dialogue between the two sides.   Saw Maung overthrew Maung Maung, who took over Aug. 19 asBurma's first civilian leader since the 1962 military coup. MaungMaung had ended martial law and withdrawn soldiers from the streetsas a concession to protesters. But the opposition demanded that heallow an interim government conduct the democratic elections he hadpromised.   Troops returned in force after Sunday's coup by Saw Maung, whosaid he took over to halt Burma's social chaos and ensure theelections were held.   On Monday, soldiers enforcing Saw Maung's ban on publicgatherings shot monks, students, government workers and otherunarmed demonstrators. Reporters conservatively estimated at least100 dead. About 40 demonstrators and 17 soldiers died in clashesSunday.   Some diplomats suggested Saw Maung seized power to save theBurma Socialist Program Party, the target of months of widespreadstreet protests. Protesters blame the country's sole legal partyfor 26 years of repression and economic ruin.   Burma has been in turmoil since students rioted last Septemberagainst government economic policies. Security forces killed scoresof protesters in March and June, and demonstrations since July haveforced the resignations of longtime strongman Ne Win and hissuccessor, Sein Lwin, who lasted 17 days. At least 112 people diedin the rioting against Sein Lwin.</TEXT></DOC>
