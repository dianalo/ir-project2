<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-49-0791 </DOCNO><TEXT>Several years ago a research program was designed to isolate and characterizenew and better strains of PCB-degrading bacteria and to characterizethose biotransformations that are occurring in nature. Recently, thisresearch program was expanded in an effort to explore the possibilityof using one or more of the authors new bacterial isolates for the decontaminationof PCB-laden soil. Corynebacterium sp. MB1, A. eutrophus H850, and P.putida LB400 had all been shown to have excellent PCB-degrading capabilities;however, little was known about their ability to oxidize PCBs adsorbedto soil. The authors initial studies using sand as a model demonstratedthat PCBs were biodegradable even when bound to a solid substrate. Theyhave continued with model biodegradation studies using PCB-laden soilcontaining either Aroclors or pure PCB congeners. They have extendedtheir Aroclor biodegradation studies to higher concentrations and moredifficult Aroclors. In addition to their Aroclor studies they have beenconducting resting-cell assays using soil-bound pure PCB congeners inan effort to define the rates of degradation of selected PCB cogenersand to determine the metabolites produced from these biotransformations.Other research topics include: modeling nonbiological sources of apparentbiodegradation; and biodegrading soil-bound polychlorinated biphenylsby genetically engineered bacteria.</TEXT></DOC>
