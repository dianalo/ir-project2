The report said 23 prisoners have been fasting 34days or more, and 26 are hospitalized. The ANC considers themto be political prisoners, but South African officialsdisagree. The prisoners began their hunger strike to protesttheir continued imprisonment after the April 30 deadlineagreed to by the government for the release of politicalprisoners.   U.S. law prohibits the removal of sanctions againstapartheid until the South African government &quot;releases allpersons persecuted for their political beliefs.&quot; Anadministration official said in Washington the U.S. believesthat nearly all, if not all, South African politicalprisoners have been released and that the U.S. doesn't, ingeneral, view people who committed violent acts as politicalprisoners.   These beliefs would align the Bush administration withSouth African government positions that the ANC opposes. TheANC and other anti-apartheid organizations insist thatprisoners who committed acts in the course of fighting racistrule, regardless of the crime, should be considered politicalprisoners and freed under the agreement reached last Augustbetween the ANC and the government.   H.J. Coetsee, the South African minister of justice andcorrection services, told parliament on Tuesday thatprisoners falling into 14 categories of political offensesalso committed violent crimes. Those that weren't released byApril 30 &quot;are prisoners who have committed offenses involvingmurder, assault, inflicting serious wounds, rape, robbery,etc. . . . . We are talking about a dispute that we have toface.&quot;   The Mandela statement said the prisoners' decision to goon hunger strike was an &quot;heroic&quot; one &quot;forced on them by theinexcusable failure of the government to honor the agreementto release all political prisoners by the end of April.&quot;   Mass campaigns, in the form of demonstrations and consumerboycotts, have already begun. Mr. Mandela also called on &quot;theworld community to make it clear to the South Africangovernment that its attitude is unacceptable.&quot;   The Bush administration will review the sanctions issueafter the scheduled termination of the legal pillars ofapartheid on June 30. Parliament on Wednesday ordered repealof the Group Areas and Land acts, which segregate areas byrace. Repeal of the Population Registration Act, whichclassifies all South Africans by race, is slated for thismonth, although President F.W. de Klerk has said transitionalmeasures will be needed until a new constitution takeseffect.   Separately, the Inkatha Freedom Party and the rulingNational Party appear to be moving closer to making theirworking relationship a formal alliance. Both parties havebeen in conflict with the ANC, the country's mainpro-democracy organization. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha'spresident, said that a &quot;lot of common ground&quot; has beenreached in ongoing discussions between the two parties, butthat a coalition hadn't been discussed.   ---   Robert S.
