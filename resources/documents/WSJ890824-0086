In a recent letter to board members, the Mutual Fund Education Alliance, wracked by defections, says it needs a big cash infusion to survive. &quot;Cash reserves are at an all-time low -- an unfortunate and regrettable situation brought about by the organization's past use of dues earmarked for the future to meet current expenses,&quot; the letter said.    The jam reflects a splintering in the mutual fund industry between load and no-load groups. Only a few years ago, funds either were classified as &quot;load&quot; -- those with initial sales charges of as much as 8.5% and sold through brokers -- or &quot;no load,&quot; which primarily were sold directly to investors.    But that distinction has become blurred. Many direct-marketed funds charge &quot;low loads&quot; of 3% or less. Others have imposed exit fees and marketing and distribution charges, resulting in fewer true no-loads.    That trend led the trade group last year to de-emphasize the words &quot;no load&quot; in its name, although the term was retained in a subtitle. The name change, from the No-Load Mutual Fund Association, reflected a decline in the number of true no-load funds in the group to about 250 out of a total of 450 funds.    But the name change also raised the ire of some no-load fund executives who are proud they don't charge sales fees. Many fund groups have defected, saying the trade group has lost an identity that offered a marketing edge.    The alliance is suffering an &quot;identity crisis,&quot; says Dennis W. Cross, executive vice president at USAA Investment Management Co., which recently quit. &quot;We're real strong believers in the no-load concept,&quot; Mr. Cross said, &quot;and we felt the Education Alliance wasn't going in that direction.&quot;    &quot;That's a lot overblown,&quot; counters Robert Edwards, the alliance's president. &quot;By far our largest constituency are no-loads by any measure.&quot; Still, the trade group said in its letter that it needs a &quot;special assessment&quot; of 50% of annual dues from members besides the 1990 membership fees to continue. Annual dues range from $500 to $24,000, depending on the size of the fund group.    Mr. Edwards says the group needs about $300,000 to continue, adding that the money is needed by the end of September.    The cash will be used to get the group &quot;back on solid financial footing&quot; so new programs and activities can be launched, according to the letter. These include distribution of a question-and-answer newspaper column about mutual fund investing written by Mr. Edwards, plus a new directory of member firms.    But some board members privately were pessimistic about the group's chances. &quot;If they don't get it -- and they probably won't get it -- that's it,&quot; said one board member. &quot;It's as simple as that.&quot;    Kemper Corp., which offers mostly load funds sold through brokers but which had joined the group as a marketing tool, says it won't renew its membership because its interests now conflict with the educational aims of the trade group.    &quot;The organization changed from representing direct-marketed, no-load funds to becoming an education alliance for them,&quot; says Gerald Cole, executive vice president at Kemper Financial Services Inc. &quot;Our main thrust is through brokers, and we feel we no longer have a reason to be a member because it's really designed for a different purpose.&quot;    Several seceding members have joined a competing association of low-cost funds. The &quot;100% No-Load Mutual Fund Council,&quot; formed several months ago, consists of a small group of mutual funds without sales charges of any kind. Among the group's 110 members are funds with some of the best long-term track records in the industry, including Mutual Series Corp., Lindner Management Corp. and Nicholas Co. </TEXT></DOC>
