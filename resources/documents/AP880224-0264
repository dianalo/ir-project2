CORNELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A lively Pentecostal denomination, shattered bythe successive shaming of its two most dazzling TV evangelists,this week was in a state of trauma.   Some of its leaders were questioning the propriety of televisionpreaching itself.   ``There's a great deal of sadness, shock and grief over thewhole situation,'' said Juleen Turnage, communications officer forthe Assemblies of God, based in Springfield, Mo.   ``We're back in the shades of 1987,'' she added, referring towhen the sexual lapses struck in the case of ex-TV star Jim Bakker,and now had hit fiery TV preacher Jimmy Swaggart.   ``It's a tremendous shock, so totally out of character with whathe preached,'' said the Rev. Robert Spence, president of thedenomination's Evangel College.   ``It's going to have a very, very serious effect on thoseministries that are still on television. The element of suspicionof it is going to become even more acute.''   Some think that may be a good idea. Clinical psychologist LarryBass, a denominational member, says there is ``something corruptingabout the power'' of dominating huge crowds.   ``There's a kind of narcissistic evil that attracts people tothat kind of work, all the self-aggrandizement it gives them. TVgives it even larger magnitude.''   He suggests local congregations should teach people to be morecritical in viewing TV preachers and particularly to guard againstthese dangerous tendencies:   _``Putting anyone up on a pedestal, or believing they'revirtually the voice of God.   _``Ministers who put down other religions and people and who areextremely judgmental about the faults of others.''   He said Swaggart seemed to fit these categories, almostmesmerizing crowds with his sizzling, emotional fervor and hisblistering attacks on other religions and on other people's sexualflaws.   ``Nobody has all the answers, and for anyone to act as if theydo is a big danger sign,'' Bass said. Noting that Swaggartsometimes said anyone who disagreed with him was wrong, Bass added:   ``Anyone who sets himself up with that kind of authority, thathe's always absolutely correct, is a dangerous thing, and hardly tobe trusted.''   However, he said ``it's unfortunately true'' that the typicalkind of followers Swaggart attracts ``are the most gullible.''   Religion Professor Stanley M. Burgess, an Assemblies scholar ofSouthwestern Missouri State University in Springfield, said thefall of such high-powered evangelists as Swaggart serves this clearwarning:   ``We must be careful not to label as gold everything thatglitters.''   Such celebrated preachers ``still have feet of clay,'' Burgesssaid. ``People have to show greater discernment about them,recognizing that we're not dealing with God here but humans who canfall.''   Even in the scandals, he said, ``I would hope people will notdrool over it, but learn from it, and look for a silver lining.''   For one thing, he added, ``people who have supported TVministries may now put their support back in local churches andsynagogues, where it has been missing in many cases.''   A noted church communications expert, the Rev. William F. Fore,maintains that religion, when it buys into television, is co-optedby it and becomes a victim to its focus on self-gratification andquick-fix answers.   It ``maximizes self-interest,'' he said in his recent book,``Television and Religion,'' grossly twisting the biblical emphasison selfless service.   ``This corruption of the fundamental biblical concept ofconscience into self-interest is perhaps the most serious of allthe electronic church's distortions.''   Spence said there is ``nothing wrong'' with the medium oftelevision itself, but that it does involve detachment from thelocal congregation, ``where there is a greater degree ofaccountability.''   ``In television, there's not that closeness, of a ministerliving among his people,'' Spence said.   Furthermore, he added, other aspects of TV raise the``posibility of distortion,'' such as TV's continual concern of``what it will look like,'' and how a ``program will go over'' witha mass, theologically uninformed audience.   He said that when someone in that situation has been verysuccessful, there's a tendency ``to live in an unreal world, filledonly with people who are saying what they think he wants to hear.   ``It's an artificial environment that distorts the wholeperspective and can lead to a point of assuming you're strongerthan you really are ... that `what might bother other people doesnot affect me'.''   But despite the deflecting aspects, he said, ``a person has tobe of the compromising type to cross over the line'' in his morals,something Swaggart was ``definitely not'' in his words. His conductturned out to be something else.   That, Spence said, ``is part of the tremendous shock.''   The Rev. Richard Champion, editor of the denomination's weekly,Pentecostal Evangel, said church leaders ``are going through apersonal trauma. Here was this brother in Christ, and suddenly thishappens, and we have to deal with the fallout.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs Feb. 26</NOTE></DOC>
