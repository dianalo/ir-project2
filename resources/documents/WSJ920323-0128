The multiculturalists and PC police vigorouslycondemned all criticisms of their efforts to politicizeeducation, branding them as products of &quot;right-wingmisinformation.&quot;   It is instructive, therefore, to follow the argument ofArthur M. Schlesinger Jr.'s trenchant meditation on theintellectual and social liabilities of multiculturalism. Itis hardly possible to impugn Mr. Schlesinger's liberalcredentials. The former special adviser to President Kennedyhas long been a prominent liberal spokesman.</LP><TEXT>   Yet &quot;The Disuniting of America: Reflections on aMulticultural Society&quot; (Norton, 160 pages, $14.95), whichbegan life last year as a monograph published by WhittleCommunications, mounts one of the most devastating andarticulate attacks on multiculturalism yet to appear. Mr.Schlesinger begins by noting the obvious: that America, acountry of immigrants, has always been a multicultural andmultiethnic society. Indeed, America's singular achievementhas been to forge a society in which vast religious, ethnicand racial differences are subordinated to the higher unityof national identity.   The problem comes when this conciliatory vision of amulticultural society gives way to the ideology ofmulticulturalism with its politics of ethnic and racialredress. It happened in the 1910s, when a wave of ethnicmilitancy swept the country. Theodore Roosevelt was right towarn that &quot;The one absolutely certain way of bringing thisnation to ruin . . . would be to permit it to become a tangleof squabbling nationalities.&quot;   The same danger threatens us again now as multiculturalismsweeps our schools and universities. Mr. Schlesinger warnsthat &quot;A cult of ethnicity has arisen both among non-Anglowhites and among nonwhite minorities to denounce the idea ofa melting pot, to challenge the concept of `one people,' andto protect, promote, and perpetuate separate ethnic andracial communities.&quot;   We have all become familiar with the kinds of foolishnessthat the demand for multiculturalism and politicalcorrectness has brought to our schools and college campuses.The denunciation of Western civilization as racist, sexist,elitist and patriarchal; the efforts by collegeadministrations to enforce speech codes on college campuses;the blatant rewriting of history texts to soothe woundedethnic feelings: All threaten to undermine the traditionalideals upon which American democracy rests. It is for thisreason, as Mr. Schlesinger points out, that &quot;The debate aboutthe curriculum is a debate about what it means to be anAmerican.&quot;   Consider the phenomenon of Afrocentricism, which holdsthat Africa is the &quot;mother&quot; of Western civilization, that allintellectual developments from Greek philosophy to medicineand technology had their origin in Africa, that the canons ofWestern rationality are foreign (and inferior) to the morespontaneous forms of &quot;African knowledge.&quot; According to onespokesman for this new species of racist claptrap, &quot;Blacksuperiority in the areas of mental development&quot; is &quot;relatedto the possession of a high level of melanin.&quot;   Lest one think that such musings are confined to a lunaticfringe, it is important to note that an Afrocentriccurriculum has been adopted by schools in Milwaukee,Indianapolis, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Detroit and manyother cities. Proponents say that Afrocentricism gives blackstudents a sense of their roots and enhances theirself-esteem. But as Frederick Douglass observed long ago, &quot;Noone idea has given rise to more oppression and persecutiontoward colored people of this country than that which makesAfrica, not America, their home.&quot;   Mr. Schlesinger's criticism of Afrocentricism and othermanifestations of radical multiculturalism is sober,relentless and utterly convincing. But he is equallyrelentless about the failings of our society, frequentlyreminding readers that the U.S. has suffered grievously fromthe &quot;curse of racism&quot; and other social pathologies.   But unlike multiculturalists, Mr. Schlesinger recognizesthat Western culture has also been the cradle of politicaland social liberty, that it has provoked &quot;great movements toend slavery, to raise the status of women, to abolishtorture, to combat racism, to defend freedom of inquiry andexpression, to advance personal liberty and human rights.&quot; Herightly insists that such liberating ideals &quot;are Europeanideas, not Asian, nor African, nor Middle Eastern ideas,except by adoption.&quot;   As a historian, Mr. Schlesinger is particularly appalledby the attempt to use history as a tool of politicalindoctrination or therapy to bolster the self-esteem ofselected victim groups. &quot;The high purpose of history is notthe presentation of self nor the vindication of identity butthe recognition of complexity and the search for knowledge,&quot;he writes.   At a moment when virulent nationalism and ethnic hatredhave resurfaced around the world, it is well to reflect onthe consequences of unchecked multiculturalism. Its partisansclaim that it is the path to freedom and diversity. But asMr. Schlesinger's eloquent book shows, it is really the roadto intellectual Yugoslavia.
