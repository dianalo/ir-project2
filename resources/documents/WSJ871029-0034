T. Rowe Price Growth Stock. Pioneer II. Of the biggest mutual funds, these are among the best known.    But they haven't been the best performers during the stock market's nosedive. Leading the pack among the giant flagship stock funds are the lesser-known AMCAP Fund and Investment Company of America, both of the Los Angeles-based American Funds Group, and the popular Vanguard Windsor Fund.    By battening down the hatches in recent months -- moving a portion of their assets into cash or bonds and shifting their portfolios in favor of so-called defensive stocks -- these funds have emerged with the fewest scars from the market crash.    What follows is a look at how some of the country's biggest and best-known stock funds have fared in recent weeks, and how their portfolio managers are positioning themselves now.    The funds cited here have differing investment objectives; those that emphasize growth over income tend to be more vulnerable in bear markets.    Moreover, experts on mutual funds caution that investors shouldn't put too much emphasis on short-term performance. Most big stock funds are designed as long-term investments, and quarter-to-quarter rankings are notoriously unreliable as a guide to future performance.    WINDSOR FUND   Because about 20% of the fund's portfolio has been in cash and bonds for most of this year, Windsor trailed the gains of the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index by 11.3 percentage points going into October. But as of Tuesday, the growth-and-income fund was more than three points ahead of the Sandamp;P 500.    Portfolio manager John Neff has jettisoned most of the fund's cash in recent days to pick up energy stocks and shares in some cyclical sectors, which it now views as bargains. &quot;A few weeks back we thought the bond market was more attractive than stocks; now we're leaning the other way,&quot; says Mr. Neff.    Because it didn't want to expand its stock portfolio, Windsor has been closed to new investors for the past 2 1/2 years. But investors who have redeemed shares are permitted to buy back in.    AMERICAN FUNDS   AMCAP Fund and Investment Company of America have kept 15% to 20% of their assets in cash for much of the past year.    Like other fund groups, American Funds says redemptions have tailed off to near-normal levels after a brief flurry early last week. Now that stock prices have plummeted, &quot;we're making up our shopping list,&quot; says a spokesman. While declining to discuss specific investments, a spokesman says the funds have been &quot;buying more than selling&quot; in recent days.    FIDELITY MAGELLAN   Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund has tended to outperform bull markets and underperform bear markets. This time is no exception: Magellan has lost 33.3% in net asset value for the month.    During fund manager Peter Lynch's 10year tenure, Magellan has had eight previous periods of decline in net asset value, ranging in length from six weeks to 27 weeks, Fidelity notes. During those periods, Magellan shed 10% to 28% of its net asset value, underperforming market averages each time. Yet, for that 10-year span, Magellan is the top-performing fund.    Although the fund's cash balance has risen to 5% from 1.4% at the end of September, Mr. Lynch appears to be positioning himself for the market's next upswing. Magellan currently is buying depressed growth companies, financial companies, and cyclicals such as office equipment, railroads, machinery and tire stocks. The fund has been selling utilities and consumer non-durables.    DREYFUS FUND   &quot;We're buying,&quot; says Howard Stein, chairman of Dreyfus Corp. Dreyfus Fund had 36% of its portfolio in cash as of Tuesday, but is reducing that as it moves more money back into the stock market, according to a spokesman.    Mr. Stein says he is turning bullish for several reasons. Indications that Western governments might let the dollar fall further spell better times for U.S. manufacturers, who have been battered by foreign competition, he says. In addition, renewed signals that the Soviet Union is &quot;willing to play with us&quot; could mean more agricultural exports, he says.    &quot;We may have a recession in the financial area,&quot; says Mr. Stein, but &quot;it doesn't mean the whole country is going to be under the gun. This is not 1929.&quot;    PIONEER II   Unlike some growth-and-income funds, &quot;We try to stay fully invested all the time,&quot; says David Tripple, portfolio manager for Pioneer II. Thus, the fund hasn't fared as well as some competitors. But the fund primarily invests for the long term, he says.    Mr. Tripple says Pioneer II has picked up 15 to 20 stocks in the past week. Among them: Baxter Travenol Laboratories, Boeing, Lockheed, Northwest Airlines and Tenneco.    ---                  Comparing the Big Funds   Performance and assets of selected stock mutual fundsthrough Oct. 26, in billions of dollars.
