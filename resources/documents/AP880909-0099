About 500 soldiersmutinied and joined the ranks of protesters demonstrating fordemocracy.   Former Prime Minister U Nu, in a letter distributed todiplomatic missions, also announced that general elections will beheld Oct. 9 and unveiled a 26-member cabinet with himself as primeminister, former president Mahn Win Maung as president and retiredGen. Tin Oo as defense minister.   There was no immediate reaction to the move, which is regardedas high treason under current law, from the government of PresidentMaung Maung or the military. But one prominent opposition figure,not included in the cabinet, called the move ``preposterous.''   Diplomats said U Nu's chances of success are difficult toaccess. Burma remains on the brink of chaos and the powerfulmilitary is still intact. Today's also announcement was not thefirst time U Nu has tried to regain control. In the 1970s, heattempted to lead an anti-Ne Win insurgency from bases along theThai-Burmese border but the attacks failed.   The mutinies from the military and U Nu's declaration came oneday after about 1 million people surged through the city of Rangoonin the largest anti-government protest since Aug. 21.   As a precautionary measure, embassies and other foreignorganizations evacuated more than 230 dependents and non-essentialstaffers aboard a commercial Thai aircraft to Bangkok, Thailand.According to diplomats, the evacuees included 46 Americans, 29Thais, 28 South Koreans, 13 British citizens, two Russians andothers from Japan and Australia.   ``Foreigners are not in danger at present but life is verydifficult,'' said one World Bank official who arrived in Bangkok.``There's no fuel and less and less food.'' The evacuations arescheduled to continue Saturday.   About 400 air force personnel along with about 100 from the navyand army marched in a student-led demonstration and called on alarge contingent of troops inside City Hall to join them. Theyreceived no response.   Most of the deserters were enlisted men but reporters sawseveral officers of lieutenant rank. There have been numerousreports of military defections to protesters seeking to toppled theauthoritarian system, but this was the first time a large group wasseen in the capital defying the government.   About 200 of the mutinous soldiers joined student leaders atRangoon University. ``We side with democracy and not withfascists!'' and ``Our military training is not to shoot people!''the rebel soldiers shouted.   ``I have taken back the power which Gen. Ne Win has robbed fromme,'' U Nu said in his letter. ``From this hour, sovereign power nolonger rests with Gen. Ne Win. It has come back into my hands, andI announce this fact with joy.''   The veteran, 82-year-old politician was toppled in a 1962 coupled by Ne Win who held the reins of power for the next 26 years.Although Ne Win officially retired as head of the ruling BurmaSocialist Program Party in July, many analysts believe he stillexercises decisive control.   Hard-line leader Sein Lwin replaced Ne Win but resigned after 17days and massive street protests that resulted in at least 112deaths. Maung Maung replaced Sein Lwin, becoming Burma's firstcivilian leader in 26 years, but protests have continued asopponents try bring about a multiparty system.   U Nu said he would stand for election but immediately turn overpower to anyone who obtained a majority of votes. Since hisgovernment cannot provide ballots and other equipment, electionswill be held at mass town meetings and will not ``under existingconditions'' be conducted in rural areas, the letter said.   The absence from U Nu's government of opposition leaders AungGyi and Aung San Suu Kyi indicated internal splits among governmentopponents.   ``I am glad my name is not there. It is simply preposterous,''Aung Gyi told reporters when asked about U Nu's action. Aung Gyi isthe nation's most outspoken critic of the government. He wasarrested in July and spent a month in prison after writing a seriesof letters critical of the government.   A Western analyst in Bangkok said that despite the great show ofanti-government force, Burma's leaders appeared to be ``going aheadwith their own timetable'' of holding a special congress Monday topave the way for a referendum on one-party rule. He said thepowerful military also appeared to be basically intact despitedefections and ``wavering''   Maung Maung took power Aug. 19. On Aug. 24, he announced aplanned congress of the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party onMonday to consider a popular referendum on one-party rule. Butprotesters have rejected his call and demanded immediate formationof an interim government.</TEXT></DOC>
