(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man charged with taking more than 110students and teachers hostage at a school Feb. 2 questioned jurorshimself as his trial on 110 counts of kidnapping opened underextraordinary security.   James L. Harvey, 43, of Tuscaloosa, served as his own attorneyduring jury selection. A pool of 65 potential jurors awaitedquestioning.   Those entering the courtroom had to pass through metaldetectors, and Madison County Chief Deputy Sheriff Charlie Normentsaid 17 deputies were on hand to protect the 104 schoolchildrensubpoenaed as witnesses by Harvey.   Dressed in a light blue suit with a dark blue tie, Harveybrought his legal papers into the courtroom in a brown grocery sackWednesday. He laid a red-covered Bible on the defense table, wherehe sat by himself.   He won the right to represent himself on Monday after promisingnot to disrupt the trial.   Harvey is accused in a 12-hour takeover of the private West EndChristian School in Tuscaloosa.   Armed with two pistols and a rifle and wearing ski masks, Harveyand another man entered the school and held 110 students andteachers hostage, saying he was trying to draw attention to thenation's homeless and hungry.   No one was injured. The standoff ended with Harvey surrenderingafter viewing a bogus pardon videotaped by Gov. Guy Hunt.   Harvey has been held on $8.4 million bail. If convicted, hecould be sentenced to more than 10,000 years in prison. Chargeswere later dropped against the other man, who police said wasforced to participate.   Judge John M. Karrh ordered the trial moved to Huntsville about160 miles away because of publicity.   Harvey asked prospective jurors whether they knew anyoneconnected with what he called ``the incident,'' whether theybelieved in the presumption of innocence for a defendant, whetherthey had any relatives in law enforcement and whether they believedin statute law vs. ``the constitutional law _ the moral law that welive under in a society.''   District Attorney Charles Freeman asked prospective jurorswhether they would automatically consider someone insane ``justbecause he committed an illogical crime.'' None said they would.   The prosecution subpoenaed no children, instead summoningofficers, reporters, the school's headmaster and teachers. Hunt,who was subpoenaed by Harvey, will testify Friday.   A Hunt spokeswoman, Stacy Rimer, said the governor made it plainto Harvey the day of the takeover that he had no power to grant apardon.   ``He always felt he did what was right because the lives of allthose students and teachers were at stake,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
