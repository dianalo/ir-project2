Swavely, president of the North American Divisionof Compaq Computer Corp., sees it.andP;  &quot;My understanding is that AS/400 salesare already trailing off,&quot; he says.andM;&quot;They have System/36 and 36 replacement business, where they got very quickacceptance in that base and moved many of those people very quickly.andP;  Butthey are not really getting into new accounts significantly,&quot; Swaveley says.andM;Beyond UpgradesandM;Compaq recently introduced the SystemPRO, which it has positioned directlyagainst midrange sytems like the AS/400.andP;  Still, few dispute the fact thatthe upgrade market is important to the aS/400's future.andP;  According to theCowen data, 211 of the machines that respondents plan to purchase--or ahealthy 25% of the total--will replace aging S/3X machines.andP;  That's evenconservative by IBM's reckoning.andP;  Fred Wiele, director of applicationbusiness systems marketing for IBM, believes the Cowen data underestimateboth the number S/3X midrange systems being replaced by the AS/400 and thenumber of competitors' systems.andM;&quot;Somewhere between 40 and 50% of our installations are migrations from ourinstalled System 36s and 38s.andP;  So, that is not incidental.andP;  It's a sourcethat's accelerating,&quot; Wiele says.andM;Wiele declines to specify the number of AS/400s that are replacingcompetitors' computers, but he says that the success rate is better thantwice the 3% the Cowen data indicate.andP;  ADM puts the number at 13%.andM;The Cowen data don't separate planned AS/400 purchases by the size ofcompanies, but IBM estimates that some 60% of the potential market formidrange multiuser computers is at small and intermediate-sized businesses.andO;&quot;Through the 1990s, that's a major market opportunity for us,&quot; says Wiele.andM;The Users' ReportandM;Woodson andamp; Bozeman Inc., a wholesale consumer electronics distributor inMemphis, represents both the small-business segment and companies migratingfrom a competitor's machine to the AS/400.andP;  Richard Murphy, vice presidentfor data processing, figures he's one of IBM's smallest customers.andP;  Hisexperience left him believing that IBM is taking small accounts seriously.andM;The company had been running its inventory contorl and accounting system on aUnisys Corp.B195 mainframe.andP;  After 10 years in operation, it needed to bereplaced.andP;  The price Unisys offered to upgrade Woodson to one of its A seriesmainframes was out of reach, Murphy says.andM;So, based on price alone, the company decided on an AS/400 model B35.andP;  Murphywas nervous.andP;  &quot;I'm like the typical non-IBM user.andP;  You hear all these horrorstories--that IBM will walk in and promise you the moon and then, when itcomes times to deliver, they won't deliver.&quot;andM;Keeping PromisesandM;But IBM delivered ahead of schedule, even arranging for two employees of alocal software house familiar with the AS/400 to step Murphy through theconversion.andP;  The system was up ahead of schedule.andP;  It handled the company'smonthly and quarterly accounting and inventory routines during the first fewweeks of operation, all without a hitch, according to Murphy.andM;Although Woodson andamp; Bozeman was attracted by IBM's favorable pricing, there isevidence to suggest there are fewer customers than IBM expected who aresimilarly willing to start out with low-cost systems.andP;  One surprise to comeout of the 1990 Cowen data was a steep increase over 1989 in the averageprice of AS/400 systems that respondents plan to install, from $239,000 to$479,000.andM;IBM has acknowledged that drift away from the low end.andP;  When analysts pointedout last year that sales in terms of raw numbers were disappointing, IBMcountered by claiming that because sales of high-end machines were betterthan expected, Big Blue met its revenue projections for the AS/400 anyway.andM;ADM has also tracked the trend.andP;  &quot;The upper-end models are just goingbonkers,&quot; says Dave Andrews, ADM's president.andP;  Based on numbers of unitssold, the AS/400 fell 40% below IBM's sales projections for 1989, accordingto Andrews.andP;  But, in terms of dollars, sales met projections because ofsuccess in the high end.andP;  &quot;The larger models are exllceeding their wildestdreams.andP;  One IBMer told me that the model 70 (the largest AS/400) passed thelifetime sales projection in its first three months.&quot;andM;ADM attributes that success to companies downsizing to the AS/400 frommainframe machines, a move that would require high-end AS/400s.andP;  ADM sentquestionnaires to 100 large IS shops with annual budgets ranging from $16million to $1.5 billion.andP;  Some 17% of those shops had already replacedmainframe applications with AS/400s, and another 28% planned to do so overthe next 18 months.andM;When One Is Not EnoughandM;Companies purchasing several, or even hundreds, of AS/400s account for alarge slice of survey respondents' midrange business.andP;  Averaged out, thenumber of planned purchases in the Cowen data equals roughtly one new AS/400for every three respondents.andP;  Actual sales, however, are far from evenlydistributed.andP;  Just two of the respondents surveyed by Cowen account for 33%of the total number of planned purchases.andP;  One company, an East Coastretailer, is installing 122 AS/400s.andP;  The other, a West Coast grocery chain,has 200 of the machines installed and is planning to add 150 over the nexttwo years.andP;  They aren't named here because the Cowen questionnaires areconsidered confidential.andM;The trend indicated by those two companies is real, however, says IBM'sWiele.andP;  &quot;About a quarter of our volumes last year came from multiples, largemultiple kinds of orders,&quot; Wiele says.andP;  &quot;We see it continuing into 1990.&quot;andM;The Deutsche Bundesbahn, West Germany's railway system, is another IBMcustomer buying the AS/400 in multiples.andP;  The railway started off with IBM'sSystem/36, installing 140 of them before the aS/400 was announced, saysVolker Kiene, chief of data processing.andM;The transition wasn't entirely smooth, says Kiene.andP;  The railway had alreadybegun building a payroll application on the 36s.andP;  Porting the software to theAS/400s was difficult.andP;  Working with IBM, it took a full year to port some40,000 lines of code.andM;The software problems haven't stopped the Bundesbahn from pushing ahead withplans for a network of AS/400s.andP;  Some 600 will be installed by year's end.andO;After two years, the full network of 750 machines is expected to beoperational.andP;  Once complete, the network will control the payroll of 240,000employees.andM;Plans call for connecitng the AS/400s through a mainframe at the railway'sheadquarters in Frankfurt, using IBM's Systems Network Architecture (SNA).andO;Eventually, the railway plans to add dispatching systems to controlassignment of engines and a fleet of trucks, plus an inventory system forspare parts used in maintenance of the tracks and rolling stock.andM;At Canada Housing and Mortgage Corp., the IS staff took a similar track,starting to develop their office automation and electronic mail system with afew S/36 machines and converting in the middle of development when the AS/400became available.andP;  Now some 60 AS/400s, ranging from model B20s to B60s, andmore than 1,600 PS/2s link all 60 offices and 3,000 employees at theOttawa-based government agency, which administers housing policy in Canada.andO;Its offices include remote locations like Whitehorse in the Yukon Territoryand Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories.andM;Installing the nationwide system proved to be a difficult task, says BillRowe, director of technical planning and support.andP;  &quot;When we got it, it was anew box, and it was new in Canada.andP;  So, we lived through every bit oftrouble,&quot; Rowe says.andP;  With heavy assistance from IBM, the network wascompleted in December.andP;  &quot;It took us until this year to get things pretty wellunder control,&quot; he adds.andM;&quot;As you are installing system this size, you sort of steamroll oer theproblems.andP;  When you come out of the tunnel at the end, you've got to dealwith all of the debris that you're left lying around,&quot; Rowe says.andP;  &quot;We had asmany software problems as we could possibly have imagined we could have withthe 400.&quot;andM;Still, the $20 million system is viewed as a success.andP;  &quot;Despite what thetechnicians and support staff have been through, users are pretty welluniformly delighted with the system,&quot; Rowe says.andP;  Employees, for example,were quick to shift from telephone calls to an electronic mail system on theAS/400 to transfer data, messages and documents.andM;An Open DebateandM;It's difficult to say exactly what the success of the AS/400 says about themove toward open systems.andM;According to IBM's Wiele, the open systems trend has probably been overhyped.andO;AS/400 customers want the commercial applications, the integrated databaseand the large pool of trained programmers that just aren't currentlyavailable in the UNIX world, he says.andM;At Canada Mortgage and Housing, the proprietary nature of the AS/400 isn't anissue because the agency isn't writing any custom code to run on the AS/400network.andP;  It's used strictly for packaged electronic mail and officeautomation applications.andP;  &quot;Our applications run either on the mainframe orthey run on PC LANs in the office.andP;  So, we're ot tied to the AS/400 any morethan we're tied to the word processor,&quot; says Rowe.andM;To replace about 50 S/36s used in its drug and pharmaceutical division,McKesson Corp., the San Francisco-based consumer products distributor, isevaluating both the AS/400s and Tandem Computers Inc.'s CLX systems, anotherproprietary machine.andP;  The issue of open systems never came up, says RickSierra, manager of distributed systems for McKesson.andP;  Freedom from vendorscan come at a cost: a shift in responsibility for support and maintenancefrom the vendor to the user.andP;  &quot;We were more concerned about vendor support ofthe operating system, rather than us supporting the operating system,&quot; hesays.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
