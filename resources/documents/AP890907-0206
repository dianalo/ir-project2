The plant being mothballed is at the Savannah River site in SouthCarolina, where some 600 afffected employees will be absorbed intoother projects.   The only other plant producing fuel for reactors that drivenuclear powered warships is operated by Nuclear Fuel Services Inc.at Erwin, Tenn. The department said the Erwin plant could supply theNavy's entire needs.   ``The projected demand for fuel no longer justifies the cost ofoperating two facilities,'' the department said in a statement.   Several reasons were given for reduced demand, among them:   _Reactor core design and manufacturing are getting better,permitting cores to last longer and reducing the need for refueling,and reducing the amount of fuel needed for a core in the first place.   _The Navy has reduced its projected building plans fornuclear-powered warships.</TEXT></DOC>
