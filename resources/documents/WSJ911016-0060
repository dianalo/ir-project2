The baby's birth neared. Slouched in the passengerseat of her husband's Chevy, she searched desperately forhelp said to be near a &quot;golden rainbow.&quot;   Mrs. Calderon, lost in a strange town, began to sob asnight fell. Through a film of tears, she finally glimpsed thepromised rainbow -- a tall pair of electric golden archessymbolizing a famous American fast-food chain, the Calderonslearned later. Next to the arches squatted the tiny whitehouse of the &quot;partera,&quot; or lay midwife.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;When I saw the partera's house I knew my trip wasworthwhile,&quot; Mrs. Calderon said later. &quot;My son would be bornan American citizen.&quot;   Maternity and migration are universal facts of life, butonly along this border between the First World and the ThirdWorld do they come together in the peculiar occupation ofpartera. The 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution conferscitizenship on anyone born within the geographical limits ofthe U.S. whether the mother has been in the country 30 yearsor 30 seconds. This law confers important status on parteras,Mexican-American matrons whose offices are as common as pesoexchange stands and package liquor stores along this2,000-mile frontier.   &quot;Mexicans who can't afford American immigration lawyersafter their kids are born, go to American parteras beforetheir kids are born,&quot; says Margarita Tagle, an anthropologyresearcher at Texas Aandamp;I University. She counts 140 parteras,about one per mile, on the stretch of border betweenBrownsville and Laredo, Texas. Some of their patients areMexican-Americans who can't afford doctors, but most areupwardly-mobile Mexicans.   From her well-known post alongside the U.S.'s southernmostMcDonald's, Margarita Garcia has served hundreds of Mexicansas midwife over 16 years. Some mothers-to-be, lacking visas,have come to Mrs. Garcia still soaked from wading the RioGrande. Once, Mrs. Garcia recalls, she was halfway through adelivery when another woman in labor appeared on herdoorstep. Moments later, a third woman came to give birth.The partera delivered all three of the babies. &quot;Faster thanSpeedy Gonzalez,&quot; boasts Mrs. Garcia, who is as brown andbroad as an adobe wall.   On a sweltering summer day Mrs. Garcia's tiny parlor ispacked with 15 pregnant Mexicans taking lessons in prenatalcare from a nurse. Mrs. Garcia squeezes through the crowd andexits out the front door to upbraid a double-parked motorist.She returns to the doorway 10 minutes later to find that moremothers-to-be have arrived. So many more, in fact, thatthere's no room in Mrs. Garcia's house for Mrs. Garcia.&quot;Business is very good,&quot; she says, waiting outside in theshade of a plantain tree.   The parteras are widely considered to have mystical powersin this culture where maternal figures are worshipped.Mexico's patron saint is the Virgin of Guadalupe and Mother'sDay is celebrated almost as fervidly as Christmas. Duringlast summer's solar eclipse, many parteras warned patientsthat evil would befall them if they so much as left home. Onepartera in La Joya, Texas, posted a sign decorated with ascowling sun; it read, &quot;No Open. Eclipse.&quot;   The parteras, who charge $200 to $700 per delivery, areregarded as nuisances by some north of the border.Immigration officials find that some midwives supply theblack market with blank birth certificates. Doctors complainthat the women are poorly trained. (The parteras say theircare is better than what's offered in Mexico, and whencomplications arise they call an ambulance.) Hospitals saythat they attract indigent Mexicans to emergency rooms.   A landmark 1981 legal case arose when Maria Carmen Ordunezcouldn't find a partera in her hour of need and was forced todrop in at a Laredo hospital. When orderlies found out Mrs.Ordunez was a Mexican citizen, they hustled her into anambulance headed for Mexico. Mrs. Ordunez gave birth in theambulance before it could arrive at a Mexican hospital. Aidedby U.S. civil rights activists, Mrs. Ordunez sued thehospital and won damages. Money couldn't buy U.S. citizenshipfor her child, however. It seems that the baby emerged fromher womb when the ambulance rested on Mexico's half of theinternational bridge.   The parteras chafe at criticism of their profession, asthough motherhood itself were coming under attack. &quot;You cannever make some people happy,&quot; complains grandmotherlyJosefina Rangel, her face assuming the kind of painedexpression that might be directed at a dinner guest whodidn't clean his plate. &quot;What is the problem, as long as weare helping people and not breaking any laws?&quot; Mrs. Rangelspeaks of the legality of her practice with some authority.She checked with her son, who is an agent with the U.S.Immigration Service.   For Mexican mothers-to-be, the dash to the &quot;parteras&quot; isworthwhile if it means their offspring will cut the cord withThird World poverty. &quot;I want my child to have an easier lifethan I do,&quot; says Lupita Ruiz, a 20-year-old due to deliver.She is washing a tub of clothes in her home in a workingclass barrio in Matamoros, across the border fromBrownsville. A thunderstorm has just rolled in and the waterin front of her house is shin deep. &quot;It's probably simplercrossing the river than my street,&quot; she sighs, nodding towardthe Rio Grande.   For Mrs. Ruiz and her husband, a handyman, paying for thepartera has demanded great economic sacrifice. They've beensetting aside a little money each month. &quot;We have enoughmoney saved -- unless I give the partera twice the work,&quot; shesays. It seems that twins run in the Ruiz family.   The motives of parteras tend to be more complex than thoseof their clients. Empathy for displaced persons made amidwife of Carmen Rodriguez, born in Spain during a time ofmilitary dictatorship. Her family escaped the country byposing as a trapeze act and joining a circus headed forAmerica.   Mrs. Rodriguez, now in her 60s, has brought severalthousand citizens to the New World herself in four decades asa partera. None meant more to her than the boy she deliveredten months ago. It was December when his mother showed up onMrs. Rodriguez's doorstep. She had no husband, no job and nodesire to keep her baby. Mrs. Rodriguez agreed to make thedelivery without charge. Then she made arrangements to adoptthe child. Today, Mrs. Rodriguez dandles her 10-month-oldson, who is fat, brawling and almond-eyed. &quot;What other jobwould give me such satisfaction?&quot; she asks.   These rewards often come to the parteras at the expense oftheir rest. Mrs. Garcia is awakened recently at 3 a.m. by acar swerving onto the curb and rattling her badly bentchain-link fence. &quot;I know what that sound means,&quot; Ms. Garciasays.   Out of the auto lumbers Cecilia Salazar, stooped over andsoon to give birth. Moving briskly, Ms. Garcia sets Mrs.Salazar on a bed and scrubs up.   Mrs. Garcia puts one hand on Mrs. Salazar's stomach, andthe other hand between her patient's thighs. As the baby'sslick black crown emerges, Mrs. Salazar begins to flop on themattress. &quot;No bailes,&quot; sighs Ms. Garcia. Don't dance.   Mrs. Salazar moans and her mother murmurs the &quot;Hail Mary&quot;in the next room. &quot;Empuja,&quot; Mrs. Garcia shouts. Push.   Mrs. Salazar begins to push. Slowly the baby's neck slidesout, followed by the torso and then legs. It's a girl.   The newborn's face is screwed up in an expression that isinconsolably sour. &quot;You liked it better inside, no?&quot; Mrs.Garcia asks, as she turns the infant's buttocks upward. Thenthe partera draws back the palm of her hand and, with more acaress than a slap, welcomes the baby to America.</TEXT></DOC>
