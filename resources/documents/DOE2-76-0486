Thebasic requirements for high-quality 3D reformations are an absence ofpatient movement and narrow-width transaxial sections. Speed of examinationis an important factor in optimizing image quality. One hundred examinationswere performed on an IGE CT 9800 scanner. For bone studies, 80 mAs and,for certain soft tissues, 140 or 200 mAs were employed with 120 kVp.The advantages of such a ''low-dose'' technique are significant reductionin patient skin dose and a faster examination. The main disadvantageis a reduction in signal-to-noise ratio. The image quality obtained in3D presentations has nevertheless been sufficient to enable all bonyabnormalities to be identified. Three-dimensional examinations are nowbeing performed routinely using a dynamic mode and this ''low-dose''technique.</TEXT></DOC>
