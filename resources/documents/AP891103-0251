Earlier, rumors of an alleged insider-trading scandal involvinga Cabinet minister shook the London stock market. TransportSecretary Cecil Parkinson denied speculation Thursday he wasinvolved and the markets steadied.   But the jittery reaction reflected edginess about thegovernment, already shaken by last week's resignation of the toptreasury official, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. Hequit in a policy dispute with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher overEurope.   The new chancellor, John Major, issued a government paper layingdown what he termed Britain's ``market-based'' approach to thedevelopment of economic and monetary union among the 12 nations ofthe EEC.   The British plan said it was ``far too early'' to commit the EECto having a single currency and central bank envisioned in thecurrent plan, drawn up by Jacques Delors, head of the EuropeanCommission at the Community's headquarters in Brussels.   French President Francois Mitterrand, president of the 12-nationEEC, is pressing the Delors plan.   Last month, Mitterrand went further and said economic andmonetary union would be a decisive step toward ``achieving apolitical unity of the community.''   The British plan left open what may happen in the longer termabout economic and monetary union.   It said London's approach was based on general principles thatmarket forces, not new Europe-wide institutions, should prevail,and that decisions should be taken at European level only when theycannot be taken by national governments.   ``It is an excellent paper,'' Mrs. Thatcher told the House ofCommons.   It ``shows you can achieve closer economic and monetarycooperation much better and more rapidly by working with the grainof market forces than by setting up new bureaucratic and highlycentralized institutions which are not accountable to anybody,''she added.   Mrs. Thatcher in June rejected the single central bank andone-currency notions as removing from national governmentsfundamental powers to decide on economic policy.   Mrs. Thatcher agreed, however, on strict conditions that Britainwill in principle join the currency-stabilizing mechanism of theEuropean Monetary System that links nine of the EEC currencies.   But she is unenthusiastic about the idea, while Lawson wanted tojoin as soon as possible. He quit saying he could no longer carryon while Mrs. Thatcher retained a personal economic adviser whoopposes British membership. The adviser then also resigned.   London share prices tumbled in early trading after rumors sweptthe market that another Cabinet minister was likely to resign inthe alleged insider-dealing scandal.   After several hours of speculation that Parkinson was theminister, he issued a statement through his lawyers saying he hasnot ``engaged in any insider dealing nor in any share dealings.''   The statement added that Parkinson transferred his funds tostockbrokers after he joined the Cabinet in 1987 and had since``played no part whatsoever'' in any investments the brokers made.   The rumors began after The Scotsman, a newspaper based inEdinburgh, Scotland, reported that Britain's Channel 4 televisionnetwork has investigated an insider-dealing group that allegedlyhas at least one senior government member among its clients.   Channel 4 confirmed it is working on an investigation but saidthe program was ``as yet neither complete nor scheduled.''   Insider trading is the illegal attempt to profit by buying andselling stock based on inside information about a company, such astakeover offers or profits prospects, which is not available to thepublic.</TEXT></DOC>
