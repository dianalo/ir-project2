FRAZIER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The opposition closed itspresidential campaign with some supporters predicting victory inSunday's vote over the handpicked candidate of Gen. Manuel AntonioNoriega _ or bloodshed.   ``Count the votes or count the dead,'' read one of theopposition coalition's signs Wednesday at a rally attended by100,000 flag-waving people on Via Espana in downtown Panama City.   President Bush, opposition candidates and others predict thatNoriega, the Defense Forces chief and Panama's de facto ruler, willsteal the elections. The government promises clean elections.   Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara said that ifthe public will is denied through vote-rigging, ``Panamanians willmarch in defense of liberty.''   Never again, Endara said in reference to Noriega, ``will thewill of one man be above the will of the Panamanian people.''   The opposition candidates say there is no hope of democracy inPanama as long as Noriega, indicted in Florida last year on chargesof drug smuggling and money laundering, remains in power. Noriegahas denied the charges.   Opposition supporters snake-danced through the crowd Wednesdaynight with a black coffin pasted with a smiling picture of Noriegaand a pineapple attached atop. ``Pineapple face,'' a derogatoryname the opposition uses for Noriega, refers to his roughcomplexion.   The pro-government coalition closes its presidential campaigntonight with a rally. Its ticket is headed by Carlos Duque Jaen, aclose business associate of Noriega.   The central issue of the campaign has been Noriega, and notPanama's protracted economic and social problems.   The opposition contends government workers, representing about20 percent of the labor force, are being pressured by Noriegaforces to attend the rally tonight and that the government willtruck thousands into the capital to swell the ranks.   On Sunday, voters will choose a president, two vice presidents,67 national legislators and 510 precinct representatives.   Panama has about 2.2 million people and about 1.2 millionregistered voters. At a news conference Wednesday, secondopposition vice presidential candidate Guillermo Ford said Sunday'svote ``is the last peaceful opportunity for change.''   Said first vice presidential candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon,``There are thousands here who have never known liberty but arehere to fight for it.''   Added Ford, ``I was born free. I am not free. I will be free onMay 7.''   Rivers of people carrying colorful party flags poured into therally area Wednesday.   Fireworks burst in the muggy air overhead and enthusiasticopposition supporters fueled a street fire with pro-governmentcandidates' flags pulled from trees and lampposts.   Speeches by Ford and Endara were broken up, once when the crowdpanicked after opposition security guards moved in on peopleincluding some journalists trying to climb a fence protecting thecandidates.   At least one person was carried from the stampede but did notappear to be seriously injured. Others were knocked to the groundbut walked away without assistance.   There was more panic when opposition supporters identified analleged government informer, or ``toad'' and chased him through thecrowd, beating him with sticks until he escaped.   Many signs at the rally addressed the issue of vote rigging.   Arias said a 29 percent jump in voter rolls since the 1984elections was ``unexplainable.'' In the same period, there has beenonly a 16 percent increase in population.   The opposition contends the difference represents duplicatevoting cards and other measures issued to give pro-governmentcandidates an edge. Government officials say the increase is theresult of improved registration methods.   After Noriega was indicted, then-President Eric Arturo Delvalletried to oust him but the general forced out Delvalle.   Noriega and the government accuse the opposition of beinglackeys of the United States, which has imposed economic sanctionson Panama as part of its attempt to drive him from power.   Noriega says the United States is trying to get rid of him aspart of a plan to retain control of the Panama Canal.   According to a 1977 treaty, the United States is to turn thewaterway over to local control in the year 2000 and remove its12,000 military personnel from Panama.   Among the observers expected Sunday are former presidents JimmyCarter, who signed the treaty, and Gerald Ford. They are part of anunofficial U.S. delegation invited by the Panamanian government.   The government has rejected any official U.S. delegation.</TEXT></DOC>
