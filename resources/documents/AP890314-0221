Critics say the nuclear era should be ended in the 1990s to avoidunnecessary financial and safety risks. Supporters say the industrymust be rejuvenated to preserve an alternative to growing dependenceon fossil fuels such as oil.   Increasingly, people on both sides are suggesting that unless acomeback is started soon, the industry will degenerate to the pointof no return. Suppliers of nuclear plant components already aredropping out of the business and the pool of university-trainednuclear engineers is shrinking.   ``It does atrophy, and it is more serious than it might seem,''said Larry Hobart, executive director of the American Public PowerAssociation, a Washington-based trade group representing publiclyowned utilities, many of which rely on nuclear power.   Whatever the long-range outcome, few believe atomic power willcontribute much, if anything, to the added generating capacity thatexperts say will be needed over the next decade to meet the nation'sgrowing appetite for electricity.   No new nuclear plants have been ordered since 1978. All thoseordered after 1974 have been canceled, and experts say morecancellations are almost certain.   The question now is: Will another nuclear plant ever be built inthis country?   ``The major barriers are still there,'' said Alan T. Crane, whodirected an Office of Technology Assessment report on nuclear powerthat said major changes in technology, utility management and publicacceptance of nuclear power were needed before the industry couldexpect to expand in the 21st century.   A ripple of encouragement is spreading through the industry asmore public attention is focused on environmental problemsassociated with the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal.Gases from these fuels create a ``greenhouse effect'' that somescientists say is causing a dangerous warming of the Earth.   Industry officials say nuclear energy is more environmentallysound than fossil fuels and can reduce the U.S. reliance on foreignoil.   Nuclear foes respond, however, that relatively few power plantsrun on oil. They say it would be wiser to address to improve energyefficiency, increase conservation, pursue ways to burn coal morecleanly and use more renewable energy sources such as solar andhydropower.   President Bush says a national energy policy must include areliance on nuclear power, and his support is reflected in thechoice of James D. Watkins as energy secretary. Watkins hadextensive experience in the Navy's nuclear reactor program.   ``We need nuclear power,'' Bush said at Watkins' swearing-inMarch 9.   In seeking to win public favor for renewed nuclear activity, theindustry asserts that since the partial meltdown of a reactor atThree Mile Island on March 28, 1979, nuclear plants have becomesafer and more efficient. They note that last year, for the firsttime, nuclear plants supplied 20 percent of the nation'selectricity, and say that the average dose of radiation per plantworker has decreased.   There have been many accidental releases of minor amounts ofradioactivity into the air from nuclear plants since Three MileIsland, but it is not just the reactors that have hurt theindustry's image. One of the most troubling incidents was at thePeach Bottom plant, near Delta, Pa., which was shut down by thegovernment in March 1987 because control room workers were caughtsleeping on the job.   Industry officials insist the country is better off with anetwork of reactors that can help meet electricity needs throughoutthe 1990s. But even the biggest boosters acknowledge the futureoutlook is clouded.   ``I don't anticipate that we will order any new nuclear plants inthis century, and in my judgment nobody else will either,'' saidWilliam W. Berry, chairman of Virginia Power, an electric utilitythat runs four nuclear plants.   Virginia Power canceled four planned nuclear reactors, startingin 1977, initially because of doubts about the need for theadditional power capacity. But recently, with electricity demandrising rapidly in its service area, the utility faced a choice:build some new plants or buy power from other suppliers. In a movethat may point to a new trend, it decided to take the latter path.   Berry and other industry executives, as well as governmentregulators, environmentalists and independent analysts, said ininterviews that the reasons for the nuclear downfall are simple: toocostly, too risky, too little public acceptance.   Industry leaders say federal regulators also are to blame,although others disagree.   The Three Mile Island emergency, which was caused in part byhuman error, galvanized public concern about the safety of nuclearpower. The seeds of trouble, however, were sown earlier in thedecade with a decline in the growth of energy demand.   Plant cancellations spread as utilities realized their plans weretoo ambitious for an era in which consumers were learning to get bywith less energy. Since the first cancellation in 1972, the scratchlist has grown to 108 _ exactly equal to the number of plants nowlicensed to operate at full power.   When the tide of energy demand began turning in the mid-1980s andutilities foresaw a need to expand their generating capacity, itbecame apparent that public fears about nuclear safety _ not justeconomics _ were a major obstacle.   ``The American people still don't have any trust in the safety ofnuclear power,'' Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said at a recentconference of state energy officials.   Though the trust began eroding after the Three Mile Islandincident, many experts believe that even more devastating was thereactor explosion and fire at Chernobyl in the Soviet Ukraine inwhich 31 people were killed by radiation exposure.   Lester R. Brown, president of the Washington-based WorldwatchInstitute, wrote in a report last month that Chernobyl ``did whathundreds of studies assessing nuclear technology could never havedone: it made the dangers of nuclear power real.''   U.S. industry officials say a catastrophe on the scale ofChernobyl could not happen in this country because American reactorsare designed much differently. Critics say the Soviet accidentpoints up the unpredictability of nuclear power.   An Associated Press-Media General poll conducted in January foundsupport for continued use of nuclear plants now operating, but onlya third of those queried supported building more. One-half said aserious nuclear accident was likely in the future, and 79 percentsaid nuclear safety rules should be more tightly enforced.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
