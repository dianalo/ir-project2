In the burgeoning cottage industry of books explaining whyit's no longer &quot;A Wonderful Life&quot; in Bedford Falls, MartinLowy, a veteran attorney, bank regulator and savings-and-loandirector manages to blow away most of the smoke and look pastthe mirrors concealing the fundamental causes of amulti-decade thrift mess that will cost taxpayers at least$200 billion.</LP><TEXT>   In detective Lowy's no-nonsense analytical investigationof this fiscal whodunit, &quot;High Rollers: Inside the Savingsand Loan Debacle&quot; (Praeger, 321 pages, $24.95), he concludesthat &quot;The Market Did It.&quot; Playing supporting roles, ofcourse, was a ragtag cast of inept regulators, myopicpoliticians and desperate thrift operators relying on phonyaccounting tricks and dancing to the siren song of a runawaydeposit-insurance system that kept refilling the coffers ofbusted Sandamp;Ls and holding taxpayers hostage.   Unlike the majority of Sandamp;L literary gumshoes who peddleemotionally rousing but diversionary tales of fraud, greedand criminal conspiracy, Mr. Lowy is almost always on targetin zeroing in on the fundamental economic factors behind thelong collective funeral march for Sandamp;Ls. His cool analysismakes clear that the essential structure of the politicallycreated thrift system was fatally flawed. Once the highinflation and interest-rate volatility of the 1970s and early1980s combined to expose the fatal maturity mismatches intraditional thrift balance sheets, most of the industry wason borrowed time (and, unfortunately, on implicitly borrowedtaxpayer money).   What further aggravated these sunk losses frominterest-rate imbalances in most Sandamp;Ls, however, was thepolitical and regulatory systems' unwillingness to cut theirlosses, call in the pallbearers and move on. Instead, majoreffort went into concealing the fact that FSLIC (the thrifts'insurer) really was broke. This attempt to preserve publicconfidence in the deposit-insurance contract resulted in adisastrous series of accounting games, regulatoryforbearances and delayed closure decisions that ultimatelymagnified the size and scope of the original disaster.   When the regulatory &quot;counters&quot; of capital and solvencylost their ability to keep count, not only were members ofCongress, the media and the public lulled into a(notunwelcome) false sense of security. This politicalblindfolding of true market signals also created perverseincentives for dozens of con men and greedy hustlers to takeoff on speculative lending sprees in real estate that, underdistorted accounting rules, looked profitable on paper in theshort term but actually ran up incredible long-term losses.   Mr. Lowy swims against the tide of conventional wisdom inreviewing the regulatory reigns of the past decade's threeFederal Home Loan Bank Board chairmen. He is generous to DickPratt (1981-1983), who was &quot;in a box&quot; without Reagan TreasuryDepartment support for a cash bailout of FSLIC. Nevertheless,it was the too-clever Mr. Pratt who improvised cashsubstitutes to resolve thrift failure by rigging theaccounting rules. His short-term expediency came back tohaunt others less aware of the industry's underlyingpredicament.   Mr. Lowy instead skewers Ed Gray (1983-1987), who hasotherwise successfully reinvented his persona as the Diogenesof thrift regulators since leaving office. Mr. Lowy portraysMr. Gray as a thin-skinned, hapless administrator who knewlittle of substance but, as a former public-relations man,apparently chanted the Andre Agassi mantra: &quot;Image iseverything.&quot;   More puzzling is Mr. Lowy's kid-gloves treatment of DannyWall (1987-1990) as a &quot;good guy&quot; and &quot;scapegoat&quot; who tried tomake thrift resolution deals with his hands tied by Congress.Fair enough, but that ignores an incredible lack of basiccompetence on Mr. Wall's part (Lincoln, Silverado, theSouthwest Plan and a bit of a problem with numbers).   What Mr. Lowy does superbly is demolish the myths andmisconceptions served up as significant factors in creatingthe thrift mess: fraud, liberalized asset powers,interest-rate deregulation and junk bonds. He reminds us thatuntil the 1989 FIRREA legislation forced thrifts to unloadtheir bonds in a thin and volatile market, high-yield &quot;junk&quot;constituted the second most profitable investment for thehandful of Sandamp;Ls that actually owned them. When FIRREA ineffect destroyed both the market maker (Drexel) and themarket for junk bonds in a misguided search for adiversionary bogeyman, Congress also set in motion a panickydomino effect. The resulting taxpayer losses of $3 billion to$4 billion were largely avoidable.   Mr. Lowy does a fine job of explaining how the secondarymortgage market (subsidized by implicit governmentguarantees) has in effect doomed most thrifts' chances forprofitability. He also illustrates how a bankrupt Sandamp;L isdoomed to lose money forever (until closed). So it is fairlysad to find his ultimate policy prescriptions flabby,indecisive and, at times, plain wrong.   Unfortunately, the old regulator has a soft spot for smallthrifts and banks as human institutions. After muchhand-wringing and too much two-handed economics (on the onehand, on the other hand), Mr. Lowy ultimately treats everyoneexcept his kind of regulators as helpless, disparages greaterreliance on market discipline, and prefers to largely muddlealong with a chastened status quo -- as long as regulatorshave unlimited access to deposit-insurance funding.   Well, several hundreds of billions of dollars later, thatjust won't do. Surely it is time to roll back the extravagantsubsidies and protections against loss for sophisticatedinvestor/depositors through mandatory &quot;haircuts,&quot;co-insurance and greater information disclosure. Right now,taxpayers remain conscripted as hostages to one-sidedfinancial risk taking.   ---   Mr. Miller is senior policy analyst at the CompetitiveEnterprise Institute in Washington, D.C.</TEXT></DOC>
