Timberlake Jr. is back at his stand, again blasting the Federal Reserve for its nefarious schemes to inflate the money supply and the price level.    &quot;Monetary Policy's Payoff to the Treasury&quot; (editorial page, Dec. 22) tells us that increases in the real value of the monetary base over the past 20 years belong to the private sector ($3.7 billion), while increases in the real stock of base money created by the Fed have accrued to the government ($80.2 billion).    It is true enough that inflation is a tax that the private sector pays for government goods and services. It could be argued that people know that when they lobby for government goods and lobby against tax assessments, inflation is the tax they must pay. Isn't that consistent with rational-expectations theory? The theory tells us that the common folk understand the government's policy rules. So I would add the public, along with the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, to Prof. Timberlake's list of sinners.    One suspects that it is not the conduct of monetary policy that starts Prof. Timberlake's chaffing. What he really wants is to abolish the Fed because it has too much discretion for policy-making. Never mind that people may choose their elected representatives for their political skill in achieving this or that appropriation or bringing pressure to bear on the Fed to lower interest rates. The political Timberlake doesn't like to see the public sector enhanced and he sees the Fed as an instrument for public-sector growth.    Why do we suspect that Prof. Timberlake's argument is political? Because he always points the finger at the government as the guilty borrower. In fact, the private sector borrows, too. The financial markets cry out for Federal Reserve money and credit growth just as loudly when homebuilders finance their deficits as when the Treasury finances its deficit.    The old Timberlake (his money and banking text, 1972, p.608) told us that &quot;Nonpolitical monetary policy is not only a contradiction in terms, it is not possible and it is not desirable.&quot;    Now, writing in the Cato Journal (Winter 1986), the new Timberlake calls the Federal Reserve Banks, &quot;Superfluous facades for the creation of base money.&quot; He recommends that &quot;. . . all the Federal Reserve Banks, branches, research centers, and appurtenances should be completely divorced from the government and placed in the hands of their stockholders (member banks).&quot;    Politics is politics, Prof. Timberlake. Give us a break.    Prof. William B. Harrison   Virginia Commonwealth University   Richmond, Va.</TEXT></DOC>
