(TCI) brought itsCommUnity family of network products to the Mac.andP;  In addition to its otherfeatures, CommUnity-Mac allows the Mac to communicate with any other hardwareplatform running CommUnity.andM;TCI's CommUnity-Mac can work asynchronously (by direct RS-232-C connection orover a modem), or it can make the Mac a non-routing end node in a Phase IVDECnet network over Ethernet.andM;Now the company has developed a new version of CommUnity-Mac: version 1.3.andO;(For DR Labs' first review of CommUnity-Mac, see &quot;CommUnity: The OriginalDECnet Clone,&quot; Digital Review, Feb. 8, 1988, page 83.)andM;The most significant change that TCI has made in version 1.3 is the additionof a file access listener (FAL).andP;  The FAL is a Mac INIT resource that listensfor requests from remote nodes to access files on the Mac.andP;  (INITs are smallprograms that are loaded into the Mac's RAM at boot time and remain residentthere while the Mac is running.)andP;  TCI has also enhanced many other aspects ofCommUnity-Mac and has added support for additional Ethernet cards.andM;DR Labs tested CommUnity-Mac version 1.3 on a Macintosh II with 4MB of RAMand a 100MB Rodime disk drive.andP;  The Mac was connected to DR NEt, DR Labs'Ethernet network, with an EtherPort II card from Kinetics.andP;  CommUnity-Mac'sfile server software was installed on a MicroVAX II that had 16MB of memory,a DEC RD54 system disk and a CDC XMD II SMD-E disk drive connected with anEMulex QD33 controller.andP;  The MicroVAX was connected to DR Net using a DECDEQNA controller.andM;CommUnity-Mac version 1.3 retains many of the characteristics of previousversions.andP;  For example, its Mail utility and its implementation of PacerSoftware's terminal emulator--which is layered on top of DECnet's CTERMremote terminal protocol--remain virtually unchanged.andM;Also, CommUnity-Mac still can support only 50 nodes in its networkdatabase--a serious limitation for large sites, and one that has not beenaddressed since the product was released.andM;But the Remote File Access application, the Network Database Editor and theCommUnity desk accessory have all been given a facelift.andM;The new release of CommUnity-Mac continues to support asynchronouscommunications using the DDCMP protocol and now supports nearly every majorEthernet card on the market: cards from Kinetics, 3Com and Apple, as well asthe FastNet (but not the FastNet III) from Dove Computer.andP;  This is good newsfor file server users because it lets them choose faster cards than theFastNet, which had been the only card supported by CommUnity-Mac until now.andM;Besides TCI's VAX-based file server software, CommUnity-Mac works with DEC'sPersonal Computer File Server (PCFS) software, which is bundled with DECnet,which in turn is bundled with VMS.andM;The file server has undergone three major changes since version 1.0 wasreleased.andP;  First, it now supports the automatic mounting of remote disks(virtual Mac disks stored on the VAX).andP;  Second, it can store remote diskparameter information on the Mac's local disk.andP;  This means that the user doesnot have to enter any information about a remote disk's parameters in orderto mount it; the information is called up from where it is stored on theuser's Mac disk.andP;  Third, multiple users can simultaneously access the sameVMS directory and files on the file server.andM;But perhaps the most significant change in CommUnity-Mac is the addition of aFAL to give VAX users access to Mac-based files.andP;  Here TCI is finallycatching up with competing Mac-VAX connectivity vendors such as ThursbySoftware Systems, whose TSSnet product has had a FAL for nearly two years.andM;* SHOOT FROM THE MACandM;All of CommUnity-Mac's software, including the VA -based file serversoftware, is installed from the Macintosh.andM;First, users run the copy of Apple's Installer program provided by TCI on thefirst of four CommUnity-Mac distribution diskettes, the System diskette.andO;(The other three are the Applications, File Server and Images diskettes.)andM;Installer presents users with a dialog box listing the five Ethernet cardsthat CommUnity-Mac supports.andP;  Users select a card from this list and clickthe dialog box's Install button, which causes Installer to install theappropriate version of CommUnity-Mac software on the Mac.andP;  Installer alsoadds the CommUnity desk accessory to the Mac's System file at this time.andM;Users then reboot the Mac from its hard disk, copy the folder named&quot;CommUnity Folder&quot; with all its files from the CommUnity-Mac Applicationsdiskette to the Mac's root directory, then copy the Ethernet card driverfiles from the Images diskette into this same folder on the Mac.andM;For CommUnity-Mac to function properly, the CommUnity folder must remain inthe Mac's root directory, and neither it nor any of the files it containsshould be renamed.andM;This folder contains all of CommUnity-Mac's utilities, including Mail, RemoteFile Access and Terminal Emulator.andP;  It also contains the FAL, the NetworkDatafile and the Ethernet card driver software.andM;Next, users employ TCI's Network Database Editor (NDE) to create a networkdatabase, which associates each node's name with its Ethernet area, nodenumber and other information that CommUnity-Mac will use to access it.andM;Unfortunately, this database is limited to 50 node definitions.andP;  Nodes notlisted in the database must be specified by cumbersome area and node numberreferences in order to be accessed.andP;  By comparison, TSSnet's Network Datafile can supportas many nodes as DECnet itself: 63 areas with as many as1,023 nodes each.andM;The NDE is also used to enter the validation code that each copy ofCommUnity-Mac needs to operate.andP;  Each time CommUnity-Mac seeks to accessthenetwork, it submits this code to the network.andP;  Only valid codes are grantedaccess to the network, and if two Macs are running copies of CommUnity-Macwith the same code, only one will be able to access the network at a time.andM;Other information that users enter into the network database with NDE includethe type of server software running on remote hosts, the username and(optionally) password that the user's Mac will use to access VAX-based fileservers, the type of Ethernet card in the user's Mac, and the username andpassword by which the Mac will be identified for Mail and network calls.andM;Once all this information is entered into the network database, users reboottheir Mac and run the CommUnity Diagnostics to see if the installation wassuccessful.andP;  If it was, users can install TCI's file server software onto theVAX.andM;This software is in the form of three files--TFAS.TXT, TFAS.COM andTFAS.EXE--on the CommUnity Images diskette.andP;  Users run CommUnity-Mac's RemoteFile Access application to copy all three files from the Mac to auser-specified directory on the VAX.andM;Remote File Access offers three protocols for file transfers: text, verbatimand MacBinary.andP;  The files TFAS.TXT and TFAS.COM, being text files, should betransferred to the VAX using the text protocol.andP;  TFAS.EXE, a binaryexecutable image, should be transferred using the verbatim protocol.andM;Then users start up the TFAS server by logging in to the VAX to which thethree file server files were copied and executing the TFAS.COM command filewith the command @TFAS [nnn], where [nnn] is a number that will become thenetwork object number for that VAX's file server process.andM;Unlike the AlisaShare file server from Alisa Systems, the TCI server does notuse a VAX-based file to specify what directories the Macs will use as fileservers.andP;  All file server information is kept on the Mac in the networkdatabase.andM;Once the file server has been started on the VAX and its definitions havebeen added to the network database, users can mount a remote disk with theCommUnity desk accessory.andP;  This presents a list of available servers, fromwhich users choose one to be mounted by clicking on its name.andM;Other operations provided by the CommUnity desk accessory are Show NetworkStatus, which shows all adjacent and non-adjacent nodes that are active; ShowNetwork Counters, which shows the number of packets sent and received sinceCommUnity was last initialized; and Set CommUnity State On/Off, which turnsCommUnity on or off.andM;REMOTE CONTROLandM;CommUnity-Mac's Remote File Access utility will work with any operatingsystem that supports DECnet.andP;  But it will not work with nodes running the RSXoperating system, nor can it transfer files with records larger than 512bytes.andM;The user interface in version 1.3's Remote File Access application hasimproved significantly.andP;  Where before users had to hunt through its menus todo just about anything, now all settings are made by clicking on &quot;buttons&quot; inthe application's main screen, very similar to TSSnet's user interface.andM;Three new features have been added to Remote File Access: Remote Execute,Remote Print and Remote Submit.andP;  The Remote Execute feature executes a remotecommand file, Remote Submit submits a command file containing standard DCLcommands to the VAX's system batch queue, and Remote Print prints a localtext file on a remote printer.andP;  Both Remote Execute and Remote Submit bydefault send output to a log file in the command file's parent directory.andM;CommUnity-Mac also has a Mail utility that offers most of the familiar VMSMail functions: send, reply, forward, read and delete.andP;  These are accessedfrom the utility's Mail menu.andP;  Under its Network menu, Mail has an addressbook for storing frequently used E-mail addresses.andM;We ran a simple test to compare CommUnity-Mac's Mail with TSSnet's NetMail,mailing a 46-block text document from the VAX to the Mac.andP;  CommUnity-Mac wasmuch faster, taking 11 seconds to receive the file; TSSnet took four to eightminutes.andM;Although CommUnity-Mac's Mail utility worked well, its user interface couldstand to be simplified.andP;  Many of its functions could be moved from theutility's menus into one screen of radio buttons, as was done with the RemoteFile Access utility.andM;To test CommUnity-Mac's FAL, we created six benchmark tests: four copyingtests and two deletion tests.andP;  These join DR Labs' suite of Mac-to-VAXbenchmark tests.andM;Copy11 consists of copying the 357,283-byte binary executable image ofMicrosoft Word version 3.01, a word processing application, from the Mac tothe VAX using the FAL.andP;  Copy12 copies the same image in the oppositedirection.andP;  Copy13 copies a 100,886-byte Microsoft Word text file from theMac to the VAX using the FAL, and Copy14 reverses this operation.andM;Delete1 consists of deleting the Microsoft Word executable image from the Macusing a DCL command on the VAX.andP;  Delete2 consists of deleting the Word textfile from the Mac using the VAX.andM;We ran all six tests on CommUnity-Mac version 1.3 and TSSnet version 1.3.2,and compared the times for each test with how long the same operation tookwhen done locally on the Mac's hard drive (Fig.andP;  1).andP;  The largest differencebetween the two products was on Copy13, where CommUnity-Mac was 3.8 timesfaster than TSSnet.andP;  On Copy14 and Delete2, CommUnity-Mac was 3.63 and 2.03times faster, respectively, than TSSnet.andP;  The smallest difference was on theCopy12 benchmark, where CommUnity-Mac was only 1.55 times faster than TSSnet.andM;As we ran our tests, we discovered one significant problem withCommUnity-Mac's FAL when copying binary files from within deeply nestedfolders on the Mac.andM;When we copied the Microsoft Word application from a folder within a folderwithin a folder on the Mac to the VAX, then copied it back to its originaldirectory, the application's file attributes became garbled.andP;  It now appearedon the Mac as a generic document rather than with its own application icon.andM;TCI was advised of this problem and promised to address it in future releasesof the product.andM;DECNET PERFORMANCEandM;Because TCI and Thursby Software Systems have released new versions of theirDECnet utilities since we last tested them, we repeated our DECnet benchmarkson both.andP;  We found that, though CommUnity-Mac's DECnet copying speeds haveimproved somewhat, TSSnet's has not changed significantly (Fig.andP;  2).andM;Previously, TSSnet was much faster at copying over DECnet than CommUnity-Mac.andO;Now we found no decisive performance difference between them: TSSnet wasfaster on three of the six tests, and CommUnity-Mac was faster on the otherthree.andM;Our six DECnet file-copying benchmarks--Copy5, Copy6, Copy7, Copy8, Copy9 andCopy10--perform simple file transfers of binary and text files.andM;The Copy5 benchmark uses DECnet to transfer the executable image of MicrosoftWord version 3.01 from the Mac to the VAX, and the Copy6 benchmark moves itback to the Mac.andM;Copy7 and Copy8 use the text and binary file transfer protocols,respectively, to transfer a 100,886-byte Microsoft Word file from the Mac tothe VAX.andP;  Copy9 and Copy10 perform the same operations in reverse, copyingthe files from the VAX to the Mac.andM;All of our benchmark results were normalized to the time required to performthe same DECnet transfers between two MicroVAX IIs.andM;The most extreme differences were found on Copy9 and Copy10.andP;  TSSnet was 1.57times faster than CommUnity-Mac on Copy9, and CommUnity-Mac was 1.19 timesfaster than TSSnet on Copy10.andM;To see how much version 1.3's support for faster Ethernet cards like theEtherPort II card would speed CommUnity-Mac's performance as a file server,we tested it against Alisa Systems' AlisaShare and the PacerShare server fromPacer Software (Fig.andP;  3).andM;In general, we found, the CommUnity-Mac file server was slower at running ourMac-to-VAX benchmarks than its two rivals.andP;  It was slower than the Pacerserver for all seven tests and slower than the Alisa server for four of thetests.andM;DR Labs' Start benchmark, which tests the feasibility of keeping executableimages on the VAX, consists of starting Microsoft Word version 3.01 from aVAX file server.andP;  The Read benchmark measures how long it takes to read in a25,217-byte Microsoft Word document from the VAX when Word is running fromthe Mac's hard disk drive.andP;  The Load benchmark measures how long it takes toload a 27,136-byte file from the VAX into the Mac desktop publishingapplication Quark XPress, with XPress running on the Mac's disk.andM;The Copy1 benchmark copies the binary executable image of Microsoft Word fromthe Mac to the VAX, and Copy2 copies the same image in the oppositedirection.andP;  The Copy3 benchmark copies 21 HyperCard stacks in four folders (atotal of 1,848,320 bytes) from the Mac to the VAX.andP;  Copy4 copies the samelarge hierarchy of files and folders from the VAX to the Mac.andM;All benchmark times were normalized to how long it took to perform the sameoperations locally on the Mac.andM;In comparing these results, it should be remembered that the TCI server andPacerShare operate over DECnet, whereas AlisaShare operates over AppleTalk.andM;We found the greatest difference between the servers on the Copy3 benchmark,where the TCI server was 1.4 times slower than AlisaShare and 1.43 timesslower than PacerShare.andM;Finally, we used the same file server benchmarks to compare CommUnity-Mac'sperformance using its own VAX-based file server software with its performanceusing DEC's PCFS software (Fig.andP;  4).andM;Aside from performance, the main difference between the TCI and PCFS serversis that the PCFS server will not function properly when file names are longerthan eight characters, while the TCI server can handle file names with asmany as 32 characters.andM;We found, not surprisingly, that TCI's server was faster than DEC's PCFSserver for every operation.andP;  Although it's an advantage that users have theoption of using the PCFS server software--which comes bundled with VMS and isused by many PC sites--the TCI server software was sufficiently faster towarrant its use over PCFS.andM;TCI markets CommUnity-Mac in what it calls Total Solution packages.andP;  Eachpackage contains a CommUnity-Mac license and documentation, which togethersell for $495.andP;  The license alone is $350.andM;Total Solution packages add Ethernet cards to the basic package of licenseand documentation.andP;  The package with Dove's FastNet Ethernet card is $1,295;the one with Kinetics' EtherSC Ethernet controller is $1,445 for thin-wireEthernet and $1,495 for thick-wire Ethernet; the one with Kinetics' EtherPortSE card is $1,190; and the one with Kinetics' EtherPort II card is $1,190.andM;Overall, we were impressed with the changes made in version 1.3 ofCommUnity-Mac.andP;  With these improvements, CommUnity-Mac should be able to giveTSSnet stiff competition.andM;CommUnity-Mac is a strong product, offering the ability to communicatebetween a Mac and any other machine running CommUnity, such as a Sunworkstation or an IBM PC.andP;  For sites with many different platforms, CommUnityis a sure solution to networking problems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
