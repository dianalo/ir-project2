Jack Nicholson bought a Matisse for $430,000, but he was a bit player in a sale where 10 other bidders for impressionist paintings each spent more than $1 million.    Pounding his gavel at the gleaming mahogany rostrum was auctioneer John L. Marion, and he had his hands full. For this high-stakes auction, more patrons than usual were hiding behind secret bidding codes. Mr. Marion had to keep straight the man who was bidding whenever he took his glasses off and another who bid by holding his pen to his chin. Industrialist Norton Simon had his wife, actress Jennifer Jones, bid vivaciously on a Degas pastel but dropped out at $1.8 million. From there on, Mr. Simon bid secretly with his hand on his chin, and at the gavel's last smack, $3.7 million, the Degas was his.    Two hours and 95 artworks later, Mr. Marion had broken the world's record for an art auction. The $37 million sale staggered the art world and was a bonanza for Sotheby's, which extracts a 10% commission from buyers and a negotiated fee (up to 10%) from sellers.    Four years later, the art market is hotter than ever. Mr. Marion is hardly the cause, but he is a major character in the drama, regarded by many as the best art auctioneer in the U.S. As the art market expands, his reputation is growing; he even had a role last season on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; -- playing himself.    During the hectic spring and fall seasons, the New York office of London-based Sotheby's Holdings Inc. schedules one or two auctions a day. As head auctioneer and chairman of Sotheby's North America, Mr. Marion handles only the most important sales, leaving the minor daytime auctions of such items as books and teapots to Sotheby's 15 junior auctioneers.    A Tuesday evening in May shows a typical Marion performance. It is a sale of Latin American art, and the crowd is exuberant -- to Mr. Marion's delight. &quot;See that couple in the third row?&quot; he says as he strides toward the podium. &quot;They fight and elbow each other all through the sale, but I never start till they get here. They buy a lot.&quot;    From the front of the big room, Mr. Marion's mellow voice tempts and cajoles: &quot;Say $40,000? Why not? At 42,000, in the front, now 43,000, now four. I have 45, the lady's bid. Now 47,000, at the rear. See how easy it is? All done then?&quot; The bids pick up. &quot;Fifty-four, 55, 56,000. At 57,000, now 60,000. Sold. It's yours then, sir, at $60,000. Well done.&quot;    Auctioneers must spout numbers fast, remember secret bids and a lot more. Bids usually go up in increments of about 10%, and that pattern is etched into an auctioneer's brain. But he must know when and how to break the pattern and whether to end on an odd or even number to cover the exact amount of a so-called order bid, made on behalf of an absent bidder.    A high-level art auctioneer is, finally, a cheerleader and umpire. He (or she; a handful of art auctioneers are women) must be in total control of a crowd of rich, powerful people competing intensely for a rare object. His delivery must be convincing, even hypnotic, but not coercive. Those trying to buy low must trust his fairness as much as sellers hoping to sell high.    &quot;John Marion is the greatest auctioneer I've ever seen,&quot; says Ronald Bourgeault, a New Hampshire antiques dealer and auctioneer with fans of his own. &quot;Everything I know about auctioneering I learned watching him. How to inject the right amount of humor without getting slapsticky. How long to wait before you knock something down. I've had big bidders walk out because I went too long: They thought I was milking bids.&quot;    Harold Sack, a near-legendary New York furniture dealer says, &quot;John has a way of smelling out a bidder. I go in there sometimes with a limit, and, by golly, when John gets ahold of me, I go beyond it.&quot; When U.S. Trust decides to sell a big estate at Sotheby's, Chairman Daniel Davison demands that Mr. Marion preside. &quot;It's a bottom-line thing,&quot; says Mr. Davison. &quot;He gets the best prices.&quot;    The Marion style is distinctive. A broad-shouldered man over 6 feet tall with a weathered face, the 53-year-old Mr. Marion looks like a Marlboro man in a good suit. He exudes authority and ease and is famous for sportsmanlike quips that tease out rather than demand a higher bid.    &quot;Come on, make it a hundred thousand: It'll sound better when you tell your friends&quot; is vintage Marion. At a major evening sale last fall, Mr. Marion said to one bidder: &quot;Sir, can't you say $780,000?&quot; When the reply was &quot;No,&quot; Mr. Marion told the crowd, &quot;I think he means it.&quot;    Mr. Marion's rapport with bidders borders on the telepathic. &quot;It sounds weird, but I can feel where the next bid is coming from,&quot; he says. &quot;If I feel there's a bid on my left side and I turn, nine times out of 10, there is one. Maybe it's body language, people shifting their weight before bidding, but I sense it.&quot; He says he also knows, from 50 feet away, when someone just can't be coaxed higher: &quot;They get these X's in their eyes,&quot; he says.    Mr. Marion's role on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; came about because Bill Cosby, a big collector of American furniture and a frequent Sotheby's bidder (mostly by phone), was impressed by Mr. Marion's podium performances. Also captivated was television producer and art collector Douglas Cramer, who insisted Mr. Marion be hired for an auction scene last winter on &quot;The Colbys.&quot; &quot;I've watched auctioneers around the world, and none has John's showmanship,&quot; says Mr. Cramer.    The athletic, sociable son of an Italian mother and Irish father, Mr. Marion grew up in the auction business. His father, Louis Marion, started at age 16 in the mailroom of a predecessor firm of Parke-Bernet Galleries (which later merged with Sotheby's) and worked his way up to head auctioneer. John Marion, although interested in sales, wanted to make a name for himself outside his father's sphere. However, in 1960, when he was in his mid-20s, he gave in to family pressure to start at Parke-Bernet and was put to work on an inventory of the basement.    Before long, Mr. Marion was training all Sotheby's auctioneers and pepping up the firm's auctioneering style. Auctioneers had traditionally read aloud from the catalog description and if an item wasn't selling, tried to keep bidding alive by a stream of praise. Now, auctioneers move briskly through a sale, referring to each item by lot number and artist as it snaps into view on a small circular stage. The auctioneer shouts a few bids to launch the item and if bidding dries up, it's on to the next. Mr. Marion says his top speed is 120 items an hour; but at big impressionist sales, he slows to 45 because &quot;you have to think longer before spending millions.&quot;    Though Mr. Marion promoted a crisper auctioneering style, it is still far more embellished than the traditional English style, which made for a culture clash when Sotheby's bought Parke-Bernet in 1964. British auctioneers speak softly, rarely repeat a price and never crack jokes. Mr. Marion demonstrates, in a pinched English accent: &quot;Nine pounds. Ten. Eleven pounds. All done now? Sold.&quot;    &quot;The English enjoyed saying that John Marion's cowboy style was typical American snake-oil selling,&quot; says a former colleague. But as auction audiences expand beyond experienced collectors, even the British are adding explanatory patter. Christopher Burge, the highly regarded British head auctioneer in New York for Christie's International PLC, says he sees bidders in the crowd &quot;with an absolutely terrified look&quot; who clearly don't know whose bid he is calling. He says: &quot;I spend more time now saying things like, 'Not yours, madam. It's {the bid} against you, at the back of the room.'&quot;    While Mr. Marion has legions of fans, there are art experts critical of what they call his grandstanding. Other detractors, including some former Sotheby's employees, describe Mr. Marion as limited in his knowledge of art. &quot;He would rather lunch with moguls and politicians than intellectual types,&quot; says one former executive. Mr. Marion replies that &quot;I don't have a cataloger's knowledge, but I've always considered myself a part of a team.&quot;    But the deepest criticism of Mr. Marion is reserved for his management skills. As president, he led a major expansion in New York in the early '80s just before the art market slumped. Former staff members say his subsequent huge layoffs were panic-driven and insensitively handled. Mr. Marion says, &quot;There is no way to handle cutbacks that will be a popular move&quot; and admits that his skills and interests lie more in sales than management. In any case, since Sotheby's was bought in 1983 by a group led by developer A. Alfred Taubman, most of the New York operation's administrative duties have been shifted to Diana Brooks, a former banker and now president of Sotheby's North America. Mr. Marion has become more active than ever as a figurehead and client-finder.    Indeed, his job starts long before a sale. Although traditionally auction-house experts in different fields are the chief scouts of good material to sell, top auctioneers help, too. Mr. Marion especially is adept at mingling in high society and cultivating owners of fabulous collections. Barbara Johnson, a Princeton, N.J., lawyer, sold a large scrimshaw collection at Sotheby's after Mr. Marion paid her a visit. &quot;He knew my astrological sign, and he said he was going to cover the auction house in geraniums, my favorite flower,&quot; says Ms. Johnson, who got more than $4 million for her scrimshaws.    Before a major auction, all the items are exhibited at Sotheby's and Mr. Marion spends the week talking to collectors and dealers to gauge interest. In his copy of the sale catalog, he marks beside each lot the minimum price acceptable to the seller (the reserve, a secret); order bids; the initials of likely bidders; and any secret signals.    By the time he climbs into the former church pulpit that serves as his lectern, he has a firm knowledge of what is for sale and who probably wants it. This knowledge is well rewarded with a salary &quot;comfortably into six figures,&quot; and truly inspired auctioneering will be reflected in his annual performance bonus.    Still, no amount of expertise can safeguard any auctioneer from occasional flops. There are auctions in which bidders dispute results, forcing bidding on some items to be reopened. And nothing much helps recession-era sales, when as much as one item in four doesn't sell.    Sometimes secret signals can be a nightmare, too. Consider these written instructions once given by Norton Simon to Christie's for a London sale: &quot;When Mr. Simon is sitting down, he is bidding. If he bids openly, he is also bidding. If he sits down again, he is not bidding unless he raises his finger. Having raised his finger, he is bidding until he stands up again.&quot; The auctioneer got confused and had to start the item over, with an irate Mr. Simon bidding openly.    But regardless of what happens, the auction must go on. That was proved by Mr. Marion at a Sotheby's auction in the '70s when a front-row bidder keeled over from a heart attack. Mr. Marion jumped off the rostrum, summoned help and then, when the victim had been removed from the premises, went on with the auction. &quot;I had to finish,&quot; he says. &quot;People come from all over the country or the world. You can't just say, 'Come back in a month.'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
