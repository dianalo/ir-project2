Thousands of students hurled rocks and firebombs at police onthe anniversary of a student uprising April 19, 1960, that broughtdown the authoritarian government of President Syngman Rhee.   Police responded by firing tear gas at waves of student shoutingfor the overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo and ``Yankee go home!''   News reports from Changwon, a southern industrial city, saidabout 10,000 workers rallied at three factories and many respondedwith firebombs and bricks when police stopped a march by 5,000strikers.   Confrontations between riot police and students opposed to Roh'sgovernment were reported at 13 schools in Seoul. Police chargedinto attacking crowds and made arrests during hit-ant-run battlesafter nightfall.   Authorities said more than 40,000 students demonstrated on theanniversary at colleges and universities around the country, butdid not say how many observances became violent.   Several injuries of protesters and police were seen in Seoul.Police said they had no figures on injuries and arrests.   Before dawn Wednesday, protesters hurled about 20 firebombs intoCamp Isabell, a U.S. Army storage facility in eastern Seoul.American military officials reported minor damage.   Students attack U.S. facilities to dramatize demands for thewithdrawal of the 43,000 American troops based in South Korea undera mutual defense pact.   The government had put police on top alert to block anniversaryprotests. At least 20,000 riot officers were deployed in Seoul.   Radical students, a small but vocal minority, are trying to makean alliance with militant workers to oust the Roh government, butlack broad public support because of their extreme views.   Government officials have said strikes threaten to disrupteconomic and political stability. Labor unrest has spread to nearlyall industries in recent weeks and the government says it will usemilitary personnel to keep vital industries running if necessary.   Dozens of labor activists have been arrested since a crackdownon violent labor actions began last week. Officials accusedmilitant unions of trying to create a general strike for higher pay.   At least 59 militant unions in Seoul decided on Wednesday tocall a joint strike Friday in protest of the crackdown on labor.Union leaders said they would seek an alliance with students.   Roh, a former general inaugurated in February 1988, hasintroduced broad democratic reforms but dissidents associated hisgovernment with the authoritarian regime of Chun Doo-hwan, anothergeneral who preceded him.</TEXT></DOC>
