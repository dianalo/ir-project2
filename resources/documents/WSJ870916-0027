Shares also fell in light trading in Frankfurt and slumped in Milan in response to the Italian government's new foreign-exchange restrictions. Stocks closed higher in Sydney, mixed in Hong Kong and lower in Singapore. The Tokyo market was closed for a holiday.    London's 100-share index fell 7.3 points to 2264.5. The Financial Times 30-share index was unchanged at 1775.4. The gold mines index fell 3.7 to 445.8. Volume rose to 696 million shares from 454.6 million Monday.    Uncertainty ahead of tomorrow's scheduled release of unemployment and average earnings figures and Friday's money supply data as well as October's planned share offering in British Petroleum continued to keep many investors out of the market, dealers said.    Activity focused on individual corporate statements and transactions rather than on any broader trends, they said.    Most sectors finished with modest losses, although some insurance and brewing issues advanced. Consolidated Gold Fields was unchanged at 1,510 pence ($24.71) a share. It said pretax profit more than doubled to #244.4 million in the year ended June 30. The figure was only slightly above market expectations.    Fisons fell 20 to 334. It said first-half pretax profit rose 20% to #44.6 million, which was less than analysts had expected. Other drug stocks were narrowly mixed, with Glaxo Holdings up 2 at 1,719 and Wellcome down 2 at 489.    Bass rose 13 to 982. It agreed to buy the international assets and 13 U.S. hotels of Memphis, Tenn.-based Holiday Corp. Among other brewers, Grand Metropolitan rose 3 to 544.    British Telecommunications fell 8 to 255. Britain's chief telephone regulator said the government is likely to order an investigation of the company's pricing policy. Such a step could block or delay the sale of the government's remaining 49% stake in the company, which had been expected next year.    Frankfurt shares were mostly lower after an early rally fizzled on profit-taking and a lack of buy orders. A slumping bond market and a feeling that the dollar isn't likely to move up much further against the West German mark contributed to the uncertain mood, dealers said.    Activity focused on the automotive sector, where Daimler-Benz dropped 16.50 to 1,097.50 marks ($604.18) a share and Volkswagen fell 3.80 to 400. Porsche climbed 10 to 995.    AEG-Telefunken, which is 56%-owned by Daimler, slid 4 to 337. Siemens was down 1 at 665.    Most banking shares bucked the market trend, as Dresdner Bank rose 3 to 365.50 and Commerzbank advanced 2 to 305.50. But Deutsche Bank, the nation's largest commercial bank, eased 0.70 to 697.80.    Milan stocks fell in active trading in continued reaction to the foreign-exchange restrictions Italy announced Sunday. Major investors and mutual funds sparked a late rally that cut some losses.    The restrictions include a ceiling on bank credit that dealers said will cut production and hurt performance, especially of industrial stocks.    Among industrial issues, Fiat fell 150 to 10,120 lire ($7.69) a share, then recovered in post-settlement trading to 10,220. Montedison dropped 36 to 2,180 but also regained ground in after-hours trading to 2,200.    Australian shares rose amid confidence that the government's budget report would pave the way for further declines in interest rates.    National Australia Bank rose 0.18 to 5.96 Australian dollars ($4.34) a share, Australia andamp; New Zealand Banking Group rose 0.8 to 5.66, and Westpac Banking was up 0.14 to 7.    After the market closed, the government said its budget deficit will shrink to 27 million Australian dollars in the year ending next June 30 from 2.72 billion dollars in fiscal 1987. The projected figure includes about one billion dollars in proceeds from selling government assets. It would be Australia's narrowest deficit in 17 years and the smallest as a percentage of gross domestic product in 35 years.    The news prompted Australia andamp; New Zealand Banking Group to cut its Australian prime lending rate a full point to 14 1/4% effective next Monday. Market interest rates also fell late yesterday.    Hong Kong stocks were mixed as trading slowed from Monday's level. Analysts and bankers said the 10.31 billion Hong Kong dollar ($1.32 billion) stock offering announced Monday by Cheung Kong (Holdings) and related companies isn't expected to interfere with plans by other companies to issue shares in Hong Kong.    The offering by four companies controlled by Li Ka-shing, Cheung Kong's chairman, could depress the market briefly, they said, but there is believed to be enough liquidity in Hong Kong to absorb still more shares. One analyst said about seven billion dollars of new shares is due to be offered by year end.    Trading in the four Li companies -- Cheung Kong, Hutchison Whampoa, Cavendish International Holdings and Hongkong Electric Holdings -- was suspended Monday and yesterday.    Singapore trading remained thin, with the market declining on scattered profit-taking. Institutions stayed on the sidelines in the absence of any incentives to sell or buy.    Elsewhere, shares rose in Brussels and Zurich, were mixed in Amsterdam and fell in Paris and Stockholm.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                   % This                           Sep 14     Sep 11       Year U.S ...................... 300.8      299.9      + 31.9 Britain .................. 680.7      677.4      + 36.8 Canada ................... 437.3      436.3      + 31.3 Japan ................... 1215.2     1207.6      + 28.6 France ................... 438.7      437.9      +  7.5 Germany .................. 247.1      242.9      -  4.9 Hong Kong ............... 2587.7     2608.5      + 45.5 Switzerland .............. 209.3      209.2      +  4.2 Australia ................ 413.1      413.4      + 56.5 World index .............. 480.1      482.2      + 34.5</TEXT></DOC>
