It consists of two images, A and B, separatedby 2.2 arc s at a redshift zsub(q) = 2.719. The lensing galaxy has alsobeen found. It lies very near the line connecting the two QSO (quasi-stellarobjects) images, approx. 0.8 arc s from the fainter one. Applicationof gravitational optometry to this system leads to a value Msub(o) orapprox. = 2.4 x 10/sup 11/ M solar masses for the mass of the lensinggalaxy and to {Delta}t approx. 7 weeks for the most likely travel-timedifference between the two light paths to the QSO.</TEXT></DOC>
