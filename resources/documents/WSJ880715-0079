Union Texas, the nation's largest independent oil company, owns 20% of the Piper oil field as well as a similar interest in the adjacent Claymore and Scapa fields. But its insurance coverage, procured from a syndicate through the Lloyds of London exchange, would cover three years of losses from those fields so long as the average price of oil doesn't exceed $20 a barrel, the company said.    And oil prices aren't likely to climb beyond that level, said A. Clark Johnson, chairman of the Houston-based company. In an interview, he projected that the price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, will average $16.50 a barrel this year. Without insurance coverage, the company would lose $18 million to $20 million in profit in the second half, Mr. Johnson said.    Union Texas is also a major natural gas producer. Texaco Inc., which holds interests in the Piper, Claymore and Scapa oil fields and wholly owns three adjacent fields shuttered as a result of the explosion, said yesterday that it would lose revenue of $1.8 million each day the production is shut in. Because Texaco doesn't carry business-interruption insurance, &quot;the loss of production will result in a reduction of earnings,&quot; a Texaco spokeswoman confirmed. A Texaco source previously had said the disaster would hurt earnings.    Occidental Petroleum Corp., the operator of the Piper Alpha platform, has already said the tragedy will depress Occidental's annual earnings by five cents to 10 cents a share.    Texaco has estimated that it may be able to get production back on line at its Tartan-Highlander-Petronella oil fields in the North Sea within four to six weeks. However, an Occidental spokesman in Aberdeen, Scotland, said yesterday that Texaco's figures &quot;are just a guess at best.&quot;    The Occidental spokesman said that before production can resume, five gas wells at the Piper rig must be capped. The Kingsnorth U.K., a semi-submersible drilling rig, began to drill a so-called relief well that might be necessary to plug the wells. A second rig is moving into place to start drilling a second relief well, he said.    A source close to Texaco said that it could be more than four months before full production from the Tartan complex would be realized. He said Texaco will be required to seek an exemption from the energy regulators in the U.K. to &quot;flare&quot; more natural gas than is typically allowed. Texaco officials estimate that most any exemption would still limit the company to restoring only 50% to 75% of former production levels.    Union Texas, meanwhile, estimated that second-quarter net income nearly tripled to about $29 million, or 20 cents a share, from $10.2 million a year earlier. However, most of the net gains involve two nonrecurring items that include a take-or-pay settlement on a natural gas contract and the resolution of several international tax issues. Operating earnings are expected to be flat. Revenue was an estimated $302.1 million, compared with $304.9 million last year. </TEXT></DOC>
