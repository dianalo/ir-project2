(AMD), a maker of high-speed 80286chips.andP;  Doug Gephardt, a member of the technical staff at the Sunnyvale,Calif., company, said it cost AMD $2 million to build a system that verifieschip performance at rated speeds across the full rated temperature range.andM;Everex Systems Inc. does not even rely on the ratings assigned by chipmanufacturers, according to Bruce Dunleavy, vice president of computersystems at the Fremont, Calif., firm.andM;''We test every chip that goes into machines at clock rates of 12MHz andhigher,'' he said.andP;  ''We may need 80-nanosecond RAM from one vendor toprovide the same performance as 100-nanosecond RAM from another.''andM;For their part, users can take steps to identify these problems before theycause serious harm.andP;  A user can create a diagnostic spreadsheet, for example,with a startup macro that recalculates the values and then prints the resultsto a file.andP;  The DOS COMP command (FC in some DOS versions) then can comparethat file to a reference version.andM;When system vendors choose to exceed their suppliers' specifications, theymay create their own implied warranty of fitness for the system's advertised(high-speed) use.andP;  Depending on state law, victims of bleeding-edge burnoutmay have grounds for recovery of damages.andM;Prevention, though, is preferable to diagnosis or cure.andP;  Users should seekfrom suppliers statements that the purchased components are running withintheir rated limits.andP;  The alternative is to risk driving at Grand Prix speedson go-cart tires.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
