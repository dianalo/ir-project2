It says she was &quot;caught by the Internal Revenue Service.&quot;    As a supervisor of a team of postal inspectors devoted to enforcement of the mail-fraud statute and responsible for the Giglio investigation, I thought you might be interested in this information. Ms. Giglio was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Evan Spangler, formerly of the Northern District of Indiana, currently of the Southern District of Texas, and investigated by Postal Inspector Thomas A. Lemke of the Inspection Service's Chicago division. She pleaded guilty to a two-count information charging violations of 18 USC 1341, &quot;mail fraud,&quot; and not to income-tax evasion.    J.C.
