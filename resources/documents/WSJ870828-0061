In turn, the sliding dollar and lower bond futures prices sent stock-index futures prices lower.    Amid concern about the dollar's slide and the inability of central bank intervention so far to halt the tumble, Treasury bond futures for September settlement at the Chicago Board of Trade skidded 1 5/32 to 88. They traded as high as 89 8/32 and as low as 87 28/32 during the session.    Selling in the interest rate futures accelerated when the yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rose above the key 9% level, said Frederic Leiner, financial futures analyst in Chicago for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.    On the shorter end of the spectrum, Mr. Leiner said, futures on Eurodollars and U.S. Treasury bills were pressured by concern that the weak dollar would cause the Fed to tighten credit to help stem the currency's slide.    There was speculation that the Federal Reserve would raise the discount rate, or the interest rate it charges on loans to member banks, said Jeffrey Priest, head of fixed income trading at Miller Tabak Hirsch andamp; Co. in New York.    Chart-guided, or technical, selling also put pressure on interest rate futures prices, analysts and traders said. The selling occured as Treasury bond futures fell below 88 22/32 then 88 9/32, Mr. Priest said.    And while others disagreed about the levels that triggered further selling pressure, most agreed about the trend.    &quot;Today was one of those days when you feel very comfortable shorting the market,&quot; Mr. Priest said, referring to the practice of selling a futures contract with hopes of buying it back at a lower price.    Treasury bond futures prices continued their slide in the evening session at the CBOT. At one point the September contract was down 8/32 at 87 24/32.    In other futures markets yesterday:    ENERGY: Oil futures prices rose amid reports that Kuwait indefinitely halted spot, or noncontract, crude oil sales. Some analysts said the move was an attempt to bring Kuwait's output within the quota agreed on by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Kuwait, whose OPEC-imposed quota is a little less than one million barrels a day, is believed to be producing between 1.5 million and two million barrels a day, analysts said. &quot;This could be the first step toward reining in OPEC production,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, energy futures analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York. However, the reported move by Kuwait was offset by other factors, market specialists said. One analyst cited above-quota output by other OPEC members. And Iraq's decision earlier this week to discount prices -- apparently in an attempt to grab market share from Iran and other producers -- helped negate any upward pressure on prices, analysts said. For the moment, at least, some traders have stepped out of the market, trying to ascertain the cartel's next move, brokers and analysts said. Starting Sept. 7, OPEC ministerial committees charged with monitoring quotas will meet in an attempt to curb the cartel's above-quota output. Until then, many traders with big profits on the books are going to take them, an analyst said.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Hog futures prices fell after news of a larger-than-expected slaughter yesterday. About 295,000 hogs were butchered, about 12,000 more than most traders predicted and the highest number since early summer. A respite yesterday from heavy rain in much of the Midwest allowed producers to move their hogs to meatpackers, said Jerry Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. Despite falling, October cattle prices at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ended higher than cash prices. Analysts attributed the premium to speculation that Japan and Canada will follow the U.S. move to limit imports of pesticide-contaminated Australian beef. However, cattle futures prices are expected to drop moderately at the start of trading today on the news late yesterday that the Agriculture Department apparently is easing its restrictions on the Australian beef. The department said it has agreed to reinspect the Australian beef that it banned. Prices &quot;were rallying on the idea that the USDA might ban more meat and destroy what it was holding,&quot; said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington Heights, Ill. &quot;Now that that is no longer the case the futures will decline.&quot;    COCOA: Futures prices ended with modest losses as late selling erased initial advances. September cocoa on the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange in New York fell $5 a metric ton to $2,000, after being as high as $2,020. The day's high represented an advance of $140 since Aug. 18. A metric ton is equal to 1.1 U.S. short tons, or 2,204.6 pounds. Concern about dry weather in Ivory Coast and Brazil has hovered over the market all season, helping to prop prices. And while news service reports yesterday indicated that rain fell in both countries, analysts said, prices continued to receive support from the possibility that the moisture may be too little, too late and that crops may have suffered damage from the dry weather. Also propping prices, analysts said, is the increasing return to the market by chocolate makers, emerging from their normal world-wide summer slowdown. Contributing to the downturn at the end of the day, another analyst said, were reports that both Brazil and the Ivory Coast were selling somewhat more aggresively. For the past two weeks, he said, producers were content to let buyers seek them out.    PRECIOUS METALS: Gold and silver futures prices fell on technical factors, traders said. Silver prices had the steepest fall, triggered by chart-guided technical selling, brokers said. Meanwhile, bullion demand, which typically starts picking up this time of year, remains disappointingly weak, analysts and traders said. </TEXT></DOC>
