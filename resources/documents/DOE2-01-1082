<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-01-1082 </DOCNO><TEXT>The portable K-edge densitometer developed by the Los Alamos NationalLaboratory was used by Euratom in a number of in-field applications.The objective of these field trials was to check the instrument's performance,its ease of use and its compatibility with plant operational procedures.The instrument was used by inspectors to measure Pu product solutionsof reprocessing plants with Pu concentrations ranging from about 10 toabout 370 g/L. In total about 100 samples were measured. On average thedifferences between measured and declared values were of the order of1-2% for concentrations larger than 100 g/L. In separate experimentsthe stability and reproducibility of the instrument were checked. Anotheraspect looked at was the effect of changing hardware components and sources(different portable multichannel analyser, different Ge detector, useof new as opposed to old sources) on the value of the calibration constantand on the performance of the instrument. An overall evaluation of themeasurement campaigns indicates that the calibration constant is increasingwith time. This effect should be further examined. Some other practicalrecommendations and feedback obtained from operators are given. 3 refs,2 figs, 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
