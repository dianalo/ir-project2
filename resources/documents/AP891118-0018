The satellite, which has been sending back information about thesun for nearly 10 years, was repaired by a visiting space shuttlecrew in 1984. But now it has run out of fuel to power the rocketsthat have kept it out of the grip of Earth's atmosphere.   ``They are projecting Nov. 29, give or take a few days,'' saidRandee Exler, spokeswoman for NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.   A few weeks ago, NASA said three big chunks of the satellitemight survive the fiery trip through the atmosphere and crash toEarth. But Ms. Exler said there are estimates that as many as 11pieces might survive.   ``There will be debris, but we feel confident that most will besmall pieces,'' she said. The satellite's path is 70 percent overwater.   Solar Max flies over much of South America, Africa, India,Australia and the southernmost tip of China. The only portions ofthe United States under its track are South Florida, the extremesouthern part of Texas and Hawaii.   For weeks, the satellite's altitude has been dropping steadily.On Friday, Solar Max's orbit was 177 miles high, a 25.7 mile dropsince Oct. 31. It fell 2.6 miles since Thursday.   Engineers turned off fine-pointing instruments and thespacecraft went into a ``safe hold.'' Scientific operations didn'tcease completely; three instruments still were taking and sendingdata.   Even at the end, the satellite will perform useful service.Engineers will try to blow off its solar panels, an exercise thatwould be required if such a satellite were to be put into a spaceshuttle cargo bay for return to Earth.   Once the panels are gone, all work will cease.   Solar Max cost $77 million to build and launch in February 1980,at a time of maximum activity in the sun's 11-year sunspot cycle.Its mission was to study solar flares.   But after 10 months of service, three fuses blew in thesatellite's attitude control box and it was unable to point itselfaccurately. That, in turn, caused four onboard instruments to fail.   In 1984, the shuttle Challenger pulled alongside Solar Max andastronaut Terry Hart reached out and grabbed it with the ship'srobot arm. The next day, two astronauts working in the open cargobay replaced the control system module and an electronics box.   The satellite has been working well since then. For a time therewere plans to reboost it to a higher orbit but that would have setback other missions and the idea was abandoned.</TEXT></DOC>
