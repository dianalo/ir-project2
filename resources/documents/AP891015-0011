Seven otherpolitical prisoners also were freed.   Mandela, the most prominent jailed leader of the outlawedguerrilla movement, remains in prison, although his release withinthe next months is widely expected.   Sisulu, 77, arrived under police escort at his home in Sowetoand embraced his wife, Albertina, an activist who was under severepolice restrictions until Friday.   Youths who had been waiting for Sisulu lifted the white-haired,bespectacled black nationalist atop their shoulders before he wentinside.   ``I feel very well,'' Sisulu told reporters. ``I am inspired.''   Also freed early Sunday were the seven other prisoners whoseimpending unconditional release was announced Tuesday by PresidentF.W. de Klerk.   These include four other men arrested in 1963 and sentenced tolife prison terms in 1964 along with Sisulu and Mandela _ AndrewMlangeni, 63, Elias Mostsoaledi, 65, Ahmed Kathrada, 60, andRaymond Mhlaba, 68, as well as ANC leader, Wilton Mkwayi, 67, whowas sentenced to life in prison in a separate 1964 trial.   The group also includes 80-year-year ANC activist Oscar Mpetha,who had been hospitalized in Cape Town, and Jafta Masemola, 58, amember of the Pan Africanist Congress guerrilla movement who livesoutside Pretoria.   Mpetha was serving a five-year prison term for terrorism.Masemola was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1963.   Sisulu, who arrived home in a gray suit and blue tie, emergedafter about three hours to speak to reporters and give aclenched-fist salute to a crowd of 300 well-wishers outside hishome, some waving ANC flags.   Asked if he had feared he might die in prison, Sisulu said: ``Iwas quite prepared for death. But I knew the pressure was buildingfor our release, and I never despaired.''   Sisulu conferred at his home with several anti-apartheid leaders.   The freed ANC leaders are expected to apply for passports totravel to Lusaka, Zambia, for consultations with the guerrillamovement's exiled leadership.   Although the ANC remains outlawed, the release of Sisulu and hiscolleagues has been widely viewed as a tacit acknowledgement by thegovernment of the movement's influence and popularity among SouthAfrica's black majority.   Even relatively conservative black leaders have said they willreject any negotiations with the government unless the ANC islegalized and its jailed leaders freed.   In recent weeks, the government has permitted ANC flags andposters to be displayed openly at mass protests, something notallowed before de Klerk took power in mid-August.   Symbols of the guerrilla movement were in evidence Saturday,when more than 100,000 blacks joined in marches mationwideprotesting government policy and celebrating the imminent releaseof the eight prisoners.   Organizers said never before had so many large anti-governmentmarches been held in the country simultaneously.   Mandela, 71, conferred with Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee andother government officials before the announcement of the prisonerreleases. There has been increasing speculation that Mandela doesnot want to go free until the government takes further steps tolegalize ANC political activity.   ``The ANC leader clearly understands the power he wields,''wrote political analysist Gary Van Staden in The Star newspaper ofJohannesburg on Sunday. ``If, by remaining in jail, he can achievethe unbanning of his and other organizations and strengthen theANC's position in the negotiation process, then his own historysuggests he will opt for the tough choice.''   De Klerk has offered to negotiate a new constitution within fiveyears that would extend political rights to the disenfranchisedblack majority, but he envisions some arrangement in which whiteswould retain veto power over major decisions.   Black leaders say meaningful talks cannot begin until the stateof emergency is lifted, the ANC is legalized and all politicalprisoners are freed.</TEXT></DOC>
