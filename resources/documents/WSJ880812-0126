Stertz (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> AUT </IN><TEXT>   A circuit court judge in Chicago dismissed a proposed settlement of a class-action suit against Audi of America Inc. over the troubled Audi 5000 luxury sedan's loss of resale value.    Under the proposed settlement, Audi was supposed to give rebates as high as $2,000 to 391,000 Audi 5000 owners. But the rebates were only valid on the purchase of a new Audi and they weren't transferable. Cook County Circuit Court Judge Thomas R. Rakowski called the conditions on the settlement unacceptable.    &quot;It puts people in a position where they have to buy an Audi to reap any benefits,&quot; Judge Rakowski said during a hearing. &quot;Clearly it's a settlement that I couldn't live with.&quot;    The lawsuit originally sought damages from Audi because the 5000 model's resale value plunged following allegations that the car is susceptible to sudden, unintended acceleration. The suit purported to cover owners across the country of Audi 5000s from model years 1978 through 1986. Audi of America is a division of Volkswagen AG's Volkswagen of America Inc. U.S. sales and marketing subsidiary.    In June, attorneys for the plaintiffs conceded they would have trouble pinpointing the cause of sudden acceleration -- a phenomenon that causes a car to unexpectedly surge out of control. As a result, the attorneys said their case seemed too weak to do anything but settle. During the hearing, Audi attorneys said only 1,500 members of the class decided against being a part of the settlement.    Still, many Audi owners had expressed deep dissatisfaction with the proposed settlement, saying it did little to recover their losses. More than a dozen attorneys representing individuals or groups of the class attended yesterday's hearing to protest.    &quot;It was simply an outrage,&quot; said Steven M. Kramer, a New York attorney who has filed a similar suit covering Audi 5000 owners in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. &quot;It was grossly unfair to all of the people involved.&quot;    With the dismissal of the proposed settlement, the class-action suit will again proceed toward a trial unless the plaintiffs and Audi reach another settlement. Audi attorneys declined to say whether the company will seek another settlement or allow the case to go to trial. </TEXT></DOC>
