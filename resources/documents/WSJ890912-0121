The composite, which ended last week about flat, declined 0.89 to 470.42. The story was the same for the OTC's largest issues. The Nasdaq 100 Index of nonfinancial stocks rose 0.61 to 445.92. The Nasdaq Financial Index slipped 0.09 to 468.57.    Trading volume, which usually is meager on Mondays, totaled 113.5 million shares. That was well off the average daily turnover of 132.6 million for Nasdaq through August.    Despite the Nasdaq composite's lackluster performance of late, some traders aren't troubled. E.E. &quot;Buzzy&quot; Geduld, president of Herzog, Heine, Geduld, said, &quot;I think the market is doing better than the averages indicate. There really isn't much stock for sale, which leads me to believe that {the market is undergoing} an orderly consolidation.&quot;    Connaught BioSciences surged nearly 21% on news that Ciba-Geigy and Chiron said they intend to make an all-cash bid to acquire the common stock outstanding of Connaught BioSciences they don't already own, for $25.23 a share, or $642.5 million. The proposed bid amounts to about $764 million Canadian dollars.    Connaught jumped 4 3/8 to 25 5/8 on 620,200 shares. Chiron, a biotechnology issue, added 7/8 to 27 1/8 on 306,000 shares. The companies said the offer is conditioned on a minimum of 11 million shares being tendered and rejection by Connaught shareholders of a previously proposed merger with Institut Merieux, a French concern.    The companies said the 11 million shares, together with the two million shares, or 9.4% previously acquired by them, represent about 51% of the shares of Connaught BioSciences on a fully diluted basis.    Dunkin' Donuts rose about 10%, or 4 1/4, to 45 1/4 on 528,000 shares after the company's board rejected the $45-a-share buyout offer by a group including a unit of Unicorp Canada as inadequate. The Dunkin' Donuts directors instructed management, together with its financial adviser, Goldman Sachs, to explore whether shareholder values would be maximized by remaining independent or by any other alternatives that may come along, including acquisition of the company by a third party.    LIN Broadcasting rose 1 1/4 to 106 3/4 on 1.8 million shares. The New York broadcasting and cellular communications concern agreed to merge its domestic cellular telephone interests with BellSouth. The combined company will serve some 500,000 customers in more than 40 markets, the two concerns said.    In exchange for its domestic cellular interests, BellSouth will receive newly issued LIN common shares representing a 50% stake after the merger, the companies said. In addition, BellSouth might also receive some LIN preferred stock.    The companies said that before the merger, LIN will spin off its television broadcasting subsidiaries to stockholders and intends to pay its pre-merger stockholders a special cash dividend of $20 a share. BellSouth and LIN said that the merger is subject to approval by LIN's stockholders and various regulatory authorities, as well as other conditions.    Analysts said the merger was meant to thwart McCaw Cellular Communication's $110-a-share cash takeover bid for LIN. McCaw gained 1 to 39 1/2. The activity pushed the Nasdaq Utility Index, which includes cellular stocks, up 2.25 to 746.44, making it the strongest sector in the OTC market yesterday.    Novell climbed 1 1/8 to 26 1/8 on volume of about 750,000 shares. The company reported net income for its third quarter, ended July 29, of 35 cents a share, compared with year-earlier earnings of 37 cents a share. Last month, the company said its net income for the quarter might be below 35 cents a share.    Novell's competitor, 3Com, slipped 3/4 to 14 1/8 on 473,000 shares. Network General, which makes computer-networking software, added 3/4 to 20 3/8.    ASK Computer Systems dropped 2 1/4 to 8 3/8 after the company announced that its earnings for the first quarter ending Sept. 30 will be &quot;substantially below&quot; the 18 cents a share earned a year earlier. A soft market and delays in some customer approvals were blamed for the decline in profits.    Among other active stocks, MCI Communications rose 1/8 to 41 3/4; Intel was unchanged at 29 3/4; Apple Computer improved 3/4 to 45 3/4 and MiniScribe dropped 3/16 to 2 1/16. Nike was up 1 1/2 to 56 7/8. </TEXT></DOC>
