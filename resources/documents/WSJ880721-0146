But then, he has never met Willy Schaap, with whom he shares a great deal.    &quot;I've been living here in Mayfair for 42 years and, I'll tell you, I'm not going anywhere,&quot; Mr. van Wyk says from his home in the white working-class section of Johannesburg.    Seven hundred miles to the south, in the black shantytown of Lawaaikamp, Mr. Schaap, speaking Xhosa, utters almost identical words. &quot;I've been in this area for a long time and no matter what they do, I'm not leaving,&quot; he says.    Anger and defiance know no color in South Africa. Mr. van Wyk and Mr. Schaap share a dread of what will become of their neighborhoods under the government's quixotic efforts both to moderate and enforce the Group Areas Act, the pillar of apartheid that mandates residential segregation. Mr. van Wyk, battling to keep his white suburb free of Indians, wants the law to be enforced; Mr. Schaap, struggling to prevent the demolition of his township to make way for coloreds, or people of mixed race, wants the law to be scrapped.    &quot;A government can never please everybody,&quot; says Allen McCabe, another crusader to keep Mayfair white. &quot;But what our government is doing is upsetting everybody.&quot;    Pretoria's neighborhoods policy is typical of its perplexing strategy of simultaneous reform and repression. On the one hand, it is keen to show South African blacks, and the outside world, that it intends to scale back apartheid. On the other hand, it is trying to please right-wing whites by adhering to racial segregation and oppression. Thus, while government officials concede apartheid must die, they can't bring themselves to kill it.    This dilemma is reflected in the government's approach to the Group Areas Act. Changing demographics and the growing economic strength of blacks have trampled the neat residential boundaries established by the law. A severe shortage of non-white housing is pushing urban blacks into low-income white districts, while middle-class blacks, coloreds, and Indians, no longer content to live in their township ghettos, are moving into the comfortable white suburbs. Scrapping the law would merely be official acknowledgment of reality: Racial barriers can no longer contain South African society.    But such a concession would boost the fortunes of the pro-apartheid Conservative Party, which claims the support of a third of the white electorate. &quot;We know that in their hearts the government would like to scrap the act,&quot; says Mr. McCabe, a supporter of the Conservative Party. &quot;But they can't because they know that it will be their ticket out of power.&quot;    So, instead of repealing the law that has caused so much pain over the years, the government has decided to amend it in a way sure to cause more sorrow and conflict. This month, it proposed creating a limited number of &quot;open areas&quot; where people of any race can live. At the same time, it advocates a strict crackdown on any Group Areas Act violators through mandatory evictions.    As a result, Mayfair, which is already 50% Indian, will likely be declared &quot;open&quot; and Lawaaikamp will most certainly be demolished. Neither the whites of Mayfair nor the blacks of Lawaaikamp will accept this without a fight.    The Black   Mr. Schaap is no stranger to the Group Areas Act. He has moved six times in his 85 years, only twice voluntarily. &quot;I've spent my life building houses and destroying them, building and destroying,&quot; he says. &quot;It's quite enough.&quot;    His present house began as a one-room shack that he and his wife built 11 years ago. Today, it is an odd-shaped complex of 11 rooms. The flimsy wooden walls are insulated with cardboard, the stereo runs by car battery and the toilet is a bucket out back. Still, this is home.    &quot;They just want us to move because we are black,&quot; Mr. Schaap says. &quot;Well, they're going to have to take me away by force.&quot;    The nearby white municipality of George, which owns the land at Lawaaikamp, seems prepared to do just that. It has declared the land to be a colored-group area, meaning blacks are illegal squatters who will have to move a mile down the road to a new township, Sandkraal. The government-built houses of Sandkraal may be a bit sturdier, but they are considerably smaller. Mr. Schaap, as a pensioner, would have to be content with a tiny two-room house.    Three years of threats from the white authorities have prompted most of Lawaaikamp's 6,000 residents to move to Sandkraal. But about 1,500 are refusing to budge. Many have been served with eviction notices, which are now being tested in court. But should the government's new Group Areas Act amendments be adopted by parliament, the local officials can evict and bulldoze at will.    Two young residents of Lawaaikamp ponder this prospect as they look toward Sandkraal and a horizon dotted by rows of little houses under construction. &quot;They are being built for us, those who have refused to move,&quot; explains Anthony Dlepu. His friend, Solomon Mruquli, shakes his head emphatically. &quot;Not for me,&quot; he says. &quot;The only place they'll move me to in Sandkraal is the cemetery.&quot;    The White   Mr. van Wyk pounds his gavel on the podium and calls the Mayfair Residents Association meeting to order. As the chairman of the group, he begins by saying that the government can keep &quot;their bloody open areas.&quot; (Later, in private, he says, &quot;You can't put fowls and pigs into the same pen. One will kill the other.&quot;)    More than 100 whites have gathered in a grade-school auditorium to hear a government representative who never shows. Instead, a municipal candidate for the Conservative Party jumps on the stage. &quot;Look at your streets, houses and schools and you see us whites being pushed back,&quot; he says. &quot;If you vote right, we'll throw each and every Indian out next year.&quot;    The crowd roars. A young man with slicked-back hair calls for the microphone and appeals for reason. &quot;I want the Indians out too, I don't want this to be an open area,&quot; he says, trying to gain credibility. &quot;But let's try to work this out peacefully. Let's get a committee of say 10 whites and 10 Indians -- some are respectable, some are doctors -- and let's talk.&quot;    An older man sitting a row behind him leaps up shouting, &quot;Hey, Mr. Liberal Thinker.&quot; Talk, he says, hasn't done the whites any good anywhere else in Africa. &quot;What's going to happen,&quot; he asks, &quot;when our houses are surrounded right and left, front and back by the coolies?&quot; (Coolies is a derogatory term for Indians.)    The Conservative Party man has an answer. &quot;We can't deal with this as individuals,&quot; he says. &quot;If we stand together and work together, we can keep Mayfair beautiful.&quot;    To this crowd, beautiful is white. </TEXT></DOC>
