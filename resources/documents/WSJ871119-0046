ApcarStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/19/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FBT ANAT GOVMTTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)DIVIDENDS (DIV) </IN><TEXT>   The federally assisted bailout of First City Bancorp. of Texas Inc. is falling behind its initial timetable for completing the transaction, and some prominent shareholders are balking at the plan.    The recapitalization plan for the Houston banking company originally envisioned that proxy materials for a December shareholder vote would have been on their way by now to First City stockholders. Also, under the plan a tender offer for existing First City debt was expected to begin in mid-November.    That timetable, which aims at completing the bailout by year's end, was charted in a memorandum distributed to potential investors in a newly reconstituted First City during the past several weeks.    Neither of those deadlines are being met. A. Robert Abboud, the former Chicago banker who is leading the bailout, said last week that he expected to release proxy materials by yesterday. But First City now says it isn't certain when the voluminous proxy materials will be issued. It didn't give a reason for the delay but it indicated that they are unlikely to be ready this week.    Mr. Abboud wasn't available for comment yesterday. Some of those close to the transaction have said repeatedly that they don't expect any problems completing the transaction by year's end.    Under the plan, First City would receive about $1.5 billion in assistance from the Abboud investor group and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., making it the second-largest federal banking bailout after the 1984 rescue of Continental Illinois Corp. Among other things, Mr. Abboud is expected to raise at least $500 million in exchange for new First City common and preferred stock. Existing First City holders, whose holdings would be nearly wiped out, would participate in a rights offering to raise an additional $86 million.    Opposition by some major First City shareholders could torpedo the Abboud plan and lead to the bank's failure. In line with the FDIC's policy that holders of a failed bank mustn't be rescued, that would give the holders even less than the Abboud plan allows.    Still, some preferred holders don't like the way the Abboud plan treats their holdings. The terms call for four issues of First City preferred to be eliminated in exchange for about $30 million in cash, or about $8.50 a share; the ability to buy $10.7 million of First City's new common in a rights offering, and a 40.5% stake in a bank that First City plans to spin off. That bank would hold $1.79 billion in troubled assets, nonperforming and past due loans and it is expected that the 40.5% stake in the bank's stock will have little value.    Anthony E. Keim, a portfolio manager at Government Personnel Mutual Life Insurance Co., San Antonio, Texas, which holds a 9% stake in one preferred series, said the company will await the proxy materials before it decides how to vote on the proposal but &quot;it looks as if there is not much bang for the buck,&quot; in the Abboud plan. He said that under the terms of the preferred series that his company holds, First City may liquidate the shares at $48.50 each, compared with the $8.50 a share offered by the Abboud plan.    Yesterday, the Dallas Morning News reported that other preferred holders were &quot;expressing dissatisfaction&quot; with the plan including Fredrick Erck, a San Antonio banker, who holds 63.4% of one series of First City preferred, and 29% of another. Mr. Erck didn't return phone calls yesterday.    First City said that Mr. Erck had resigned from its board last week but it didn't give a reason. In addition, the bank said that Leland R. Speed, a Jackson, Miss., businessman, also resigned as a director, leaving 22 board members.    Separately, American National Insurance Co. said it lowered its stake in First City to 6.5% of the common outstanding and intends to lower its stake even further.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, American National said it sold 442,600 First City common shares from Oct. 21 to Nov. 9 for 75 cents to $1.125 each. As a result of the sales, American National holds 2,167,400 First City shares.    American National, based in Galveston, Texas, said it reduced its holdings for &quot;tax and other reasons deemed appropriate to it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
