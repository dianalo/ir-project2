The biotechnology concern said it expects Wisconsin regulators to approve the planned tests within four weeks. BioTechnica said its BioTechnica Agriculture unit plans to conduct the tests in April or May at the company's Pepin County, Wis., research station.    The microorganisms involved are an improved form of naturally occurring nitrogen-fixing bacteria, the company said. Conventional strains of the bacteria already are used by farmers to increase alfalfa yields. If field tests of the genetically altered bacteria &quot;proceed on schedule,&quot; BioTechnica said, the bacteria may be available to farmers within three years. </TEXT></DOC>
