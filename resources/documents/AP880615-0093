LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Presbyterians paused to clap and pray afteradopting a statement on ``Christian Obedience in a Nuclear Age,''then called early today to restudy the church's pro-choice abortionstance before ending a marathon meeting.   Tuesday's session at the 200th General Assembly of thePresbyterian Church (U.S.A.) began with the election of a topchurch officer and ended shortly before 2 a.m. after the assemblyvoted 250-244 to initiate a new study on abortion.   Anti-abortion groups in the 3-million-member church have soughta new study since 1985, when the denomination adopted a statementcondemning abortion as a method of birth control but concludingthat the decision remains a private one between a woman, herphysician and her conscience.   The assembly was to adjourn today after discussingdenominational finances and the location of the headquarters of thedenomination's pension board.   The commissioners overwhelmingly accepted the ChristianObedience report, prompting spontaneous applause in the CervantesConvention Center, where the delegates, called commissioners, havebeen meeting since June 7.   The report was the result of a process begun in 1983 whencongregations asked how to respond to those who refuse to pay taxesover disagreement with government action.   The paper responded that their decision should be recognized asproper ``under certain circumstances,'' and they they should begiven emotional support by the church.   Committee revisions of the paper changed language to make itclear ``it is normally the case'' that Christians obey civilauthority.   A request was left in, however, that church agencies set up aFund for Obedience to Higher Authority ``for the assistance ofthose who suffer financial loss or difficulty as result of acts ofconscience.''   The paper says nuclear war is immoral, and that nucleardeterrence ``as an adequate, permanent means to national security... is not morally defensible.''   Language added by a committee at the assembly states thatmilitary service is ``a legitimate function of civil government(and) many Presbyterians have decided that obedience to God leadsthem to participate in the military.''   Remaining on today's agenda was a recommendation to consolidatethe denomination's pension fund in Philadelphia, headquarters ofthe pension board in the United Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) thelarger of two denominations that merged in 1983 to end a 121-yeardivision.   Commissioners will consider a minority report that recommendsthe pension board move to Atlanta, site of the headquarters of thePresbyterian Church (U.S.), the smaller, Southern church in theunion.   Earlier Tuesday, the Rev. James E. Andrews was re-elected to asecond four-year term as stated clerk, or the denomination's chiefconstitutional office. By a 323-298 vote he defeated HarrietNelson, 54, a lay leader from Napa, Calif.   Andrews, 59, had to be nominated from the floor after anominating committee rejected his nomination to the $62,000-a-yearpost.   Andrews told commissioners he had been ``sent a message'' by thenarrow margin to heal the divisions in the denomination stemmingfrom the merger.   Conservatives within the denomination have blamed decliningmembership on what they perceive to be increasingly liberal stancesby the church under Andrews.   In nominating Mrs. Nelson, the Rev. J. Randolph Taylor calledAndrews ``a reminder of our divided past'' and said the ``churchneeds a sense of newness.''   Andrews, who was stated clerk of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.)from 1973 to 1983, promised to be ``very active in ... bringing invarious viewpoints, various factions together in a denominationthat's growing up.''   The stated clerk represents the church in ecumenical bodies,oversees the annual assembly and heads a staff of 65 with a budgetof about $7 million.   In other action, the assembly recommended a higher federalminimum wage and called for a national dialogue on the status ofAmericans Indians. It also considered suggested actions on healthcosts and religious freedom.   The assembly adopted a lengthy paper on pornography thatconcludes its fundamental cause is sexism. The recommendationsreiterate the church's call for the enactment of the Equal RightsAmendment and direct church officials to develop a public policystatement on pornography.</TEXT></DOC>
