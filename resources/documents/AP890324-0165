(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge set a $100,000 bond Friday forTimothy Jacobs, one of two Indian activists acquitted of federalcharges and later charged by the state for holding up to 20hostages at a newspaper last year.   Jacobs, 20, was returned from Madison County, N.Y., Thursdaynight to face 14 second-degree kidnapping charges. He dropped hisfight against extradition Wednesday after a New York appeals courtrefused to block the order sending him home.   Superior Court Judge Anthony Brannon set bond for Jacobs andappointed him a lawyer during a hearing at the courthouse barely ablock from The Robesonian newspaper, where Jacobs and Eddie Hatcherheld hostages for 10 hours on Feb. 1, 1988.   Both were found innocent of federal hostage-taking and firearmsviolations after a three-week trial in Raleigh last October. Butthey were indicted by a Robeson County grand jury last December onstate kidnapping charges.   Jacobs fled soon afterward to the Onondaga Indian reservationsouth of Syracuse, N.Y., but was captured Dec. 13 after ahigh-speed chase. Hatcher was arrested in North Carolina, but fledthe state after the National Council of Churches posted a $25,000bond for him. He first went to New York, then to an Indianreservation in Idaho.   Hatcher tried earlier this month to seek political asylum at theSoviet consulate in San Francisco. But the Soviets rejected hisplea and turned him out of their building, allowing federal agentsto arrest him. He is being held in a jail in Oakland, Calif.   Jacobs' family said they would find the money to get himreleased.   ``The money is no problem,'' said Eleanor Jacobs, Timothy'smother. ``Timmy was hoping to be home for Easter. But with theholiday today and the short amount of notice we had, we just didn'thave everything ready.''   A bond can be secured with cash or a deed to property. Jacobs'parents own their own home in Robeson County.   The two Tuscarora Indians said they took over the newspaper todraw attention to their charges of official corruption anddrug-dealing by Robeson County officials. A state task force formedas a result of the takeover found no evidence to support thoseallegations.   Jacobs said before his court appearance he would plead guilty toone of the kidnapping counts, provided he received probation withno prison sentence. He said he would not testify against Hatcher,31.   District Attorney Richard Townsend, who made no commentsopposing bond for Jacobs, said he would not accept that kind ofplea bargain.   ``I don't think we're interested in that at this point,''Townsend said. ``We feel all of the charges need to be disposed of.It might be something we would discuss at a later time, but notnow.''   Townsend said he hoped to try Jacobs and Hatcher at the sametime.   A decision is expected Monday whether to return Hatcher to NorthCarolina to face a federal charge of unlawful flight to avoidprosecution or to drop the federal charge and begin extraditionproceedings on the state charges in California.   Hatcher said this week that Jacobs was abandoning ``the cause''by dropping his extradition battle in New York. Mrs. Jacobs saidFriday she had hoped her son would continue that fight, but sheunderstood why he dropped it.   ``He said he just got tired of fighting and wanted to get itover with,'' she said. ``I can understand that.''</TEXT></DOC>
