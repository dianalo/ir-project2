Dade Circuit Judge Frederick N. Barad also denied custody ofCrystal Lynn DeMetro to her maternal grandparents, saying they wereunfit to take care of her, and returned the case to Juvenile Court.   ``All four contestants for this child are in need ofpsychotherapy. They all have personality disorders,'' Barad said ina nine-page ruling.   Judy and Richard DeMetro, accused of buying the girl, tried togain legal custody of Crystal after the state Department of Healthand Rehabilitative Services asked that she be given to her maternalgrandparents.   The DeMetros allegedly gave Crystal's natural mother CamaraHeistand a total of $1,100 in $100 bills, clothing, a box of candyand a plan ticket and went through an elaborate name-change rusewith the mother's cooperation.   ``In summary, the DeMetros spun a web of deceit, and the courtcannot permit the child to be caught in that web,'' Barad said.   ``I'm very disappointed, and I want my baby back,'' said JudyDeMetro, wiping away tears and walking away from reporters.   HRS spokesman Michael Powers said, ``Basically, it goes back tothe beginning, except in a different arena.''   Crystal's fate now rests with the county Juvenile Court, whichwill determine if she should become a ward of the state and becomeeligible for adoption. She will remain in a foster home where shehas lived since the judge took Crystal away from the DeMetros inMiami in June.   No one has been excluded as adoptive parents.   The grandparents, Chad and Carol Dornsife, of South Lake Tahoe,Calif., began a nationwide search for Crystal after learning theirgranddaughter had been given up in 1987.   The Dornsifes claim the DeMetros are gypsies and their life styleis inappropriate for Crystal.   ``Simply, the Dornsifes have not demonstrated that they couldprovide the necessary care, attention, shelter and a moralenvironment that would be conducive to and serve the best interestsof Crystal,'' the judge said.   The mother doesn't want the child, and the father is unknown.   Lester Langer, a Miami attorney representing the Dornsifes, saidthe judge's order was incorrect but expected. He called the order apartial victory because it allows the Dornsifes more time to presenttheir case for adoption.</TEXT></DOC>
