The proposed revisions would providefor automatic approval of applications by insured institutions for approvalof routine reorganizations involving the creation of savings and loan holdingcompanies subject to specified requirements. Such applications would beautomatically approved 30 calendar days after the filing of the applicationunless the Board or its delegate has either requested additional informationfrom the applicant in writing, notified the applicant that the applicationis materially deficient and will not be processed, or denied the application.The revisions also provide for a corresponding streamlined approval forpermission to organize an interim federal institution for insurance ofaccounts, for Federal Home Loan Bank Membership and merger of any interiminstitution that is used as a component of the reorganization transaction.In order to qualify for automatic approval under the proposed revisions,an application must involve only the creation of a holding company by aninsured institution and no other transaction incident thereto (other thanuse of an interim institution and merger with such interim), and the applicantcompany must not also be seeking any waivers, forebearances, or resolutionof legal or supervisory issues. In addition, the capitalization of theholding company must not exceed the lesser of the amount that the insuredinstitution in question could pay in dividends, or the amount that theinstitution could invest in its service corporation. In addition, the boardof directors and executive officers of the new holding company must becomprised of persons who are, at the time of the reorganization, executiveofficers and directors of the institution, although they need not holdthe same positions and all executive officers and directors of the institutionneed not also be executive officers and directors of the holding company.In a policy statement dated August 12, 1988 (<T3>See </T3>53 FR 31761 (August 19, 1988)), the Board provided guidanceon the extent to which savings and loan holding companies should be requiredto contribute financial assistance to their subsidiary insured institutionsand, in particular, whether a proposed acquiror of an insured institutionwould be required to execute a regulatory capital maintenance agreementas a condition to receiving approval of a proposed acquisition. For thereasons set forth in the policy statement, a proposed acquiror has theoption of executing either (i) a regulatory capital maintenance agreementproviding for a specified dollar cap on the amount of the acquiror's maintenanceobligation, or (ii) a so-called ``prenuptial'' agreement, which providesfor the transfer to the FSLIC of the right to vote the securities of theinstitution, remove the board of directors of the institution, cause additionalsecurities of the institution to be issued to the FSLIC, or dispose ofany or all of the securities of the institution owned by the acquiror,in the event the institution's capital level declines below a specifiedlevel. The Board's Office of Regulatory Activities (``ORA''), in ThriftBulletin No. 5 dated October 19, 1988, issued guidelines on, among otherthings, the amount of the dollar cap that will generally be required ina regulatory capital maintenance agreement and, with respect to prenuptialagreements, the minimum capital level that must be maintained by the institutionin order to avoid triggering the transfer to FSLIC of the various powersdescribed above. Agreements that exceed the scope of these guidelines areconsidered to present significant policy issues that warrant considerationby the Board itself. Accordingly, in order to qualify for automatic approvalunder the proposed revisions, the Board is proposing that the proposedreorganization transaction not raise a significant policy issue as describedin the Board's August 12, 1988 policy statement or the ORA guidelines ofOctober 19, 1988. Thus, the proposed holding company in the reorganizationwould generally be required to submit, prior to consummation of the reorganization,either a ``dollar capped'' regulatory capital maintenance agreement ora ``prenuptial'' agreement that, in either case, is consistent with theBoard's policy statement and the ORA guidelines.In addition to the foregoing requirements, the Board also is proposingto require the holding company to file certain certifications and opinionswith the insured institution's Supervisory Agent within a specified timebefore or after the consummation of the acquisition. These certificationsand opinions are customarily required to be filed by holding companiescompleting the prior approval process under current Board regulations.The proposed requirements would be as follows:(1) On the business day prior to the date of consummation of the acquisition,the chief financial officers of the holding company and the insured institutionshall certify to the Supervisory Agent in writing that no material adverseevents or material adverse changes have occurred with respect to the financialcondition or operations of the holding company or the insured institutionsince the date of the financial statements submitted with the application;(2) No later than thirty days from the date of consummation of the acquisition,the holding company shall file with the Supervisory Agent a certificationby legal counsel stating the effective date of the acquisition, the exactnumber of shares of stock of the insured institution acquired by the holdingcompany, and that the acquisition has been consummated in accordance withthe provisions of all applicable laws and regulations and the application;(3) No later than thirty days from the date of consummation of the acquisition,the holding company shall file with the Supervisory Agent an opinion fromits independent auditors certifying that the transaction was consummatedin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and(4) No later than thirty days from the date of consummation of the acquisition,the holding company shall file with the Supervisory Agent a certificationstating that the holding company will not cause the insured institutionto deviate materially from the business plan submitted in connection withthe application, unless prior written approval from the Supervisory Agentis obtained.Finally, the proposal would require that the proposed acquisition be consummatedwithin 120 days after the application is automatically approved pursuantto 12 CFR 574.7(a)(1).The Board believes that the proposed revisions would further expedite andstreamline the application process under Part 574 by reducing substantiallythe processing period for routine holding company reorganization applications.Commenters are invited to address all aspects of the proposal, includingthe conditions that would apply to automatically approved applications.Specifically, the Board seeks comment on whether such conditions shouldbe included at all or whether the rules should be expanded, modified, ordeleted in part. To the extent that deletion of a requirement is recommended,commenters are requested to address whether any substitute is necessary.Finally, commenters are asked to identify any requirements that shouldbe promulgated in the form of supervisory guidance.Finally, the Board notes that the proposal provides that in cases wherethe insured institution has converted from mutual to stock form, the institution'snewly formed holding company will become subject to certain post-conversionrequirements that are applicable to the institution itself pursuant tovarious sections of the Board's mutual to stock conversion regulations.This treatment of the holding company simply insures that creation of aholding company will not be used as a route to evade such post-conversionsafeguards. These safeguards, which pertain to post-conversion acquisitionsof an institution's stock, purchases and sale of conversion stock by theinstitution's officers and directors, registration of the stock under theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, the existence of market-makers in theinstitution's stock, and restrictions on certain stock repurchases, havecustomarily been imposed as conditions of approval of holding company applicationswhere converted institutions reorganize into holding company structure.Treatment of this area in the regulation avoids the need for such a cumbersomeconditioning process.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 574</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Holding companies, Savings and loanassociations, Securities.Accordingly, the Board hereby proposes to amend Part 574, Subchapter D,Charter V, Title 12, <T3>Code of Federal Regulations,</T3> as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="72">SUBCHAPTER D_FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 574_ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF INSURED INSTITUTIONS</ITAG>1.
