Widespread doubts about the wisdom of becoming a member of the EC in 1973 prompted the government to hold a referendum two years later on whether to stay.    Now, as the 12-nation economic group tries to create a single unified market by 1992, Britain's commitment to the European ideal continues to lag behind that of its big continental partners. A survey of senior European executives by The Wall Street Journal/Europe and the management consulting firm Booz-Allen andamp; Hamilton Inc. shows Britons are doing less than their French and West German counterparts to prepare for the transition. And British executives remain highly suspicious of the EC, the survey shows.    &quot;Many people in the U.K. still feel somehow Europe is somewhere else; they aren't part of it,&quot; says Dirk Hudig, manager for EC affairs at Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries PLC. &quot;I don't think many of them have realized the competitive implications&quot; of 1992, he adds.    The unified market plan is a package of some 300 proposed laws for the EC designed to free the movement of goods, capital and people among the 12 member countries. The idea is to enable companies to take advantage of a single market of 320 million people.    But just 20% of British executives in the survey have undertaken or plan to undertake mergers to prepare for 1992, compared with 31% of the West German and 50% of the French. And only one-fourth the British respondents said they have changed &quot;cost structures&quot; or plan to do so, compared with one-third of the West Germans and half the French.    The British government wants to drum up more enthusiasm. Lord Young, the trade and industry secretary, has vowed to boost awareness of the unified market to 90% of companies interviewed by the end of this year from a scant 16% last year. His department recently mailed glossy booklets outlining the project to 130,000 British executives.    But Lord Young faces an uphill task. Britons bristle at the notion of interference by EC bureaucrats and politicians. Asked in the survey if the single market would shift power from national governments to the European Parliament, 62% of Britons agreed it would, compared with 54% of French and 48% of West German executives.    Most of the European executives who responded to the survey favor the plan, believing it will lead to lower transportation costs and easier shipment of goods across national borders, easier transfer of executives and managers from one EC country to another, fairer government-procurement policies, less paperwork and lower costs for services such as insurance.    But many of the executives say competing on world markets has already forced them to restructure, so the plan probably will have only a marginal impact on their operations. Few claim to be taking concrete new steps to get ready for its arrival. The 1992 deadline &quot;won't make that much difference,&quot; says Ib Goldschmidt, a member of the managing board of International Service System AS of Denmark.    A spokesman for U.K.-based Pilkington PLC, Europe's biggest glassmaker, agrees. He says the company's cost-savings from the eventual removal of customs barriers are &quot;not going to be enormous -- less than 5%. That will be true of most heavy industry,&quot; he predicts.    EC officials admit they are getting less support from industry than they had hoped. A senior aide to Lord Cockfield, the EC commissioner who was the principal author of the single-market plan, expects companies to wake up to the opportunities within a year. But he adds &quot;there's a limit to bringing horses to water and trying to give them drinking lessons.&quot;    Other single-market advocates are blunter. Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, head of the EC business-lobbying group Unice in Brussels, says anyone who thinks 1992 won't affect his company &quot;is replying out of Euroskepticism and suffering from ignorance.&quot;    Some British executives say their cynicism toward the EC merely reflects their government's attitude. They question how committed to Europe Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is. Her rows with fellow heads of government at EC summits are legendary. The one in February, at which she called the French &quot;crazy,&quot; is only the most recent example.    Mrs. Thatcher &quot;accepts the inevitability of Europe in her head,&quot; says an official at a big U.K. retailer. &quot;But in her heart, there beats a nationalist.&quot;    The business shakeout many executives expect after 1992 could well force Britain to become a true part of Europe. But that depends on how companies react to the onslaught of competition.    &quot;There are two strategies: Either I will defend the white cliffs of Dover to the death, or it's D-Day, 1944&quot; and time to attack the competition, says Kent Price, chief executive of Chloride Group PLC, a U.K. battery maker. &quot;Entrepreneurial people will become aware of the opportunities beyond the white cliffs of Dover. The others won't.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
