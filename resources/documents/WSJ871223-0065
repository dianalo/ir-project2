But trading was light, and several analysts said they were encouraged that bonds held up as well as they did. Also, the bond markets are likely to receive a lift, at least temporarily, from an agreement announced late last night among the seven major industrial nations that the dollar has fallen far enough.    The U.S. and six other countries, in a long statement negotiated by telephone over the past few weeks, implied they would intervene in the currency markets to stabilize the dollar. The finance ministers and central bank governors agreed that &quot;either excessive fluctuation of exchange rates, a further decline of the dollar, or a rise in the dollar to an extent that becomes destabilizing . . . could be counterproductive by damaging growth prospects in the world economy.&quot;    Widespread speculation that such an accord would come soon bolstered bond prices late last week and may have helped support the credit markets yesterday. Although some traders expressed disappointment Monday that nothing had happened over the weekend, many economists remained optimistic that an agreement was imminent.    For example, Robert Brusca, chief economist of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc., predicted Monday that an agreement to stabilize the dollar near current levels was &quot;inevitable&quot; and that it would &quot;really help the bond market.&quot;    Still, the oil-price jump yesterday startled bond traders. Prices of long-term Treasury bonds declined slightly more than one-quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Most short-term interest rates drifted lower. &quot;Given the fact that the price of oil kicked back up, the bond market did pretty well,&quot; said Robert H. Chandross, vice president and chief economist at Lloyds Bank in New York.    Oil, which is viewed by many investors as an important symbol of inflation pressures, has dominated the credit markets lately. Last week, bond prices soared as oil prices fell sharply. Prices of 30-year Treasury bonds, for example, soared 5 5/8 points, their biggest one-week rally since the week the stock market fell apart in October, according to Peter Niculescu, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc.    Bonds also received a boost last week from growing evidence of friction within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, prompting many oil specialists to prophesy further oil-price declines.    This week, though, bond prices have given back part of their gains. One leading factor was a move by Congress to increase the government's limit on long-term bond issuance, thus enabling the Treasury to sell new 30-year bonds in early February as part of its quarterly financing operation.    &quot;The market, while it didn't have an up day, performed very well considering the news about higher oil prices and the lower dollar&quot; as well as the government's increased limit on bond issuance, said Peter Bass, a managing director at S.G. Warburg Securities Inc.    The Treasury yesterday sold $9.29 billion of new two-year notes at an average annual yield of 7.93%. That was up from 7.76% at the previous two-year note auction Nov. 18 and was the highest since an average of 7.95% Oct. 21.    Today, the department will sell about $7 billion of four-year notes. Dealers yesterday estimated the average yield on these notes will be about 8 3/8%.    The price of the Treasury's latest 30-year bonds fell to 98 8/32 from 98 18/32 Monday. Its yield rose to 9.04% from 9.01%. The government's latest 10-year notes declined to 99 18/32 from 99 28/32, while the yield rose to 8.94% from 8.89%.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds hovered in a narrow range all day, winding up with a small decline of 2.03 points at 1243.71. It ranged between 1241.34 and 1244.80.    The federal funds rate fell slightly, averaging just over 6 3/4%. On Monday, the rate on funds, which are reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged 6.82%. Many traders expect a temporary surge in the funds rate next week. The funds rate often soars during the last few days of each year, as banks and other companies scramble to spruce up their year-end balance sheets.    Rates declined yesterday on short-term Treasury bills. The rate on the latest three-month Treasury bills declined to 5.91% bid from an average of 5.96% set at Monday's government auction. The rate on the latest six-month bills fell to 6.46% bid from 6.48%.    The Commerce Department yesterday reported that new orders for durable goods rose less than 0.1% in November. Many economists had expected a decline. A survey of nine economists earlier this week by the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report showed an average estimate of a 0.2% decrease. Nevertheless, traders said the report had little effect on bond prices, partly because the durable goods statistics are notoriously volatile from month to month.    In the municipal market, a $488.7 million offering of refunding bonds by the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia was offered to investors. The bonds carry a 6 1/2% rate and were priced at par to the initial mandatory put date of Dec. 1 of next year, according to First Boston Corp., which heads the underwriters.    Here are details of the Treasury's auction yesterday of two-year notes:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.                          2-Year Notes    Applications                            $30,850,540,000    Accepted bids                            $9,286,315,000    Accepted at low price                               23%    Accepted noncompetitively                  $822,000,000    Average price (Rate)                      99.900(7.93%)    High price (Rate)                         99.918(7.92%)    Low price (Rate)                          99.882(7.94%)    Interest rate                                    7 7/8%    The notes are dated Dec. 31, 1987, and mature Dec. 31,1989.</TEXT></DOC>
