But LarsRamqvist isn't even breaking into a light sweat.   The chief executive of Swedish telecommunications giantTelefon AB L.M. Ericsson is at a news conference at the SouthStreet Seaport to talk about a new $250 millioncellular-phone project that is a huge embarrassment to one ofEricsson's biggest competitors -- Motorola Inc. Metro One, aNew York cellular-service operator, has hired Ericsson toreplace its aging Motorola-made network.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Now five million of the 12 million cellular phones in theworld are served by systems using Ericsson equipment,&quot; saysMr. Ramqvist.   As telecommunications-equipment companies go, Ericsson isthe quintessential global player. A shrewd product strategyand adroit politicking keep the Ericsson machine hummingconfidently in more than 80 countries.   Lately, however, the financial strains of sustainingEricsson's rapid expansion are becoming increasingly clear.&quot;They've grown so fast, and when you grow fast there's alwaysa tendency to get stretched too thin,&quot; says Kevin Brau, aLondon-based telecommunications analyst for Credit SuisseFirst Boston Inc. He questions Ericsson's &quot;projectmanagement. Working in so many product areas where there's somuch happening, can they get enough good people and keeptight enough control?&quot;   Ericsson's pretax profit in this year's first half tumbled26% to 1.78 billion Swedish kronor (US$290 million) from 2.4billion kronor the previous year. Revenue was virtually flatat 22.46 billion kronor, and orders plunged. But Mr. Ramqviststeamed ahead with an aggressive product-development program.(Ericsson's 1990 revenue was 45.7 billion kronor, a 16%increase from 1989's 39.55 billion kronor.)   This year's technological budget, which includes research,new-product development and systems adaptations forindividual markets, will soar nearly two billion kronor to 10billion kronor (US$1.6 billion) -- or 18% of projected sales.Among the company's development projects arepublic-telecommunications equipment for the cutthroat U.S.market; new-generation digital cellular systems designed forthe U.S., European and Japanese markets; and pocketphones,which Ericsson needs to bolster sagging sales of itsoffice-phone systems used by corporations.   Ericsson's cash flow turned negative in the first sixmonths, reflecting additional outlays of about one billionkronor for a pair of acquisitions during the period. Aforecast for lower profit before tax this year hasdisappointed many investors and trimmed Ericsson'sonce-highflying share price.   None of this is stopping Mr. Ramqvist. While bigger rivalssuch as Alcatel N.V. or Siemens AG can subsidizetelecommunications activities with profits from otherdivisions, &quot;Ericsson has only one leg, telecommunications --and no big home market,&quot; he says in an interview atEricsson's Stockholm headquarters. Development &quot;costs thisyear and next year will stay on a very high level regardlessof what happens in the market. That could be reflected in theshort-term profit -- but we'll take it with open eyes.&quot;   Mr. Ramqvist, 52 years old, epitomizes the Ericssonculture, which blends technological acumen and a cannysalesmanship. The Ericsson chief holds a doctorate insolid-state physics, is a jazz-saxophone buff and, as amember of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, helps select NobelPrize science laureates. But he also likes to have a personalhand in wooing big customers such as Craig O. McCaw, chairmanof Metro One's parent, McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. ofKirkland, Wash.   While he is in only his second year as chief executive,Mr. Ramqvist has molded strategy for many years. He isgenerally credited as the architect of Ericsson's mid-1980sturnaround, which included, in 1987, pulling out of adisastrous, money-losing foray into computers and stayingfocused on telecommunications.   &quot;If we had continued going in too many directions, therewouldn't be an Ericsson today,&quot; he says. &quot;I told the board atthat time that it wouldn't be an easy ride, that we wouldspend much more on Randamp;D in the future even if we went back toonly telecommunications.&quot;   That kind of straight talk got Mr. Ramqvist installed in1987 as head of the radio-communications division -- whichincludes the booming cellular business. Then last year, whenEricsson's previous chief executive officer, Bjorn Svedberg,moved up to the chairmanship, the board passed overmore-senior executives and tapped Mr. Ramqvist.   His rise through the radio-communications side of thecompany -- rather than via public telecommunications, likenearly all of his predecessors -- was an important signalabout Ericsson's future.   Ericsson, which was founded in 1876, the same yearAlexander Graham Bell invented his telephone, began a bigexpansion outside Sweden in the early 20th century and in thepast few years has made the most of an equipment-buying bingeby Western European phone companies. Today it holds loftymarket shares in such countries as Spain and Italy -- whereit gets prices up to four times higher than similar productsfetch in the U.S. In fact, some industry analysts estimatethat Spain and Italy accounted for nearly 40% of 1990operating profit at Ericsson's biggest division, publictelecommunications.   Most striking, though, has been Ericsson's success infast-growing cellular. After helping to build the world'sbiggest cellular system in Scandinavia, Ericsson used theproceeds to tackle the rest of the world market. TodayEricsson has 60% of the Western European market and 40% ofthe world cellular-equipment market. In the U.S., thanks totriumphs like New York's Metro One, Ericsson is steadilyclosing in on Motorola.   Radio-communications equipment sales have more thanquadrupled to 11.3 billion kronor last year from 2.5 billionkronor in 1985, while operating profit has more than tripledto 886 million kronor from 253 million kronor. Mr. Brau ofCredit Suisse First Boston says these numbers indicate thatthe radio-communications division will become Ericsson'sbiggest unit, passing public telecommunications, by about1994.   Ericsson will need cellular because demand forpublic-switching equipment is slackening both in Europe andin the U.S., where Ericsson is close to attaining its goal of10% of the market. &quot;Growth has slowed right down and will befairly flat throughout Europe for the next three or fouryears,&quot; says John Dinsdale, a European telecommunicationsanalyst for Dataquest Ltd.   Moreover, stiffer competition, combined with deregulationresulting from the European Community's 1992 single-marketplan, is expected to shave fat margins in such places asSpain and Italy.   Much of the pricing pressure is coming from giant globalrivals such as American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. andNorthern Telecom Ltd., which have made significant inroads inthe past year in countries that have traditionally beenEricsson strongholds. Mr. Ramqvist acknowledges: &quot;In ourplanning we anticipate a squeezing in the pricing levelregardless of the economic climate.&quot;   Even if cellular sales continue to grow strongly, fewanalysts are expecting the heady profit margins of theprevious decade. Unlike older-technology analog systems,which locked customers into proprietary systems from Ericssonor its rivals, newer digital systems will work with equipmentfrom any supplier. This should allow users to mix theirequipment purchases; it will level the playing field -- andshave profit margins -- for manufacturers. Alcatel, a unit ofAlcatel Alsthom, and Siemens, which missed the opening leg ofthe cellular race, see digital as a way to catch up now.   Obsessed with being first in the market and wary of hisrivals' deep pockets, Mr. Ramqvist is pouring most ofEricsson's development funds into digital cellular.   It seems to be paying off. So far, Ericsson has confoundedanalysts by nabbing a 40% share of orders for the new GlobalSystem for Mobile Communications, or GSM, networks in variousEuropean countries. And Mr. Ramqvist says the company will beready to supply full-fledged digital cellular systems in theU.S. by year end.   To cement Ericsson's presence in digital cellular, Mr.Ramqvist is even investing in his customers. Early this year,Ericsson paid #45 million (US$78 million) for a 50% stake inOrbitel Mobile Communications Ltd, the equipment-making armof Britain's Racal Telecom PLC. Besides adding prized Randamp;Dclout on the cellular side, the Orbitel acquisition tightenedlinks with Racal Telecom, one of Ericsson's biggest cellularcustomers.   Mr. Ramqvist says Ericsson is scouting for similarpartnerships in Germany and Japan, huge markets where thecompany is relatively weak.   ---   Mr. Moore is a special correspondent for The Wall StreetJournal Europe, based in Stockholm.
