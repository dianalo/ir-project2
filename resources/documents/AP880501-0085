When First RepublicBank Corp. began having problems in March,federal regulators guranteed all of its deposits _ including $7.6billion worth of deposits that exceeded the $100,000 per accountlimit insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.   But businessman Randy Smith, whose Cecil Carr Construction Co.had $202,000 in Park West Bank of Plano when the bank failed inAugust 1985, said the company had yet to recover $86,000 of thedeposits that exceeded the $100,000 cap.   ``It's a horror story,'' Smith told the Dallas Times Herald.``Everyone knew that the FDIC would bail out First Republic'sdepositors, but Park West's uninsured depositors were left to havetheir throats cut.''   ``We were dealing with a widespread crisis of confidence atFirst Republic,'' countered FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney, whoseagency pumped $1 billion into the troubled banker to help offset aserious runoff of deposits. ``We had no choice.''   Since the start of 1985, 2,980 accounts at 28 failed Texas bankshave not been fully covered by the FDIC. In those closings, $58million in uninsured deposits have been placed at risk of not beingcovered by the FDIC.   The state's independent bankers say federal regulators arediscriminating against small bank depositors and small banks.   They contend that regulators close small troubled banks whilegiving multibillion-dollar bailouts to giants such as FirstRepublicBank and First City Bancorporation of Texas.   ``The federal regulators are our judges, jury andexecutioners,'' says F. Hagen McMahon Jr., director of theIndependent Bankers Association of Texas, which represents about1,400 independent Texas banks. ``They are not closing the largebanks, they are closing our banks.''   William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, said the only solutionfor failed small banks was to close them and either pay off insureddeposits or transfer the accounts to another institution and giveuninsured depositors a claim against recoveries made in liquidatingthe failed banks' assets.   The unworkable alternative, he said, would be to take over andoperate each of the 140 U.S. banks that failed since 1985 andcouldn't be sold.   Regulators say that small-bank depositors aren't suffering asmuch as Texas bankers contend. In the 109 Texas bank failures sincethe beginning of 1985, about $11.2 billion in deposits either weretransferred to acquiring institutions or paid off 100 percent,Whitney said.   Of the $50 million in uninsured deposits in closed banks, theFDIC expects ultimately to repay $34 million, giving uninsureddepositors a loss of $16 million, or 32 cents per uninsured dollar.   ``Very few depositors lose money in small bank failures,''Seidman said.   But McMahon said the smaller bankers have suffered nevertheless,while the FDIC pumped $50 million into Dallas-based BancTexasGroup, $1 billion into First City and $1 billion into FirstRepublicBank.   ``Let us point out that our bankers live in the same economy asthe bankers working for First Republic,'' McMahon said in an openletter to Congress and regulators. ``We are exasperated with thetwo-tier treatment that is dished out by the federal regulatorybodies.''</TEXT></DOC>
