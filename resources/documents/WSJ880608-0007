Chief Executive Officer James W. Kinnear, in an interview, called the stock repurchase program &quot;significant,&quot; saying it will involve the lion's share of the $1.7 billion being budgeted. The payout most likely would be made in &quot;a single lump sum&quot; sometime before year end and may involve cash or the use of securities in anticipation of future asset sales.    Wall Street wasn't impressed. Texaco finished at $51 a share, up just 12.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was about 1.9 million shares.    &quot;It's a positive move for Texaco, but it would be a lot more positive if the company would just pay it all out in a special dividend of $6.80 a share,&quot; said Frederick Leuffer, senior oil analyst for C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. &quot;The market is disappointed because there are a lot of uncertainties in a stock-repurchase plan, such as at what price will shares be bought back, when, and so on.&quot;    Mr. Leuffer said that if the $1.7 billion were paid out in a special dividend, Texaco's share price would climb as high as $54 a share.    Sources say that a stock repurchase plan will likely be combined with some kind of special dividend, possibly valued at $3 a share.    If the entire $1.7 billion were used to repurchase stock, Texaco could buy back 33.3 million shares, or nearly 14% of its 243 million shares, at the current market price of about $51 a share.    &quot;That's an insult,&quot; said dissident shareholder Carl C. Icahn yesterday in an interview. &quot;I'm willing to buy back all of the shares at $60.&quot; Separately, in a statement, he called Texaco's restructuring efforts &quot;inadequate, self-serving and surely not rapid.&quot; He also said, &quot;Texaco management will promise almost anything to keep me off the board and to keep stockholders from voting for $60 or better.&quot;    Mr. Icahn, who is locked in a proxy battle with the oil giant, is trying to unseat five of Texaco's 14 directors up for election at Texaco's June 17 annual meeting. The New York investor has offered to acquire the company for $60 a share, but his proposal was rebuffed by the company's board.    The company also broadened the scope of assets that will be sold as part of its restructuring, suggesting more strongly than ever before that Texaco Canada Ltd. will be sold, merged or placed into some type of a joint venture arrangement.    Mr. Kinnear declined to elaborate further on the Canadian unit's role in the company's restructuring efforts. However, individuals close to the Canadian unit say that Texaco will either sell its 78% interest in the company or work out a joint venture plan. Texaco is already negotiating with several companies, one individual familiar with the talks said.    At least four companies have in the past expressed interest in acquiring the Toronto-based unit, the same individual said. These include Husky Oil Ltd., Sun Co., Gulf Canada Resources and Occidental Petroleum Co.'s Canadian unit. Several of these companies are &quot;in the running,&quot; said the same individual, who declined to say whether there were any additional suitors.    Yesterday's announcement followed by one day the sale of Texaco's West German unit to a large utility company based in Essen, West Germany, for $1.23 billion. The transaction was the first step in Texaco's restructuring efforts to be completed. &quot;With the DTA {Deutsche Texaco AG} deal done, we thought now is the time to let out&quot; how Texaco intends to use the proceeds, Mr. Kinnear said in the interview.    In addition to asset sales, Texaco also said that its restructuring program included &quot;an internal reorganization, overhead reduction and improved operating efficiency.&quot; Although Mr. Kinnear said that there would be &quot;no widespread layoffs,&quot; the number of employees would be reduced as assets are sold and operations merged into joint ventures. For example, the Deutsche Texaco sale lopped 4,000 employees off Texaco's global work force of about 50,000 employees.    Mr. Kinnear also hinted that the ranks of middle management might be further pared. Because &quot;I've delegated a lot of authority into the fields, we don't need all those checkers checking checkers here at the headquarters,&quot; he said.    The broad outline of the plan to share restructuring proceeds with shareholders received unanimous board approval at a meeting Friday. But Mr. Kinnear said that it would be at least three months before any distribution plan is implemented.    Now that the company has committed itself to a payout, it is trying to work out the details of how the disbursement would be structured. Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. and Dillon Reed have already done &quot;some preliminary number crunching,&quot; said one individual familiar with the planning.    One option under consideration would involve a share-repurchase plan that would involve a payout of both cash and either convertible notes or preferred stock. The securities could be cashed in as asset sales are completed. &quot;That would allow Texaco to reward shareholders before actually having the money in hand,&quot; one Texaco partisan said.    The oil company broadened the scope of possible asset sales to include additional U.S. oil and gas properties considered marginal as well as certain refining and marketing properties in Europe and West Africa.    Texaco already has 60 million barrels of U.S. oil and gas reserves on the block. Buyers have been narrowed to three bidders. Completion of that sale, which is expected to bring in more than $350 million, is expected this month.    The company also expects to be able to announce the completion of joint ventures involving certain U.S. refining and marketing operations with Saudi Arabia and possibly Venezuela late this month. Draft agreements have already been drawn up, but remain unsigned as both sides study the details. Any joint-venture transactions could be valued at about $1.6 billion, say individuals close to the talks, and would include special arrangements to purchase crude oil.    A transaction involving Saudi Arabia is expected to include the creation of a new company that would operate independently of either Texaco or the Saudis. However, the final outcome of negotiations on these joint ventures rests largely on whether Texaco can fight off Mr. Icahn at the annual meeting. </TEXT></DOC>
