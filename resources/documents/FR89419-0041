L. 100-485. Title II of theStatute creates a new education, training and employment program knownas the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) program undertitle IV-F of the Social Security Act. The purpose of the JOBS programis to assure that needy families with children obtain education, training,and employment that will help them avoid long term welfare dependence.Associated with participation in the JOBS program, the Statute requiresthe establishment of provisions related to on-the-job working conditions,tort claims protections, workers' compensation, displacement and grievanceprocedures to protect currently employed workers and program participants.As directed by the Statute, the Department of Health and Human Service(HHS) coordinated with the Department of Labor (DOL) to propose joint regulationson these provisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of the Regulations </ITAG>The Statute requires each State to have a JOBS program under a plan approvedby the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) no later thanOctober 1, 1990. The Statute also permits States to implement a JOBS programas early as July 1, 1989, even if implementing regulations have not beenpublished. It further requires each State to make the program availablein each subdivision of the State where it is feasible to do so by October1, 1992. At least every two years, the State must review and update itsJOBS plan and submit the updated JOBS plan to the Secretary for approval.These regulations discuss provisions in section 484 of title IV-F of theSocial Security Act (as added by section 201(b) of the Statute). Such provisionsapply both to the JOBS program and work-related activities authorized inconnection with the AFDC program under section 1115 of the Social SecurityAct. (Hereafter references to the JOBS program will also apply to suchsection 1115 activities.) These provisions require the Secretaries of Healthand Human Services and Labor to issue joint regulations with respect toon-the-job working conditions, tort claims protections, workers' compensation,and displacement as related to the JOBS program. Disputes relating to on-the-jobworking conditions, workers' compensation, and wage rates for CWEP hoursfor participants in the JOBS program are to be heard under the State agency'sfair hearing process. States are also to establish grievance proceduresfor resolving displacement complaints. Appeals of State decisions may bemade to the Administrative Law Judges, U.S. Department of Labor, underthe conditions set forth in these regulations. Section 251.1 of the regulations proposes that participants be assignedto employment and training activities within the JOBS program which theyare capable of performing on a regular basis, that they not be requiredto travel an unreasonable distance from their homes to the work and trainingsite, that they be provided necessary support services, including childcare, and that the training be appropriate. Several factors are consideredin determining the participant's capability to perform tasks on a regularbasis. The definition of unreasonable distance incorporates a standardof two hours per day commuting time, unless community standards are higher;this policy is consistent with that used under the Work Incentive (WIN)program. This section further provides that JOBS participants in work andtraining assignments will be protected by the same State and Federal healthand safety standards as other individuals in similar assignments who arenot participating in the JOBS program. Also, no person participating inthe JOBS program will be subjected to discrimination based on race, sex,national origin, religion, age or handicapping condition. Section 251.2 proposes to require that each JOBS participant in a workor training activity covered by a State workers' compensation statute orsystem will be assured of workers' compensation, including medical, accident,and income maintenance insurance, to the same extent as that availableto others who are employed in similar activities. In work assignments,such as CWEP, where workers' compensation may not be applicable, on-sitemedical and accident insurance similar to that required by the workers'compensation system must be provided. However, income maintenance insuranceis not required since the family's AFDC eligibility would not be adverselyaffected by an accident. Section 251.3 contains the provisions designed to protect currently employedworkers from displacement. Under the proposed regulations, these provisionsapply to participants in CWEP (and other work experience programs), on-the-jobtraining (OJT), and work supplementation programs because these are thecomponents which involve work activities where displacement could occur.It assures that no currently employed workers will be displaced or havethe hours of their normal work shift, wages or employment benefits reducedas the result of activities by participants in the JOBS program. Also,JOBS participants in work assignments will not impair existing contractsfor services or collective bargaining agreements and will not fill establishedunfilled positions or positions when workers are in layoff from the sameor similar positions in the organization. In addition, currently employedworkers will not be terminated in order to fill the vacancies with JOBSparticipants. JOBS participants will not infringe upon the promotionalopportunities of currently employed workers. Regarding the filling of anyestablished unfilled positions, a special displacement provision appliesto work assignments in work supplementation and CWEP. This is incorporatedin the last paragraph of this section; it does not apply to OJT or otherwork experience assignments. Section 251.4 proposes to require the State to establish grievance proceduresfor resolving displacement complaints by regular employees. Section 251.5proposes to require the State to establish a complaint procedure underthe State agency's fair hearing process to resolve disputes regarding on-the-jobworking conditions, workers' compensation and wage rates for CWEP hoursfor participants in the JOBS program. This hearing process may be establishedespecially for the purpose of resolving disputes relating to the JOBS programor it may specify that the provisions of 45 CFR 205.10, which relate tohearing and notice procedures under the AFDC program, apply to JOBS participants.Decisions by the State concerning displacement complaints under andSection;251.4 and on-the-job working conditions, workers' compensation and CWEPwage rate issues under andSection; 251.5 may be appealed to the Office ofAdministrative Law Judges, U.S. Department of Labor. The AdministrativeLaw Judges' review shall be on the record of the State proceedings andshall be limited to questions of law, and the State's findings of factshall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.Section 251.5 does not specifically define the working conditions thatmay be considered under the State agency's fair hearing process and whichmay be appealed to the Department of Labor; however, the term ``on-the-jobworking conditions'' has been used. It refers to the conditions at theplace of work. It does not refer to matters which are addressed in theassessment period prior to placement. Thus, it does not cover issues relatedto the process or outcome of orientations, assessments, employability planning,case management, job search, job development or placement activities. Nordoes it cover disputes about issues such as those related to family responsibilities,place of residence, child care and other support services needs, availabilityof resources and participant circumstances. These issues are covered underthe State agency's fair hearing process for JOBS (which are being coveredunder separate regulations) and are not appealable to the Department ofLabor.It should also be noted that andSection;251.5 of these regulations wouldrequire that a State establish and maintain a complaint procedure underthe State agency's fair hearing process to cover the wage rates used incalculating the hours of participation required of individuals in CWEP,as well as on-the-job working conditions and workers' compensation issues.However, these regulations do not include a description of how the Federalor State minimum wage, or the prevailing wage, is used to compute the numberof hours of participation in CWEP. Instead, there is a reference to section482(f) of the Social Security Act, as amended, which addresses CWEP. Sincethis process is central to the operation of CWEP, it was felt that thedescription of the computation CWEP hours more appropriately belonged inthe JOBS regulations which will be published in a separate regulatory package.When an appeal is filed with the Office of the Administrative Law Judgeswe are requesting that copies of the appeal and the administrative recordbe sent to those State and Federal agencies responsible for the issuanceof the JOBS program rules. We have also provided an opportunity for theEmployment and Training Administration, DOL; the Family Support Administration,HSS; and the State agency to file a report with the Office of AdministrativeLaw Judges. The decision of the Administrative Law Judges is the finaldecision of the Secretary of Labor on the appeal.Other provisions of JOBS contained in title II of the Statute and the provisionsin title III of the Statute regarding child care and other supportive servicesare being covered in another regulatory package. Likewise, related AFDCamendments under the Statute are being covered in a separate regulatorypackage.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Executive Order 12291Executive Order 12291 requires that a regulatory impact analysis be performedfor any ``major rule''. A major rule is one that:_Has an annual effect on the national economy of $100 million or more;_Results in a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, any industries,any government agencies, or any geographic region;_Has significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The increased expenditures authorized by the Statute will have an annualeffect on the national economy of over $100 million in the first five yearsof operations. The calculations for expenditures under the Statute arebased on the anticipation of increased expenditures in work/training programsand connected supportive services which will be partially offset by reducedwelfare costs in the long run, but it is still expected the net impactwill exceed $100 million per year in the first five years after implementation.It is envisioned that required funding levels will decrease over time asa result of the impact of the JOBS program on long-term dependency andthe number of families on AFDC.We have determined that any economic impact in excess of $100 million peryear is the result of section 201 of the Statute and not these regulations,which merely implement the statutory provisions of section 484 of titleIV-F of the Social Security Act (as added by section 201(b) of the Statute).The implementing regulations will not cause a significant change in currentexpenditure projections. For this reason, an extensive analysis of theeconomic impact of this rule is not required.Paperwork Reduction ActThe provisions of these proposed regulations do not contain informationcollection requirements as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354) requires the Federal governmentto anticipate and reduce the impact of rules and paperwork requirementson small businesses. For each particular rule, we must publish an initialanalysis describing the rule's impact on small businesses. This analysisshould indicate the purpose and reasons for the rule, the number of smallbusinesses to which it would apply, anticipated reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, possible overlap and conflict with other Federal rules, anda description of possible alternative means of accomplishing the statedobjectives which would minimize the impact on small businesses.The Secretary certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), enacted by Pub. L. 96-354,the Regulatory Flexibility Act, that these regulations, if promulgated,will not result in a significant impact on a substantial number of smallentities because the regulations primarily affect State governments andindividuals. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided inPub. L. 96-354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required. Theseregulations are issued under the authority of section 1102 of the SocialSecurity Act.Federalism and Family EffectsThe following regulations implement the requirements of the Statute regardingon-the-job working conditions, tort claims protections, workers' compensation,and displacement as related to the JOBS program. These regulations willnot have a significant effect on federalism or the family based on thecriteria cited in E.O. 12606 and E.O. 12612. <ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs: No. 13.780, AssistancePayments_Maintenance Assistance)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>We have requested that the JOBS program be added to theCatalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs, and we received a tentativeassignment of No. 13.781.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects 45 CFR Part 251</ITAG>Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Grant programs_social programs,Employment, Education, Training, Administrative practice and procedure.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Roberts T.
