Two court decisions, regulatory delays and congressional clamor have all but dashed Texas Air's goal of transforming Eastern into a low-cost carrier in time for the busy summer travel season. Analysts express concern that the delay in the high-stakes turnaround effort will only prolong the deep deficits afflicting both parent and unit.    The latest blow landed Tuesday, when a federal judge in Washington unraveled months of costly preparations for a strike that may occur if Eastern fails in its current cost-cutting negotiations with its machinists union. On the chance that Eastern's pilots might honor the machinists' picket line and ground the carrier, Eastern has been busily training replacement pilots. But Judge Barrington Parker enjoined Eastern from contracting with and training replacement pilots unless and until a strike actually occurs.    The judge left open the possibility that Eastern may hire replacement workers if the pilots walk. But the ruling is certain to extend the preparation time, perhaps by weeks or months, necessary for pilot training. Appeals of the court injunction, or a trial, would also lengthen the process.    The delays only add to Eastern's burden of resolving the machinists' talks quickly, analysts said. &quot;The further it's pushed back, the more Eastern will continue to lose . . . and the more they are going to scare away passengers with all this,&quot; said Raymond Neidl, a bond analyst for McCarthy Crisanti andamp; Maffei Inc.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Texas Air shares fell 50 cents, to $13.    In another court decision in Washington earlier this month, a federal judge blocked Eastern's sale of its profitable East Coast-shuttle to another unit of Texas Air. The sale, the judge ruled, violated the &quot;status quo&quot; provisions in Eastern's machinists contract. The decision also diminished much of Eastern's clout in negotiations by removing the threat of the transfer of major assets away from the company.    Eastern officials weren't available for interviews yesterday. In a recent speech, however, Phil Bakes, Eastern's president, took special note of the &quot;elaborate and extensive contingency plans to operate the airline&quot; in the event of a strike, plans now hamstrung by the court decisions.    &quot;Such preparation -- although expensive, time-consuming and subject to misunderstanding -- are our best insurance to raise the odds significantly that a settlement will be reached,&quot; Mr. Bakes told the Rotary Club of Atlanta.    Indeed, Texas Air and Eastern have been doing everything possible to force the machinists' talks to conclusion. Company officials are seeking an impasse declaration from the National Mediation Board, which would initiate a 30-day cooling-off period. At the end of that time the company could impose its own wage rules, or the employees could strike.    &quot;It is my firm prediction that if an agreement is to be reached, it will only happen toward the end of a 30-day cooling off period,&quot; Mr. Bakes said in the Rotary speech. The machinists, he claimed, have resisted negotiating meaningfully for months, while hurling rhetoric at Texas Air for trying to &quot;rape&quot; Eastern and impose drastically lower wages.    &quot;I suspect if we put Pope John Paul, Desmond Tutu or Bruce Springsteen in as CEO, it would all sound the same,&quot; Mr. Bakes said.    The machinists, for their part, assert that they are bargaining in good faith, and have been forced to take their case to the courts to block clear contract violations.    While lobbying, rallying and speech-making on both sides of the labor struggle reaches a crescendo, it's the political mood in Congress during this election year that has some analysts especially worried.    Roughly 130 House members and five senators have co-sponsored resolutions requesting that the Department of Transportation formally investigate Texas Air, its safety and employment records, as well as the complex business transactions that are a hallmark of Chairman Frank Lorenzo.    &quot;Congress is beginning to look very seriously at Mr. Lorenzo,&quot; said Robert Joedicke of Shearson Lehman Hutton. &quot;It's even more important than these court rulings. They are still to a degree a regulated industry, and if there is an antagonistic attitude in Washington, it makes it difficult.&quot; So far, however, James Burnley, secretary of transportation, has resisted the call for an investigation, saying the Reagan administration doesn't want to get involved in labor-management issues.    But the Federal Aviation Administration says it has stepped up its oversight of Eastern because of the labor dispute, as is their practice. Eastern and Texas Air's Continental unit control one-fifth of the nation's airline seats.    &quot;When you are looking at 20% of the avaiation capacity and the kind of difficulties they are having, inevitably, it will be a large-scale investigation,&quot; said Anthony Broderick, associate administrator for flight standards.    For its part, Eastern has even organized a group called the Positive Employee Action Committee at Eastern -- PEACE, for short -- comprised of employees ostensbily neutral in the acrimonious dispute. Eastern, however, paid for the employees' transportation to Washington, where they lobbied Congressmen to pressure the mediation board to start the 30-day clock in the machinists' talks. </TEXT></DOC>
