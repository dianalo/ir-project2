The commission's marathon meeting yesterday was its first public discussion of the crash. It may prove most significant for demonstrating the deep divisions among the five commissioners, all appointed by President Reagan.    During the sometimes stormy eight-hour meeting, the SEC voted to ask for, among other things, emergency powers to suspend all securities trading and the ability to require reporting of all large securities transactions, such as program trades. The day's most heated debate centered on whether to seek authority over stock-related futures trading, which was approved by a 3-2 vote.    Some of these proposals are viewed as non-starters on Capitol Hill, but others, such as the power to suspend trading, are likely to receive at least a sympathetic hearing.    The SEC also unanimously approved a controversial rule, proposed by the New York Stock Exchange, that will require Big Board members to monitor trading at their firms for violations of securities laws, and also to report annually to the exchange on customer complaints.    The rule was proposed last year in response to Wall Street's insider-trading scandal and drew heavy fire from some brokerage firms and from the Securities Industry Association, a trade group.    The meeting was marked by flashes of hostility between SEC Chairman David Ruder and Commissioner Joseph Grundfest, an outspoken free marketeer who at one point accused the chairman of succumbing to &quot;regulatory imperialism.&quot;    Mr. Grundfest also explicitly criticized Mr. Ruder's performance since the crash, saying the chairman had made a strategic blunder in seeking unilaterally to expand the SEC's powers over futures trading rather than trying to broaden its jurisdiction through cooperation with futures regulators.    The divisions on the SEC over post-crash reforms indicate that it is headed for a stalemate on market regulation issues, especially after Aulana Peters, who often votes with Mr. Ruder, leaves the commission in early July, as she has said she plans.    Of the six legislative proposals considered yesterday, the most disputed is the bid to take over regulation of stock-index futures from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Since the idea was floated in February by Mr. Ruder, it has been blasted by the CFTC, the Chicago futures markets, members of the presidential task force that studied the crash, various lawmakers, and Mr. Grundfest, among others.    Commissioner Edward Fleischman called the move &quot;folly,&quot; while Mr. Grundfest warned that it would provoke a &quot;firestorm&quot; on Capitol Hill.    Ms. Peters, who supported the takeover bid, acknowledged that it would be a &quot;miracle&quot; if it succeeds. Mr. Ruder, meanwhile, noted that he doesn't consider it a priority.    Almost as far-reaching, and far more likely to be enacted into law, are several other new powers the SEC voted to seek, such as the ability to require prompt reporting of large securities transactions.    Richard Ketchum, director of the SEC's market regulation division, said the large-trade proposal, if enacted, would enable his staff to monitor index arbitrage, portfolio trading, and other forms of program trading &quot;on an almost instantaneous basis.&quot;    Currently, the SEC is able to reconstruct such trading only long after it occurs, if at all. The CFTC, by contrast, already has a large-trade reporting system, and in fact proposed a new reporting rule that would enable it to more quickly identify and follow index arbitrage trading.    The SEC staff had prepared a draft proposal specifying the reporting levels for large trades, but that proposal was discarded after the commission decided instead to set such levels when and if Congress gives the SEC the power to do so. The staff proposal would have required reports within 24 hours of all trades with a market value of more than $2 million in an individual stock, and of all trades in groups of stocks, such as portfolio trades, with a value of more than $5 million.    As approved, the large-trade proposal exempts the reports from the Freedom of Information Act. Even so, it is likely to run into considerable trouble over concerns that such reporting requirements could scare away foreign investors.    Another proposed piece of legislation approved would require affiliates of securities firms not regulated by the SEC to tell the agency about financial arrangements or transactions that could affect the part of the firm that is in the securities business.    &quot;What we're looking primarily for . . . is to get a feel in major firms as to what exposures may exist, where chinks in their armor may occur and impact investor confidence in that firm,&quot; Mr. Ketchum explained. As an example, he said, &quot;I want to know if the U.K. affiliate (of a given firm) is going belly-up today and the result is a freezing in the financial markets in lending to the U.S. affiliate.&quot;    The commission also approved two less controversial proposals. One is a rather vague statement calling for integrating the clearance and settlement process for stock, options and futures transactions. The other asks for the authority to temporarily shut down securities trading during emergencies, as determined by the SEC.    Finally, the commission considered but decided to table for revision a proposal that would take away from the futures markets the authority to set margins on stock-related futures and give it to the Federal Reserve Board. </TEXT></DOC>
