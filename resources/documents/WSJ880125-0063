Whitney North Seymour had his own stationery made up using the Justice Department seal, except that he inverted the eagle to face the opposite direction. Lawrence Walsh's deputy told a panel of appeals court judges that independent counsels are &quot;inferior officers&quot; yet answer to no one for anything, including the President. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals quashed these conceits Friday. It announced that Congress violated the Constitution when it gave such counsels the power to prosecute citizens.    Readers of these columns will be familiar with the constitutional oxymoron of &quot;independent prosecutors.&quot; Enforcing the law is solely an executive-branch function; Congress can't create its own prosecutors. Moreover, these counsels have by their actions shown the dangers of establishing a federal officer answerable to no one. Mr. Seymour subpoenaed Canada's ambassador and Mr. Walsh got two Contra fund-raisers to plead guilty to tax charges that the Internal Revenue Service says were not crimes.    The opinion by Judge Laurence Silberman, joined by Stephen Williams, recognizes that independent counsels, appointed under the Ethics in Government Act, have less to do with law enforcement than politics. &quot;Great constitutional cases have often arisen out of the crucible of partisan struggle,&quot; the ruling says. This law was passed during &quot;a period when one political party tended to control the Presidency and the other enjoyed dominance in the legislative branch.&quot;    The case arose from a perfect example of how independent counsels turn policy differences between Congress and the President into criminal cases. The target was Theodore Olson, a former assistant attorney general who withheld Environmental Protection Agency documents from Congress, citing executive privilege. Congress thereupon demanded an independent counsel, and as a result prosecutor Alexia Morrison has hounded Mr. Olson for two years.    If the ruling stands, the consequences will be enormous. When the constitutionality of these counsels came under challenge, Attorney General Meese offered them parallel appointments within the Justice Department. Mr. Seymour refused, so Mike Deaver most likely will have his recent perjury conviction reversed and has a very strong claim to double jeopardy. Ms. Morrison also refused, so Mr. Olson has a double-jeopardy claim; also, the statute of limitations for him is about to expire.    The effect on the Iran-Contra investigation could also be great. Mr. Walsh accepted the parallel appointment from Mr. Meese, but that was after he had operated as an independent counsel for his first four months -- from December 1986 until March 1987. During this period of unconstitutional existence, he subpoenaed witnesses and documents, called a grand jury and drew up charges. Mr. Walsh has refused even to read newspapers, lest he taint his investigation. But it has now been ruled that Mr. Walsh's office at its inception was illegitimate, so incurs the greatest taint -- it is unconstitutional.    It can also be strongly argued that established legal principle should bar Mr. Walsh from using any evidence he gathered before he took the parallel appointment. If this makes his inquiry impossible, such is the price Congress pays for creating unconstitutional prosecutors. If he continues as a Justice Department employee, he will have to abstain from pursuing any more wacky theories, such as what is the proper standard for prosecution, which Judge Silberman discusses in the nearby excerpts. (See related story &quot;The Rights of Individuals Are at Stake&quot; -- WSJ Jan 25, 1988)   This decision gives an important boost to the weakened presidency. Judge Silberman writes that repeated calls for appointing independent counsels &quot;may, like a flicking left jab, confound the executive branch in dealing with Congress.&quot; This was precisely why Congress applied the Ethics in Government Act only to the executive, and is why we've dubbed it the Hypocrisy in Government Act.    Political accountability requires that only the executive branch execute the laws. Congress was &quot;the branch most feared by the Framers,&quot; Judge Silberman recalls, and cites their experience with Star Chamber proceedings for their prohibition against Congress passing bills of attainder. The unitary executive makes law enforcement accountable. &quot;No anonymous directorates hold sway here, no impenetrable bureaucracies or commissions obscure the identity of the responsible official; the chain of command leads directly upward to the President&quot; and the executive has investigated itself from Teapot Dome to Watergate, the ruling says.    Judge Silberman emphasizes that the dry concept of separation of powers can obscure what is truly at stake here. Several public servants -- from Ted Olson to Ollie North -- have had to live with the Kafkaesque nightmare of an uncontrolled prosecutor. In its zeal to undermine the presidency, Congress brazenly violated the Constitution and thereby robbed individuals of the right to equal justice. </TEXT></DOC>
