Reviewsresults of investigations carried out in the Komsomolets mine (Leninskugol'association) into effectiveness of degassing old worked out areas usingextension of gas ducts left in goafs, and via boreholes drilled fromthe surface. Indicates that high efficiency (32-34%) can be achievedusing the system discussed. Diagrams showing degassing of worked outareas and changes in gas emission from coal seams are given.</TEXT></DOC>
