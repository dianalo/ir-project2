(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge has convicted a cocaine-addictedmother of delivering drugs to her two children through theirumbilical cords at birth.   Rejecting arguments that the law under which she was tried wasmeant only for criminals engaged in illegal drug deals, CircuitJudge O.H. Eaton Jr. said he viewed the two children born toJennifer Clarise Johnson as victims.   ``These children had no ability to control what was beingintroduced into their bodies,'' Eaton said in handing down theruling Thursday after a non-jury trial. ``The defendant had thatability.''   The unmarried 23-year-old woman is believed to be the firstmother in Florida _ and one of only a few in the country _ convictedof pushing drugs to their children under a criminal drug-dealingstatute.   Ms. Johnson faces a 30-year sentence, but prosecutor Jeff Deensaid he would recommend that she complete a drug program she isundergoing and then serve ``a lengthy probation period.''   In his ruling, the judge made two key determinations:   _ That the illegal substance traveled from Ms. Johnson's bodyinto the babies at birth, but before their umbilical cords weresevered.   _ And that ``a child who is born but whose umbilical cord has notbeen severed is a person'' within the Florida law under which shewas tried.   The defense had argued that a newborn is not a person until thecord is severed and that Ms. Johnson could not be tried under thelaw that makes it a felony for someone to ``deliver'' drugs to aminor.   ``I am convinced and find that the term `delivery' (in the law)includes the passage of cocaine or a derivative of it from the bodyof a mother into the body of her child through the umbilical cordafter birth occurs,'' the judge held.   Ms. Johnson was acquitted of one count of child abuse. Othermothers giving birth to so-called cocaine babies have beensuccessfully prosecuted under that law, which carries a maximum offive years in prison.   The defendant, who sat impassively during the trial, refusedcomment. Her attorney, Jim Sweeting, said he would appeal.   Sweeting, representatives of the American Civil Liberties Unionand a doctor who testified on the defendant's behalf had argued thata guilty verdict encourage pregnant addicts to avoid prenatal careand give birth to their babies outside hospitals because they wouldfear imprisonment.   ``I think what we found today is that having a baby is a crimefor pregnant addicts,'' Sweeting said.   The judge said he believed the opposite to be true _ thatpregnant addicts are now placed on notice that they have aresponsibility to seek treatment.   The children, a boy born in 1987 and a girl born in January, arebeing cared for by Ms. Johnson's mother and an aunt. Doctors saidthey appear to be healthy.</TEXT></DOC>
