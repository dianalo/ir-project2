We add lanthanumto the plutonium solution as an internal standard, oxidize the plutoniumto Pu{sup {plus}4}, and pass the solution through an anion-exchange columnwith 8M HCl. The Pu{sup {plus}4} sorbs to the resin, and the cerium andlanthanum pass through the column completely. We evaporate the solutioncontaining the cerium and the lanthanum to 0.5 mL for pipetting ontoa resin paper disc. The Pu{sup {plus}4} is eluted off the column using0.1M HCl. We then measure the K{sub {alpha}} x-ray line for both ceriumand lanthanum. The ratio of cerium to lanthanum for the sample is thencompared with those from the standards. This method has a precision of2.8% relative standard deviation for cerium over a concentration rangeof 0.1 to 5% cerium. 2 refs., 2 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
