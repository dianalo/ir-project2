The government's debt has climbed from less than $1 trillion whenReagan took office to more than $2.6 trillion. Most Americans payless income tax than when Reagan took office, but the overallfederal burden _ including Social Security taxes _ rose for thepoorest citizens. Despite his pledge to get government off the backsof the citizens, Reagan made few inroads in his war againstgovernment regulation.   Reagan gave mixed signals on environmental controls, his recordending largely in stalemate. The defense establishment grewenormously. And the Reagan era ended the dream of home ownership formillions. In one important area, Reagan's full impact is yet to befelt _ the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary.   Associated Press reporters who have covered these areas sum upthe Reagan impact:</TEXT><HEAD>The Economy: 75 Months of Growth _ But Deficits Grew, Too</HEAD><TEXT>   When Reagan leaves office, the U.S. economy will be in its 75thmonth of expansion, a peacetime record, with the once-famous``misery index'' far below where it was in Jimmy Carter's last daysin office.   When Reagan was sworn in, the country was in the grips of itsworst economic predicament since the Great Depression, along-simmering bout of inflation fueled by successive oil shocksthat had sent consumer prices rising at double-digit rates.   The misery index _ a number concocted by adding the inflationrate and the unemployment rate _ climbed to a peak of 20.6 at theend of the Carter years. As Reagan leaves office, the index is downbelow 10 percent with the jobless rate at a 14-year low of 5.3percent and inflation hovering slightly above 4 percent, about whereit has been for seven years.   Reagan had a lot of help in the inflation fight from formerFederal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, but he supported Volcker evenin the dark days of 1981-82 when the Fed's credit-tightening movesplunged the country into its worst recession since the 1930s.   After the downturn, the economy embarked on an expansion that haslasted more than four times longer than the typical recovery,creating more than 18 million jobs in the process.   Critics contend that the rich received a disproportionate shareof the Reagan era prosperity.   While the administration points to statistics showing that medianfamily incomes, after adjusting for inflation, climbed to a recordhigh of $30,853, the critics note that the 13.5 percent poverty ratewas higher than the levels recorded in the Carter, Ford and Nixonadministrations.   The most lasting monuments of the Reagan economic policies may bethe twin debt mountains built by a near tripling in the nationaldebt and the country's slide from being the world's largest creditornation to the world's largest debtor nation, a development thatoccurred because of the huge trade deficits.   It is those debt burdens, critics say, that will haunt GeorgeBush and seriously constrain his maneuvering room during hispresidency.</TEXT><NOTE>_By Martin Crutsinger</NOTE><HEAD>Taxes: Down for Average American Family, But Not by Much</HEAD><TEXT>   Most Americans at all economic levels are paying less income taxthan they were when Reagan took office, but the total federal burdenon lower-income families has increased because of rising SocialSecurity taxes.   ``The largest reductions between 1980 and 1988 will be for the 1percent of families with the highest incomes,'' says the nonpartisanCongressional Budget Office in summing up tax changes of the Reaganera.   Two far-reaching tax laws were enacted: the 1981 across-the-boardtax cut for individuals and corporations, and the 1986 overhaul thatslashed rates to the lowest levels in a half-century, eliminating orreducing several deductions and shifting a big part of the taxburden from individuals to business.   In between and since those landmark acts, Congress and Reaganagreed to more than a dozen tax increases _ most of them designedchiefly to reduce the federal deficit _ which took back much of theearlier tax cuts. Social Security taxes also went up.   In estimating effects of all those tax changes, CBO dividedtaxpayers into 10 groups (deciles) according to size of familyincome. The first decil covered the 10 percent of families whoseincomes were lowest; the 10th decile covered the 10 percent with thehighest incomes. Here are some CBO findings:   _The effective individual income tax rate dropped for all 10groups from 1980 to 1988, but social insurance taxes _ mainly SocialSecurity _ rose for all 10. The income tax cut was not enough tooffset the Social Security tax increase for the poorer half offamilies (earning less than $23,540).   _The poorest decile (under $3,685 income) spent 9.6 percent oftheir income on federal taxes in 1988, up from 6.6 percent in 1980.Those in the sixth decile (averaging $29,660) paid 20.9 percent,down from 21.4 percent. The richest 10 percent (averaging $125,800income) paid 25 percent in 1988 and 27.1 percent in 1980.   _American families on average in 1988 paid 22.7 percent of theirincome in federal taxes (including Social Security, excise taxes andall other federal taxes), down from 23.3 percent in 1980. Incometaxes alone averaged 10.4 percent, down from 12.3 percent   _The share of total federal taxes paid by the richest 10 percentof families rose by as much as 1.5 percentage points from 1980 to1988. But their share of pre-tax income increased nearly twice asmuch.</TEXT><NOTE>_Jim Luther</NOTE><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
