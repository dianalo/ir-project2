Hilliet Williams, 28, died Thursday. He had been in theneurosurgical intensive care unit at Jackson Memorial Hospital sincethe beating Jan. 17, the second night of rioting in Miami'spredominantly black neighborhoods following the shooting death of ablack motorcyclist by a Hispanic officer.   Williams, who lived in the troubled Liberty City neighborhood,had seen a white man being attacked by two black men and intervened,giving the white man a chance to escape, said Metro-Dade policespokesman Nick Pimentel.   The two attackers then turned on Williams, beating him andstealing his van, Pimentel said.   ``He was trying to make them stop, so they beat Williams becausethey could not beat the white man,'' he said.   Williams gave some information to police before he died, but notenough to track down the two men, Pimentel said, adding, ``we aretrying to find the white male because we have no other lead at thistime.''   Rioting was sparked when a Hispanic police officer shot andkilled motorcyclist Clement Anthony Lloyd, who had been reportedspeeding in the Overtown section of Miami. Lloyd's passenger, AllanBlanchard, died the next day from injuries suffered in the resultingcrash.   Officer William Lozano heard a radio report of a recklessmotorcyclist headed in his direction, stepped off a curb and shotLloyd. Lozano, who has been charged with two counts of manslaughterin the men's deaths, contends he acted in self-defense.
