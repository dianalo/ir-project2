(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The carcasses of 48 of the endangeredKemp's ridley turtles have washed ashore in south Georgia and northFlorida this fall.   ``This is pretty much a crisis,'' said Charles Maley of theGeorgia Department of Natural Resources. ``This is the most we'veever had in a year.''   Ten Kemp's ridley turtles turned up dead on Georgia beaches inOctober and 11 have been reported so far in November, Maley said.   In Florida, 27 carcasses have been found on Amelia Island, thenorthernmost island on the state's east coast, since Oct. 28,according to Jan Johnson, Florida-based coordinator for the nationalsea turtle campaign of the environmental group Greenpeace.   ``We usually find one or two in fall months,'' Ms. Johnson said.   According to Ms. Johnson, Kemp's ridleys are considered therarest and most endangered of all sea turtles. They are also one ofthe smaller species, with the females' shells averaging about 30inches long, she said. Only 400 to 600 nesting females are believedto exist worldwide.   Ms. Johnson said she believes the Kemp's ridleys, which migratesouth to a nesting beach at Rancho Nuevo, Mexico, fell victim tocommercial shrimp boats. Shrimpers sometimes accidentally catch seaturtles in their nets and drown them.   But Duncan Amos, director of the University of Georgia's MarineExtension Center in Brunswick, said sea turtles also fall prey tocold water, pollution, shark attacks, boat propellers and dredging.</TEXT></DOC>
