The agreement clears up uncertainty over the future of the Dornier group, which plays a major role in a proposal that calls for Daimler-Benz to assume managerial control of Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H., an aerospace and defense technology concern.    The capital injection resolves a dispute that began after members of the Dornier family, who hold a 30.5% Dornier stake, earlier this year wouldn't agree to a 300 million-mark share capital increase with Daimler-Benz. The automotive-technology concern acquired a 65.5% Dornier stake in 1985. The remaining 4% is held by the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.    The Dornier family's blocking minority vote on the Dornier board also prevented Daimler-Benz from pushing through a stock capital increase on its own, which would have shrunk the Dornier family's stake in the company to a fraction of its current size. Instead, Daimler-Benz decided to boost Dornier's capital reserves.    The arrangement secures the funding needed for the development of Dornier's Do-328 aircraft, a 30-seat turboprop whose doubtful future threatened many of Dornier's 9,700 jobs.    In return for Daimler-Benz's capital infusion, the Dornier family agreed to waive its rights in helping to determine the industrial strategy of the Dornier group.    It was crucial for Daimler to gain unqualified control over decision-making at Dornier, because it removes the Dornier family's obstruction of Daimler-Benz's plans to restructure the aerospace and technology concern by separating its aerospace activities from other operations.    Daimler-Benz is considering the step if it decides to integrate the aerospace activities of Dornier and MBB, which is controlled by three state governments. Daimler-Benz is talking with state and federal officials about acquiring a 30% interest and managerial control in MBB, whose Deutsche Airbus subsidiary controls West Germany's 37.9% stake in the four-nation European Airbus Industrie consortium.    But a major stumbling block to plans for Daimler-Benz to manage the aerospace industry is Daimler-Benz's insistence on government guarantees covering future losses in MBB's Airbus activities. </TEXT></DOC>
