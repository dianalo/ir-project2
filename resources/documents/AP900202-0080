(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Punxsutawney Phil, America's premiergroundhog, emerged from his burrow today and indicated in``unmistakable groundhogese'' that he had failed to spot hisshadow, a sure sign spring is just around the corner, according toPhil's followers.   ``He stood proud, tall and confident, surveyed the throng ofloyal followers, peered skyward toward the east and then fixed hiseyes groundward,'' said county judge Edwin Snyder. He is a memberof the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club's exclusive Inner Circle, whicheach year decides in advance whether Phil will ``see'' his shadow.   Snyder said Phil ``turned to Groundhog President Jim Means andsignaled to him in unmistakable groundhogese, `There is no shadowtoday.'''   The squirming, 10-pound woodchuck was pulled from his man-madeburrow atop Gobbler's Knob at sunrise, 7:27 a.m. Means held thegroundhog up to his ear to hear the once-a-year prediction, thenlifted him toward Snyder.   The approximately 1,500 people who had gathered under cloudyskies and in light rain cheered as Phil's forecast was announced.   ``I've always wanted to come to this event ever since I was akid,'' said Peter Teicher, 49, of Los Angeles. ``I'm reallyexcited. I couldn't sleep last night. It's a real thrill.''   Other prognasticating groundhogs around the country followedPhil's lead and also failed to see their shadows.   Legend has it that if the famous groundhog sees his shadow whenhe emerges from his bungalow at sunrise on Feb. 2, there will besix more weeks of winter. If he doesn't, spring is supposedly justaround the corner.   ``You know and I know that Feb. 2 is too darn early to expectspring to come,'' said Tim Clark, executive editor of The OldFarmer's Almanac.   But the two-legged variety of weather forecasters are stillcurious about what Phil has to say on Groundhog Day.   ``I definitely do watch to see what he does. I didn't say Ibelieve it. I say I watch it,'' said Albert Peterlin, a hydrologistfor the National Weather Service in Harrisburg.   ``This has a little bit of history and fact,'' he said.``Animals respond to temperature and environment as it occurs.''   Before today, Phil had predicted an early spring only nine timessince 1887, when German-born farmers initiated the yearly event inthis small western Pennsylvania town.   The farmers borrowed from the legend of Candlemas, a Christianholiday celebrating the first time the infant Jesus was taken tothe temple. An old Scottish couplet claims, ``If Candlemas be fair,there'll be two winters in the year.''   Groundhogs, part of the rodent family, usually hibernate byDecember and stay underground until April or so, but sometimesventure out early if the weather is mild.   ``Phil's never been wrong,'' boasted Means, 66.   The 14 local businessmen who comprise the Inner Circle decidewell in advance what Phil's forecast will be. Group members stagesseveral rehearsals before Groundhog Day, when they don top hats andtails for the event.   Phil's handler, Bud Dunkel, sported a fake fur hat resembling agroundhog.   Every other day of the year, Phil lives at his heated,air-conditioned hutch at the local library with two othergroundhogs, Philomena and Barney.   As far as The Old Farmer's Almanac is concerned, February _ atleast around Punxsutawney _ will be extremely cold and snowyfollowed by similar weather in early March.   The National Weather Service is calling for a warmer than usualFebruary, but a colder than usual March and April.   ``If I were to give you the scientific point of view, I think itwould be cold for the rest of this winter,'' said meteorologistVictor Nouhan. ``Of course, that's worth a grain of salt.''   Groundhog Octorara Orphie also saw no shadow in centralPennsylvania's Quarryville. And neither did West Virginia's ConcordCharlie as he was ``wandering around campus to see if any flowersare up,'' said Tom Bone, public information director for ConcordCollege in Athens.   Ditto for French Creek Freddie at the French Creek WildlifePreserve in Upshur County in West Virginia and General Lee at theYellow River Game Ranch in Lilburn, Ga.   The newest addition to the groundhog lineup, Little Hog, madehis debut at the Indianapolis Zoo with fans joining in a rousingchorus of ``You Are My Sunshine'' on kazoos. But there was nosunshine and no shadow there.</TEXT></DOC>
