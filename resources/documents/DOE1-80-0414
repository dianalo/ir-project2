Sine wave voltage of a single phase a.c. sourcecan be divided every half wave unit, and be distributed by the switchingaction of a thyristor, so that the single phase alternating current isconverted to a polyphase alternating current with the frequency dividedby the phase number. The characteristics of a polyphase induction motorwhen driven in such a way have been revealed by calculation and experiment.The torque characteristics are almost equivalent to those obtained whendriven with an ordinary 3-phase source, with sufficient starting torquegiven. The conversion circuit constitution and action are simple, sincethe circuit essentially contains a thyristor only. The commutation iscarried out through a source voltage. Particular commutation circuitsare unnecessary, and the commutating action is stable. The phase numbercan be easily changed with frequency in correspondence to the phase number.Accordingly, the speed of the motor can be easily changed step by step.(14 figs, 9 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
