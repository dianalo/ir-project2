The decision reflects the administration's desire to meetescalating Saudi demands for high-technology militaryequipment, while stopping short of providing top-of-the-linejet fighters or other offensive weaponry. Just a few weeksago, the State Department officially told lawmakers it didn'texpect to submit any major Arab arms sales for congressionalapproval through this fall and possibly longer. But sincethen, the Saudi government and its allies have stepped uppressure on the White House to propose sales soon.</LP><TEXT>   Just last Tuesday, Defense Department officials andlawmakers were surprised and angered by industry disclosuresthat the Saudis were looking soon to buy as many as 72 F-15jets. Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams quickly dashed hopesfor such a deal, announcing that the administration wouldn'task Congress to approve any sales of combat aircraft to theSaudis for at least &quot;the next several months.&quot;   By the end of last week, Saudi officials and their allieswere telling lawmakers that the initial F-15 request had beenmisunderstood, and that the Patriots remained at the top oftheir armaments wish list. Nevertheless, U.S. officialsexpect they will have to deal with the issue of whether tosell additional F-15s to the Saudis next year.</TEXT></DOC>
