The amendments added requirements for random testing,a prohibition on non-medical use of controlled substances at any time (a``drug-free rule''), and new urine drug testing requirements incorporatingthe Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs (53 FR47002; 49 CFR part 40) (``DOT Procedures'').On May 23, 1989, FRA published a revised timetable for implementation ofthe new regulatory requirements (54 FR 22283). Under part 219 as revised,as of October 2, 1989, pre-employment and reasonable cause testing programs(subparts D and E) were to be subject to the new subpart H of the regulations,incorporating the DOT Procedures. By this date, duplicative and inconsistentprovisions of subparts D and F were to have been modified or repealed througha separate rulemaking process. A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is publishedelsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4> that would make the required amendments to subpartsD and F and a number of additional technical, conforming and perfectingchanges to the alcohol/drug regulations. However, it is evident that thisrulemaking cannot be completed in time to provide adequate notice for railroadsto implement new testing procedures. In addition, the Department is consideringpossible further changes in the DOT Procedures. It is in the interest ofthe railroads and their employees that changes in drug testing proceduresbe implemented in an orderly manner, based on a fully integrated set ofregulatory requirements.Therefore, FRA is postponing the compliance date for application of subpartH of part 219 and the DOT Procedures from October 2, 1989, to January 16,1990. The latter date is the date set for commencement of random drug testingby Class I freight railroads, Amtrak and railroads providing commuter railservice. A conforming amendment is made to andSection; 219.711 with respectto notification of post-accident testing results, since some railroadsmay not have a Medical Review Officer function fully established priorto implementation of subpart H. A correction is also made to andSection;219.601 that deletes the clause ``(except where approval has been grantedunder paragraph (e) of this section)'' in paragraph (b)(1). There is noparagraph (e) in the subject section, and the topic of the cross-referenceis to be addressed in subsequent rulemaking.FRA emphasizes that the agency has made no change in the requirement thatcertain major railroads file random testing programs not later than October2, 1989. The effective date of the new andSection; 219.102 of the regulations,which bars use of controlled substances by covered employes at any timeexcept with medical authorization (andSection; 219.103), will also remainOctober 2, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>FRA finds that notice and opportunity for comment are not necessary becausethe effect of the amendments is to provide additional time for compliance.FRA also finds that providing such notice would be contrary to the publicinterest because regulated entities would be compelled to expend resourcesover the short term to comply with a deadline that clearly must be adjusted.FRA further finds that there is good cause for making the rule effectivein less than 30 days from the date of publication, since the amendmentsmodify current regulatory obligations and do not impose more stringentrequirements.This final rule has been evaluated in accordance with existing regulatorypolicies. It is neither a ``major'' rule under Executive Order 12291 nora ``significant'' rule as defined under DOT policies and procedures. Theamendments contained in this final rule do not have any significant paperwork,Federalism, or economic impact. To the extent that any such impact exists,the amendments will lessen regulatory burdens by increasing the time availableto comply with regulations previously issued. Because the amendments donot have any significant economic impact, FRA has not prepared a regulatoryevaluation. It is certified that this rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the provisionsof the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 60 <T3>et seq.</T3>).Therefore, in consideration of the foregoing, Part 219, title 49, Codeof Federal Regulations is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 219</ITAG>Railroad safety, Control of alcohol and drug use.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 219_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
