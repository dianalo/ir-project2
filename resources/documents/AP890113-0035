Argentina, which invaded the islands it calls the Malvinas in1982 and was driven out 74 days later by the British, stronglyopposes the shipping links. Uruguay has said it will not cooperateunless neighboring Argentina agrees, while Chile says its attitudedepends on Uruguay's.   The 777-ton Indiana I left Stanley harbor without fanfareThursday carrying 12 passengers, believed to be mostly islandbusinessmen hoping to establish mainland trading links.   The vessel is expected to reach the Uruguayan capital ofMontevideo on Sunday, then head to the southern Chilean town ofPunta Arenas at the tip of South America before returning to theremote Falklands.   The French-built ship was recently refitted in Hull, England. Itis a roll-on, roll-off ferry, meaning vehicles can drive aboard.   ``It is not a regular service, which is significant, because wedon't know where demand will come from,'' said Graham Botterill,manager of the ship.   ``We are an international commercial venture and as such can goanywhere in the world we like,'' he told reporters in Stanley.   Botterill said the ship may only sail to Montevideo three times aseason, while the ship's booking agent, Tom Swales, said: ``It isnot a scheduled service, and is different in that respect to, say,running a ferry link between England and France.''   The owners hope to attract business executives interested insaving on freight costs. The present shipping link is with distantBritain, 8,000 miles away.   The identity of the Indiana I's owners is not clear, but they areknown to be a consortium including British, Japanese, French,Taiwanese, South Korean and Spanish fishing companies, each of whichhas invested about $260,000.   The ship has a British crew, is registered in Nassau and fliesthe Bahamian flag.   Argentina claims sovereignty to the south Atlantic archipelago.Britain rules it as a colony and says sovereignty depends on thewishes of the islanders, who overwhelmingly want to stay British.   Attempts to launch Anglo-Argentine negotiations on the islands'future are stalled over Argentina's demand to put the sovereigntyissue on the agenda, and Britain's insistence that sovereignty isnon-negotiable.</TEXT></DOC>
