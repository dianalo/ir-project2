Gibraltar Financial Corp.'s lawsuit, filed in U.S. DistrictCourt, is the latest development in a dispute with federal agenciesover whether the holding company will be able to stay afloat nowthat the thrift is under regulators' control.   Gibraltar Savings, the nation's ninth-largest thrift, withoperations in California, Washington state and Florida, was seizedMarch 31 by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which declared theinstitution unsound.   Gibraltar Financial, a holding company whose stock is publiclytraded and which hasn't any significant assets other than twoGibraltar Savings units in California and Washington state, wasn'tincluded in the seizure of its thrifts.   The suit names as defendants the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. and Gibraltar's own seized subsidiaries.   Bank Board spokesman Karl Hoyle responded that regulators hadample reason to take over Gibraltar, and are required by law topreserve the assets of the savings andamp; loan without regard to the fateof the holding company.   ``Our responsibility is to the insured deposits and to thedepositors and to the FSLIC,'' Hoyle said from Washington, D.C.``Unfortunately, that means, in the case of a stock institution, thestockholders, the debtholders, they're cut out.''   The holding company missed a $1 million interest payment tobondholders June 1, blaming regulators' withholding of the $11million.   Gibraltar Savings of California has 83 branches and the sisterthrift in Bellevue, Wash., has six branches in Washington and 18 inFlorida. Together, they had $8.8 billion in deposits when seized.   Gibraltar Financial lost $100.5 million in 1988 and $146.5million in 1987. In 1986, it had a $43.9 million profit.</TEXT></DOC>
