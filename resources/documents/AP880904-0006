At 2 p.m. Sunday, or 8 p.m. EDT, the hurricane was 385 milessouthwest of Honolulu and 350 miles southwest of Lihue, Kauai,moving to the west at 12 mph with maximum sustained winds of 80 mphand gusts to 100 mph, meteorologist Clarence Lee said.   Uleki's westward movement lessened the threat of damaging windsfor Oahu, where Honolulu is located, Kauai and Niihau, Lee said.   However, a high surf advisory remained in effect for allsouthern coasts that were pounded by large waves from the storm.   Rescuers assisted 19 people Saturday in 5- to 6-foot waves offWaikiki Beach and nearby Ala Moana Beach, according to lifeguardCapt. Jim Howe.   A body was discovered Sunday off Maunalua Bay eight miles eastof Honolulu, but it was not immediately known if the death wasrelated to the storm, police said.   Uleki was expected to continue moving westward, and graduallyweaken to the point where it could be downgraded from hurricanestatus this afternoon, Lee said.   When the storm took an unexpected turn toward the islandsFriday, winds near the center gusted to 150 mph.   Uleki is Hawaiian for Ulysses. The weather service in Hawaiisaid the Central Pacific region has its own list of Hawaiian namesfor storms in the region. Next will be Wila, followed by Aka, Ekekaand Hale.   So few storms originate in the region that the list is used overand over, and does not start the year with a name beginning withthe letter A as in the Atlantic or other regions of the Pacific.</TEXT></DOC>
