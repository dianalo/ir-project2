TheCALLA-like structure found in both systems shows an Mr of 95kDa. AdditionalCALLA-like proteins could be identified in the in vivo experiments withcalculated Mrs of 40kDa in the cells and 85 and 38kDa in the culturemedium. In the cell-free translation system, an additional product ofMr 80kDa could be detected.</TEXT></DOC>
