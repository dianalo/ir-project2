A Warsaw Pact position paper given to reporters sets a goal ofmaking both military alliances ``strictly defensive'' by the year2000 after gradual reductions in troops and weapons.   Oleg A. Grinevski, the Soviet ambassador to the new talks onreducing conventional weapons, outlined the Warsaw Pact proposals atthe start of the negotiations involving the 23 NATO and Warsaw Pactnations.   Separate talks on closer East-West relations also began today inVienna. Those talks involve the 35 nations, including the SovietUnion and United States, that signed the 1975 Helsinki accords onhuman rights.   Grinevski stressed the Warsaw Pact's opposition to a Westernproposal to upgrade 700 Lance nuclear missiles to double their rangeto about 150 miles. The missiles are mostly in West Germany.   Reading a prepared statement, Grinevski declared: ``It should beclearly understood that good will has its limits. We have made quitea few major unilateral steps.''   He referred to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev'sannouncement to pull out about 50,000 men and their weaponry fromEast Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary during the next two yearsand pledges by other Soviet bloc countries to scale down theirarmies and defense budgets.   ``Let no one cherish the hope that our profound internal changeswill be making us more malleable and agreeable to unreasonabledemands or inflated bids,'' Grinevski said.   Judging by the Warsaw Pact presentation and prior NATO proposals,the two alliances differ substantially on how and what reduce, andto what extent.   The 16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization proposes deepcuts in battle tanks, artillery pieces and armored personnelcarriers. It says the seven-member Warsaw Pact has a 2-to-1 edge insuch equipment.   The Warsaw Pact paper proposes three stages of reducing personneland arms up to the year 2000.   From 1991 to 1994, participants would eliminate ``imbalances andasymmetries'' between the alliances and ``would take steps toeliminate the capability to launch a surprise attack or initiate alarge-scale offensive action.'' The amount of arms the alliances areallowed to maintain would be reduced by about 15 percent, accordingto the Warsaw Pact.   From 1994 to 1997, the bloc proposed reductions of armed forcesby 25 percent, or 500,000 men.   In the last stage, the armed forces of the NATO and Warsaw Pactnations should be given ``a strictly defensive character,''according to the paper.   It included combat aircraft among the weapons to be cut. But NATOis unwilling to discuss the inclusion of combat aircraft at thispoint.   NATO has proposed overall limits of 40,000 tanks on both sides,33,000 artillery peices overall and 56,000 troop carriers. It alsoproposed a limit of 12,000 tanks, 10,000 artillery pieces and 16,800armored troop carriers for any one nation.   Weaponry stationed outside one's home country would be limited to32,000 tanks, 1,700 artillery pieces and 6,000 armored troopcarriers in each bloc, according to NATO proposals.   Britain's foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, said this wouldcut Soviet tanks and artillery in Europe by two-thirds and armoredtroop carriers by more than 50 percent.   The United States and most other NATO countries have ruled outnegotiations on nuclear or even dual-capable weapons system, statingthat they are not included in the mandate for the new arms talks.   But Grinevski said, ``The more agreement we shall have on theconventional side, the more (are) necessary steps, measures ornegotiations concerning other types of security _ tactical nuclearweapons, and their modernization, and the naval situation.''   Nuclear weapons ``are not on the agenda, but they exist aroundus. It's impossible to close our eyes to that. I'm just warningabout that, nothing more,'' he said.   The arms control negotiations replace and expand the Mutual andBalanced Force Reduction talks, which ended without agreement after15 years.   The new talks _ called the Negotiations on Conventional ArmedForces in Europe _ come during a time of improved relations betweenthe superpowers and are expected to produce results.</TEXT></DOC>
