<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-82-1107 </DOCNO><TEXT>A hybrid heat pump, consisting of a natural gas furnace with a refrigerationcoil placed in the furnace return air duct, was designed, fabricatedand laboratory tested. The furnace design incorporated a by-pass duct,in parallel with the furnace heat exchanger, and a damper to controlthe volume of air passing over the heat exchanger. An electric pilotigniter and a stack damper were included in the design to protect thefurnace heat exchanger from corrosion. The prototype heat pump was built,and tested under steady state conditions. The correct airflow over therefrigeration coil and furnace heat exchanger was achieved by adjustingthe damper position. The heat pump output capacity was 31,000 Btu/hr.and the C.O.P. was 3.14 at the 47/sup 0/F rating point. The measuredsteady state performance data was corrected to compensate for inefficiencieswhich were introduced by the heat pump cycling. An economic evaluationwas performed using the modified performance data. The analysis showedthat the hybrid heat pump is cost effective, compared with conventionalfurnace/air conditioner combinations, on the basis of life cycle costsin Toronto. The advantage of the hybrid, compared with an all-electricheat pump, is that electrical input is not required during the load peaksof the electrical utilities. 19 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
