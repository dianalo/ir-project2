The study, a survey of 7,284 male health professionalsbegun in the mid-1980s, is the first to link a high-fat dietdirectly to polyp growth. Previous research had found thatconsuming a high-fat, low-fiber diet increased the risk ofdeveloping cancers of the colon and rectum, but the newreport by researchers at Harvard University's School ofPublic Health suggests that such a diet may produce thefertile environment for cancer to arise.</LP><TEXT>   About 110,000 cases of the cancers were reported in 1990,and 53,000 deaths were attributed to them last year, makingthem the second most common cancers and third most deadly.Americans, on average, consume more than 40% of theircalories from foods high in animal fats. In recent years,health officials have urged people to consume only one-thirdor less of their calories from foods high in animal fats.   &quot;Our findings . . . provide support for recommendationsthat people replace red meat with chicken and fish and eatmore vegetables, fruits and grains to decrease the risk ofcolorectal cancer,&quot; the Harvard researchers wrote in theirreport, which appears in the current issue of the Journal ofthe National Cancer Institute.   The researchers, led by Edward Giovannucci and Walter C.Willett, compared the eating habits of 170 men who developedpolyp growths to similar groups of men in the survey who werefree of polyps. The researchers found that the men with thehighest proportion of high-fiber and lowfats were 3.6 timesless likely to develop polyp growths than those men whoregularly ate high-fat, low-fiber foods.   Conversely, &quot;people who regularly ate red meat instead ofchicken and fish had an 80% greater risk of developingpolyps,&quot; Dr. Giovannucci said.   Dr. Giovannucci said the results suggest that while ahigh-fat diet may promote polyp growth, even more compellingwas evidence that a high-fiber diet can prevent such growthsfrom arising in the first place. The cancers cannot occurwithout such polyps first being present.   The findings may be especially valuable because scientistsin the past few years have uncovered evidence indicating thatcells of the colon and rectum can begin growing into a polypand then into a malignancy if one or more of severaldifferent genes somehow become damaged.   In an editorial accompanying the journal report, SidneyWinawer and Moshe Shike of Memorial Sloan-Kettering CancerCenter, New York, said the findings suggest that thehigh-fat, low-fiber foods may somehow damage the genes whichnormally keep growth of cells lining the colon and rectumunder control.   There also is evidence that some people may inheritgrowth-controlling genes already in damaged form, andtherefore are born with a higher risk of developing polypsand cancer. But because scientists aren't yet able to predictwho is at higher risk, the new study will probably strengthencalls for all Americans to consume diets low in animal fatsand rich in fibers.</TEXT></DOC>
