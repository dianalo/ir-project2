Pictures of the Games will be beamed from Seoul to virtuallyevery country on the globe and are expected to be seen by anestimated 80 percent of the world's population, officials of theInternational Telecommunications Satellite Organization said.   ``With just about every country participating in the Games andpicking up the feed, the summer Olympics from Seoul will be themost watched event in world history,'' said Tony Trujillo, aspokesman for Intelsat.   Intelsat is a non-profit international consortium whose globalsatellite network will provide pictures of the Olympics to all 161countries that will be represented at the Games in the next twoweeks and several others not participating.   Trujillo said nine of Intelsat's 15 satellites will be used tocarry the feeds of hundreds of broadcasting companies andorganizations back to their home countries, where the pictures willdistributed through domestic networks.   ``We started about seven years ago planning the internationalcoverage of the Games, shortly after the site for the '88 Games wasannounced,'' said Arnie Meyers, Intelsat's manager of broadcastservices.   And plans likely will be changing throughout the Games asbroadcasters from countries whose athletes are doing better thanexpected request additional feeds on the satellite network, he said.   The last event of such international viewing proportion was the1984 summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles, when Intelsat carriedpictures of the competition on eight satellites to about 150countries, Trujillo said.   Technological advances this year will permit a transmission toJapan carrying the opening and closing ceremonies in highdefinition television, which produces superior picture quality andsound.   Japanese officials plan to use the feed to demonstrate thetechnology, called HDTV, at locations in about 50 cities throughoutJapan. HDTV broadcasts are scheduled to begin in 1990 in thatcountry, beamed via satellite to small receiving dishes in viewers'homes.   All of the pictures from the 19-day competitions that are sentoutside South Korea will use the Intelsat network, including thepictures sent by NBC-TV, which plans to telecast 179{ hours fromSeoul to American viewers.   Most of the pictures NBC sends back to the United States willcome from the network's cameras, but ``a significant portion'' willcome from the Korean Broadcasting System, the host broadcastingcompany which will provide the world feed, said Doug Kelly, an NBCspokesman.   Intelsat's 115 member countries own and operate the globalsatellite system that is used for international video, data andvoice communications and by some countries for domesticcommunications. Some 57 other countries, including the SovietUnion, are non-member users of the network.</TEXT></DOC>
