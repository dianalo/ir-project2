Gromyko, the tough-negotiating formerforeign minister who survived five Kremlin leadership changes andweathered the dramatic turns of East-West relations in ahalf-century of public life, has died at age 79.   Soviet news reports said Gromkyo, who oversaw Soviet foreignpolicy for 28 years, died Sunday.   The cause of death was not announced, but a Foreign Ministryspokesman said Friday that Gromyko had been hospitalized aftersurgery for a vascular problem _ heart or circulatory system _ thatwas not further identified.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced the death to the SupremeSoviet legislature today.   ``The deputies at the session, with a minute of silence, paidhomage to the memory of the outstanding government and partyleader,'' Radio Moscow said.   The official Tass news agency said the grim-faced Gromyko was``one of the major Soviet diplomats and statesmen of the seniorgeneration'' and added that the country ``lost one of its mostprominent leaders.''   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said of Gromyko,``He was part of our history, with all its good sides and all itsbad sides.'' He said Gromyko recently had been criticized foremphasizing Soviet relations with the United States at the expenseof Kremlin ties with other countries.   The television news program ``Vremya'' reported Gromyko's funeralwill be Wednesday. It said he will be buried at NovodevichyCemetery, where former leader Nikita S. Khrushchev, ex-presidentAnastas I. Mikoyan and ex-foreign minister Vyacheslav M. Molotov areinterred.   Gorbachev will not delay a trip to France on Tuesday to attendthe funeral, Gerasimov said.   President Bush said he was sending condolences to Gromyko's son,Anatoly, and U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock praised Gromyko ascourteous and considerate ``even when relations were difficult.''   As a diplomat, ambassador and foreign minister, Gromyko helpedforge the Soviet-American World War II alliance, joined in draftingthe U.N. Charter and sat in on superpower talks that shaped the faceof the modern world.   Gromyko survived several purges and outlasted Soviet leadersJosef Stalin, Khrushchev, Leonid I. Brezhnev, Yuri V. Andropov andKonstantin U. Chernenko. He served as Soviet ambassador to theUnited States, Britain and the United Nations, which he helped found.   Tass once said he took part in ``the most important foreignpolitical developments of our time.''   Abba Eban, Israeli's foreign minister from 1966 to 1974, praisedGromyko as ``no doubt ... the high priest of diplomacy.'' He citedGromyko's statement, before the 1947 U.N. decision on the partitionPalestine, that a possibility was to divide the land into a Jewishand Arab state.   ``This was a pleasant surprise because ... the assumption wasthat the Stalinist regime was anti-Zionist and anti-Jewish inprinciple,'' said Eban.   After Gorbachev rose to power in March 1985 and revamped theleadership, Gromyko was gradually eased into retirement.   He was replaced as foreign minister that summer by Eduard A.Shevardnadze, a newcomer to foreign affairs, and named to the thenlargely ceremonial post of president.   He stepped down from the Communist Party's ruling Politburo Sept.30 and was replaced as president by Gorbachev a day later. In April,Gromyko lost his last post, membership in the policy-making CentralCommittee.   Gromyko ended his career gracefully, unlike many other Sovietofficials who were abruptly stripped of posts and written out ofofficial history books as new Kremlin chiefs came on board.   Archie Brown, a Soviet affairs specialist at Oxford University inBritain, said today that Gromyko will be remembered ``as a fairlyformidable figure and certainly as an operator and as a survivor.''   But, he added in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp.,Gromyko was not ``an especially enlightened Soviet leader.''   Gromyko generally took a backseat to the leaders he served duringthe years that the Soviet Union cemented its grip on Eastern Europeand rose to become a nuclear power.   Indeed, some observers attributed his longevity to his politicalflexibility and his apparent failure to make a bid for personalpower.   Khrushchev once said in his presence, ``If I tell him to sit onan iceberg, he'll stay there and freeze, but he won't move.''   Gromyko instead served as the articulator of Kremlin positions tothe world through his speeches. But perhaps his most important workcame at bargaining tables from Yalta to Geneva, where he helpednegotiate everything from allied war strategy to the SALT nuclearweapons treaties.   Gromyko gained a reputation as ``Mr. Nyet'' for his toughnegotiating style. He was nicknamed ``Grim Grom'' for his stonycountenance.   His craggy face beneath horn-rimmed glasses became instantlyrecognizable to the outside world.   Andrei Andreyevich Gromyko was born July 18, 1909, toByelorussian peasants.   Joining the Communist Party in 1931, he first studied economicsbut switched to a Foreign Ministry whose ranks were depleted byStalin's purges.   At 39, Gromyko was the youngest ambassador in Soviet history. Buthe proved his expertise by helping put together the alliance againstNazi Germany.   His career took him to Tehran, Potsdam and Yalta, where one storysays Winston Churchill threw cigar stubs at him after he repeatedlywhispered into Stalin's ear that he should demand Germany'sunconditional surrender.   Rising through the ranks of the foreign service, Gromyko servedas ambassador to Britain in 1952-53.   Khrushchev appointed Gromyko foreign minister in 1957, and hehelped the Kremlin leaders turn the Soviet Union into America'sequal as a world power.   Two days before the Cuban missile crisis broke out in October1962, Gromyko calmly told President John F. Kennedy there were noSoviet missiles in Cuba.   While he presented his poker face to the world, many of those whoknew Gromyko said his stoic features masked a sharp wit.   Among the anecdotes that became favorites with journalists washis reply when asked if he had enjoyed breakfast one day.   ``Perhaps,'' Gromyko said.   Gromyko and his wife, Lydia Dmitriyevna, had a son, Anatoly, whohas directed the African Institute of the Soviet Academy ofSciences. They also had a daughter, Emilia, and severalgrandchildren.   The private lives of Soviet leaders are shrouded in secrecy, andit was not immediately known which relatives survived.</TEXT></DOC>
