Taft IV in August directed programmanagers to ask contractors to include in contract bids specifications forthe delivery of CALS data.andM;Taft said the degree to which contractors can deliver CALS data will be afactor in new awards, and he also directed program managers to reviewexisting opportunities for using CALS.andM;The CTN sent identical magnetic tapes to vendors asking them to compose adocument based on their interpretation of military standard 38784, whichcovers output specifications.andP;  Each respondent came up with a differentrendering, said AL Howe, CTN's technical publications lead analyst.andM;Howe said the test results prove Mil-Std 38784 is outdated.andP;  &quot;Time has passedit by,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It's time to take a more definitive approach.&quot;andM;Michael McGrath, head of DOD's CALS office, said, &quot;It's a confirmation of theengineering judgment that we need [new] output specifications.andP;  The benefitof the test is that it sheds some light on how tightly the output specs needto be defined to get rid of the ambiguities.&quot;andM;The output standards are based on International Standard (IS) 8879, whichdefines structure and content for technical documentation.andP;  Howe said theproblem is that IS 8879 does not address format.andP;  Using IS 8879 as a basis,officials should develop a new standard that includes formatting, he said.andM;Larry Welsch, manager of the Office Systems Engineering Group in the SoftwareSystems Technology Division of the National Institute of Standards andTechnology, said he was not surprised at the responses, &quot;since there isn't an[updated] output specification yet.&quot;andM;Welsch said new output specifications have been in the works for at least twoyears and a committee is defining the semantics for the new specification.andM;Welsch said the new output specification will be written so the services canspecify which features they want to use on specific technical documents,allowing them to customize documents while still adhering to a set of definedstandards.andM;Estimates on when a draft of the new specifications will be available forcomments range from June to September.andM;McGrath said there are more than 150 military specifications affecting thewriting of technical manuals.andP;  &quot;The last thing we want to do is develop 150different document type definitions [DTDs] and output specs,&quot; he said.andM;McGrath said officials plan to publish an initial output specification and&quot;very carefully pick about 15DTDs and associated output specs&quot; that willcover the major functions.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
