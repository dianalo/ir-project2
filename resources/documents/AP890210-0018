That's right _ over $80 billion in newrevenues, with no increase in taxes. Our job is to allocate thosenew resources wisely.   We can afford to increase spending _ by a modest amount, butenough to invest in key priorities and still cut the deficit byalmost 40 percent in one year. That will allow us to meet thetargets set forth in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law.   But to do that, we must recognize that growth above inflation infederal programs is not preordained, that not all spendinginitiatives were designed to be immortal.   I make this pledge tonight: My team and I are ready to work withthe Congress, to form a special leadership group, to negotiate ingood faith, to work day and night _ if that's what it takes _ tomeet the budget targets, and to produce a budget on time.   We cannot settle for business as usual. Government by continuingresolution _ or government by crisis _ will not do.   I ask the Congress tonight to approve several measures which willmake budgeting more sensible. We could save time and improveefficiency by enacting two-year budgets. Forty-three governors havethe line-item veto. Presidents should have it, too.   At the very least, when a president proposes to rescind federalspending, the Congress should be required to vote on that proposal _instead of killing it by inaction.   And I ask for Congress to honor the public's wishes by passing aconstitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. Such anamendment, once phased in, will discipline both Congress and theexecutive branch.   Several principles describe the kind of America I hope to buildwith your help in the years ahead.   We will not have the luxury of taking the easy, spendthriftapproach to solving problems _ because higher spending and highertaxes put economic growth at risk.   Economic growth provides jobs and hope. Economic growth enablesus to pay for social programs. Economic growth enhances the securityof the nation. And low tax rates create economic growth.   I believe in giving Americans greater freedom and greater choice_ and I will work for choice for American families, whether in thehousing in which they live, the schools to which they send theirchildren, or the child care they select for their young.   You see, I believe that we have an obligation to those in need,but that government should not be the provider for first resort forthings that the private sector can produce better.   I believe in a society that is free from discrimination andbigotry of any kind. I will work to knock down the barriers left bypast discrimination, and to build a more tolerant society that willstop such barriers from ever being built again.   I believe that family and faith represent the moral compass ofthe nation _ and I will work to make them strong, for as BenjaminFranklin said: ``If a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without Hisnotice, (can) a (great nation) rise without His aid?''   And I believe in giving people the power to make their own livesbetter through growth and opportunity. Together, let's put power inthe hands of people.</TEXT><HEAD>MORE</HEAD></DOC>
