Diagnostic images can be obtained of the carotidarteries, aortic arch, and abdominal aorta. In the field of cardiology,excellent images of the right and left ventricles can be obtained atrest or after exercise following intravenous injections. All these intravenousstudies have the advantage of avoiding the risks inherent to arterialpunctures and can be performed on outpatients in a dedicated digitalangiography suite. The authors installed a DSA unit (Phillips DVI-2CV)in one of the cardiac angiography rooms at the Cleveland Clinic. Thisallows them to evaluate the role of DSA in a busy diagnostic cardiaccatheterization laboratory. In this short period of time the authorsfound that in this setting, DSA opens a wide range of practical applicationsthat in the future may well change their approach in studying the patientwith vascular disease. There are two general areas where DSA has beenclearly valuable as an adjunct to conventional angiography. One has beenin the evaluation of the patient with cardiac disease, and the secondin the patient with associated vascular disease.</TEXT></DOC>
