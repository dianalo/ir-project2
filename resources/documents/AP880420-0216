The hijackers, who murdered two hostages at an earlier stop inLarnaca, Cyprus, were the first to debark at Algiers and theyslipped away into the night.   Kuwait's official news agency KUNA, citing unidentified Algeriansources, said there were nine hijackers.   The purser on the Kuwait Airways plane, Egyptian Abdel MonemMahmoud, said after his release Wednesday that the gunmen had theeyes ``of a shark.''   The air pirates agreed to let the hostages go after arrangingsafe passage with Algerian authorities, who served as mediatorsbetween hijackers and Kuwaiti officials. The gunmen had demandedthat Kuwait release 17 extremists imprisoned for the 1983 bombingsof the U.S. and French embassies there.   The first of the former captives to descend the gangway wereAnware Al-Sabah and Ibtesam Al-Sabah, second cousins to the emir ofKuwait and the only two women left aboard the plane.   Wearing thick black veils, the women were taken to an Algiersclinic with their brother, Fadel Khaled Al-Sabah, who was sufferingfrom a nervous disorder, a doctor said. Algerian authorities saidthe three were not hurt.   Floodlights that had bathed the blue-and-white jet nightly sinceit landed in the North African capital a week ago were turned offat 9 p.m. Tuesday and never came back on.   Most of the freed hostages emerged from their ordeal appearinguncertain that their nightmare was really over.   Few of them saw the hijackers' faces because the gunmen worepillowcases over their heads, with holes cut out for the eyes.   The purser, Mahmoud, said ``The worst moment was when they put agun to the head of one of the passengers ... Their eyes behindtheir masks were sharp and expressionless, like those of a shark.''   A second hostage, 33-year-old meteorologist Khaled Mubarak, saidhe glimpsed five of the hijackers through a crack in the toiletdoor. From this glimpse and from their voices, he said he might beable to recognize some of gunmen in the future.   ``All except the leader. I never saw his face and he never spoketo us,'' he said.   The hostages said none of them was aware that the hijackerskilled two Kuwaiti security men aboard the plane in Cyprus lastweek. The hijackers probably used silencers on the guns.   Ali Kandari, 24, looking astonished, said, ``I had no idea theykilled anyone. Who was it? Where? When?''   No hostage reported being tortured or beaten, but Kandari saidhe saw one hijacker savagely hitting an old man who insisted ongoing to the toilet after being told to sit down.   The man, a diabetic, was released last Thursday and hospitalized.   Hostages said they remained handcuffed at all times.   On Tuesday night, hours before their release, the hijackersdistributed the traditional evening meal served during the Moslemholy month of Ramadan, they said, then directed the captives to goto sleep without allowing them the usual time for prayer.   Tadar El Khebi, a 31-year-old businessman, said he knew theywere about to be released when he saw the hijackers going throughthe plane shortly after 4 a.m. Wednesday wiping it clean offingerprints. Two hours later, the hostages walked off the plane tofreedom.   Many hostages were in constant fear for their lives.   Mahmoud said, ``From the very begining I thought of death. Ithought I would be the first to be killed because they were verysecurity conscious, and they immediately asked me where I had mygun.   ``My mind kept flashing back to my past. At such moments, youthink about things that you never imagined you would remember.''   Mahmoud said he was in a Kuwait Airways Boeing 727 when it washijacked in 1984, with two American passengers killed.   ``I'm happy I'm still OK,'' he said.   Subhi Youssef, 53, the gray-bearded Iraqi captain of the plane,sat quietly in the airport VIP lounge amid the reporters.   When a reporter asked what he would do after returning toKuwait, Youssef, a pilot for 32 years, smiled slightly and replied,``I will sit and think about it.''   Reporters asked Youssef how he felt when the hijackers put a gunto his head in the cockpit when they seized the plane on April 5 ona flight from Bangkok, Thailand, to Kuwait.   ``What can you do?'' Youssef replied, shrugging.   His face showed the fatigue shared by all the hostages.   Another hostage, a 26-year-old lieutenant in the Kuwaiti fireservice who gave his name only as Ali, said he never lostconfidence a solution would be found and that he fully supportedKuwait's refusal to meet the hijackers' main demand.   ``We agree with our government's attitude,'' he said. ``But weknew they would help us. Our government never forgets any Kuwaitcitizen.''   The plane was carrying 112 people at the time of the hijack, buthostages were released at stops at Mashhad, Iran, and at Larnaca.</TEXT></DOC>
