Constantine S. Nicandros, president of the Du Pont Corp. subsidiary, said that because of the project's relatively low cost, estimated at $400 million, it would be profitable even at oil prices of between $17 and $20 a barrel. Conoco forecasts have put prices in that range for the rest of the decade.    The new technology represents a considerable savings over conventional offshore production technology.    The foundation of the project, a &quot;tension-leg well platform,&quot; will be a floating structure that is anchored to the seabed by steel mooring lines, a design that requires far less steel than conventional platforms do.    Conventional platforms are mounted on fabricated steel and concrete structures that are imbedded in the sea floor. The cost of the conventional technology rises sharply with an increase in the depth of the water.    Conoco said the new system, known as the TLWP, will be used to produce oil and gas at 1,760 feet in the Jolliet field in Green Canyon Block 184, about 170 miles southwest of New Orleans. Conventional production platforms are being used in the area in depths to 750 feet.    Though current technology allows oil companies to work in much deeper waters, no oil has been produced from those depths. There currently is production at 1,300 feet off the coast of Brazil. In the Gulf of Mexico, the deepest production -- at 1,025 feet -- is by Shell Oil Co.'s Cognac platform, which is about 100 miles southeast of New Orleans.    Shell also is constructing a platform -- the Bullwinkle -- that will be capable of producing at 1,350 feet. The Bullwinkle platform is to be installed 150 miles southwest of New Orleans.    At the moment, only one oil-production platform employs tension-leg technology. Also installed by Conoco, the system is in the North Sea's Hutton field in 485 feet of water.    Conoco officials said the company's experience in the North Sea enabled it to plan a more efficient and less expensive unit for the Gulf, even though it will be used in much deeper water.    The Gulf platform's construction will require only 12,000 tons of steel, compared with the estimated 80,000 tons needed for a conventional, rigid platform in 1,760 feet of water.    Unlike the North Sea platform, which contains all drilling and production equipment, the Gulf unit will hold only the wellheads for 16 producing wells, and some other production facilities. Remaining production facilities will be on a fixed platform in much shallower water about 10 miles north of the platform.    Development drilling and construction of the platform will occur simultaneously, Mr. Nicandros said. That procedure, he said, means production can begin two to three years sooner than would be possible with the conventional method of building a platform and then drilling the wells.    Mr. Nicandros called the planned system &quot;Conoco's largest-ever domestic offshore project.&quot; He added, &quot;We are confident that the TLWP will reduce costs and lead times of offshore development of oil and gas.&quot;    Company officials predicted that they eventually would be able to produce from depths of 4,000 feet or more with the tension-leg technology.    Conoco estimated reserves in the Block 184 field at about 40 million barrels of oil and 75 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Production is expected to begin in late 1989, with production capacity reaching 35,000 barrels of oil and 50 million cubic feet of natural gas a day.    Operator of the project, Conoco holds an equal share of Green Canyon Block 184 with Texaco Inc. and with the Cities Service subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
