De Klerk, designated the next president of South Africa,indicated that international pressure and economic sanctions on hiscountry may ease ``as long as it is visible that we're reallyworking towards a negotiation situation.''   At the airport news conference, de Klerk did not say how heplanned to engage leaders of the disenfranchised black majority innegotiations to end the apartheid system of race discrimination.   He said he gave ``no concrete agenda'' to leaders he met inBritain, West Germany, Portugal, Italy, Switzerland and the Vatican.   ``Neither I, nor those whom I had discussions with, attempted tomake unrealistic demands or create unrealistic expectations,'' deKlerk said.   His overall impression from the tour ``is that there isrealization that what happens here must be step-by-step and thatthere is realization that to really have successful renewal andchange in South Africa which will not affect the stability of thiscountry the first step is to broaden and intensify the base ofdiscussions as a phase even before what one could call a realnegotiation phase.''   Opponents say Pretoria uses minor reforms to shield itselfagainst criticism and delay the advent of black rule in South Africa.   At nearly every stop on his European tour, de Klerk was askedabout the release of Nelson Mandela, leader of the outlawed AfricanNational Congress, who has been imprisoned since 1962 under a lifesentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government.   Asked about Mandela on Tuesday, de Klerk referred to the Sept. 6parliamentary elections, after which he is expected to succeedPresident P.W. Botha.   ``I want to win the election for my party and I wouldn't like tomake particular statements as to what I, in whatever position onemight be, will particularly do afterward,'' de Klerk said,indicating Mandela's release would lose him votes among right-wingwhites.   Botha suffered a stroke this year and has said he will retireafter the elections.   Also on Tuesday, West German Labor Minister Norbert Bluem said hehad a tough encounter with Botha, with the president refusing todiscuss condemned prisoners or allow him to visit Mandela.   Instead, Bluem said, Botha briefed him on economic progress inSouth Africa.   Bluem said he replied that human rights are not determined by``improved living standards alone. A man does not live on breadalone.'' Bluem said Botha answered that ``he (Botha) will decidewhich position is the right one.''   When Bluem asked to see Mandela, Botha referred him to theminister of justice, who was not on the West German's itinerary.</TEXT></DOC>
