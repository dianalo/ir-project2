The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkU.S. crude, fell 30 cents a barrel to $15.40 a barrel in theopening minutes of trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   That contract had jumped 84 cents a barrel on Monday _ thebiggest daily rise since April _ after Iran said it would accept aUnited Nations resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire inits nearly 8-year-old war with Iraq.   Analysts said an end to the Iran-Iraq war might make it easierfor the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reachagreement on limiting production in order to boost prices.   But analysts also expressed skepticism about the ability of OPECnations and non-OPEC members to end their chronic infighting andoverproduction, even if the Persian Gulf war halts.   ``This is a very, very hype-sensitive market,'' said MadisonGalbraith, senior energy specialist for Merrill Lynch EnergyFutures.   ``Very little has changed here aside from the psychology,'' saidPeter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at EldersFutures Inc.   Monday's jump in the August contract was the biggest rise sinceWest Texas Intermediate soared $1.01 a barrel on April 11.   The price jump was even bigger for the September contract, whichrose 92 cents to $15.89 a barrel.   Monday's jump brought prices back to their levels of earlierthis month, before a steep skid in prices took hold because ofconcerns about a worldwide oversupply of oil. Oil still remainsmore than $1 a barrel below its level of mid-June.   Among refined products traded on the New York MercantileExchange, August No.2 heating oil jumped 2.15 cents a gallon to43.27 cents a gallon. The August contract for unleaded gasolinerose 1.38 cents a gallon to 51.11 cents a gallon.   The rebound in West Texas Intermediate brought it back from itsrecent low of $14.44 a barrel last Wednesday and nearly back to itslevel of $15.83 a barrel on July 7.   Analysts said crude futures were boosted by traders who had beenbetting on further declines in prices and rushed to cover theirpositions by buying contracts.   Aiding the rebound in prices was a report that OPEC's pricemonitoring committee would meet within the next 30 days.   Part of OPEC's overproduction has been ``war relief'' productionby Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, which havegiven the proceeds to Iraq to help in the battle with Iran, saidFrank P. Knuettel, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   A cease-fire could eliminate that source of production, he said.   In addition, Saudi Arabia might be more willing to supportprices instead of punishing Iran by allowing prices to fall, saidRosario Ilacqua, an analyst for Nikko Securities International Co.Inc.   But analysts remained uncertain about the outlook for harmony inthe fractious cartel. Furthermore, there was skepticism over thepossibility that any cease-fire would last.   As part of its announcement, Iran said it would not withdraw itstroops from its borders and called on Iranians to prepare to thwartfurther Iraqi attacks. Iraq, which has already accepted theyear-old U.N. resolution, said it remained skeptical about Iran'sintentions.</TEXT></DOC>
