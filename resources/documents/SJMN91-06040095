Hamilton, who laid her head on her lawyer'sshoulder and sobbed as the verdict was read in Santa Clara County SuperiorCourt, faces life in prison without the possibility of parole.;    Among the412 items of evidence introduced during the trial, the plastic Dr Pepperbottle was the most convincing, jury foreman Robert Galaviz said. It showedthat on Sept. 17, 1987, Hamilton intended to kill Don Wallace, the man shedisparagingly called &quot;the Crying Cowboy,&quot; and cover up her crime.;    Hamiltonhad testified that she feared Wallace, 49, and was trying to leave him. Shegave him a dose of heroin, shot him and took his guns so he wouldn't followher when she left. She said she made the silencer so she wouldn't wake theneighbors.;    But the jury found Hamilton's testimony inconsistent, Galavizsaid. She was detailed on some accounts, vague on others. &quot;I think she was herbest witness and her worst witness.&quot;;    Testimony about abuse; Jurorsconsidered, then discounted psychiatric testimony that presented Hamilton as abattered woman made irrational by fear and a lifetime of abuse by men.According to testimony, Hamilton was abused by her father as a child,gang-raped at age 13 and the victim of several relationships with abusivemen.;    &quot;Did you buy the psych stuff?&quot; Deputy District Attorney John Schonasked the jurors as they gathered around him outside the courtroom. &quot;No,&quot; wasthe unanimous conclusion. The expert testimony couldn't overcome the popbottle silencer.;    Instead, jurors said they believed Schon's theory -- thatHamilton used Wallace for his money, and then killed him as part of a plot tobreak her jailed husband, Alex, out of a Santa Clara County courtroom.;    Onday of shooting;  According to testimony, Hamilton made the silencer and shotWallace with his snub-nose .38-caliber revolver as he lay naked in bed. Thenshe drove away in his yellow Cadillac with packed suitcases, the guns andammunition, the love letters, four cooked steaks, and bags of theatricalmakeup, false beards and wigs.;    Three hours later, Alexander Hamilton, asometime carnival worker and convicted armed robber, was scheduled to appearin court. But Marilyn never got there for the foiled breakout. She was stoppedby police.;    Escorted by an officer, Hamilton returned to the San Joseduplex she shared with Wallace. Police found his body in a pool of blood onthe kitchen floor. The phone was off the hook and there were shards of plasticon his chest. Officers followed a trail of blood to the bedroom, where theyfound the Dr Pepper bottle, its bottom blown out, and other plastic shards.;   Defense attorney Barbara Fargo said she will appeal. Hamilton's sentencing isset for March 8.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ANN W.
