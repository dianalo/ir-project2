 We get our marching orders andwithin a bat of the eye, we're coding.andP;  But if we took the time to chart outwhat we want our programs to do, we'd spend less time in post-mortems.andP;  Andmaybe we'd be picking fewer bugs out of our systems.andM;That's where interactive EasyFlow comes to the rescue.andP;  This clever productfrom HavenTree Software Ltd. assists you be creating standard diagrams of theprogram's logic.andP;  But it more than replaces the plastic IBM flowchartingtemplate issued to computer science nerds in ivy halls around the world.andO;Academia uses flowcharting to instill structured programming into the mindsof students.andP;  Business-oriented programmers can also benefit from thistechnique.andM;The following picture shows the six core flowcharting shapes that describethe logic of program flow.andP;  These are probably the most important elementsyou work with in EasyFlow.andM;You can use these basic flowcharting shapes to describe the logic of even themost complex program.andM;But before you write a line of code, you might want to map out what yoursystem is designed to do.andP;  Data flow diagrams, a mainstay of mainframe dateprocessing, are used to present the logical aspects of information systems.andO;For a clinic, the diagram might depict a process as &quot;interview patient&quot; andthen show a double-headed arrow headed to and from a disk.andP;  This wouldrepresent healthcare personnel referring to the patient's record.andP;  The nextprocess shape could be called &quot;Prescribe medication&quot; and an arrow connects&quot;Interview and Prescribe.&quot;andP;  Another double-headed arrow would indicate that adrug inventory file has been consulted.andM;In addition, there are shapes representing the physical aspects of systemdesign (depicting peripherals such as punch cards, tape reels, CRT, etc.).andO;These come into play once you have a firm grasp on what hardware will benecessary.andP;  (You could then design a more advanced system chart.)andM;Creating and placing shapesandM;Laying down shapes is the primary activity in EasyFlow.andP;  You pick from a listof 65 (see Fig.andP;  3).andP;  A tap of the Enter key delivers the selected shape tothe cursor position on the work screen.andP;  When you run the cursor key throughthe list, you're given a look at the selected shape on the left side of thescreen.andP;  As you become more conversant, you can simultaneously type in a codefor the shape and the associated text to be included in the shape.andP;  If youwant to create a process shape describing a sort, you simply type &quot;P SortNames&quot; (the code for the process shape followed by the text).andP;  Therectangular process shape will appear at the selected spot on the work screenwith the text correctly centered.andM;Block operationsandM;Once you've laid down the menagerie of shapes for your system, you canmanipulate them.andP;  EasyFlow is rich with block operations, and anyone who'sever worked with a text editor will feel right at home.andP;  You can copy andmove within an existing chart.andP;  Any connecting lines you've predefined arererouted once you move a block.andP;  If you want to share blocks among chartfiles, just read or write those blocks to the disk.andP;  The block markingprocess is initiated by pressing F2, infecting the screen with what HavenTreecalls &quot;measles.&quot;andP;  The user is presented with a &quot;rash-like&quot; patch overlayingthe selected area.andM;Not content with tame stuff, EasyFlow also offers a feature called&quot;rotation.&quot;andP;  This enables chart makers to mark a block of shapes andre-orient them horizontally or vertically, depositing the new shapes&quot;righ-side-up&quot;.andP;  The manual earsn high grades for its lucid explanation ofthe process.andM;InstallationandM;EasyFlow is not distributed with a fancy installation program, but don'tfret.andP;  The operation entails creating your own directory and using the DOSCOPY command.andP;  It's simple and works just fine.andM;KeyboardandM;EasyFlow uses pulldown menus.andP;  Unfortunately, menu selections and theiroptions aren't displayed with their keyboard shortcuts.andP;  Nor can you accesspulldown menu options by a key character.andP;  I found myself wishing I couldresort to Alt-F for the FILE menu and S for save.andP;  Using the menus without amouse (discussed later) results in frequent trips to the cursor pad.andP;  But twofeatures improve the picture: the most frequently used operations areassigned to function keys, and a handy reference card contains the keyassignments.andM;Unfortunately, the good, context-sensitive, on-line help system doesn'tdisplay function key settings on command.andP;  (You're referred to the referencecard.)andM;The chart editing screen is where you'll spend most of your time.andP;  This areahas just the right feel, with a grid of up to 16 by 16 shapes per chart fileand 24 per screen page when zoomed out (four across and six down).andP;  You cannavigate with just the cursor keys.andP;  But there were times when I wished thatthe PgUp and PgDn keys would have activated quick jumps across larger charts(which is particularly useful for sweeping block moves and copies).andM;Entry/exit pointsandM;Not everything is smooth though.andP;  Occasionally your systems include pointswhere a step would result in a flow in several directions.andP;  These aremultiple exit points.andP;  Typically these are branches -- the product of a menuchoice.andP;  EasyFlow doesn't permit multiple exit points from a single shape(although shapes can accept multiple entry points).andP;  This minor deficiencywon't pose problems in creating routine charts and the manual does suggest aworkaround.andP;  By manually drawing the extra line segments, you can create asmany connections as you need.andM;There's a tradeoff if you do that though; you forfeit automatic linererouting for those manual additions.andP;  Should you want to move a shapetouched by those manually drawn lines, you'll have to undo your handiwork andthen redraw to the new positions.andM;SpecificationsandM;You'll need only 384K of RAM and a graphics card (Hercules, CGA, EGA or VGA).andO;A mouse is optional (the program is rather easy to use without it) and theaddition of a pointing device makes EasyFlow a delight to work with.andP;  Withjudicious clicking and dragging, you can get to every menu option and invokethe charting functions.andP;  And, bless their hearts, the creators of EasyFlowlet you alter the mouse tracking speed, to provide relaxed or lively mouseresponse.andM;Printers and other outputandM;The program is equipped for most popular printers: Epson nine-pins, H-PLaserJets of all kinds, H-P Plotters, the IBM Graphics Printer and clones,IBM Proprinter, Okidata 19x/29x, Panasonic KX-10xx, Star Gemini, and Epson,Toshiba and NEC 24 Pin machines.andM;There's also a user configurable generic printer driver.andP;  And if you want toincorporate your output in other documents, EasyFlow exports AutoCad DXF andbit-mapped TIF (tagged image format) files.andP;  Output can be configured forportrait or landscape orientation and characters can be compressed toconserve space.andM;Alas, Postscript support is lacking.andP;  There are provisions to install severalprinters along with user-supplied descriptions.andP;  This enables you toconfigure the same printer several different ways.andM;I printed charts on an Epson LQ800 and H-P LaserJet Series II with standard512K.andP;  The Epson produced uneven output with the LQ driver, but a switch toEasyFlow's nine-pin driver yielded very pleasing results.andP;  The H-P outputalso required an adjustment or two.andP;  This turned out to be my oversight.andO;While the standard Hewlett Packard laser printer driver generates 100 dpioutput, the driver for the LaserJet Plus and Series II assumes you'vedownloaded HavenTree's custom fonts.andP;  A menu option invokes the download,which needs to be performed once a session.andP;  Once I discovered my oversight, I was off and running.andM;If your systems are large, you'll appreciate EasyFlow's queued printing.andO;This works well -- I only wish it included more status information.andP;  Forstarters, it could indicate which file is currently printing, what time itstarted, the percentage released to the printer and the estimated print time.andO;These niceties would be fine additions.andP;  Having used (and admired) Clear, adBASE program diagrammer (reviewed in the August 1988 issue and discussedshortly in this article), I anticipated long waits for output.andP;  Both printersspit out the EasyFlow charts in reasonable time.andM;Batch printingandM;Once you begin relying on graphic support for design, you'll undoubtedlygenerate scads of charts.andP;  EasyFlow includes a batch printing option to makethe burden lighter.andP;  However, be prepared to take a long break if you queue atall stack of chart files for printing -- it's not a background operation.andO;You may want to print the charts to disk instead.andP;  Then feed the files one byone to the DOS PRINT program.andM;Printing ought to include background print spooling, while batch output needsmore generous status messages.andP;  When printing several charts I'd likeon-screen confirmation of the file currently printing, its position in thequeue, the percentage of the current file output, and estimates of remainingtime, since batch printing can't be easily stopped.andM;If your charts are large, EasyFlow will automatically form page breaks, using&quot;tiling,&quot; a wallpaper-like means of splitting the patterns between shapes.andO;To use this, you must tell EasyFlow's printer configuration two things -- thenumber of lines to be printed on each page and that you wish to have breaksbetween shapes.andP;  Otherwise the program assumes you want continuous printing-- this might result in broken shapes at the edges of laser printed pages.andO;If you're the inquisitive type, you can preview the page breaks while viewingthe work screen.andP;  Press Alt-B and they become visible.andM;But how does it compare toandM;the competition?andM;Having used Clear for several months, I was particularly interested in thedistinctions between the two products.andP;  EasyFlow doesn't concern itself withyour development environment; you can use it with COBOL, SNOBOL or dBASE (orany other language you can name).andP;  It generic orientation makes it highlyflexible for mapping out programs.andP;  In its current incarnation, Clear isdesigned for the family of dBASE languages.andP;  If you're a dBASE programmer,you may find Clear friendlier -- but it'll require more groundwork thanEasyFlow.andP;  Clear must be fed code before it can generate charts (and it doesa miraculous job of it).andP;  In the precoding phase, Clear users have to createfiles of pseudocode (or skeletons).andP;  These files must include legitimatedBASE control structures so that Clear can map out the program logic.andP;  AClear prototype model would look something like this: USE anyfile IF fileisokDO consolidation program ELSE QUIT and give error ENDIF DO WHILE menuing DOmenu routine DO CASE CASE editchosen DO editroutine CASE addchosen APPENDOTHERWISE DO whineandmoan ENDCASE FOR index = 1 TO maxvalue DO valueIO NEXTENDDOandM;Clear really shines when it's asked to make sense of completed programs.andP;  Andif you relish pseudocoding, then Clear will do.andP;  EasyFlow is a complementarytool, which really excels during the design phase.andP;  You'll probably findyourself charting general system designs rather than documenting code logic.andO;Clear works best at the detail level.andP;  If you're a dBASE programmer, you'llprobably want both products.andP;  They occupy the favored shelf space space in myoffice.andP;  For those of you working with other languages, take heart, EasyFlowwill work wonders for you today.andM;Ease of useandM;&quot;Easy&quot; is a fair description of the product.andP;  The authors could rest on theirlaurels, but if their current version is any evidence, they'll strive tooutdo their last effort.andM;DocumentationandM;The manual is a delight to read.andP;  It's not only informative but breezy andeven humorous at time.andP;  The tone is just right for application developers.andM;SummaryandM;I enjoy working with EasyFlow.andP;  It's a paragon of good user interface andintuitive design -- full featured without being overwhelming.andP;  The pulldownmenus could be fleshed out to increase the ease of use.andP;  And the help systemlacks a comprehensive list of key assignments.andP;  In spite of those problems,though, EasyFlow helps me think out design objectives.andP;  If I get a littlemore ambitious, it'll improve any documentation, boosting my credibility (andperhaps my fees).andP;  I call that ample return for my investment.andM;SourceandM;EasyFlow sells for $149.95 from HavenTree Software Ltd., P.O.
