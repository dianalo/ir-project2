(New York) -- Standardandamp; Poor's Corp. said it affirmed its ratings on $11.1 billionof debt issued by this telecommunications concern and two ofits units. The rating concern affirmed its double-A rating onATandamp;T's senior unsecured debt, which accounted for most of the$11.1 billion, and single-A-1-plus on commercial paper; andsingle-A-1-plus on commercial paper issued by ATandamp;T CapitalCorp. and ATandamp;T Credit Corp. Sandamp;P's move came almost a monthafter Moody's Investors Service Inc. upgraded its rating on$9.2 billion of ATandamp;T's senior debt to double-A-3 fromsingle-A-1. Even after the upgrade, Moody's rating on ATandamp;T'ssenior debt remains slightly lower than Sandamp;P's, which has heldsteady at double-A since it was downgraded because of the1984 breakup of the Bell System; before the breakup, Sandamp;Prated ATandamp;T triple-A. In its affirmation, which came after anannual review, Sandamp;P said financial support for ATandamp;T's creditis expected to strengthen in the near term to mid-term, asearnings and cash flow improve. But it also noted thatleverage has increased in the past two years, and thatfurther investments in the financial sector may weaken ATandamp;T'sbalance sheet in the near term.   ---</LP><TEXT>   GRUMMAN Corp. -- Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. lowered itsratings on about $510 million of this Bethpage, N.Y.,concern's senior debt and preferred stock. The ratings firmreduced its rating on senior debt to triple-B-minus fromtriple-B and on subordinated debt and preferred stock todouble-B-plus from triple-B-minus. Sandamp;P said the downgradesreflect &quot;Grumman's weakening competitive position andcontinued fairly aggressive debt usage within the context ofdeteriorating overall defense industry demand prospects.&quot;Grumman, principally a manufacturer of military aircraft,declined to comment. Sandamp;P said there is &quot;increasing pressureon Grumman to secure new defense-electronics andaircraft-remanufacturing business to bolster futureperformance. This will become increasingly difficult in aperiod of declining military procurement.&quot;   ---   STORAGE TECHNOLOGY Corp. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc.said it raised the rating on the Louisville, Colo., company's13.5% senior debentures to Ba2 from Ba3, affecting about $243million in debt. The rating concern said it believes themaker of data-storage devices will report improved resultsfrom sales of its automated cartridge library systems, whichallow dozens of tape cartridges to be accessed quickly.   ---   UNISYS Corp. -- Standard andamp; Poors Corp. said it affirmedits ratings on approximately $4.9 billion of this company'sdebt and preferred stock, including its triple-B rating onsenior debt. Sandamp;P said the Blue Bell, Pa., computer maker hasexperienced an erosion of its balance sheet, but that recentrestructurings should return the company to profitability inthe near term.
