As previously reported, the company was prompted to propose the change by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman's hostile bid to take over Media General Inc., a Richmond, Va.-based media concern.    The company said the amendment reaffirms the charter's original intent: to permanently empower the Graham family, which owns the company's 2.1 million shares outstanding of Class A stock, with a veto over any takeover proposal. There are 10.8 million Class B shares, which are traded on the American Stock Exchange. Class A shares aren't traded.    At yesterday's annual meeting, Katharine Graham, chairman and chief executive officer, also said: &quot;Although the company won't equal the 56% gain in pro forma earnings per share reported for the first quarter, 1988 will be an excellent year.&quot; She wasn't more specific.    For 1987, the company earned $132.4 million, or $10.30 a share, up 32% from 1986. The profit excluded one-time gains of $54.3 million from the sale of certain interests. Revenue totaled $1.32 billion, up 8% from 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
