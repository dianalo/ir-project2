The oil and gas exploration company said PS Colorado agreed to buy a maximum of eight million cubic feet of gas per day. Terms weren't disclosed. Actual quantities of gas sold will depend on the utility's requirements, the company said.    Barrett operates the Grand Valley project and holds a 27.5% working interest in a majority of the 43 successful wells the partners have drilled on portions of the project. Barrett said the PS Colorado contract brings maximum daily production under contract to 18 million cubic feet.    Barrett said it expects its 1988 drilling program, which will require the approval of its working-interest partners, to include at least 17 wells, adding gas delivery capacity to the Grand Valley area. </TEXT></DOC>
