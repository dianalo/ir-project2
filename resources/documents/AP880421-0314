Analysts said both announcements demonstrated the evolution ofFort Worth, Texas-based Tandy as a leader in technology.   ``These guys are changing their image from being just a retailerto being an innovator,'' said Clifford Friedman, an analyst withC.J. Lawrence Inc.   Tandy stock rose $2.62{ a share to $45.75 a share inconsolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.   The new personal computer is due for volume shipments in Julyand is likely to be the first on the market that follows the designof International Business Machines Corp.'s year-old PersonalSystem-2.   Dell Computer Corp. of Austin, Texas, announced aPS-2-compatible machine on Monday, but said it would not beavailable until the final quarter of 1988. Tandy's version hastechnological advantages over IBM's own computer.   While a new personal computer was widely expected, Tandy pulleda surprise with its announcement of an unusual compact disk thatcan be repeatedly erased and re-recorded.   Tandy said the compact disk, known as the Thor CD, would havethe advantages of huge storage capacity and high fidelity withoutthe disadvantage of being unalterable.   It will be available for music in 1{ to two years and for dataabout a year after that, once recording and playback devices arebuilt, Tandy said. The Thor CD could also be played _ although notrecorded on _ in standard compact disk players.   Tandy will make Thor CD equipment and license other companies tomake it and expects that some day the invention might yield thecompany ``hundreds of millions of dollars'' a year in additionalprofits from sales and royalties, John Roach, Tandy's chairman andchief executive, said at a New York news conference.   The announcement drew a critical response from the RecordingIndustry Association of America because it would allow people tomake high-quality recordings of commercial compact disks at home.The group has been battling against digital audio tape, anothertechnology that is ideal for copying.   ``We're always concerned about technologies that threaten toenable consumers to infringe on copyrights,'' said spokeswomanTrish Heimers.   Indeed, opposition from the recording industry might hold up theTandy invention, said Leonard Laub, president of Vision Three Inc.,a New York-based consulting firm.   As with music, the Thor CD would allow computer users to createtheir own data libraries.   On its new Tandy 5000 MC personal computer, Tandy tried toassure potential customers that the machine would not be knockeddown by a patent lawsuit by IBM.   The company said the computer was covered by an existing patentcross-licensing agreement with IBM, although it said certain PS-2patents that may be issued to IBM in the future are still subjectto negotiations.   Analysts are betting that IBM will not try to block Tandy. Theysay Tandy's quality is high enough that IBM won't be embarrassed byshoddy goods. And they say the companies are not directcompetitors, with IBM focusing on the Fortune 1000 and Tandyfocusing on what it calls the ``Unfortunate 6 Million'' small andmedium-sized companies.   In addition, some big IBM customers have been telling IBM theywould feel more comfortable buying the Personal System-2 if theyknew there was another company that could serve as a second sourcefor the product.   Tandy seems to have shaken off its image as a company forhobbyists, tinkerers and bargain hunters.   ``Tandy is a class-act company,'' said Esther Dyson, editor ofRelease 1.0, a computer newsletter.   The suggested price for one popular configuration of the Tandy5000 MC with a 40-megabyte hard disk drive is $6,499, compared to$6,995 for IBM's PS-2 Model 80 with a 44-megabyte hard disk drive.</TEXT></DOC>
