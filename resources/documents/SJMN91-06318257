Would theWestern world be silent? Of course not. It would react in outrage. It wouldintervene to stop such a crime against history and humanity.;   But across theAdriatic today, another historic jewel of a city, Dubrovnik, is beingdevastated, its population strangled by blockade. And where are the world'sprotests? Where is any effective action to stop the crime?  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BUT WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE?BOMBING OF DUBROVNIK IS A CRIME  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Anthony Lewis is a New York Times columnist.  </MEMO><TEXT>     President Bush has not been reluctant to condemn aggression in the world,or to play an active peacemaking role. But in the Yugoslav conflict theAmerican voice has been muted. Why?;   The answer to the puzzle must lie inpart, I believe, in memories of what happened in Yugoslavia during World WarII and afterward. Political memory has inhibited our recognition of, andwillingness to deal with, a new Yugoslav reality.;   During the war, Tito andhis partisans fought courageously against the occupying Nazi armies, whileCroatian fascists set up a pro-Nazi puppet state. Afterward Tito, as presidentof a communist Yugoslavia, broke with Stalin: the first such defiance in thecommunist world and one that won Yugoslavia much admiration and support in theWest.;   That past must help to explain the cold shoulder that the republicsof Croatia and Slovenia got from the United States and other Western countrieswhen they declared their independence earlier this year. Otherwise, one wouldhave expected sympathy for democratic movements seeking independence from acommunist-dominated central government.;   The tragedy that has overtakenYugoslavia is the direct result of the ambitions of the Serbian CommunistParty leader, Slobodan Milosevic. Over the last four years he has schemed toimpose Serbian domination -- and his own -- on federal Yugoslavia. When hecould, he brutally suppressed opponents, such as the Albanian majority inSerbia's province of Kosovo.;   The Milosevic grab for power aroused in otherrepublics opposition that was both ethnic and democratic -- anti-communist --in character. When Croatia declared its independence June 25, Milosevicresponded with war. His instrument is the federal army, whose officers aremostly Serbs.;   In the attacks since June 25, the federal army has capturedabout a third of Croatia's territory. It has used planes to bomb Croatianvillages and cities, as well as shells and mortars and infantry attacks.;  The attacks on Dubrovnik best illustrate the nature of Milosevic's war: itspunitive nature. Dubrovnik is at the southern end of a thin strip of Croatiarunning down the Adriatic coast. It does not block the way to anything, and itis hard to see what military value it has as a target. It seems, in fact, tohave been targeted for psychological and cultural reasons.;   Dubrovnik is aRenaissance port, beautifully preserved, a gem not only of Croatia but of allEurope. The United Nations has declared it a cultural landmark. Right nowbombs are falling on the city every day. For nearly a month the federalblockade has cut off regular supplies of food, water and electricity.;   TheEuropean Community has tried to act diplomatically, appointing Lord Carringtonas its crisis representative. He has brokered cease-fire after cease-fire, butMilosevic pays no attention to them. Lord Carrington, despite his greatabilities, is reduced to deploring the attack on Dubrovnik as a &quot;criminalact.&quot;;   It is a criminal act; but nobody does anything serious about thecriminal, Milosevic. It is true, and understandable, that the United States isordinarily reluctant to assist the ethnic breakup of other countries. But weare well past that point now.;   There is no Yugoslavia anymore. There arerepublics as independent in their feelings as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.There is an attempt to impose on them by force either Serbian domination or aGreater Serbia enlarged with territory seized from its neighbors. And that useof force may have wider reverberations.;   &quot;The danger that is coming fromYugoslavia may be deeper and longer than the international community hasrealized,&quot; President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia said during his visit toWashington three weeks ago. It is time to listen, and to act.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ANTHONY LEWIS  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911113  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  721  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, November 13, 199100318257,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
