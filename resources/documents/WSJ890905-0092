The nation's civilian unemployment rate remained a low 5.2% last month, the Labor Department said. During the month businesses added 110,000 new workers -- a number the department said would have been nearly double had it not been for 108,000 workers removed from payroll counts because of strikes. Counting military personnel, the rate dropped to 5.1% from 5.2%.    &quot;I think they {the employment numbers} have to be regarded as another indicator that the economy is still firmly established on a sustainable growth path,&quot; said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. &quot;How strong the track is, is very difficult to say, but it's indicative of an economy still at a level of full employment.&quot;    But a closely watched private survey of buyers for the nation's factories shows manufacturing stumbling in August for the fourth consecutive month. The monthly index of the National Association of Purchasing Management slipped in August to 45.2% from 46% in July. A reading below 50% indicates that U.S. manufacturing generally is declining.    &quot;I would see that bordering on recessionary,&quot; says Daniel Friel, an economist at NCNB Corp., a large bank holding company in Charlotte, N.C. The survey asks buyers whether such factors as production, new orders, inventories and employment are up or down. An index of consumer confidence compiled by the Conference Board also dimmed the economic outlook. The index dropped six points last month, to 114.7. Nevertheless consumer confidence remains &quot;in the context of the survey's history reassuringly strong,&quot; said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's consumer research center.    And a newly released July figure, the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators -- designed to foretell economic activity six to nine months hence -- rose 0.2%, the first increase since April. Moreover, a 0.1% decline originally reported for June was revised upward to the same as May.    But the department also said that declining interest rates failed to boost construction spending significantly after a 0.9% drop the month before.    The economy seems to be at a crossroads, and statistics from a couple of months aren't conclusive evidence of the path it is taking. Still, Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., believes, &quot;What we see here is an economy which still is growing, but growing sluggishly and also growing sporadically.&quot;    Clearly, the one big blotch on the economy is manufacturing. &quot;Consumer-related industries are making somewhat of a comeback,&quot; Mr. Steinberg says, citing recent gains in car sales. &quot;But the industrial sector {as a whole} is fading and continuing to fade.&quot;    The employment report underscored the weakness in manufacturing. Although the big auto companies rehired a number of workers, the number of manufacturing jobs in the economy showed little change in August, the Labor Department said. Employment in the electrical equipment industry continued to decline, bringing job losses there to 40,000 since November.    Many economists blame a tapering in growth of exports, which soared in the face of a declining dollar over much of the past two years, giving U.S. manufacturers a boost.    Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the purchasing manager's survey panel disagrees. &quot;The continued strength in the new export-order index is something of a surprise,&quot; he says. &quot;You would think the strong dollar would begin to catch up with export orders, but so far it hasn't.&quot;    Last week the government revised its calculation of the economy's inflation-adjusted growth in the second quarter a full percentage point, to 2.7% from 1.7%. And for the time being, many recession forecasts appear to have vanished.    But Jeffery Bell, president Bell Mueller Cannon, an economic forecasting firm in Washington, is one who still believes the economy is headed for a mild downturn, beginning in the fourth quarter. &quot;You feel like it's falling off a cliff. We think the cliff is going to come in the fourth quarter,&quot; he says.    For the past few months, the index of leading indicators had been signaling just such a crash course. It declined four times between February and June, the government reported, although Friday the June drop was revised away. But in July five of the index's 11 components showed signs of increased strength, including rising stock prices, growing capital-goods orders and an expanding money supply. The result was the modest upturn.    Many economists and the Federal Reserve have been hoping for a slowing economy in order to reduce demand pressures that cause inflation. The Labor Department's employment report said the average hourly earnings of American workers dipped one cent in August, to $9.69. That suggests businesses face less pressure to raise prices to cover rising costs of compensating workers. But for working Americans the stagnant wages aren't necessarily good news. Inflation is still running around 5% for the year.    Figures in all the reports are adjusted for seasonal variations.    Overall construction spending grew to $415.7 billion in July from $415.6 billion in June, a statistically insignificant change. Measured in 1982 dollars to eliminate the effects of inflation, spending fell 0.3% in July.    ---   James T.
