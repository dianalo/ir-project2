Hilsman, president and chief executive officer, said.    Since its inception in 1981, IMM has posted mounting losses. Last year, it reported a net loss of $21.4 million on revenue of $4.3 million.    &quot;We were hoping to become profitable this year,&quot; Mr. Hilsman explained. &quot;But orders didn't come through as expected.&quot; Profit next year will be hampered by huge research and development costs on a new digital cellular-telephone system.    The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association last year called for manufacturers to produce such a system, to increase capacity. IMM and other telecommunication equipment makers are racing to fill this need, and systems are expected on the market next year.    IMM makes Ultraphone systems that connect rural homes to the phone network by using digital radio signals. It has had difficulty getting big contracts. But with Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp., as a supporter, Mr. Hilsman believes customers will increase. &quot;The partnership is critical to us,&quot; he said.    IMM, which yesterday got Ultraphone orders from Contel Corp., Citizens Utilities Co. and Pacific Telecom Inc., also hopes to win Hughes itself as a customer.    To help attain profitability, IMM has restructured operations as profit and loss centers and has hired a new chief operating officer, Richard W. Pryor, who previously was executive vice president of the Electric Data Systems Communications unit of General Motors.    Hughes invested $10 million in IMM last month and received 400,000 shares of a new series of IMM convertible preferred stock. IMM said that investment will give it the cash and expertise needed to perfect and manufacture a digital cellular-telephone system and to compete in that market with American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., Motorola Inc. and Northern Telecom Ltd.    &quot;We can't compete against the giants -- Motorola and ATandamp;T. But Hughes can,&quot; Mr. Hilsman said. &quot;We design the technology and Hughes will manufacture it.&quot; IMM said Hughes has agreed to help with product development and marketing, too, allowing it to cut costs by closing field offices in Atlanta, Denver and Washington. </TEXT></DOC>
