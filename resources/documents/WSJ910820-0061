Should the West have helped the ousted presidentmore, or did we help him too much?   Those who believe the former argue that with more aid fromthe West Mr. Gorbachev -- the man with whom we were told wecould do business -- could somehow have turned the Sovieteconomy around, miraculously radiating incentives from Moscowthrough the crumbling empire and preserving the gains ofperestroika, both internal (such as they were) and external.</LP><TEXT>   If only, this thinking goes, poor Mr. Gorbachev had notbeen sent away empty-handed from the London G-7 summit lastmonth, he might yet be in office and his military &quot;friends&quot;would never have turned on him.   But the trouble with this thesis is that it is rooted infantasy. There was never the slightest chance thatMoscow-directed plans, whether under Mr. Gorbachev or anyoneelse, could trigger the rise of wealth creation andenterprise throughout all of the republics.   The emergency committee, or junta, that has now taken overis in just the same fix as the man it has ousted. But whereMr. Gorbachev used sweet talk and political maneuvering, theleaders of the coup may now try using bayonets and tanks.   But either way the outcome is the same. The system theyare seeking to operate is unworkable. There is no way inwhich the great shambling entity called the U.S.S.R., heldtogether by a network of Communist Party, military and policecontrol, can be ordered by those same authorities to behavelike free and independent peoples, making their own choicesand creating their own prosperity. To do that, power must bein the hands of the people.   It is true that Mr. Gorbachev was to have signed a treatytoday that would have given some of the republics more say intheir economic affairs. He also made some half-heartedattempts to dilute Communist Party domination, but heremained strongly opposed to any real measures that wouldhave limited Communist power.   Was he really about to let the republics freely decidetheir own relations with Moscow and each other? Was he aboutto return all property to the individual? Was he going to letanyone who wished hire and fire people, buy an office bloc,advertise, take money in and out of the country?   Of course he wasn't. The ousted president was a product ofa centralized, party-dominated system whose leaders werenever elected by any recognizable democratic procedures. Mr.Gorbachev was determined to reduce the economic burden of hiscountry's Cold War relations with the rest of the globe anddiscard costly foreign commitments. Somehow he had to ease,albeit marginally, the military's overwhelming dead weight onthe Soviet economy.   This he did, with excellent consequences for global peaceand, in particular, for the future of Europe. But at home hefailed utterly to understand that Moscow's economic andpolitical power had to be not merely shared but surrenderedif markets were to work.   His successors understand even less, as all their talk ofpreserving the &quot;territory integrity, freedom and independenceof our fatherland&quot; confirms. The bread queues will lengthen,the anger will mount, the ruble will continue to turn topulp. Until the democrats in the individual republics trulytake power from the Kremlin centralists, there is very littlethe outside world can do about this unfolding Russiantragedy.   The prime interest of the international community must nowbe in preserving the rest of Europe from the chronic Sovietinfection. Since there are still hundreds of thousands ofSoviet troops on German soil and tens of thousands in Polandand elsewhere, this is certainly not ensured. Poland looksparticularly vulnerable, as it is now facing a huge newbudget crisis and collapsing faith in its electedpoliticians.   Two factors will decide how things develop in Sovietexternal affairs. First, there is the question of whether theSoviet military is any more of a unified and coherentinstitution than the Soviet Union itself. The generals inMoscow may find it impossible to make their military obeytheir orders, although we must not gamble on this.   Second, the new hard-line leaders may want to leave Mr.Gorbachev's cooperative foreign policy in place for the timebeing, despite its obvious humiliations for the Soviet armedforces. In other words, their claims that they want to &quot;carryon&quot; with Mr. Gorbachev's economic reforms may extend both tointernal and external changes.   The difference is that the external changes were working-- mainly because they have been largely taken out of Soviethands -- whereas the internal changes were not. But carryingon with the Gorbachev line internally can only mean carryingon down the dark path of poverty, food shortages and chaos.What didn't work before will be even less likely to work now,however impatient the military and the KGB get.   But perhaps the silver lining to it all may be that atleast the eyes of many Russians and the other numerous&quot;Soviet&quot; nationalities will now be opened wide, as will bethe eyes of apologists around the world who have beeninsisting that the Soviet system be kept intact.   While the line they were getting from the Gorbachevadministration sounded decent, constitutional and evendemocratic (although perhaps not quite that to the Balticstates), it was still wrong. The line they will get from thenew team, if it can maintain its hold on power, will beundisguisedly authoritarian. It will be to continue doingwhat the Moscow planners and bosses dictate.   This scenario will be recognizable to every Sovietcitizen. It is the old familiar recipe of central controlthat over the years has led them all, and their neighbors, toutter disaster.   This time they may just have the necessary will andconfidence to reject it and throw it over for good. But thiswill take enormous, fresh quantities of tremendous courage onthe part of the battered Soviet people and their aspiringdemocratic leaders. The world should stand right behind themin their struggle.   ---   Mr. Howell is chairman of the British House of CommonsSelect Committee on Foreign Affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
