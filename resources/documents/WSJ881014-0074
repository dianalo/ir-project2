If the three-year contracts are ratified in votes scheduled to begin Saturday, the workers, members of the Communications and Electrical Workers of Canada, could be back at work by Oct. 23. Two previous settlements negotiated by Bell Canada, a unit of Montreal-based BCE Inc., and the union were rejected by workers, whose contracts expired last November.    Details of the new tentative pact weren't released, but both sides said Bell Canada, Canada's largest telephone utility, improved its previous offer. The main issues in the dispute were wages, job security and union demands for pensions indexed to the inflation rate. </TEXT></DOC>
