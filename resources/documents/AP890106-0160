The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuitsaid the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the chiefregulator of nationally chartered banks, properly permitted Citibankto purchase the American Municipal Bond Assurance Corp., known asAMBAC.   The decision by Comptroller Robert L. Clarke had been challengedby the American Insurance Association as a violation of the BankHolding Company Act. Citibank is owned by Citicorp, a bank holdingcompany regulated by the Federal Reserve Board.   The insurance association, after losing in U.S. District Court,won an appeal. In August, the appeals panel said the Bank HoldingCompany Act, and thus Federal Reserve jurisdiction applied. Friday'sruling, however, reverses that part of the August decision.   Even though Citibank is a nationally chartered bank, StephenVerdier, an attorney with the Independent Bankers Association ofAmerica, said the latest court ruling represents a blow to aproposal by the Federal Reserve to extend its jurisdiction over theactivities of subsidiaries of state banks owned by holding companies.   The Fed in November proposed a regulation requiring state banksowned by holding companies to get its permission before establishingreal estate, insurance and other non-banking operations, even whenstate law permits the operations. Banks have opposed the Fedproposal as a power grab.   ``The significance obviously goes well beyond whether Citibankcan own an insurance subsidiary. ... It really pulls the rug outfrom under the Federal Reserve,'' Verdier said.   Stephen Katsanos, a spokesman for the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., which insures bank deposits and is the primary regulator ofstate-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve,said FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman was ``quite pleased'' with thedecision.   ``It tracks very well with his philosophy that banks should beallowed to expand their activities through bank affiliates orsubsidiaries provided adequate safeguards are set up,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
