What is unusual about these new swap futures contracts isthat the huge banks and securities firms running the swapsmarket seem eager to use them.</LP><TEXT>   Over the past two decades, Chicago's two major futuresexchanges have launched dozens of new futures contracts, manyof which failed. Those that stumbled were unable, for onereason or another, to attract participation by the biginstitutions dominating whatever commodity or financialinstrument that was covered by the futures.   But bankers, the big players in the swaps market, say theyare likely to embrace the new futures, because thestill-deteriorating health of the banking industry has madethe off-exchange swaps market riskier.   That market has grown explosively in the past five years,although the theory behind it -- hedging against adversemoves in prices or, in this case, interest rates -- isn'tnew. Hog and soybean farmers, as well as flour millers andtextile makers, have done this sort of thing for decades.   Corporations and government agencies make huge interestpayments, and they can be hurt badly if interest rates rise.So they enter into financial arrangements called swaps, inwhich they might trade their exposure to floating interestrates for a fixed rate, or vice versa.   If a bank or a securities firm didn't have another partyready to take the opposite side of the swap, it wouldaccommodate its corporate or government client by enteringinto the swap agreement itself. This keeps the customerhappy, but exposes the bank or securities firm to the risk ofinterest rates moving the wrong way. These financialinstitutions would in turn hedge this risk elsewhere, usuallyby making an offsetting interest-rate swap with another bank.   But with more U.S. banks in more trouble, the marketmakers in swaps have fewer places to re-hedge while theirbusiness booms along.   &quot;These days, you can't just have people delivering swapsback and forth,&quot; says Jon Anderson, head of derivativeproducts trading in French bank Credit Agricole's New Yorkoffice. &quot;There are problems in terms of whether people willaccept other people's credit.&quot;   Ironically, these problems may help the Board of Trade'snew futures contract get off to a flying start by offeringswap-arranging banks a new hedging vehicle. &quot;The swaps markethas gotten so big that some dealers are beginning to choke ontheir success,&quot; says Gilbert Leistner, a CBOT trader whohelped design the exchange's new contract. &quot;They'd like to domore swaps, but their accountants are telling them: `Look,you just can't do any more business with these people.'&quot;   In a swap, the hedge is only as good as the financialhealth of both parties involved. If one party defaults, thebank that arranged the swap loses its protection frominterest-rate risk. By hedging with the Board of Trade's newcontracts, a bank essentially passes along its exposure torisk-takers in the futures market, where the transaction isbacked by the exchange.   For this and other reasons, some banks already are sayingthey plan to use the CBOT's contracts -- a surprisingdeparture from the usual wait-and-see attitude.   &quot;We're going to use them three different ways,&quot; says W.Robert Felker, president of First Chicago Futures Inc., asubsidiary of the First National Bank of Chicago. &quot;We'regoing to broker them to our customers, use them in ourrisk-management program, and we will be a trader on theexchange floor to help get the contract started.&quot;   Banks are much more familiar with futures than they usedto be. They are big users of Eurodollar futures contracts, ahugely popular instrument traded at the Chicago MercantileExchange and based on fluctuations in short-term interestrates. They frequently use combinations of Eurodollar futuresto build hedges for swaps that last for one, two or threeyears.   For swaps that last longer than three years, however, somebankers think the Board of Trade's swap contracts will bemore effective. &quot;You can do the same thing with fewertrades,&quot; says William Webster, a senior manager inrisk-management at ANZ Bank in London.   Mr. Webster also says the new contracts will createopportunities for arbitrage -- in which banks or securitiestraders try to capitalize on price discrepancies betweenfinancial markets, such as playing Eurodollar futures at theMerc against swap futures at the CBOT.   The CBOT will offer contracts on three-and five-yearinterest-rate swaps. It will determine the value of thecontracts by surveying seven randomly selected swaps dealersfrom a pool of more than a dozen big banks and securitiesfirms.</TEXT></DOC>
