<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-78-1154 </DOCNO><TEXT>A number of scientific groups have examined the effect of carbon dioxideand they are unanimous in the belief that the absorption and re-emissionof the outgoing radiation (the so-called greenhouse effect) by CO{sub2} will cause a gradual warming of the climate over a period of hundredyears. The models also estimate the cloud coverage and predict a decreasein cloudiness in the tropics and in the rain-bearing belts around theequator. The role of clouds in establishing a radiation balance is verycomplex and its importance vis-a-vis the evolution of global climatehas only been realized recently. Reflection of solar radiation from cloudtops (the albedo effect) can cause cooling, while the absorption of outgoingradiation by water vapor and droplets in the cloud can cause heating(by adding to the greenhouse effect of CO{sub 2} and other pollutants).Which of the above two effects dominate depends upon the extent and natureof cloud coverage.</TEXT></DOC>
