No, he said, it doesn't do any good.   A few weeks after a man opened fire with an AK-47 in a schoolyardin Stockton, Calif., George Bush, who had come to office just asadamant as Reagan on gun control, switched signals.   His administration imposed a temporary ban, now made permanent,on imports of semiautomatic weapons deemed to have no legitimatesporting purposes.   Slowly, without calling attention to the process, the Bushadministration has turned away from positions firmly held by RonaldReagan and warmly endorsed in 1988 by candidate Bush.   In place of a ``Reagan evolution'' is a Bush evolution.   Now, six months after Bush stepped into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,there's evidence aplenty that the new conservative president hasparted company from the old conservative president.   On Mideast policy, pollution issues, the minimum wage, thedefense budget, budgetary matters in general; on Star Wars and thesale of oil leases, aid to the Contras and fuel economy standardsfor automobiles, Bush has abandoned the Reagan agenda for his ownpositions. Usually they are more to the left of where Reagan stood.   Political analysts aren't surprised.   ``Some change is inevitable,'' says C. Lowell Harris, formerexecutive director of the Academy of Political Science. ``After fouror eight years, there are bound to be occasions where new looks atthings _ even by people who are fundamentally sympathetic to theearlier policies _ are inevitable.''   Stephen Hess, a political scientist at the Brookings Institution,says a vice president, after years in the shadows, has a visceralneed ``to show his differences, to show a streak of independence''when he takes over as No. 1.   ``Bush would say there is more that's alike than different, andhe would probably be right,'' Hess says, ``but what's different iswhat's interesting and what makes news.''   William Schneider of the American Enterprise Institute says eachman revealed his own character in his presidency.   Reagan was ``an agenda president'' who appointed people likeEdward Meese III, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Elliott Abrams, Oliver North tocarry out his agenda _ and theirs, he says.   Bush, on the other hand, is an ``in-basket president _ you figureout what the problems are and you deal with them.''   Here are some places where Bush has abandoned Reagan policies:</TEXT><TEXT>   CONTRA AID. Reagan once summed up his policy toward the leftistNicaraguan government in two words: ``Say Uncle.'' For eight years,he did whatever he could to help the Contras overthrow thatgovernment. When Congress cut off funds for military aid, theIran-Contra affair resulted.   Just two months into office, Bush struck a deal with Congressthat gave up Reagan's goal. The new president made it clear he waswilling to accept a future in which the leftist Sandinistas remainin power in Managua.   Much like a treaty between nations, a four-page agreement wassigned by Bush and congressional leaders after secret negotiationson Capitol Hill by Secretary of State James A. Baker III.   It provided $4.5 million a month in non-lethal aid to theContras, chiefly intended to encourage them to return home andbattle the Sandinistas in the political rather than the militaryarena. Even that limited aid would be cut off automatically if theContras engaged in military attacks or cross-border incursions.</TEXT><TEXT>   STAR WARS: With great fanfare, in a television speech to thenation on March 23, 1983, Reagan announced plans for a space-baseddefense system against intercontinental missiles _ the system thatbecame known as Star Wars.   ``I've become more and more deeply convinced that the humanspirit must be capable of rising above dealing with other nationsand human beings by threatening their existence,'' said a presidentwhose commitment to the idea was evident to anyone watching.   Billions of dollars later, Bush appears to be edging away fromthe Reagan commitment. The first clue of that came from John G.Tower, while he was still hopeful of being confirmed as secretary ofdefense.   Tower testified that he personally did not believe ``that we candevise an ... umbrella that can protect the entire Americanpopulation from nuclear incineration.''   An ``umbrella'' exactly like that was the Star Wars goal thatReagan envisioned.   Bush cut spending on the program to $4.6 billion for fiscal 1990,down from the $5.9 billion Reagan had proposed. Defense SecretaryDick Cheney also announced that Bush would shift the focus of StarWars from deployment sometime in the 1990s to research on a moreadvanced system known as ``Brilliant Pebbles,'' consisting of 3,000to 5,000 small orbiting satellites, each capable of tracking anddestroying an intercontinental ballistic missile.   Whether Bush will be any more willing than Reagan to use StarWars as a bargaining chip in arms control negotiations with theSoviets remains to be seen.</TEXT><TEXT>   MIDEAST: The Reagan administration opened contacts with thePalestine Liberation Organization, but was careful to go no furtherthan nudge the Israelis toward seeking a settlement with the Arabs.Substance did not change, but emphasis did in the Bushadministration.   The nudge became a shove when Baker replaced Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz.   Two speeches show the change in tone.   Shultz, on Sept. 16, 1988: ``Israel will never negotiate from orreturn to the lines of partition. But it must be prepared towithdraw ... from territories occupied in the recent conflict.''   Baker, on May 22, telling Israel to ``forswear annexation'' ofthe occupied territories: ``Now is the time to lay aside, once andfor all, the unrealistic vision of a greater Israel.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
