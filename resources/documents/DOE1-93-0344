The averagemaximum subsidence was 1.07 m (3.5 ft). The average maximum compressivestrain recorded was 0.008 mm/mm. Three predictive methods for the determinationof displacements and strains were compared: The National Coal Board (NCB)graphical method, the profile method with empirical constants determinedfor southeastern Ohio, and a finite element excavation program. Excellentsubsidence agreement was found with the profile method, and reasonablestrain agreement was determined with the finite element program.</TEXT></DOC>
