According to defense sources, who asked not to be named, DeputyDefense Secretary William H. Taft IV is receptive to the idea andhas asked his staff to draft a directive that would implement thechanges on Jan. 1.   Taft would normally be the top Pentagon official to deal withsuch matters. But several congressmen have now asked DefenseSecretary Frank C. Carlucci to intervene, calling the proposal``ill advised (and) hastily conceived.''   ``This is a very dangerous precedent for commissary and exchangeoperation, and it tampers with a very important fringe benefit forservicemen,'' Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, said in an interview.   ``It would really penalize the people assigned overseas.''   Leath, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee'smorale, welfare and recreation panel, said the two Democrats andtwo Republicans who serve on that panel with him had joined inwriting to Carlucci last week. They include Reps. Bill Nichols,D-Ala.; Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass.; David O'B. Martin, R-N.Y., andJack Davis, R-Ill.   If Carlucci doesn't stop the plan from going forward, ``then weare prepared to stop it legislatively,'' Leath declared.   The idea of changing tobacco and alcohol sales policies wasadvanced quietly last Sept. 28 by the Defense Resources Board, thePentagon's highest-ranking review board for military programs.   Maj. David Super, a Pentagon spokesman, on Wednesdayacknowledged the board's action and agreed the department wasconsidering changes, but said he knew of no tentative decisionshaving been made by Taft.   ``The DRB has made the recommendation to change salespolicies,'' Super said.   ``This would be another step in an on-going effort to promotegood health for service members and dependents _ smoking cessationand deglamorization of alcohol. The price increases also couldgenerate more morale, welfare and recreation funds.''   The sources said the plan being considered by Taft would removeall tobacco products from the commissaries _ or military grocerystores _ and allow their sale only at the post exchanges, which aremore like drug stores.   Cigarettes sold at the exchanges would be priced near regularretail rates, and liquor prices within the exchange system wouldalso be raised to within 5 percent of the local civilian market,the sources said.   In addition to the congressional opposition, Taft has received amemo from Grant S. Green Jr., the assistant secretary for forcemanagement and personnel, opposing any change in commissary andexchange policy, the sources said.   Green is also asserting that any sales ban or price hikes wouldbe perceived by servicemen as a reduction in benefits.   The Defense Department, through an educational campaign launchedby former Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, has been attempting toreduce the use of cigarettes and alcohol among active-dutyservicemen for more than two years.   That war on smoking was touched off in March 1986 afterWeinberger considered _ and then rejected _ a ban on the sale ofcigarettes or an increase in tobacco prices at military stores.   Weinberger shied away from that step because he said he fearedsetting a precedent that would allow the singling out of particularproducts for special pricing.   Currently, all products sold at commissaries are priced at costplus a 5 percent surcharge. In the case of cigarettes, thatproduces a roughly 35 percent discount compared to retail prices.   ``This is a very dangerous precedent for the system as awhole,'' Leath said, echoing Weinberger's point.   ``If they can do it with alcohol and tobacco, then what's next?Raise the price of butter because the cholesterol is bad for you?''</TEXT></DOC>
