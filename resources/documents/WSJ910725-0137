Output by the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries is exceeding 23 million barrels a day, according tooutside monitors. That rate is nearly one million barrels aday above production levels earlier this year and close tothe 23.3 million OPEC averaged a year ago just before Iraq'sAug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.</LP><TEXT>   With both Iraq and Kuwait still out of the picture, thisoutput rate means that the other leading producers arerunning flat out again. Saudi Arabia, which has led thesurge, is now producing 8.2 million barrels a day, up from8.1 million in June and 7.5 million in May, said CristinaHaus, who monitors OPEC production for Washington-basedEnergy Security Analysis.   The leap in production has cut OPEC's spare capacity tothe bone. That is one reason oil prices have continuedrelatively firm at around $20 to $21 a barrel for better U.S.grades despite the depressed use of fuels such as gasoline.   In the pricing outlook for the remainder of the year,analysts agree that much depends on whether economic recoverybrings the fourth-quarter turnaround in sluggish petroleumdemand as expected. Also, the status of Iraq and Kuwait addsto the uncertainties.   The push by Iraq for United Nations permission to exportas much as $2.6 billion of its embargoed oil for food andmedicine purchases already has led to some softening in oilprices this week although crude futures rose slightly in U.S.trading yesterday. And over the weekend, Kuwait plans toexport its first crude cargo of two million barrels since theIraqi occupation.   Many oil analysts rule out any significant exports fromeither Iraq or Kuwait until well into 1992. Still, somepredict prices may drop sharply this quarter and then reboundbefore year end.   &quot;The supply-demand balance suggests that the markets arecurrently oversupplied and that inventories are about fivedays higher than normal,&quot; said Michael Rothman and JohnGambino, vice presidents and senior analysts at MerrillLynch, in a recent report. &quot;We would not be surprised if oilprices were to experience another pullback during the summermonths of $2 to $3 a barrel from current levels,&quot; they added.   The Merrill Lynch analysts expect, nevertheless, that oilsupplies could become tight late this year or early next yearas demand rises seasonally as well as cyclically. The pairsaid the price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmarkcrude, should approach $25 a barrel toward year end.   William H. Brown III, international oil analyst at Kidder,Peabody andamp; Co., expects the WTI price to peak late thisquarter at $24 a barrel. In the fourth quarter, he looks forprices to return to around $22 a barrel, falling to $20 orless in next year's first quarter. &quot;Everybody is looking at atight fourth quarter,&quot; he said, &quot;but prices tend to discountevents one quarter ahead.&quot;   Although petroleum consumption is currently sluggish, Mr.Brown suggested that world oil inventories are beingincreased at a rate of nearly one million barrels a day. As aresult, he said, the requirement for OPEC oil will remainaround 23.5 million barrels a day for both the third andfourth quarters.   Not only oil buyers appear to be stocking up. Some of theproducing countries also are rebuilding inventories. SaudiArabia, OPEC's leading producer, had drawn down much of itstanker-stored oil in April and May. But Conrad Gerber, thepresident of Petro-Logistics Ltd. who monitors OPEC'ssupplies from Geneva, said there has been a major surge intanker loadings in Saudi Arabia in recent weeks. &quot;The Saudisbegan shipping out heavily toward the end of June-more than10 million barrels a day some days,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
