The RPL is the mechanismagencies use to give reemployment consideration to employees separatedby reduction in force, or recovered from a compensable injury after morethan 1 year. These changes are intended to improve the operation of theRFL and clarify requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>December 8, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Leota Shelkey, (202) 632-6817.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Veterans' Preference Act of 1944extended reemployment eligibility to preference eligibles furloughed orseparated without delinquency or misconduct. This provision, now at 5 U.S.C.3315, is the basis for the Reemployment Priority List (RPL) for employeesseparated by reduction in force (RIF). Coverage for employees who havefully recovered from a compensable injury after more than 1 year is basedon 5 U.S.C. 8151(b)(2).On January 7, 1988, OPM published proposed revisions to the RPL regulationsin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 408). We received 13 written commentsfrom Federal agencies and employee organizations. The key comments andchanges are summarized below. In addition, several editorial changes weremade.a. Proposed andSection; 330.201 would permit an agency to operate an alternativeplacement program as an exception to the RPL requirement. In the finalregulation, we have clarified that OPM prior approval is necessary forsuch an exception. Also, we have changed the definition of ``agency'' tomean ``Executive agency,'' which is used for reduction-in-force coveragein 5 U.S.C. 3501 and is defined in 5 U.S.C. 105. This allows all the Departmentof Defense agencies to use a single RPL.b. Proposed andSection; 330.202(a)(1) would require an individual to filean application for the RPL within 30 days after the RIF separation dateand would require an agency to enroll the individual on the RPL within10 days thereafter. One commenter suggested we drop the requirement foran application because employees often don't know the jobs for which theyare qualified.We have not adopted this suggestion because we believe the use of an employee-completedapplication is more advantageous and efficient than the existing system.We plan, however, to advise agencies to give employees guidance in completingan application. Although several commenters suggested less specific deadlines,we have retained the proposed 30-day and 10-day limits as easier to administer.Three commenters opposed the provision in andSection; 330.202(a)(1) thatwould permit employees to receive consideration for positions with workschedules different from the schedule worked at the time of separation.Although the proposal was intended to provide broader placement consideration,the commenters felt it extended placement rights inconsistent with thatavailable under RIF procedures and also limited management flexibility.In consideration of these concerns, we have given agencies discretion inthe final regulations to adopt provisions permitting employees to requestconsideration for positions having different work schedules.c. Proposed andSection; 330.203(a) covered eligibility based on RIF separation.A new provision would deny RPL eligibility if an employee's last ratingof record for RIF purposes was unacceptable. Six commenters suggested that,instead, individuals be required to have a rating of at least fully successful.Two commenters suggested that the performance rating requirement be droppedaltogether. For the following reasons, we have decided to retain the requirementas proposed.Performance requirements have been incorporated into a number of otherprograms_pay, within grade increases, merit promotion. More specifically,the RIF regulations deny displacement rights to any employee whose currentrating is unacceptable. A RIF and subsequent RPL eligibility are so closelylinked that it would be inconsistent to ignore an unacceptable rating andgrant reemployment priority <T3>after</T3> an employee's separation when placement rights <T3>before</T3> separation were denied because of that unacceptable rating.Similarly, it would be inconsistent to negate reemployment eligibilityof an employee whose rating is minimally successful when the RIF regulationsdo not refuse displacement rights because of that rating. Furthermore,we believe the proposed requirement represents a balanced approach to achievingharmony between the reemployment and performance management laws.Because some employees, such as administrative law judges, are exempt fromperformance evaluations, we have revised andSection; 330.203(a) to excludethem from the rating requirement.Another commenter suggested that we continue RPL enrollment of employeeswho decline to transfer with their function to another commuting area.RPL eligibility has been limited to employees who receive a RIF separationnotice. Therefore, when employees involved in a transfer of function areseparated by RIF in accordance with 5 CFR Part 351, they may be eligiblefor the RPL. In addition, all employees who are separated for decliningto transfer with their function may receive placement assistance throughthe Displaced Employee Program, which is described in 5 CFR Part 330, SubpartC.d. Proposed andSection; 330.203(c) continued the existing policy of 2-yearenrollment for tenure group I employees and 1-year enrollment for tenuregroup II employees. Three commenters suggested that enrollment be limitedto 1 year for all employees. We have retained the existing policy as moresupportive of placement efforts.One commenter suggested that RPL enrollment should end when an individualdeclines an offer under conditions shown as acceptable in his or her application.The proposed regulations already provide a new, related provision_an individualloses consideration for all grade levels at and below the grade of an offerhe or she declines. If this grade is the same as the last grade held, theindividual's RPL enrollment is ended.e. Proposed andSection; 330.204 covered eligibility based on compensableinjury. One commenter suggested that these provisions should be equivalentto those covering RIF separations. We had done this in the proposed regulationsto the extent possible without violating the injury compensation law. Thus,no change was made in the final regulation.f. Proposed andSection; 330.205 would restrict an agency from making certaintypes of appointments while a qualified RPL enrollee is available. As suggested,we have made several changes.One change is to permit the <T3>transfer</T3> of preference eligibles, just as their reinstatementeligibility is not blocked by the RPL, on the basis that it is illogicalto permit a preference eligible to receive the one type of appointmentand not the other. Another change gives agencies the discretion to exempt30-day special needs appointments and 700-hour temporary appointments ofhandicapped persons. These exceptions are intended to assure that the RPLdoes not prevent an agency from meeting its obligations under other programsor from acting quickly in an emergency. Last, we have clarified that statutoryor regulatory reemployment rights, such as those in 5 CFR Part 352, arenot blocked by the RPL.One commenter suggested that andSection; 330.205 be revised to specify whenan agency must clear the RPL before proceeding with an outside appointment.We concur with this suggestion.This issue is particularly important because the RPL restrictions applyto <T3>all</T3> components of an agency within the commuting area, not justthe component conducting the RIF. Thus, one component may make a job offerjust before another component issues RIF notices. By the time the appointeeenters on duty, eligibles from the other component have been enrolled onthe RPL. It is not good business for the Government to make a firm joboffer to someone who accepts and makes plans to change jobs, sometimesinvolving a geographic move, only to have the Government rescind the joboffer because in the meantime someone has been enrolled on the RPL. Toavoid such awkward situations, we have revised andSection; 330.205 to providethat the RPL must be cleared at the time an agency makes a firm offer ofemployment.g. Proposed andSection; 330.206(a) would limit higher grade job considerationto RPL enrollees who had previously held a higher grade. Four commentersopposed this provision on the basis that priority consideration shouldnot extend beyond the grade from which separated. Our primary intent wasto cover employees who had been downgraded in one RIF prior to the secondRIF in which they were separated and became eligible for the RPL. Since,in this case, both the downgrade and separation are RIF actions, we believeit's fair to give these individuals job consideration up to the highestgrade from which demoted by RIF. We have changed the final regulation toreflect this.h. Proposed andSection; 330.206(b) provided that an individual recoveredfrom a compensable injury is entitled to priority consideration elsewherein the agency if not placed in the former commuting area. Three commentersrequested clarification. The final regulation indicates that the mannerof priority consideration given outside the commuting area is left to thediscretion of the former agency. This provision is not intended, however,to extend priority consideration beyond the time limits given in the regulation.Additional guidance will be provided through the Federal Personnel Manual.i. Proposed andSection; 330.207 provided two options agencies could use inmaking selections from the RPL. Both options would extend veterans preference.Although three commenters suggested that veterans preference be dropped,we have not done so because 5 U.S.C. 3315 requires it.One option provided for rating and ranking eligibles. Based on the suggestionof one commenter, we have revised the final regulation to require thatjob-related evaluation procedures be used to rate eligibles and be appliedfairly and consistently. Another commenter suggested that selection bepermitted from among the ten highest rated eligibles. We cannot adopt thissuggestion because the pertinent provision in the Veterans' PreferenceAct refers to the selection order for competitive examinations, which bystatute follows a rule of three.One commenter suggested that reemployment should be in strict reverse-RIForder, taking into account length of service. We have not adopted thisprocedure because the law does not require it and its use would removeall managerial discretion in making selections from the RPL.j. Proposed andSection; 330.208 contained a revised qualification standardthat is the same as that used in any normal placement action. We had droppedthe existing requirement that, to be basically qualified, an individualmust be able to perform without undue interruption and loss of productivity.Three commenters opposed this change on the basis that an ``undue interruption''standard is appropriate for priority placement. We have not changed theproposed standard because we believe it is appropriate for filling vacancies.Furthermore, both the proposed and final andSection; 330.207(d) permits anagency to make an exception to the RPL selection order when duties cannotbe taken over without undue interruption by a qualified individual on theRPL or one who has higher standing than the one selected.k. Proposed andSection; 330.209 contained a revised standard for filing appealswith the Merit Systems Protection Board. One editorial change was suggested,which we have made.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Date</ITAG>These regulations must be followed for all RPL enrollments occurring onor after the effective date of these regulations.
