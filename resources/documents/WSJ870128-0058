But ironically, the president, without any special effort, is currently recording a major foreign-policy achievement, one that will far outweigh and outlast the so-called &quot;Irangate&quot; firestorm. He is exporting Reaganomics.    The most dramatic achievement of Reaganomics was the 1986 tax reform. At first its principles, particularly the sharp cut in top marginal rates, were greeted skeptically by many ruling parties abroad, with some unexpected exceptions such as India and New Zealand. But then those same parties began to think of what the U.S. reform could do for them politically and to them in economic terms if the U.S. attraction for capital and able individuals became more powerful. They began to act.    The list of countries in various stages of the global tax revolution includes major, lesser and nascent economies: Canada, Japan, France, India, Turkey, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway and the South African black homeland of Ciskei, for example.    Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has approved a tax overhaul that, if cleared by Parliament, will cut individual top tax rates to 50% from 70% and corporate rates to between 40% and 50% from 52.9%. The bloom is taken off by a value-added tax, or VAT, of up to 5% and the elimination of the interest tax exemption for certain small-saver plans. But the overall effect makes Japan part of the global tax revolution.    Canada, which does 80% of its $90 billion of yearly trade with the U.S., legitimately fears that profits, investments, plants and jobs could slip south to the shelter of lower U.S. marginal rates. Ottawa hopes to counter that with a plan that features lower personal levies and a VAT-like business transfer tax. The aim is to close the gaps between Canada's 43% average federal-provincial corporate levy and the comparable 37% American rate, and between the countries' personal tax rates, which, including state and provincial collections, average some 10% higher in Canada.    France's rightist premier, Jacques Chirac, gained office by promising supply-side tax-rate cuts and privatization of state enterprises. His government is moving more slowly than many of us had hoped, but it's moving in the right direction. It will reduce the top individual rate gradually from the current 65% to 60% this year and to 50% next year; the corporate rate drops to 45% in 1987 from 50%.    Progressive West Germans are well aware of Reaganomics (see the Laffer Curve as depicted here in the influential newspaper Welt Am Sonntag) but the Christian Democrats have stubbornly resisted supply-side prescriptions, scheduling the wrong kind of tax cuts (it still measures their size in terms of anticipated revenue losses) and staggering them out to the end of the decade (See accompanying illustration -- WSJ Jan 28, 1987). Setbacks in last weekend's parliamentary elections, and the gains by their coalition partner, the Free Democrats, may alter their thinking. The Free Democrats are the nearest thing Germany has to a supply-side group.    Britain, alas, has been among the laggards. Early on, Mrs. Thatcher's government moved to reduce top marginal rates radically. Then the government started backsliding. The likelihood of an election this year or early next, and Mrs. Thatcher's slipping support could change that. The opposition Labor Party is already talking about tax increases, setting up Mrs. Thatcher for a repeat of the Reagan-Mondale contest. She has pointed out that Britain's lowest rate will soon be higher than the top U.S. rate.    New Zealand's prime minister, David Lange, is an example of a new kind of laborite, one that you could call &quot;supply-side socialist.&quot; He's pressing tax cuts and free trade. President Mitterrand was turning marketward when the voters passed him by, and Italy's Bettino Craxi is displaying some tendencies. (In Turin recently demonstrators took to the streets to demand tax cuts.) In Austria, a feisty supply-side movement, begun less than a year ago, is starting to generate serious debate within a new coalition government.    Politics seldom produce pure and unequivocal trends, particularly on an international scale. Ronald Reagan and his supply-side advisers also need not expect international acclaim for having fostered policies that other national leaders find attractive. But never mind. As we said above, well after &quot;Irangate&quot; is nothing more than a minor historical footnote, the results of the Reagan tax revolution will be positive and long-lasting. </TEXT></DOC>
