Ms. Schaffer, of Itasca, Ill., wanted to buy a Mercury Tracer. But her old Mazda, which she wanted to trade in, wasn't worth the $1,200 she still owed on her five-year loan, a condition the auto industry calls being upside-down. Before she could swing the new deal, she had to borrow from her mother to pay off the Mazda loan. &quot;I felt pretty robbed,&quot; Ms. Schaffer says.    She also should feel pretty typical. More than half the car buyers at many dealerships find themselves in a similar bind, as consumers increasingly turn to longer-term loans. These contracts, for five or more years, mean lower monthly payments -- but they also can mean headaches at trade-in time for owners and dealers.    The customers &quot;get upset. They think: 'This dealer did this to me.' Everybody loses,&quot; says Bruno Polisena, assistant sales manager at Jerome-Duncan Ford in Sterling Heights, Mich.    Actually, most car buyers who borrow are upside-down &quot;as soon as they drive off the lot,&quot; says William E. Odom, chairman of Ford Motor Credit Co., the auto maker's finance arm. But that condition didn't last long for the average owner back when car prices were lower and most loans lasted two or three years.    Those days are long gone, though. Last year the average buyer paid about $13,000 for a new car, the Commerce Department says, up from $6,000 a decade ago. And the higher prices have brought longer loans: More than 70% of Ford Motor Credit and General Motors Acceptance Corp. loans, for example, now extend to at least five years.    But just because car and truck owners want to stretch their payments over five years doesn't mean they want to keep the vehicles that long. Many still prefer to trade in for a new model every two or three years -- and that's where the upside-down pinch hurts. Ironically, the pain extends to the auto makers, whose price hikes helped cause the problem, since upside-down shoppers have a harder time buying new models.    Consider a typical situation. A buyer purchases a $14,000 car, borrowing $11,500 at 12.5%. The example assumes the car loses 50% of its original purchase value over the first two years, and about 6% of its value each year after that. A three-year loan would result in monthly payments of $384; after 11 months, the buyer reaches &quot;positive equity,&quot; meaning the vehicle's trade-in value exceeds the unpaid portion of the loan. The customer who finances the same amount for five years pays only $258 a month, but must wait 37 months to achieve positive equity.    Owners who find they are upside-down when they go to make a trade-in have few options. Some grudgingly decide to keep the car, though that can compound the problem in some cases as the aging car declines further in value. Others wind up borrowing to pay off the old loan, sometimes folding the unpaid amount into the loan for the new vehicle.    Consumers who want to cut the length of time they'll be upside-down on a new purchase have more choices, though some aren't much fun: Buy a cheaper car or truck. Finance for a shorter period. Make a larger down payment. Switch to a lease contract with a term matching the length of time the car is likely to be kept.    Most car buyers aren't comfortable with such strategies, however. &quot;Consumers have been conditioned&quot; by company and dealer advertisements promising &quot;no money down, the lowest payment, the lowest everything,&quot; says Roy V. Smith, president of a Melbourne, Fla., car-finance consulting firm. &quot;It's hard to convince them to take a payment of $290 a month when they can have a payment of $230.&quot;    Moreover, dealership finance managers often push longer-term contracts and smaller down payments because their compensation is based on how much they can persuade customers to finance.    Some dealers are encouraging customers to take shorter contracts, though. Key-Royal Automotive Co., based in Birmingham, Ala., recently decided to emphasize shorter contracts at its 28, mostly GM, dealerships &quot;by paying our people more to sell a deal on 36 months than we do on 48 or 60,&quot; says director Dick Smith. &quot;Now that will, in turn, be less income, but we think in the long haul it will pay off&quot; by bringing in more frequent sales.    Jerome-Duncan, along with some other Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealers, is pushing even shorter terms, with &quot;The Plan,&quot; a special two-year Ford Motor Credit lease developed in conjunction with Half-A-Car Inc., a Philadelphia marketing and consulting firm. The lease offers lower monthly payments than a four-year retail loan contract but requires a down payment, possibly $3,000 or more. This arrangement allows customers to walk away from the vehicle at the end of the term.    Lease programs aren't for everyone, though, especially drivers who put lots of miles on cars or who simply like to own their vehicles. So Ford and GMAC have created retail-sale contracts with lease-like options at the end of the payment term.    GMAC's Buyer's Choice financing and Ford Credit's Customer Option Plan offer lower monthly payments than conventional retail contracts because the payments are based on the difference between the amount financed and the vehicle's estimated value at the end of the term, as set by the finance company. In a regular retail contract, the payments are based simply on the sale price.    Under the new plans, the customer has three alternatives at the end of the contract: keep the vehicle by making a single, final payment equal to the estimated value; refinance the final amount; or return the vehicle to the dealer. Both plans have mileage restrictions, and charge for excess wear and damage. They also charge fees to customers who turn in the vehicles rather than purchase them.    So far, such programs haven't proved popular with consumers, partly because dealers often don't even mention them when discussing finance alternatives. GMAC plans to talk up its Buyer's Choice program at a new finance school it will open soon in Detroit to train dealership personnel. &quot;We know we haven't done a good job of pushing it,&quot; says William Lovejoy, GMAC's group vice president of marketing. He says the company is writing only about 100 Buyer's Choice deals a month out of an average of roughly 200,000 new-vehicle retail contracts.    In addition, GMAC plans to preach the gospel of shorter contract terms and larger down payments at the school -- concepts Mr. Lovejoy believes in so strongly that he pitched them to dealers he buttonholed at a recent golf outing. He says GMAC also plans to spread the word to consumers through retail advertising.    Security Pacific Corp.'s automobile-finance unit plans to test its own guaranteed-value contract at selected Honda dealerships starting this month. Unlike the GMAC and Ford programs, the Security Pacific financing is based on only the purchase price of the car, and monthly payments aren't reduced. But the plan guarantees the dealer will pay a specific repurchase price at the end of the contract.    Such plans could help vehicle owners reduce the time during which they are upside-down by making them &quot;more aware of what the vehicle is really worth&quot; and allowing them to &quot;adjust their financing accordingly, knowing that they can get that guaranteed amount down the road,&quot; says Dennis Lamont, president of Security Pacific Auto Finance Group.    But the program is as much a marketing tool as a financing alternative, because it relies on Honda's reputation for quality vehicles that hold their value. Thus it provides protection -- but to car owners least likely to need it.    ---        Long-Term Loans Keep You Upside-Down Longer   Longer-term car loans reduce monthly payments. But they also lengthen the time it takes to reach &quot;positive equity&quot; -- the point where the vehicle's market value exceeds the unpaid portion of the loan. What follows is a typical situation. A buyer purchases a $14,000 car, borrowing $11,500 at an interest rate of 12.5%. It assumes the car loses 50% of its original purchase value over the first two years, and about 6% of its value each year after that.    TERM OF LOAN        36 MOS.  48 MOS.  60 MOS.  72 MOS.
