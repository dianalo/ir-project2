The rebuff was a victory for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whowants the Congress of People's Deputies to focus on the nation'ssevere economic problems.   The Congress, on the first day of a 10-day session, refused toinclude on its agenda a discussion of Article 6 of theconstitution, which calls the Communist Party ``the leading andguiding force of Soviet society and the nucleus of its politicalsystem.''   But the vote, 1,139 to 839, indicated the idea has gainedstrength among the deputies, who were elected in March. Fifty-sixabstained.   Poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, supporting a move by deputies from theBaltic republics and the reformist Inter-Regional Deputies Group,said: ``Authority must not be only written into one paragraph, butproven every day.''   He later called the vote a ``noble defeat'' since 87 percent ofthe Congress deputies are party members. ``We got 839 votes,''Yevtushenko said. ``I didn't expect that.''   The Baltic republic of Lithuania last week became the first ofthe Soviet Union's 15 republics to replace Article 6 with one thatallows a multiparty system.   As changes sweep Eastern Europe, partly at Gorbachev's behest,Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia have ended the Communistmonopoly on power, and Poland selected the East bloc's firstnon-Communist prime minister. On Monday, Bulgaria's leadershipproposed a multiparty system.   Gorbachev said any issue was open to debate, but warned againstthinking that eliminating Article 6 would solve all the country'stroubles.   ``We cannot start political speculation,'' he said.   He urged the Congress instead to concentrate on a governmentplan to straighten out the country's economic mess, which was to bepresented later by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.   ``We need drastic reforms,'' Gorbachev said. ``So far, there areno improvements in this area.''   Ryzhkov's deputy, economist Leonid Abalkin, has developed adetailed plan to make the Soviet ruble convertible on worldmarkets, jettison money-losing state-run businesses and fill emptystore shelves.   But Congress also rejected efforts by reformers to discuss keypieces of the economic reform, including proposed laws on propertyownership and land, that came before the Supreme Soviet legislaturethis fall.   Key economic laws have been submitted for public discussion andGorbachev said they could be adopted next spring.   Of more than 2,000 deputies, 1,387 voted against dicussing thelaws on land and property during the session. A total of 537supported it and 68 abstained.   The debate over land and property led to an acrimonious exchangebetween Gorbachev and human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov.   Sakharov has demanded an end to the Communist Party's monopolyon power. He urged a two-hour general strike Monday to show supportfor the idea, but the strike fizzled.   Sakharov urged the deputies to debate ``all the articleshindering the passing of laws on land, property and other billspromoting perestroika.''   When he began to speak about Article 6, Gorbachev cut him shortwith a curt ``thank you.'' ``Who is to define what articles toexclude?'' he asked.   Sakharov then handed Gorbachev a stack of telegrams in supportof his position.   ``You come to me, I will give you three files of telegrams,''Gorbachev retorted.   The Inter-Regional Group, which claims about 400 deputies asmembers, decided over the weekend not to endorse the strike.Members said they didn't want to provoke a public already grumblingover economic hardship.   Instead, the deputies called on Soviets to use meetings,demonstrations, letters and telegrams to the Congress and ``othermeans'' to demand that Article 6 and other the key reform laws beput on the agenda.   Behind closed doors, progressives also agreed on tactics toforce discussion of their agenda. ``I cannot reveal information toyou on the tactics,'' an Inter-Regional Group activist said Mondaynight. ``That was the purpose of the closed session: so theinformation wouldn't leak. You will see the tactics tomorrow duringthe live broadcast.''   Televised live to the nation, the inaugural session of Congressthis summer gave voice to a litany of Soviet woes as some deputiesdenounced _ and others defended _ the KGB, seven decades ofCommunist rule and the crimes of Josef Stalin.   Perhaps chastened, officials have decided to broadcast only theopening proceedings of the winter session live. Deputies themselveswill debate how much of the rest to show the country.</TEXT></DOC>
