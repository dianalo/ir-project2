Ball, Prudential Securities Inc. is a more stableand profitable place, thanks to the powerful stock-marketrally.   But the nation's fourth-largest brokerage company, with5,300 brokers, still is searching for a suitable role on WallStreet and a fruitful relationship with its giant parent,Prudential Insurance Co. of America.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Our history has always been very up and down,&quot; saidHardwick Simmons, Prudential Securities' 51-year-oldpresident and chief executive, in his first interview sincetaking over in May. Mr. Simmons said of the company's recentsuccess: &quot;What we have to prove to ourselves and tocompetitors is that it wasn't just a flash in the pan. . . .We don't want to crow about anything&quot; yet.   But even as it tries to carve out a new identity,Prudential Securities seems to be revisiting some of theareas that led to big losses in the 1980s and contributed toMr. Ball's ouster. The company already is talking aboutpossibly selling limited partnerships again, despite a raftof investor lawsuits triggered by its past plunge intomarketing real estate and other partnerships.   And after retreating from investment banking in late 1990,following Mr. Ball's ill-fated plunge in the area, PrudentialSecurities now is looking to beef up its investment bankingoperations; it plans to increase its current staff of 70investment bankers about 40% in the next two to three years.   Mr. Simmons has tried to assure Prudential Securities'work force that there aren't other shoes to drop. &quot;What wereally wanted to do in '91 -- and thank God, the gods allowed-- is really to clean ourselves up so we can begin in '92 . .. on the same footing as our competitors.&quot;   The true test will come when the stock market slips. SaysGeorge McGough, a former top Prudential Securities executiveand current chairman of Sutro andamp; Co., a small San Franciscobroker: &quot;Good market volume makes us all look good, but we'llfind out in tough times whether there's been a turnaround&quot; atPrudential Securities.   At least the red ink has stopped. After incurring a $259million loss in 1990, Prudential Securities posted 1991record profits of $201 million -- far outpacing its previoushigh of $111 million, set in 1988. Last year's performancewas buoyed by the surging stock market.   Prudential Securities' profits would have been even moresubstantial if not for more than $150 million in reserves thecompany took last year for some missteps when it did businessas Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.; these included legalcosts from lawsuits involving soured partnerships andexpenses from getting out of the Canadian brokerage business,risk arbitrage and merchant banking. In 1992, PrudentialSecurities said it hopes to earn $125 million after taking anestimated $50 million in additional reserves.   One goal that continues to elude Prudential Securities isgenerating the synergy it has long hoped for in sellingfinancial products with its parent Prudential Insurance. Thebig mutual insurer bought the brokerage company in 1981hoping to create a financial supermarket in which bothcompanies would sell each other's products, from insurancepolicies to stocks and bonds.   Even though Prudential Insurance manages $39 billion infunds for Prudential Securities customers, its insuranceagents referred a relatively puny $25 million in tradingcommissions to the brokerage company last year.   One of the biggest hurdles facing Prudential Securities isits size. It isn't big enough to compete on the same levelas, say, giant Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., the nation's biggestbrokerage company with more than 10,000 brokers. As a result,Prudential Securities hopes to snare underwriting and otherbusiness from &quot;middle-market,&quot; or midsized, corporations.   Mr. Simmons emphasized that Prudential Securities has noambitions to become an investment-banking force; investmentbanking generates less than 10% of the company's revenue.Rather, Mr. Simmons said Prudential Securities wants to&quot;refocus&quot; its investment-banking operations on middle-marketcompanies to support Prudential's big broker network. &quot;Onething I've learned is that you can't be a great distributorwithout a great factory beneath you&quot; to create stock and bondofferings to sell to investors, he said.   Prudential Securities has a ways to go. It ranked No. 10in underwriting fees last year, earning just $102.3 million,according to IDD Information Services. Still, &quot;our mostimportant job is to consistently create high-quality product&quot;for the firm's sales force, said Howard A. &quot;Woody&quot; Knight, anold friend of Mr. Simmons who was hired last year to directPrudential Securities' corporate strategy.   One form of those &quot;home-cooked&quot; products could soon belimited partnerships, though the company hasn't yet sold anynew ones. &quot;I think the partnership, per se, will come back,&quot;Mr. Simmons said. &quot;There may be real estate and other areasthat should be structured and sold as partnerships,&quot; he said,&quot;but the structure will be vastly different.&quot;   Mr. Simmons, a veteran brokerage executive who ranShearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s brokerage network in the1980s, has taken pains to craft a new team in a bid to cutties to past management, particularly Mr. Ball. Besideshiring Mr. Knight, Mr. Simmons brought over brokerage veteranGeorge Murray from Shearson to run Prudential Securities'brokerage operations.   The outspoken Mr. Ball was known on Wall Street for hisquirky ways; he inundated his troops with endless memos on awide range of topics. Mr. Simmons, on the other hand, hasbeen much more measured with Prudential Securities brokers,and has taken pains to keep a low profile with the media inthe past year.   Mr. Ball, who is currently a consultant for the J.andamp; W.Seligman andamp; Co. money management company, won't discuss hisformer employer, other than to say: &quot;Wick is an effectiveexecutive and is executing the firm's game plan well.&quot;   Even with the company's success, it remains to be seen howwell the new team will work together. &quot;Turf wars&quot; continue torage between some departments and there is open discord atthe operating committee levels, said some PrudentialSecurities employees.   Nevertheless, Prudential Securities executives remainupbeat that the company is on course again. &quot;We'd be totallymyopic to believe our restructuring was the sole contributorto profitability; much of it is simply markets,&quot; said ArthurH. Burton Jr., a Prudential Securities vice chairman.   &quot;On the other hand, I'd like to think the restructuringhas put us in the position so when the markets go south,we'll still make money,&quot; Mr. Burton said.</TEXT></DOC>
