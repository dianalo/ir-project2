SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new type of laboratory mouse broke legalground Tuesday as the federal government granted Harvard Universitythe first U.S. patent on an animal.   ``A few minutes ago we issued a patent which, for the first timein the history of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, covers ananimal,'' Patent Commissioner Donald J. Quigg announced shortlyafter noon.   ``This particular animal (is) a mouse which has been geneticallyengineered so as to make it more susceptible to'' cancer, Quiggsaid.   The patent, No. 4,736,866, named Philip Leder of Chestnut Hill,Mass., and Timothy A. Stewart of San Francisco as inventors of themouse, which is to be used for research into cancer.   Patents on forms of life are not new, with both plants and typesof bacteria having been patented in the past.   Almost any type of animal _ except humans _ could be consideredfor a patent, Quigg said.   The Patent Office said last year that it was considering patentson animals, following an appellate court ruling in a case involvinga new type of oyster.   That ruling said that the agency could go beyond the plants andbacteria, to which it had previously limited patents on life forms.The oyster patent was never issued, however, with examinersconcluding that the process was not original enough.   The only other animal case occurred in 1974, when the PatentOffice refused to patent a dwarf chicken.   The question of patenting animals has raised some controversy inrecent years, however, with opponents questioning the ethics ofchanging animals.   Bills have been introduced in Congress to place a moratorium onsuch patents until the ethical problems can be worked out, andQuigg said that Congress and the scientific laboratory are theproper forum for such debates.   The patent application for the mouse, which had been pendingsince June 22, 1984, met the legal requirements for a patent, andso one was issued, he said.   There are 21 more animal patent applications pending for theagency, Quigg added. Federal law requires that the subject ofapplications be kept secret until a patent is issued, he said.   However, Quigg said further animal patents are not expected toissue for ``some months.''   According to the mouse patent, a cancer-susceptible gene isintroduced to the mouse embryo when it is first formed, at thestage of one or two cells.   The genetic material used to change the mice is spliced togetherfrom an activated version of the mouse cancer gene and a virus thatcauses mammary tumors in mice, explained Harvard spokeswomanLillian Blacker.   Having mice that are more sensitive to cancer can be a majorbenefit for researchers, Quigg said.   Currently, mice are often exposed to massive doses of chemicalsto see if cancer results. The altered mice could be exposed tochemical levels more like those encountered by humans, perhapsmaking the experiments more easily related to human dangers, Quiggsaid.   The mice have been used in research since 1984 at Harvard,Blacker said, with the introduced traits remaining true throughseveral generations.   The sensitive mice can be used both to test the causes of cancerand cancer-fighting agents, Blacker and Quigg both said.   The Patent Office announcement drew prompt reaction on bothsides of the issue.   Jeremy Rifkin of the Foundation on Economic Trends termed theaction an ``arrogant abuse of power'' by the Patent Office. Rifkin,who has opposed genetic engineering, said a coalition of groupswill seek to get Congress to overturn the action.   Rifkin also raised the possibility that an engineered mousecould escape and breed with wild mice, perhaps posing a danger tothe environment.   But the Industrial Biotechnology Association hailed the actionfor providing researchers a new tool for cancer research.   Legally, a patent holder has the right to exclusive use of aninvention for 17 years. In practice, most patent holders licensetheir developments to others, collecting a fee. The idea is toencourage invention by protecting the rights of individuals whoproduce something new.</TEXT></DOC>
