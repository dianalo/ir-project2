<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-19-1109 </DOCNO><TEXT>An analysis of the evolution of the oil security problems of import-dependentindustrialized countries and of the rise and recent erosion of the marketpower of the major oil exporting countries, particularly those locatedin the Persian Gulf area. The counterproductive reaction of the UnitedStates and other large oil importers to the resulting oil supply andprice instability, especially since the 1973-74 oil embargo, is critiqued.In addition, the synergism between the early commercialization of crudeoil production and refining in the United States and the developmentof the automobile industry is discussed, and the long-term outlook foroil-base transportation fuels is assessed. OPEC's role in destabilizingthe world oil market during the 1970s and its current efforts to restabilizeit are evaluated, as is the likely future course of world oil pricesand of U.S. and other non-OPEC production. An important finding of thisstudy is that the share of oil in the world energy mix has peaked andwill continue its downward trend and that recurring expectations fora sharp escalation of world oil prices and shortages are based on erroneousassessments of the fundamentals governing the oil business.</TEXT></DOC>
