Gen. Augusto Pinochet still sits in the Moneda Palace. His cabinet is the same. The changing of the guard, at 10 every morning, is as punctual as always. In Santiago's busy center, the same street clowns draw crowds in the unrelenting spring sun. The nights are punctuated, still, by distant sirens. The tumult of the past week, when Chile voted against its 15-year dictatorship, has quickly subsided into the humdrum.    &quot;I just can't believe it has happened,&quot; says a Citibank employee. &quot;At times it seems like a dream and I might wake up up and find it isn't true.&quot;    &quot;No,&quot; says her friend, a human rights lawyer. &quot;What happened in the past 15 years was a nightmare. That was the dream. That's what you're waking from.&quot;    ---   Chileans are disoriented. Something of immense importance has happened and they aren't sure what to make of it. By casting ballots, they transformed an all-powerful dictator with ambitions to rule until the end of the century into a defeated general. Now what?    The disorientation is acute in the opposition. Long divided, 16 opposition parties united behind the banner of ousting Gen. Pinochet. But, after their victory, he is still in the palace -- and the 1980 constitution drafted by the military allows him to stay there until March 1990. The opposition is torn between its desire to advance this date and awareness that rushing things could provoke the regime.    Its conflicts are illustrated by an argument between Jorge Schaulsohn and Sergio Bitar, respectively secretary-general and political director of the center-left PPD, a major opposition party. &quot;We have held up the promised land and we aren't delivering,&quot; says Mr. Schaulsohn. &quot;We said we'd get rid of Pinochet and that hasn't happened. If we don't soon deliver facts, our constituency will become more extremist. That could be explosive.&quot;    But Mr. Bitar isn't worried. &quot;The fact is that Pinochet is going,&quot; he says. &quot;Everyone is starting to think of the country without him. They are jockeying for position. Increasingly he will be the leper nobody wants to touch.&quot;    For the moment, nobody, except the Communists, has called for Gen. Pinochet's immediate departure. The idea is to let the regime devour itself.    ---   Few people want to take to the streets. Chileans have mobilized before, only to be quashed by a military machine. After 15 years, one more doesn't seem so much.    Rather, they are digesting what happened. After the fervor of a campaign in which the regime portrayed the poll as a choice between itself and Marxist chaos, there was a hushed solemnity and respect during the Oct. 5 voting. Not a voice was raised, not a badge worn nor banner carried, as people waited in long lines to put a pencil mark on a piece of paper.    After a decade and a half of the culture of conflict, in which the junta projected the image of an extremist nation, this was the moment in which Chile rediscovered its civility and moderation. It was also the day that confirmed the deeply embedded democratic culture that prevailed before the 1973 military coup that ousted the elected government of Marxist Salvador Allende.    But getting over the regime's bellicose culture will take time. For some it has been politically expedient. For others, it has made it easier to make money by denying basic rights to an underclass unable to organize or express itself.    Yet the dignity of Oct. 5 suggests that Chile can be a democratic nation and preserve its economic gains. Extremists are a minority. Though disappointed, there hasn't been any panic among entrepreneurs, who see a strong chance for a center-right government to emerge under a Christian Democrat president. The stock market is steady.    After all, the plebiscite obligates Gen. Pinochet to hold open presidential elections by the end of next year, and the left, by any estimate, doesn't have the absolute majority needed to win. That majority will be found in the center.    ---   The only mass celebration came two days after the vote. &quot;We flushed him with a pencil,&quot; people chanted. Or &quot;Let him go to Paraguay on a bicycle&quot; (Gen. Pinochet owns property in dictatorial Paraguay and had promised bicycles to his supporters during the campaign.) Some mocked, &quot;He ran alone and he came in second.&quot;    There were hundreds of thousands of people. The sun shone, music played. Disaster loomed at times as people pushed toward the stage, threatening to crush those at the front. It will be some time before people stop seeing the police as enemies. So there weren't any police to control the crowd.    ---   The disorientation has been strongest in the regime itself, whose members never considered defeat. Had they asked the street vendors of &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; badges which was selling best, they would have known the opposition was doing well.    Gen. Pinochet was told that women would vote to allow him to stay in office. Small-town mayors assured him he had massive support. A thousand small threats and favors were handed out. Defeat was impossible.    But when it came, the general reportedly raged. He blamed everyone, especially the clowning of junta member and navy commander Adm. Jose Merino, who had called the opposition &quot;humanoids&quot; and a &quot;No&quot; ballot a vote for Satan. He failed to find a new cabinet, and named the same ministers with a mission to dig in.    This week, mutual recrimination and dissent has become apparent. Adm. Merino himself has confirmed that the constitution bars Gen. Pinochet from running in next year's presidential race. Interior Minister Sergio Fernandez's far-right Independent Democratic Union party has urged the general to start cooperating in the choice of a civilian right-wing candidate.    The two other main right-wing parties are disassociating themselves from the regime. The deputy head of the military police, a strong Pinochet supporter, resigned. And air force commander Gen. Fernando Matthei, another junta member, says the time is near for talks with the opposition on constitutional reform.    Meanwhile, the armed forces, says military expert Raul Sohr, aren't ready to support any provocations by Gen. Pinochet. The navy, air force and military police have all accepted the vote as a signal to return to the barracks; the army can't move alone.    As economist Particio Meller remarked in the daily La Epoca: &quot;It is the beginning of the end of the dictatorship. The countdown has begun. It could be a few months more, or a few months less, but there is no doubt that this system {of military rule} is coming to its end.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
