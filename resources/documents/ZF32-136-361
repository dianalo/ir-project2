(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Mary MannandM;&quot;We used to think that bigger meant better and faster machines, but now we'regetting used to smaller, stronger and faster machines,&quot; said John Brown,manager of market research at Moen Inc., a faucet and sink manufacturer inElyria, Ohio.andP;  Brown totes a 7.5-pound Compaq Computer Corp.andP;  LTE 386s/20.andM;While the speed and power of 20MHz 386SX-based notebook-sized laptops areinvaluable traveling assets, they do not replace the comforts of desktop PCs,according to many buyers.andP;  Low battery life, limited keyboard size and screenquality are the biggest drawbacks.andP;  &quot;I thought the battery performance wasdisappointing,&quot; said Peter Moseley of his Tandon Computer Corp.andP;  NB/386SX.andO;Moseley, executive vice president of Platte Valley Mortgage Corp. inScottsbluff, Neb., added, &quot;I get about an hour and 45 minutes of batterylife, which is suitable for a plane trip, but I lose hard-disk speed whenusing the batteries.&quot;andM;&quot;If you don't have a battery lineup when traveling andlsqb;with a notebook laptopandrsqb;,you're better off buying a Sports Illustrated,&quot; said Jim Metzler, a CPA andpartner at Gaines, Emhof, Metzler andamp; Kriner, a Buffalo, N.Y., accounting firm.andO;The company is currently field testing Texas Instruments Inc.'s (TI's)TravelMate 3000 and AST Research Inc.'s Premium Exec 386SX/20 for AccountingToday, a biweekly publication.andM;&quot;Some andlsqb;vendorsandrsqb; say you can get three hours of battery life -- well, forgetthat,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;After an hour and 10 minutes, the AST began running out ofgas.andP;  The TI lasted for an hour and 20 minutes.&quot;andM;During PC Week Labs testing, however, the AST unit outperformed the TI modelin battery tests (see chart, Page 84).andP;  The Premium Exec's average batterylife was two hours and 39 minutes, while the TravelMate lasted only one hourand 40 minutes.andM;Nevertheless, when the field-test period ends, Metzler plans to purchase theTravelMate 3000.andP;  Its screen quality and numeric keypad overshadowed thefeatures of the AST Premium Exec 386SX/20, he said.andM;Gary Cooper, vice president of marketing at Fourth Dimension Control ProductsInc., a Costa Mesa, Calif., developer of software for IBM mainframes, said hechose Everex Systems Inc.'s Tempo LX/20 over AST's Premium Exec 386SX/20 forthe same reasons: The Everex screen and keyboard quality edged out that ofthe Premium Exec.andM;&quot;The Everex screen was easier to read and an inch bigger than AST's,&quot; saidCooper.andP;  &quot;Our representatives use notebooks about two weeks out of a month todemonstrate software, so we were concerned about the screen quality.&quot;andM;Cooper added that the Tempo LX/20 offers a keyboard resembling a full-sizedPC keyboard.andP;  &quot;If andlsqb;the salespeopleandrsqb; aren't used to the keyboard, then thedemo may not go as smoothly.andP;  We don't want to add any additional grief tothe demo.&quot;andM;Battery life and the quality of the screen and keyboard aside, all of the20MHz 386SX-based units seem to fit buyers' needs for size and power.andM;&quot;For us, speed is of the essence,&quot; said Michael Williams, manager of networksand telecommunications at Brobeck, Phleger andamp; Harrison, a San Francisco lawfirm.andP;  Williams purchased several of AST's Premium Exec 386SX/20 notebooks.andM;&quot;We are getting the same speed, features and quality that the major notebookmanufacturers offer,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The AST notebook costs 30 to 40 percent lessthan the IBM notebook.andM;&quot;During a witness' testimony, our legal assistant uses the notebook to searchfor information that will substantiate or refute the testimony.&quot;andM;The 20MHz processing speed of the 386SX also closes the distance betweendesktop and notebook PCs, by letting software applications run equally faston both platforms, said William McPeak, information-systems services managerfor a West Coast aerospace manufacturer.andP;  &quot;The andlsqb;Micro Express NB5620andrsqb;, with2M bytes of RAM, is powerful enough to run our Windows-based applications,&quot;he added.andM;McPeak easily justified his purchase of the NB5620 because of its processingspeed and its $2,000 price tag.andM;Other buyers have switched from one manufacturer to another based on theoverall reliability of the product.andP;  For example, Stone andamp; Webster EngineeringInc., an engineering and construction firm in Houston, is packing up its IBMmachines and switching to Dell Computer Corp.andP;  System 320N notebook-sizedPCs.andM;&quot;We used to be an IBM shop, and we hated them because they always brokedown,&quot; said Jerry Thomas, a senior consultant at Stone andamp; Webster.andP;  &quot;So we'renow phasing out the IBMs and going to all Dells.andP;  We even convinced our NewYork office to switch to Dell andlsqb;System 320Nsandrsqb;.&quot;andM;The biggest factor differentiating desktop PCs from laptops is color.andP;  &quot;Iwould never consider this to be my only PC,&quot; said Metzler.andP;  &quot;When I come backto my desktop PC, it's the most beautiful thing to see the color monitor.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
