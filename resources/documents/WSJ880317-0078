New estimates place total production by the 13 exporters at less than 17 million barrels a day. That's well within the quotas OPEC has set for members and is sharply below February output estimated at 17.4 million to 17.8 million barrels a day.    Although the production decline may be only temporary, it puts output in line with expected requirements for OPEC oil in this year's first half. And it comes in the wake of surprisingly high demand for petroleum, particularly in the U.S.    As a result, it is certain to contribute to the view of some in the industry that oil prices may have reached bottom after falling as much as $4 a barrel since December. &quot;We have seen the lows for at least the next couple months,&quot; said one U.S. crude-oil trader.    There's little evidence yet of any real turn-around in oil prices, which generally are between $14 and $15 a barrel. But the production drop may resolve another dilemma in OPEC -- whether a special meeting is necessary to cut output to prop up prices.    Venezuela last week urged such a step, or at the very least a meeting of OPEC's five-member price-monitoring committee. Since then, however, some of the other members of the committee, including Saudi Arabia and Nigeria, have suggested that neither a meeting nor further cuts in OPEC's production quotas is necessary.    The latest figures underscore the Saudi-Nigerian position. According to Petro-Logistics Ltd., a Geneva consulting firm that closely follows OPEC output, total production in recent days has been only about 16.8 million barrels a day. But the bulk of the drop was accounted for by only three countries, Saudi Arabia and the warring nations of Iran and Iraq.    Conrad Gerber, president of Petro-Logistics, said the major part of the decline was in Saudi Arabia. For the first week of March, he said, the kingdom's production averaged only 3.9 million barrels a day, some 400,000 barrels a day under the Saudi OPEC quota and down 1.2 million barrels a day from the preceding week.    But Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, repeatedly has made clear that Saudi Arabia wouldn't return to its former role of swing producer in OPEC. And the kingdom is known to be making efforts to get its production back up to its OPEC quota of 4.3 million barrels a day. Yesterday a source close to the Saudis said the kingdom still expects output for the entire month of March to be close to the quota.    Saudi Arabia is moving considerable amounts of its production -- about 200,000 barrels a day -- into storage in Europe and in the Caribbean, however. Previously, the Saudis have indicated they expected the storage program to be completed by the end of March. </TEXT></DOC>
