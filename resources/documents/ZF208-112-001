Elton, a military assistant for communicationsand computer systems in the office of the secretary of the Air Force at thePentagon, said the open systems approach has helped the Air Force withacquisitions.andM;Speaking at the UNIX Expo trade show here, Elton cited the AFCAC procurement.andO;&quot;What we've found so far is that, if we adopt an open systems approach andstick with that theme, we'll have much more success,&quot; he said.andM;ATandamp;T and UNIX International emphasized the portability, scalability,interoperability and compatibility the new UNIX release offers customers.andM;Security was not a major feature in the new release, Muldoon said.andP;  ATandamp;Toffers a multilevel secure operating system based on UNIX System V Release 3.andO;The National Computer Security Center has given it a B2 security rating.andM;ATandamp;T will be offering a &quot;security release&quot; of UNIX System V Release 4 thatwill be targeted at the B1 security level.andP;  This will be available in 1990,Muldoon said.andM;The company already has plans to add enhanced multiprocessing capabilities inthe next release of the operating system, UNIX System V Release 4.1.andM;ATandamp;T will be offering application binary interfaces (ABI) for UNIX System VRelease 4.0.andP;  An ABI defines a set of interfaces that makes compiled softwareportable in binary form across different vendors' systems that share aprocessor architecture.andM;Software developers and system providers can use an ABI to develop&quot;shrink-wrap&quot; applications for systems based on the same architecture.andP;  UNIXSystem V Release 4.0 ABIs for the ATandamp;T WE32000, Intel 80386 and 486, Inteli860, SPARC and Motorola 68000 and 88000 microprocessors will be available inthe first quarter of 1990, ATandamp;T officials said.andM;The new UNIX system release also includes user interface enhancements such asthe X Window System Version 11 Release 3, X11/NeWS and support for ATandamp;T's andSun Microsystems Inc.'s Open Look graphical user interface.andM;UNIX System V Release 4.0 incorporates a third-generation memory managementarchitecture based on the virtual memory architecture previously provided inthe SunOS operating system, ATandamp;T officials said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
