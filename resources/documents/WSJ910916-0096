Under Japanese law, Japan Aviation Electronics IndustryLtd., or JAEI, could be banned from exporting its productsfor three years if recent allegations that it repaired andshipped sensitive weapons parts to Iran are proven. The salesallegedly broke U.S. laws as well as Japan's prohibition ofmilitary exports.</LP><TEXT>   But rather than supporting a get-tough stance by Tokyo onexport controls, the Pentagon is alarmed about the effects ofsuch a step -- which could come soon -- on U.S. aerospacecompanies dependent on JAEI supplies. U.S. governmentrepresentatives &quot;have expressed their concern to us,&quot; aJapanese government official said last week.In addition,Honeywell Inc.'s Japan office has asked Japanese bureaucratsto &quot;please consider the impact {on Honeywell} in yourdecision,&quot; said Hiroshi Yamashita, a Honeywell executive. &quot;Wedidn't do anything wrong and we shouldn't suffer fromsanctions,&quot; said Mr. Yamashita, whose company depends on JAEIfor special liquid-crystal displays used in Honeywell flightsystems. &quot;There are many, many innocent customers.&quot;   JAEI, 50.2%-owned by NEC Corp., is also the main supplierof certain navigation systems for the FSX, the high-profilenext-generation jet fighter being co-developed by the U.S.and Japan. In addition to an export ban, the Japanesegovernment also must consider barring the company frommilitary sales in Japan, where the FSX is being built. AJapan Defense Agency spokesman acknowledged that such a movewould &quot;to some extent&quot; hamper the FSX project.   The awkward American position, many U.S. governmentofficials say, is a jolting reminder of increasing dependenceon foreign companies for critical electronic parts, and ofthe effect that can have on policies.   A Commerce Department study found that as much as 20% ofthe parts for three major weapons systems came from foreignsuppliers. And this finding is based on the 1988 purchases ofU.S. contractors; the department believes more recentpurchases may show an even higher degree of dependency. Aseparate study by the Institute of Defense Analysis, aWashington research group, reached similar conclusions.   The affair became public in July, when JAEI executivesadmitted that the company had repaired and sold missile partsfor Iran during its lengthy war with Iraq in the 1980s.Japanese officials immediately vowed to pursue the casevigorously, and on Friday formally indicted four topexecutives. The four -- Chairman Motoo Hirota; senior adviserYukio Kaita, who earlier had resigned as president; seniormanaging director Keiichi Fukuizumi; and director YoshiharuFukunaga -- resigned Friday to take responsibility for theillegal shipments, JAEI said.   The U.S. Justice Department also has been pursuing a hardline, securing a 22-count grand jury indictment earlier thismonth against JAEI as well as Aero Systems Inc. of Miami. Theindictment said JAEI illegally made and sold equipment forAero Systems, knowing those parts would be shipped to Iranthrough Aero Systems' Hong Kong and Singapore subsidiaries.JAEI acquired the equipment and know-how for the parts fromtwo U.S. companies for use in Japan, but couldn't supply themto other countries without the U.S. State Department'sauthorization.   And while some U.S. government and industry officials areprodding the Japanese government to take a soft line, theJustice Department is considering urging other federalagencies to bar JAEI from purchasing U.S. technology orreceiving contracts from the federal government.   It isn't clear what the full effect on American companieswould be if JAEI is banned from exporting to the U.S. Kyodo,the Japanese news service, quoted JAEI officials as sayingthat, to counter the possible export ban, they wereconsidering producing the special liquid-crystal displays inthe U.S. The news agency said JAEI is contracted to supplyHoneywell in this fiscal year with 1,800 LCD-based parts foruse in devices for avoiding airborne collisions. It said JAEIis the world's only maker of such LCDs.   But that change, too, has its complications. That wouldrequire importing to the U.S. advanced ultra-thin displayscreens from the Japanese company Hosiden Corp. Hosiden,however, stopped shipping the panels to the U.S. last monthafter federal trade authorities decided the company wasunfairly dumping the screens and imposed a special 63% dutyon the products.</TEXT></DOC>
