Seib   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/04/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12</SO><CO>   MDEST</CO><GV>DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF)EXECUTIVE (EXE)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The war with Iraq is entering a crucial newphase in which U.S. planners are looking more closely at thebiggest question of all: How can it be brought to an end?   As allied attacks begin focusing more directly on theIraqi troops occupying Kuwait, administration officials saythey now discount the two most extreme possibilities forending the fighting. They see little chance that SaddamHussein will surrender. At the same time, they say the U.S.doesn't have any intention of launching a military pushthrough Kuwait and on to occupy Baghdad.</LP><TEXT>   Between those two extremes, though, is a wide range ofpossible scenarios for bringing the war to a conclusion.Several of Saddam Hussein's recent actions, for instance,could be signs that he plans to fight on for a time to earnplaudits for his bravery in the Arab world, then turn to sometrusted Arab figure to broker a ceasefire and withdrawal fromKuwait that leaves him in power.   Such a theory is supported by last week's Iraqi groundattacks inside Saudi Arabia, which seemed designed largely toscore political points among the Arab masses. At the sametime, the exodus of nearly 100 Iraqi planes to safety in Iransuggested the Iraqi leader might be saving the cream of hisair force from destruction now so he won't be left militarilyimpotent after the war ends.   Yet there also is evidence indicating that Saddam Husseinintends to fight to the death. For instance, he is believedto have told visitors privately before the war that hisstrategy is to prolong fighting into the summer, when hethinks the combination of heat and casualties will break U.S.will and turn George Bush into the one seeking a ceasefire.   &quot;It's very, very clear that there is no option other thanto fight to the bitter end,&quot; declared Crown Prince Hassan ofJordan on CBS-TV's &quot;Face the Nation.&quot; Jordan has beensympathetic to Iraq and is familiar with Saddam Hussein'sthinking.   Given those uncertainties, analysts inside and outside thegovernment say these are the most logical scenarios forending the war:                                                                                                          Iraqi Collapse in Kuwait                                                                                                          In this scenario, the half-million Iraqi troops in andaround Kuwait begin crumbling because their lines of supplyand communication have been cut by allied bombings and theirdefensive lines have been pierced or flanked by allied groundforces. That would lead to massive retreats or wholesalecapture of Iraqi ground forces, or both.   Administration aides worry that even this rosy scenariospells problems. It could leave what one official calls a&quot;very ambiguous situation&quot; in which Saddam Hussein is out ofKuwait yet still able to launch harassing artillery barragesand Scud missile strikes.   Another problem for President Bush is that his rhetoricmay make it difficult to settle for even a clear militaryvictory in Kuwait. Mr. Bush's highly publicized threats tobring Saddam Hussein to trial for war crimes could make itseem he hasn't succeeded unless he goes further and capturesor eliminates the Iraqi leader.   But administration officials are trying to build an escaperoute from these traps by arguing that if Saddam Husseinsurvives, the U.S. might seek to keep economic sanctions inplace until Iraqi leaders are brought to justice and pay forwar damages. Some senior Arab officials argue that if Iraq isdefeated militarily in Kuwait, President Bush shouldn't evenworry about going after Saddam Hussein because the Iraqileader would be so politically weakened that he soon would bepushed aside from within his own nation.   &quot;I myself find it hard to envisage a situation in which hehas decisively lost the war and survives politically,&quot; saysformer Defense Secretary Harold Brown.                                                                                                          Internal Iraqi Collapse                                                                                                          This is the dream scenario for the U.S. An Iraqi militaryofficer or a group of officers, alarmed at the destruction ofIraq, assassinate Saddam Hussein or oust him in a coup.Alternately, the Iraqi leader dies in a U.S. military strike.The &quot;most explosive&quot; possibility, says Middle East analystWilliam Quandt of the Brookings Institution, is that Israel,angered over Iraqi missile attacks and unencumbered by U.S.laws prohibiting assassinations, launches an operation tokill Saddam Hussein.   In any event, the U.S. hope would be that a new leaderblames the war on Saddam Hussein and withdraws Iraqi troopsfrom Kuwait. The problem is that Saddam Hussein has provedadept at surviving threats from within. And even if he falls,there's no clear leader or group of leaders to replace him.Iraqi dissidents are waiting in exile in Syria and London,but they are a disparate lot of leftists, fundamentalists andfollowers of Saddam Hussein's own Baath Party. Some IraqiShiite Muslim leaders in exile in neighboring Iran areinterested in attempting to assume power back home, but SunniMuslims have traditionally enjoyed the predominant politicalposition in Iraq.                                                                                                          Pullback by Iraq                                                                                                          This is the opening the U.S. and the Soviet Union offeredto Saddam Hussein last week when they issued a jointstatement saying the war could end if Iraq made an&quot;unequivocal commitment&quot; to get out of Kuwait.   Under this scenario, Saddam Hussein might fight on for awhile to prove his valor, then reach out to a friendlyintermediary, such as Algeria, to work with the U.S. and itsallies to arrange a pullback from Kuwait. Saddam Husseinwould give up Kuwait but attempt to stay in power, bargainingthat he will be a hero in the Arab world simply for havingsurvived weeks of pounding by the most powerful armed forcesthe West could muster. He will have sheltered enough of hisair force and army from the war to ensure he maintainsmilitary as well as political punch.   The first signs of diplomatic activity to explore thisoption may be under way now in Iran. Over the weekend,Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani met separately withAlgerian Foreign Minister Ahmed Ghozali and Yemen's Ministerof State for Foreign Affairs, Abdul-Aziz al-Dali. BothAlgeria and Yemen are sympathetic to Iraq and have tried tobroker negotiated solutions. At the same time, an officialfrom France, which is part of the international forcefighting Iraq, also was in Iran, and an envoy from Kuwait'sexiled government also flew to Tehran to meet Mr. Rafsanjani.                                                                                                          U.S. Backs Down                                                                                                          This is the U.S. nightmare scenario. If the U.S. findsthat it can't bring the war to an end swiftly, it may havetrouble maintaining its partnership with moderate Arabsnations, where sympathy for Saddam Hussein likely would grow.   The situation could be made especially messy for PresidentBush if Iraq succeeds in expanding the war. That could happenif it launches a successful chemical-weapons attack atIsrael, prompting a response. In that case, Iran hassuggested it might drop its neutrality by joining the fighton the side of Iraq, another Muslim nation fighting theJewish state. The Iraqi planes now sitting in Iran mightre-enter the fight, and the situation could be so messy thatPresident Bush could be forced to seek a diplomatic way tostop it from spreading further.   But such a bleak outcome doesn't seem likely because allof those wrong turns would have to take place -- and none hasyet occurred. There's no proof Iraq is able to reach Israelwith chemical weapons, Iran regularly restates its neutralityand Israel has remained resolutely on the sidelines.</TEXT></DOC>
