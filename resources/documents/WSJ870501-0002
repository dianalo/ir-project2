Col. Oliver North twice tried to delay a criminal probe involving publicist Richard Miller, who now is implicated in illegal fund-raising efforts for Nicaraguan insurgents.    Col. North told investigators that Mr. Miller was a high-level consultant to the National Security Council and the State Department and that Mr. Miller was used by the Reagan administration both to solicit private aid to the insurgents and to help free American hostages held in Lebanon, according to FBI documents released yesterday by the Senate Intelligence Committee.    Mr. Miller's efforts to raise millions of dollars from a person claiming to be a Saudi Arabian prince, according to summaries of Col. North's interviews with FBI agents, was even &quot;discussed by North personally with President Ronald Reagan&quot; and then-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane sometime in June 1985, the FBI documents said.    The documents also show that, stretching back through 1985 and 1986, Col. North had more extensive contacts with FBI and Justice Department officials about pending criminal investigations than had been previously disclosed.    Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel investigating the Iran-Contra scandal, wants to determine whether some of those contacts may have been improper or were otherwise intended to obstruct or interfere with the FBI's normal handling of criminal cases.    Mr. Walsh, according to sources familiar with his inquiry, also is investigating whether Col. North may have exaggerated Mr. Miller's role in some secret White House initiatives in order to deter FBI agents from delving more deeply into the fund-raising efforts for the Contra insurgents.    On Wednesday, conservative fund-raiser Carl &quot;Spitz&quot; Channell pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the government by funneling tax-exempt donations to arm the Contras, and in court he named Col. North and Mr. Miller as co-conspirators.    The documents were released during a confirmation hearing on FBI Director William Webster's nomination to head the Central Intelligence Agency.    Despite lengthy and sometimes sharp questioning by senators, the committee is expected to approve the nomination overwhelmingly, perhaps as early as today. The full Senate is expected to confirm Mr. Webster soon after that.    The FBI chief acknowledged that some of Col. North's contacts with FBI officials -- which didn't come to light until recently -- were &quot;disturbing,&quot; unusual and clearly outside of routine channels. But after reviewing the material, Mr. Webster told lawmakers: &quot;Col. North had no pipeline into the FBI, and agents of the FBI weren't giving him access to information to which he was not entitled.&quot;    The material released by the committee shows that Col. North used a variety of contacts -- ranging from an assistant U.S. attorney to Oliver &quot;Buck&quot; Revell, one of Mr. Webster's closest aides -- to obtain information, send messages or indicate his interest in criminal investigations.    In April 1986, for example, the documents show that Col. North asked for Mr. Revell's help to persuade a federal prosecutor to delay Mr. Miller's appearance before a grand jury in Philadelphia, which was investigating purported Saudi prince Mousalreza Ebrahaim Zadeh for alleged bank fraud. According to a memo written at the time by the prosecutor, Mr. Revell told him that &quot;high-level officials in the White House and the National Security Council&quot; were relying on Mr. Miller as a &quot;contact&quot; to obtain information that the purported prince &quot;might have on the hostages currently held in Beirut.&quot;    Mr. Zadeh was indicted on fraud charges four months later and subsequently pleaded guilty. Mr. Miller wasn't accused of any wrongdoing in that case, and he has maintained that his fund-raising efforts for the Contras didn't violate any laws. Col. North has declined to answer questions about his role in the Iran-Contra affair.    In early 1985, Col. North called an FBI agent in Los Angeles working on a separate criminal investigation of a group planning to take military action against the Nicaraguan government, according to an FBI document. Col. North, among other things, requested that investigators not mention the name of Adolfo Calero, the head of one of the Contra groups, during the course of their work, &quot;due to the sensitive nature of his association with the U.S. government.&quot; A report about the results of the investigation from the FBI's Miami office was later sent to Col. North by FBI headquarters. </TEXT></DOC>
