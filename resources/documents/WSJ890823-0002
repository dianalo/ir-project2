The colony's biggest bank said that per-share earnings rose to 33 cents from an adjusted 29 cents a year earlier and that the proposed interim dividend was increased to 14 cents a share from 12 cents.    The results were roughly in line with most analysts' forecasts. But the ability of Hong Kong banks to transfer funds to and from undisclosed inner reserves allows them to manipulate profit figures, which are viewed as providing only an indication of an institution's true profitability.    Most of its Asian and Middle East branches had good results. Among North American banking operations, Marine Midland Bank and Hongkong Bank of Canada had better earnings. Hongkong Bank of Australia was hurt by loan provisions. The Wardley Holdings Ltd. merchant bank's results improved. CMandamp;M Group, a New York-based primary dealer in U.S. government securities, returned to profitability. The James Capel brokerage firm, which had a loss last year, posted a small firsthalf operating profit, but had a net loss owing to a cost-cutting reorganization. </TEXT></DOC>
