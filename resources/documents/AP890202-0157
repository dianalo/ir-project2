The Greenpeace ship Gondwana left the whaling fleet Thursday,after giving the Japanese whale-shaped gingerbread cookies with anote, ``If you want to eat whales, eat these,'' according to groupspokesman Paul Bogart.   The Gondwana had been trying to prevent four Japanese ships fromwhaling in the Antarctic Ocean. On Tuesday, the Gondwana collidedwith the Japanese mother ship, the 23,000-ton Nisshin Maru No. 3,but there were no injuries and little damage.   ``I understand Greenpeace is conducting obstructive activitieswhile the research whaling fleet is conducting legal and legitimateactivities,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe saidThursday.   ``As the research ships' activities are in line withInternational Whaling Commission guidelines, those obstructiveactivities are unjustifiable,'' Watanabe told reporters at a weeklynews conference.   Greenpeace said Thursday it had filmed the Japanese whaling fleetwhile it harpooned and electrocuted minke whales. It said it wouldgive the film to the whaling commission.   Bogart, interviewed by radio telephone aboard the Gondwana,called the cookie packages ``a parting gift.''   He said the note attached to the cookies also read: ``We bear noanimosity to the Japanese people or members of the Japanese ships.''   He said one of the Japanese boats relayed a message thankingGreenpeace for the package.   Japan says it plans to take 300 whales this year as part of itsscientific research to determine the size of whale stocks.   Such research is allowed under a moratorium imposed by theInternational Whaling Commission. The regulations are to bereevaluated in 1990 on the basis of the research.   However, Greenpeace contends most of the whale meat taken byJapanese boats will end up in sushi restaurants in Japan.   Japanese whaling and government officials have accused Greenpeaceof engaging in ``terrorist'' tactics and endangering lives. However,Watanabe said Thursday use of that word was ``regrettable.''   Greenpeace said its presence temporarily halted the hunt and drewinternational attention to the plight of whales. The group estimatedthe Japanese had harpooned 55 minke whales.   In Wellington, New Zealand, Greenpeace supporters inblood-spattered overalls on Thursday delivered bags of imitationwhale meat to the Japanese Embassy and cultural center to protestthe whale kill.   Greenpeace said Thursday its ship was headed toward a U.S. baseon Antarctica's McMurdo Sound. The group says that area has beenbadly polluted.</TEXT></DOC>
