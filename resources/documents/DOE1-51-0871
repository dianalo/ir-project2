In order to provide such an engineeringapplication environment in this paper a new approach for managing multipleDatabase Windows (DBW) is proposed, which may be considered as an issuein between DDB and multicache management, and augments two major typesof previous approaches, the database program interface which did notsupport distributed management over the check-out environment; and thestatically distributed database (DDB), which did not cover the notionof dynamic data swapping.</TEXT></DOC>
