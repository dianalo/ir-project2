Essex Group Inc.'s domestic operations are being acquired by Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II and a group of Essex executives.    United Technologies wouldn't disclose the amount of the cash transaction. But the aerospace and building systems concern said it expects to receive $475 million from this transaction and the previously reported sale of Essex's much smaller European operations to Von Roll AG, of Gerlafingen, Switzerland.    The domestic operations are the bulk of Essex's business and &quot;a major portion&quot; of the $475 million that United Technologies will realize, a Morgan Stanley spokesman said.    Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II will own the largest share of MS/Essex Holdings Inc., with the cable concern's senior management controlling 10% to 15%, the Morgan Stanley spokesman said, adding that the precise amounts hadn't been determined.    He emphasized that this leveraged buyout won't result in Essex's domestic operations being cut up and sold off. &quot;We are long-term investors,&quot; he said. &quot;We are not in the business of buying and stripping apart.&quot; Plans call for Essex management to remain in charge of the business, he said.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
