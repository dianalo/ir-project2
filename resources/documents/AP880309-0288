Meese spokesman Terry Eastland said the attorney general wouldnot comply because, ``No one should be urged to step down from agovernment position simply because that person is underinvestigation.''   The lawmakers made their request in a letter to Meese, and fiveof them held a news conference to elaborate on their remarks.   Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, one of the signers, deniedthat the signers had a political motive, saying, ``Ed Meese is thebest thing to happen to the Democratic Party.''   Another signer, Rep. Bruce Morrison of Connecticut, said thestandard Meese is setting for ethical conduct is ``not in theslammer.''   Meese has been under criminal investigation by independentcounsel James McKay since last May 11. McKay has been examiningMeese's involvement with scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., and with a$1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project.   McKay also has been examining the attorney general's involvementwith the regional Bell telephone companies at a time when he owned$14,000 in phone stock.   In addition Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, investigatingthe Iran-Contra arms and money affair, has called Meese before agrand jury numerous times.   ``We strongly believe that your increasing inability to spendtime on the day-to-day demands of your job, the deterioratingmorale at the Department of Justice and the continuing cloud overyour office are undermining your ability to act effectively as thenation's chief law enforcement officer,'' the Democrats said in theletter.   The letter said the pending investigations ``detract from thetime required to properly administer the Department of Justice.   ``The pervasive perception that you have allowed personalconsiderations to encroach on your constitutional responsibilitiesthreatens to breed contempt for your office, your administrationand the rule of law itself,'' the lawmakers said.   Eastland responded, ``This is an old idea, a politicallypartisan idea and a thoroughly bad idea.''   He said Meese ``has every intention of serving to the end ofthis term. He has spent some time with his lawyers on theinvestigation, but there has been no serious subtraction of histime or effort from leadership of the Department of Justice.''   Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., told the news conference that thepipeline project may have involved an attempt by a U.S. company _with Meese's knowledge _ to bribe foreign officials. Such bribeswould violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.   ``At this moment, some business groups are conducting a majordrive to weaken the (act),'' Berman said. ``In that effort, theyhave consistently been supported by this administration and by thisJustice Department.''   The letter was signed by Reps. Dan Glickman, Kansas; EdwardFeighan, Ohio; Berman; Frank; Morrison; Lawrence Smith, Florida;Harley Staggers Jr., West Virginia; John Conyers, Michigan; GeorgeCrockett Jr., Michigan; Mike Synar, Oklahoma and PatriciaSchroeder, Colorado.</TEXT></DOC>
