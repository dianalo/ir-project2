The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 3.75 points to2,194.29, its highest point since the October 1987 stock marketcrash.   Bond prices posted healthy gains. The dollar also rose.   Ordinarily a drop in the jobless rate scares the bond marketbecause it raises concerns that the economy is overheating, causinginflation that undermines the value of fixed-income investments.   Inflationary pressures could prompt the Federal Reserve totighten credit by boosting interest rates, something that hurts bothstocks and bonds.   But analysts said the employment gains were expected, and theynoted that average wages remained flat at $9.45 an hour for a thirdmonth. That eased inflation concerns.   The jobless rate averaged 5.5 percent for all of 1988, down from6.2 percent in 1987, the Labor Department said.   ``That gives some support to the notion that we have a strongeconomy but it hasn't set off a new inflationary spiral yet,'' saidCarol Stone, an economist with Nomura Securities International Inc.   December's civilian unemployment rate was down 0.1 percentagepoint from November, hitting 5.3 percent for the third time in 1988,the lowest level since the 5.1 percent of May 1974.   Service-producing industries led in the creation of 279,000 newjobs last month, bringing to nearly 3.8 million the number of jobscreated during the year, the most since 1984's total of 3.95million, the department said.   Economists said inflation remains a threat.   ``It shows that the economy has not shifted to a lower gear,''said economist Roger Brimmer of Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,Mass., forecasting service. ``With the economy continuing to operateat these levels and continuing to grow as rapidly as it is,inflation is going to keep creeping up.''   ``The economy continues to grow robustly and wage rates are notaccelerating very much right now,'' said Washington-based economistMichael K. Evans. ``But I still think there is higher inflationahead, perhaps in spite of this report and not because of it. Wecould get a big jolt in inflation in January.''   When Reagan took office in January 1981, unemployment was 7.5percent. It rose to 10.8 percent late in the 1981-82 recession, thehighest level in four decades, before beginning to decline.   The number of workers employed part-time because they cannot findfull-time work also was unchanged over the past year, remaining at5.3 million.   An alternate jobless rate that includes in the labor force the1.7 million members of the armed forces stationed in the UnitedStates was also 5.3 percent last month, unchanged from November.   The dollar rose sharply for a third straight day as tradersinterpreted comments by a West German official as being bullish forthe U.S. currency.   Helmut Schlesinger, vice president of the Bundesbank, said theWest German central bank had not intervened recently to influenceexchange rates. Dealers took that to mean the bank would not try tolimit the dollar's rise. But the German central bank and the FederalReserve did sell dollars on Friday.   The dollar's rise helped support bond prices.   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond gained 21-32 point,or about $6.50 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, whichmoves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 9.03 percentfrom 9.08 percent on Thursday.</TEXT></DOC>
