Bush took center stage Wednesday at a House Republican newsconference, as he combined his support for the GOP plan with ablistering partisan attack that was cheered by dozens of hissupporters attending the event.   ``I'm sick and tired ... in hearing the Democrats do nothing buttear down and criticize'' the Reagan administration's attempts tohalt drug abuse, Bush said. ``I'm talking about Jesse Jackson andMichael Dukakis the last two months.''   The Republican plan also calls for the death penalty for drugkingpins, and it would require that states suspend the driver'slicense of anyone convicted of using drugs, or face loss of federalhighway funding.   Dukakis, in Framingham, Mass., hit back on the drug issue,criticizing the Reagan administration for permitting Coast Guardbudget cuts that have idled drug interdiction patrols.   ``How can we possibly be serious about fighting a war on drugswhen we're cutting Coast Guard patrols by 55 percent? It's thatkind of thing _ one of the reasons I'm running for thepresidency,'' Dukakis said.   In addition to the vice president, administration officialsappeared all over the Capitol complex Wednesday to testify on thedrug problem. The top Coast Guard officer discussed the cuts in hisagency's drug patrols. The administration's chief budget officialand the defense secretary testified on the need for drug-freeworkplaces.   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci told lawmakers thatAmerica's defense contractors will soon be ordered to provide adrug-free workplace environment for their 3.2 million employees.   The hundreds of defense contractors would be required to developextensive education programs about the dangers of drugs; employeeswith security clearances could also be required to undergomandatory drug testing, Carlucci said.   An estimated 3 million workers on Pentagon contracts havesecurity clearances of various types. Carlucci did not say if thetesting would be required of all employees with clearances or justthose with the more sensitive access clearances.   Carlucci testified before an unusual joint meeting of the Houseand Senate Armed Services Committees.   James C. Miller III, director of the Office of Management andBudget, also said the Reagan administration supports efforts tocreate drug-free workplaces.   But he expressed reservations before a House GovernmentOperations subcommittee about legislation designed to bring aboutthat goal.   A bill sponsored by committee Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas,would require federal contractors and grantees to establishdrug-free workplace policies. Employees would have to observe thepolicies, and sanctions could be imposed if drug use still occurredin the workplace.   The sanctions, which would be applied under due processrequirements, include future disbarment of contractors who arefrequent violators.   Miller said the bill, which in part calls for employers andemployees to certify that they are complying with the law, wouldrequire ``extensive new paperwork burdens.''   Bush, standing with some 50 House Republicans at their newsconference, declared the GOP package ``better than anything theDemocrats are going to dream up.''   Democrats control both houses of Congress, however, and majorityHouse and Senate task forces are at work developing their own drugproposals.   Answering reporters' questions, Bush also said he supports theadministration's ``zero tolerance'' policy of seizing property wheneven a small amount of illegal drugs is found. He said, ``If someyacht owner is inconvenienced, it's too damn bad.''   Adm. Paul A. Yost Jr., commandant of the Coast Guard, told aHouse Merchant Marine subcommittee that his budget shortfall is$103 million. He said the money problem ``is proving to be aserious blow to our operations'' against drug smugglers.   ``There is a great hue and cry from members getting on thebandwagon for new omnibus drug legislation to win the war againstdrugs, and Congress is now considering a package of druglegislation costing $2 billion,'' said Rep. Earl Hutto, D-Fla.,chairman of the panel.   ``I wonder where some of those same people were earlier thisyear when this subcommittee was trying to get Congress to find the$103 million necessary just to keep the Coast Guard ... afloat.''   Yost said last week that the amount of drugs seized by the CoastGuard has been reduced by about one half since the cutbacks.</TEXT></DOC>
