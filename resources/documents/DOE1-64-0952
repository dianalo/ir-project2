Scientificknowledge exists to control any particular emission, to clean up anyparticular dump, and to protect people against any particular route ofexposure. Unfortunately, these actions are generally expensive and timeconsuming, so that all cannot be accomplished simultaneously. The principaluncertainties lie not in the scientific issues but rather in the policyissues, such as setting priorities, determining how clean is clean enough,and how much ought to be spent on keeping chemicals out of the environment.Lave and Upton provide an introduction to these policy issues.</TEXT></DOC>
