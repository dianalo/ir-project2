TransAlta, an electric utility, said it will write down the value of its 35% stake in Canada Northwest Energy Ltd., an oil and gas producer here. TransAlta said the charge is a result of this year's big drop in petroleum prices. It added that it &quot;remains confident that the longer-term prospects for Canada Northwest Energy are positive.&quot;    A TransAlta spokesman said the company still expects to report a profit for the year after taking the charge. In the first nine months, TransAlta's net income rose 2.5% to $193.3 million, or $2.11 a share, from a year earlier. Revenue grew 11% to $688.1 million. </TEXT></DOC>
