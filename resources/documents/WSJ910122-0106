In particular, the administration of Jimmy Carterchampioned the conventional-warhead cruise missile and theStealth fighter, which were instrumental in surprising Iraqon the war's first night with devastating strikes on heavilydefended targets. The Carter administration also first laidplans to defend the moderate Mideast oil states with a RapidDeployment Force -- the predecessor of the Central Command,which is conducting the war.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I must confess a certain personal satisfaction in seeingsome of the weapons and tactics with which I was personallyassociated pay off in the Gulf today,&quot; says Harold Brown, whowas Mr. Carter's defense secretary. &quot;When I hear commentatorssaying that the credit for these weapons goes to the Reaganadministration, I say, `Credit for what? The B-1 bomber andStar Wars?' They're not involved in this war.&quot;   Presidents come and go in Washington, but Pentagon weaponsprograms just roll on, often taking 15 or 20 years frominitial research to deployment. That means manyadministrations -- notably Ronald Reagan's -- can claimpieces of the credit for the hardware in the war. But evensome Reagan-era officials acknowledge a debt to Democraticpredecessors.   &quot;Poor Carter, he never got credit for the stuff he did,&quot;says Lawrence Korb, a senior Pentagon official in the Reaganadministration. &quot;But he and Brown were the main movers onhigh-tech weapons. They were started in the Nixon-Ford era,but it was the Carter people who pushed them very hard. Wejust took these Carter projects and added more money andsupport.&quot;   That added money and support was no little thing,Reaganites note. &quot;Some of these things, like Stealth and thecruise, were pushed under Carter, but the important thingthat we added was support on a consistent basis for a strongdefense,&quot; says Caspar Weinberger, Mr. Reagan's secretary ofdefense. &quot;It's not enough just to build a cruise missile or aStealth fighter. We needed, and we provided, a broadacross-the-board defense capability. I'm really pretty proudof that when I look at the Gulf war today.&quot;   What's more, the Reagan buildup provided the quantities ofweapons, depth of training and spare parts that were in shortsupply when President Carter left office. It's doubtful, forinstance, that President Bush today could have marshaled thesix modern aircraft carriers now in the war if Mr. Carter'sfaint support for carriers had continued.   Even former Secretary Brown concedes, &quot;When it comes tothe size of the force and putting the money in to buy theweapons and train the force, the Reagan administrationdeserves credit.&quot;   And the Patriot missile, which has been dazzling inknocking down Iraqi Scud missiles, is Mr. Reagan's baby, notMr. Carter's. The Patriot limped along with technicalglitches during the Carter years, and didn't really get goinguntil the Reagan era, when it was brought on line in quantityand given the capability to attack incoming missiles as wellas attacking planes.   Still, the initial stage of the war owes a lot to JimmyCarter. &quot;We're fighting the war the way Carter and Brownwould have wanted it -- high on technology and low onmanpower costs,&quot; says Mr. Korb.   The cruise missile was so important to President Carterthat he took a high-risk political gamble with it. In June1977, he stunned Washington by canceling the planned B-1nuclear-weapon bomber on the ground that cruise missilesfired from land, air or sea could better deliver nuclearweapons and carry conventional warheads as well.   Mr. Brown immediately sought to nearly double the budgetfor the Tomahawk. He pushed work on the conventionalland-attack variant and on the sophisticated terrain-matchingtelevision guidance system that steers the missile to itstarget.   Conservative Republicans and air-power stalwarts bitterlyattacked the choice of cruise missiles over the mannedbomber, and Ronald Reagan made it a symbol of Carter defenseweakness in the 1980 presidential campaign. After Mr. Reagantook office, he restored the B-1 and built a fleet of them,while continuing the cruise-missile programs as well.   While the Tomahawk has chalked up a 98% success rate inthe war, according to the Pentagon, the B-1 is still backhome. Officially, that's because it carries only heavynuclear weapons, which aren't being used in the war. But ithas also been plagued with electronics problems that mightraise doubts about its reliability even if it carriedconventional munitions.   The Stealth aircraft was another Carter project thatbecame a bone of contention with Mr. Reagan. In August 1980,in the midst of Mr. Carter's re-election campaign against Mr.Reagan, Secretary Brown announced that the U.S. had secretlydeveloped a &quot;Stealth&quot; technology that would permit U.S. jetsto remain invisible to enemy radar until it was too late tostop them. Some Republican defense experts at the timecontended the Stealth capabilities were being exaggerated.   Mr. Brown's disclosure focused on the huge Stealth bomber,now known as the B-2, of which only one exists. He also saidthe Pentagon was studying using the technology in smallerfighters. But what he didn't disclose -- and what didn'tbecome known for years -- was that the Stealth fighter nowbeing used in the war began limited production in 1978.   &quot;I think Harold deserves a lot of credit, especially forpushing the Stealth,&quot; says James Schlesinger, defensesecretary under President Ford, who was himself involved inthe earlier research stages of the high-tech weapons.   Despite the Carterite origins of some of the key weapons,Reaganites argue that their success validates GOP defensepolicies. For instance, they say, the Patriot's ability toshoot down Scud missiles shows that the Strategic DefenseInitiative, for knocking out higher-flying enemy missiles, isworthwhile. They also complain that Mr. Carter agreed tolimit some cruise missiles under arms-control agreements, andthey note that the Democratic Congress tried to kill thePatriot (though then-House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill lobbiedfor the Massachusetts-made weapon).   The Carter administration imprint on the war isn't limitedto weapons. The basic idea that the U.S. would rush to defendmoderate Mideast states from attack was outlined in theCarter Doctrine, espoused in 1980. And the plans for gettingthe troops there in a hurry were put in place by SecretaryBrown the year before, when he launched the Rapid DeploymentForce, a multiservice organization that Mr. Weinberger latertransformed into the Central Command.   In the late 1970s, when the shah of Iran was falling andit was feared that Saudi Arabia might be at risk from Iran oreven the Soviet Union, Mr. Brown toured the region andpledged military aid to Saudi Arabia and others. Thefollowing January, in his State of the Union speech, Mr.Carter declared: &quot;An attempt by any outside force to gaincontrol of the Gulf region will be regarded as an assault onthe vital interests of the U.S. Such an assault will berepelled by use of any means necessary, including militaryforce.&quot; (Mr. Reagan later extended the doctrine to coverthreats from within the Gulf region.)   It was also the Carter Pentagon that began securing suchbases as Diego Garcia for pre-positioning equipment so forcescould be rushed quickly to the Mideast. And it was the Carteradministration that, in 1980, rushed Awacs radar airplanes toSaudi Arabia to protect the kingdom from any spillover of theIran-Iraq war. But back then, the planes were there to peereastward, into Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
