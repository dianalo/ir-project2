Diplomatic sources cited moves by the Palestine LiberationOrganization as the reason it is no longer certain the talks, to behosted by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, will be held.   Still, Israeli cabinet secretary Eliakim Rubinstein, who playeda leading role in negotiations that led to the 1979Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, was sent here Sunday from Jerusalem.   He is meeting at the State Department with Dennis Ross, head ofthe State Department's policy planning staff and Baker's closestadviser on the Middle East, and with Richard Haass and otherNational Security Council staffers.   Ross broke away from Baker's trip to Europe last week to preparefor the meeting with Rubinstein.   Egypt, meanwhile, is sending no special representative fromCairo to make preparations. Ambassador Sayed el Reedy is available,as needed.   The three-way talks Baker hopes to have with Foreign MinistersMoshe Arens of Israel and Esmat Abdel Meguid of Egypt would be thefirst step toward Palestinian elections on the Israeli-held WestBank and in Gaza.   Both Israel and Egypt have agreed to the meeting, reserving someissues to be settled once Arad and Meguid saw Baker.   But since the State Department announced Egypt's qualifiedacceptance 12 days ago, problems have arisen between the Arabcountry and the PLO. They raise questions whether Egypt would bespeaking for Yasser Arafat's organization.   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir assured President Bush andBaker on a visit here in mid-November that he was committed to hisplan for elections among the 1.4 million Palestinian Arabs in theterritories.   The idea is to choose negotiators to work out limited self-rulewith Israel, a plan that has the support of the Bush administrationbut is challenged by the PLO as a ploy to prevent establishment ofa Palestinian state.   When Egypt agreed to Baker's proposal for a planning meetinghere in January it registered some reservations, as Israel had doneearlier. They were to be taken up at the meeting.   Essentially, Egypt reserved the right to promote a role for thePLO in selecting a Palestinian delegation that would holdpre-election talks with Israel in Cairo.   Israel, meanwhile, reserved the right to try to exclude the PLOfrom having any meaningful role.   On Dec. 6, Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Departmentspokeswoman, announced that Egypt had accepted Baker's proposal.She called it a ``step forward'' in the peace process.   But the PLO asserted a more direct role by giving its qualifiedacceptance to Robert Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisiawho has been the U.S. contact with the PLO since a dialogue wasopened a year ago.   And then Arafat sent a private letter to Bush indicating hiswillingness to make peace.   While the president did not reply, the opening of a PLO channelto the White House serves to undercut the idea that the UnitedStates is negotiating with Egypt, not the PLO.   Still, Shamir is standing by his commitment to proceed, despiteconcerns by more conservative members of his Likud coalition thatthe PLO's prestige and power might be enhanced.   Within hours of receiving a summary _ but not the text _ ofEgypt's acceptance of Baker's proposal, Shamir and other members ofthe Israel ``inner cabinet'' notified the State Department it wouldgo ahead with preparations. The cabinet designated Rubinstein forthe job last Sunday.</TEXT></DOC>
