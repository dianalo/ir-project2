More accurate procedures than those previously availableare offered to correct the americium count rate for dead time and Compton-scatteredcesium radiation. Procedures are also presented for the direct measurementof system dead times, based on single-channel analyzer control of deadtime. The concept of a maximum system processing rate is discussed, particularlyemphasizing its implications for the theoretically achievable measurementprecision using available technology. A calibration procedure is offeredto improve this precision, by reducing or eliminating the highest (emptycell) count rate from the calibration procedure. To also improve thetheoretical system precision, the optimal range of the ratio of correctedamericium to cesium count rates is found. A method is presented for determiningthe actual precision and accuracy of measurements.</TEXT></DOC>
