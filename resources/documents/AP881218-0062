(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thieves who stole toys for poor childrenwere foiled by donors who flooded a collection center with thousandsof dollars worth of gifts and checks, charity workers said.   Barbara Zahner, executive director of Sacred Heart CommunityServices, said she was overwhelmed by the response after thievesbroke into a storeroom and took the best toys among the 2,000 setaside for needy children.   ``I'm just astonished at the goodness of people,'' said Zahner.   Several hundred people drove up over the weekend and left giftsand donations, including teddy bears, bicycles and board games, shesaid.   ``You can't get any lower than stealing children's toys,'' saidGary Miller, who came to the center with his family to help sort theitems.   The thieves took only the best toys, including new stuffedanimals, the doll babies and trucks, Zahner said Friday.   Sacred Heart Community Services holds a toy giveaway each year,allowing about 1,000 parents who register to choose from the new andused toys. This year's giveaway will take place Monday.   Zahner said two men were seen walking down the hall with fullplastic garbage bags Thursday night, but no one paid much attentionto them.   There were no signs of forced entry, so Zahner said she suspectsthe thieves may have had a key to the building.</TEXT></DOC>
