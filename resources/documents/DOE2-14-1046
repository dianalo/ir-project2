The thermal desorption spectrum(the dependence of the desorption rate to the sample temperature), thedesorption action order and the desorption activation energy have beenobtained for main kinds of desorpted gases. These data are useful inchoosing materials and cleaning methods for vacuum chambers of fusiondevices.</TEXT></DOC>
