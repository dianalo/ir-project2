Faced with ethnic and social tensions, rapidly growing inflationand labor unrest, the country is now split into what looks like anunbridgeable rift between two of its six republics _ Slovenia andSerbia.   Some lawmakers, newspapers and organizations even raise theissue of civil war.   In an unprecedented move, Serbia on Nov. 29 severed allpolitical and business ties with the northern region of Sloveniaafter authorities there banned a rally planned by Serbs seeking totopple Slovenia's liberal leadership.   Except for a desperate warning that the country's unity is``seriously'' threatened by the clash, Yugoslavia's dividedleadership has done nothing to ease tensions.   Yugoslavia has for years been a socialist showcase despite itsone-party system, with a relatively free press and no travelrestrictions.   But its political, economic and social problems have mushroomedsince the death in 1980 of President Josip Broz Tito, whosecharisma was seen as a major force in keeping Yugoslavia togetherand submerging regional tensions.   The man in the center of Yugoslavia's current turmoil isSerbia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, described in Slovenia andsome other republics as ``a Stalinist, dogmatist and totalitarianleader.''   In his speech to the Serbian Parliament Tuesday, Milosevicdenounced the Slovenian leadership for not allowing ananti-Slovenian rally by Serbs planned in the Slovenian city ofLjubljana.   Milosevic vowed that Serbia will not re-establish ties withSlovenia ``until the conservative, aggressive and brutal''Slovenian leaders step down.   Commenting on Milosevic's speech, the Croatian Vjesnik dailysaid Thursday that the Serbian leader's ``stubborn ultimatum'' isaimed at imposing his hard-line brand of Communist orthodoxy on therest of the country.   The newspaper described as ``grotesque'' Milosevic's accusationsagainst Slovenia and appealed to the country's leadership to stopthe Serbian president and prevent him from ``leading the country tocivil war.''   Similarly, Radio Zagreb last week said, ``Yugoslavia is on theverge of war with itself.''   Milosevic has purged thousands of opponents in Serbia, andseveral independent political and human rights groups, which aregrowing elswhere in the country, have been banned in the southernrepublic.   On Thursday, a prominent Serbian journalist appeared in court toanswer charges of leading an unofficial gathering that describedMilosevic's recent re-election as Serbia's president as``undemocratic.''   In Slovenia, its liberal-minded leadership advocates regionalautonomy and has already legalized several opposition parties thatare to contest the first-ever free, multiparty elections in postwarYugoslavia, scheduled in Slovenia for March.   ``Serbia's move against Slovenia represents an attack by atotalitarian concept of (Communist) party monopoly against all whostrive for democratic reforms and whose oppinions differ from thoseof Serbian political leaders,'' said a statement released bySlovenian Central Committee.   Slovenian leaders believe Milosevic wants to provoke a showdownwith their republic in order to turn public attention away from hiseconomic and political failures.   An announced $1 billion public loan, described as a centerpieceof Milosevic's economic policies in Serbia, has all but collapsedwhen government officials were able to secure only about 3 percentof the planned sum.   Despite Milosevic's promises to halt ethnic Albanian unrest inthe southern Serbian province of Kosovo, disturbances there havecontinued unabated.   Yugoslavia's parliament is to meet next week for an urgentsession to discuss the country's crisis.   ``Comrades, our country is falling appart,'' said aparliamentary deputy Thursday.   Western diplomats in Belgrade point out that the split withinYugoslavia could not have come at a worse time for the reformistgovernment of Premier Ante Markovic, which is currently negotiatingwith the International Monetary Fund on obtaining crucial new loansdesigned to repay the country's $17 billion foreign debt.   The diplomats say Milosevic's ``irrational moves'' couldcollapse the delicate negotiations that began Thursday, therebythreatening radical market-oriented reforms Markovic is trying toimplement in Yugoslavia.</TEXT></DOC>
