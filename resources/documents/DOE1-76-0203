This report is one ina series being written by the Materials Characterization Center (MCC)at Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) on spent fuel ATMs. The ATMs arereceiving extensive examinations to provide a source of well-characterizedspent fuel for testing in the US nuclear waste repository program. ATM-103consists of 176 full-length irradiated fuel rods with rod-average burnupsof about 2600 GJ/kgM (30 MWd/kgM) and less than 1% fission gas release.Characterization data include 1) as-fabricated fuel design, irradiationhistory, and subsequent storage and handling; 2) isotopic gamma scans;3) fission gas analyses; 4) ceramography of the fuel and metallographyof the cladding; 5) special fuels studies involving analytical transmissionelectron microscopy (AEM); 6) calculated nuclide inventories and radioactivitiesin the fuel and cladding; and 7) radiochemical analyses of the fuel andcladding. Additional analyses of the fuel are being conducted and willbe included in planned revisions of this report. 10 refs., 103 figs.,63 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
