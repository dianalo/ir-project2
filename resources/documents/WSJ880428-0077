It's Raining   Dollars From Heaven   WHO SAYS you can't take it with you? Not Armand Hammer. Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s 89-year-old chairman and chief executive officer recently signed an employment contract with the company that promises not only to pay him a yearly minimum of $1.5 million while he's alive and serving but that also, in the event of his death, obliges Occidental to pay his personal foundation a lump sum totaling at least seven years of compensation.    The new contract was signed a year before Dr. Hammer's preceeding agreement was to expire. The earlier pact offered a less generous guaranteed minimum salary of $600,000. Last year, Dr. Hammer's cash compensation, including various bonus payments, totaled just over $1.9 million -- a 58% boost from the $1.2 million he was paid in 1986.    If Dr. Hammer were to die tomorrow, the check to his foundation would be more than $19 million. But Occidental and Dr. Hammer apparently don't foresee an immediate use of the clause that will benefit the foundation. The chairman's employment contract runs at least to Feb. 1, 1998, at which time Dr. Hammer will be 99. After that, the contract automatically extends indefinitely.    Enjoy the Report,   Then Forget It   THE COVER PHOTO of Gibraltar Financial Corp.'s 1987 annual report shows a sun-splashed housing development. In that regard, the document looks pretty much like that issued by any other big California savings and loan company.    But you can't tell an annual report by its cover.    Inside the Gibraltar report is a letter on the company's stationery that, although bound into the report, appears to have been an afterthought. Which it was.    Says the letter: &quot;During the printing of the attached annual report, Gibraltar made a major announcement, the substance of which follows.&quot; The letter then recounts Gibraltar's announcement on March 4 that its 56-year-old chairman and chief executive officer, Herbert J. Young, retired after more than 35 years with the company. The letter was signed by Jay Janis and James N. Thayer, who were named to succeed Mr. Young as, respectively, chairman and chief executive officer.    There are those who say that Mr. Young's retirement was precipitated by Gibraltar's whopping $131 million loss last year. The letter doesn't go into that. But the need for the letter becomes apparent when the pages of the annual report are turned to reveal a smiling photo of Mr. Young, identified by his former titles, and Mr. Young's own letter to shareholders; his letter says that the events of last year -- including a 75% drop in Gibraltar's stock price and the suspension of its dividend -- &quot;added up to a painful experience for all of us.&quot;    Yes indeed.    Mr. Janis says that Gibraltar didn't junk the report because to have done so would have cost the company &quot;many thousands of dollars and several weeks of time.&quot; As he points out, &quot;clearly, it would have taken all new pictures.&quot;    How Deep a Hole   Can Fred Hartley Dig?    FEMINISTS HAVE long looked askance at Fred L. Hartley, chairman and chief executive officer of Unocal Corp. Of particular concern has been the lack of women officers and directors at Unocal. For his part, the 71-year-old Mr. Hartley has complained that the women whom he had considered as directors lacked the necessary scientific and engineering background to be on the oil company's board.    Against that background, Mr. Hartley announced at Unocal's recent annual meeting that the company had elected Karen A. Sikkema vice president for corporate communications -- the first female vice president in Unocal's 98-year history. The announcement was met by applause.    Joked Mr. Hartley to Ms. Sikkema: &quot;That applause, Karen, was for all the directors.&quot;    After the meeting, Mr. Hartley said that Ms. Sikkema is eminently qualified for her new post. &quot;I was kidding her,&quot; he explained. &quot;She's a nice gal.&quot;    And what of efforts to find a woman to serve on Unocal's board? Qualified candidates, it seems, continue to elude Mr. Hartley. He summed up: &quot;We don't need a woman who's an expert in fashion.&quot;    Their Vacation Videos   Feature Filing Cabinets   IT CAN BE expensive for a company when its executives' noses are too close to the grindstone.    At Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing Co. in St. Paul, Minn., the latest proxy statement discloses that hordes of employees, from the chairman on down, hadn't been taking all their earned vacation time -- like thousands of days of it. Since that was determined by the company to be an unreasonable liability, it decided to change its vacation rules.    Under the old rules, a 3M employee could pile up three years of vacation; theoretically, a veteran earning five weeks annually could take 15 weeks at once. Now, however, employees can only carry over one year's time off. &quot;It's use it or lose it,&quot; a spokesman says.    But rule change or no, the company didn't want employees walking out en masse to use vacation time, so it paid cash in lieu of vacation days. The amount was well into the millions of dollars, the spokesman says.    Vacation pay awarded to senior executives totaled $310,276, the proxy reports. That amount includes $59,202 to Allen F. Jacobson, 3M's chairman and chief executive officer, for 18 days' vacation. And that works out to $3,289 a day, or about enough to see London or Paris in style. </TEXT></DOC>
