With bank financing scarce for full-scale buy-outs,executives of funds with billions of dollars sitting idle arebuying more minority stakes in companies. In doing so,however, they must sacrifice some control over the companiesto their investing partners, which often are corporationswith strategic agendas rather than short-term investmentgoals.</LP><TEXT>   Last week, Forstmann Little andamp; Co. agreed to invest $350million for a 33% stake in Whittle Communications L.P., afast-growing but unconventional media company whose plans toput television programming with advertising in schools havestirred controversy.   Last month, Blackstone Group made a bid for a 35% interestin Six Flags Corp., a financially troubled amusement parkoperator, alongside Time Warner Inc., which will hold a stakeof just under 50% if Six Flags bondholders accept the offer.   In April, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., the largestbuy-out operator, agreed to invest $283 million for apotential 17% holding in Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc.to help Fleet acquire Bank of New England.   One person familiar with the thinking of TheodoreForstmann, general partner at Forstmann Little, said theWhittle stake may be the first of several smaller investmentsby the firm &quot;in unusual growth situations&quot; outside thetraditional buy-out format. One reason, the same person said,was the difficulty of obtaining bank debt, which typicallyfinances up to 50% of a buy-out.   John Castle, chairman of Castle Harlan Inc., a buy-outfund operator, says, &quot;I think it's probable that there willbe more of this sort of thing.&quot;   James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,the buy-out funds run by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., attributes thetrend to the fact that &quot;there is so little financing fortraditional buy-outs, and there's so much equity on thesidelines.&quot; Buy-out funds, he estimates, have more than $10billion to be invested.   Stephen Schwarzman, president of Blackstone Group, says&quot;deals are easier to finance with corporations&quot; as partners.&quot;It's pretty clear,&quot; he added, &quot;that as the amount ofleverage per transaction has gone down, a natural evolutionis more joint bids.&quot;   Still, one New York buy-out executive said he wassurprised that Mr. Forstmann would enter a joint venturewithout absolute control, particularly since Whittle'schairman, Christopher Whittle, is known as such astrong-willed entrepreneur.   Mr. Forstmann declined to comment on the control aspectsof his investment. However, people familiar with his thinkingsaid he will have an effective veto power over majordecisions.   Mr. Forstmann, the same people added, could even removeMr. Whittle -- but only with the agreement of Time Warner,which owns 50% of Whittle and would retain 33% if Forstmannexercises its option to acquire 33%. Mr. Forstmann, theysaid, showed he can resist pressure to invest when buy-outprices hit sky-high levels in the late 1980s.   Paul Raether, a KKR partner, says KKR decided to team upwith Fleet/Norstar after concluding that &quot;the powers that bein Washington&quot; wouldn't allow a Wall Street buy-out firm toacquire a financial institution. Regulators, KKR believed,were concerned about catching flak if they approved salesthat turned out to be too profitable for the acquirers. Sucha backlash had occurred after the government sold ailingsavings and loan institutions at bargain prices to suchseasoned deal makers as Ronald Perelman and Robert Bass.   It's nothing new for buy-out firms to team up withindustrial partners. Blackstone acquired two railroads in thelate 1980s in joint ventures with USX Corp. and Union PacificCorp. Last week, Occidental Petroleum Corp. sold itsnatural-gas liquids business for $691 million to a jointventure between Occidental and the Dallas buy-out firm ofHicks Muse andamp; Co.   Nor is it new for some funds to take minority stakes.Corporate Partners, a fund managed by Lazard Freres andamp; Co.,was formed to buy minority stakes in companies undergoingsome management change, often to protect them from hostiletakeovers. However, the urgent need for such &quot;white-squire&quot;funds has ebbed with the drop-off in hostile takeoverthreats.   Thomas Hicks, chairman of Hicks Muse, says one factor thatmay be driving unorthodox transactions is that the highflyingstock market, now trading at near-record levels, is valuinglarge public companies at much higher prices than big buyoutfunds want to pay.   Blackstone's Mr. Schwarzman points out that even if thejoint owners share decisions on such issues as capitalspending, mechanisms can be arranged in advance for suchcrucial issues as the buy-out fund's ability to sell itsstake after a certain period of time.</TEXT></DOC>
