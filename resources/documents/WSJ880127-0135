The National Assembly, whose main purpose is to elect the president every six years, is so feeble -- 301 of its 940 members are at least 80 years old -- that the oldest members were warned to stay away from a Christmas Day session for fear that opposition protests outside the meeting hall might give them heart attacks.    The Control Yuan, entrusted with investigating corrupt officials, has become so rickety that it can hardly function.    But the problem is most acute in the third and most important chamber, the Legislative Yuan, which political analysts say must become a vital decision-making body if Taiwan hopes to make the shift from Chiang-family rule to a government of elected officials and institutions.    President Chiang Ching-kuo, who died Jan. 13, made clear his desire to resuscitate the wheezing legislature. But of all his proposed reforms, this one is likely to prove the most difficult to implement.    On paper, the Legislative Yuan has 884 seats, but only 312 are now filled. That is because most are reserved for the Chinese mainland, which Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, claims to represent. The aging lawmakers, elected in 1948 in the last days of Nationalist rule on the mainland, have been dying in droves.    The dilemma facing President Lee Teng-hui, Mr. Chiang's successor, is how to revitalize the legislature without relinquishing the Kuomintang's control or its claim to represent all of China.    The Kuomintang finds it a struggle to round up enough lawmakers to make the daily quorum of 127. After registering their attendance, many return home. Others head for darkened &quot;nap rooms&quot; where attendants hand out blankets and help them settle into cushioned reclining chairs.    While life is quiet in the nap rooms, the scenes are getting tumultuous in the meeting room downstairs, where the 13 members of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party are in what they see as a knockdown battle for democracy. In a society that respects its elderly, these legislators curse their aging Kuomintang colleagues as &quot;old thieves&quot; and &quot;monkeys.&quot; &quot;Nobody is stupid enough to believe they represent the mainland,&quot; says You Ching, one of the party's more vocal legislators.    Mr. You and other Democratic Progressive Party brawlers have been known to dive across tables to rip the microphones out from under the 82-year-old legislative speaker's nose, making him cry on one occasion. They grapple with younger Kuomintang lawmakers until groups of them roll across the floor tearing up one another's hand-tailored business suits.    The star attraction of the pandemonium is Taiwan's Rambo, as he is dubbed by the press, a stocky 33-year-old named Chu Kao-cheng who has mastered the art of taunting his opponents into a fury. His antics once provoked an elderly ruling-party legislator to attack him with a cane. Mr. Chu blocked him, sending him sprawling.    &quot;My campaign message was that I'd introduce an earthquake in the Legislative Yuan, and I've done what I said,&quot; Mr. Chu says.    His behavior bewilders 77-year-old Wu Yen-huan, one of the Kuomintang's most active and popular members. Born near Beijing the year before the Qing dynasty fell in 1911, Mr. Wu strides through the legislature's red-brick halls in his dark blue, ankle-length scholar's robe. Sitting in a coffee shop in the legislative building, with a half-dozen elderly colleagues dozing on nearby couches, Mr. Wu squints through thick glasses and says that as long as China's &quot;Communist rebellion&quot; continues, mainland representation must be retained in Taiwan. He says he wants infirm lawmakers to retire. But, he adds, &quot;It's our duty to continue doing our duty.&quot;    One of the shrewdest of the new breed of Kuomintang lawmakers is 37-year-old Jaw Shao-kang. Elected in 1986, Mr. Jaw is Taiwan's first American-style, made-for-television politician, with his own polling organization and an insatiable appetite for the latest issues.    Son of a China-born high-school teacher, he left his job as an engineer with a U.S. oil company and returned to Taiwan in 1975 to get involved in politics. Today, he represents a challenge for Kuomintang leaders accustomed to issuing orders instead of dealing with ideas that bubble from the junior ranks.    For example, on Jan. 19 -- only the sixth day in office for President Lee -- Mr. Jaw dominated the headlines by organizing a petition signed by almost every Taiwan-elected Nationalist lawmaker. The petition, which urges appointing Mr. Lee, a native-born Taiwanese, as acting party chairman, is designed to thwart old-guard plans to give the post to a mainlander.    &quot;The Legislative Yuan is becoming the center of politics in Taiwan,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
