(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a county where fence posts outnumberpeople, the signs on the posts tell what people are thinking:``Boyd County Held Hostage,'' ``Dump the Dump Queen,'' and``PinnochiOrr.''   They aren't the only blemishes on the pastoral landscape in thesparsely populated ranchland among the rolling foothills of theNiobrara River in northeastern Nebraska.   Since a developer named a site near Butte last December as itschoice for a five-state low-level radioactive waste warehouse, arancher who opposes the dump has staged a 30-day hunger strike andGov. Kay Orr has received a death threat.   The dump has divided neighbors and even families in Boyd County,a slice of farm country along the South Dakota line about 200 milesnorth of Lincoln. And now, it has become part of the governor'srace between Mrs. Orr, the nation's first Republican woman to beelected governor, and her Democratic challenger, Ben Nelson.   Mrs. Orr has been called ``PinnochiOrr'' after the storybookpuppet whose nose grew when he lied. She supports the dump, butopponents say she lies by saying that most community residentsagree with her.   Nelson, who opposes the dump, has been accused of makingpolitical hay out of the situation.   Nebraska is one of the states farthest along on the road tocomplying with a federal law that requires all states to dispose oftheir own low-level radioactive waste by Jan. 1, 1993.   The law allows states to form associations to dispose of thewaste. Nebraska belongs to the Central Interstate Low-levelRadioactive Waste Compact with Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana andOklahoma.   Nelson and other opponents say there is some doubt that thenation needs more dumps. They also say that only California andNebraska appear to be trying to comply with federal guidelines.   Mrs. Orr's legal aide, Bud Cuca, said the governor wants tointroduce measures in the January legislative session to ensurethat other states have complied with federal law before Nebraskaissues a license for the dump.   The state has already begun a yearlong review of the licenseapplication by US Ecology.   Earlier this month, Mrs. Orr said she wouldn't be campaigning inBoyd County, which has about 3,000 residents, because she hadreceived a death threat. The Nebraska State Patrol said it wasinvestigating the letter that Mrs. Orr received last August.   ``I don't believe that Gov. Kay Orr is afraid to come to BoydCounty. I think she is ashamed to come to Boyd County,'' said JimSelle, a founder of the anti-dump group Save Boyd County and memberof a monitoring committee appointed to oversee development of thewaste site.   Some Boyd County officials have welcomed the money the dump maybring. Opponents have said they fear accidents and long-termeffects of the waste.   ``You have a county with one great big, broken heart and nobodyseems to care,'' said Lowell Fisher of Spencer, a town about 10miles from the waste site.   Fisher, 50, lost 36 pounds when he staged a month-long hungerstrike that began Sept. 17.   He declined to say why he ended his fast Thursday or if heconsidered the battle against the dump to be lost.   Fisher says there are children in Boyd County who no longerspeak to their parents because of disagreements over the dump. Dumpofficials say one of the regular protesters at the fenced-in siteis the father of one of the guards hired to protect it.   Guards have complained that they have been harassed; barbed wireon fences has been cut, and tire spikes have been found on workroads. Jim Neal, a US Ecology spokesman, says residents near theproject who support it have had their fences cut and their cattlehave gotten loose.   Last month, a grand jury noted the difficulty of finding peoplefor a monitoring committee to oversee work at the site. The reason:Nearly everyone in the county had too strong an opinion to take anobjective view.</TEXT></DOC>
