Ferguson</HL><DD> 12/08/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   If Ronald Reagan were a more mean-spirited fellow, he might call Kiltek Corp. and ask whether Willie Warhead could be programmed to wipe out all Washington satirists living in Greenwich Village. The toll would amount to one Mark Alan Stamaty, creator of Kiltek, Willie and a host of other parodies in the &quot;Washingtoons&quot; cartoon strip that originates in the Village Voice and, more important, is picked up weekly in the Washington Post.    Mr. Stamaty has published his second collection of the hilarious strips, titled &quot;More Washingtoons&quot; (Prentice Hall, unpaged, $8.95), and he's a cruise missile aimed at Reaganism. Actually, Mr. Stamaty's a genius at zeroing in on not just the president, but on the many subluminaries who come and go in the Reagan Revolution and on the glib cant of Washington &quot;talking points.&quot; Adversary that he is, Mr. Stamaty plays on many of the worn caricatures of the administration (e.g. greed, militarism), but does it with such seeming innocence that only a truly sober partisan wouldn't come away smiling.    &quot;Washingtoons&quot; even has inscribed a genus of politician through the character of Bob Forehead, leader of the JFK Look-Alike Caucus in Congress. Obviously modeled after Jack Kemp but applicable to a number of his colleagues, Mr. Forehead is the primary mouthpiece for a platform of tax cuts, Star Wars and deregulation that has swept America off its feet.    Bob Forehead is a former game-show host whose kitchen cabinet consists of Gerard Oxboggle, chairman of Glominoid Corp., which makes bombs and pollutes the environment. The crusty Oxboggle appears periodically to carry the Get Government Off Our Back banner.    Mr. Forehead's wife, Ginger, is a frequent foil for him. With her instinctive skepticism about her husband's vacuous rhetoric (he is advised by &quot;charismaticians&quot; and &quot;perceptual engineers&quot;), she is &quot;an opportunity for sanity,&quot; Mr. Stamaty says. But, like the other voices of ingenuous America that appear as the cartoonist's alter egos, she usually ends up back under the spell of the feel-good factor.    Like any good cartoonist, this one is unfair. Yet, the below-the-Beltway punches are thrown with what one profiler called &quot;an intentionally primitive, childlike style,&quot; and the sting doesn't last long. The strip began with a story line but now mostly goes with the Potomac flow.    The 39-year-old Mr. Stamaty goes about his work in a surprisingly methodical way, reading what informed Washington reads and taping hours of television news. His most helpful source, he says, is C-SPAN, where he can see many of the players unfiltered.    He says he also asks a lot of questions. (&quot;I take myself very seriously, like David Broder, and then in the end it comes out as Mickey Mouse.&quot;) These days he gets down to Washington only for special legwork; recently, he attended a weapon-makers trade show. But, when the Post's editorial-page editor, Meg Greenfield, broached the idea of a strip after the first Reagan inauguration, he spent several months nosing around in the capital. He had been doing a similar cartoon in the Voice built around his Village neighborhood.    A post-Reagan &quot;Washingtoons&quot; is hard to imagine, though Mr. Stamaty says he could accommodate a George Bush presidency with no trouble, and Mr. Kemp is of course a natural. But pressed a bit over a sushi tray in the Village, he admits to lingering discomfort with the politicized strictures of his present genre. He finds himself, in the recent words of an alter ego, &quot;a micro man in a macro world.&quot; Eventually, he thinks, he'd like to get back to looking at life on a human scale.    Plucking Mr. Stamaty from his element was a chancy move by Ms. Greenfield, as the strip doesn't reek of seriousness. But it has settled well, and it has been picked up by the Philadelphia Inquirer, San Francisco Examiner and some smaller papers.    The cartoonist eschews the &quot;narrowness&quot; of left and right and, recalling his frosty reception at a pro-Sandinista symposium on the Lower East Side, says, &quot;It really frustrates me when people I generally agree with won't allow a certain line of questions.&quot; But, for a man who makes a living at poking fun, he is acutely sensitive about how his words will be received in the New York artists' community. He describes his political prototype as an &quot;idealized Mo Udall,&quot; and repeatedly cites toxic waste and peace as an agenda. He acknowledges it would be hard for him to satirize Ralph Nader. He has never done Jesse Jackson.    So Mr. Stamaty will not cease to be a pain for the Reaganites, who have lost some of their cushion since the book came out. And his prey will have to be wary, for he is a nimble hunter. The genius of his strip is in the way he sets up the kill. &quot;Usually,&quot; he says, &quot;I don't have that much time to draw it.&quot;    ---   Mr. Ferguson is editorial-features editor of the Journal. </TEXT></DOC>
