The suit, filed by Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., in U.S. District Court here, maintains that the Bank Board's investment rule violates a state's authority to regulate the institutions it charters and exceeds the agency's congressional authority to regulate state-chartered thrifts on a case-by-case basis.    Lincoln asks the court to strike down the regulation, first issued in February 1985.    The Bank Board moved to limit the type and amount of equity investments that federally insured, state-chartered thrifts could make with funds deposited with them. The board argued that the failure of a thrift with such investments costs the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp. more money than the failure of an institution without equity investments. The FSLIC, an arm of the Bank Board, insures an Sandamp;L's deposits to the extent of $100,000 per depositor.    The original regulation barred a thrift from investing more than 10% of its assets without Bank Board approval. Last month, the Bank Board approved a new rule, to take effect April 16, that bases the limit on a thrift's capital as well as on its assets. The new rule's limitations on Lincoln are even more stringent than the original rule's, according to the suit.    California, which granted Lincoln's charter, doesn't place a specific limit on a thrift's real estate investments but does limit equity investments to 5% of assets.    Lincoln has been an ardent critic of the Bank Board's investment regulation. The Sandamp;L has about 20% of its $3.87 billion of assets in direct investments and has been rebuffed by the Bank Board in all its efforts to make new investments.    Lincoln has been disputing with the Bank Board over the rule. In late 1984, as the Bank Board considered the issue, Lincoln sought and received permission from California thrift regulators to make investments exceeding the Bank Board's limit.    Lincoln also has received attention because of its connections with Bank Board member Lee Henkel. The thrift made at least $61.9 million in loans to corporations and partnerships in which Mr. Henkel had an interest as well as a personal loan of more than $250,000 that has been paid. Mr. Henkel put all his business interests in a blind trust and had agreed to recuse himself from Bank Board votes involving thrifts with which he has dealt.    When the Bank Board discussed its investment limits in December, Mr. Henkel proposed a rule that, according to agency officials, could have effectively immunized Lincoln and another thrift from any enforcement actions in disputes with the agency over their investments. The proposal died for lack of a second.    Mr. Henkel has said he believed his proposal addressed an industry-wide problem. He didn't participate when the Bank Board revised the rule last month. </TEXT></DOC>
