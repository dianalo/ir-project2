Indeed, licensing may take offoverseas even before the products or processes involved haveestablished themselves in the U.S.   So says Eugene M. Lang, president of REFAC TechnologyDevelopment Corp., a New York company that helps othercompanies license their industrial technology. REFAC, foundedin 1952 by Mr. Lang, has negotiated hundreds of U.S. andforeign manufacturing licenses. It is currently involved withsuch diverse industrial technologies as liquid-crystaldisplays, bar-code scanning and robotics.</LP><TEXT>   The 72-year-old Mr. Lang says he has been an entrepreneursince age eight, when he peddled to other boys lead-weightedpieces for a game called street checkers. &quot;It was a veryprofitable business,&quot; he says. &quot;It kept me in hot dogs andanything else I needed.&quot;   In an interview, Mr. Lang provided some insights on howbusiness owners can profit from licensing:                                                                                                          Q. Why do so many small companies go into licensing,rather than start their own operations overseas?   A. Many small companies can't afford to invest capital inforeign facilities, and they don't have personnel to sendover there. Often, small-company owners don't even have thetime to acquaint themselves with foreign markets. Thealternative is to license -- to find someone who can capturethe market for you who is already at home in that market.                                                                                                          Q. How much income can a license produce, and howsignificant might that be for a small company?   A. We have royalty rates as low as one-eighth of 1% ofsales and as high as 15%. As a result, it's been myexperience that I've seen as much as one-third of totalprofits for a small business being derived from overseaslicenses. And besides profit, there's invaluable feedback --in research and development, marketing experience andengineering -- that you get from foreign licensees. You havean opportunity to exploit all that in the biggest and bestmarket of all, namely the U.S.                                                                                                          Q. For example?   A. With Heli-Coil {a fastener technology now owned byBlack andamp; Decker Corp.}, we had to develop an economic andtechnical rationale for the products. We had to spend a lotof money finding applications and testing them out, and theexperience we obtained through foreign licensees was oftremendous value. We brought back to America all thetechnical standards and proven applications. We later did thesame thing with a new type of rolling diaphragm {anotherindustrial part}.                                                                                                          Q. Is there still untapped potential for small companiesto benefit from licensing?   A. When I started out 40 years ago, just the word&quot;licensing&quot; was something that applied more to a dog than toa business. Now universities are involved in licensing, andmost big corporations are involved in licensing. There arelicensing textbooks. But the average small company hasn'tgiven much thought to licensing -- I would say there arethousands that aren't even aware of it. And many think oflicensing only in terms of products, whereas licensing canalso be very important in terms of processes. Maybe I'm onlytalking about bread -- a new process for mixing dough or forpackaging bread more effectively. A lot of business peopledon't realize their processes can be licensed. Others areintimidated; they're afraid they'll wind up giving theirsecrets away for nothing.                                                                                                          Q. Typically, when an opening does seem to exist, how longdoes it take for a newcomer to licensing to start earningroyalties?   A. You have to be prepared for it to be a slow process.Normally you don't take a product and assume that anything isgoing to happen in as little as one or two years. You have toexamine the market and figure how best to exploit it. Forexample, if you have a patented process, how do you evenfigure the basis for charging a royalty? Having a product orprocess that's merely better or different is not enoughtherehas to be enough economic value in it that you can get yourshare and keep the other guy profitable, too.                                                                                                          Q. Meanwhile, how much does an inventor or small companyhave to give up in exchange for marketing help overseas?   A. At REFAC we normally work on a 50-50 basis; we share inthe gross proceeds of the venture. But for the inventor, 50%of something is a lot better than 100% of nothing. If wedon't accomplish any good result, that's our loss.                                                                                                          Q. Which parts of the world are best for seeking licensingdeals?   A. The U.S., Japan and Western Europe, especially England,France, Germany. Going elsewhere is often a waste of time --you can accomplish deals but not make much money out of them.For example, in India I was able to get the government toapprove joint ventures -- but then there were problemsgetting dividends, getting raw materials, problems gettingimport permits.                                                                                                          Q. Why do you urge small companies to develop and licensetrademarks as well as products?   A. Patents dwindle in value as they age and as technologyadvances. But trademarks become more valuable the longerthey're used. With Heli-Coil, the patent expired, but thereare still foreign royalties in the seven figures. That'sbecause of the trademark plus the ongoing exchange of knowhowrelated to manufacturing improvements.                                                                                                          Q. What's the first thing a newcomer to licensing needs tothink about?   A. The first thing you have to do is define veryrealistically what it is you have to offer. There areenormous opportunities if manufacturers become introspectiveand try to evaluate the novelty of their own manufacturingexperiences: What is it that makes them competitive, what isit that makes their product better? You often make more moneyfrom licensing your know-how for production or productcontrol than you could from actually selling your finishedproduct in a highly competitive market.</TEXT></DOC>
