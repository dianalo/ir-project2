ManuelAntonio Noriega, while his aides try to quash criticism that theadministration operated in confusion during the failed coup.   But the president said Friday that his inaction should not beread as a signal that he would act the same way if another attemptis made by Panamanians.   ``I would not rule out any option,'' he told reporters whenasked if he would send in the military next time.   Bush said that after reviewing information about the coup, hebelieves he was right not to unleash U.S. forces stationed in theSouth American nation.   ``I'm not being stubborn, but as I look at all the information Iwouldn't have made a different decision then,'' Bush said.   But questions and criticisms from Capitol Hill, and even someadministration officials, persisted as to whether it would havebeen wiser to help the insurgents in the Panamanian Defense Forceswho tried to topple the dictator.   Bush explained his position during a closed-door meeting withSenate Republicans, and later talked to reporters about the matteroutside Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where he had a cystremoved from his finger.   ``We were willing to use force but not ... unless we know thecircumstances and have better information,'' presidential spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater said Bush told senators.   Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,charged Friday that a lack of clear policy guidance from Bush waslargely responsible for U.S. confusion. There should have beendefinite arrangements for how U.S. troops were to react in theevent of a coup, he said.   ``We have had a definite, longstanding policy in this country ofencouraging a coup'' in Panama, the Georgia Democrat toldreporters. ``We should anticipate that our policy ... mightsucceed. Then we have to know what we're going to do next.''   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman ofthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified in closed session before theSenate Intelligence and Armed Services committees, which arereviewing discrepancies surrounding U.S. involvement with the coup,contact with its participants and advance notice.   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said both insisted they ``would nothave changed their decision and recommendations to the president.''   A senior administration official, however, has said there arethings the administration should have handled differently.   Bush said the decision not to use force was made because ``itwasn't warranted under the existing circumstances.''   ``The commander-in-chief must have the lives of Americancitizens foremost in mind when making such a decision,'' he said.   Bush and Fitzwater disputed the assertion of Sen. Jesse Helms,R-N.C., that the rebels wanted to turn Noriega over to the UnitedStates.   The president said he still wants to see Noriega removed frompower, but ``there was never a chance to have him handed over tous.''   Fitzwater, trying to clarify other conflicting reports, reversedhis earlier statement that U.S. officials had not been in directcontact in advance with any coup leaders.   He confirmed that U.S. representatives had been in touch beforeTuesday with coup leader Maj. Moises Giroldi, who is believed dead.Giroldi, Fitzwater said, told the representatives Sunday that thecoup would occur.   Earlier, Fitzwater had said that advance word had come through athird party.   Fitzwater emphatically denied a Wall Street Journal report thatGiroldi's wife had tried to alert U.S. officials about the coupthree weeks ago.   Fitzwater also told reporters:   _A cable transmitted to Washington by U.S. military officials inPanama incorrectly stated that the rebels wanted the United Statesto take custody of Noriega. Fitzwater said the cable should havesaid the rebels ``won't'' let the U.S. have custody.   But he said it was irrelevant to Bush's decisions, because theincorrect cable didn't reach the White House.   _Despite early suspicions that Giroldi might actually beoperating a ``set up'' instead of a real coup effort, U.S.officials now believe he was sincere.   _Disputing a Wall Street Journal report, Fitzwater denied thatthe rebels had ever asked the United States to deploy a helicopterto take Noriega into custody.</TEXT></DOC>
