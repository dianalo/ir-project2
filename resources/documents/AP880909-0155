But after a day of talks Alan Tuffin, general secretary of theUnion of Communication Workers, said ``a number of points'' neededclarification and union leaders would meet with their negotiatorsMonday to reconsider the agreement.   ``There can be no misunderstandings between the Post Office andourselves,'' Tuffin said.   Bill Cockburn, managing director of the Post Office, approvedthe pact earlier Friday, according to a spokesman who was notidentified in line with Post Office rules. ``The document calls forending the strike as soon as possible,'' he said.   The tentative agreement schedules further talks on the centralstrike issue of bonuses for new employees in London and southeastEngland, where the cost of living is higher than in the rest ofBritain.   The union, which represents most of the service's 180,000workers, wants the bonuses paid throughout Britain.   More than 100 million pieces of mail remain unsorted by the90,000 sorters and deliverers who walked out in a 24-hour workstoppage Aug. 31. The strike continued after Post Office officialshired temporary workers.   Counter workers who belong to the same union but have not beeninvolved in the bonus dispute said Friday they had taken a strikevote over a different issue but their mail ballots became lost inthe backlog of unsorted letters.   The union's 22,000 counter workers voted whether to strike overthe Post Office plan to close 750 branch offices or convert theminto private suboffices, said a union official.   The official said the results of the strike vote were to havebeen announced early next week but had been postponed.   A Post Office spokeswoman said half of the country's 1,500sorting offices were shut and the Belfast office was the only oneof 82 main sorting offices open.</TEXT></DOC>
