(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>There's more to clip art than meets the eye.andP;  Here's how to choose, edit, anduse it - plus a look at some of the top packages.andM;Everything from a simple letter to a company's statement can be improved withthe right graphic.andP;  Since most of us have only minimal artistic talent,there's a booming market in precreated graphics, called clip art.andP;  This&quot;canned&quot; artwork has several advantages: It's always ready for use; it neverwears out, no matter how often you use it; it can be edited and arranged incountless combinations; and it can be cataloged in any way that suits you.andM;At least 60 companies - ranging from the traditional clip-art giants (DynamicGraphics, Metro ImageBase) to mom-and-pop shops (Artbeats, 3G Graphics) -produce electronic artwork for the Mac.andP;  Size doesn't equate with quality,however; some of the best efforts come from the smallest clip-art companies,who lovingly craft each image rather than mass-produce artwork by scanning inand cleaning up images from a paper-based library.andM;With so much to choose from, how do you find the artwork that meets yourneeds? First, consider the use are you creating newsletters, advertisements,slide presentations, or party invitations? The output format can greatlyaffect your choice of file type and drawing style.andP;  What subject categoriesdo you need? Clip-art themes range from popular (business, sports, holidays)to specialized (medical, military, maps).andP;  What hardware and software willyou be using to import, edit, and print the images? Do you need colorartwork? Don't invest in color EPS images if your only printer is anImageWriter.andP;  On the other hand, if you plan to edit your artwork inIllustrator, a library of MacPaint images will be of little value.andP;  Do youprefer images with coarse or fine resolution? MacPaint images have aresolution of 72 dpi (dots per inch), providing grainy images that are proneto the jaggies; a TIFF package might offer smoother images with 300-dpiresolutions.andP;  Do you need a steady stream of new images? Several companies,such as Dynamic Graphics and MultiAd Services, offer subscription services.andM;To get you started, here's some sage advice on clip artistry, includinginformation on file formats and the storing and editing of images.andP;  Althoughwe don't have space to list every clip-art company and its offerings, we'vereviewed a few of our favorites and compiled a list of 20 vendors thatproduce a broad range of artwork so that you can compare prices, formats, andsubject matter.andP;  (Some packages in the table have been reviewed previously;see &quot;Clip-Art Collections,&quot; August'89, page 173, and &quot;Classy Clip Art,&quot;October 89, page 229.) In future issues, we'll review packages that coversingle topics (such as maps or airplanes), shareware offerings, and thegrowing number of collections available on CD-ROM.andM;File FormatsandM;Macintosh clip art is available in every file format MacPaint, PICT, TIFF,and EPS - and encompasses the two major types of electronic graphics (seeFigure 1).andP;  Bit-mapped images are stored as layouts of individual pixels, orbits, whereas object-oriented clip art is composed of a series of drawinginstructions.andP;  Bit maps are the default graphic type for anything that'sscanned, painted, or captured from the screen.andP;  Many artists prefer theversatility of bit-mapped artwork for images with a hand-drawn or -paintedlook (see Figure 2).andP;  For example, you can create stippling andcross-hatching effects (such as electronic &quot;woodcuts&quot;) much more easily withbit-mapped images than with object-oriented art.andP;  Bit-mapped images do havetwo major drawbacks: They are prone to the jaggies if they are reduced,enlarged, or rotated, and their resolution can't be altered to take advantageof a printer's output capabilities.andM;Object-oriented images overcome these limitations.andP;  Because they are storedas mathematically described objects and paths, object-oriented graphics canbe resized and rotated with no loss of quality.andP;  They are ideal for technicalillustrations and other highly detailed work.andP;  In addition, object-orientedimages are resolution-independent, meaning they can be output at theprinter's best resolution.andP;  (For more information on graphics formats, filetypes, compatible applications, and format conversions, see &quot;MacUser Guide toGraphics Formats,&quot; September '90, page 266.)andM;The first Mac clip art was in MacPaint format, which holds black-and-whitebit maps with a resolution of 72 dpi.andP;  MacPaint is still the format of choicefor many people, because the files are small, simple, and easy to import intonearly every application, from page-layout programs to word processors.andP;  Someclip-art companies, such as Metro ImageBase, produce images in TIFF format,which stores bitmaps with higher resolutions (usually 150 to 300 dpi) and avariety of grays and colors.andP;  Image Club Graphics and a few other companiesoffer clip-art packages in PICT or PICT2 format, which can hold bothobject-oriented and bit-mapped art in a range of colors and resolutions.andO;PICT and PICT2 are also the formats in which the Clipboard and the Scrapbooktransfer their contents among applications.andM;Today, most new clip-art packages are in EPS (Encapsulated PostScript)format.andP;  The growing popularity of this object-oriented format stems from itsclean, sophisticated images and crisp handling of fine details, text, andgraduated fills.andP;  EPS images can be monochrome, gray-scale, or color, andthey print at the highest resolution available (see Figure 3).andP;  Instead ofshowing the actual PostScript image on-screen, EPS files display aquick-rendering preview image (in PICT format) that's a bit-mappedapproximation of the printed image.andM;The editability of EPS clip art depends on how the file was saved.andP;  Mostclip-art companies market EPS images saved as Illustrator files, which can beopened for full editing by both FreeHand and Illustrator or dropped directlyinto a page-layout application.andP;  Non-Illustrator EPS files cannot be edited;they can only be placed into page layouts and cropped or resized.andP;  Artbeats,for example, creates its EPS backgrounds in FreeHand, and its packagescontain two versions of each image: a non editable EPS file and the originalFreeHand file, in case you want to customize the artwork (which you then haveto resave as EPS before using it in a page-layout program).andM;Finally, there's 3-D clip art, which inhabits a world all its own (see Figure4).andP;  Both Enabling Technologies and Paracomp offer 3-D clip art, which issaved in the native format of the creating 3-D application (Pro3D or Swivel3D, respectively).andP;  Using an editing program that comes with each collection,you can open the files and position, illuminate, color, spin, scale, and/orcombine the images.andP;  When the 3-D scene looks right, you can export it toother applications in EPS, PICT, or MacPaint format.andM;Format Follows FunctionandM;Although you can use the same clip art for a variety of purposes, you shouldchoose a file format based on your primary output medium, because the type ofoutput can significantly affect image quality.andP;  Here are some pointers tohelp you choose your graphics for the job at hand.andM;PostScript printer.andP;  PostScript printers intended for personal and businessuse have resolutions of between 300 and 600 dpi.andP;  You can also obtainPostScript output from many QuickDraw printers by usingPostScript-interpretation software such as CAI's Freedom of Press.andM;In either case, EPS is the file format of choice, because it takes fulladvantage of the printer's PostScript capabilities.andP;  Object-oriented PICTimages also print at the printer's best resolution.andP;  MacPaint, PICT, and TIFFbit maps are other options, although they don't look as sharp or smooth.andM;Non-PostScript printer.andP;  Printers such as the LaserWriter IISC and HPDeskWriter can't interpret the PostScript language, so they print only thebit-mapped preview portion of EPS images.andP;  These printers handle MacPaint,monochrome-TIFF, and PICT images quite well, however.andM;If you must print an EPS image on a non-PostScript device, the trick is toproduce the best-looking preview image possible.andP;  To do this, open the EPSfile in FreeHand or Illustrator, select the entire image, and scale it up 400percent.andP;  This forces the preview image to be large and detailed.andP;  Resave theEPS file, import it into your layout, and reduce the image to one-fourth ofits size.andP;  The result is an effective increase in resolution to about 300dpi.andM;High-resolution imagesetter.andP;  Imagesetters have resolutions of 1,200 dpi ormore and are perfect for printing clip art with smooth gradients, sharplines, and high-resolution bitmaps.andP;  All the comments for PostScript laserprinters apply here; in addition, the resolution of bit-mapped images shouldbe 300 dpi for monochrome graphics and at least 150 dpi for gray-scale andcolor artwork.andM;Color separation.andP;  EPS and TIFF are your best bets, depending on the type ofgraphic.andP;  If you have a PICT2 bit-mapped image, use a color painting orimage-editing program to convert it to TIFF format.andM;Screen presentation.andP;  If you need clip art for projected presentations,self-running demos, or hypermedia, then high-resolution images will only slowthings down and eat up disk space.andP;  A monitor is a low-resolution device, soa 72-dpi MacPaint image looks just fine.andP;  PICT and TIFF images (bothmonochrome and color) are also acceptable.andP;  If you have a favorite EPS imageyou really must show, use FreeHand or Illustrator to open (not place) thefile and size it.andP;  Display the artwork with all its assigned colors and lineweights, and then take a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the image with a screen-captureutility such as Capture, QuickShot, or SnapJot.andP;  You now have a compact,low-resolution PICT2 bit map that you can paste or place into yourpresentation.andM;Slides.andP;  A film recorder can turn your presentation into sharp-looking 35mmslides.andP;  As with printers, film recorders can be divided into PostScript andnon-PostScript units, so many of the same comments apply.andP;  PostScript-drivenfilm recorders output EPS images beautifully, and the other clip-art formatsperform almost as well.andP;  NonPostScript film recorders work best with MacPaintand PICT images; they can print only the bit-mapped preview portion of EPSimages.andP;  If you need to include an EPS image, the scaling technique describedfor non-PostScript printers can help you obtain good-quality output.andM;Artful ManagementandM;Once you've purchased a few clip-art packages, you quickly learn that findingan image can be a time-consuming chore if you haven't organized yourcollection.andP;  Some clip-art suppliers have thoughtfully included utilities forbrowsing through and accessing their collections.andP;  For example, bothDubl-Click and T/Maker provide DAs that let you open, scale, edit, and copyMacPaint images.andP;  Dubl-Click's ArtRoundup also has a Slideshow feature thatlets you browse through many files at once without having to open and closeeach one.andM;If your clip-art packages don't come with such goodies, don't fret.andP;  Thereare other ways, both basic and specialized, to organize your art.andP;  For imagesstored on a hard disk, the simplest scheme is to sort them into appropriatelynamed folders.andP;  You can view each folder's contents by name, date modified,type (creator), size, and icon color.andP;  A file-finding utility can locate theoccasional lost needle.andP;  (A few companies, such as Metro ImageBase, usecryptic codes as filenames, which means you have to rename the files if youwant descriptive titles.)andM;For browsing through a clip-art collection, albeit slowly, you can useapplications you already own.andP;  Page-layout, presentation, and drawingprograms can import or directly open a variety of formats.andP;  Severalapplications, including Digital Darkroom, ImageStudio, and Studio/8, show apreview image in the Open dialog box.andP;  You can use outlining programs such asActa, MindWrite, and MORE (or Word's Outline view) to store and catalog anart collection.andP;  Equipped with the organizational tools of the outliner, youcan sort, search, hide, and/or display the art and then copy or print it.andM;HyperCard 1.2.5 stores only 72-dpi MacPaint bit maps, although you can usethe Clipboard to transfer other images in PICT format.andP;  If that suits yourneeds, you can create a stack that holds your art and assign words andphrases so you can search through the collection by name.andP;  (A few vendors,such as Spinnaker and T/Maker, offer their MacPaint collections as HyperCardstacks.) Spinnaker's Plus and Silicon Beach's SuperCard go a step further,letting you store color PICT and PICT2 images and offering 8-bit-colorpainting and drawing tools to boot.andM;Clipboard and scrapbook utilities are a notch up the organizational scale.andO;SmartScrap, from Solutions International, functionally replaces Apple'sScrapbook DA and offers expanded capabilities such as image naming,searching, thumbnail views, and the ability to select a portion of an imagefor copying.andP;  You can use the OptionCopy command to copy EPS art intoSmartScrap and then paste it into any application that accepts PICT format.andO;You can distribute your images among several scrapbook files and name themwhatever you like.andP;  A companion accessory, The Clipper, lets you preciselyscale and crop a graphic before you add it to a layout.andP;  Oiduvai's MultiClipis a hybrid of a clipboard and a scrapbook.andP;  The copied portion of a graphicis automatically stored in a clipboard that can hold multiple items.andO;MultiClip's window shows thumbnail views of each stored item and works in thesame way as a scrapbook does, letting you select a stored image and paste itinto another application.andM;The most elegant way to organize clip art is to use a specialized catalogingprogram.andP;  The best-known of these is Solutions' Curator, which comes as botha DA and an application (see Figure 5).andP;  Curator creates a catalog thatcontains thumbnails of each image along with identifying data such asfilename, image location, file type, and keywords.andP;  It recognizes theMacPaint, PICT, EPS (Mac and DOS versions), TIFF, PostScript, and SuperGlueformats and can perform some format conversions.andP;  You can search a Curatorcatalog by filename, keyword, or thumbnail view.andP;  As you acquire new artwork,you can add it to the catalog; a bundled program called Curator's Assistantcan even catalog a disk unattended.andM;Two other programs worth a mention are Symmetry's PictureBase and LoopSoftware's PictureBook.andP;  Instead of storing thumbnails, these catalogingutilities save the actual images in their libraries.andP;  They don't support asmany formats as Curator does, but they can automatically catalog scrapbookfiles as well as print a pictorial catalog of every image in the library.andO;Also keep an eye out for Multi-Ad Search, a new cataloging and retrievalprogram from Multi-Ad Services.andP;  Due to ship in November, Search can compilea catalog of images from a broad range of sources.andP;  It stores any fileformat, including 32-bit-color images, and can display either thumbnails (incolor) or actual images.andP;  Search works over a network, letting multiple usersaccess a single library, and it's fast - a demo version retrieved 3,400thumbnails in just two seconds.andM;Working with Bit MapsandM;Most MacPaint clip art contains multiple images in a single file.andP;  To extractsingle images, you need a painting program or utility (such as Dubi-Click'sArtRoundup or T/Maker's ClipOut) or you can import the entire file into yourpage-layout program and crop it to show just the desired image.andP;  Editingbit-mapped art is simple with a painting program.andP;  To add or change elements,you use tools such as the pencil and paintbrush.andP;  You can eliminate unwantedsections with an eraser or background-colored paintbrush, or you can cut awayparts with the selection tools.andP;  For general and specific techniques onworking with bit maps - including tips on copying, scaling, and invertingimages - check the manuals that come with your painting or clip-art packages.andO;In the meantime, here are a few pointers on customizing your clip art:andM;Resolution.andP;  Resizing bit-mapped artwork is an iffy proposition.andP;  Stretchingor enlarging a bit map can reduce the effective resolution, producing ablotchy, jagged image.andP;  To minimize distortion when resizing a bit map, scaleit by a factor of 2 - that is, a 50-percent reduction in size or a200-percent enlargement.andM;You can increase the apparent resolution of bit maps and obtainsharper-looking images - by shrinking them in a page-layout package, wordprocessor, or object oriented drawing program.andP;  These programs effectivelyshrink the bit map's component dots, retaining all the original detail.andP;  Toconvert a 72-dpi MacPaint image to 144 dpi, for example, reduce the graphic'ssize by 50 percent.andP;  The drawback is that the image must stay shrunk for itsdots to look smaller.andM;Printing options.andP;  Bit maps look best at their original size or when reducedor enlarged by a factor of 2.andP;  Because MacPaint images have a 72-dpiresolution, printing them at original size on a 300-dpi laser printer doesn'tcompletely eliminate distortion.andP;  For optimum results, you need a resolutionof 288 (72 x 4) dpi.andP;  To achieve this, print the image at 96 percent or checkPrecision Bitmap Alignment in the LaserWriter Options dialog box.andO;Unfortunately, this scales the entire page, not just the bit map.andM;If you check the Smoothing option in the LaserWriter Page Setup dialog box,your bit-mapped images will look smoother, with fewer jaggies on curves anddiagonals.andP;  Smoothed images do take longer to print, however, and sometimessmall areas (such as patterns) fill in or contours look misshapen.andM;Combining bit maps.andP;  You can make any area of a bit map transparent bycreating a one-pixel-wide tunnel to the outside (see Figure 6).andP;  This letsyou create a transparent overlay for a second bit-mapped graphic.andP;  Use anobject oriented program to produce composite images containing several piecesof bit-mapped art.andP;  Page-layout, drawing, and presentation programs treat bitmaps as free-floating objects, letting you rearrange individual elementswithout resorting to the tedious cut-and-paste routine.andM;Auto-tracing.andP;  A program with auto-tracing capabilities - such as Streamline,Canvas, or Illustrator - can turn your MacPaint or TIFF clip art intoobject-oriented PICT or EPS images.andP;  The auto-tracing process draws objects(lines or filled shapes) along the boundaries of the areas in a bit map.andP;  Thetraced image often has remarkable fidelity to the original.andP;  (For tips andtechniques on auto-tracing, see &quot;The Elements of Auto-Tracing,&quot; August '90,page 206.)andM;Editing Object-Opiented AptandM;In a collection of object-oriented clip art, each image usually resides inits own file, which simplifies the importing process.andP;  PICT and IllustratorEPS images can be edited down to the smallest detail, resized withoutdistortion, and printed at a printer's best resolution.andP;  There's relativelylittle PICT clip art, so we'll focus on EPS images.andP;  Two measures ofgood-quality EPS artwork are object grouping and opaque images.andP;  Again, seeyour documentation for full details about working with object-orientedimages.andM;Grouping.andP;  Most EPS images come grouped - that is, all elements areselectable as a single object - primarily so that sections don't tear offduring handling.andP;  Some clip art contains discrete components that are meantto be ungrouped and used individually.andP;  For example, when a picture of anotepad and pen is ungrouped, you have two individually useful images.andO;Grouping can also serve a second purpose: to organize elements of an image sothat you can color them easily.andP;  If the leaves in a floral border aregrouped, for instance, you can alter all their colors simultaneously, ratherthan tediously selecting and changing one leaf at a time.andP;  Grouping provideshidden value, because you're getting more usable art for your money; thedisadvantage is that you need a PostScript editing program to ungroup andedit the images.andP;  3G Graphics' collections are superb examples ofintelligently grouped, multipurpose artwork (see Figure 7).andM;Opaque images.andP;  Better-quality EPS graphics are usually opaque, meaning thatall white areas are actually filled with the color white instead of beingtransparent.andP;  This allows you to place an image on top of other page elementswithout the background's showing through.andP;  If an image is not opaque or has afew transparent elements, it may be due to shortcuts during the creationprocess.andP;  To check an image's solidity, place it on top of another objectsuch as a gray-filled rectangle.andM;Masking.andP;  Sometimes you might want to hide or remove sections of anobject-oriented image.andP;  If you have a drawing program and the art can beungrouped, you're in luck.andP;  Another alternative is to mask unwanted portionswith appropriately shaped objects.andP;  The precise technique depends on thegraphic and on which program(s) you have.andP;  For simple masks or cropping, youcan overlay areas with one or more white rectangles, ovals, or thick lines.andO;A polygon tool lets you hand-trace most complex shapes with fine control.andP;  Ifyour layout program has limited drawing capabilities, import the clip artinto a drawing program and construct the mask there.andM;Backgrounds and fills.andP;  Some clip-art offerings are meant to stay, literally,in the background.andP;  Artbeats offers EPS backgrounds that fill a page at fullsize, or they can be scaled to fit everything from a postage stamp to atabloid.andP;  In addition, the backgrounds can be cropped and masked to serve asfill patterns for other objects; Adobe also offers a complete package of filltextures.andP;  In general, place background items into a layout as late aspossible so that you're not always dodging them to get your work done orwaiting hours for printouts.andM;Backgrounds profoundly change the flavor of a layout, so test-print your workperiodically.andP;  This is especially true for EPS backgrounds, because theirpreview images may look different from the PostScript output.andP;  Be sure thatsmall text and objects don't get lost over background details; one solutionis to place solid shapes on top of the background as backdrops for your textblocks.andM;EPS conversions.andP;  Many popular programs, including word processors, can'timport EPS files directly.andP;  Fortunately, there are ways to convert an EPSimage into PICT format, which is accepted by many more applications.andP;  Somegraphics programs can import EPS and save as PICT, although you lose allPostScript data.andP;  A better alternative is to use the Option-Copy command.andO;This workaround converts EPS images to PICT but retains all the PostScriptinformation of the original EPS file, so that the image prints with fullPostScript quality.andM;To create a PICT image with embedded PostScript, first open the EPS image inFreeHand or Illustrator and select it.andP;  Hold down the Option key, and chooseCopy from the Edit menu (the keyboard shortcut won't work).andP;  This commandcopies both the PICT screen image and the PostScript data to the Clipboardand labels the combination as a PICT file.andP;  You can now paste this PICT/EPSimage into another program or store it in the Scrapbook.andP;  The Curator and thePictureBook graphics-management utilities can also convert EPS images to PICTformat with PostScript comments.andM;3-D Clip ANandM;Although 3-D clip art is versatile, it requires thoughtful handling.andP;  Ifyou're placing a 3-D image into a layout that contains other art, be sure themontage looks cohesive.andP;  Light the 3-D scene so that its color, shading, andshadows match the surrounding artwork.andP;  Orient objects so that theperspective looks right.andP;  When you've finished editing, export the scene inthe desired format but be sure to keep an editable 3-D version so that youcan alter the image if necessary.andM;Additional ResourcesandM;Once you've found a promising clip-art candidate, contact the company formore information and ask for a catalog or pictorial index so you can seewhich packages contain the images you need.andP;  Compare price versus quality andquantity, and check to see which packages are discounted at mail-orderhouses.andM;Many companies provide a wealth of advice in their manuals, plus examples ofthe art in action.andP;  Adobe, Dynamic Graphics, 3G Graphics, and T/Maker areexemplary in this regard.andP;  You also might check out Canned Art (PeachPitPress, $29.95), a massive pictorial compendium that includes some usefultips.andM;Finally, Clip Art Window Shopper is a new on-line service from Adonis thatlets you preview artwork from a variety of vendors and then downloadindividual images (for a fee) or place orders for complete packages.andP;  Theuser link originally ran only under Microsoft Windows, but a Mac versionshould be available by now.andP;  For more information, contact Adonis at (800)234-9497.andM;Senior editor Aileen Abernathy is MacUser's resident DTP expert; contributingeditor Salvatore Parascandolo is the graphics guru at Silicon Beach Software.andM;Capsule ReviewsandM;Adobe Collector's Edition: Patterns and TexturesandM;*****If you're an Illustrator user and haven't yet gotten your fill of clip art,then the Adobe Collector's Edition: Patterns and Textures is the package foryou.andP;  This superb collection of patterned fills has something for everyone,whether the job is advertising, architecture, mapping, or textile design.andO;The 400 or so PostScript dot and line screens (simple and graduated); basicand nature-based textures; geometric, primitive, and ornamental patterns; andthe standard patterns used in architecture, mapmaking, weather reporting, andgeology.andP;  Each fill has repeating elements, or tiles, that you can apply toany shape to produce a seamless patterned area (see example below).andP;  Somepatterns are transparent, so you can use them to simulate shadows or windowscreening.andM;As with Adobe's first Collector's Edition (Symbols, Borders andamp; Letterforms),the artwork is pretty plain as is.andP;  But's that's OK, because Adobe expectsyou to jazz it up.andP;  All the patterns are black-and-white, but the identicalelements of each pattern are subgrouped so that you can easily add shading orcolor (see example at left).andP;  The patterns are not saved as EPS files, so youcan't directly import them into a page-layout program.andP;  instead, you mustcreate an Illustrator document, use one or more patterns, and then save thefinal image as EPS.andM;This $225 collection is physically huge, requiring nine disks, and Adoberecommends 2 megabytes of RAM.andP;  The user manual is a treasure trove ofinformation.andP;  In addition to a pictorial catalog of the supplied patterns, afull-color section shows the various effects you can achieve by editing andcoloring the tiles.andP;  There's also a guide to meshing the patterns with yourartwork, some basics on selecting and moving objects, printing tips, and evenprocedures for making your own patterns.andP;  If you use Illustrator and want toextend both your business and artistic potential, this package is a must.andM;ArtbeatsandM;*****A well-chosen background on a book cover or magazine article canconveyimportant information about mood and content as well as add aestheticappeal.andP;  That's the concept behind Artbeats, a relatively new company startedby illustrator Phil Bates.andP;  In just over a year, Artbeats has produced fivepackages of sophisticated,  high-tech PostScript backgrounds.andP;  Natural Images1 and 2 feature  scenes from nature, such as marble, mountaintops, grass,water drops, clouds, and sand dunes.andP;  Potpourri and Dimensions 1 and 2contain abstract and geometric patterns.andP;  Each package contains 20 fullpagebackgrounds - actually ten images in both high- and low-contrast versions forversatility - and prices range from $79.95 to $129.95.andP;  Potential usesinclude book and report covers, stationery, advertisements, packaging, partyinvitations, and checks (see &quot;Avid&quot; box).andM;All images are created in FreeHand and take advantage of that program'sfacility with PostScript blends.andP;  Some images are transparent, so you canplace them over text or other backgrounds.andP;  For instance, place the wordParty behind the Confetti background (Potpourri coltion.andP;  Because you cancrop and size the backgrounds as you can any other graphic, you can even turnthem into shaped fills and borders.andM;The disks include both the original FreeHand files (for editing purposes) andEPS files ready to drop into your favorite page-layout program.andP;  The imageslook great just as they are, but if you want to edit them, you need somefamiliarity with FreeHand and its handling of colors and fills.andP;  Then you canopen a background such as Droplets (above) and apply sweeping changes, fromaltering the background color or shadows to changing the direction andintensity of the graduated fills.andP;  The manuals provide helpful design ideasplus tips on editing the original artwork.andP;  (At press time, Artbeats wasabout to release a CD-ROM disc containing all five packages plusIllustrator88 versions of the files and several business-card templates.)andM;These are large and complex backgrounds - one file can be several hundredkilobytes - which means they demand RAM and take a while to print.andP;  To speedup printing, the EPS images in all packages purchased after May 16 includenew PostScript code that prints graduated fills up to 80 percent faster.andO;Still, before warned that the average printing time is two minutes.andP;  WithArtbeats' images, however, the result is worth the wait.andM;ClipablesandM;****C.A.R.'s Clipables ($149.95) is an enormous collection of EPS artwork,comprising some 600 images scattered across 17 disks a whopping 10 megabytesof data in all.andP;  Overall, this is a comprehensive, economical package withnicely drawn images.andP;  C.A.R.andP;  also plans to offer periodic supplements of 120to 200 images, and a CD-ROM disc with more than 2,000 images will appear inearly 1991.andM;As you might expect from a general-purpose library that tries to covereverything, Clipables is a broad but shallow package.andP;  Topics includeanimals, business, dingbats, mortises, people, holidays, humor, maps, sports,and transportation.andP;  The collection lacks computers, tools, and plant life,and you may sometimes wonder how C.A.R.andP;  made its choices.andP;  For example,Famous People is an odd assortment of five images: Einstein, GeorgeWashington, Santa Claus, Uncle Sam, and Nofretete [sic].andP;  The maps includeonly four of the seven continents, and the European map inexplicably includesonly Western Europe.andP;  You may wish C.A.R.andP;  had included more basic images andbagged a few extraneous ones, such as the  Dolphin Nymph and duplicatedimages of traffic stoplights and ladybugs.andP;  On the positive side, thewell-rounded sports section includes activities such as billiards, bowling,and fencing.andM;Image quality is quite good; drawing styles include line art, cartoons,silhouettes, and shaded renderings.andP;  Excellent drawings abound in thesections on chemistry, finance, and holidays, among others.andP;  A few images dohave an amateurish quality (dingbats come to mind), and there are occasionalflubs: a bald eagle in molt, a tacky turkey, and a gruesome Einstein.andP;  Thebusiness people have no facial features, which is disconcerting.andM;If you want to edit an image, you'll find that Clipables isn't as carefullyconceived as are some other collections.andP;  Image grouping is particularlyerratic.andP;  Some montages are subgrouped for easy separation and coloring,whereas elements of other images (pie-chart slices, countries on maps) aredifficult to manipulate.andP;  For example, most of the people are Caucasian, butif image elements aren't grouped, changing skin coloring can be a challenge.andO;In addition, the artwork suffers from occasional sloppiness.andP;  Some images areonly partially opaque-one businessman's face is opaque but parts of his handand shirt are transparent.andP;  The state maps' shadows vary in size fromnegligible to bizarrely large.andM;The manual is basic, but it includes pictures of all the images.andP;  There's noindex, which would have been invaluable in locating images in such a vastcollection.andP;  Although Clipables may not meet your every need, few othercollections offer so much, in both quantity and quality, for so little.andP;  Wethink it's worth the investment.andM;MacGalleryandM;****Dream Maker Software, which markets the Cliptures series of EPS artwork, alsooffers a modest MacPaint package called MacGalleryandM;49.95 .andP;  This whimsical collection is definitely not business-oriented;instead, it's ideal for children's publications, newsletters, fliers,invitations, and announcements.andP;  The more than 400 images are all originalillustrations and include holidays, food, sports, borders, phrases, mortises,animals, plants, and babies.andM;As always, there are images that fall outside the standard categories.andP;  InMacGallery's case, it's teddy bears, dinosaurs, and cartoon arms and legs (56of them!) for &quot;enhancing&quot; other images.andP;  The Christmas images include figuresfrom the Nutcracker Suite.andP;  You also get four pieces of presized stationery:a greeting card, a three-fold mailer, a business card, and a certificate.andM;MacGallery has a nice manual that's loaded with advice on working withMacPaint images, including tips for overlaying images, showing motion,duplicating and inverting images, creating shadows, and working with borders.andO;Although MacGallery is not as extensive as some other packages, it's a nicestarter collection of MacPaint clip art, especially if you work withchildren.andM;WetPaintandM;*****If you need massive quantities of well-drawn MacPaint graphics, take a lookat Dubl-Click's ten-volume WetPaint series ($79.95 per volume).andP;  Thebest-seller is Classic Clip Art, an enormous collection that's sure to havesomething for everyone, with art styles ranging from line drawings todigitized images.andP;  Contentwise, For Publishing is a bit more hit-and-miss,but Animal Kingdom has a good selection of wildlife plus hunting and campingimages.andP;  Special Occasions covers all the holidays and includes a niceselection of religious artwork.andP;  The images have an &quot;antique&quot; look, anillustration style that's continued in the Printer's Helper, IndustrialRevolution, and Old Earth Almanac packages.andP;  Dubl-Click does an excellent jobof creating images reminiscent of the woodcuts and other old-fashionedartwork that adorns old books, dictionaries, and encyclopedias.andP;  There's aunique package called MacTut ($49.95), a collection of ancient Egyptianartwork that includes a dozen ProGlyph hieroglyphic fonts.andP;  (The MacTutmanual provides instructions on creating cartouches, or Egyptian logos, andwriting messages in ancient Egyptian.)andM;The company returns to the modern world with its two most recent collections.andO;Island Life covers the tropical world, focusing on Australia and Hawaii.andP;  Allthe People shows all kinds of folks in all types of situations: children,famous people, office situations, occupations, ethnic and internationalbackgrounds, family and sports images, and even people in medieval garb.andO;Many images are drawn in a cartoon style, and some illustrations are modular- for example, you can assemble your own &quot;instant employee&quot; from providedbody parts.andP;  Unfortunately, the cartoon people all have the same facialexpression, which gets pretty stale.andM;As a nifty bonus, every WetPaint collection comes with two DAs.andP;  ArtRounduplets you open, scale, edit, and copy images among programs without using apaint application or a scrapbook.andP;  It also has a Slideshow feature that letsyou browse through multiple files without opening and closing each one.andO;Pattern Mover lets you copy and edit pattern palettes for MacPaint andFullPaint.andP;  When it comes to MacPaint clip art, WetPaint is one of the bestvalues around.andM;ClickArtandM;****T/Maker's ClickArt is the oldest and best-selling clip art for the Mac.andP;  TheClickArt library currently consists of six MacPaint packages ($49.95 each)and three EPS offerings ($129.95 each).andP;  All the MacPaint packages include aHyperCard stack of the images and a DA called ClipOut that lets you openfiles, edit the images, and then paste selections into other applications.andO;Although this isn't the most sophisticated MacPaint artwork on the market(Dubl-Click's WetPaint collections are arguably better), it serves mostpurposes quite well.andM;Business Images offers simple dingbat-type graphics such as arrows, logos,and flowchart symbols plus pictograms of people, animals, and equipment.andO;Personal Graphics and Publications contain a variety of images in assortedart styles.andP;  They're a bit unfocused but could be useful for fliers,invitations, and newsletters.andP;  Publications includes some nice illustratedhead lines and decorative alphabets.andP;  The Holidays collection covers theusual events, although it's not as complete as some other vendors' offerings.andO;If you require religious art, take a look at the Christian Images collection($59.95).andP;  T/Maker's latest -- and finest - MacPaint release is BusinessCartoons.andP;  All the images were drawn by award-winning cartoonist Phil Frank,who created the comic strips &quot;Farley&quot; and &quot;Miles to Go,&quot; and they have asophisticated, editorial-page look (below left).andP;  Subjects include people,office situations, finance, headlines, cartoon balloons, and monsters (ourfavorite).andM;On the EPS side, a majority of the images have sharp, clean lines, withjudicious use of shading and fills.andP;  The graphics are not subgrouped, so youcan't easily separate, say, a baby penguin from its mother.andP;  The images arealso unnecessarily small, forcing you to enlarge them several times to do anyediting.andP;  In addition, not all the images are opaque, leading to unexpectedbackground bleed-throughs.andM;EPS Business Art has some 200 images, with the emphasis on office supplies,equipment, dingbats, and occupational symbols.andP;  There are few images ofpeople or office settings, which could limit its usefulness unless you needpictures of staplers or fax machines.andP;  EPS Illustrations contains asmattering of everything, including a barbecue grill, coat hangers, and aPorsche.andP;  The newest collection is EPS Animals andamp; Nature.andP;  This is a nicelydone collection, although the image quality is uneven.andP;  Some drawings, suchas those of a fish and a pig, are inexplicably crude, whereas others aresuperb renderings of plants and animals, both modern and prehistoric.andP;  Thecollection also includes nature-inspired borders and dingbats plus imagesrelated to weather and the solar system.andM;The ClickArt manuals contain image thumbnails (some images, particularly inthe MacPaint collections, are almost too small to see) with helpful tips andan alphabetized index of filenames.andP;  Unfortunately, you frequently can't seeall the subtleties of detail and shading, leading you to think the art issimpler than it really is.andM;Images with impact: Accents andamp; BordersandM;*****3G Graphics has a reputation for producing high-quality EPS artwork, and itslatest Images with Impact offering is no exception.andP;  Accents andamp; Borders($129.95) contains 270 design elements, including borders, frames, ornaments,and labels (mortises) plus symbols for education, entertainment, food,holidays, sports, and more.andP;  Many frames have matching ornaments, and thereare five Designer Sets, each of which contains complementary bars, boxes, andtiles.andP;  (Minor semantic quibble: These elements are called borders, frames,and ornaments elsewhere in the collection.)andM;The illustrations are simply superb, with styles ranging from natural andhistorical to geometric and contemporary.andP;  The art is in crispblack-and-white, but registered users receive a color bonus disk with stillmore images, including a beautiful stained-glass border (bottom right) andsome delightful fish and Christmas lights.andP;  All the images are opaque, andmost are strategically subgrouped, allowing you to separate them into stillmore elements or apply color to an entire related area simultaneously all theleaves in a border, for example).andP;  You can easily resize continuous frameswithout affecting their thickness by removing chunks from their lengths andwidths.andP;  The ornaments, like those that come in the first Adobe Collector'sEdition, are extremely versatile and can serve as frame corners, brackets,dividers, or text accents.andM;A pictorial directory shows all the art printed at high resolution, and theexcellent user's manual is loaded with tips and techniques for handling,combining, and customizing the art.andP;  There's even a section explaining  thehistorical significance of the art styles.andP;  With Accents andamp; Borders, 3GGraphics has once again scored a bull's-eye.andP;  The quality and variety of thispackage make it an unbeatable value.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
