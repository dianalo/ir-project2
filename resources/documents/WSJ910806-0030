Robert P. Casey, a Democrat, signed the budget billSunday night, restoring pay to thousands of state workers whohaven't received full pay since the fiscal year began July 1.As it ended the fiscal year, Pennsylvania had a budgetdeficit of $454 million.   Meanwhile, in Connecticut, which also has been in caughtup in a budget crisis, the General Assembly passed its thirdbudget plan without an income tax, voting instead to raiseother taxes and fees by $740 million. Gov. Lowell P. Weicker,who has been determined to implement an income tax, said hewould take several days to review the budget plan beforedeciding whether to veto it, sign it, or let it become lawwithout his stamp on it.   Some Connecticut lawmakers noted that the new budget wassimilar to two previous budgets the governor already hadvetoed. Gov. Weicker issued an executive order to keep thestate government running for another week. The state has beenwithout a budget since July 1.   Concerning the Pennsylvania budget, Doug Saltzman, managerof governmental affairs for the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber ofCommerce, estimated that the budget bill will cost businessesan additional $1.7 billion in new taxes and increase thecorporate net income tax rate to 12.25% from 8.5%.   Clifford Jones, president of the Pennsylvania Chamber ofBusiness and Industry, criticized the governor and lawmakersfor failing to make spending cuts and then collaborating toimpose unduly &quot;punitive&quot; tax increases. He said thegeneral-fund tax package actually will collect more taxesthan lawmakers have estimated, closer to $4 billion than thestated $2.85 billion.   &quot;We're now the highest business tax state in the nationand maybe in the world,&quot; Mr. Jones said. &quot;It may drive somepeople out.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
