The resultsfrom this study indicate that elevated temperatures and contact withatmospheric oxygen accelerate the chemical reactions without changingtheir direction or the ratios among the products that are formed. A 10{sup0}C increase in temperature, as usual, doubles the rate of the chemicalreactions. The data shown also confirm the influence of temperature onthe rate of chemical conversions of ethylcellosolve during storage in200-liter steel drums in unheated buildings in different climatic zones.</TEXT></DOC>
