The pact is with Balboa Business Credit, a Los Angeles leasing unit of closely held Balboa Group, Woodland Hills, Calif. Under terms, ASK will make and market natural gas-powered cogeneration power systems designed to produce electricity at less cost than a utility would charge a small business. Waco, Texas-based ASK, formerly American Solar King Corp., makes energy-production products.    Balboa will evaluate the credit of ASK's potential customers and finance the installation of the equipment, according to Richard L. Redman, Balboa Business's executive vice president. Balboa said Ford Motor Co.'s credit subsidiary would provide funding to Balboa for the ASK agreement. </TEXT></DOC>
