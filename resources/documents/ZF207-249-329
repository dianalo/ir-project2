 AlthoughMCA is not yet developed to its potential, it makes an effectiveinvestment for future connectivity.andP;  Novell's NetWare is alsolikely to survive LAN Manager's debut, primarily because of itslarge installed base.andP;  It will likely be the basis for a futuredivision of both DOS and OS-2 networks running side by side.andO;Communications software is at its best running in the backgroundwhile other applications are being performed.andP;  The column'ssupport for file-server-based internal tape drives, however, iswithdrawn.andP;  Tape drives in workstations provide better backupsecurity.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Product:   LAN Manager (Computer network software) (marketing)NetWare (Computer network software) (marketing).andO;Topic:     Micro Channel ArchitectureExtended Industry Standard ArchitectureOS-2File ServersReview of Past YearTape DrivesMarket PenetrationNetwork Management Software.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Writing a weekly column in this fast-paced business can be quite a challenge:Something which looks good one week may very well be outdated the next.andP;  Tocrib the title of David Mamet's latest movie, ''Things Change.''andM;After rereading a year's worth of columns, four major issues need someclarification: support for the Micro Channel, the role of OS/2 networks, theefficacy of background communications and internal tape drives in servers.andM;Perhaps the biggest flap has been over my support of the Micro Channel forfile servers, mentioned in a series of columns beginning June 28.andP;  I stillstand by my support of the MCA, especially in light of the vapor-bus calledExtended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA).andP;  EISA representativesthemselves are on record saying the existing AT bus isn't going to make itfor high-performance file servers.andM;However, some of the issues I mentioned this summer aren't so clear-cut: IBMhas had its own problems with PS/2 reliability, and Compaq and AST Research(among others) have split memory and input/output bus implementations, too.andM;One caveat: Readers shouldn't confuse the architecture of MCA with itspresent implementation.andP;  As shown this fall at Comdex, there's a lot moremeat behind the MCA.andP;  But in the meantime, you should at least use a '386machine -- PS/2 or not -- as your server.andM;On to another issue: OS/2 networks.andP;  We certainly spilled lots of ink overthis topic, but ignored some important issues: First, that NetWare isn'tgoing to disappear overnight.andP;  Novell has a good product and a hefty chunk ofthe market.andP;  Neither will go away without a fight from userland.andM;Second, now that OS/2 networks are actually being shipped, analysts(including myself) should look carefully at the products from the actual OS/2LAN vendors.andP;  In the past we've clouded the issue by talking aboutMicrosoft's LAN Manager, which is not available in stores.andM;A third OS/2 LAN issue, and somewhat related, is that IBM, 3Com and otherOS/2 networking vendors have put together some quality auto-installationprograms.andP;  You put the disk in, you answer some fairly basic questions andyou follow the prompts.andP;  Before you know it, megabytes of software are livingon your hard disk.andM;So, no, it won't take a degree in computer science to install OS/2 (as I saidrather cynically on Oct.andP;  31), but it will take some smarts to change theconfiguration once installed.andM;A final OS/2 issue is that mixed DOS and OS/2 networks are possible, and canwork well.andP;  There are some tricky things to consider, such as what servicesgo on which type of file servers, and how to handle other ''administrivia.''andO;However, these are minor.andP;  The 3Com folks have done a good job here, and it'stime I said so.andM;In a column on background communications that ran on Sept.andP;  26, I mentionedthat I was not a big fan of Lotus' Express.andM;Since then, I've become a daily user, accustomed to its quirks, and now Icommunicate with MCI Mail exclusively through Express.andP;  As a result, my copyof Crosstalk has grown a bit stale on my hard disk.andM;Express is not without its problems, though.andP;  First, the software doesn'tlike being resident with the software that runs the Intel fax board.andP;  Sosometimes the fax board will answer the phone, whether I want it to or not.andO;Second, I miss the reassurance of interactive MCI, especially withhard-to-spell names.andM;I still think background communication is best for true multitaskingoperating systems like OS/2 and Unix.andP;  Given the problems with PC-DOS,Express is well-thought-out and useful.andM;Time for a final fling at tape-backup systems.andP;  Back on Feb.andP;  2, I mentionedthat the best place for a tape-backup drive was on a server, as an internalunit.andP;  I don't think so anymore.andP;  It makes more sense to put it on aworkstation: You buy redundancy (if the server goes completely south) andflexibility (you can make backups from anywhere on the network).andM;So I now vote for internal tape drives on workstations, not servers.andP;  I onlywish IBM would offer such an option.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
