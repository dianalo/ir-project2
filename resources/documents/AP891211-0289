Living standards fell sharply as an estimated $204 billionflowed out of the region, most to service a collective foreign debtof $430 billion.   ``The crisis Latin American nations are undergoing has a namewritten with capital letters _ FOREIGN DEBT,'' Venezuela PresidentCarlos Andres Perez said in March after anti-government riots inwhich 300 were killed and 2,000 injured.   ``Budget adjustments, austerity programs and economic stagnationhave made the 1980s the lost decade,'' Miguel de la Madrid, thenMexico's president, said at a Latin summit last year.   During the 1970s, borrowing spurred economic developmentthroughout the region, most notably in Brazil's so-called miracleof double-digit annual growth and low inflation.   Railroads, steel mills, copper mines, hydroelectric dams,nuclear power plants, airports, highways, ports and subways wereconstructed from Mexico's U.S. frontier thousands of miles south toArgentina, the last stop before Antarctica.   Development seemed to accompany democracy, as civilians replacedsoldiers in Honduras in 1981, Bolivia in 1982, Argentina in 1983,Brazil and Uruguay in 1985.   Borrowing grew on a large scale, despite a steady rise ininterest rates and shrinkage of trade surpluses. It continuedalmost to the moment Mexico and Brazil _ the biggest Third Worlddebtors _ were forced to suspend repayments.   That development in mid-1982 set off shock waves in corporateboardrooms and government corridors, and prompted projections of arupture in the world banking system.   While that did not happen, the rest of the decade was filledwith bitter sparring between bankers and bureaucrats, the formertrying to dam the flow of red ink and the latter juggling creditneeds against a rising tide of malnutrition, illiteracy andhomelessness.   The average per-capita income of an Argentine was $1,990 in1980, and $360 less in 1988, World Bank figures show. Mexico'sgross national product shrank for seven straight years. Real wagesin Venezuela have slipped by one-third since 1981, and now areestimated at the 1964 level.   Chile, which under the rightist regime of President Gen. AugustoPinochet pursued policies of export expansion and a balanced budgetahead of most neighbors, was not as badly hurt.   Colombia, Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay, and until this yearVenezuela, which has huge oil deposits, usually fulfilled theirdebt obligations on time, albeit with difficulty as world commodityprices plunged.   Peru is a special case. President Alan Garcia capped debtrepayment at 10 percent of export earnings, a move that shut thecountry out of international credit markets. Explosive growth wasfollowed by hyperinflation and recession.   In most Latin countries, debt repayments during the 1980s tookup ever larger shares of national budgets, leaving less money forpublic housing, schools, hospitals. Argentina alloted 20 percent ofits budget to education in 1972 and only 6 percent in 1986.   Roads deteriorated. Completion of Yacyreta Dam in Argentina, oneof the largest construction projects in the world, was postponed.Work on Xingo Dam, the biggest public project under way in Brazil,was halted in October.   Investment dried up. Today's factories are obsolete. A droughtthat shifted electricity production to coal- and oil-firedgenerators resulted in brownouts in Argentina and Uruguay earlierthis year. Nine of every 10 cars in Mexico are at least 5 years old.   By printing money in part to pay the debt, Latin nations broughton devaluations, ruinous inflation and recession. Three monthsafter the rioting in Venezuela this year, hungry Argentines sackedfood stores in cities surrounded by wheat fields, dairy farms andsome of the world's most fertile cropland.   Brazilian presidential candidate Luis Inacio da Silva reflectedthe emotions _ and rhetoric _ the debt issue can generate when hesaid during his campaign leading up to national elections on Nov.15:   ``The Third World War has already started. ... It is a war bythe United States against the Latin American continent and theThird World. It is war over the foreign debt, one which has as itsmain weapon interest (payments), a weapon more deadly than theatomic bomb.''   As the decade ends, a resolution seems closer than at any timesince 1982.   Latin leaders talk less of moratoriums and acknowledge that manyof their economic problems are the result not of the debt but ofgovernment fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies.   Much of the debt was spent to balance budgets, subsidize foodprices, maintain unrealistic exchange rates and buy militaryweapons, they acknowledge, rather than to create an infrastructurethat would repay it.   Billions of dollars were squandered in bribes, kickbacks,illegal commissions and graft. Perhaps too much money was borrowed.   Jose Angel Gurria, Mexico's main debt negotiator, said, ``It'sindispensable not to forget the lessons of our own history andrecent past. We cannot repeat the error of taking on excessivedebt.''   Brazil's total current debt is $110 billion. Mexico owes $107.4billion; Argentina, $65 billion; Venezuela, $35 billion. They arethe four biggest debtors in the developing world.   Bankers now seem to agree that economic growth must precederepayment, and that much of the debt is unpayable, as Latin leadershave argued for years.   Lending institutions are accepting proposals they once resisted:lower interest rates, deferred principal payments, debt-equityswaps, outright forgiveness. Meanwhile, governments of manycountries are selling off state-owned enterprises and givingcapitalism a chance.   John Reed, chairman of Citibank, said he is optimistic thatearly in the 1990s the debt ``crisis'' will abate. Latin countrieswill have easier access to international credit, he predicted, andbanks will be paid what they are owed.   Reed cited Mexico's recent agreement with creditors to exchangedebt for 30-year bonds, and Venezuela's offer to set aside oilrevenues as collateral to banks willing to write down their loans.   Late in 1989, even defiant Peru said it would resume payments onoverdue loans to the International Monetary Fund.   When the Mexican debt relief plan was announced last July,President Carlos Salinas de Gortari voiced the hope of all who hadstruggled with the problem:   ``The result does not mean that by magic our problems haveceased to exist. ... we will have to keep working, but each daywill be a little better.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Yearend Editions</NOTE></DOC>
