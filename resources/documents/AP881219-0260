It has brought out both the best in management skill, theworst in Wall Street greed and the concern of lawmakers.   ``There's something seriously wrong when there's more of anincentive for corporate managers to liquidate their own companiesfor their own personal financial benefit than there is an incentivefor them to make the company more competitive,'' said Edward D.Markey, D-Mass., one of several legislators expected to conducthearings into leveraged buyouts in 1989.   Ironically, most ordinary American families probably don't evennotice how increased corporate debt is part of their daily routine.Like an invisible gas, the leveraging of U.S. companies is subtle,silent, gradual, everywhere.   If they shop at Safeway, read TV Guide, rent a car from Avis, buyDolly Madison paper towels, shave with a Gillette Trac II, orderGoodyear radials for the car or install an American Standardbathtub, some of their spending money goes to pay down an enormouslyincreased corporate debt.   That's only a result of some of the biggest deals. The vastmajority of debt-financed restructurings affects smaller companiesrarely mentioned in the news but just as much a part of everydayAmerican life.   For example, cheerleader uniforms supplied to most schools comefrom Cheerleader Group Inc., a company formed from a $46 million LBOengineered last June. Ten Midwest states use fire hydrants suppliedby Water Products Co., which underwent a $20 million management-leddebt restructuring in December.   Despite the growing clamor about where all this debt is leading,there are passionate defenders of LBOs who say the concept of debtis widely misunderstood. In their view, debt is a tool, a way toexploit money to maximum advantage, and should not be viewed as athreat.   ``One of the biggest missing ingredients in Congress right now isinformation and understanding about LBOs,'' said Henry Kravis,principal of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., a small but powerfulinvestment firm that is the undisputed leader of the technique.   ``We're not going to take the heart out of a corporation,'' hetold Fortune magazine in an interview. ``People who produce thingswill stay. We look at the people who report to people who report topeople. We'll often cut fat at the corporate level.   ``There'd be much less of this, and companies would be valuedmore accurately, if chief executives felt the pressure from theirdirectors to do the cutting that they only do when they'rethreatened by a takeover.''   To a large degree, it was Kravis's firm that heightened thecontroversy over debt-financed takeovers. Its biggest triumph so faris the record $24.5 billion purchase of food-tobacco giant RJRNabisco Inc., announced Nov. 30 after a bidding brawl that someconsidered a symbol of corporate gluttony.   Many will be watching closely to see how RJR manages or evensurvives under a quadrupled debt load of $23 billion. Someforecasters believe Kohlberg's triumph also could become itsgreatest defeat and help sour corporate America's appetite forborrowed money.   ``The Revco D.S. bankruptcy was a warning,'' said Robert H. Rock,president of the Philadelphia-based business information firm MLREnterprises Inc., in the December issue of Corporate Restructuring,an industry newsletter. ``The RJR Nabisco deal may lead us closer tothe brink.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Yearend Editions</NOTE></DOC>
