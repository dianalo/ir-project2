Background</ITAG>Section 1903(r) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires the Medicaidprogram in most States to have in place a mechanized claims processingand information retrieval system as described in section 1903(a) of theAct. Section 1903(a) authorizes Federal matching funds at 75 percent forthe operation of such a system, as long as it remains approved by HCFA.The system is popularly known as the Medicaid Management Information System,or MMIS. The purpose of this system is to provide for an effective, efficientand economical administration of the State Medicaid plans.Section 1903(r) requires us to review each system at least once every threeyears to determine whether it meets our performance standards and systemsrequirements. Systems failing the system performance review (SPR) are subjectto a reduction in Federal matching funds. States must be informed of anychange in performance standards by the June 30th preceding the beginningof the Federal fiscal year in which we intend to apply the standards. Wepublished the first set of performance standards on June 30, 1981 (46 FR33653); there have been no other publications changing the performancestandards.The performance standards currently are statements of desired outcomes.They are made up of subordinate activities or specific tasks capable ofdirect measurement. Each standard consists of one or more elements, which,in turn, consist of two or more factors. The factors, which are very specificactivities, are revised from year to year as needed.In measuring performance under the current SPR we use a tiered scoringsystem. The MMIS must pass every standard in order to pass the SPR. Inaddition, the MMIS must receive a minimum score on each of the <T3>elements</T3> that make up the standard.Our experience has shown that the current SPR has a number of shortcomings.In some instances specific activities we wanted to measure as indicativeof the performance of the MMIS could not be logically classified underthe standards as they are formatted or could arguably be placed under morethan one standard. In other instances we felt it inappropriate to reviewactivities under a particular standard because shifting program emphasisindicated that priorities be placed in other areas.In June 1988, we notified State agencies of our intentions to revise theSPR and sent them a pilot SPR guide and solicited their comments. We arealso testing the pilot project in five states as of October 1, 1988; wewill review their systems against the proposed SPR.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Provisions of the Notice</ITAG>In order to improve measurement of MMIS performances, we looked at thethree components of the SPR: (1) The standards themselves as appropriatemeasures; (2) the application of the standards; that is, use of factorsand elements tied rigidly to particular standards; and (3) the scoringsystem.A. Performance StandardsWe propose to retain unchanged the seven performance standards as publishedon June 30, 1981. In addition, we propose to add a new standard number8, concerning third party liability, discussed below. The standards wouldconsist of the following:andbullet; Standard 1_Eligibility.An accurate system of recipient eligibility information must be provided.andbullet; Standard 2_Support files.An accurate and accessible system of files must be provided to supportsystem operations.andbullet; Standard 3_Orderly and timely claims processing.Claims must be processed in an orderly and timely manner from initial receiptthrough issuance of claims determinations.andbullet; Standard 4_Accurate claims processing and review.Claims data must be accurately processed and reviewed.andbullet; Standard 5_Management and Administrative Reporting Subsystem (MARS).The MARS must be efficiently and effectively operated in order to providesupport to the management review, evaluation, and decision-making processes.andbullet; Standard 6_Surveillance and Utilization Review Subsystem (SURS).The operation of a SURS must provide comprehensive health care deliveryand utilization data for program management, reveal defects in the qualityof care, and reveal suspected instances of provider or recipient fraudor abuse.andbullet; Standard 7_MMIS administration.Overall effectiveness in carrying out MMIS administrative responsibilitiesmust be demonstrated.andbullet; Standard 8_Third party liability (TPL).The MMIS must perform functions and provide data to support cost avoidanceand the collection of payments from liable third parties and to assurethat Medicaid is the payer of last resort.Section 1903(r)(6)(J) of the Act requires us to develop and disseminateperformance standards for assessing the State's third party collectionefforts in accordance with section 1902(a)(25)(A)(ii) of the Act. We proposeda standard that would accomplish this purpose and several elements on March3, 1987 (52 FR 6350) in a proposed rule concerning third-party liability.We received six comments from ten commenters on the TPL standard as proposed.All of the comments specifically addressed the proposed elements and notthe proposed standards. Since we are proposing to eliminate elements, asdiscussed below, we are not responding to these comments. Proposed newstandard 8 is essentially the same as included in our March 3, 1987, proposedrule, with only minor editorial changes.B. Elements and FactorsThe elements, as currently worded, are specifically written to measurethe standards to which they are tied. Factors, in a similar fashion, aretied directly to the elements. We often find that the current system isinflexible as we develop new factors that measure a standard but do notmeasure any particular element. We also find that with shifting emphasessome elements are no longer relevant, and, hence, have subordinate factors,that, similarly, are no longer appropriate to the given elements.In order to correct the problems, we considered two possibilities: (1)Drop the current standards or elements (or both) and replace them withnew categories that more accurately encompass the activities we wish toreview; (2) abandon the use of categorization altogether. In consideringthe former option there was concern that new categories might appear perfectlyworkable now (just as the standards and elements did in 1981), but thatthey too could eventually become irrelevant. Furthermore, any ongoing ofreview factors would tend to continue separate scoring of the groups, anotion that we feel is not essential. Therefore, we propose to abandonclassification of factors altogether.We believe that measuring accomplishments in terms of factors would accuratelydetermine whether a system meets performance standards. We do not blievethat measurement of accomplishments in terms of elements is necessary orefficient or improves accuracy of what needs to be measured. We proposeto delete the elements from the SPR.The factors would not be directly associated with any particular standards;i.e., passing a given standard would not depend on passing a given groupingof factors.Most of the factors that we intend to use in the SPR would be identicalto those used in past SPRs. Factors are developed based on communicationbetween the State agencies and HCFA. These factors are the accomplishments,outcomes, or purchases that we have determined promote the efficiency,effectiveness, and economy of the MMIS. States are given the factors andHCFA's expectations for performance levels that are necessary to pass thefactors in the yearly SPR review package that is issued to States in June.In order that commenters may evaluate the effect of our proposal, we havelisted a number of illustrative factors. After them, in parentheses, wealso list the numbers of the standards as they appear in section II.A.of this document to which the factor might apply.<ITAG tagnum="16">Illustrative Factor_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">The claims processing eligibility file must be updated with currentrecipient eligibility information at least once every 10 calendar days.(Stardards 1, 7, 8) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Illustrative Factor_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Updates to the formulary pricing file and/or medical procedure feeschedule must be made accurately and timely.

(Standards 1, 2, 4, 8) </ITAG>C. Scoring System Under the new percentage scoring system, the sum of all factors (the finalcumulative percentage score), would never exceed 100 percent. The systemwould determine the percent correct for each factor and would multiplythat figure by a weight (either 1, 2, or 3) and a feature called a multiplier,which reflect the factors relative importance within the SPR. Then thesystem would add all the weighted factor scores together to produce a finalcumulative percentage score for the SPR. We believe that certain factors are so critical that it is important thatthe States achieve an acceptable level of performance for these factors.Therefore, we would designate a small number of factors as critical. Thesefactors would get a higher weight than non-critical factors. We propose,a pool of potential critical factors from which we intend to choose atleast five critical factors, the following: andbullet; The MMIS must pay claims accurately; i.e., at the State approvedfee or rate. andbullet; The MMIS must determine if institutional claims are paid accurately;i.e., at the State-approved fee or rate. andbullet; The MMIS must monitor the frequency with which clean practitionerclaims are paid or denied timely; i.e., within 30 days of receipt. andbullet; The MMIS must monitor the frequency with which clean practitionerclaims are paid or denied timely; i.e., within 90 days of receipt. andbullet; The MMIS must assure that edits are properly utilized in the processingof Medicaid claims. andbullet; The MMIS must use duplicate detection edits and system logic sufficientto detect duplicate claims in all major claim categories; i.e., inpatient,outpatient, laboratory and x-ray, long term care, physician services anddrugs. andbullet; The MMIS must monitor the frequency with which claims other thanclean practitioner claims are paid timely; i.e., within 30 days of receipt.To be reapproved, each MMIS would have to achieve the above mentioned minimumcumulative percentage score and pass all critical factors. the State agencieswould be notified of the designated critical factors by the June 30th precedingthe beginning of the review period in which they are effective. This notificationalso would include the minimum acceptable performance levels (APLs) forall factors and those APLs would be used for producing the final cumulativepercentage score. We propose a reasonable number of factors to be 36, the total value ofwhich would equal 100 percent. Of the 36 factors, at least five from theabove pool would be identified as critical. A minimum cumulative percentagescore would be established at 90 percent, and a minimum factor score (APL)of 90 percent would be established for each critical factor. If the minimumcumulative percentage score meets or exceeds 90 percent and the minimumfactor score for each critical factor meets or exceeds 90 per cent, thesystem would be reapproved. This departs from the current scoring system. the cumulative score wasdetermined on a standard and element level for purposes of reapproval ordisapproval. Under the proposed revisions we would eliminate scoring onthe standard and element level. With our departure from rigidly association each factor with one standard,and our proposal to score only the factors, the review and scoring wouldoperate as outlined below. By June 30 preceding the beginning of the review period to be evaluated,we would send States the following information:andbullet; All the factors to be used in the SPR. (Some factors might notapply to all States, depending on the State's particular system). andbullet; The relative weight applicable to each factor (we anticipate weightsof 1, 2, or 3). The total score of all factors, after weighting and applicationof the multiplier, will never exceed 100 percent. andbullet; The identification of factors designated as critical and the minimumAPL for each critical factor. andbullet; The minimum final cumulative percentage score needed to pass theSPR. The review would be conducted for each individual factor. We would assessthe State's performance under each factor and note the percentage of correctactivities. For purposes of the final cumulative percentage score, eachfactor's percentage score would be weighted using the factor weight andmultiplier, then added together to calculate overall performance. For criticalfactors the individual factor's percentage correct would be used to determineif the factor meets the minimum APL. In some instances HCFA may determine that a factor is inapplicable to aState's MMIS. The weights assigned to factors that are inapplicable ina given State are excluded from the total of all the factor weights, andthe total weighting and multipliers are readjusted so that maximum finalcumulative percentage score is again 100 percent. In summary, if the State agency achieves at least the minimum cumulativepercentage score and passes all critical factors, its MMIS would be reapproved.If it fails to achieve the minimum score or fails one or more criticalfactors, its MMIS would be disapproved. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Availability of SPR Package </ITAG>Anyone wishing to obtain a copy of the SPR package (for information orcomment) that HCFA currently uses in several States to test the new scoringformat may obtain it by addressing a request for it to: Frederick Harris,273 EHR Bldg., HCFA, BQC, 6325 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21207. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Impact Statement </ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291 Executive Order 12291 (E.OI. 12291) requires us to prepare and publisha regulatory impact analysis for any proposed notice that meets one ofthe E.O. criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely toresult in_ andbullet; An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;andbullet; A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographicregions; orandbullet; Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.One potential impact of the changes this notice proposes is that a Stateagency may fail the SPR even though it currently passes it, or it may passunder the proposed scoring system although it currently fails it. WhileState Medicaid agencies with systems failing the SPR would be subject toa reduction in Federal matching funds, 42 CFR 433.113(b) requires thatonly a proportion of that part of a State's FFP that pertains to expendituresfor compensation and training of skilled professional medical personneland support staff and for general administration would be reduced. We havedetermined that neither these potential reductions nor any other effectsfrom this proposed notice would meet any of the criteria of the ExecutiveOrder 12291. Thus, a regulatory impact analysis is not required. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistentwith the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unlessthe Secretary certifies that a proposed notice would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposesof the RFA, all providers and suppliers are treated as small entities.This proposed notice would not have a direct effect on providers and suppliers;however, it is possible that some of the standards may have an indirecteffect on them. For example, a State agency's attempts to meet these standardsmay produce a more efficient process for eligibility determinations andorderly and timely claims processing. We would expect these indirect effectsto be positive for providers and suppliers; however we do not expect theseeffects to be significant. For these reasons, we have determined, and theSecretary certifies, that this proposed notice would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. We have, therefore,not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis. C. Rural Hospital Impact Statement Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatoryimpact analysis if a proposed notice may have a significant impact on theoperations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysismust conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposesof section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospitalwith fewer than 50 beds located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area.We are not preparing a rural impact statement since we have determinedand the Secretary certifies that this proposed notice would not have asignificant economic impact on the operations of a substantial number ofsmall rural hospitals. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Paperwork Burden </ITAG>These changes do not impose paperwork collection requirements. Consequently,they need not be reviewed by the Executive Office Management and Budgetunder the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3801et seq.). <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Response to Comments </ITAG>Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receiveon a proposed rule, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually.However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date andtime specified in the ``Date'' section of this preamble, and, if we proceedwith a final notice, we will respond to the comments in the preamble ofthat notice.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Section 1903(r) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396b(r))</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program No. 13.714), MedicalAssistance)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 5, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Louis B.
