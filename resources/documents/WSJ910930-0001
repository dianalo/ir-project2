The article was inaccurateand potentially harmful to a region already beset bylong-term economic problems.   Early in August, the Massachusetts Energy Facility SitingCouncil, probably a more objective and expert source ofinformation, approved construction of a 300-megawattcogeneration facility in New Bedford, Mass., by EasternEnergy Corp. Approval was based largely on the council'sdetermination that New England will require at least 300megawatts additional power capacity beginning in 1995.</LP><TEXT>   What the council no doubt recognized is the need forlong-term assessment of energy needs. There's no questionthat New England's aging power plants will continue to bedecommissioned in the next decade. At the same time,notwithstanding the temporary dip in electricity demandcaused by the recession, continued longterm economic growthand development will inexorably require more generatingcapacity.   It is critical that we plan responsibly for the futurethrough construction of fuel-efficient, environmentally soundpower plants. Conservation is unquestionably an importantpart of energy strategy. CLF's goal of completely eliminatingnew power facility construction, however, is a prescriptionfor regional energy disaster.   Howard F Bovers   President   Newbay Corp.   Rockland, Mass.
