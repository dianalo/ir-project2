<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-38-1466 </DOCNO><TEXT>A two step synthesis route has been elaborated for the preparation ofYBaxCu/sub 1.5/xO/sub z/ superconductor series. It has been shown thatthe Ba/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 5/ double metal oxide, prepared in the firststep, is essential in formation of YBa/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 9-d/ andsharply differs from any other proposed barium cuprate. A wide compositionrange from x=2 to 17 was prepared from this compound by addition of Y/sub2/O/sub 3/ without disappearance of superconductivity. Resistivity measurementshint at existence of two superconducting phases. ESR investigations revealedon a baseline hysteresis, depending on the actual value of x. (author).53 refs, 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
