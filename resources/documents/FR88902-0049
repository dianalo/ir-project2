In the course ofreviewing the testing protocol for the recombinant derived live pseudorabiesvirus vaccine, APHIS assessed the impact on the human environment of authorizingthe manufacturer to conduct field testing of the product in five Statesas set forth in the environmental assessment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact providesthe public with documentation of APHIS' review and analysis of environmentaleffects which may be associated with the gathering of information in theselimited field trials.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. Genetic engineering procedures were employed to facilitate two genedeletions in the pseudorabies virus (PRV) genome. One deletion destroyedthe viral thymidine kinase (tk) gene which is required for the virus toreplicate in the host's central nervous sytem and hence cause infectionand disease. A second deletion destroyed a gene coding for a viral coatglycoprotein (gIII), thus allowing vaccinated animals to be distinguishedfrom those infected with PR virus from other sources.2. The recombinant derived pseudorabies vaccine virus was shown to be avirulentand yet fully capable of eliciting an immune response that protects pigsfrom the PRV, but unable to evoke antibodies to gIII which allows the differentiationbetween infected pigs and vaccinated ones.3. Transmission of the vaccine virus derived from recombinant DNA techniquescould not be demonstrated in that vaccine virus was not detected from nasalswabs taken from vaccinated pigs or from sentinel animals which were heldas nonvaccinated controls. All sentinel animals remained fully susceptibleto challenge with wild-type PRV.4. Vaccination by the recombinant vaccine reduces replication and sheddingof wild-type virus that could subsequently infect other animals in theherd. Therefore, the vaccine will reduce the dissemination of the virulentwild-type virus into the environment.5. The tk gene deletion is a stable characteristic of the vaccine viruswith a probability of reversion being essentially zero.6. The wild-type PRV is found widely distributed in nature and it doesnot contain an oncongene or cancer-causing substance. Because the recombinantderived virus does not contain any new genetic information there is nolikelihood of it being oncogenic.7. The wild-type PRV is not considered pathogenic to man. Since the recombinantvaccine only differs from wild-type PRV by two deletions, it is also considerednonpathogenic to man.8. The recombinant derived modified live virus vaccine was shown to besafe in safety and efficacy studies which were carried out in isolation.The results of these experiments demonstrate that the vaccine is safe andeffective in a variety of laboratory animal model systems.Based on the foregoing, APHIS has determined that the field testing ofthe recombinant derived modified live pseudorabies virus vaccine wouldhave no significant impact on the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact has beenprepared in accordance with (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>); (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (Title 40, Code of FederalRegulations (CFR) Parts 1500-1508); (3) USDA regulations implementing NEPA(7 CFR Part 1b); and (4) APHIS guidelines implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384and 44 FR 51272-51274).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 30th day of August, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
