For several years, Britain has urged the U.S. to ban the use by individual states of unitary corporate taxation methods. Under those methods, taxes are calculated according to a formula-determined share of a company's world-wide earnings rather than basing liability on operations within a state or country's geographical jurisdiction. British companies have complained that the method results in double taxation and heavy compliance costs and have lobbied heavily against its use by states in the U.S.    A 1985 law gave the British government authority to retaliate against U.S. companies based in states using unitary tax methods, but the British postponed the provision until Dec. 31, 1986, after the U.S. federal government began moving toward national legislative action. The measures would have allowed Britain to withdraw tax credits related to dividends paid by British units of companies based in states using unitary taxation.    But Washington dropped the legislative initiative after California, the major remaining user of unitary tax methods, modified its use of the method in September.    Britain said it isn't completely satisfied with the California law because of fees required of companies wishing to switch from unitary taxation, and unitary-tax laws are still on the books in Alaska, Montana and North Dakota. Britain said it still wants national action against the method, but the British Treasury said it won't take action &quot;for the present.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
