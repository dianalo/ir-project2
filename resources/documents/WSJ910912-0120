But given themany thinly disguised plugs the author gives toplastics-based packaging, it appears Mr. Taylor's mainmission was to tout a particular packaging material.   In short, paper is done a disservice by his inartfulmanipulation of philosophical arguments on overregulation togain readers' attention and ply them with misleadingstatements in support of plastics.</LP><TEXT>   For instance, referring to a Franklin Associates report asevidence, Mr. Taylor incorrectly indicates that paperboardmilk containers generate more solid waste than their plasticcounterparts. In truth, the report he cites found that a64-ounce paperboard milk container occupies 21% less volumein a landfill than the same size plastic container, while a128-ounce paperboard container occupies 5% less space.   Mr. Taylor also conveniently neglects to mention thatpaperboard milk containers are significantly lessfossil-fuel-intensive than plastic containers. His claim thatpaperboard yields more air and water pollution is withoutmerit, since such comparisons are based on weight. Looking atthe relevant issue -- toxicological impacts -- paper isclearly better for the environment.   He also says polystyrene cups do not require trees to becut down. But the relevant point is that their manufactureconsumes more fossil fuel than do paper cups. And, whiletrees are being replanted at a much more rapid rate thanharvested, to my knowledge no one has yet discovered a meansof replacing fossil fuels.
