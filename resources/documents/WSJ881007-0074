In the third quarter of 1987, Chase earned $226 million, or $2.55 a share.    For 1988's first six months, the holding company for Chase Manhattan Bank reported net income of $501 million, or $5.53 a share; in the second quarter, net was $224 million, or $2.45 a share.    Earlier this week, in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing relating to a proposed preferred-stock offering, Chase said that &quot;in light of continuing uncertainties regarding Argentina,&quot; added amounts of credit to borrowers there &quot;could be placed in nonaccrual status.&quot;    Of $970 million of Chase loans outstanding to borrowers in Argentina at June 30, $60 million had been on a nonaccrual basis.    Placement of loans on a nonaccrual basis means that income from such loans is recognized only when payments are received. Under U.S. regulations, banks are required to put a loan on nonaccrual 90 days after interest payments are missed.    Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., a securities-rating concern, recently estimated that seven of the largest U.S. bank holding companies have about $6.3 billion of Argentinean loans on their books. Manufacturers Hanover Corp. tops the list with $1.5 billion, and Citicorp is second with $1.4 billion.    In the SEC filing, Chase also disclosed that it has received about $180 million of past-due interest from Brazil. Chase is scheduled to receive an additional $180 million of interest in the fourth quarter.    The interest payments from Brazil relate to a commercial-bank financing plan signed last month. The settlement between Brazil and its creditor banks reschedules $62 billion of foreign bank debt and gives Brazil a new $5.2 billion loan and a guarantee of at least $15 billion in trade credits. </TEXT></DOC>
