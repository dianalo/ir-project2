Some blameit on religion. In fact, on Capitol Hill these days, membersof Congress are blaming the House Bank scandal on just abouteverything but the bossa nova.   In the coming weeks, fully two-thirds of the House -- 296members -- will have to explain to their constituents whythey had overdrafts at the now-defunct House Bank. So far,many of the explanations are real eyebrow-raisers.</LP><TEXT>   Consider Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, a Democrat of Ohio. Shesays she always thought she had to put her money in the HouseBank. &quot;When I came to Congress, they didn't tell us there wasanother way to get your check,&quot; she says. The way the HouseBank worked, members were allowed to draw on their futurechecks, which were then deposited into the bank. But for allher 15 years in Congress, Rep. Oakar says she never realizedthat she could deposit a U.S. House of Representativespaycheck in any bank she chose.   Rep. Oakar sits on the House Administration Committee,which oversaw the House Bank. Unfortunately for someone inthat kind of job, her math is weak, too. For months now shehas said she had only six overdrafts; an unofficial listplaces the number at 217.   The House members' explanations wouldn't likely float atyour bank around the corner. Imagine walking into your bankand explaining that your bounced check helped pay for agrotto in your back yard dedicated to the Virgin Mary. That'swhat California Republican Rep. Robert Dornan says is behindwhat he asserts is his only bad check, which he firstdisclosed last October.   Rep. Dornan says through a spokesman that he actually paidtwice for the stone setting. He says he sent a check that thecontractor said was lost in the mail. He says he then sent areplacement check, assuming that the workman would discardthe first one if it ever arrived. Rep. Dornan says hisaccount would have covered one check, but both checks werecashed. The amount of the overdraft was less than $1,000, thespokesman adds.   Democratic Rep. Lawrence Smith of Florida points at leastindirectly at his wife, Sheila, who he says kept her &quot;ownlittle checkbook&quot; as a separate money-dispenser from the maincheckbook that was under his control. &quot;Maybe hers and minemight have passed one another,&quot; Mr. Smith says, but then headds gallantly, &quot;I take full responsibility.&quot;   Others blame the bank itself. &quot;I feel that I wasvictimized,&quot; says Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Republicanof Wisconsin, about his 13 overdrafts totaling about $50,000.&quot;I was never notified of any problem with my account. Had Iever received any indication, that would have been the lasttime it would have happened.&quot;   Democratic Rep. Charles Hatcher of Georgia cites his heartattack and divorce as reasons for his 819 overdrafts. And GOPRep. Duncan Hunter of California asserts there was some&quot;moral balance&quot; to his overdrafting, which involved 407checks, because some of the money went to charity.   Rep. Tim Penny, Democrat of Minnesota, says it was thefault of his office manager, who had charge of his account.Even this &quot;meticulous, careful individual&quot; didn't know aboutthree overdrawn checks totaling $99, he says. But, in anycase, the congressman says, at least his bad checks were forgood causes: One was to a Christian youth group and anotherto a corngrowers association. &quot;It helps me explain that I'mnot an abuser,&quot; he says.   Denial is another favorite response. The biggest checkoffender, Arkansas Democrat-turned-Republican Tommy Robinson,a former House member, is alleged to have authored 996overdrafts, but won't admit to a single one. And DemocraticRep. Robert Mrazek of New York, who is currently running forthe Senate, is on the list for 972 overdrafts but says, &quot;Ihave never bounced a check&quot; -- since none was ever returned.   Rep. Hatcher of Georgia has a variation on that theme. Heis asserting that the 819 figure is too high -- it's probablyonly 400 or 500, he said over the weekend. (A spokesman saysthe congressman wasn't trying to minimize the number,however.)   Another Democrat, Edolphus Towns of New York, attributesat least some -- but probably not all -- of what is listed as403 overdrafts to an embezzlement by a former employee ofmore than $28,000. A spokesman says the employee had a drugproblem that led to &quot;a desperate need for capital,&quot; and wrotea series of checks on the congressman's account to satisfyit.   Georgia Rep. Newt Gingrich, the House Republican whip andthe most outspoken critic of the House Democraticleadership's handling of the bank mess, is himself having todo a little explaining. Last year he admitted having threebad checks. On Sunday he said he actually had about 20 ofthem. (He explained the discrepancy by saying he had examinedrecords for a longer period of time.) Now a spokesman saysthe number is between 20 and 30.   Hey, it isn't that big a deal, Rep. Gingrich says. &quot;Idon't think if you take a drink it's comparable to killingsomebody or driving under the influence,&quot; he told theAssociated Press.   For some lawmakers, the best excuse is no excuse.Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper of Tennessee says he stayed up allnight to examine his records so he couldn't be accused ofdoing the work on taxpayer's time. He found six overdrafts,and in addition to his profuse and repeated public apologies,he is paying the Treasury $75 for each of them. &quot;That's thehighest penalty I had heard of for a commercial bank,&quot; heexplains.   The House members who weren't touched by the scandal, ofcourse, look best by comparison with their taintedcolleagues. Manuel Lujan is a former representative from NewMexico who's now Interior Secretary. Asked if Mr. Lujan hadoverdrawn his account while in the House, a spokesman said no-- but then helpfully suggested directing the same questionat three other former House members in the Cabinet:Agriculture Secretary Edward Madigan, Labor Secretary LynnMartin and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.   Yesterday, all three confessed to overdrafts.</TEXT></DOC>
