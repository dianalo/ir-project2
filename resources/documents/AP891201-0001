However, Falin, a former Soviet ambassador to West Germany1971-78, said it was unlikely that any accords would issue from theMalta summit, even though the superpower session could speed thetimetable for U.S.-Soviet accords on reducing nuclear, conventionaland weaponry.   ``I think President Bush is right when he says there will be noconcrete agreement signed during the actual meeting,'' said Falin.   Bush has stressed that the summit will not focus on arms controland that he was ``not going to surprise'' the Soviets with anyflashy proposals. The president also has said he will not discussEastern Eurpopean boundaries with Gorbachev.   Gorbachev, however, is known for doing the unexpected, and hemay try to pressure Bush into talks on naval power by proposing aban on nuclear weapons in the Mediterranean.   U.S. officials have rejected Gorbachev's proposal to ban nuclearweapons from the Baltic Sea and other regions, and have balked atrepeated Soviet efforts to open talks on naval arms control.   Nevertheless, arms control is always on the summit table, andanalysts believe the Malta meeting may speed negotiations onnuclear, chemical and conventional arms.   ``It would seem like all the signs are pointing to quickresolution,'' said James Rubin, assistant director of the ArmsControl Association of Washington. ``But a summit resolution tomove to completion to all three is the best we should hope for.''   Gorbachev, in a joint statement Thursday with Italian leaders,expressed hope for agreements by the end of 1990 to cutconventional and chemical weapons _ and a third deal to sharplyreduce strategic arms stockpiles.   Bush and Gorbachev have said that the next summit, to be held inthe United States next spring or summer, might be used to sign aproposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). This would slashsuperpower nuclear arsenals by 30 to 50 percent, to 6,000 warheadsper side.   For the first time since Gorbachev sat down with then-PresidentReagan in Geneva in 1985, the arms control agenda is not dominatedby the U.S. space-based missile shield proposal, otherwise known asStar Wars, and that's a good omen for START.   The Soviets said in September they were removing a major STARTobstacle by dropping their precondition that the United Statesagree not to violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, whichrestricts strategic defenses.   Instead, the Soviets have reserved the right to rearm if theUnited States violates ABM by deploying Star Wars defenses.   The Soviets also agreed to include submarine-launched cruisemissiles in a separate agreement rather than in START. The UnitedStates has balked at curbing that class of weapons.   In September, the United States also removed a major obstacle toSTART, dropping its demand to ban mobile missiles. The Soviet Unionhas deployed two such systems, the 10-warhead SS-24 and thesingle-warhead SS-24.   Congress has approved funding for two comparable U.S. weapons,and the U.S. Air Force announced Wednesday that it was designatingsites to deploy 50 mobile versions of its 10-warhead MX missiles,which have been housed in silos up to this point.   On conventional arms, the Western and Eastern military allianceshave made steady progress in multilateral talks to sharply reduceforces in Europe, with only one major issue dividing them, thedefinition of an offensive aircraft.   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization wants the Warsaw Pact tocut 7,000 planes, versus a reduction of 1,000 for the West. But theKremlin says many of its planes, such as trainers, should not becounted, and that NATO has an advantage of up to 3,600 aircraft.   The two sides also have proposed different methods of countingtroops, with NATO seeking a limit of 275,000 deployed by eithersuperpower in Central Europe. The Warsaw Pact wants its proposedceiling of 300,000 to cover British and French troops in WestGermany. That would mean a reduction of about 30,000 U.S. troops inCentral Europe and 325,000 for the Soviets.   Eliminating chemical weapons stockpiles may prove morecomplicated, since 40 nations are involved in negotiations on aglobal ban. But a bilateral deal to cut U.S. and Soviet chemicalarms may be easier.</TEXT></DOC>
