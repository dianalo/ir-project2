That exceeds the 65% rank-and-file support for the 1984 contract, and matches Ford worker backing for the 1982 pact.    In the new three-year contract, Ford strengthened its previous job security provisions by promising to lay off workers only during a sales drop, and to limit attrition. In addition, workers get a 3% raise in the first year of the pact and lump-sum payments in the second and third years.    Some union members said they opposed the contract because it encourages changes in factory work rules.    The union will now try to get a similar contract at General Motors Corp. UAW President Owen Bieber is expected to join the talks today, and to meet tomorrow with GM officials.    GM has said it needs a different contract because it is less efficient than Ford and makes more parts in-house. Officials have said the attrition limit would make it harder to enhance productivity, and that GM needs separate pay or job security provisions for its parts workers.    Earlier this week, however, GM Chairman Roger B. Smith indicated that GM could use the Ford contract, at least as a &quot;framework&quot; for an agreement. </TEXT></DOC>
