Splitting of Tb/sup 3+/ ion ground state, conditionedby internal field of ferromagnetic phase was noted in absorption spectra,measured at Tandless;T/sub s/ = 2.87 K and the temperature dynamics of phasetransformation was followed. Experimental results were used to determinethe values of saturation magnetization of crystal M/sub o/ (1.1+-0.1)kOeand internal field parameter {lambda} = 5.8+-0.5. Manifestations of excitonstate existence in the crystal were noted: the difference in splittingvalues, measured according to transitions to different singlet states,and the presence of effective luminescence sensitization of defect centers.</TEXT></DOC>
