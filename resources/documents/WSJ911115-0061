Among other repercussions, a new approach at the300,000-member American Institute of Certified PublicAccountants could affect the institute's recently issuedethics rulings that completely ban accountant borrowings fromaudit clients.</LP><TEXT>   An institute task force on new ethics rules recentlydrafted a new conflict-of-interest proposal that would stategeneral ethics principles rather than specific prohibitions.A copy of the proposal was obtained by this newspaper.   The task force hasn't yet decided whether to continue theblanket ban on loans from audit clients, say some task forcemembers. That's because some accountants in rural areas withfew banks say it's difficult, if not impossible, to avoidborrowing from clients.   Some committee members say that permitting exceptions forsuch loans for any reason could hurt the reputation ofaccountants. &quot;Anything short of a complete prohibition wouldbe seen as loosening ethics and independence rules foraccountants,&quot; said John Heyman, a partner of accounting firmBDO Seidman and a member of the institute's task force. &quot;Thiscould bring a maximum disaster for accountants and beunacceptable to regulators,&quot; said Mr. Heyman.   The issue of loans by accountants from banks they audithas heated up since the Securities and Exchange Commissionfiled a lawsuit in June against Ernst andamp; Young. The SEC citedthe fact that the firm's audit partners years ago borrowedfrom Republicbank Corp., a former Texas banking company.   The SEC charged in its suit that the loans created aconflict of interest for the Ernst andamp; Young partners. Theaccounting firm gave the bank holding company's financialstatement a clean opinion. Shortly thereafter, Republicbankcollapsed in one of the country's biggest bank failures.   Ernst andamp; Young has filed court papers arguing that the SECaction is redundant since the firm's own internal rulesinstituted last February now prohibit the type of loans inquestion. And the accounting firm says that the SEC wasabusive in seeking to apply its rules on auditor independenceretroactively.   Thomas Kelley, an institute vice president overseeing theethics area, says that the new ethics proposal would have tobe discussed within the institute and possibly would need SECapproval before being adopted. He says that the proposal maybe issued for public comment in early 1992 and may entailpublic hearings.   The new proposal isn't an outgrowth of the SEC suitagainst Ernst andamp; Young, Mr. Kelley said. &quot;We first beganthinking about it in the spring of 1990,&quot; he added. Theinstitute seeks to convince the SEC to replace its rules andthose of the institute with more general combined rules. Theinstitute believes that relying on general statements ofprinciple rather than highly specific rules would make iteasier to merge the rules, members of the task force say.   Currently, SEC rules are more stringent than those of theinstitute. For example, the SEC bars an accountant fromkeeping an audit client's books, but institute rules permitthe practice if the client's management makes the finaldecisions on how to do the bookkeeping. Also, the SEC bars anaccountant from auditing the books of a company where arelative by blood or marriage -- even a brother-in-law'sbrother-in-law-works; however, institute rules bar such anaudit for accountants whose blood relatives or spouses workfor the client.</TEXT></DOC>
