The Occupational Safety and Health Administration recentlyproposed a so-called request for information on indoorpollution, including passive tobacco smoke. While thebureaucratic procedure is a long way from any final action,it is the first time OSHA has formally acted to considertobacco smoke as a workplace health hazard.</LP><TEXT>   The agency's cautious approach reflects concern aboutarousing powerful opposition from the tobacco industry, somemembers of Congress and even other Bush administrationofficials. One potential source of attack is the White House,where tobacco interests have considerable clout -- especiallyat the White House Council on Competitiveness, aregulator-watching group headed by Vice President Quayle --and at the Office of Management and Budget.   While many employers and localities have moved to ban orrestrict smoking in factories and offices, any OSHA action tofurther curb workplace smoking would have nationwide impact.&quot;If OSHA mandates {a ban or curbs}, that will speed up theprocess,&quot; says Samuel Johnson, president of the InternationalFacility Management Association, based in Houston.   The Labor Department agency is starting to move partlyunder prodding from the Environmental Protection Agency,which places tobacco smoke in the top tier of knowncarcinogens, asserting that it causes more deaths than manysubstances already regulated by OSHA. The EPA can't actdirectly because Congress barred it from regulating tobaccosmoke in 1976.   So the EPA is pushing OSHA, which has the authority toregulate work-site smoking but has been slow to act. The EPAis completing a revised study on passive tobacco smoke thatshows, for instance, that about 3,700 deaths annually are theresult of cancer caused by such smoke. The EPA plans tosuggest voluntary guidelines for how to handle tobacco smoke,as well as other indoor pollutants. EPA officials considersmoke the biggest indoor air quality problem, but not theonly one.   The EPA efforts are &quot;one reason we {are} moving ahead,&quot;says OSHA chief Gerard Scannell. Another is the courts. Inthe past five years, OSHA has received petitions from Actionon Smoking and Health, or ASH, an anti-smoking group here, toban or restrict smoking. OSHA has always flicked aside thepetitions, but a federal court in Washington has directed theagency to answer ASH allegations of &quot;unreasonable delay.&quot;OSHA responded that there hasn't been any undue delayconsidering the issue's complexity.   There is clearly mounting pressure on OSHA officials totake action, says Athena Mueller of ASH. &quot;I think verystrongly that they will have to act,&quot; she says.   Partly to minimize controversy, OSHA is tackling the issueas part of a broader look at indoor air pollution thatincludes other substances such as lead, formaldehyde, radongas, combustion gases and harmful building materials. Thatapproach is expected to draw less head-on opposition from thetobacco industry and others, including some labor unions,that oppose smoking curbs.   The AFL-CIO plans to endorse the broader approach. Thefederation must balance the health worries of many unionworkers against fierce resistance from other members whosmoke. And because of job concerns, the Bakery, Confectioneryand Tobacco Workers union has gotten the federation todeclare that the issue of smoking curbs should be resolved bycollective bargaining.   The tobacco industry would also prefer that OSHA considerissuing a broad-based rule that covers indoor air pollutantsand involves better ventilation rather than singling outtobacco smoke. &quot;What I'd like to do is a good job on indoorair quality,&quot; Mr. Scannell says, &quot;and if smoking is a part ofit, then so be it.&quot;   Mr. Scannell will be leaving OSHA on Friday to return toprivate business, but he doesn't expect his departure to slowany OSHA action on workplace smoking. &quot;It's on track -- Ithink it's going to be very difficult to take it off track,&quot;he says.   The process will be tortuous, however. Instead of issuingan advanced notice of proposed rule-making -- the usual firstregulatory step -- OSHA late last year proposed the requestfor information. This will probably be followed by regulatoryproposals.   The decision to take the cautious approach was made byLabor Secretary Lynn Martin on the recommendation of herpolicy office. But the caution angers antismoking advocates.&quot;OSHA chose the most lowly and miserable regulatory actionthey could think of,&quot; complains Ms. Mueller, ASH's generalcounsel. &quot;Their docket is already bursting with information&quot;on smoking. Mrs. Mueller also argues that including smokingas part of a general indoor-air-quality problem&quot;automatically dilutes the attention&quot; to smoking.   That appears to be part of OSHA's strategy. &quot;I was reallypleased that it sorted out this way,&quot; OSHA's Mr. Scannellsays. &quot;We did not come under attack&quot; from industry.   One reason is that &quot;we expect OSHA to be much moreobjective&quot; than the EPA is, says Thomas Lauria, a spokesmanfor the Tobacco Institute, a Washington-based group thatspearheads the industry's lobbying effort. Government datadon't justify smoking bans that would &quot;cut off the 30% of theworkers&quot; who smoke, he asserts. In arguing againstregulation, the group plans to cite, as it has in the past, areport by the government's National Institute on OccupationalSafety and Health. The Tobacco Institute argues that the 1984NIOSH report shows that tobacco smoke accounts for only 2% ofindoor air pollution.   But NIOSH has complained that tobacco companies havemisrepresented the 1984 report. And critics such as ASH quotea NIOSH report issued last year that calls for a ban onwork-site smoking because it is a serious health hazard.   The tobacco industry response won't be aimed only at OSHA.&quot;We're definitely making our views known anywhere in thegovernment. We've been an effective lobby over the decades,&quot;Mr. Lauria says.   In addition to administration officials, the tobacco lobbyalso counts on help from friends in Congress like Rep. ThomasBliley, a Virginia Republican. After the EPA issued a draftreport on passive smoke and cancer in June 1990, Mr. Blileysaid the work was faulty. An EPA science advisory board lastyear sent the report back to the EPA to better justify itsconclusions, though the board said those conclusions arebasically sound. The EPA is expected to issue its revisedreport this spring.   Now, Mr. Bliley's office warns that any OSHA smoking rulewill have to be defensible in court. Says JeffreySchlagenhauf, a Bliley aide: &quot;I hope OSHA understands theimportance of really doing the scientific work it's supposedto do and won't just take the EPA's studies at face value.&quot;   ---                    A Look at Lighting Up                                                                                                          -- An estimated 28% of Americans age 18 and over aresmokers.   -- About 400 city and county ordinances restrict smokingin the workplace, but only 10 ban it outright.   -- A total of 37 states have laws restricting smoking inthe workplace.   -- About 75% of 1,794 facility managers in a survey saythey ban or sesgregate smoking in their offices or factories.
