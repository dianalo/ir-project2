George W. Bush, the 43 year-old Texas oilman who heads thepartnership that purchased the Rangers earlier this year, and hiswife Laura joined his parents behind home plate in the skybox ofOrioles' owner Eli Jacobs.   Before the game, the president, baseball Commissioner A.Bartlett Giamatti and American League President Bobby Brown visitedthe Rangers' and then the Orioles' locker rooms.   The president and first lady left with the Orioles batting inthe bottom of the sixth inning and the Rangers ahead 6-2. TheOrioles ended up 6-4 losers.   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had said earlier it would be hard forthe president to decide for whom to root.   The Orioles, leading the American League East, have won duringprevious presidential visits this year. The president is a keenbaseball fan who captained the 1948 Yale team and keeps his oldfirst baseman's mitt in his desk.   He came on opening day with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak andagain on June 28 when he brought his 13-year-old grandson, GeorgeP. Bush.   His son's Rangers began the evening in fourth place in theAmerican League West with a record of 57-49, two more victoriesthan the Orioles have in their weaker division.   On a humid 91-degree night, Bush shed his jacket and tie towatch the game in a white short-sleeved shirt.   Barbara Bush, who arrived earlier in the day from the family'svacation home at Kennebunkport, Maine, wore a belted red tunic overa black skirt. Their son, also in shirt sleeves, wore a blueRangers cap.   All three waved to the crowd before the game. The president andhis wife drew cheers, but his son was hooted when he waved theRangers cap.   All drank large sodas; the president had peanuts and he and hiswife also had corn on the cob. The president took time out toautograph some baseballs and occasionally they used binoculars tofollow the action.   The Bushes also were accompanied by Woody Willoughby, an usherin the White House residence.</TEXT></DOC>
