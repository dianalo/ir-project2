HuntStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> RUSSELL, Kan.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   With this small prairie hometown symbolizing attachment to his roots, Sen. Robert Dole formally launched his presidential campaign, pledging to make a balanced budget the centerpiece of his presidency and drawing a pointed contrast to his chief rival, Vice President George Bush.    &quot;The federal budget deficit is the single greatest threat to a prosperous and dynamic America,&quot; the Kansas Republican declared. In the first weeks of a Dole presidency, he vowed, he would sit down with congressional leaders and hammer out a plan that &quot;ends with a balanced budget.&quot;    Unlike party opponents George Bush and Jack Kemp, tax increases would be part of any Dole deficit-reduction package, as he promised only not to raise existing tax rates. On the spending side, he exempted &quot;only programs to assist vulnerable&quot; Americans, and thus Social Security would be on the Dole deficit-reduction table. Over the longer run, he called for a balanced-budget constitutional amendment and a line-item veto for the president.    Stressing his &quot;track record&quot; over more than a quarter century in Congress, the 64-year-old Senate minority leader drew a sharp comparison with Vice President Bush: &quot;I offer a record, not a resume.&quot; In another veiled swipe at Mr. Bush, he praised President Reagan but said the Reagan record is &quot;not something to run on. It's something to build on.&quot;    With more than 5,000 local citizens huddling in the freezing cold on Main Street, waving American flags and singing &quot;God Bless America,&quot; the announcement was full of heartland symbolism. A local hero whose recovery from serious World War II wounds is a local legend, Sen. Dole was presented with the drugstore cigar box into which citizens donated money more than 40 years ago to help pay the cost of his recovery.    In typical senatorial fashion, Sen. Dole left few bases untouched, reeling off a laundry list of promises to better education, oppose abortion and improve health care. He also vowed to begin a &quot;phased deployment&quot; of the Strategic Defense Initiative, insist that U.S. allies pick up a larger burden of security costs and press the Soviets to pull back in their aggression everywhere from Afghanistan to Nicaragua. He didn't take a specific stand on the INF treaty that President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev are expected to sign Dec. 7, but said it must &quot;be accompanied by a restored balance of conventional forces in Europe.&quot;    By almost any measure, Sen. Dole and Vice President Bush are well ahead of the other GOP presidential aspirants. The latest Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll two weeks ago showed Mr. Bush the choice of 34% of likely Republican voters and Mr. Dole the choice of 23%, with the other candidates far behind. Many Democrats hope the Republicans will nominate Mr. Bush, whom they believe would be easy to defeat, and fear that Sen. Dole would be a much more formidable opponent if he won the nomination.    But Iowa, site of the first presidential caucuses, is crucial for Sen. Dole. Since he hails from a neighboring state and is more experienced in agricultural issues than any other aspirant, anything other than a first-place finish in Iowa would be a setback to the Dole hopes. His first stop after leaving here yesterday was Waukee, Iowa, where he appeared before an enthusiastic farm gathering with grain bins and hogs as a backdrop, sending, he said, a signal that &quot;in a Dole administration, agriculture will be a priority, not an afterthought.&quot; He ended up last night in New Hampshire, site of the first presidential primary. He is the last anticipated entry into the 1988 presidential contest.    One unrivaled asset that Mr. Dole brings to his campaign is his wife Elizabeth, the former transportation secretary. She's a politically shrewd, very effective campaigner, and as a native Southerner gives her husband cachet in that important region.    Sen. Dole brings some other pronounced strengths -- and some decided weaknesses -- to the race. More than any other candidate, he possesses an incredibly quick and sharp wit, and at the same time projects an aura of toughness and competence. Supporters hope this image will be enhanced in the next few weeks with the Kansas Republican playing a key role in engineering a budget accord.    Earlier, Mr. Dole privately said he would step down as Senate GOP leader as the campaign heated up, but he now indicates he'll stay in that post to keep capitalizing on his theme of effective leadership. But he could change his mind if faced with such controversial issues as the INF treaty and a Supreme Court nomination early next year just when it's essential to be omnipresent in the early presidential contests.    Moreover, Sen. Dole never has matched his exceptional skills as a legislator with commensurate talents as a national campaigner. As Gerald Ford's running-mate in 1976, he acquired a reputation as a hatchet man with such tactics as bitterly denouncing &quot;Democrat wars.&quot; And he was a dismal failure as a presidential candidate in 1980, finishing last in the New Hampshire primary with only 597 votes, less than 1% of the total.    Other complaints about Mr. Dole as a candidate include a reputation for running a chaotic organization and displaying a lack of vision. Any organizational problems may have been eased with the recent appointment as campaign chairman of former Labor Secretary William Brock, who was a party chairman and an immensely respected political operative.    Sen. Dole may have been somewhat less successful in addressing the vision problem yesterday when he said the &quot;fundamental theme&quot; of his campaign would be that &quot;America must stop living for today while ignoring the long-term implications of our decisions and actions.&quot; He also repeated his pledge to make the Republican Party more open and diverse. </TEXT></DOC>
