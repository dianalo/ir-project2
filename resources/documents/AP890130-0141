Based on conservative projections of growth in electricitydemand, the nation will need an additional 50,000 megawatts ofgenerating capacity by 1997 in order to avoid a shortage, a newlypublished American Gas Association study said.   That amount would be needed in addition to the 32,500 megawattsof capacity currently under construction, the study said.   Using an assumption of faster electricity demand growth over thenext decade, which the gas group said it considered to be morerealistic, an additional 105,000 megawatts of plant capacity wouldbe needed to avoid shortages.   The study said 71 percent of capacity additions planned in the1979-88 period were canceled.</TEXT></DOC>
