Stats. in Med. 5:539-546 (1986).)The author looked at two major studies for agreement or reinforcement.The two studies were the life span study of the survivors of the Hiroshimaand Nagasaki bombings and a study of a group of patients who had been treatedwith x-rays for ankylosing spondylitis. The author looked at the questionof the relative risk for leukemia and other kinds of malignant disease,finding substantial constancy of relative risk, with the exception of leukemiaand central nervous system tumors. She also noted substantial agreementin the risk per rad for leukemia in the two studies of approximately twocases per million per year per rad. Additionally, she noted a reinforcementbetween the two studies for the adult age groups in the relative risk forleukemia and solid cancers. The relative risk for solid cancers in bothstudies looked ostensibly constant as a function of progressing time. Theconclusion reached by the author was that statistically the relative riskmodel appeared to be the most consistent with the data. She further concluded,``the similarity of the findings in two high dose studies, where exposuretook place under very different conditions, increases confidence in generalizingfrom these studies to other irradiated populations and detailed modelingof the radiogenic risk indicates a simple relative risk model for a particulargroup of cancers.'' <T3>Commentary: </T3>The Veterans Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards(the Committee) believed that the paper presented strong evidence in supportof the relative risk model and that the absolute risk model was not compatiblewith the data. Relatively wide error bars were noted by the Committee,however, and these were not commented on in the paper. The Committee furtherobserved that this kind of study could only deal with all solid tumorsas a group. It believed that while the analysis was relevant in terms ofrisk analysis it did not assist in answering the issue of probability ofdeveloping a radiogenic cancer. An additional limitation of this analysis is that in both groups of irradiatedsubjects, the radiation was delivered at a high dose rate. It is also notedthat risk estimates can only be derived from high dose studies where theexposure increases cancer mortality rates by 40 percent or more. The studyis relevant to risk assessment at high doses and dose rates. It affordsno basis for modifying VA's guidelines concerning the adjudication of claimsbased upon exposure to ionizing radiation. (b) Editorial, ``Dermatologic Radiotherapy, the Risk-Benefit Ratio.'' (Arch.Dermatol. 122:1385-1388 (1986).) The editorial was occasioned by a paper on the results of a study of 14,140patients in Sweden who had received Grenz ray for superficial skin cancer.That study indicated that these ultrasoft x-rays could cause a very smallnumber of cancers in those who received high doses. The editorial commentedthat the risk of Grenz ray therapy was small and noted the non-stochasticand other effects of radiation therapy. <T3>Commentary: </T3>The Committee believed the commentary to be of marginalrelevance to the veterans' situation particularly since the veterans' exposurewas to radiation of a different quality than that used in the study commentedon by the editorial. The doses of the soft x-rays were very high and theresults are not applicable for situations other than induction of skincancer as a consequence of superficial radiotherapy. (c) Editorial, ``Human Effects Following Exposure to Ionizing Radiation.''(Arch. Dermatol. 122:1380-1382 (1986).) The paper discussed a few reports concerning injuries associated with theaccident at Chernobyl. The editorial noted the increase in malignanciesin the Hiroshima-Nagasaki population and the threat of radiation exposureto overall human health. <T3>Commentary: </T3>The Committee considered this paper to be factuallyerroneous, uninformed and not of any significance. It is more a philosophicalreflection of the relation of radiation to culture than a scientific statement.It bears no relevance to the veterans' experience. The Department concurswith this assessment. (d) Evans, et al., ``The Influence of Diagnostic Radiography on the Incidenceof Breast Cancer and Leukemia.'' (N. Eng. J. Med. 315:810-815 (1986).)This study sought to estimate the numbers of excess cases of leukemia andbreast cancer attributable to diagnostic radiotherapy. The authors concludedthat there was a small effect of radiation-induced carcinogenisis in relationto tumors of the bone marrow and breast. Induced cases of leukemia wereestimated to be 1 percent of all cases of leukemia and somewhat less than1 percent for induced cases of breast cancer. <T3>Commentary: </T3>The Committee believed that some of the age-specificcoefficients used to predict radiation-induced breast cancer were outdatedand agreed with the criticism expressed in an accompanying series of Lettersto the Editor. The study was based upon information on a closed populationof 75,000 people in Maine to estimate exposure due to diagnostic x-rayprocedures as a function of age. These data were then used to calculatedose to bone marrow and breast. Then using usual risk calculations andthe calculated doses, the study reached the conclusion that 1 percent ofthe leukemias and less than 1 percent of breast cancer occurring in theUnited States might be associated with diagnostic radiography. The associatedcommentary analyzed the data and properly pointed out that the over-40group for whom mammography is recommended are at little or no risk forbreast cancer. The paper is relevant to veterans in the sense that theymay have greater than average diagnosic x-ray exposure due to injuriesreceived during their period of service and perhaps because of more extensivemedical care received through the VA health care system than may be availableto the general population. No basis for changing VA's guidelines was presentedin this paper. (e) Goffman, ``The Plutonium Controversy.'' (JAMA 236:284-286 (1976).)This paper focused on lung cancer. The author contended that plutonium'scarcinogenicity had been seriously underestimated and that reliance upona plutonium based energy economy would result in an excess of 130,000 additionalfatalities per year in the United States. <T3>Commentary: </T3>The Committee questioned the paper's conclusions andnoted that the author in every choice he made took the higher figure witha resultant multiplicative effect. The Committee believed that the papermay be somewhat relevant to the veterans' experience but that the conclusionsexpressed were not supported by the data. The Department concurs with thisassessment. (f) Ichimaru, et al., ``Multiple Myeloma Among Atomic Bomb Survivors inHiroshima and Nagasaki, 1950-1976; Relationship to Radiation Dose Absorbedby Marrow.'' (JNCI 69:323-328 (1982).) This paper deals with the estimated risk for multiple myeloma associatedwith the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings. The data suggest no increased incidenceof multiple myeloma in the 20 to 59 age group at the time of the bombingwho received less than 50 rads. Also, the excess did not appear until morethan 20 years following the exposure. The authors concluded that theiranalysis showed that the standardized relative risk adjusted for city,sex, and age at the time of the bombings increased with absorbed radiationdose to the bone marrow. The increased relative risk, the authors noted,did not appear to differ between cities or sexes and was demonstrable onlyfor those survivors whose age at the time of the bombings was between 20and 59 years. The estimated risk for those individuals was appproximately0.48 cases per million person years per rad for bone marrow total dose.<T3>Commentary: </T3>The Committee noted that the earlier literature generallydid not conclusively relate the induction of multiple myeloma to radiationexposure but that more recent data from Japan does not show an apparentexcess of multiple myeloma among the heavily irradiated survivors. TheDepartment believes that the number of cases is so small that it is difficultto reach statistically significant conclusions. Among the over 50 rad group,there were a total of 5 cases. The Committee expressed concern that theDepartment's current guideline of a 5-year minimum latency period may beunreasonably short, a more reasonable minimum latency being 15 years. TheCommittee expressed criticism that the authors failed to look more closelyat the below 50 rad exposure group. The Department is of the opinion thatthe paper would suggest that the exposure of veterans during the atomicweapons tests was too low to produce a measurable increase of multiplemyeloma. A reassessment would be appropriate following a reevaluation ofdata accumulated between 1976 and 1982. (g) Johnson, ``Cancer Incidence in an Area of Radioactive Fallout DownwindFrom the Nevada Test Site.'' (JAMA 251:230-236 (1984).) This study looked at Mormon populations in southwestern Utah exposed toradioactive fallout from atmospheric testing or from venting of undergroundnuclear detonations. The control population was the Mormon population forall of Utah. In looking at cancer incidence the author found 109 more casesof cancer than expected, with leukemia being the most prominent early (1958through 1966). The excess of leukemia persisted into the later period examined,1972 through 1980. Also observed were excess cases of lymphoma, thyroidcancer, breast cancer, gastrointestinal tract cancers, melanoma, bone cancer,and brain tumors. <T3>Commentary: </T3>The Committee criticized the author for not havingcomplete references to the sources upon which a number of statements inthe paper were based. The Committee also believed that there were no organizeddata in the paper regarding the integrated exposure in residential communitiesin southwest Utah which might relate to personal doses actually received.Another criticism of the Committee was the failure to verify the casesby checking with the Utah Cancer Registry or with physicians, hospitalsor the State Registrar of Vital Statistics. This failure may have resultedin an exaggeration of the excess solid cancers. Other criticisms includedthat the opportunity for media bias resulting in overreporting or exaggerationof reports of disease was very high and yet was not discussed in the paper.An additional criticism was the nonrandom selection for the individualsselected for interview and the town selected for examination. The Committeeoffered the opinion that the study was seriously flawed by methodologicalproblems. The Department concurs with the Committee's assessment and furthernotes that while there was a claim that there was a subgroup with a historyof acute radiation effects from fallout, no medical records of acute radiationfallout effects were reported on although this was a population with readyaccess to good medical care. Furthermore, the Department notes that theclaim is made that in the period from 1967 to 1975, there was a 60 percentincrease in cancer in the fallout group compared to the control group.The Department notes in this regard that there was only a 6 to 8 percentincrease in malignancies through 1982 in the survivors of the Hiroshima-Nagasakibombing. The Department concludes that the paper is not scientificallydesigned and  cannot withstand strict scientific scrutiny. (h) Linos, et al., ``Low-dose Radiation and Leukemia.'' (N. Eng. J. Med.302:1101-1105 (1980) and Letter to the Editor. This paper presented a case control study on 138 patients with leukemiasand the exposures that they had received from diagnostic x-rays with matchedcontrols. The authors concluded that there was no statistically significantincrease in the risk of developing leukemia after radiation doses of 0to 300 rads (3 gy) to the bone marrow when the amounts were administeredin small doses over long periods of time. <T3>Commentary: </T3>A series of letters followed this study. The principalcriticism expressed was that analyses were based on a small number of casesand that the authors had mixed together types of leukemia known to be inducedby exposure to ionizing radiation with those that are not. The Committeeagreed with the criticism that the study was of too low statistical powerfor the study's negative findings to be conclusive. The Department believesthat the study is relevant to the veteran population in that it demonstratesthat fractionated exposure even at high doses does not result in a detectableincrease in leukemia_the malignancy most easily detectable after radiationexposure.(i) Machado, et al., ``Cancer Mortality and Radioactive Fallout in SouthwesternUtah.,'' (Am. J. Epidemiol. 125:44-61 (1987).)The study looked at three counties in southwestern Utah, an area wherefallout levels were recorded to be higher, on the average, than elsewhere.The authors found no evident site-specific excess of any forms of cancerexcept leukemia. Mortality from all cancer sites combined was significantlylower in southwestern Utah than in the remainder of the State. Also, therewere no significant changes between the pre- and post-fallout periods incomparisons of mortality in southwestern Utah with the rest of the Stateor with the United States. The study did find a significant excess of childhoodleukemia. The authors did not see this excess as conclusive but ratheras hypothesis generating. <T3>Commentary:</T3> The Committee believed this to be a well-designedand well-conducted study. It did believe, however, that more work shouldhave been done to determine whether the leukemia and mortality incidencewas real. The Department concurs with this assessment. The paper notesthat there were only 12 childhood deaths from leukemia in southwest Utahduring 1950 to 1980 and so there is the problem of small number statistics.Bader (N. Eng. J. Med. 300:1491-  (1979)) pointed out that in King County(Seattle), Washington, that although there were 217 childhood leukemiadeaths from 1950 to 1952, in 1959 there were only 2 deaths and in 1963there were 20. For successive 3 year periods the leukemia deaths were 25,19, and 41. Thus, even with larger numbers, successive periods show a twofolddifference in rates. It would appear that the increase in odds for leukemiaand the decrease in odds for solid tumors may simply represent statisticalvariation.(j) Nussbaum, ``Survivor Studies and Radiation Standards.'' (Bull. of theAtomic Scientists 41:62-  (1985).)The principal thesis of this article was that cancer risks from low levelradiation exposure are significantly higher than would be expected on thebasis of internationally accepted standards for radiation protection. Theauthor questioned the reliance upon the atomic bomb survivor data notingthat the data collection did not begin until 1950. He noted that duringthe interval between 1945 and 1950, the survivors had experienced harshweather conditions and inadequate food and medical supplies and poor sanitationservices. He suggested, therefore, that those surviving until 1950 experiencedthe equivalent of the healthy worker or ``survivor'' effect with the resultthat the death rate among these individuals should have been significantlylower than the national average for Japan. Since it was not, the authorquestioned the conclusion that the only correlation with exposure was increasedmortality due to cancer. The author also criticized other studies and putforward several studies which are contended to be supportive of the author'sthesis that radiation is far more dangerous than officially acknowledged.<T3>Commentary:</T3> The Committee noted that the author failed to notethe existence of a number of studies and reviews which refute or questionthe papers that the author relied upon. Consequently, the Committee didnot believe that the paper was credible and that it had little relevanceto the veteran population of interest. The Department agrees with thisassessment. (k) Zufan, et al., ''Epidemiological Investigation of Mutational Diseasein the High Background Radiation Area of Jangjiang, China.'' (J. Radiat.Res. 27:141-150 (1986).) This paper concerns an Epidemiological investigation of whether or notthere is a higher rate of mutation-based disease (cancer, hereditary disease,and congenital defects) in inhabitants exposed to high levels of backgroundradiation versus those that were exposed to normal levels of backgroundradiation in a control area. The annual individual external exposure toenvironmental gamma radiation was 330 millirad per year in the high backgroundradiation area and 114 millirad per year in the control area. The interimconclusions reported by the authors were: (1) no statistically significantdifferences were noted for total nor site specific cancer mortality ratesbetween the two areas; (2) the rates for hereditary disease and congenitaldefects were almost identical in the two areas; and (3) a higher frequencyof Down's Syndrome was noted in the high background area which may be dueto the age of the mothers at the time of birth as well as the age distributionof the children examined. The authors noted that further study was neededbefore conclusions could be arrived at. <T3>Commentary:</T3> The Committee had difficulty assessing this paperbecause of the incomplete presentation of data. The Department agrees withthis assessment and notes that while the study was well formulated, 1tdoes need to be extended to gain credibility and/or ability. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary Comments and Conclusions </ITAG>This group of 11 papers again indicates how difficult it is to produceincontestable epidemiological evidence. In spite of many projects beingwell covered and much effort being applied to their planning, implementationand interpretation, few ultimately withstand expert scrutiny and fewershift the balance of existing precepts. Our solid knowledge is hard earned.For the most part, the questions that were elusive in the first pass ofresearch remain difficult and yield to answers reluctantly. Nevertheless, some advances have been suggested, if not established, suchas the probably radiogenic qualities of multiple myeloma, the resilienceof the body exposed to low doses of ionizing radiation, and some of thepossible responses of the skin to radiation exposure. Several items demonstrated the difficulty of dealing with stochastic effectswhich we know occur but which we cannot so easily identify in the pool.The uncertainty creates problems of judgment and, as some of the papersshow, opens the issues at hand to a wide range of political and emotionalinterpretations that further compound the quest for oblectivity. <ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-15252 Filed 6-27-89; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 8320-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
