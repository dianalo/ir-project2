In his first trip back to his adopted home state since theinauguration, Bush said he was grappling with ``ticking time bombsthat we need to defuse without delay. And we're doing just that.''   He mentioned the savings and loan industry, burgeoning debt inthe Third World and drug abuse in the United States.   Bush said in a luncheon speech that his administration wasworking on ``an American agenda for the long term.''   In the speech and a question-and-answer session that followed,Bush also:   _Called on Congress to move more quickly on his plan to shore uptroubled savings and loans, saying ``there's no excuse for delay.''   _Declared himself ``very pleased'' that the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee had voted approval of his new defense secretary nominee,Rep. Dick Cheney, but also complained anew that his rejected firstchoice, former Texas Sen. John Tower, was ``tried by perception andrumor. That is not the American way.''   But in Washington, Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., released anunclassified FBI report which said a background investigation ofTower had turned up ``a prior pattern of alcohol abuse.'' It wasreports about Tower's drinking and relations with women, along withhis acceptance of consulting fees from defense contractors, that ledto his defeat.   _Firmly restated his opposition to Democratic-backed efforts toraise the minimum wage to $4.65 an hour, saying his own plan for amaximum $4.25 wage with a lower ``training wage'' was ``my first andlast offer.''   _Said in regard to the emotional issue of restrictions onsemiautomatic weapons, ``I do want to find a solution to theso-called AK-47 assault weapon problem _ one that protects therights of the legitimate sportsman but also protects the lives ofour police officers who are laying their lives on the line.''   Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president supports theaction Wednesday of Colt Industries to suspend sales to the publicof its AR-47 semiautomatic rifle, the civilian version of themilitary M-16.   ``He thinks it's a reasonable move on their part,'' Fitzwatersaid.   On Tuesday, the administration announced it would suspend theimport of most foreign-made semiautomatic rifles.   In addition to saying he was pursuing his agenda at his ownspeed, Bush said Thursday he was not going to be forced into movingmore quickly in dealings with the Soviet Union.   He said recent changes in the Soviet Union ``are profound.''   ``But we're facing a challenge. We've got to figure it out. We'vegot to measure Soviet intentions and then move,'' he said.   On another foreign policy issue, Fitzwater said Bush had decidedin principal to go ahead with a proposed joint venture with theJapanese for the production in Japan of a new version of the F-16fighter.   However, the spokesman said that Bush must still decide onsafeguards to prevent the loss of sensitive technology and that afinal decision may not come until next week.   Bush told his audience at the Forum Club in Houston, ``I've comehome to Texas to tell you we're hard at work in Washington _ andwe're making progress.''   Later, he was traveling to Colorado Springs, Colo., to addressthe Junior Achievement National Business Leadership Conference.   When he arrived at 6,800-foot high Colorado Springs, Bushimmediately went to a local high school and did seven laps _ walkingand jogging _ around a quarter-mile track.   As he passed a group of reporters, the president threw up hisarms and said, ``no air.''

End Embargoed Material      Before leaving on his two-day western trip, Bush talked to theDiscovery shuttle astronauts _ ``today's pioneers'' _ from the OvalOffice, inviting them to the White House upon their return andpromising ``a strong, active space program'' despite budgetconstraints.   Eight weeks into his administration, Bush has been the target ofcriticism in the Democratic-led Congress that he has failed to movequickly enough on an agenda.   Bush said Thursday, ``In this kind of work, more is going on thanmeets the eye _ or makes the headlines.''   ``The proof will come when we look back from the year 2000. AndI'm confident that we will be able to look back with pride on workwe did to get ready for a new century _ provided we look forwardtoday.''   In Washington, Vice President Dan Quayle also defended the newadministration's pace, saying, ``We're succeeding an administrationof our own party at a time when the country is in good shape ... sowe're certainly not going to be stampeded into doing things for thesake of doing them soon, or quickly, or to show `momentum' or somesuch thing.''   ``Quick fixes are often bad fixes,'' Quayle added, in a speech tothe National Press Club.   Bush rattled off a variety of positions his administration hasadvanced _ ranging from a new child-care tax break he offered onWednesday to month-old legislation to rescue the nation's troubledsavings and loan industry, a prime issue in Texas, home to many ofthe nation's insolvent Sandamp;Ls.   He said Sandamp;L officials ``guilty of criminal actions'' must be``pursued and punished.''   Bush said the Sandamp;L crisis was among the ``time bombs'' that needto be defused, and he pressed Congress to move more quickly to passhis plan ``with its central provisions intact.''   Sen. Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate BankingCommittee, said Thursday his committee plans to act on an Sandamp;L billby April 14 and is pressing for a full Senate vote by April 21.   ``We're going as fast as we can within the bounds of doing thejob properly,'' Riegle said.   Some congressional debate focuses on the cost of Bush's plan. TheWhite House contends it would cost taxpayers $40 billion; aCongressional Budget Office report puts the price closer to $100billion.   Insolvent Sandamp;Ls still in operation are incurring losses of $300million a month, Bush said, or ``almost $1 million dollars duringthe course of this luncheon.''</TEXT></DOC>
