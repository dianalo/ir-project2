But his hesitancy didn't stem from any moral dilemma. Mr. Garland was simply afraid that he wouldn't get paid.    The attorney told reporters outside the courtroom that he wouldn't commit himself to continue representing the extradited Colombian because, in cases where payment involves money tainted by drug trafficking, the government can seize a lawyer's fee. &quot;I'm not ready to take on any more pro bono work,&quot; Mr. Garland said.    As the Bush administration vows to step up drug prosecutions and as the Colombian government contemplates extraditing more suspected drug kingpins, the pool of experienced defense lawyers willing to defend narcotics traffickers is shrinking.    This attrition in the &quot;white powder&quot; bar, as it is known, stems largely from two decisions handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court in June. In those 5-4 decisions, the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize the assets of accused criminals, including funds used to pay lawyers' fees. They confirmed prosecutors' power to seize assets as a weapon in the war on drugs.    Writing for the majority, Justice Byron White said that criminally tainted assets belong to the government, not the accused, even if such funds &quot;are the only way that that defendant will be able to retain the attorney of his choice.&quot;    The fees involved can be huge. Joel Hirschhorn, a flamboyant Miami lawyer who for two decades has defended dozens of drug traffickers, says, &quot;No lawyer would take a big case for anything less than $250,000.&quot; Other attorneys say the increasing scarcity of white powder lawyers is driving fees up.    Mr. Garland, who thus far is continuing to represent Mr. Martinez, has already felt the sting of fee forfeiture; he is involved in a pending dispute with federal prosecutors over fees paid to him in another drug case. In that case, the government is trying to seize part of the value of a house, property that Mr. Garland says was turned over to him as payment from a client. He says the government's power to seize legal fees &quot;retards the willingness of good lawyers to take drug cases.&quot;    It's done far more than that. Some of the best-known names in the white powder bar have left the business altogether. Mr. Hirschhorn recently joined a big Miami law firm, Broad andamp; Cassell, where he'll handle only civil litigation.    &quot;This is my last drug trial,&quot; Mr. Hirschhorn proclaims during a break in court proceedings in Bridgeport, Conn., where he is defending an accused cocaine trafficker. &quot;I've lost three fees&quot; totaling &quot;in the low six figures,&quot; Mr. Hirschhorn laments. &quot;And I could see that the handwriting was on the wall.&quot;    Mr. Hirschhorn says he'll be happier -- and safer -- handling real-estate disputes. He adds that at least six other noted criminal lawyers in Miami, where many high-profile drug lawyers are based, have contacted him about making similar career switches.    Robert Breier, a Miami lawyer who once specialized in the tax aspects of drug cases, says he now takes mostly civil tax cases and turns away any prospective clients where charges involve drug trafficking. As Donald Bierman, a Miami lawyer who still represents drug defendants, puts it: &quot;Lots of people are applying for local judgeships.&quot;    Miami's Neal Sonnett, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, a national group with some 20,000 members, argues that the dearth of defense lawyers willing to handle drug cases raises constitutional problems, impairs the ability of accused traffickers to get a fair trial and warps the attorney-client relationship. He says defense lawyers now routinely require elaborate documentation from clients to prove that the source of their legal fees is untainted by drug profits. They also question clients exhaustively before accepting cases to ensure that they can provide such documentation. And defense lawyers negotiate with prosecutors to prevent fee-forfeiture proceedings before signing on to represent drug suspects.    &quot;It's constantly on my mind when I talk to a new client,&quot; says Mr. Sonnett, who still accepts drug cases despite the fact that in a recent California case he had to battle for 18 months to hold on to his fee. &quot;I'm willing to be a guinea pig in this war.&quot;    According to Mr. Sonnett, prosecutors are far more likely to go after the fees of lawyers who fight the government's charges, rather than those whose clients plead guilty and then cooperate with prosecutors. Thus, he argues, fee forfeiture produces an inherent attorney-client conflict that can undercut a lawyer's zealous advocacy for his client.    Actually, the chill in the white powder bar was being felt before the Supreme Court ruled. Concern about the seizing of attorney fees grew after Congress passed the 1984 Comprehensive Crime Control Act. The law expanded the government's power to go after assets of people convicted in narcotics cases by making all proceeds of the criminal enterprise, not just property used to carry out crimes, subject to forfeiture.    The Justice Department emphasizes that the government's fee-forfeiture power is used sparingly. Prosecutors in the field must demonstrate to superiors in Washington that they have &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; to believe that a defense attorney had &quot;actual knowledge&quot; that his payment came from assets tainted by drug profits before any proceedings begin. There have been fewer than 50 such cases, and no upsurge following the Supreme Court ruling, according to several department sources.    Some members of the white powder bar think that their colleagues who are fleeing the field are overreacting. &quot;I got into this business to make money and defend clients, and that's what I'm continuing to do,&quot; says Miami lawyer Irwin Lichter. &quot;I'm just being a lot more cautious.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
