<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-31-0559 </DOCNO><TEXT>A technique was previously reported which uses surface skimming SH wavespropagating on a web of welded railroad rails subjected to compressiveand tensile loads in a testing machine to make a quantitative measurementof the sign and magnitude of the stress. This paper describes an extensionof that technique toward the development of an instrument and probe tobe used to monitor thermal stresses in railroad tracks after installationin the field. Design and performance specifications for the EMAT systemare given along with the theoretical and experimental background forthe technique.</TEXT></DOC>
