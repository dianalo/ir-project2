Senior government and industry officials fromthe U.S. and many of the Asia-Pacific countries are to be brought togetherto strengthen their relationship through cooperation and dialogue overthe issues associated with the expansion of thermal coal trade and regionalenergy interdependence. Options and opportunities for both thermal coaland clean coal technology trade for U.S. industry will be identified. TheEast-West Center's Coal Trade model will enable its users to quickly andeasily project the potential reaction of the international market to shiftsin the supply or demand for thermal coal and/or from changes in the capacityof the logistical system to handle the anticipated coal export level.This noncompetitive financial assistance award is necessary to enhancethe public benefits by increasing the cooperative information exchangeamong key DOE and industry officials from the U.S. and their counterpartsin Asia-Pacific countries. There is no known other entity which is conductingor is planning to conduct a study of such magnitude and detail on thermalcoal trade and clean coal technology requirements in the Asia-Pacific region.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>for further information contact:</T2><ITAG tagnum="15">Bettyanne Moore, U.S. Department of Energy, San Francisco OperationsOffice, 1333 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94612.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Oakland, California, February 2, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">David J.
