Covered financial institutions are required to prepare their individualHMDA reports by March 31 of each year for their mortgage lending for theprevious calendar year. Such reports are filed with the appropriate Federalfinancial institution regulatory agency and are used by the FFIEC to preparereports showing aggregate mortgage lending in each Metropolitan StatisticalArea (MSA) in the United States. Under the HMDA, the FFIEC is requiredto make these aggregate reports on home mortgage lending for a particularyear available to the public by December 31 of the following year. Suchreports are used by individuals, community organizations, and governmentagencies to evaluate the performance of financial institutions in makingmortgage credit available in the communities in which they have offices.The reports, for example, can be used to compare lending among differentneighborhoods within a particular metropolitan area and to compare thelending patterns of individual financial institutions with the total forall institutions. The data in the reports also show aggregate lending patternsfor various categories of census tracts grouped according to income categories,racial characteristics, geographic location, and age of housing stock.The FFIEC makes these aggregate lending reports, as well as the reportsfor each financial institution, available to the public through a nationwidesystem of data depositories that the FFIEC has established. Reports of their mortgage lending by individual financial institutions_commercialbanks, savings institutions, credit unions, and certain mortgage bankingcompanies_provide the raw data that are used by the FFIEC to produce theHMDA aggregation reports. Consequently, the timeliness and accuracy ofthe reports produced by the FFIEC depend greatly on the timeliness andquality of the individual HMDA reports submitted by the financial institutions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Statement on the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act </ITAG>The text of the Statement follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's (FFIEC) memberagencies are the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptrollerof the Currency. The FFIEC is issuing this statement to encourage institutionscovered by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA or the Act) to adhereto the specific requirements of the Act and Regulation C (12 CFR Part 203).The agencies are concerned about the number of reporting errors in theHMDA report and the large number of reports received from financial institutionsafter the March 31 due date. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The FFIEC is required by the Act to make HMDA aggregation tables forthe previous year available to the public no later than December 31 ofeach year. Although the FFIEC has met this goal, there is strong Congressionaland public interest in making the aggregation tables available earlierin the year. In the conference report that accompanies the February 1988amendments to HMDA, the Congress called upon the FFIEC and the agenciesto take measures to expedite the availability of the HMDA data. Issuanceof this Statement is one of those measures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Covered institutions are encouraged to develop policies and proceduresthat will ensure full compliance with the HMDA and Regulation C. It isthe agencies' policy to provide institutions with guidance to assist themin providing timely and accurate reports. HMDA compliance will be emphasizedin examinations. The agencies will also consider what supervisory and enforcementactions may be appropriate to ensure compliance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The FFIEC and the agencies have already taken steps to assist coveredinstitutions in improving their performance:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The FFIEC has issued a manual, entitled ``A Guide to HMDAReporting_Getting it Right'', which provides an executive overview formanagement and an instructional section for persons preparing the HMDAreport forms. The guide is being made available by the agencies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The FFIEC has developed a reformatted census tract list thatidentifies the specific census tract numbers for each metropolitan statisticalarea with codes to indicate small and untraded counties that must be reportedby county name. In addition, the list identifies counties with dual censustracts that must be reported by both county name and census tract number.These lists will help prevent reporting errors and are available upon requestfrom each agency.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; A videotape entitled ``How to Prepare a HMDA Statement''is being prepared to assist in familiarizing compliance personnel withthe requirements of HMDA and Regulation C. This instructive video willbe made available upon request from the agencies at a nominal cost. Itwill assist institutions in preparing calendar year 1989 statements thatare due March 31, 1990.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Timely and accurate HMDA reporting is not only required by law, itis essential if the aggregate HMDA data is to be made available to thepublic at the earliest possible date. A cooperative effort among the agenciesand the covered institutions is imperative.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Suggestions on how to help ensure accurate and timely submission ofthe HMDA disclosure form are invited and encouraged.
