Waiting lists are long for the Miata, customers willingly paythousands of dollars over the $13,800 base price and there arereports that some owners have resold the cars at more than doublethe price they paid.   It's an obsession reminiscent of the Ford Mustang craze a quartercentury ago, and how long it will last is uncertain.   But the enormous success of the Miata, a throwback to the sportyclassic European roadsters of years past, seems to attest to theshrewd marketing and design talent employed by Japanese automakers _who in the past have successfully exploited other niches _ even inDetroit's own backyard. The car's creators were Americans.   ``It's one of the most exciting things I've witnessed,'' saidGeorge McCabe, deputy general manager of Mazda Motor of AmericaInc., the U.S. marketing arm of Mazda Motor Corp., based inHiroshima, Japan.   McCabe said the company doesn't have a count on dealer orders forthe 20,000 Miatas to be imported this year, and it's too early todecide whether production should be boosted beyond the 40,000planned for 1990.   When compared with overall auto sales in the United States, ofcourse, 40,000 is small. General Motors Corp., for example, soldmore than 140,000 cars in early August alone.   Still, GM and its chief U.S. rivals Ford Motor Co. and ChryslerCorp. have been forced to offer discounts and rebates on cars in anattempt to clear bloated inventories this summer, and even thathasn't been too successful. So the Miata's popularity is at least asymbolic slap in their faces.   The tiny car has virtually no trunk space and room behind the twoseats is minimal. Designers weren't thinking of long-distance roadtrips when they were putting the car together.   Their mission was to develop a basic sports car that would be funto drive at a price that undercut sporty cars with more power andelectronic gadgets.   ``The whole idea from the beginning was to make it an affordablesports car. There was just a big gap for an affordable elementalsports car,'' said Norm Garrett, a layout engineer for the Miataproject who now works for Volvo-GM Heavy Truck Corp. in Greensboro,N.C.   Officially, Miatas went on sale July 1, available in red, whiteand blue. Dealers have been taking orders from consumers basingtheir decisions on automotive magazine writers who gushed over thecar as far back as March.   All the publicity, excitement and limited availability havecreated a temptation for dealers, some of whom are said to begetting up to $5,000 over list price from Miata-hungry buyers.   McCabe said Mazda has sought to quell the temptation to gouge,though the company cannot dictate to dealers how much to charge.   ``We've taken as strong a position as we can with our dealers.We've notified them in writing about why it's bad for them, why it'sbad for Mazda and why it's shortsighted for them once this mediaattention dies down,'' McCabe said.   ``Consumers have a long memory,'' he said. ``If they feel they'rebeing taken advantage of, in the future I think they will rememberthat dealer took advantage of that situation and go to anotherdealer.''   John Zabawa, owner of Eastland Imports in Detroit, said consumersare lining up to buy Miatas. Zabawa said he's not gouging, eventhough demand exceeds supply.   ``There probably have been some people who have offered us more,but we take them in order,'' he said.   One of his customers, Kristen Smith of Detroit, got hers on July24 and paid $18,800, including the optional hard top. She said shebought the Miata because of its distinctive looks.   However, she added, ``The attention you get with it is not alwaysgood. I had someone follow me home, follow me for a long time, foran hour.''   Scott Petterson of Northville, Mich., a parking lot attendant ata swank restaurant in Detroit, said he's driven four or five Miatas.   ``We get Ferraris, everything out here and this is the only onethat everybody stares at,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday Aug. 20</NOTE></DOC>
