In a dramatic climax to the coup in Moscow, thehard-liners who took power Monday were forced to capitulateyesterday by defiant protesters and a determined RussianParliament that held firm against tanks and threats. BorisYeltsin, the president of the Russian republic, led thatresistance from the embattled parliament building in Moscowand seemed to tower over the hard-liners during the tensestandoff. He now emerges as easily the most powerful man inthe nation.</LP><TEXT>   By rallying the general public and parts of the armyagainst the eight leaders of the coup, Mr. Yeltsin showedthat democratic changes ushered in by President MikhailGorbachev over the past six years have had an enormous -- andperhaps irreversible -- effect on the U.S.S.R. The defeat ofthe hard-liners is widely expected to speed efforts totransform the Soviet Union into a stronger democracy based ona new federal system of decentralized power and marketeconomics. It also provides a unique opportunity for thenation's legitimate leaders to purge the remains of the oldtotalitarian system.   &quot;The failure of the coup marks the Soviet Union'stransformation into a kind of modern European society,&quot; saysFrancis Fukuyama, a former State Department official who haswritten about the meaning of the collapse of communism. &quot;Itproves that Gorbachev's revolution hasn't been just arevolution of elites, that there's been this spontaneousdevelopment of a political consensus among Russians.&quot;   But while jubilation filled the streets and squares ofcities throughout the country, and while columns of armoredvehicles retreated from Moscow's center, many people werecautioning that difficult times lie ahead: The hard-linersmay have been ejected, they say, but the vast problems ofreviving the moribund Soviet economy and streamlining itscentral government remain. Both could take years toaccomplish and could usher in new periods of unrest,particularly in Soviet republics eager to exercise autonomy.   &quot;There is no stability in the country at the moment, werecognize that fact,&quot; said Foreign Minister AlexanderBessmertnykh. Restoring coherence to the economy andgovernment is &quot;the greatest task facing us.&quot;   Mr. Gorbachev's future role in bringing about stability isuncertain. Late last night, he returned to Moscow from theCrimea, where he was vacationing when the coup occurred andwhere he spent the last three days under house arrest. Onarriving at the Moscow airport, Mr. Gorbachev stepped downthe stairs from his plane, shook hands with waiting aides andwas taken by motorcade to his home.   In a subsequent television broadcast, a tanned andvigorous-looking Mr. Gorbachev called the failure of the coup&quot;a great victory for perestroika.&quot; He proclaimed his respectfor the Soviet people and, specifically, Mr. Yeltsin and saidhe had been &quot;surrounded&quot; by troops during his house arrest.&quot;They wanted to break the will of the president and hisfamily,&quot; he said. &quot;But they lost, it just didn't happen.&quot; Mr.Gorbachev said he would describe the details of his housearrest at a later time when he convenes a &quot;broad conference&quot;of Soviet leaders.   But the 60-year-old Soviet president may be surprised bythe circumstances that greet him today, for the balance ofpolitical power in the country has shifted clearly in Mr.Yeltsin's favor. Thanks to his popular mandate, the feistyMr. Yeltsin was able to withstand the very forces thatdeposed Mr. Gorbachev, his longtime rival.   As a result, many people in Moscow are starting to talkabout Mr. Gorbachev in the past tense, predicting he willplay a more symbolic than substantive role in the future.Some even contend that he will stay on only briefly as aninterim figure, and then be forced out by public opinion. Mr.Gorbachev himself helped bring about the coup, these peopleargue, because he elevated most of its ringleaders to highposts in his government and kept them there despite direwarnings from both his detractors and supporters.   &quot;Gorbachev created the possibilities for such a coup totake place,&quot; says Valery Lunin, a chemistry professor atMoscow University and member of the Russian Parliament. &quot;Heshould resign, although perhaps not at once, and allowelections to be held.&quot;   Mr. Gorbachev's future now rests largely in his own hands.If he acts decisively to punish the leaders of the coup andpurge his administration of their supporters, he could regainsome of his popularity, which eroded as the economy worsenedin recent years. But any wavering -- something he has doneoften -- could relegate him to a minor role.   Whatever he does, the Soviet Union seems headed for aperiod of fundamental change that could have a major impacton the way it deals with the outside world. Mr. Yeltsin, 60,is expected to press relentlessly for the Kremlin torelinquish most of its administrative powers to theincreasingly assertive republics. For the nation as a whole,that could create considerable upheaval as newly &quot;sovereign&quot;republics attempt to build a federal system from the bottomup.   For the West, the problem of balancing relations with theKremlin and with individual Soviet republics is likely toworsen. Mr. Yeltsin himself, who has sought a greater voicein international affairs, clearly relished his contacts withworld leaders during the crisis. He told the RussianParliament Wednesday of his conversations with heads of stateranging from President Bush to France's Francois Mitterrandand British Prime Minister John Major, proclaiming proudlythat &quot;they all support the Russian leadership.&quot;   The 64-hour coup disintegrated with astonishing speed.After seizing power and deposing Mr. Gorbachev at 4 a.m.Monday, the eight-man committee headed by Vice PresidentGennady Yanayev and including the Soviet prime minister, thedefense minister, the interior minister and the KGB chief,soon found the tables turning.   By Tuesday the regime was under fierce verbal attack notjust from Mr. Yeltsin, but from tens of thousands of Sovietprotesters, the leaders of many republics, and thegovernments of virtually every country in the world. Theloyalty of the army was being sorely tested; a handful ofdivisions switched sides to protect the Russian leadership inits parliament building. Even hard-liners who had beenexpected to support the junta condemned it for what theycalled its &quot;illegal&quot; actions.   Tuesday night, hundreds of unarmed volunteers stoodoutside the white parliament building on the Moskva river,nervous about rumors of an imminent armed assault. It nevercame. At least three civilians were killed in a brief clasharound midnight, when a column of six light tanks stormed abarricade near the parliament. But the troops quickly backedoff, and the rest of the night was quiet.   The Russian Parliament convened for an emergency sessionWednesday, and after three hours of debate, Mr. Yeltsinsuddenly announced that the coup leaders were &quot;heading to theairport for an unknown destination.&quot; Amid growing excitement,he ordered them to be stopped.   Around the same time, the hundreds of tanks and armoredcars positioned around the Soviet capital started towithdraw. Russian officials said top Defense Ministry andgeneral staff brass had issued the order after a briefmeeting.   Within hours, a delegation of two Russian republicofficials and four Gorbachev aides flew to the Crimea to meetwith the Soviet president. He had been held incommunicadosince the beginning of the coup, guarded by 32 KGB officerswith machine guns in his spacious yellow dacha in Foros, atthe southern tip of the peninsula.   The hard-line regime had justified its takeover by sayingthat Mr. Gorbachev was incapacitated by poor health. Theofficials quickly discovered otherwise. Arkady Volsky, aGorbachev aide, declared the health problems &quot;a grossinvention.&quot; He also reported that the coup had taken placeafter the eight-man committee had tried and failed topressure Mr. Gorbachev into signing a statement imposing astate of emergency on the nation.   By 8 p.m., the coup was officially over and Mr. Gorbachevannounced he was &quot;in full control of the situation and {had}restored contact with the country, broken off as a result ofthe adventurist actions of a group of state officials.&quot; Aftertelephone conversations with leaders of five of the 15 Sovietrepublics and with President Bush, Mr. Gorbachev headed forMoscow from the Crimea.   Even before the coup ended, the nation started returningto normal. Soviet television, which had been broadcasting adiet of classical music and black-and-white patriotic moviesthroughout the previous two days, suddenly switched toshowing the Russian Parliament session. Russian radio resumedits broadcasts, and all restrictions on the media werelifted. In Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, Soviet troopsretreated from television and radio stations they occupiedearlier in the week.   The situation in the Baltic states remained tense,however: According to news wire reports, gunfire was reportedin Vilnius, Lithuania, where one person was shot dead, and aLatvian died from injuries received when the Soviets thisweek took over the radio station where he worked. Some U.S.analysts are predicting that the coup and the forces it hasunleashed have dramatically increased the chances that theBaltic states will win their independence. During the coup,Estonia and Latvia unilaterally declared their independence,a move Lithuania took last year but which Soviet troopsthwarted.   The Soviet federal prosecutor's office, meanwhile,announced that it had started criminal proceedings againstthe eight coup leaders. At one point early yesterday, therewere reports that four of the eight had flown to Mr.Gorbachev's vacation home in the Crimea to make a personalappeal to him. But this couldn't be confirmed. Last night,Reuter reported that Alexander Rutskoi, the vice president ofthe Russian republic, said one plotter, Vladimir Kryuchkov,chairman of the KGB, had been arrested and would be tried.The whereabouts of the other seven leaders of the coup wasn'timmediately known.   As news of the rapid developments spread, hundreds ofjubilant Russians braved the rain and streamed toward theparliament building, which was bedecked in the Russian white,blue and red national tricolor. &quot;We can say that today is thelast day of Soviet Communism, and it's a rainy one,&quot; oneparliament deputy, Yevgeny Ambartsumov, shouted down to thecrowd from a first-floor balcony. &quot;Yeltsin, Yeltsin,&quot; thecrowd shouted back.   But some were already looking to the future, and soundingmore cautious. &quot;A 70-year nightmare doesn't end thatquickly,&quot; said Nikolai Medvedev, a member of the nationalparliament.   As the future takes shape for the Soviet Union, one thingis certain: U.S. relations with the country will never be thesame.   Over the last three days, Mr. Bush became a vocal partnerof Mr. Yeltsin's in the effort to oust the Communisthardliners who launched the coup. The U.S. now seems to bemoving inexorably toward recognizing the charismatic Russianleader as the rising force in the Soviet Union. Mr. Bush, whohas struggled for two years to balance relations between hisfriend Mr. Gorbachev and the unabashedly pro-Western Mr.Yeltsin, confirmed that relations with Mr. Yeltsin will nowbe different. &quot;They have taken a quantum leap forward now bythis man's displayed courage and by his commitment todemocracy,&quot; he said at a press conference.   By moving closer to Mr. Yeltsin, the U.S. inevitably willalso be moving closer to his vision for the Soviet Union,which sees the U.S.S.R. as a political umbrella but Russiaand the other Soviet republics with vastly expanded freedomsand power; some republics, particularly the Baltic states,would acquire their complete independence from Moscow. Thetriumph of Mr. Yeltsin is also likely to give new impetus toproposals for truly radical shock therapy for the Sovieteconomy, which Mr. Gorbachev avoided.   But a new relationship with Mr. Yeltsin doesn't mean Mr.Bush will abandon his friendship with Mr. Gorbachev. In fact,their personal bond was evident yesterday when Mr. Bush spokewith the Soviet leader by phone.   Mr. Bush was in his boat in the waters off his vacationhome in Maine when Mr. Gorbachev finally was able to returnthe repeated calls Mr. Bush had made during the coup. Mr.Bush went ashore and took the call in the bedroom of hishome, with Barbara Bush at his side. Later, he told aides theconversation was an emotional one in which Mr. Gorbachev waseffusive in his thanks for American support during theunrest.   &quot;The personal thing kicked in,&quot; says one administrationofficial. &quot;It was emotional for both of them.&quot; Later, anobviously relieved Mr. Bush declared that &quot;freedom anddemocracy have prevailed.&quot; And he insisted that there isn'tany &quot;Gorbachev versus Yeltsin battle.&quot;   Moreover, it isn't just Mr. Bush who still has a stronglink to Mr. Gorbachev. If anything, West European leadershave been even more committed to Mr. Gorbachev. They worryabout any push for radical Soviet changes that might producechaos and instability on their eastern borders -- and apossible halt to the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Germansoil.   That means that an American drift closer to Mr. Yeltsinisn't risk-free. It could produce strains and differences inapproach between Washington and its European allies if thedrift is too pronounced.   Still, there probably isn't any way for Mr. Bush to avoidmoving closer to the policies and tactics Mr. Yeltsinespouses. &quot;Boris Yeltsin's actions during this coup attempt-- his courage and his ability to exercise charismaticleadership -- offer the greatest possible hope of someleadership for the future,&quot; said Sen. Richard Lugaryesterday. &quot;My own view is that, by and large, Gorbachev is aspent force.&quot;   As it became apparent that the coup was falling apart,some of those in the Soviet Union who had supported it rushedfor cover. Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov, a member of theeight-man committee, was said by his deputy to have agreed totake part in the coup because &quot;he had been misled by theinformation on the state of health of the Soviet president.&quot;   Senior officials of the Soviet Communist Party, which isbelieved to have played a supporting role in the takeover,quickly distanced themselves from the coup leaders anddeclared the action to have been unlawful. Sensing thatreprisals could be in the air, they also warned againstjumping to hasty conclusions about who is guilty. &quot;Someforces will probably try to use the situation to strike ablow at the Soviet Communist Party,&quot; said Sergei Kalashnikov,a nervous secretary of the party's central committee. He saidthe coup leaders shouldn't be described as a &quot;junta,&quot; butacknowledged that they had &quot;blundered in a difficultsituation.&quot;   In fact, both sympathizers and opponents of the coup wereunited in a belief that the whole affair had been handledwith extraordinary clumsiness. The emergency committeeclearly failed to anticipate the fierce reaction from Mr.Yeltsin and the general public. And once it came, it seemedat a loss as to how to deal with it and lacked the nerve tocarry out a bloody assault on the Russian Parliament, thefocus of protest.   &quot;We must admit that mistakes by the junta let us gatherpeople and continue disseminating information,&quot; said GlebYakunin, a Russian Orthodox priest and reform-minded memberof the Russian Parliament.   The coup leaders also alienated some potential hard-lineallies by saying they planned to continue with Mr.Gorbachev's policies. &quot;The committee was created because ofthe catastrophic situation in the country caused byGorbachev's policies,&quot; said Col. Viktor Alksnis, a critic ofthe Soviet president and leader of the Soyuz parliamentarygroup. &quot;But Yanayev publicly praised Gorbachev. If he {Mr.Gorbachev} was so good, where was the need to get rid ofhim?&quot;   According to several sources, Marshal Dmitri Yazov, thedefense minister and a member of the eight-man committee, mayhave played an important role in bringing about the coup'scollapse. He appears to have had major reservations aboutordering troops to attack the parliament building. &quot;It seemsto me that Yazov was just sucked into a political game. Hedidn't want bloodshed,&quot; said Konstantin Kobets, the head ofthe Russian defense committee who is well connected with thearmy's general staff.   The future of the entire army now seems certain to becomea serious point of contention as Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Gorbachevand leaders of the other republics move to build a newfederal structure.   Until the failed coup, there had been a tacit agreement topreserve a single army. But the events of the past few dayshave driven home to Mr. Yeltsin and his aides how vulnerablethey are without some defense force of their own. Mr. Kobetsand other top Russian officials now talk about the need toform a Russian national guard. And some radicals want Mr.Yeltsin to take another, far more critical look at the entireunion treaty he, Mr. Gorbachev and two other republicanleaders had been expected to sign on Tuesday. The treaty isdesigned to transfer some powers from the central governmentto the republics, and is believed to have precipitated thecoup.   &quot;Many Russian deputies say they don't want the treaty tobe signed as it stands,&quot; says Sergei Belosertsev, a reformistmember of the republic's legislature. &quot;The latest events showhow much still has to be done, including the clauses on thearmy. Yeltsin will be wiser after the {coup}. He was in toomuch of a hurry before.&quot;   Whatever the fate of the union treaty, Mr. Yeltsin isalready confident about one of its key economic clauses. Hetold the Russian Parliament that if the treaty had beensigned, President Gorbachev would have immediately handedover jurisdiction of all factories in Russia to the republic.As it turned out, Mr. Yeltsin went ahead and ordered thetransfer himself. He also stole a march on the Sovietpresident by firing the head of state-run TV, a notorioushard-liner.   For many Russians, though, yesterday was a time tocelebrate, not to worry about the future. As barricades beganto come down, the libations came out. &quot;I'm drunk,&quot; saidStepan Kisilyov, deputy editor of the reformist weekly,Moscow News, which was banned during the coup. Speaking overthe phone in the early hours of Thursday morning, he added:&quot;The whole editorial board has been drinking cognac allnight.
