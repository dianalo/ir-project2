Ride, on Thursday challenged the Bushadministration argument that nuclear-tipped sea-launched cruisemissiles cannot be detected on vessels.   In an article in Science Magazine, the scientists endorsed aSoviet argument that a total ban on those missiles could beverified under a proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START)now under superpower negotiation.   ``The verification of arms control limits on nuclear-armed SLCMs(sea-launched cruise missiles) does not present insuperableproblems and can be accomplished at a level of both effectivenessand intrusiveness, which is likely to be characteristic of theother verification provisions of START,'' said the article by Rideand fellow physcists George N. Lewis and John S. Townsend.   Ride left the shuttle program and is a professor of physics atthe University of California at San Diego.   Matt Murphy, a spokesman for the U.S. Arms Control andDisarmament Agency, said officials were studying the article andhad no immediate comment.   Navy officers in particular have opposed including the missilesin START because they do not want Soviet inspectors aboard U.S.submarines and because they say it would be easy to circumvent aban or reduction.   The article contested that contention, proposing a detailed planto inspect missiles at their point of origin, tag and seal them,and provide for inspections no more intrusive than othersenvisioned under START.   Last September, the Soviets withdrew their insistence that thesea-launched cruise missile ban be included in START, but said theywanted a separate SLCM deal.   Bush administration officals have said a START pact, to reducesuperpower nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent, might beready by the time of a planned summit next spring or summer.   The United States has approximately 370 nuclear and 1,670long-range Tomahawk sea-launched cruise missiles that can be firedfrom about 70 U.S. surface ships and submarines and have a range ofabout 1,600 miles, the article said.   The Soviet Union has an estimated 400 short-range nuclear SLCMsand has deployed a smaller number of nuclear SS-N-21 missiles, witha range of about 1,800 miles, it said.   The article said that such missiles ``cannot be readily, orsafely, moved about or hidden on such ships.''   ``Furthermore, conversion of a Tomahawk from conventional tonuclear, although technically feasible, would be a complex andtime-consuming operation that, pratically speaking, could beperformed only at a factory,'' it said.   ``Considerations such as these, taken together, suggest thatSLCM verification is not the intractable problem it is oftenpresented to be and that effective monitoring of SLCM deploymentsis possible without an unprecedented degree of intrusiveness,'' itsaid.   ``Inspecting, tagging and sealing of SLCMs would be carried outin a special verification facility,'' it said.   At each facility, superpower inspectors would assure thatmissiles were not nuclear and could not be changed at sea. Gammaray levels from nuclear-armed SLCMs are sufficient to alertinspectors to deception, it said.   Additionally, it said, scientists at the U.S. Sandia NationalLaboratory had developed a tag that could give each missile adistinctive ``fingerprint'' that would be read by shining a lightat it from different angles.   Similarly, it said, a tamperproof seal consisting of opticfibers had been developed to allow inspectors to assure that amissile had not been armed with a nuclear warhead.   To break the ban, it said, ``a potential cheater'' would have tobuild a secret production facility, conduct clandestine tests, andcovertly transport and deploy the missiles.   ``Each of these steps would involve risks. Collectively theywould represent a substantial level of activity, which would bedifficult to hide,'' it said.   Moreover, it said, ``the military significance of covertlyproduced nuclear SLCMs should not be exaggerated. Nuclear-armedSLCMs would need to be hidden on land rather than at sea, and ``ina rapidly developing crisis, covert SLCMs would not be availablefor use.''   ``There would be little incentive to attempt such cheating,since doing so would provide little in the way of reliable,available military capabilities that are not already provided byother weapons. ...'' it said.</TEXT></DOC>
