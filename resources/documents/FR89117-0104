Cook Nuclear Plant, Unit No. 1 (the facility), located inBerrien County, Michigan. In accordance with the licensee's application for amendment dated August9, 1988, the amendment would allow a one-time extension of the surveillanceintervals for certain surveillances normally performed with the unit shutdown.The extensions involve: 1. Ice basket weighing; 2. Ice condenser flow passage inspections; 3. Ice condenser inlet door testing; and 4. Resistance temperature detector calibrations. Prior to issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission willhave made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended(the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commision has made a proposed determination that the amendment requestinvolves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulationsin 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordancewith the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The Commission's evaluation of the proposed amendment with respect to theabove criteria is as follows: <ITAG tagnum="84">Criterion 1 </ITAG>The period of time the surveillance intervals will be exended is very brief.The surveillances for which extensions are requested fall due from February26, 1989, through March 26, 1989. Extensions are necessary only until theCycle 10-11 refueling outage, which is scheduled to begin in March 1989.The licensee has reviewed previous surveillance test results for the affectedequipment and has found nothing that would indicate the equipment may becomeinoperable as a result of the extensions. Therefore, the extensions arenot expected to significantly increase the probability or consequencesof a previously analyzed accident. <ITAG tagnum="84">Criteron 2 </ITAG>The requested extensions will not result in a change in plant configurationor operation and therefore would not be expected to create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzedor evaluated. <ITAG tagnum="84">Criterion 3 </ITAG>As discussed under Criterion 1, the requested extension period is verybrief. The licensee has reviewed previous surveillance test results andfound nothing which would indicate that the affected equipment would becomeinoperable as a result of the proposed surveillance interval extensions.Therefore, the proposed amendment is not expected to involve a significantreduction in a margin of safety. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that the proposed amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By February 16, 1988, the licensee may file a request for a hearing withrespect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operatinglicense and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceedingand who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file awritten request for hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requestsfor a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordancewith the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings''in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to interveneis filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safetyand Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition, andthe Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board willissue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularlythe interest of the petitioner in the proceeding and how that interestmay be affected by the resultsof the proceeding. The petition should specificallyexplain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particularreference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner'sright under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the natureand extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest inthe proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be enteredin the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should alsoidentify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceedingas to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed apetition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party mayamend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to fifteen(15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding,but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirementsdescribed above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene, which must include a list of the contentions thatare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing heldwould take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received. Should the Commission take thisaction, it will publish a notice of issuance and provide for opportunityfor a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to takethis action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervne must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW.,Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during thelast ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitionerpromptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to WesternUnion at 1-800-325-6000 (in Missouri 1-800-342-6700). The Western Unionoperator should be given Datagram Identification Number 3737 and the followingmessage addresed to Theodore R. Quay: (petitioner's name and telephonenumber); (date petition was mailed); (plant name), and (publication dateand page number of this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice).
