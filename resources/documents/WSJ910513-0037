With about 20 employees and initial assets of $300 millionto $400 million, the reorganized Drexel was referred to asNewco in the accord. The firm will be owned by its creditorsas well as investors and others with claims pending againstthe company for alleged securities-law violations.</LP><TEXT>   The settlement comes after 15 months of complicatednegotiations between Drexel's creditors andsecurities-litigation claimants over how to split up thefirm's assets. Drexel, once the most profitable U.S.securities firm with nearly 11,000 employees, filed forprotection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code inFebruary 1990. The firm has total fixed liabilities of $2.5billion and about $2.6 billion in assets, including more than$1 billion in cash.   The accord outlines terms of a reorganization plan, whichmust be approved by a majority of the creditors and the courtbefore the firm can emerge from bankruptcy proceedings. Incarving up the Drexel assets, the plan allows for more than$2 billion to be distributed among the firm's thousands ofcreditors and other claimants.   The plan also resolves all securities-law litigationpending against the firm, including the Federal DepositInsurance Corp.'s $11.3 billion claim for thrift lossesallegedly stemming from high-risk, high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bondsunderwritten by Drexel. In Washington, the FDIC and theResolution Trust Corp., the thrift-bailout agency, said theyexpect to receive several hundred million dollars under theaccord.   In a statement, U.S. District Court Judge Milton Pollack,who presides over the case in federal court in Manhattan,said the vast majority of Drexel's assets will be placed intoa liquidating trust owned by the creditors and the claimantsin litigation against the firm. Three trustees, acceptable toall claimants, will run the trust. They, in turn, willdesignate a managing agent, whose job it will be to defendthe trust against any new claims and to make as much money aspossible from selling the assets.   The firm's fixed creditors, which are banks, insurancecompanies, and pension funds that were owed money when Drexelwent belly up, will get paid as the trust disposes of thefirm's liquid assets. These assets include stock in othercompanies, junk bonds, and investment-banking loans made toclients.   The trust will also distribute a portion of its funds tothe securities-law litigants, including thrift regulators andinvestors who claimed damages stemming from Drexel's allegedsecurities-law violations. But a big source of restitutionfor this group will be funds recovered in previoussettlements.   This pot includes the $400 million restitution fundMichael Milken, Drexel's former junk bond chief, agreed topay to settle an SEC civil suit last year. There is also a$350 million fund set up by Drexel when it settled an SECcivil suit in 1989.   An individual familiar with the settlement said that underits terms the securities litigants have agreed to release allcurrent Drexel employees from liability. Also, in an unusualprovision, the creditors and litigants have agreed to joinforces in suing other parties, such as former Drexelofficials who allegedly profited from wrongdoing at theclaimants' expense. A percentage of the recovery will befunneled into the trust.   More details of the plan are expected to be made publictoday. Individuals knowledgeable about the case said the planrequires the securities-law claimants, especially the FDIC,to significantly slash their claims against the firm.   Earlier this year Judge Pollack threatened to forceDrexel's liquidation if the parties did not voluntarilyreduce their claims in order to facilitate Drexel'sreorganization.   The only issue still unresolved is the Internal RevenueService's claim for $5.28 billion, filed in February. The IRSis seeking back taxes, interest and penalties for the years1980 through 1990. The case is scheduled for trial in federalcourt in New York in June.   In his statement, Judge Pollack said that the proposedsettlement is &quot;subject to the pending IRS claim beingresolved at a level satisfactory&quot; to the creditors andlitigants. An individual knowledgeable about the case saidthe settlement will fall through if the IRS's claim isresolved at an amount deemed too high by the other claimants.Tax claims generally take precedence over other claims inChapter 11 reorganizations.   Judge Pollack said that he expected the reorganizationplan to be confirmed by the end of 1991.   Lawyers involved in the bankruptcy case did not returncalls or declined to comment prior to a news conferencescheduled for today.</TEXT></DOC>
