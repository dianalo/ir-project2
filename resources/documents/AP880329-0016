With Easter and Passover coming up this weekend, lamb productionin the first quarter may reach about 80 million pounds and thendrop back to around 78 million pounds in the second quarter,according to the department's Economic Research Service.   ``Lambs on feed (for the slaughter market) were up 18 percent onJan. 1, 1988,'' the report said. ``These supplies should beavailable during the first half of the year and could pushproduction up about 6 percent.''   Lamb and mutton take a far-back seat with American consumers butare still an important part of the U.S. food and agriculturalsector. This year, for example, per capita consumption may be about1.4 pounds, compared with an average of around 83 pounds ofpoultry, 72 pounds of beef, 63 pounds of pork and 1.5 pounds ofveal.   The Jan. 1 inventory of all sheep and lambs in the United Statesrose 4 percent from a year earlier to 10.8 million head, whichagency economists said represented ``the second year of expansionfollowing several years of profitability'' in the sheep business.   ``The West showed the biggest increases in the ewe flock, about6 percent above a year ago,'' they said in the April issue ofAgricultural Outlook magazine. ``In the Great Plains, sheepinventories increased a little over 2 percent from a year ago. Mostof this expansion occurred outside of Texas, which has the largestinventory of any state.''   Analysts said they were surprised by a decline in the sheep andlamb inventory east of the Rocky Mountains, including a 4 percentdrop in the North Central states. The Southeast was down 5 percenton Jan. 1 after a 12 percent increase a year earlier.   But the declines in the inventories were not sharp enough tooffset larger numbers elsewhere, which the West and the GreatPlains made up most of the breeding flock.   Lamb prices averaged about $78 per 100 pounds, liveweight, lastyear, up from around $69 in 1986. Market prices may declinesomewhat in 1988, however, according to USDA projections.   Although lambs are a major part of the sheep business, so iswool. And the rise in inventories boosted shorn wool production in1987 to 85.8 million pounds, up 1 percent from 1986. That was thefirst year-to-year increase since 1981, when shorn wool output roseto 109.8 million pounds from 105.4 million in 1980.   Wool output peaked at 388 million pounds in World War II beforebeginning its decline, reflecting the long-term slide in U.S. sheepproduction.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Agriculture Department scientists are hopefulthat one of the costliest crop pests of farmers and home gardenersmay one day be curbed by a natural enemy, a microscopic killer wormthat searches the soil for the corn rootworm.   The tiny worm, or nematode, is called Steinernema feltiae. Afterinfecting the rootworm, the nematode releases a bacterium thatkills the pest. Then, said USDA entomologist Jan J. Jackson, thenematode uses the larva's body as a place to reproduce while itfeasts on bacteria and larva tissue.   About 10 days later, hundreds of new nematodes emerge and startsearching for more rootworms.   ``That gives you an advantage over chemical controls,'' he saidMonday in a report by the department's Agricultural ResearchService. ``A chemical just sits there and waits for the rootworm tocome to it. The nematode doesn't wait.''   But Jackson found that the nematodes don't persist in the groundlong enough to eliminate a rootworm infestation. In one field trialwhere he works at the department's Northern Grain Insects ReseachLaboratory, Brookings, S.D., Jackson applied 100,000 nematodes tothe base of each of several corn plants, reducing rootworm damage11 percent   Jackson said that is not an acceptable level of control, but heexpects further research could lead to protection as good as fromchemical insecticides. A separate test with a chemical reduced rootdamage 44 percent.   Rootworm larvae destroy corn roots, and adults feed on theleaves, tassels and ears. Jackson said U.S. corn producers spendnearly $350 million a year to fight the rootworms. Nematodesprobably could be produced at about the same cost, without the riskof chemical injury to farmers and the environment.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Kansas firm has been licensed by theAgriculture Department to market a genetically engineered vaccineto control pseudorabies in swine, a contagious disease that can bedeadly to newborn pigs.   The vaccine will be marketed by SyntroVet Inc., Lenexa, Kan.,said James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal andPlant Health Inspection Service. He said Monday the new vaccine isthe third live genetically engineered product licensed by thedepartment for pseudorabies vaccination.   ``We have concluded the new vaccine is both safe andeffective,'' Glosser said. ``Our scientists have reviewed andanalyzed the procedures used to develop the vaccine, its biologicaland safety characteristics, and the safety and effectiveness datagathered during field trials in three states.''   Further, he said, an environmental assessment concluded that useof the vaccine would have ``no significant impact on the humanenvironment.''   ``During field trials, the new vaccine was administered to morethan 400 swine, including baby pigs, weaned pigs and sows,''Glosser said. ``No adverse reactions were noted.''   Pseudorabies, also known as Aujesky's disease or mad itch, doesnot affect humans. Although the disease caused an estimated $22million in losses to the swine industry last year, it is not apublic health problem, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
