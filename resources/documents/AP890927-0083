Among the marchers were the white managing director of theMercedes-Benz auto manufacturing plant in East London and many ofthe company's black employees, who were given the day off toparticipate.   The rally for ``justice, peace and freedom'' was organized by 20local anti-aparthied groups as part of a nationwide protestcampaign launched in early August. The demonstrations have targetedsegregated schools, hospitals, beaches, buses and other facilities.   Police estimated today's crowd at between 25,000 and 40,000, andjournalists at the scene gave similar estimates.   The largest previous government-approved rally was a march indowntown Cape Town two weeks ago by an estimated 20,000 to 25,000people.   In other developments, authorities released a prominentanti-apartheid activist who had been on a hunger strike, and thecity of Johannesburg formally opened all public facitilies toblacks.   There have been a series of mass demonstrations across thecountry since President F.W. de Klerk announced Sept. 13 thatauthorities would not break up lawful, peaceful protests.   The East London rally was led by David Russell, the AnglicanArchbishop of Grahamstown, along with other local clerics and humanrights lawyers.   The rally clogged the entire downtown area and most shops closedfor the day. Marchers danced, chanted and sang freedom songs, andsome carried the green, gold and black flag of the outlawed AfricanNational Congress guerrilla movement.   Leaders of the rally marched to the headquarters of the securitypolice and presented written demands that call for the release ofpolitical prisoners, the legalization of banned opposition groupsand the lifting of the 3-year-old state of emergency.   There was a heavy police presence at the rally, includingarmored vehicles and a helicopter, but officers stood aside and noincidents were reported.   All the approved mass rallies in the past two weeks have beenpeaceful except for some minor looting at a march last week in thesoutheastern city of Pietermaritzburg. In Pretoria, police usedclubs Saturday to disperse some women trying to proceed with aprotest march that was not authorized.   In Johannesburg, white students at Rand Afrikaans Universityjeered and heckled about 200 black students who marched today toprotest the segregated dormitories. About 75 percent of thestudents at the overwhelmingly white university voted last week tomaintain segregated residences, the black students said.   In another development, authorities released a prominentanti-apartheid activist who went on a hunger strike after beingdetained without charge last month, his attorney said.   Trevor Manuel, who was freed Tuesday, is one of the top-rankingleaders in Cape Town of the banned United Democratic Front, thecountry's largest anti-apartheid coalition.   Manuel, who has been detained previously, was held in thecentral city of Bloemfontein and refused to eat for two weeks ofhis 30-day confinement, attorney Essa Moosa said.   Before his most recent detention, Manuel was under policerestrictions that limited his movements. Moosa said he did not knowif any new restrictions had been placed on his client.   Many activists have ignored the police orders as part of thenationwide defiance campaign.   The government released hundreds of detainees earlier this yearafter they launched a hunger strike, and only a few dozen werebeing held without charge in June and July.   However, a human rights groups estimate that the number hasrisen to about 250. More than 30,000 people have been detainedwithout charge for varying lengths of time under the 3-year-oldstate of emergency.   In Johannesburg, meanwhile, the city formally opened all publicfacilities to blacks today after the city council voted todesegregate buses, swimming pools and recreation centers.</TEXT></DOC>
