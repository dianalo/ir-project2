Jack N. Polevoi, 41 years old, faces as long as 16 years in prison and $1 million in fines. Federal prosecutors said he admitted conspiring to launder $712,000; conspiring to sell ZZZZ Best shares short on illegal inside information, for a profit of $225,000; and failing to report $53,000 on his 1985 and 1986 federal tax returns.    Charges against his twin brother, Jerry, have yet to be resolved. In addition, four of the 12 original ZZZZ Best defendants are to be tried in August.    The now-defunct ZZZZ Best was founded as a carpet-cleaning company by entrepreneur Barry Minkow; it reached a market value exceeding $210 million, but most of its fire-damage and water-damage restoration jobs turned out to be fake. Robert Bonner, the local U.S. Attorney, called it &quot;the most massive and elaborate securities fraud perpetrated on the West Coast in over a decade,&quot; with estimated losses exceeding $50 million.    Mr. Minkow, 22, is in jail awaiting trial on fraud, racketeering and money-laundering charges. </TEXT></DOC>
