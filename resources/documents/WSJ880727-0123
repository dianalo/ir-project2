But it will hardly be peace for the peoples who remain under the control of oppressive regimes -- or for the refugees the region's many years of war and tyranny have spawned.    As William McGurn writes on the page opposite, recent months have witnessed a new surge of desperate people fleeing Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. (See &quot;Dishonest Deterrence: Redefining the Refugee&quot; -- WSJ July 27,1988) Foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- made up of six non-communist countries of the region -- earlier this month said the renewed outflow requires a &quot;new approach.&quot; It certainly does, but not the hard-nosed one they are adopting.    Not much help comes from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Originally set up to aid peoples displaced by World War II and Nazi totalitarianism, its mandate later was expanded to include victims of other tyrannies, mainly communism. But somewhere along the way it lost its sense of mission. Voluntary refugee workers from Peshawar to Bangkok to Hong Kong complain that UNHCR field offices are worried more about offending governments than speaking up for refugees.    Recent developments on the Indochina front attest to that. When Thailand began turning away boat people in January, the UNHCR hemmed and hawed instead of shouting murder and getting trucks and boats down to the spots with provisions, something the private refugee agencies did. Later it signed a memorandum of understanding with the Thai government in which UNHCR agreed that subsequent arrivals would be sent to Site 2 near the Cambodian border and not considered for resettlement.    When Hong Kong announced that new arrivals would be considered illegal immigrants and not real refugees until they could prove otherwise, the UNHCR's primary concern was being allowed to rubber-stamp the decisions. It continues to emphasize &quot;voluntary repatriation.&quot; Put it this way: If you were out there on a leaky boat, how would you feel about the UNHCR bargaining away your chances for freedom and a better life?    One ought to be able to expect more of an organization with program expenditures set at $407 million for 1988. Yet the UNHCR reflects the problem of the U.N. bureaucracy itself. Though it has not become the anti-Western, pro-Soviet organization that UNESCO did under Amadou M'Bow, major donors should question whether they are getting their money's worth. Of the agency's 2,000 employees, one out of every three sits in Geneva. The U.S. contributes about a quarter of UNHCR's budget.    With the ASEAN countries closing their borders and UNHCR no longer effective, the U.S. has an opportunity to demonstrate that it pays more than lip service to the cause of freedom and democracy. One approach worth considering is an adaptation of the Joint Voluntary Agency program, by which the U.S. State Department contracts with private agencies to process immigrant and refugee applications. This in a sense privatizes aid. It allows more on-the-spot initiatives and avoids bureaucracy. Most important, it gets money to the people who are out there really trying to do the job rather than sitting in Geneva.    We don't know how long it might take to negotiate a political settlement for Cambodia, even if such is possible. But even success would not do much immediately to change the desperate circumstances throughout Indochina. The murderous Khmer Rouge are still a factor in Cambodia and the government in Hanoi practices totalitarianism with the same vigor as always. Boat people will continue their efforts to escape. It is unconscionable to talk of sending refugees back to such tyrannies after they have risked their lives for freedom.    Any reforms in aid management will have to be coupled with a further willingness by the U.S., Canada, Australia and Europe to accept refugees. (Japan has given money but, for what can be viewed largely as racial reasons, rarely a home.) This does not demand national sacrifice. People with the courage and energy to flee tyrannies become democracy's most ardent defenders.    It is to be hoped that the Indonesian talks will succeed. But the more pressing task is to give the boat people a better shake than they are now getting. Peace talks won't make their problems go away. </TEXT></DOC>
