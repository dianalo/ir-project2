Talk fast. Very fast.    Almost all hotels use timers to charge for calls from guest rooms. The timers, though, don't click on until about 45 seconds after the caller picks up the phone. So fast-dialing and fast-talking guests can make some long-distance calls for free.    &quot;If you call home and say 'I'm here,' and hang up immediately, you probably won't be charged,&quot; admits Stephen Weisz, senior vice president at Marriott Hotels andamp; Resorts. &quot;I wouldn't want that to get much publicity, but it's true.&quot;    Mr. Weisz says hotels simply haven't developed the technology to track calls more accurately. Lodging officials also point out that relatively few guests can finish calls so quickly.    What's more, hotels also benefit from timers. The timers don't detect when calls are actually connected; so guests can be charged for calls that never go through if the guest dials too slowly, or the phone rings long enough. (Hotels will remove such charges if the guests challenge them, but that rarely happens.)    &quot;You've got people beating the system with fast calls and people charged for calls they never made,&quot; says Ed Pemberton, a regional manager for Chervenak, Keane andamp; Co., a lodging-technology consulting firm. &quot;It all probably breaks out even in the end.&quot;    It May Be Time to Sell   Frequent-Flier Awards   THINKING ABOUT selling a frequent-flier award? Well, do it now.    That's the word from coupon brokers, who buy and sell these awards; they expect award values to fall sharply this year.    One reason, brokers say, is some airlines have filed lawsuits claiming that selling awards violates their rules; those suits have scared off many buyers. Also, airlines have made it increasingly easier over the years to win awards -- deflating their value.    Moreover, devaluation will worsen this year because most airlines have begun crediting frequent fliers with three times the mileage they actually fly.    &quot;By the end of the year, you'll have this huge oversupply of awards,&quot; says Lewis Spalding, executive editor of Bonus Bulletin magazine, which tracks awards. &quot;Now is the time to get out.&quot;    But if you do, how much can you get? Most brokers will pay between one and 1 1/2 cents for each mile earned; thus a 50,000-mile award, which is usually two free tickets to any U.S. city, fetches about $500 to $750.    The price, though, depends on which airline's award is sold; many brokers, for example, won't pay top dollar for Continental Airlines' and Eastern Airlines' awards because so many travelers have earned free trips on these carriers. Also, fliers with huge volumes of miles can usually negotiate for more than a penny and a half per mile.    Car-Rental Insurance:   Is It Really Necessary?    SEVERAL CREDIT-card companies recently began promoting a new service: Car-rental insurance.    For a lot of people, it probably isn't worth it.    For $29 a year, Air Travel Card members can receive, among other benefits, collision insurance for any car they rent with an Air Travel card. American Express offers similar protection for its &quot;gold&quot; and &quot;platinum&quot; card members; a gold card costs $65 a year, a platinum card costs $250 annually.    But many renters probably won't need the protection, says Harvey Seymour, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute. He estimates that 55% to 60% of drivers with auto-collision insurance will already be covered if they damage a rental car. Depending on how much coverage the driver has, the credit-card companies' insurance &quot;might be pretty worthless,&quot; he says.    American Express and Air Travel concede this, but say the service is still cheaper than the &quot;collision-damage waiver&quot; for which car-rental companies charge $9 a day.    &quot;We assumed the individual would check their insurance policy,&quot; before taking the added insurance, says an Air Travel spokeswoman.    No Boarding Pass?    This May Be Why   IF YOUR TRAVEL agent says he can't get a boarding pass on American Airlines, be suspicious.    That's because some agents, angry at American, are planning to issue fewer passes on it. Most fliers won't be able to determine when this is happening, since airlines only allocate a certain number of passes per flight.    What's got the agents so upset? For years, American paid them 50 cents for each boarding pass they issued on the airline's flights; the agent also had to be using American's reservation system. But to cut costs, American plans to stop those payments on Feb. 1.    Other airlines also don't pay for boarding passes, which allow travelers to select seats in advance. But travel agents insist they should be compensated for the time it takes to issue the passes.    &quot;There will probably be some backlash against American,&quot; says Dennis Sullivan, an automation committee member for the American Society of Travel Agents. &quot;The agent may say, 'Why go out of my way for American.'&quot;    Still, any boycott can't last forever. Most travelers are used to getting passes, and agents who repeatedly won't issue them would eventually lose business.    &quot;We would hope that (the boycott) wouldn't happen,&quot; says an American spokesman. &quot;But we still feel we're making the right move.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
