Judge Luther Alverson of Superior Court in Fulton County ruledFriday for the second time that only the General Assembly canregulate the sale of firearms. In July the judge blockedenforcement of an almost identical Fulton County ordinance.   Alverson said he would grant temporary restraining ordersagainst the City Council, police and Mayor Andrew Young.   Attorney Martha Glisson, a lawyer for Citizens for SafeGovernment, a gun-fanciers' group that challenged the law, arguedthat the local laws are so vague and broadly written that evensporting weapons could be considered illegal by police.   Assistant City Attorney Joe M. Harris argued that the cityordinance isn't preempted by state law because, he said, it goesfarther than any state legislation now on the books.   Both ordinances were aimed at limiting drug dealers' access toweapons like Uzi semiautomatic pistols, rifles and the AK-47assault rifle.</TEXT></DOC>
