<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-75-0208 </DOCNO><TEXT>Samples of a sodium heated heat exchanger tube with over 24,000 hoursservice at 310/sup 0/C were obtained and their thermal diffusivitiesmeasured over the temperature range 290 -700/sup 0/C. The effective thermalconductivity of the oxide layer was calculated from the results. It isproposed that the value obtained, 2.61 +- 0.45 Wm/sup -1/ /sup 0/C/sup-1/, can be used in calculations of the heat transfer in boilers.</TEXT></DOC>
