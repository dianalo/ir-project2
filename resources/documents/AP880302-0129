Tutu said Western nations should cut any diplomatic links withSouth Africa and expel South African diplomats from their countries.   ``Britain and America and West Germany have kept saying thatsanctions hurt blacks and sanctions are not effective,'' he said.``While not withdrawing my support for economic sanctions, I amsaying to Britain, West Germany and other Western countries, `Hereis your chance.'''   Tutu was in the Kenyan capital for a meeting of the All-AfricanConference of Churches, which he heads.   He said he has called in the past for Western governments tobreak relations with Pretoria. But he said this time he intended toactively campaign for such a move.   ``My own intention now is to challenge the West to break offdiplomatic relations with South Africa, to expel South Africandiplomats from their countries until certain conditions are met,''the churchman said.   Those conditions are a lifting of the state of emergency,reversal of a Feb. 25 ruling that outlawed political activity by 18opposition groups, and the release of political detainees,especially children.   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, and other churchmenwere arrested Monday when they attempted to march on the SouthAfrican Parliament at Cape Town to protest the crackdown on blackopposition groups.   The Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance ofReformed Churches, also was arrested. In an interview with ``CBSThis Morning'' from Harare, Zimbabwe, he said it is clear that thegovernment now is outlawing ``all legitimate peaceful activity,''and that apartheid opponents have no choice but to resist.   ``And if that means confrontation, if that means disobedience toyour unjust laws then I think that is exactly what we mean,'' hesaid. ``We are talking about the possibility of civildisobedience.''   He said non-violent protests have ended in deaths in the pastbut won't be a deterrent to civil disobedience.   ``We will have to take the risks that go with it and we willhave to take the consequences that follow these actions of ours,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
