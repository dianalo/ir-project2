The Census figures on state population, issued for releaseFriday, showed Nevadawith the biggest population gain at 18 percentfrom 1985 to the middle of 1989. Arizona had the second highestgrowth rate, at 12 percent, followed by Florida and New Hampshireat 11 percent and California at 10 percent.   Seven states lost population during the same period, the bureausaid: Iowa, North Dakota, Montana, West Virginia, Wyoming,Louisiana and Oklahoma.   The population figures are closely watched at the end of eachdecade because they determine how many seats in the U.S. House ofRepresentatives each state will have. The next reapportionment willbe based on the final 1990 Census figures, which will be collectedin the 10-year census next year.   The report issued Thursday represents one last checkpoint beforethat final, official count, and two forecasting groups on Thursdayissued revised reapportionment predictions based on the trends.   While the two reports varied on some specifics, they agreed onthe overall trend: states in the Sunbelt will generally pick upseats lost by states in the Northeast and Midwest.   The non-profit Population Reference Bureau said that if thetrends in Thursday's report hold true through the final 1990figures, 11 states are likely to lose one or more seats in Congresswhile seven will gain.   It said New York will lose three seats, Pennsylvania two, Ohiotwo, Michigan two, Illinois two, New Jersey one, Massachusetts one,Iowa one, Kansas one, West Virginia one and Montana one.   The Population Reference Bureau said California will gain sevenseats, Texas will gain three, Florida three, Virginia one, NorthCarolina one, Georgia one and Arizona one.   The comparable prediction by Election Data Services Inc., aWashington-based political consulting firm, differed only for a fewstates. It said Florida is likely to pick up four seats, ratherthan three, and it added Kentucky to the list of those losingseats, dropping one.   There is still a wild card in the deck which cannot, at thispoint, be predicted with certainty. The Census Bureau figures onwhich the projections are based do not include members of themilitary and their dependents living overseas.   The government recently announced that they will be counted inthe 1990 reapportionment. This change could tip the balance in somestates that now appear close to winning or losing a seat.</TEXT></DOC>
