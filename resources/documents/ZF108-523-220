Billington saidlibrary officials chose NFC to handle the payroll and personnel data for theagency's 5,400 employees because a new system would take three to four yearsto develop and install.andM;&quot;Our present 20-year-old semi-automated payroll system is in serious troubleand can only be maintained with great effort, and in any case cannot survivefor more than two years,&quot; he said.andM;The library plans to complete its conversion to the NFC systems in July at acost of $300,000.andP;  Library officials estimate the move will save between$780,000 and $1.3 million over a five-year period.andM;The Architect in 1988 wanted to contract Touche Ross andamp; Co., McLEan, Va., tointegrate its existing systems.andP;  But Congress refused to appropriate the$750,000 needed for fiscal 1989.andM;The company then raised the cost to $1.1 million, but GAO said this wouldsupport only development.andP;  The Architect would need an additional $1 millionannually to support and maintain the proposed new system to process data onthe agency's 2,240 employees, the report said.andM;Architect George White is reviewing a task force report and will make adecision soon, an agency spokesman said.andP;  White had told GAO he though thedecision would be made by mid-April.andM;GPO officials delayed their decision too, because they had to postponemeeting with NFC officials.andM;GPO officials first told GAO they would decide on an upgrade option by March15, but they were unable to visit NFC before the end of March, said James N.andO;Joyner, assistant public printer for administration and resources management.andM;Joyner said the task force would finish its report soon.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
