Western diplomats said groups of up to several hundred studentsgathered in the center of Rangoon. Official Rangoon Radio said sixstudents were arrested.   Up to 1,000 students gathered outside the gates of RangoonUniversity in an attempt to lay a wreath, but armed troops forcedthem to leave, said one diplomat who asked not to be identified byname.   Diplomats reported that soldiers blocked off some streets in aneffort to control the sporadic protests.   Leading opposition figure Aung San Suu Kyi, speaking to a crowdof several thousand in Rangoon, repeated her denunciations of theruling military for its refusal to hold talks with oppositiongroups, a witness said.   She spoke during a ceremony to remember a massacre of studentsafter the 1962 military coup and those killed during army crackdownson pro-democracy protests last year.   Dozens of students were killed when the military put down ademonstration at Rangoon University 26 years ago and blew up thestudent union building.   Several thousand were killed last year when troops crushed monthsof pro-democracy demonstrations.   Burma's former leader, Ne Win, is held responsible for orderingboth the 1962 and 1988 massacres. He officially relinquished controlin July 1988, but Suu Kyi has repeatedly charged that he is thepower behind the nominal head of state, Saw Maung.   Suu Kyi, general secretary of the largest oppostion group, theNational League for Democracy, has drawn big crowds that have defiedmartial law to hear her speak in Rangoon. Under existing militarylaw, gatherings of more than five people are forbidden.   ``General Saw Maung and U Ne Win have identical views in theirdisregard for dialogue and civil authority,'' Suu Kyi said.   Residents said many people stayed indoors to avoid anticipatedclashes and some shops in the city closed during the afternoon.   But witnesses said the military appeared to be keeping a lowprofile and did not attempt to prevent political leaders fromspeaking.   On Wednesday, more than 10,000 Burmese rallied to hear Suu Kyispeak in what Rangoon-based diplomats said was the largest politicalgathering since last September.</TEXT></DOC>
