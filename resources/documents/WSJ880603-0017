The company, based in Seattle, said it will sell 20 million common shares -- 13% of the total -- in Burlington Resources Inc., the new subsidiary that will hold the parent's timber, real estate, coal and oil and gas properties. The company hopes to make the offering sometime in July. Burlington plans to retain an 87% stake in the new unit and, under certain conditions, spin off the stake to the parent's holders.    If the company is successful in selling the 13% at a cost it estimated at between $25 to $28 a share, Burlington Resources would have a market value of a little more than $4 billion. That would give credence to analysts' estimates that the entire company has a breakup value of about $110 a share, or $8.2 billion. Last week, the entire company had a market value of $4.47 billion.    Separately, Burlington's El Paso Natural Gas Co. unit said it will take a $143 million second-quarter charge to resolve disputes involving certain gas contracts.    Industry analysts applauded both moves. The public offering will enhance assets long undervalued by the market, they said. The company's estimate for the the price of Burlington Resources shares might be a bit low, they said, but certainly within many of their estimates. El Paso Natural's planned second-quarter charge, analysts added, also indicated a willingness by Burlington to place El Paso Natural's assets into the new unit unencumbered of legal disputes.    Burlington's stock surged in composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, closing at $69.125, up $1.75 on heavy volume of about 2.7 million shares.    Some analysts said Burlington's plan was conservative given the options the company could have taken, such as selling off some of its operations. &quot;This is a start. There are always subsequent moves that could be made,&quot; said Craig Schwerdt, an analyst at Morgan, Olmstead, Kennedy andamp; Gardner Inc., Los Angeles. Moreover, they said the new unit is so large that its success or failure in enhancing Burlington's stock value may influence other companies that may be considering similar moves.    The company said it will include in the new subsidiary its El Paso Natural Gas unit, the owner and operator of a 22,000-mile interstate natural gas transmission system that runs from Texas to Southern California; its Meridian Oil Inc. unit, an oil and gas concern with 3.3 billion cubic feet of proven domestic gas equivalent reserves; its Plum Creek Timber Co. Inc. unit, a timber and forest concern with 10.5 billion board feet; Meridian Minerals Co., its coal and minerals unit with 14.5 billion tons of coal; and Glacier Park Co., a real estate development, management and sale concern.    As part of the public offering, Burlington said it requested a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to see if the agency will allow a nontaxable distribution of Burlington Northern's stake in Burlington Resources. Burlington Northern said it may spin off its 87% interest in the unit to Burlington Northern shareholders, but said in addition to the IRS ruling, it will &quot;evaluate market and economic conditions and other factors in assessing the merits&quot; of distributing its stake. It said such a distribution would not occur before mid-December.    The company said that by separating its rail and non-rail assets into two units it will be better able to focus on running its railroad operations, which have been among the top three profitable rail concerns in the country, analysts said.    In disclosing plans to take the $143 million second-quarter charge, El Paso Natural Gas said it filed a proposal with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to resolve certain gas contract disputes involving customers. In the filing made Wednesday, the company proposed to absorb 25% of its obligations, which resulted in the charge. The dispute over contractual agreements stemmed from so-called take-or-buy contracts, in which El Paso was forced to pay for natural gas, even if it couldn't sell it to customers.    The company also proposed in its filings to recoup 75% of its obligations, either through direct billing or through adjusted gas sales and transportation rates in the future.    For the first quarter, Burlington Northern had net of $91.5 million, or $1.22 a share, on revenue of $1.8 billion.    Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it placed the credit ratings of El Paso Natural Gas Co.'s single-A-3 debentures, single-A-3 shelf registration and prime-2 commercial paper under review for possible downgrade because of Burlington's plans to create a new subsidiary. El Paso Natural &quot;has substantial past and present exposure under top contracts with gas producers,&quot; Moody's said.    Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it placed El Paso Natural's single-A-minus senior debt and A-1 commercial paper on Creditwatch with positive implications. About $375 million in debt is affected by the actions of both credit rating concerns. Burlington Northern said it didn't have any comment. </TEXT></DOC>
