Gudac, Jr.andP;  Uniontown, PAandM;You're right.andP;  Works is probably the most underappreciated program for theMac today.andP;  We haven't entirely overlooked it, though--there's an articlecoming soon that shows you how to make Works work even better.andM;Something for NothingandM;Last September an article appeared in Chicago Computing about a device calledthe Converter, which is essentially a precision hole punch designed toproduce the extra hole in a floppy-disk case that allows the Mac to formatand run the disk as a 1.44-megabyte high-density disk.andP;  The writer arguedthat the significant differences between double-density and high-densitydisks lay in two technical specifications, called signal return andcoercivity, and that these factors vary more among manufacturers than betweenthe double-density and high-density disk made by any one manufacturer.andM;This argument sounds reasonable to me, but I don't have the expertise toevaluate it.andP;  What do you make of his claims?andP;  If he's wrong, I guess myConverter goes into the trash.andP;  Donald T. Dryden Chicago, ILandM;Wasn't it P. T. Barnum who said, &quot;There's a high-density disk born everyminute&quot;?andP;  The only thing I'd trust to store on a disk that was modified inthis way is data that I never wanted to see again -- and a magnet works justas well for that.andP;  Sorry, but I recommend the trash.andM;New ResMENUandM;In the May issue of MacUser, I noticed that my program ResMENU was mentionedin an article on editing menus (&quot;Creating Resources and Menus,&quot; page 331).andO;The article referred to an older version of the program, and I'd like to letyour readers know that a new version (fully compatible with ResEdit 1.2) isnow available.andP;  You can get it by sending a blank formatted disk and returnpostage to Alan T. Goates, OtherWare, 2055 Parley's Canyon Blvd., Salt LakeCity, UT 84109.andP;  Alan T. Goates Salt Lake City, UTandM;Revenge of the NerdsandM;I look to your magazine for advice on what is the best in the Mac world, butI would like to comment on &quot;The Mac IIfx: Fast Times at Apple Computer&quot; byRussell Ito and John Rizzo (May '90, page 114).andP;  They stated as a fact, &quot;Onlynerds love UNIX.&quot;andP;  I believe this is their opinion and not a fact.andP;  I havemet many UNIX users and would not call most of them nerds.andP;  If this statementwere made at a UNIX convention, I believe you'd find it to be untrue of manyof the people there.andP;  Sherri K. Harms Hays, KSandM;Sorry, no offense intended.andP;  Some of our best friends are nerds.andM;Off the Critical ListandM;Thank you for publishing &quot;Critical Accounts&quot; by Ken Landis (May '90, page156).andP;  Accounting software is difficult and time-consuming to evaluate.andO;Given the limited time a reviewer has to spend with a program, I fullyappreciate the effort and results of Mr. Landis' hard work.andM;The synopsis for our products MultiLedger, CashLedger, and Payroll, however,noted that we have no transaction journals.andP;  In fact, we have alwayscategorized our transactions into five main journals: Disbursements,Receipts, General, Payables, and Sales.andP;  In addition to being in thejournals, transactions for the entire year are listed in the General Ledgerin account-number sequence.andP;  James M. Mathre, President CheckMark Software,Inc. Ft.andP;  Collins, COandM;Powerful SupportandM;I am writing to commend the support provided by Power Up!andP;  Software.andP;  Afterinstalling its Address Book Plus, I found the program wouldn't print on myRicoh PC Laser 6000/PS.andP;  I called Power Up! support.andP;  During twoconversations, the principal author of the program, Kevin Jones, spent almosttwo hours leading me through the solution to my problem.andP;  It turned out theproblem was in my system software and not in the Power Up! program.andP;  Twohours of telephone support--Power Up! called me -- for a program that costless than $50 is no way to make money.andP;  But it sure builds good will! EdwardAshworth Lafayette, LAandM;Plenum of Nothin'andM;Your &quot;Star Wars&quot; article on networking (May '90, page 186) was very useful,but the author is mistaken regarding plenum wire.andP;  Plenum is not &quot;a specialcoating that doesn't produce poisonous gases when burned.&quot;andP;  The air spaceabove a hung ceiling is a &quot;plenum&quot; when it's used as the return air duct fora heating or air-conditioning system.andP;  Conditioned air flows through ducts inthe ceiling and out into the room, and the &quot;return&quot; air goes back through theplenum (saving the cost of separate return ducts).andM;Fire officials have discovered that the air flow in plenums encourages thespread of fire along anything in the plenum that's flammable, includingnormal PVC wire insulation.andP;  &quot;Plenum cable&quot; is shorthand for &quot;plenum-ratedcable,&quot; and it signifies that the wire has passed a special test for fireresistance, flame spread, and low smoke generation.andP;  The insulation onplenum-rated wire is made of material such as Teflon or Halar, and it usuallycosts two to ten times more than normal cable.andP;  However, the installed costof plenum-rated cable is usually lower than the alternative, which is to putcheap cable into metal conduit wherever it passes through a plenum.andM;The author is correct -- always check building codes before installingcabling.andP;  And check the ceiling too -- you may have a ducted return system,in which case the ceiling is not a plenum and it may be legal to useless-expensive cable.andP;  David Lerner New York, NYandM;Time to wipe the plenum off our faces.andM;Adams' AppleandM;&quot;From the Ground Up&quot; by Douglas Adams (May '90, page 148) was absolutely onthe mark in showing how human your magazine is, just like the Mac.andP;  I loveAdams' books, and it's my dearest hope that he continues writing on anyMacintosh.andP;  Incidentally, the number 42 is approximately 10.5 million yearsold.andP;  Mark J. Sieler Java, SDandM;Windows WatchersandM;&quot;Windows Won't Kill the Mac&quot; (May '90, page 315) by Thom Hogan wasinteresting.andP;  I agree with the premise of the article, but with all itsfaults, Word for Windows is a real help to me.andP;  I have some Macintoshfunctionality on that otherwise-useless mass of silicon and metal on my deskat work.andP;  I am looking forward to getting the capabilities of Word forWindows on my Mac at home, where those abilities will be faster, more stable,and easier to use.andM;Unfortunately, Word for Windows does possibly the worst thing it could do forthe Mac.andP;  It makes IBM users think they can do everything they can do on aMac on a PC.andP;  That makes it even harder to convince someone to switch to theMacintosh.andP;  I'll take a Mac Plus over the highest-end PC any day.andP;  TimCimbura Columbia Heights, MNandM;Mac users are thoroughly spoiled, so perhaps it isn't surprising that ThomHogan's anti-PC bias showed in &quot;Windows Won't Kill the Mac.&quot;andP;  He could haveat least seemed more objective and at the same time have had the comparisoncome out even more in favor of the Mac implementation of Word.andM;I too use Mac Word and Word for Windows.andP;  Unlike Thom, I find WinWord slowerin all regards on my 12-megahertz 286 than Mac Word on the Macintosh II atthe office.andP;  Some of the dialog boxes seem to take an eternity to act andclear, and often the pointer icon is there for seconds before the hourglassappears, letting me know that I am supposed to ist and fidget.andP;  I've readcomments on bulletin-board services that suggest that may experience is thenorm, even with souped-up 386s.andM;Unless Microsoft does the impossible with Windows 3.0, PC devotees will thinkthey have caught up with those lucky guys who could afford Macs but Mac userswill know better and the Mac advantage will be secure for a few more years.andM;Me?andP;  I'll stick to my clone at home until something brings Apple pricing towhere it ought to be.andP;  Colin Taylor Mansfield, TXandM;Bigger Isn't BetterandM;Robert Wiggins put an insulting twist on an excellent piece of advice(&quot;Creative Cost Cutting,&quot; April '90, page 27).andP;  His suggestion to shop bymail order is right on target.andP;  However, his recommendation of &quot;the majors,the ones with the multipages ads&quot; while relegating &quot;the smaller outfits&quot; touse by only &quot;the brave&quot; is both ill-conceived and a slap in the face to yoursmall-space advertisers.andM;MacStore has been in the pages of MacUser since the birth of your magazine.andO;Over the years, we have watched so-called multiple-page majors come and go.andO;Even today, with the burgeoning catalog clones, few match our continuity orattempt to duplicate our services.andM;Quality in a business is instilled by its people, not by the gloss of itsadvertising.andP;  Big does not mean better.andP;  Jim Tucker, Manager of MarketingMacStore New Braunfels, TXandM;Haranguing on the TelephoneandM;This is a warning to readers who may have succumbed to Apple's Christmasadvertising of rebates and extended credit.andP;  Apple Credit has apparently soldits account list to a bunch of telemarketers.andP;  At least, I got a call from anoutfit selling &quot;auto advantage&quot; (a discount auto-service plan) that claimedto be calling because of my account with Apple Credit.andM;I expected to get onto some more mailing lists when I bought a Mac but notonto a phone list.andP;  I object strenuously to telemarketers.andP;  I have a phonefor my convenience, not theirs.andM;I would like to ask any readers of MacUser who have been getting such callsto protest to both Apple and Apple Credit.andP;  Maybe if we get together, we canput a stop to this invasion of privacy.andP;  David Doan San Diego, CAandM;CD-ROM RatingsandM;We are responding to the CD-ROM article in the March '90 MacUser (&quot;MostValuable Players,&quot; page 150).andP;  Here at EDUCORP, a pioneer in the CD-ROMindustry, we use the Apple, Denon, and Toshiba CD-ROM drives.andM;A two-and-a-half-mouse rating for the Denon DRB-253 CD-ROM drive is a greatinjustice.andP;  The Denon's access time is about the same as that of the Appledrive.andP;  Another SCSI port can be installed for about the same price as aterminator, although most users find internal termination to be moreconvenient.andM;The size of the Denon drive allows you to put your Mac or your Mac II monitoron top of the drive so you can free up desk space.andP;  Denon also has a sleepmode that shuts the laser down when the drive is not being used.andP;  Thisfeature helps protect the drive from wear and tear.andM;The power button on the Denon is located conveniently on the front of thedrive, so users do not have to reach around to the back to turn the poweroff.andP;  Finally, Denon offers a toll-free technical-support line.andP;  Suzi Nawabi,Manager EDUCORP Solana Beach, CAandM;Sampling AdviceandM;&quot;Sound Advice&quot; (May '90, page 284) stated that &quot;down-sampling is when youtake a sample recorded at one frequency and use SoundEdit's Mixer option toconvert it to a lower frequency.&quot;andP;  This is true, but you didn't mention thatthe same effect can be accomplished with copying and pasting, a much fasterand more natural method.andM;You also left out that you can &quot;up-sample&quot; by using either method, althoughin normal circumstances you wouldn't want to.andP;  An up-sampled sound requiresmore disk space, without a corresponding increase in sound quality.andO;Nevertheless, in some cases it might be useful.andP;  For instance, if you wantedto use a sound sampled at 11K in Crystal Quest, you would have to up-sampleit to 22K to make it play at the right pitch.andP;  Jason Townsend San Antonio, TXandM;Abstract AdditionandM;Thank you for publsihing the short review of MacInfo in Bobker's Dozen (June'90, page 44).andP;  We would like to make one important correction: MacInfo doesinclude a short abstract for every article it indexes.andP;  In fact, the currentversion of MacInfor has 4,460 abstracts from MacUser, MacWeek, and other Macpublications.andP;  Emanuel Rosen Niles and Associates, Inc. Berkeley, CAandM;Running BoardsandM;Who needs accelerator boards?andP;  Mac Plus owners, that's who.andP;  Please run someof the boards through your MacUser Labs.andP;  Ricardo Gonzalez Mayaguez, PuertoRicoandM;We're ahead of you on this one.andP;  Check out &quot;Chasing the IIfx: Accelerators&quot;this month to find out whether the accelerator option can compete withApple's current upgrade programs.andM;Secret KeysandM;Almost every month, an article or a letter discusses &quot;keyboard secrets&quot; --obscure but helpful Finder commands, most of which are nowhere to be found inthe instructions that come wih a Mac.andP;  Although I appreciate the hints, itangers me that it's necessary to learn them in this way.andM;Why must Apple keep such things secret?andP;  Doesn't the purchaser of the producthave the right to this information in the manuals?andP;  Is here anywhere userscan get all this information in one place, preferably without having to pay(again) for it? Gordon Paine Fullerton, CAandM;The Grass Is Bluer .andP;  .  .andM;Although I'm adyed-blue-in-the-wool IBM microcomputer user, I am alsofortunate enough to have access to Macs and MacUser magazine.andP;  Allow me tocheer the Mac.andP;  I like it.andP;  However, Mac fanatics are nuts for putting upwith the extortionist prices charged by Mac suppliers.andP;  Prices for20-megabyte hard-disk drives were quoted as ranging froma  &quot;low&quot; of $399 to ahigh of $899!andM;Even under the assumption that I would tolerate a minuscule, creeping,20-megabyte hard-disk drive, I would not expect to pay more than $250 for thesame capacity and performance in the IBM marketplace.andP;  Sincerely, and hurtingfor you .andP;  .  .  Mark Wheeler New York, NYandM;.  .  .  on the Other SideandM;I'm a PC hacker who's been stuck with a Mac at work.andP;  Actually, I don't mindtoo much.andP;  If Marc folk weren't to haughty (bordering on arrogant), it wouldbe quite a pleasant platform to work on!andP;  (Actually, I like the longfilenames better than the bit-mapped interface or anything else!)andP;  Naturally,I'm turning to MacUser for info -- I love the C programming column.andP;  It'sreminiscent of my huge collection of PC Magazines.andM;Only one question: Does Paul Somerson remember his PC roots at all?andP;  He seemsto embody a sort of aggressive elitism reminiscent of badly recycled AynRand! John Faughnan (72300,3466) Via ZmacandM;When asked to reply, Paul shrugged.andM;Au CurrentandM;Being a Swedish reader of MacUser, I have so far missed an important detailevery time I read a review about some types of hardware: Does it work withour European electricity -- 220 volts/50 hertz?andP;  But now it is here!andP;  In theMarch issue, you have added this vital info to your test of CD-ROM drives(&quot;Most Valuable Players,&quot; page 172).andP;  I am sure all your non-American readersappreciate this.andP;  Kjell Olsson Hoting, SwedenandM;The Drivel Made Me Do ItandM;John C. Dvorak has done it again: put his big fat foot in his big fat mouth.andO;His innovation analysis of Apple Computer (&quot;Linear Thinking,&quot; June '90, page350) is nothing more than his usual drivel.andP;  Talk about no innovation atApple--he should analyze himself.andP;  And as far as the Apple IIGS' being a&quot;yawner if there ever was one,&quot; that's ridiculous when you consider thevideo-overlay capability developed for it, among other enhancements.andP;  DaveShively Sunnyvale, CA</TEXT></DOC>
