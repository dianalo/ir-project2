Cornell University computer experts said a weekend oftroubleshooting left them with little evidence to conclude thatRobert T. Morris Jr. was the source of the rogue program, despiteone official's comment that an early version of the program wasfound in Morris' files.   Morris, 23, isn't saying anything publicly, other than a fleetingremark to a television station that all the attention has become ``abit terrifying.''   The ``virus,'' so named because it multiplies after invading acomputer, jammed computers across the country linked to thePentagon-supported Arpanet network, slowing computers by reproducingitself over and over.   Those computer centers affected by the virus say it only took upmemory space and did not destroy any files.   A federal government source familiar with the case who spoke oncondition of anonymity, said Justice Department officials haddecided to step up the FBI's involvement in the case from apreliminary inquiry to a full-scale criminal investigation of Morrisand the events surrounding the virus.   The Washington Post, in its Tuesday editions, quoted lawenforcement sources as saying that the inquiry had been expanded toa full field investigation by the FBI's Washington field office.   The paper said that meant FBI officials had consulted withfederal prosecutors and agreed that the FBI had jurisdiction andthat there was reason to believe there may have been a violation offederal criminal law.   FBI spokesman Charles Steinmetz declined to give details on thecase's progress, but said FBI officials probably had talked with theU.S. attorney's office over the weekend.   In a full-scale investigation, the government has the power tosubpoena records and documents and compel testimony through theauthorization of immunity, two techniques which are not permittedthrough preliminary inquiries. The move indicated the FBI was movingvery quickly in the case because in many instances, preliminaryinquiries take a month or more.   Justice sources said the FBI was trying on Monday to get aninterview with Morris and apparently had not done so by the end ofthe day.   Another government source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said investigators were not sure whether any criminal activityactually occurred, as defined by a statute passed in 1984.   A section of that law says it is unlawful to enter a governmentcomputer with the intent to disrupt its functions. The crime ispunishable by up to 10 years in prison.   The source said that in this case, there's no evidence thatanything was taken from the computers, but rather that it was aquestion of disrupting computer systems.   One section of law addresses sabotage, but the source said it wasunclear whether the virus case would involve an intent to disruptthe computer.   The source said he believed the bureau was investigating thematter in view of the fact that there were breaches of security, andthat the Justice Department will have to determine whether thematter involved criminal conduct.   ``There's a lot of ambiguity'' in the matter, the source said.   Thomas Guidoboni, a lawyer for the Washington, D.C., firm ofBonner andamp; O'Connell, said he had been retained to represent Morris``in the so-called computer virus matter.''   ``We have notified the federal authorities of our representationand his whereabouts,'' the lawyer said. ``We are in the process ofinvestigating the facts and circumstances which have been reportedby the press in order to determine our course of action.''   Morris' father, Robert T. Morris Sr., chief scientist at theNational Computer Security Center in Bethesda, Md., has refused tosay if his son created the virus. He said his son left the Ithaca,N.Y., campus last week to avoid reporters and is staying at thefamily's Arnold, Md., home.   A team of technicians at Cornell spent the weekend searching thecomputer tapes and accounts trying to track the source.   Morris' friends have said he created the virus as an intellectualchallenge and that it was supposed to lie dormant in computersystems, according to several news accounts of the incursion.   Morris reportedly went to dinner after setting the program looseWednesday night and checked it before going to bed. Discovering hismistake, Morris desperately worked to find a way to stop the virus'spread.   He called Harvard's Aiken Computation Lab early Thursday afterrealizing there was an error in the program he had intended to beharmless, said ndrew H. Sudduth, a programmer at the lab. Morris didhis undergraduate studies at Harvard.   ``He was extremely shocked and tired,'' Sudduth told The HarvardCrimson in a story published Monday. ``His tone was very sober.''   Computer security consultants said they had received far moreinquiries than usual since last week. However, they said computersecurity troubles cannot be solved with passwords and installinganti-viral software.   Jon David, a computer security consultant in Tappan, N.Y., saidbusinesses that had contacted him for help seemed to underestimatethe challenge.   ``The amazing thing is, the attitude I'm getting is, `Why don'tyou stop by for a day or two and tell us how to protect ourselvesfrom viruses?''' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
