The Defense Budget Project estimated that spending fordevelopment of such strategic weapons as the rail-garrison MXnuclear missile, the Midgetman and the B-2 stealth bomber willincrease about 29 percent, in addition to increases to keep up withinflation, through fiscal year 1996.   Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has proposed zerogrowth in the overall defense budget, including cuts of $10 billionin fiscal 1990 to meet the compromise agreement reached by theWhite House and Congress. Proposed growth in later years wouldmatch inflation.   ``Given budgetary constraints on defense, strategic forces mustcompete with conventional forces for scarce funds,'' the reportsaid. ``If the defense budget as a whole is cut or grows onlyenough to keep pace with inflation, the projected growth in fundingfor strategic forces would come at the expense of funding forconventional forces.''   Dr. Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, calledthe possible results ``internal budgeting cannibalism,'' and saidconventional forces and military readiness would pay the price.   ``It would mirror what we did in the 1980s,'' Adams said in atelephone interview.   The Defense Budget Project is a non-profit research organizationthat takes a critical look at Pentagon spending. The organizationwas founded in 1983.   In its 66-page report, ``Strategic Forces Funding in the 1990s:A Renewed Buildup?'', the group said money for strategic forces canbe controlled by either eliminating weapons programs or slowingproduction.   The report recommends that the Bush administration and Congressrevise strategic modernization plans. The administration iscurrently conducting a strategy review with a final report expectedlater this month.   Specifically, the report said a reduced reliance onintercontinental ballistic missiles is the cheaper option whilemobility of the ICBMs is the most expensive.   Cheney has proposed moving the 50 multiple-warhead, MX nuclearmissiles from their silos to railroad cars while spending $100million on development of the single-warhead, Midgetman missile.   The report also said that bombers are the most costly aspect ofstrategic forces, and a decision must be made on whether to producethe B-2 after acquiring the B-1B.   Under the current budget proposal, production of the B-2 will bepushed back a year to 1993 with almost $4.1 billion cut from thefiscal 1990 and 1991 budgets for the radar-evading plane.   The report also said that funding demands for Star Wars can bereduced by stressing long-term research rather than near-termdeployment. Cheney has proposed reducing funding for Star Wars by$1 billion, and shifting the focus from deployment sometime in the1990s to research on ``Brilliant Pebbles,'' a more advanced systemconsisting of thousands of orbiting satellites.   In addition, the report said that submarine-launched ballisticmissiles are the most cost-effective for delivering nuclearwarheads.   It said a possible arms-reduction treaty, ``if successfullynegotiated, will provide an opportunity to reconsider strategicpolicies and programs, but it will not, in itself, save largeamounts of money.''   The report said such a treaty would allow current modernizationto continue ``with only minor reductions in the number ofsubmarines and missiles procured.''</TEXT></DOC>
