John Poindexter testified that the National Security Council staff became &quot;the driving force&quot; behind freeing U.S. hostages in the Mideast as the State and Defense departments failed to recommend any initiatives &quot;to accomplish the objective.&quot;    &quot;Very frankly, I don't recall a single recommendation from those two departments,&quot; said the former national security adviser, who implicity criticized Secretary of State George Shultz for withdrawing last year from the White House's secret Iran initiative.    &quot;The sad fact is that the secretary of state chose to protect his own position, did he not?&quot; asked Rep. Michael DeWine (R., Ohio).    &quot;You could draw that conclusion,&quot; answered the naval officer.    In his fifth and final day before House and Senate committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair, Adm. Poindexter's testimony set the stage for the questioning of Secretary Shultz tomorrow and the appearances next week of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Attorney General Edwin Meese.    More than ever, the former NSC adviser painted a personal portrait of divisions within the administration and the frustrations that brought the NSC staff into secret operations with the late director of the Central Intelligence Agency, William Casey.    In a revealing exchange, Adm. Poindexter read aloud portions of a previously classified transcript of a telephone conversation last November with Mr. Casey as the administration sought to grapple with the brewing scandal.    &quot;I'd like to spend some time, just the two of us,&quot; the naval officer told Mr. Casey as the two men pointedly excluded the State and Defense departments. &quot;Ed Meese indicated . . . he should want to be helpful and so he would like to be in at least one of the meetings.&quot;    The same mood of secrecy and distrust showed itself repeatedly in the admiral's remarks, as he accused Congress of &quot;bad faith&quot; in frustrating President Reagan's foreign policy and charged news organizations with &quot;deliberate distortions.&quot;    &quot;I leave these hearings with my head held high,&quot; Adm. Poindexter said. But from committee members of both parties, he heard criticism that his obsession with secrecy had damaged the president he sought to serve.    &quot;You locked the president himself out of the policy,&quot; said House committee Chairman Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.), sounding a theme set by Rep. DeWine only hours before. &quot;You came in here and said the buck stops with me,&quot; the young Ohio conservative had said. &quot;But the sad truth is that in this country, the buck can only stop one place, that's in the Oval Office.&quot;    To the end, Adm. Poindexter carried himself with the assurance of a man who was the highest-ranking military officer in the White House through his 5 1/2 years at the NSC. Proud of his relationship with Mr. Casey, he rejected any suggestion that he may have been used by the late director and portrayed him, along with Mr. Meese, as an ally within the administration.    The attorney general faces extensive questioning next week regarding his preliminary inquiry last November into the affair. Investigators are focusing on meetings and exchanges between the three men before Adm. Poindexter's resignation Nov. 25. On Nov. 22, four days after their transcribed telephone conversation, Mr. Casey and the admiral had lunch together. The former adviser also indicated that Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, a central figure in the Iran-Contra operation, joined in portions of the discussion.    The lunch came a day after Mr. Meese had begun his inquiry, even as the attorney general was learning of a document found that morning in Col. North's files outlining the diversion of arms-sale profits to Nicaraguan insurgents. Adm. Poindexter said that he and Mr. Casey didn't discuss the diversion during the lunch, but prior testimony by Col. North and papers released by the committees indicate the director was aware of the operation and concerned that it was in jeopardy.    Col. North has testified that as early as mid-October, Mr. Casey had directed him to begin to destroy relevant records. It remains unclear if Adm. Poindexter fully understood the events moving around him. He testified that he had never told Mr. Casey of the diversion, and as the scandal was unraveling, he was unaware that the director had known about it for months and even discussed, according to Col. North, the need for Adm. Poindexter to resign to protect the administration.    Mr. Meese met the night of Nov. 22 with Mr. Casey at the late director's home. Despite his discovery of the diversion memo hours before, he has previously denied having any discussions then about the secret transfer of funds to the Contras.    On Nov. 24, the attorney general and Adm. Poindexter discussed the potential need for the security adviser to resign from his White House post. While expressing no bitterness, Adm. Poindexter testified he was &quot;surprised&quot; by the suddenness of the final decision to ask him to step down the next morning.    An intense but distant figure at the witness table, Adm. Poindexter sparred throughout his testimony on the meaning of words he used. His approach was at times very broad -- saying there was only a &quot;semantic&quot; difference between military and non-lethal &quot;humanitarian&quot; aid for the Contras -- and at times very narrow -- arguing a distinction between &quot;covert actions&quot; and clandestine &quot;special activities.&quot;    In a telling exchange, Adm. Poindexter acknowledged that even Col. North had difficulty &quot;drawing the fine line that the president was drawing&quot; in defending the early Iran initiative and the plan to sell weapons to a nation that supported terrorists. And he denied that retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, who oversaw the network of private corporations in the Iran-Contra operation, was an agent of the government, but said instead he was working in &quot;cooperation&quot; with the administration.    The former national security adviser and his aides also rejected the bureaucracy's analysis of foreign-policy problems when they disagreed with it. Adm. Poindexter testified that he, along with Mr. Casey, Col. North and a few other NSC staff members, embraced a doomsday analysis of events in Iran put forward by the Israelis but rejected by most officials at the State and Defense departments and at the CIA.    Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) noted that in January 1986, when Adm. Poindexter briefed President Reagan from a memo warning that &quot;the Israelis are very concerned about Iran's deteriorating position in the war with Iraq,&quot; the U.S. intelligence community was preparing a paper that said America's greatest worry was an Iranian victory. The CIA published the new U.S. analysis, called a &quot;Special National Intelligence Estimate,&quot; in February 1986, just as the administration was beginning the first direct sales of arms to Iran.    Questioned by Sen. Nunn, the admiral said members of the NSC staff and CIA Director Casey -- who approved the special intelligence estimate -- disagreed with its conclusions and agreed with the Israeli position.    When Mr. Meese testifies next week, he's expected to answer questions regarding Justice Department activities last year. As early as March 1986, some senior Justice Department officials apparently were concerned that a criminal investigation of alleged gun-smuggling to the Contras threatened to upset the White House and possibly reveal covert NSC activities. Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh is investigating whether the attorney general or any of his aides attempted to improperly influence the inquiry, and also has been looking into Mr. Meese's handling of the preliminary investigation last November in the Iran-Contra affair.    According to a memo referred to by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter Rodino (D., N.J.), then-Deputy Attorney General D. Lowell Jensen told associates he was &quot;giving a heads-up to the NSC&quot; on the status of the gun-smuggling investigation. By that time, according to congressional and criminal investigators, Justice Department officials had come across some leads suggesting possible White House involvement in efforts to resupply the Contras.    Mr. Meese has denied interfering with the gun-smuggling investigation. Mr. Jensen, now a federal district court judge in San Francisco, has declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
