Regardless of season, soil disturbance was significantlygreater after ground skidding than after cable yarding, average 40-45%and 22-30%, respectively. Differences between seasons were small andnot significant. Skid roads were the main source of soil disturbancein both seasons on ground-skidded areas. The main source of disturbanceon cable-yarded areas was yarding in the summer and haul roads in thewinter. Skidding also caused more deep to very deep disturbance thancable yarding. For both logging methods, deep and very deep disturbanceaccounted for 75-80% of total disturbance. Extent of soil disturbanceand slope steepness were not significantly related. The high variabilityin soil disturbance noted in this study was similar to that in othersurveys. It is concluded that operational factors must be consideredin future research. (Refs. 28).</TEXT></DOC>
