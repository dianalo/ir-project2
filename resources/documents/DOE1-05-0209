<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-05-0209 </DOCNO><TEXT>A substantial geothermal study was started in 1965 as a joint UNDP - MTAprogram, wherein the first examination well was drilled in 1968 with540 m depth and a geothermal reservoir (198 `C) was recorded at 436 mdepth. The kijildere power plant is designed for the output of 20,400KW and 2,600 KW of which is consumed by a gas ejector connected to theturbine, leaving 17,800 KW as an effective output. The plant had longbeen closed due to the shortage of steam because of the scale adhesionon the pipe walls, but was reopened in Jan, 1986 at the level of 6,000KW output for the time being. Removal of CaCO{sub 3} scale is physicallymade; the well requires the scale removing once per average six monthfor the well and once per month for the pipes on the ground surface.Eight additional wells are regarded necessary to keep the power supplycontinuous. Present 6 wells produce 1,600 t/h geothermal fluid; gas-waterratio is 1:9; the temperature of hot water is 200 - 210 `C at the wellbottom and 140 `C at the separator inlet.
