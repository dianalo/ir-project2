But the tax overhaul he produced, which the upper house of parliament is expected to approve today, amounts to little more than tinkering: a lowering of the top marginal tax rate for individuals to 53% from 56%. For business there is almost no relief: The tax on retained earnings remains about 70%, the world's highest. And to boost revenues, new consumer taxes are being imposed.    In the process, the Bonn government has angered broad segments of the public. Its tax package also isn't likely to satisfy the Reagan administration, which has been urging the Kohl government to make stimulative tax cuts.    The European Community is upset because a new tax on natural gas goes against its hopes for greater tax harmonization. The German banking community is unhappy because a new tax on interest income further buries Frankfurt's chances of becoming a major financial center. The driving public is outraged because it will be paying substantially higher gasoline taxes while the fuel used by a relatively small group of amateur pilots is exempt.    The full impact of the tax changes probably won't come until 1990, when many taxpayers will discover that the net effect is reduced spendable income.    The tax package remains the most comprehensive in West Germany's 40-year history. It will cut a total 19 billion marks ($10.43 billion) annually from individual tax bills starting in 1990. But the impact of the cuts has been gutted by compromises and special-interest pressures exerted within the three-party ruling coalition. The result: new taxes, and increases in existing levies, meant to raise 12 billion marks annually starting next year, one year before the income-tax cuts take effect.    Reagan-style tax cuts were never in the cards. But the Free Democratic Party had wanted at the very least to lower the top marginal tax rate for individuals below 50%. Mr. Kohl did too. Their plans were immediately attacked by the so-called social wing of the ruling Christian Democratic Union, which wanted more tax revenue to go to the poor.    Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, like Mr. Reagan in the U.S., has instituted major tax cuts. But whereas Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party holds power by itself, Mr. Kohl heads a three-party ruling coalition. And in Germany's federalist system, state governors can behave like feudal lords.    Still, tax-cut advocates say the chancellor must share the blame for the muddled tax program. Except for one table-pounding incident, Mr. Kohl never threw his weight behind the tax-cut plan.    The best example of that came just a few days ago, when the flap erupted over the proposed gas-tax exemption for private pilots. The tax break, championed by Bavarian Gov. Franz Josef Strauss, almost led to defeat of the overall tax plan in the lower house. Mr. Kohl finally admitted that the exemption &quot;wasn't a good thing,&quot; but sidestepped the issue by saying it was Bavaria's responsibility, not Bonn's, to find a solution.    The tax overhaul was further diluted when the task of shepherding it fell to Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg. Not only has his clout been diminished by a recent scandal involving one of his proteges, but he has never been a strong proponent of tax cuts. His top priority is lowering the budget deficit.    Indeed, the whole notion of cutting taxes is suspect to many German politicians. Tax cuts, conventional thinking goes, lead to less government revenue, higher interest rates and inflation, the latter an overriding concern of Germans.    Stuttgart Mayor Manfred Rommel, a Christian Democrat, thinks the government's approach to taxation is so incoherent that the tax package should be rejected today on that basis alone. That is quite unlikely, but the chaos surrounding the tax debate may have an increasing number of people thinking that he has a point. </TEXT></DOC>
