As part of the buyout, the furniture-rental company said Walker M. Treece will resign as chief executive officer. Mr. Treece said that whether he will remain as chairman has &quot;not yet been discussed.&quot; But he said he will at least remain an employee with duties in the planning and development areas.    Spectrum, a Los Angeles-based, closely held merchant bank specializing in leveraged buyouts, said other managers would also stay on.    GranTree common stock jumped $1.625 a share to $9.75 in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.    G Acquisition Corp., which Spectrum established to make the leveraged buyout, plans to begin a tender offer for GranTree common shares; shares that aren't tendered will be acquired afterwards in a cash merger.    Spectrum said Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is financing the transaction. It said GranTree management will hold a stake in the company after the buyout, but declined to be more specific.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    GranTree earned $497,000, or 16 cents a share, in the second quarter ended April 30, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $53,000. Revenue fell about 9% to $19.5 million. </TEXT></DOC>
