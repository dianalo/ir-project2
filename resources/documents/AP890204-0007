Andres Rodriguez was sworn in aspresident Friday after ousting President Alfredo Stroessner in acoup that reportedly left scores dead. Rodriguez ordered thedictator out of the country he had ruled for 34 years.   Rodriguez, who had been Stroessner's second-in-command in thearmy and whose daughter is married to Stroessner's son, took theoath of office and swore in a nine-member Cabinet comprised of sevencivilians, an active general and a retired general.   Paraguayans poured into the streets to celebrate the militarycoup and to gape at damage left by hours of heavy fighting betweenrebel soldiers and police and troops loyal to Stroessner.   ``My government will respect the human rights of everyone to makedemocracy a reality,'' Rodriguez, five rows of medals on hisshirtfront, said during a short speech at the 19th century NationalPalace overlooking the broad Paraguay River.   Cox newspapers, quoting from a classified State Departmentreport, said Friday that Rodriquez is considered by law enforcementauthorities in Paraguay to be the country's No. 1 drug trafficker.   The New York Times on Saturday quoted John Hoyt Williams, aprofessor of Latin American history at Indiana State University inTerre Haute, Ind., as saying, ``Rodriguez has reportedly providedprotection, airfields and an air taxi service to people smugglingdrugs northward.''   At least 18 soldiers and a handful of civilians were killedduring fierce clashes between troops loyal to Stroessner andRodriguez, the Roman Catholic Church-run Radio Caritas said, sayingthat the total could top 200.   It gave no source or explanation for the wide fluctuation.Officials at the main military and police hospitals refused to givefigures on casualties, and the new government made no estimate.   But a police sergeant said on condition of anonymity: ``I'm sadfor my 35 dead companions. About 150 soldiers died at thepresidential escort batallion, and two civilians.''   Stroessner, 76, was put under house arrest at an army base, about30 of his followers and aides detained, and the hierarchy of thegovernment and ruling Colorado Party replaced.   Stroessner was ordered out of the country, and unconfirmedreports said he was going to Santiago, Chile. But Gen. MarioMardones, Santiago police commander, said: ``He is definitely notcoming here tonight. He is still in Paraguay. That's official.''   Mardones said he believed Stroessner was leaving ParaguaySaturday morning, ``but we do not know where to. Not necessarilyChile.''   Rodriguez was cheered by several thousand citizens as he took theoath of office and swore in a Cabinet. About 15,000 accompanied himto the Colorado Party headquarters and cheered again when heappointed Juan Ramon Chaves, 87, as party president, replacingpro-Stroessner militant Sabino Montonaro.   ``We're going to have a true democracy!'' shouted Domingo Laino,president of the National Accord group of four opposition partiesand Paraguay's best-known human rights advocate.   ``I think that the era of terrorism and corruption that affectedour country for so long has come to an end, thanks to the armedforces,'' said Aldo Zuccolillo, publisher of ABC Color, thecountry's biggest newspaper at the time Stroessner closed it down in1984 for printing news the government didn't like.   Rodriguez, however, said nothing about elections nor how long hisprovisional presidency would last. He spoke at his swearing-inceremony and in a nationwide address hours earlier in which hedeclared he was ``taking command of the country from this moment.''   Rodriguez, 64, commands the First Army Corps, the premier unit ofthe mostly-conscript, 12,500-man army. Diplomats and politicalobservers said his coup was provoked by Stroessner's attempt toforce him to retire, his personal dislike for Montonaro and thegrowing influence of the military pro-Stroessner wing of theColorado Party.   Rodriguez took advantage of what observers said was widespreadmilitary resentment at the forced, and allegedly politicallymotivated, retirements of about 130 army colonels and navy captainslast month.   At about 9:45 p.m. Thursday night, shooting broke out at thecorps' base in Loma Pyta, four miles north of the capiital. Soonafter, 40 to 50 tanks rumbled out of the base heading downtowntoward the headquarters of the police and Stroessner's presidentialguard.   ``They didn't even ask us to surrender,'' said a member of thepresidential guard, located next to the U.S. Embassy in afashionable neighborhood of streets lined by fine homes and oldmango trees. ``They just opened fire and battered down the gateswith small tanks.''   Army units around the country rallied to Rodriguez' side, and thelack of support for Stroessner was broadcast throughout the capitalby Radio Primero de Marzo, which the rebels took over.   The two TV stations in the capital abruptly went off the airafter the shooting started, as did all radio stations except RadioCaritas and Radio Primero de Marzo.   As light dawned and Paraguayans ventured from their homes, theysaw the main building at the presidential guard roofless and withgaping holes in its brick walls. The modern National Telephonebuilding behind the police station was a mess of twisted metal andshattered glass.   Pools of blood that dried quickly into large red stains werebeside bullet-riddled cars. In front of the presidential guard,scene of some of the heaviest fighting, were the bodies of a dozensoldiers who died defending Stroessner.   The coup was as successful as it was sudden and unexpected. Byafternoon, Rodriguez was in complete control. There were no apparentpockets of resistence to his authority, no condemnations by foreigngovernments.   Stroessner had been a staunch U.S. ally, but in 1986 the Reaganadministration labeled his government a dictatorship. He has beenreported in poor health since prostate surgery five months ago.</TEXT></DOC>
