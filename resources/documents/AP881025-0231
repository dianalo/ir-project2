MARTINEZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Worries about a continuing oversupply of oilfollowing another failed OPEC meeting could further erode pricesthis week, analysts say.   The December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkU.S. crude, tumbled $1.20 a barrel on Monday, finishing the day at$13.17 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   On Friday, the near-term contract had finished at $14.37 perbarrel, off 7 cents for the week.   The sharp drop in crude oil dragged down the prices of refinedproducts as well. The November contract for unleaded gasolinedropped 1.26 cents to finish at 49.96 cents a gallon, with othercontract months down as much as 2 cents a gallon. The heating oilcontract for November closed down 2.81 cents, to a settlement priceof 39.90 cents a gallon, with other contract months also downsharply.   Analysts said the crude price erosion reflected investor worriesthat OPEC would continue flooding world markets with oil, pushingprices down even further.   Since April, prices have fallen more than 25 percent due to thegrowing oversupply of oil.   Prices for the December crude contract opened almost 90 centslower than Friday's close after ministers from eight Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries adjourned a weekend meetingwithout reaching common ground on production quotas.   Oil brokers said investors had hoped this weekend's OPEC meetingin Madrid would produce a new production accord that would reducedaily output by as much as 3 million barrels. Prices had firmedslightly last week in anticipation of a positive outcome.   ``Expectations were so high that in fact an agreement would takeplace, that when it didn't take place the market sold off,'' saidNauman Barakat, vice president for energy investments withPrudential Bache Securities Inc.   The 13-nation cartel produces an estimated 22 million barrels ofoil a day, exceeding its self-imposed ceiling by more than 3million barrels. Observers said before the meeting that theministers planned to set a daily ceiling of 17.4 million barrels.   Iraq is said to be the principal problem, refusing to abide byits 1.6 million barrel-a-day quota since 1986. Iraq is producingapproximately 2.7 million barrels a day, arguing that it needs theoil revenue to rebuild its shattered economy after its eight-yearwar with Iran. The two countries began a cease-fire in August.   Analysts say other quota violators fear that if they roll backtheir own production, Iraq will take over their market share.   Recently, Saudi Arabia, the largest OPEC producer and theworld's largest exporter, began exceeding its 4.3 million-barrelquota, reportedly to punish the other quota violators.   But analysts say OPEC's failure to reach any kind of aresolution this weekend suggested the cartel is far fromreinstituting discipline among its members.   ``The fact that the meeting ended without a firm resolutionconfirmed the existing fundamentals _ that there is too much oil onworld markets and prices have to go lower,'' said James Steel, ananalyst with Refco Inc.   OPEC ministers plan two more meetings in November, including afull ministerial gathering on Nov. 21 in Vienna.</TEXT></DOC>
