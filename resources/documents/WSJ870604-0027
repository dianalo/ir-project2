The gain followed a 1.3% decrease in April, which was the first decline in five months.    Despite the May increase, association officials said sales were restrained by falling demand for cars. Sales of medium-sized cars fell 10%, while those of small units declined 2%. The officials noted that consumers were waiting for the introduction of new models later this year. </TEXT></DOC>
