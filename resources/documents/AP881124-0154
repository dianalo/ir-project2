Relations between the neighboring Soviet bloc allies have beenstrained by Hungary's allegations about discrimination against 1.7million ethnic Hungarians living in Romania.   A formal protest of the expulsion Saturday of Karoly Gyorfi, aHungarian commercial counselor, was given to the Romanian Embassy inBudapest, the official Hungarian news agency MTI reported.   The note said that ``as a response,'' Pavel Platona, a Romanianpolitical counselor erroneously described by MTI as Gyorfi'scounterpart, was declared persona non grata and given 72 hours toleave the country.   Andras Gulyas, head of the Foreign Ministry press department,spoke of a warranted Hungarian reaction to a ``serious provocativeact'' by Romania, which he said was unparalleled in relationsbetween Warsaw Pact nations.   Last Friday, the Foreign Ministry released a statement sayingGyorfi was detained for six hours by Romanian police and accused ofdistributing inciting leaflets.   Hungary ignored a Romanian request to recall Gyorfi and said theRomanian accusations were ``completely unfounded.''   Last summer, Romania closed the Hungarian consulate atCluj-Napoca in Transylvania and expelled its staff after ademonstration in Budapest by up to 50,000 people protesting Romanianpolicies.</TEXT></DOC>
