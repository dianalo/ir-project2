The indictment, announced Tuesday by U.S. Attorney RobertBonner, charged that the chief defendant, Janet Faye McKinzie, 39,engineered a scheme that diverted more than $16 million from NorthAmerican Savings and Loan of Santa Ana.   The alleged fraud cost taxpayers $120 million, which Bonner saidthe Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. spent to cover insureddeposits.   The government alleged that Ms. McKinzie, along with her boss,the late Duayne D. Christensen, devised the massive fraud, whichinvolved creating phony escrow accounts as well as false billingsfor construction expenses.   Others charged in the indictment were members of constructionfirms who cooperated in the scheme, as well as officers of relatedcorporations and a man from Arkansas who allegedly participated inthe phony escrow scheme.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Nancy Wieben Stock, who is prosecutingthe case, said Christensen was a former dentist who had no priorexperience in finance when he launched North America Savings andLoan in 1983.   The thrift was in trouble almost from the outset, she said. Itbecame the subject of a federal investigation in early 1987.   On Jan. 16, 1987, the day that federal regulators were due toarrive and examine the Sandamp;L's books, Christensen, 57, died in atraffic accident. His Jaguar plowed into a stone wall on a freewaynear Newport Beach, Ms. Stock said.   Bonner noted that a $10 million life insurance policy had beentaken out on Christensen, with McKinzie named as the beneficiary.   Ms. Stock said that a lengthy investigation by the insurer foundno evidence of suicide, and the $10 million was paid into anaccount established to cover some federal losses if Ms. McKinzie isconvicted.   Others charged in the indictment were: Victoria R. Walker, 46,of Elk Grove, Calif.; David L. Morgan, 52, of Little Rock, Ark.;Frederick Youngdahl, 53, of Newport Beach; Armando J. Vasquez, 52,of Irvine and Thomas C. Clarke, 63, of Vista.</TEXT></DOC>
