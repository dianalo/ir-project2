The Romeo plantis located in Macomb County, Michigan, which is in an urban ozone nonattainmentarea. Summary of Ford-Romeo Tractor and Equipment SIP Revision The Ford Motor Company's Romeo Tractor and Equipment Plant assembles andfinishes a wide variety of heavy equipment for agricultural, constructionand industrial applications. The plant includes six paint operations whichare subject to the Michigan Air Pollution Control Commission (MAPCC) Rule336.1621. These operations are: A small parts paint system, a flat decktractor chassis system, a straddle mount tractor chassis system, and atouch-up and repair facility for agricultural and industrial tractor modificationsand repairs. A system for painting hydraulic cylinder subassemblies anda modification building paint repair booth are exempted from the requirementsof R336.1621 because the annual emissions from these sources are under10 tons. Primers and top coatings are applied by a ``wet-on-wet'' basisthrough conventional air atomized spray. The company uses approximately160 topcoat colors, most of these consisting of specialty colors with annualusage volumes below 15 gallons. Current plant production is approximately70 agicultural and 20 industrial tractors per day on two shifts per day,5 days per week, 50 weeks per year. Current Federally Approved State Rule Requirements Michigan's Rule 336.1621 establishes VOC emission limits for miscellaneousmetal coating operations and specifies a final compliance date of December31, 1983. Rule 336.1621 was approved by USEPA as part of Michigan's PartD SIP on June 29, 1982 (47 FR 28097). The emission limits in R336.1621require at least the applicaton of RACT as required by section 172(b) ofthe Clean Air Act (CAA). The paint operations at the Romeo plant are presentlysubject to the VOC limit of 3.5 lbs. of VOC/gallon of coating, minus water,as applied, for ``extreme performance'' coatings set forth in R336.1621(1)(c).Proposed Emission Limits Consent Order No. 3-1985 would revise the existing SIP requirements inR336.1621 for the six paint operations at the Romeo Tractor and EquipmentPlant described above as follows: 1. Three paint operations covered by the rule (the industrial tractor paintrepair booth, the agricultural tractor paint repair booth and the touch-uppaint repair booth) would have a higher final emission limit of 4.8 poundsof VOC/gallon, minus water, as applied for standard and specialty colors.2. The final compliance date for all six paint operations covered by theOrder would be extended to December 31, 1986. 3. Interim emission limits established for all six paint operations from1983 to the final 1986 compliance deadline exceed the 3.5 pound/gallonlimit set forth in R336.1621. 4. The MAPCC could establish ``equivalent'' emission limits expressed interms of pounds of VOC per gallon of solids applied. 5. Compliance with the emission limits would be determined as a 24-hourweighted average of all the standard and specialty colors used. The currentrule requires compliance with the VOC limits to be met on an instantaneousbasis. There is no provision for averaging over time. Specifically, Consent Order No. 3-1985, includes the following complianceschedule and emission limits for each of the six paint operations coveredin the order: Flat Deck Chassis Paint Booth andbullet; Until December 31, 1984, VOC emissions from application of allstandard and specialty colors shall not exceed 5.4 pounds of VOC per gallonof coating, minus water as applied, based on a 24-hour averaging period.andbullet; By December 31, 1984, and until December 31, 1986, the VOC emissionsfrom the application of all standard and specialty colors shall not exceed3.7 pounds of VOC per gallon of coating, minus water, as applied, basedon a 24-hour averaging period. andbullet; After December 31, 1986, the VOC emissions from the applicationof all standard and specialty colors shall not exceed 3.5 pounds of VOCper gallon of coating, minus water, as applied, based on a 24-hour averagingperiod. Straddle Mount Chassis Paint Booth andbullet; Until December 31, 1985, VOC emissions from application of allstandard and specialty colors shall not exceed 5.2 pounds of VOC per gallonof coating, minus water, as applied. andbullet; By December 31, 1985, and until December 31, 1986, the VOC emissionsfrom the application of all standard and specialty colors shall not exceed4.3 pounds of VOC per gallon of coating, minus water, as applied, basedon a 24-hour averaging period. andbullet; After December 31, 1986, the VOC emissions from the applicationof all standard and specialty colors shall not exceed 3.5 pounds of VOCper gallon of coating, minus water, as applied, based on a 24-hour averagingperiod. Small Parts Paint Booth andbullet; Until December 31, 1985, VOC emission from the application ofall standard and specialty colors shall not exceed 5.3 pounds of VOC pergallon of coating, minus water, as applied. andbullet; By December 31, 1985, and until December 31, 1986, the VOC emissionsfrom the application of all standard and specialty colors shall not exceed4.3 pounds of VOC per gallon of coating, minus water, as applied, basedon a 24-hour averaging period. andbullet; After December 31, 1986, the VOC emissions from the applicationof all standard and specialty colors shall not exceed 3.5 pounds of VOCper gallon of coating, minus water, as applied, based on a 24-hour averagingperiod. Industrial Tractor Paint Repair Booth andbullet; Until December 31, 1985, VOC emissions from the application ofall standard and specialty colors shall not exceed 5.9 pounds of VOC pergallon of coating, minus water, as applied, based on a 24-hour averagingperiod. andbullet; By December 31, 1985, and until December 31, 1986, the VOC emissionsfrom the application of all standard and specialty colors shall not exceed5.2 pounds of VOC per gallon of coating, minus water, as applied, basedon a 24-hour averaging period. andbullet; After December 31, 1986, the VOC emissions from the applicationand specialty colors shall not exceed 4.8 pounds of VOC per gallon of coating,minus water, as applied, based on a 24-hour averaging period.

Michigan requested and obtained from USEPA an extensionfor achieving the ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) forthe Detroit Metropolitan area, including Macomb County, to December 31,1987. Michigan was, therefore, required by the Clean Air Act (CAA) to submita revised ozone plan for the Detroit area by July 1982, which demonstratedattainment of the ozone NAAQS not later than December 31, 1987. On April3, 1983, Michigan submitted its 1982 Ozone SIP for the Detroit urban area,which USEPA proposed to disapprove on June 14, 1984, (49 FR 24544) dueto the failure of the plan to demonstrate attainment. Michigan submitted a revised 1982 Ozone SIP on June 12, 1985. The impactof the relaxations in this Consent Order on air quality and maintenanceof reasonable further progress (RFP) are taken into account in the ozoneattainment demonstration for the Detroit nonattainment area that was partof the June 12, 1985, submittal. The attainment demonstration, as submitted,predicts attainment of the ozone standard by 1987 as required by the CAAand USEPA guidelines. However, USEPA has not approved the State's proposedrevised ozone plan for the Detroit Urban area. USEPA's SIP revision policyrequires that the SIP include an approvable attainment demonstration, underwhich it can be determined that a proposed relaxation will not interferewith RFP toward, and timely attainment of, the ozone NAAQS. The Michigan Ozone SIP has been submitted to USEPA in large part, but isstill undergoing USEPA review. USEPA's preliminary review indicates thatthe Michigan ozone plan lacks certain required RACT rules and other SIP-relatedelements. In a separate action USEPA will be addressing the deficienciesassociated with the State of Michigan's proposed 1982 Ozone SIP revision.The attainment demonstration that Michigan submitted with its ozone planpurports to show attainment by the end of 1987 on the basis of reductionsin VOC emissions in part from sources for which no RACT rules have beensubmitted. Michigan's failure to submit these rules means that it has notdemonstrated that the associated VOC reductions will occur, and thus thatattainment will occur by the end of 1987 or even shortly thereafter. Inaddition, under USEPA policy, even if attainment were projected to resultsoley from VOC reductions associated with sources other than those forwhich no RACT rules have been submitted, RACT rules for all sources coveredby RACT requirements are necessary as an additional safeguard for attainment.For this reason, too, the lack of RACT rules means USEPA cannot approvethe Michigan SIP. However, under EPA's emissions trading program, sources covered by RACTemission limits may be allowed to replace those limits with less stringentlimits by obtaining emission credits from other sources in the area. Thosecredits must be obtained in accordance with the procedures establishedin the emissions trading policy and will generally be obtained by applyingcontrol to previously unregulated sources, by applying emission limitsthat are more stringent than RACT to other sources, or by taking creditfrom certain source shutdowns. It should be noted that EPA recently notifiedthe Governor of Michigan that its ozone SIP for the Detroit area is substantiallyinadequate to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standardfor ozone and that Michigan must revise the plan. This action has the effectof reinforcing the area's classification as an area ``needing but lackingan approved attainment demonstration'' under the emissions trading policy,and thus requires any request for approval of an emissions trade to usea more stringent emissions ``baseline'' on which to determine surplus emissionscredits. Equivalent Emission Limitations The consent decree would allow the MAPCC to determine and establish ``equivalent''emission limits for the Romeo paint operations expressed in terms of poundsof VOC per gallon of solids applied. A determination of ``equivalent''emission limits would require an evaluation of the baseline and actualtransfer efficiency of the operations. Determining equivalent emissionlimits is not straightforward for miscellaneous metal sources because thereis no pre-established baseline transfer efficiency (as exists for automotiveand large appliance sources). For this reason, the formulation of equivalentemission limits for this type of source would involve the exercise of significantdiscretion by the State. Under sections 110(a)(2) and 172(b) of the Clean Air Act, USEPA can approveSIP provisions only if they do not interfere with timely attainment andmaintenance of the national ambient air quality standards. USEPA cannotbe assured that the State's exercise of discretion in choosing equivalentemission limits for this type of source will be adequate to protect thestandard. Consequently, USEPA cannot approve this equivalency provisionas a ``generic'' authorization for the state to adopt new federally enforceablelimits without USEPA's subsequent case-by-case approval. Since the stateapparently intended that USEPA approve this equivalency provision as sucha generic authorization, USEPA proposes to disapprove the provision. <T3>Relaxed Final Emission Limit For Final Repair Operations </T3>Michigan justified the proposed relaxed limit of 4.8 pounds of VOC pergallon for the three tractor paint repair operations by stating that R336.1621includes this same limit for truck final repair coatings. Michigan believesthat the 4.8 limit for truck final repair should also apply to tractorfinal repair because ``the air dry and color match requirements necessitatingthe 4.8 limit for trucks also exist for tractor final repair.'' However, the existence of a 4.8 lbs/gal limit on truck final repair isnot a basis for relaxing the tractor final repair limit. Michigan mustpresent a basis for its position that a limit of 3.5 lbs/VOC gallon isnot RACT for these sources at the Romeo Plant. Compliance Date Extensions USEPA has determined that the State has failed to adequately demonstratethat the December 31, 1986 compliance date extension is as expeditiousas practicable in accordance with the Clean Air Act and USEPA's policyon compliance date extensions. In particular, the State has not adequatelyresearched the compliance status of similar sources to determine if complianceby the original deadline was reasonable. Nor has the State demonstratedthat the compliance date extension will not interfere with reasonable futherprogress toward attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standardfor ozone. Therefore, USEPA is proposing to disapprove the compliance dataextension. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action </ITAG>USEPA is proposing to disapprove Consent Order No. 3-1985 for the FordMotor Company's Romeo Tractor and Equipment Plant, for the following reasons:(1) The State failed to demonstrate that the compliance date extensionis as expeditious as practicable in accordance with USEPA's August 7, 1986,policy. (2) The order includes an equivalency provision that would grant the stateoverbroad discretion to change the SIP unilaterally in a manner that mayinterfere with timely attainment and mainteance of the ozone standard.(3) No documentation was provided to demonstrate that a final repair limitof 4.8 lbs. voc/gallon of coatings is consistent with RACT and that theexisting SIP limit of 3.5 lbs. of VOC/gallon for these operations is infeasible.(4) The source is located in Macomb County, an urban nonattainment areawhich currently lacks an approvable 1982 Ozone SIP. A 30-day public comment period is being provided on this notice of proposeddisapproval rulemaking. Public comments received on or before August 19,1988 wil be considered in USEPA's final rulemaking action. Under Executive Order 12291, this action is not ``Major''. It has beensubmitted to the Ofice of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP disapproval action willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities because this action applies to only one source. In addition, thisaction imposes no additional requirements on the source. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 </ITAG>Air pollution control, Ozone, Intergovernmental relations.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: March 31, 1987. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Valdas V.
