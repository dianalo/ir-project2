These products are expanding the frontiers of science, revolutionizingthe art of medical diagnosis, and developing the energy technology ofthe future. In general, today's customers for superconductive equipmentwant the highest possible performance, almost regardless of cost. Theproducts operate within a few degrees of absolute zero, and virtuallyall are fabricated from niobium or niobium alloys-so far the high-temperaturesuperconductors discovered in 1986 and 1987 have had no impact on thesemarkets. The industry shows potential and profound societal impact, evenwithout the new materials.</TEXT></DOC>
