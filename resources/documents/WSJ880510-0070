Malcolmson resigned following what it called a &quot;serious breach&quot; of its conflict-of-interest guidelines.    Ermanno Pascutto, commission director, said Mr. Malcolmson failed to pay fees to a registered dealer and traded in the securities of a company that had filings before the commission, Canada's leading securities regulator.    Mr. Malcolmson, who was the agency's third highest-ranking regulator, couldn't be reached for comment. He had been in charge of deregulation policies and foreign broker registrations.    The commission said the Ontario Provincial Police has been investigating Mr. Malcolmson since last summer and recently the police disclosed certain information about his investments. The commission declined to discuss the investigation and a spokesman for the police wasn't available.    The commission released correspondence from Mr. Malcolmson and his Toronto financial adviser, Andrew Sarlos, which said that Mr. Sarlos acquired stock for Mr. Malcolmson in Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. in 1985. In a letter to the commission, Mr. Sarlos, who runs a Toronto investment concern, said he didn't charge Mr. Malcolmson any fees for his service. He also said he didn't advise Mr. Malcolmson of the purchase in Gulf Canada, which is controlled by the Reichmann family of Toronto. The shares were later sold for a profit of 6,000 Canadian dollars.    Mr. Pascutto said the purchase of Gulf Canada shares and the absence of investment fees were a &quot;serious breach&quot; of the commission's conflict-of-interest policies. Gulf Canada had made certain filings to the commission, and the agency's policies prohibit employees involved in such filings from trading in the company's securities. Although Mr. Sarlos said Mr. Malcolmson wasn't aware of the share purchase, Mr. Pascutto said employees &quot;should know what transactions they are entering in.&quot;    Mr. Pascutto said it was also a breach of policy not to pay Mr. Sarlos a fee because &quot;Mr. Malcolmson was seen as accepting a benefit&quot; from a registered dealer that the commission regulates.    Mr. Malcolmson is the commission's first senior regulator to resign over its conflict-of-interest policies, which were introduced about eight years ago. </TEXT></DOC>
