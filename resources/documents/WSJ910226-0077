For years, the Pentagon by law made almost all of itsclothing purchases from small suppliers. Now, however, muchof the clothing worn by U.S. military personnel -- fromdesert-camouflage fatigue pants to Marine dress-blue suitcoats -- comes from such brand-name suppliers as HartmarxCorp., maker of Hart Schaffner andamp; Marx suits, and WranglerJean Co.</LP><TEXT>   The change, made at the urging of civilian advisers led bythe president of Brooks Brothers, resulted largely fromunbridled greed: To gain an advantage in military clothingcontracts, some small suppliers began paying bribes togovernment officials. After a federal investigation calledOperation Thimble led to the suspension of many smallcontractors in the mid-1980s, the Defense Department beganrunning short of clothing providers.   So, the Pentagon in 1988 received permission from Congressto switch to big suppliers for some of its clothing needs,which total hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Thesmall-business share of military apparel purchases has sincebeen cut nearly in half, to about 50% from 98%, and somesmall suppliers have folded.   Some of the brand-name apparel is just now being rushed tothe front in the Persian Gulf. The buildup of U.S. troopsthere necessitated quick delivery on big orders of desertfatigues. In October, the Pentagon awarded a $17 millioncontract to Wrangler, a unit of VF Corp., Wyomissing, Pa., tomake one million pairs of trousers for delivery startingwithin 90 days. The pants, with the Wrangler name stamped onthe inside, recently began reaching troops.   Wrangler's pants have more shades of tan than themilitary's previous pattern, which was designed for theCalifornia desert and had black and white specks. Catalogcompanies and distributors of military paraphernalia haveasked about ordering Wrangler's pants for civilian sale, thecompany says, but it won't take those orders until itfulfills its government contract.   The war is rapidly pushing up the Pentagon's clothingbudget, which had been $700 million for the current fiscalyear. Because of the Gulf crisis, the government has alreadycommitted to another $500 million in clothing contracts andexpects the total to rise still further.   Pentagon officials like the flexibility of being able tocall on big manufacturers as well as small ones. Smallsuppliers, of course, aren't so pleased about the change. &quot;Wewere a little sorry to see&quot; the military move away from usingonly small companies, says Michele Luna, treasurer of AtlasHeadwear Inc., Compton, Calif.   Atlas has two military contracts valued at a total ofabout $2 million: for 250,000 desert hats -- which look likefishing hats, with a brim all the way around -- and for100,000 camouflage baseball caps. But rather than rely onlyon defense business, the family-owned company also makes capsfor uniforms worn by employees of McDonald's Corp. andPillsbury Corp.'s Burger King division, as well as &quot;charactermerchandise&quot; for Walt Disney Co., such as caps with MickeyMouse on them.   On the other hand, John Nicholson, president of TennesseeApparel Co. of Tullahoma, Tenn., says his company hassurvived doing only government work by taking on specialtyitems such as coldweather military gear and chemicalprotection suits now in demand in the Gulf.   Big clothing makers are happy to get a reliable piece ofbusiness during the recession. Thorngate Uniforms, a divisionof Chicago-based Hartmarx, landed a three-year, $1.5 millioncontract to make the suit coat that goes with the MarineCorps dress blue uniform. Thorngate says the contractrepresents a big chunk of its roughly $10 million in annualrevenue.   This month, Work Wear Corp., based in Greensboro, N.C.,received a $14 million contract to make 671,000 shirts in thedesert camouflage pattern, to be delivered in 60 days. WorkWear, which specializes in work clothes, has annual sales ofmore than $160 million.   Londontown Holdings Corp., a unit of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.,has had a series of military clothing contracts. It currentlyhas a $3.4 million order to make 56,000 women's London Fograincoats for the Coast Guard.   The new approach to clothing purchases was suggested by aPentagon advisory board headed by William Roberti, presidentof Brooks Brothers, a unit of Britain's Marks andamp; Spencer PLC.Mr. Roberti, also a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Armyreserves, says the government wasn't taking advantage of itsability to &quot;do business with someone who's an expert.&quot;   A longstanding federal law had required the government touse small firms because of a general philosophy of supportingsmall business. But the Pentagon decided to look intorecruiting larger companies after Operation Thimble turned upevidence of widespread bribery among small suppliers. As aresult of the probe, from 1985 to 1988 some 35 smallcompanies were permanently disqualified from doing businesswith the government; another 21 firms and individuals wereexcluded from working for the Pentagon for certain periods.   But the Pentagon had so much trouble finding alternativesuppliers that it had to award one contract for Navy jumpersto Dale Fashions Inc. even though the small New Jerseycompany had been barred from government business. Thecompany's president subsequently pleaded guilty to conspiracyand fraud charges in federal court in Philadelphia.Investigators said he admitted to paying $470,000 in bribesto 11 government officials.   The investigations have ended, defense officials say, buta number of suppliers that relied solely on governmentcontracts have folded. And small suppliers seeking contractsmust now compete with the bigbrand boys.   The military also has changed how it chooses contractorsand its relationship with them. The lowest bidder no longerhas an automatic advantage. Instead, companies are evaluatedfor the quality of their work, delivery schedule, andtechnical and management skills. &quot;We used to tell acontractor step by step how to make a shirt,&quot; says thePentagon's Dennis Dudek. &quot;Now, we go to a manufacturer whoknows how.&quot;   For example, the Coast Guard used as its starting point aLondon Fog raincoat instead of asking the company to startfrom scratch in devising a garment to militaryspecifications. Among other things, Londontown shortened thecoat's belt so that it would buckle tightly in military stylerather than hang down loosely to be casually tied together.</TEXT></DOC>
