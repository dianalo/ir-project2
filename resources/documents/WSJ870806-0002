Pentagon officials said the contract represents the largest U.S. military sale to China thus far. Under the Reagan administration's generally liberal policies toward China, the country has become eligible for advanced weapons and militarily usable civilian products that routinely are denied to the Soviet bloc.    The contract was awarded on the same day that China announced the purchase of two Lockheed Corp. L-100-30 airlift planes.    The Grumman transaction will enable China to improve the performance of its F8 fighters, which are based on now-obsolete Soviet designs. &quot;The systems we're selling the Chinese include components comparable to early F-16 avionics technology,&quot; an Air Force spokesman said.    In two earlier transactions, the Pentagon agreed to sell China $98 million in high-precision artillery shells and a smaller amount in radar and radio sets.    Although Bethpage, N.Y.-based Grumman will supply equipment and services to the Chinese, the Air Force will be the official vendor under the terms of a foreign military sales arrangement with China.    In the Lockheed transaction, the aircraft being acquired by the Civil Aviation Administration of China are civilian versions of the rugged C-130 Hercules that the U.S. Air Force uses to drop paratroops and fly supplies to poorly equipped airstrips. The state-owned Chinese carrier intends to use the L-100-30s exclusively for a new air-cargo service between the mainland and other Asian countries.    The price for the transaction wasn't disclosed. A Lockheed spokesman said such information is &quot;proprietary.&quot; The civilian version, which already has been sold to more than 20 other countries, is believed to be priced below the $18 million that the Air Force pays for each C-130, which is made by Lockheed's Marietta, Ga.-based subsidiary, Lockheed-Georgia Co.    China earlier wanted to buy the C-130 for air-sea rescue work, but the Pentagon balked at giving the Chinese the full military version with its sophisticated electronics. In other respects, though, U.S. export-control authorities are treating China far more generously than any member of the Soviet bloc.    For instance, McDonnell Douglas Corp. has been able to obtain licenses to ship some avionics for the MD-80 commercial airliner that it and the Chinese are coproducing in Shanghai, according to China trade sources. The C-130 and its civil variants, as well as the MD-80 avionics, aren't permitted to be sold to the Soviet bloc.    Richard Gillespie, an executive of the Washington-based National Council for U.S.-China Trade, predicted the Reagan administration will further liberalize licensing regulations for shipments to China by year-end. </TEXT></DOC>
