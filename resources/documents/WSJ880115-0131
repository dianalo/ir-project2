Scientists at the National Institutes of Health reported the finding in a preliminary study of dideoxycytidine, or DDC, a drug developed at NIH and licensed to Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, N.J., the U.S. unit of F. Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co. of Switzerland. The report is scheduled for publication today in the British journal The Lancet.    DDC, when administered alone, gave half of 20 patients in the study a peripheral neuropathy -- tingling, numbness and pain -- principally in the feet. At its worst, the nerve damage brought treatment to a halt, and sometimes took months to disappear.    Like its sister compound, AZT, which is manufactured by Burroughs-Wellcome Co., DDC slips false building blocks into the genetic material of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus, halting its reproduction. AZT prolongs survival of AIDS patients, but is toxic to the bone marrow, and causes anemia requiring blood transfusions in roughly half of those who receive it.    However, in a study of six patients given a regimen of DDC for one week followed by AZT for one week, patients escaped both the neuropathy and the anemia, scientists said. Patients also experienced a drop in the level of virus in their blood and increased production of T4 cells, white blood cells which are part of the body's immune response.    The results were cheered by scientists at Hoffmann-La Roche, who were discouraged when DDC's toxicity began to show up last summer. &quot;The neuropathy was a disappointing surprise,&quot; said L. Patrick Gage, vice president for exploratory research. He added he is excited about the Lancet report for showing &quot;there is a way out.&quot;    Despite such encouraging signs, scientists emphasized that the test, a phase one study, is preliminary and doesn't prove clinical effectiveness. Phase one studies are designed to assess safety and toxicity. Phases two and three essentially determine effectiveness. Further studies are needed to find out whether the drug lengthens or improves the quality of life for AIDS patients.    &quot;We don't know if the drug has clinical efficacy, as defined by FDA. We don't know if it's better than AZT. But we do know we can get around the toxicity,&quot; said Samuel Broder, chief of clinical oncology at the National Cancer Institute and a co-author of the study with another NCI scientist, Robert Yarchoan.    Scientists also said that they are uncertain whether the combination is superior to either drug given alone with a rest period in between doses. Such potent anti-virals might best be administered in low-dose regimens, with pauses built in to rest the body and rebuild nerves and bone marrow, Dr. Broder said.    Whaijen Soo, a Hoffmann-La Roche scientist, said the company plans to enlarge its DDC studies, testing the drug at lower doses with rest periods. Dr. Soo added that the drug also will continue to be tested in alternation with other drugs by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a unit of NIH. </TEXT></DOC>
