Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's de facto dictator, was ordered to resign as head of the military by his handpicked civilian president. But the general showed no sign of complying, and the army last night had already taken action to support him.    President Eric Arturo Delvalle's statement on national television last night and his announcement of a successor to head the defense forces will further increase international and internal pressure on the embattled general.    However, the Associated Press quoted the designated replacement, Col. Marcos Justines, late last night as refusing the president's appointment. &quot;I reject that order.&quot; And Gen. Noriega was receiving other support from the country's military and police, who have effective control over Panama.    His troops went to the streets last night in a show of power and broke up small demonstrations supporting the president's announcement. The deputy chief of staff and the police commander, both colonels in the army, backed Gen. Noriega in televised statements. Gen. Noriega remained silent.    Panamanian sources in the U.S. opposed to Noriega said last night that the army had removed guards from around President Delvalle's residence, and that they had fears for his safety. A U.S. state department official, however, said that Mr. Delvalle was receiving diplomats, church officials and friends.    The Reagan administration, which has lately been promoting Gen. Noriega's ouster, came down firmly on the side of President Delvalle. One Panamanian opposition source suggested that the Reagan administration had itself coordinated the move with the Panamanian president during a recent visit he made to the U.S., ostensibly for medical treatment.    &quot;At this time, we want to reiterate our unqualified support for civilian constitutional rule in Panama,&quot; said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. &quot;There is but one legitimate sovereign authority in Panama and that is the Panamanian people exercising their democratic right to vote and elect their leaders in a free society.&quot;    Gen. Noriega was indicted early this month by two federal grand juries in Florida on drug and racketeering charges, and the U.S. has cut off military and economic aid to the country.    Whether President Delvalle's order can help remove Gen. Noriega is uncertain, but Latin American diplomats said it would make it more difficult for the military leader to govern and could convince fellow officers that it is time to oust the country's only general. The Dominican Republic has offered Gen. Noriega asylum, and other countries are considering political sanctions if he doesn't step down.    &quot;This will make it much more difficult for Noriega to deal with Latin American countries,&quot; said Guatemala's ambassador to the Organization of American States, Francisco Villagran. &quot;Our government and other governments recognize President Delvalle as the legitimate constitutional president of Panama.&quot;    Mr. Villagran said his government has instructed him to support a call for an emergency session of the OAS, if President Delvalle wants such a move. &quot;We are prepared to give him our support if he asks for it,&quot; he said.    President Delvalle's announcement appeared partially to be pre-emptive. Rumors that Gen. Noriega was planning to depose Mr. Delvalle in a coup d'etat have been swirling through the capital since the president's return from his trip to the U.S. last week.    Yet even if Gen. Noriega digs in his heels, Reagan administration officials say the Panamanian government's growing financial problems eventually may prompt his ouster. Diplomats and economists say the country is quickly running out of money to pay its public sector employees, who have until now formed the nucleus of the general's civilian support. Analysts speculate that even support within the military might wane if the cash crunch worsens.    Such problems have been exacerbated by the freeze on U.S. economic and military aid to the country, and by the government's inability to refinance its foreign debt. Many of the country's largest loans fall due next month. Moreover, Panama's currency is the American dollar, and hence Gen. Noriega can't meet payrolls by printing more money.    Administration officials said they didn't see any immediate danger to the 10,000 American soldiers in Panama or 40,000 other American residents. &quot;Everything is normal,&quot; said a Pentagon spokeswoman. She wouldn't comment on whether troops were on a heightened alert status, but she said American Forces radio and television stations in Panama had advised soldiers to &quot;exercise extreme caution and avoid areas where there are likely to be demonstrations.&quot;    State Department officials hadn't heard from Gen. Noriega last night and were closely monitoring a general staff meeting at which he was believed to be deciding his strategy. U.S. officials and Panamanian opposition leaders have been quietly appealing to junior officers to turn against their commander, according to a senior Reagan administration official, but there weren't yet any open signs of dissension.    Officers en route to the general staff meeting told reporters they backed Gen. Noriega completely. &quot;None of us wants to be commander,&quot; said Col. Leonidas Macis, military chief of policy. &quot;Our commander is staying.&quot;    &quot;This isn't going to work for them,&quot; said Gabriel Lewis, the former Panamanian ambassador to the U.S. who now heads the Washington office for the National Civic Crusade for Panama, a group opposed to Gen. Noriega. &quot;If he doesn't go peacefully to the Dominican Republic, then he will have to go the hard way because the economic pressure will grow as he becomes increasingly isolated.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
