(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dunkin' Donuts officials say they arelooking more closely at a merger offer from a Canadian partnershipafter rejecting a bid by the same group earlier this month.   The international doughnut chain is also considering otheralternatives, including a leveraged buyout or selling the companyto a third party.   In a letter sent Monday to the chain's 1,108 franchisees, RobertM. Rosenberg, chairman and chief executive officer, wrote thatDunkin' Donuts management met Sept. 19 with representatives of DDAcquisition Corp., which had made a bid for the company in August.   DD Acquisition Corp. is a partnership between Cara OperationsLtd., a restaurant franchise company, and Kingsbridge Capitalgroup, the merchant banking arm of Toronto investor George Mann'sUnicorp Canada Corp.   The letter said DD's increased cash offer of $45 a share, or$308 million, along with its willingness to drop most conditionspreviously imposed in the deal, had prompted the meeting.   DD Acquisition raised its offer late last month from $43, butDunkin' Donuts announced two weeks ago that it would reject thehigher offer.   DD had filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court challenging aserious of tough anti-takeover defenses Dunkin' Donuts hadimplemented. Rosenberg's letter said that DD had agreed to drop itssuit and its challenge of all measures except a ``poison-pill''plan Dunkin' Donuts had implemented.   The poison pill increases the number of shares in the event of atakeover, making a merger prohibitively expensive.   The letter said DD Acquisition had extended its tender offer toNov. 1.   Rosenberg also wrote that Dunkin' Donuts was meeting with otherpossible buyers, and also might consider a leveraged buyout plan.In a leveraged buyout, the asset value of a company is used tofinance most or all of the debt.   ``Whether or not an LBO might be pursued and might be in thebest interests of the stockholders has not yet been determined,''the letter read. ``But the possibility of financial support fromfranchise owners is likely to play an important role in ourevaluation of the LBO alternative.''   Company officials would not comment on the letter.   Dunkin' Donuts reported a 34 percent drop in third-quarterearnings, much of which it attributed to costs associated withbattling the hostile takeover.</TEXT></DOC>
