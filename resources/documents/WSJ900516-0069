Peter Magowan, the boyish-lookingchairman and chief executive of the world's largestsupermarket chain, rose to offer a toast to the deal that hadfended off a hostile takeover by the corporate raidersHerbert and Robert Haft.   &quot;Through your efforts, a true disaster was averted,&quot; the44-year-old Mr. Magowan told the other directors. By sellingthe publicly held company to a group headed by buy-outspecialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. and members ofSafeway management, &quot;you have saved literally thousands ofjobs in our work force,&quot; Mr. Magowan said. &quot;All of us --employees, customers, shareholders -- have a great deal to bethankful for.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Nearly four years later, Mr. Magowan and the KKR group canindeed count their blessings. While they borrowed heavily tobuy Safeway from the shareholders, last month they sold 10%of the company (but none of their own shares) back to thepublic -- at a price that values their own collective stakeat more than $800 million, more than four times their cashinvestment.   Employees, on the other hand, have considerably lessreason to celebrate. Mr. Magowan's toast notwithstanding,63,000 managers and workers were cut loose from Safeway,through store sales or layoffs. While the majority werere-employed by their new store owners, this was largely atlower wages, and many thousands of Safeway people wound upeither unemployed or forced into the part-time work force. Asurvey of former Safeway employees in Dallas found thatnearly 60% still hadn't found full-time employment more thana year after the layoff.   James White, a Safeway trucker for nearly 30 years inDallas, was among the 60%. In 1988, he marked the one-yearanniversary of his last shift at Safeway this way: First hetold his wife he loved her, then he locked the bathroom door,loaded his .22-caliber hunting rifle and blew his brains out.   &quot;Safeway was James's whole life,&quot; says his widow, Helen.&quot;He'd near stand up and salute whenever one of those truckswent by.&quot; When Safeway dismissed him, she says, &quot;it was likehe turned into a piece of stone.&quot;   Few financial maneuvers have drawn more controversy thanthe leveraged buy-out, or LBO, a relatively old money-makingtactic that was dusted off and put to extensive use in the1980s, thanks largely to the rise of junk-bond financing.   In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors thatgenerally includes senior management borrows heavily to buy acompany from public shareholders and takes it private. Thedebt is to be rapidly repaid from the company's own cash flowor from sales of its assets.   The returns on some such highly leveraged investments havebeen astronomical, enriching such financiers as Henry Kravis,Ronald Perelman and Nelson Peltz to a degree unheard of sincethe days of the Robber Barons. Proponents of LBOs argue thatthey are good for business and good for America, triggeringlong-overdue crash weight-loss programs for flabbycorporations. By placing ownership in the hands of a smallgroup of investors and managers with a powerful debt-drivenincentive to improve productivity, the argument goes,companies can't help but shape up.   The Safeway LBO is often cited as one of the mostsuccessful in this regard. It brought shareholders asubstantial premium at the outset, and since then the companyhas raised productivity and operating profits and producedriches for the new investors and top management. &quot;We couldnot have done what we did do without going through theincredible trauma and pressure of the LBO,&quot; Mr. Magowan saidin late 1988.   But while much has been written about the putativebenefits of LBOs, little has been said about the hundreds ofthousands of people directly affected by the past decade'sbuy-out binge: employees of the bought-out corporations. Inthe case of Safeway, a two-month investigation of the buy-outreveals enormous human costs and unintended side effects. Thecompany dropped tens of thousands of employees from itspayroll, suppliers and other dependent industries laid offhundreds more, and communities lost the civic contributionsof a firm whose first store had been opened by a clergymanwho wanted to help his parishioners save money.   When Safeway itself selected a group of its employees tospeak to this newspaper on behalf of the company, not one ofthose interviewed praised the buy-out. &quot;I think LBOs are veryugly,&quot; said Carl Adkins, an inventory control clerk whodescribed himself as happy with his job. &quot;I think they areharmful to individual working people. I think they honestlystink.&quot;   Moreover, the evidence doesn't entirely support theargument that the LBO made Safeway a healthier institution.The supermarket chain cut plenty of muscle with the fat, bothfrom its holdings and from its labor force, and deferredcapital improvements in favor of the all-consuming debt. Manyemployees find the post-LBO working environment moredifficult -- as a company legendary for job security andfairness resorts to hardball labor policies and high-pressurequota systems.   Just before the Safeway deal was struck in 1986, Mr.Magowan's mother grew worried about the employees. Thesupermarket dowager wanted to be sure the LBO wouldn't damageSafeway's longstanding reputation as a benevolent employer.   Will anyone get hurt? Mrs. Magowan pressed her son at thetime, according to company staff members. Will anyone losehis job?   No Mom, Mr. Magowan promised, according to the staffers'account. No one will get hurt.   &quot;Yes, I was greatly concerned about the people,&quot; Mrs.Magowan recalls today, in her mansion overlooking the SanFrancisco Bay. She declines to comment further.   Mr. Magowan's recollection: &quot;Well, I don't ever remembersuch a conversation ever occurred. . . . I might have saidthings like, `We're going to do the best we can for ouremployees and I'm hopeful that we are going to be able tokeep the vast majority with the new owners.'&quot;   In any event, before that summer was out, Mrs. Magowan'sson had begun firing Safeway employees. Not long after,Safeway replaced its longtime motto, &quot;Safeway OffersSecurity.&quot; The new corporate statement, displayed on a plaquein the lobby at corporate headquarters, reads in part:&quot;Targeted Returns on Current Investment.&quot;   ---   Before the LBO, Safeway was hardly a prime example of thesluggish, out-of-shape sort of company that LBO proponentslike to target. Founded in 1926, it had grown under Magowanfamily leadership to encompass more than 2,000 stores in 29states and in England, Australia, Canada and Mexico. Mr.Magowan's father, Robert, had largely built Safeway, and hismother, Doris Merrill Magowan, is the daughter of a founderof Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., which helped finance Safeway'sgrowth.   Many companies, including Safeway, had allowed theirpayrolls to become bloated in certain underperformingdivisions, and layoffs were common throughout large Americancompanies during the last decade.   But Safeway was already doing -- albeit at a slower pace-- many of the things LBO experts advocate. It was remodelingits stores and creating the upscale &quot;superstores&quot; that havenow proved such a big success. It was experimenting withemployee productivity teams, phasing out money-losingdivisions, and thinning its work force with a program thatincluded some layoffs but generally relied on less painfulmethods like attrition.   All these changes produced earnings that more than doubledin the first four years of the 1980s, to a record $231million in 1985. The stock price tripled in three years, anddividends climbed four years in a row.   But all that wasn't enough for takeover-crazed WallStreet, where virtually no company was invulnerable tocash-rich corporate raiders. When the deep-pocketed Haftsbegan buying Safeway shares in the open market and thenoffered to buy the company for as much as $64 a share,management felt it had to take defensive action. Selling tothe Hafts might have cost Chairman Magowan his job and, hefelt, ultimately might have brought a breakup of the company.   Safeway considered and rejected a plan to fend off theHafts through a so-called recapitalization. This was a movethat its supermarket-industry competitor, Kroger Co. woulduse two years later to keep the same raiders at bay whileallowing shareholders to realize a big one-time gain.   The decision to sell to KKR instead brought immediatebenefits to some. Shareholders got $67.50 a share -- 82% morethan the stock was trading at three months before -- pluswarrants that give them a 5.6% stake in the ongoing company.Employees owned roughly 10% of Safeway shares at the time ofthe buy-out.   Mr. Magowan and other directors and top executivesreceived $28 million for their shares, $5.7 million of whichwent to Mr. Magowan. He and about 60 other top executivesalso got options to buy a total of 10% of the new Safeway atonly $2 a share; those options are now valued at more than$100 million, or $12.125 a share.   The Hafts made $100 million by selling the Safeway sharesthey had accumulated to KKR, and as a consolation prize, theywere also given options to buy a 20% stake in the newSafeway. The Hafts sold that option back to KKR 2 1/2 monthslater for an additional $59 million.   The three investment banks that worked on the deal made atotal of $65 million. Law and accounting firms shared another$25 million.   And then there are Henry Kravis, George Roberts, about adozen other KKR employees and the 70 investors KKR broughtinto the buy-out. KKR itself charged Safeway $60 million infees just to put the deal together. The five KKR partnersthen put up a small fraction of the equity funding -- 1.1%,or roughly $2 million -- and received a 20% share of theeventual profits from any sale of Safeway.   KKR's investor group, half of which consists of statepension funds and which also includes banks, insurancecompanies and even Harvard University, got most of the rest.   Mr. Roberts rebutts the notion that too few people reallybenefit in an LBO. He says that some of &quot;our 70 limitedpartners represent retired teachers, sanitation workers andfiremen, and 80% of our profits go to them.&quot;   But at the largest of those investors, Oregon'spublic-employee pension fund, LBO investments make up only atiny portion of investments and thus haven't had &quot;asignificant impact&quot; on retirees' benefits to date, accordingto Bob Andrews, fund manager.   ---   The immediate gains for some triggered immediate costs forothers. The first employees to be fired shortly after thebuy-out's completion were more than 300 staffers from Oaklandcorporate headquarters and a nearby division in Walnut Creek,Calif. The following spring, the entire Dallas-area divisionwas shut down, and nearly 9,000 more employees were dismissed-- employees with an average length of service of 17 years.   &quot;This is going to kill people,&quot; transportation managerRichard Quigley says he told his boss when he learned thatlayoffs would take place.   On the Friday afternoon before the dismissals went intoeffect, Patricia Vasquez, a 14-year systems analyst, heardthat her name was on the list. That evening, Mrs. Vasquez, aSafeway devotee famous for her refusal to take lunch hours,packed her service citations in a cardboard box and leftlooking pale and drawn. The next morning her two youngchildren found their single mother on the bathroom floor,dead of a heart attack.   That Monday, Mr. Quigley came home with the news that he,himself, would be fired. His worried wife's blood pressurebegan to rise. A diabetic who had been in good health foryears, she was hospitalized by Labor Day weekend -- and deadby Sept. 5. Rightly or wrongly, Mr. Quigley blames his wife'sdeath on his Safeway layoff: &quot;She was very traumatized byit.&quot;   Told of these deaths and several suicides that familymembers and friends attribute to the Safeway layoffs, Mr.Magowan says: &quot;I never heard of this before. If it's true,I'm obviously sorry about such a tragic thing, but anyattempt to associate this directly with the LBO shows adisposition to want to believe the worst of LBOs.&quot;   For many at Safeway, firing day was only the first in along series of financial and emotional body blows.   &quot;The dominoes began to tumble and they crashed for a longtime to come,&quot; says Ron Morrison, a former corporate systemsmanager. When Mr. Morrison lost his 14-year job, his fianceannounced she couldn't marry an unemployed man.   He found work as a transportation analyst at Del Monte,but then KKR bought that company, too -- and he was laid offagain, just before Thanksgiving. By the time 1990 rolledaround, Mr. Morrison had not only gone through two KKR-ledLBOs, he had lost his second home and was unemployed again.   &quot;Right now I pretty much live in a cocoon,&quot; Mr. Morrisonsays. &quot;You begin to pull in your tentacles because you can'tafford to have any more cut off.&quot;   While at Safeway, Mr. Morrison says, he helped conduct atransportation study that trimmed millions from the companytransit budget. And he wasn't the only fired employee atheadquarters whose work had brought the company big savings.Refrigeration engineer Mikhail Vaynberg, a Soviet emigre,says he invented a new cooling system for the stores that cutenergy costs 35%, saved $1.6 million a year, and was copiedby many suppliers. (A Safeway spokesman says the companydoesn't contest these cost-saving claims.)   After he was fired, Mr. Vaynberg couldn't find work in hisfield and, like many other employees fired at headquarters,says he couldn't get a current letter of recommendation fromSafeway; he says his boss told him he wasn't allowed tosupply a written reference because &quot;you might use it to suethe company.&quot; (A Safeway spokesman says it is company policynot to grant reference letters for &quot;good, sound legalreasons,&quot; but maintains that managers were allowed to makeexceptions for employees laid off in the 1986 firings atheadquarters.)   Mr. Vaynberg says his greatest blow came a few weeks afterthe layoff, when his only son dropped out of engineeringschool weeks shy of graduation: &quot;The country doesn't wantengineers: Look what happened to you,&quot; he told his father.Now Mr. Vaynberg, still unemployed, spends his days in apainfully clean living room, prowls the halls at night andavoids old friends and neighbors. &quot;I am ashamed,&quot; he says,staring at his big empty hands. &quot;I am like an old thrown-outmop.&quot;   Safeway fired its corporate employees with no notice, cutoff their medical insurance in as little as two weeks andprovided severance pay of one week's salary for every year ofservice, to a maximum of just eight weeks. And to get thepay, many employees say they were told to sign a letterwaiving their right to contest the severance package later.(A company spokesman says the letter wasn't a waiver butsimply an &quot;acknowledgment&quot; that they understood the terms.)   Mr. Magowan concedes that many of the people fired atheadquarters in the summer of 1986 were &quot;very good&quot;employees. The cuts were made in a hurry, as he said later ina court deposition, so as &quot;to put this whole unpleasantmatter behind us as soon as possible.&quot; For such haste,Safeway would wind up paying $8.2 million to settle awrongful termination class-action suit and $750,000 to settlea separate suit for age discrimination.   One executive who left headquarters voluntarily wasaccorded much better treatment. Safeway president JamesRowland was granted a $1 million bonus when he retired a fewmonths after the buy-out.   Mr. Rowland advised Mr. Magowan in a memo to approve thebonus privately and divide the amount into smaller portionswith labels like &quot;paid consultant.&quot; The reason, as Mr.Rowland wrote: &quot;Peter, I do not want to put you in anembarrassing situation.&quot;   (Mr. Rowland, reached at his Arkansas home, says he nevergot a &quot;million-dollar bonus. I got my regular bonus. I justdon't recall what it was. I'm not going to go back and rehashall that.&quot; He then hangs up. Mr. Magowan says Mr. Rowlandwasn't paid a lump sum of $1 million. He was paid hisprevious year's bonus, which he had earned, plus an advanceon consulting work he would do for Safeway, Mr. Magowan says.&quot;It wouldn't have been some side deal under the table betweenJim Rowland and me that nobody knew about. That's not mystyle.&quot;)   ---   &quot;I wouldn't be surprised if 11,000 jobs were created outof&quot; the roughly 9,000 jobs lost, Mr. Magowan announced to thepress after he closed the Dallas division. He says he assumedthat other grocery chains would expand to fill the Safewayvacuum. &quot;What I'm talking about here is a theory of mine,&quot; hesays later. &quot;I will get right up front and say I don't havefacts to support it.&quot; Mr. Magowan says he has not been backto Dallas since the closure.   When the Dallas division shut down, the state unemploymentoffice had to open on the weekend -- for the first time ever-- just to accommodate the Safeway crowds. The Dallasemployees had a thin financial pallet to cushion the blow.Their severance pay was half a week's pay for each year ofservice, up to a maximum of eight weeks.   And their severance checks didn't start arriving untilJuly 1987, three months after the shutdown. Russell Webb, a12-year produce clerk and single father with three children,didn't get his severance check for eight months. Vacation payarrived even more slowly: First the union had to go toarbitration to get it; then, the company didn't start mailingthe checks until February 1989. Safeway says the severanceand other checks arrived late because they weren't part ofthe union contract and thus &quot;had to be negotiated.&quot;   In addition to Mr. White's suicide, at least two otherstried to kill themselves. One was Bill Mayfield Jr., amechanic in the Safeway dairy since it opened in 1973, whoslashed his wrists, then shot himself in the stomach; thebullet just missed his vital organs and he survived.   &quot;I would say {the layoff} devastated about 80% of thepeople in the division,&quot; says Gary Jones, president ofSafeway's credit union in Dallas, which eventually had towrite off $4 million in loans. &quot;Overnight we turned from alending institution into a collection agency.&quot; At one point,more than 250 repossessed cars were sitting in his parkinglot.   KKR and Safeway blame organized labor for the fall of theDallas division. Once the leading grocer in the area, Safewayhad seen its market share fall by nearly half in the '80s.KKR and Safeway officials say the company was paying too muchin wages, some 30% more than rivals, thus preventing it fromcutting prices, remodeling stores and the like.   But rival Kroger was also a union shop, and it found a wayto prosper and expand in Dallas by renovating stores andnegotiating lower wages with the union. Its market share wason the rise. The Kroger case suggests that the Safewaylayoffs might have been necessitated as much by mismanagementas by labor costs. Some company officials concede thatSafeway had other problems besides wages in Dallas: Itsstores were too small, too old and poorly designed.   While grocery competitors in Dallas eventually bought morethan half the 141 Safeway stores, they were less eager topick up the unionized workers. According to a state-fundedsurvey of the displaced workers, stores under new managementtypically recalled no more than a half dozen of the 40 to 60former Safeway employees who staffed each outlet.   And wages fell sharply, no matter where the workerslanded: In 1988, according to the survey, ex-Safewayemployees reported that their average pay had dropped to$6.50 from $12.09 an hour.   Cindy Hale, an 11-year Safeway employee, saw her wagesfall to $4 an hour when she took an identical grocery clerk'sjob with AppleTree Markets, at an old Safeway store. Her newemployer would only hire part-time, so Ms. Hale, a singlemother, lost her medical benefits. She eventually lost herhouse, too, and had to send her son to live with her parents.   &quot;But it really wasn't as bad for me as the others,&quot; saysMs. Hale.   For Dallas employees, working for Safeway had often been atotal family experience, and many households lost more thanone income after the buy-out. The Seabolts lost three:Husband, wife and daughter all got their pink slips on thesame day. Ron Seabolt, who worked in the company'sdistribution center for 17 years, searched for months beforetaking a job as a janitor. Now he works at the post office.   Kay Seabolt, a human resources supervisor at Safeway and a17-year company veteran, counseled ex-employees for a yearunder a state job-placement retraining program. The program'scounselors sometimes fished into their own pockets to buygroceries for those who streamed through the counselingcenter, an abandoned Safeway office. When Safeway sold it,the new owners evicted them.   Seared into Mrs. Seabolt's memory is the day one tatteredman arrived at the office. A long-timer in the Safeway breadplant, the middle-aged baker made his way to her desk with aslow, wincing limp. He apologized for his appearance,explaining that he had just walked six miles from thetemporary labor pools: His car had been repossessed. He wasliving in a homeless shelter. &quot;I gave him a few job leads,&quot;she recalls, &quot;but he was pretty shabby and I didn't hold outmuch hope.&quot; Before he left, she slipped him some money forbus fare, she says. &quot;I never saw him again.&quot;   When the layoff rumors first began circulating, ClaraSanchez took to praying in the parking lot of Store No. 677.Her silent pleas went unanswered. On April 24, 1987, she andher husband, Jesse, lost their jobs. She had been a checkerfor 12 years; he had been an order filler in the warehousefor 18 years.   Clara could find no work, and is still unemployed; Jessesearched for eight months before the city hired him to cutgrass for $3.55 an hour. Then he washed cars for $4.50 anhour. Two months later, he was laid off. Finally, with$14,000 in unpaid bills, the Sanchezes filed for bankruptcy.   The church sent canned goods, and Mr. and Mrs. Sanchezskipped supper some evenings so their children could eatbetter. After a while, Mr. Sanchez was too depressed to eatanyway. &quot;I wasn't a man; I wasn't worth anything as far as Iwas concerned,&quot; he says. &quot;Why live if I can't support mykids?&quot; One Friday night, Mr. Sanchez told his wife he wasgoing to watch a wrestling match, but went to a friend'shouse instead with a business proposition: &quot;I told him Iwould pay him $100 to take my life. I didn't own a gun or Iwould've done it myself.&quot; The friend put his gun out of reachand sent Mr. Sanchez home.   When Safeway pulled out of Dallas, the shock waves didn'tstop at the supermarket doors. The shutdown led to secondarylayoffs at almost all the big food and beverage vendors intown, and some construction businesses suffered. For Harry W.Parks Co., a general contractor, Safeway represented 85% ofannual revenues; Mr. Parks had dropped most of his otherclients to assist Safeway in its big remodeling program inthe early '80s. After the pullout, his company nearly folded,all but three employees were laid off, and Mr. Parks had aheart attack and died.   &quot;Safeway was his whole world,&quot; says his son, Harry Jr.&quot;That's all he cared about for 30 years. When they pulledout, it was like his whole family died.&quot;   The North Texas Food Bank suffered, too. It lost afounding member and its leading contributor; Safeway used todonate 600,000 pounds of food a year.   &quot;The bottom line,&quot; food-bank director Lori Palmer says,&quot;is fewer people ate.&quot;   ---   The layoffs in Oakland, Dallas and elsewhere were just onepart of KKR's broad-based plan to cut costs, boostprofitability and meet the stiff interest and principaldeadlines set by the company's lenders and debt-holders.About 1,000 of the company's stores were sold, as were 45plants and other facilities.   Safeway put whole divisions in Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansasand Utah among others on the auction block. They were sold toa few grocery chains, many other LBO investors and, in somecases, real-estate investors.   The real-estate investors didn't rehire any Safewayworkers: They converted the properties to video shops, thriftstores, and in one case a bingo parlor. Some were boarded up.   While grocery chains bought some Safeway stores just toshut them down and reduce competition, other chains boughtwhole Safeway divisions and kept most of the workers; theBritish and Oklahoma divisions are examples of this. In othercases, new owners retained only selected workers. Invirtually all cases, though, new ownership meant pay cuts.   In what seemed at first the best deal for employees, thegrocery chain Borman's Inc. bought the entire Safeway Utahdivision and hired virtually all the workers. But nine monthslater, these 3,000 employees lost their jobs when Borman soldthe division, piece by piece, to local competitors andinvestors. Only a few of the stores in the Salt Lake Cityarea still operate as supermarkets.   Don Schanche, a Safeway meatcutter in Salt Lake City for25 years, spiraled downward from his $12.33 hourly pay atSafeway to a reduced wage scale at Borman's &quot;Farmer Jack&quot;outlet, to an unsuccessful appeal for any minimum-wageemployment at the same store, which had been bought by hisold manager. Now Mr. Schanche drives by a &quot;for lease&quot; sign infront of the store, which is empty, having gone belly-up. Mr.Schanche is making a living as a &quot;job coach&quot; in astate-funded displaced-workers program -- where he iscurrently counseling other ex-grocery store employeesfollowing an LBO involving their employer, Alpha-Beta.   Mr. Magowan, as Safeway's CEO but no longer the man withfinal decision-making authority, was at first opposed to theextent of the divestiture program, people familiar with thesituation say. He liked being the head of the world's largestsupermarket chain. But KKR officials gave him little choiceif he wanted to stay on board, these people say.   Mr. Magowan himself says that &quot;no one twisted my arm&quot; overthe restructuring. Still, he says he &quot;regrets&quot; sellingpromising divisions, mentioning in particular Los Angeles, ElPaso, Tulsa, and Little Rock.   Still others point with regret to the loss of thecompany's 132-store British division -- a top-performer knownin-house as the &quot;jewel&quot; of the Safeway collection -- and thesale of Safeway's successful discount chain of liquor stores,Liquor Barn, which under its new owners (Majestic WineWarehouses Ltd.) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protectionin 1988.   Despite such regrets, however, Mr. Magowan is now aself-professed believer in the LBO concept. For one thing,his own performance has been rewarded under KKR, which hasincreased his annual compensation by about 40% to $1.2million including bonus. His bonus potential has climbed to110% of base pay from 40% before the buy-out, and he hasearned the highest possible bonus every year.   Many things have gone well for the buy-out group.The saleof the British division alone brought $929 million, part ofthe $2.4 billion that KKR got from asset sales -- or 40% morethan KKR officials say they had projected.   Thanks to sales of some money-losing operations, Safeway'sbasic business could earn more without raising prices. Thecompany's stores are now No. 1 or 2 in most of its markets.By 1989, operating profit per employee was up 62% from 1985,and operating margins had increased by nearly half. Thecompany is producing nearly twice as much annual cash flow asit needs to cover yearly interest payments. As a result,Safeway has been able to pay bank lenders ahead of scheduleand negotiate lower interest rates.   Finally, KKR and Safeway officials also credit a newcombination of incentives and quotas that they say makeworkers more entrepreneurial and at the same time moreaccountable.   Mr. Magowan says that employees are thriving in thispost-LBO culture: &quot;I am convinced that today's typicalSafeway employee feels better about the company than he orshe has at any point since the buy-out.&quot; Store managers, hesays, &quot;genuinely enjoy this extra responsibility&quot; of meetingnew quotas.   Not every part of the new Safeway picture is as rosy asMr. Magowan portrays it, however.   The public offering completed recently didn't quite go asplanned. The offering's underwriters knocked the price downto $11.25 from the $20 a share envisioned last summer. Mr.Magowan himself concedes, &quot;I think if we had known right atthe start that this was the price that we would've gotten, weprobably wouldn't have come out with our offering.&quot; He blamesthe much-publicized problems of other leveraged companies forunjustly tainting Safeway's offering and driving away stockshoppers.   But some potential investors say that it was Safeway's ownfinancial condition that turned them off.   The company labors under an interest bill of about $400million a year, a negative net worth of $389 million, and aremaining $3.1 billion in debt. The company's net income wasonly $2.5 million last year (after accounting fornonrecurring expenses), down from $31 million the yearbefore. Safeway lost a whopping $488 million in 1987, thefirst year of the LBO.   A large amount of capital improvement has been postponed,with such annual spending falling from an average $600million to $700 million in the three years before the buy-outto an average of $300 million in the years since. The companyestimates it must spend $3.2 billion on store remodeling andopenings over the next five years. And Safeway now has fewassets left that it can justify jettisoning.   ---   When Mr. Magowan in 1988 sat down with a group ofspecially selected employees to tell them the story of &quot;ourgrowing success,&quot; the workers had a different story to tellhim, as chronicled by the company's own magazine, SafewayToday.   &quot;The morale in Richmond {Calif.} right now is down to rockbottom,&quot; Vince Macias, a 25-year trucker, told the boss. Headded that drivers were forced to pull as much as 16-hourshifts and were so overworked they were &quot;dangerous&quot; on thehighways.   &quot;The morale is so bad in some of our stores,&quot; ChristieMills, a San Jose employee, told him, that it's driving awaycustomers.   &quot;There aren't many of us, and hours are cut back so much,&quot;said Cheryl Deniz, a bakery clerk. &quot;I don't let the customersee it, but inside I'm miserable. . . . I want to be happywhen I wait on them. . . . I try my best, but sometimes I'mso overloaded. It's unfair to the customer, and it's unfairto the employee. . . . And some of you feel the same way.&quot;   Mr. Magowan looked around the room. &quot;I see everybodynodding their heads to what you are saying,&quot; he told her.Then he added: &quot;I've heard this before.&quot;   (A Safeway spokesman says the company immediately followedup on the workers' complaints and that Mr. Magowan personallywrote letters to those employees who voiced concerns.)   Certainly many employees have emerged unscathed from theLBO and feel comfortable working under the new regime. A goodnumber of them even applaud the company for its rapidsurfacing from the debt depths.   But among a group of workers that Safeway supplies to thisnewspaper as a sampler of &quot;happy employees,&quot; no oneinterviewed is praising the LBO.   &quot;We've recovered well,&quot; says Jim Ratto, a Safeway liquormerchandiser. &quot;But personally, I think Safeway would havebeen better off if we had never gone through the leveragedbuy-out. It definitely added some problems, and the companywould have been farther ahead now if it had never happened.&quot;   &quot;Safeway's made a beautiful comeback, we're getting on ourfeet again, and I have no complaints,&quot; says George Voronin,an affable wine steward who says &quot;I always try to look on thepositive side.&quot; But even Mr. Voronin adds, &quot;When someonecomes in and takes all your funds and sells your stores,isn't that what we in the United States call dishonest?&quot;   The new esprit de corps trumpeted in the executive suiteis less apparent in the grocery aisles, where store employeessay the KKR-inspired quotas -- based on complexreturn-on-market-value formulas -- create anxiety as well asproductivity. And the pressure mounts as one goes down thechain from manager to checker.   While Safeway executives call the quota program an&quot;incentive&quot; plan, some store managers refer to it as &quot;thepunishment system.&quot; That's because store managers say if theydon't make the week's quota, they can be penalized. In somedivisions they report that they must work a seven-day week aspenance. Working a month without a day off isn't unusual,managers in the Washington and California divisions say. Insome stores managers who miss quota say they have to pull 6a.m. to 6 p.m. shifts.   Mr. Magowan says corporate headquarters sets no suchpenalties. &quot;I have never heard of any such program,&quot; he says.&quot;I simply do not believe for one second that this is anywidespread activity.&quot; A company spokesman says that at least50% of store managers are meeting their quota.   Even among the list of satisfied employees that Safewayprovides, many aren't profiting from the incentive plan.Either they are too low on the totem pole to get a bonus(with a few exceptions, only department heads and higherqualify), or their departments aren't generating enough salesvolume to meet the demanding quotas. Mr. Voronin, whose winedepartment has been on the incentive plan for two years, hasyet to get a bonus. Mary Wise is head of the floraldepartment, but the company hasn't yet cut her into the plan.She says she doesn't mind: &quot;I leave feeling good, knowing Idid the job right, and for me, that's my bonus.&quot; She adds,&quot;But I'm one of those people you look at and say, `Oh, why isshe always so happy?'&quot;   In Seattle, only one of more than a dozen store managersin one district expects to meet quota this year, managerssay. Last year, none made more than 20% of their bonuspotential, the store heads say. A Safeway spokesman says mostmanagers in that region are making their quota.   On Safeway's home turf in the San Francisco area, managersare &quot;stepping down&quot; and becoming checkers. Some have beenforced to turn in their manager badges when they didn't meetquota; others say they are voluntarily taking lower statusand pay -- out of exhaustion.   &quot;A number of store managers have stepped down, this yearparticularly,&quot; a company spokesman acknowledges. &quot;In recentyears, the job has gotten tougher.&quot;   In the wake of the LBO, the company was able to squeezelabor concessions from the unions, using the Dallas shutdownas an object lesson of what can happen when labor costs aredeemed too high. With the debt hovering overhead, you could&quot;get the labor concessions you deserve,&quot; Mr. Magowan says.   &quot;It was like coming to the table with a gun at our heads,&quot;recalls Ed Hardy, a United Food and Commercial Workersnegotiator. While the company's average hourly wage rate hasrisen slightly in the last three years -- the exact amount isconfidential, Safeway says -- the small increase trails theinflation rate.   The strategy of catering to the upscale at many stores hasalso enabled KKR to cut service workers' wages even further.To staff trendy specialty departments, Safeway has hired&quot;general merchandise clerks,&quot; a classification that pays aslittle as half the wages of food clerks.   This disparity troubles even the upbeat floral managerMary Wise. &quot;Gosh, you can barely live on what they are payingthem,&quot; she says. She broached the subject with Mr. Magowan atthe 1988 meeting. These specialty clerks are performing a jobthat requires training and skill, she said, and &quot;Safewayshould pay them accordingly.&quot;   Mr. Magowan's response, as quoted in the company'smagazine: &quot;The problem, Mary, is this. The reason we got thelower GMC {general merchandising clerk} rate was to allow ourlabor costs to be competitive.&quot; But he reassured her that thecompany was taking steps to make up for the low pay. &quot;WhatI've suggested from time to time is saying, `Do you likeweekends off? Do you like to work 8 to 5?' . . . We'll giveyou the lower rate but a better schedule.' That might makethem very happy.&quot;   ---   In one division, Safeway has extended the incentiveprogram beyond the department manager level in an experimentaimed at letting all workers benefit in the enhancedproductivity they are generating. Employees in the Denverdivision took a 14% pay cut, but were assured that, onaverage, the new profit-sharing plan would more than make upthe difference. The company acknowledges this hasn't happenedin nearly half the cases; the union estimates that even fewerincreased their earnings.   Store employees in Denver also complained about the waythe incentive system was linked -- as it is throughout thecompany -- to grievances and work-related medical claims.&quot;Managers have been saying to people, don't file workman'scomp because it will hurt the bonus,&quot; says Charles Mercer,president of the Denver local of the United Food andCommercial Workers. Mr. Magowan concedes that the Denverbonus plan is &quot;not very popular.&quot;   Mr. Magowan's assertion that Safeway's culture is morecollegial now also doesn't always square with the view fromthe retail floor. In stores around the country, employeesreport that management is pushing out older, skilled andwell-paid employees, turning to cheap part-time help (whodon't get medical insurance and other benefits) and pilingextra work on the remaining staff. Union officials estimatethat the average age of the stores' work force has dropped 10years since the buy-out; a company spokesman disputes this,but says Safeway doesn't track age.   &quot;Safeway used to be one of the best places to work of theretail grocers,&quot; says Rowena Schoos, a middle-aged Safewaymeatcutter in Oregon for five years. &quot;But after the buy-out,they started cutting hours to the nitty-gritty, the storemanagers went into mass panic, and Safeway just turned into aburnout company.&quot;   Ms. Schoos recently left herself, after she was cut backto 16 hours a week and lost her medical benefits. Like manyof the older and well-paid meatcutters, she says, she wasrelegated to the &quot;extra board,&quot; a tour of duty that canrequire driving more than 100 miles a day to different storesto fill in where needed.   For the older butchers, many of whom suffer physicalinjuries from the years of toting and carving, the assignmentis the final shove out the door. Ms. Schoos, for example, hastwo herniated discs, which she attributes to years of lugging100-pound carcasses.   A Safeway spokesman responds, &quot;That's just another case ofan isolated situation. She was just not performing the jobadequately,&quot; and thus her hours were cut.   The company also says that meatcutters' numbers have beenreduced primarily because a gradual shift to pre-packagedgoods in meat processing has lessened the need. Employees inthe meat department argue that even with the changes, much ofthe work still requires a butcher's expertise and that thecutbacks have been too severe.   While on the extra-board circuit, Ms. Schoos had theopportunity to observe the LBO-fallout at many stores. &quot;Itwas the same thing everywhere I went,&quot; she recalls. &quot;Themanagers were desperate to meet quota and the older peoplealways got it the worst. They'd bust them back to lowerpositions. One produce manager was told he had a `choice' --go back to being a checker or get fired. One lady asked for abreak, and the manager cut her from 40 to eight hours.&quot;   In response, Mr. Magowan produces a recent employee surveyconducted in the Portland, Ore., division that finds thatmore than 80% of employees feel Safeway offers advancementopportunity and other advantages. &quot;These would be good scoresto decertify the union should we ever wish to do so,&quot; Mr.Magowan says, adding, &quot;which we have no intention of doing,whatsoever.&quot;   Closer to headquarters, at the Market Street store in SanFrancisco, employees report a grind of tension and overwork.Some say they are shouldering as many as nine different jobs.In the meat department, the butchers' numbers have been cutback sharply and inexperienced clerks take up the slack.&quot;Everyone is burned out,&quot; says another employee, who pointsto a counter where overripe meat is on display, the result ofa hasty stocking effort. &quot;It's a whole new ballgame andeveryone's discontented.&quot;   In the Market Street store, employees complain thatclipboard-toting managers patrol the floors, closelymonitoring performance and filing a blizzard of disciplinaryreports. A company spokesman disputes these accounts: &quot;Thereis no ROMV {Return on Market Value} police.&quot;   Last month, at the Market Street store, food clerk SteveDolinka lost his job after 25 years of service. Hismalfeasance: He says he forgot to pay for the cup of soup andtoast he ate at the deli on his lunch hour. Mr. Dolinkaapologized, shelled out the few dollars that his food cost,and explained why he was so distracted -- his mind was on amurder trial that had ended a few weeks earlier. Agas-station robber was before the court charged with slittingthe throat of Mr. Dolinka's 15-year-old son in 1982 in anassault that the investigating detective called &quot;the mostbrutal in my experience.&quot;   &quot;My wife says I've been forgetting things a lot lately,&quot;Mr. Dolinka says.   &quot;In our business, employee theft is a serious problem,&quot; acompany spokesman says of Mr. Dolinka's expulsion. &quot;And everyemployee is treated the same way.&quot;   Mr. Dolinka says he doesn't blame his manager for thefiring. &quot;The way it works here, I don't think any of themanagers have the freedom to make these decisions. It's allcoming down from company policy, and they have got to followit like their bible.&quot;   To all such reports from the store front, Mr. Magowan sayshe's skeptical: &quot;Our productivity is up,&quot; he points out.Employees are donating more to Easter Seals, and workers'compensation claims are down, he says. And when theearthquake hit, &quot;our employees stayed up all night cleaningup their stores.&quot;   &quot;Are these acts of a disgruntled work force?&quot; he asks. &quot;Idon't think so.&quot;   George Roberts, one of KKR's two principal partners, notesthat workers at many corporations are being asked to do more,whether an LBO is involved or not. Employees &quot;are now beingheld accountable,&quot; Mr. Roberts says. &quot;They have to produce upto plan, if they are going to be competitive with the rest ofthe world. It's high time we did that.&quot;   ---   David B.
