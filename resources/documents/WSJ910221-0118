I hope that you get out ofthere quickly.&quot;   Mr. Popov's fears are increasingly credible. Whethersuccessful or not, Moscow's peace overture is a dangeroussignal of a return to form in Soviet foreign policy. We arelikely now to face a renewed time of troubles in which theSoviet Union makes common cause with Third Worlddictatorships, fosters anti-Western sentiments and challengesthe U.S. The growing evidence of anti-U.S. hostility andpro-Saddam sentiment in Soviet pronouncements on the Gulf warsubstantiates these fears.</LP><TEXT>   In the early days of the Gulf crisis, the Soviet press wasnearly unanimous in its harsh criticism of Saddam. A Sept. 17Tass commentary lauded U.S.-Soviet cooperation in condemning&quot;Iraq's aggression.&quot; As late as December, Radio Moscow wasunequivocal in its condemnation of Iraq and effusive itspraise for President Bush's willingness &quot;to walk an extramile to avoid war.&quot; Anti-Iraq feeling was fueled by SaddamHussein's hostage policy, which trapped Soviet citizens.   Yet even before the January crackdown in the Balticstates, the military, the KGB, and party hard-liners werepressing for a reversal of the pro-U.S. tilt. On Dec. 12, anarticle by E. Shchekatikhin in the KGB Border Guardsnewspaper, Pogranichnik, attacked the democratic press,including the &quot;liberal&quot; weeklies Ogonyok and Moscow News fortheir forthright condemnations of Saddam Hussein. The articlesuggested that much of the Soviet media was in the hands ofZionists, that Kuwait was historically a part of Iraq andthat Saddam commanded overwhelming support in the Arab world.   The military joined in. On Feb. 13, a news conference oftop-ranking political officers from the armed forces and theKGB border guards denounced &quot;the U.S.-led attempt to destroyIraq.&quot; In a bitter touch of irony, Lt. Gen. AleksandrOvchinnikov, the deputy head of the Armed Forces PoliticalAdministration, compared the suffering of Iraqi civilians tothat of Soviet servicemen stationed in the Baltic republics.   Unsurprisingly, the reactionary newspaper SovietskayaRossiya has also expressed pro-Iraq views. On Feb. 12, thedaily asserted that the decision by Moscow to back the UnitedNations coalition had &quot;ended the U.S.S.R.'s existence as asuperpower.&quot; The daily also has frequently opened its pagesto Iraq's ambassador to Moscow, who on Feb. 5 appealed to theSoviets to &quot;play a positive role and not allow thedestruction of a friendly country and the liquidation of itspeople.&quot;   Most recently, circles close to President Gorbachev havebegun to adopt a strident anti-Americanism. Pravda inparticular has changed its rhetoric. Its foreign policycommentator Vladimir Ovchinnikov spun a fantastic tale of aU.S. plot to control the world economy in a Feb. 8 story.&quot;Taking the oil fields of the Persian Gulf under Americanmilitary control,&quot; he wrote, &quot;would put pressure on thecompeting centers of economic might -- Japan and WestEurope.&quot; Appearing on Central Television in a prime timebroadcast the next day, Mr. Ovchinnikov used rhetoricreminiscent of the Brezhnev years: &quot;I am afraid that themission endorsed by the United Nations to liberate Kuwaitwill turn into a neocolonialist action&quot; that will &quot;ensuredominance in the world economy for U.S. monopolies.&quot;   Mr. Gorbachev's military adviser, Marshal SergeiAkhromeyev asserted on Jan. 10 that the war in the Gulf &quot;willnot be a local conflict.&quot; He claimed not only that &quot;mostArabs support Saddam Hussein&quot; but that &quot;the whole Arab worldwill be implicated, the ground will burn under people's feet. . .&quot;   The Soviet government has begun to attempt to restrict thecoalition's scope of action. The Supreme Soviet Committee onInternational Affairs declared on Feb. 4 that military actionin the Gulf &quot;is already exceeding the U.N. mandate.&quot; Andinfluential Soviets have begun to express muffled threats ofwhat could happen if their message is ignored. Gorbachevloyalist Boris Oliynik, the deputy chairman of the Soviet ofNationalities (one of the two chambers of the SovietParliament), told a Communist Party plenum on Jan. 31 that&quot;the consequences of `Desert Storm' {are} threatening todevelop into the hurricane of World War III.&quot; The term isominous as for the moment there is only one antagonistcapable of turning the conflict between an isolated Iraq anda U.N.-sanctioned international coalition into a world war --the Soviet Union.   Such a formulation may still be too harsh for today'scorrelation of forces. Thus, the military and Sovietjournalists have begun to present the conflict as a&quot;sub-world-war,&quot; in which the ecological catastrophe issuingfrom Gulf warfare, coupled with the possible use of nuclear,chemical and biological weapons, spills across borders andbegins to affect life throughout the region and in the SovietUnion.   Increasing emphasis is now placed on the fact that theregion of conflict is only a few hundred kilometers fromSoviet territory. Soviet forces along the southern bordershave been placed on a state of alert, according to MarshalSergei Akhromeyev, in order &quot;to strengthen the air defensesystem.&quot;   On Feb. 8, the Army daily Krasnaya Zvezda rebuked ForeignMinister Aleksander Bessmertnykh for contending that &quot;thereis no danger at present, neither from radiation, nor chemicalnor biological {weapons}.&quot; And Maj.-Gen. Viktor Filatov,editor of Questions of Military History, a journalinfluential among the officer corps, launched a frontalattack in early February, charging that &quot;under a differentforeign policy&quot; and a &quot;different foreign ministry&quot; the waragainst Iraq would have been prevented.   The Kremlin has not yet created insurmountabledifficulties for the U.S. in its war with Iraq, but it hasretreated from its earlier cooperation. And on the evidenceof recent pronouncements, things are likely to get worse.   ---   Mr. Karatnycky is director of research at the AFL-CIODepartment of International Affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
