Copper for March delivery lost 1.3 cents a pound to end at$1.0095.</LP><TEXT>   Prices had risen sharply in the past week. At its peakTuesday of $1.03, copper was at its highest level in 12weeks. When it failed to rise above that level, traderslocked in their profits by selling offsetting contracts,analysts said.   Since mid-January, March copper has rebounded from alife-of-contract low of 93.7 cents, its lowest level since1988. The rise has been fueled by strong demand from China aswell as optimism about the economy, said William O'Neill,senior futures strategist at Merrill Lynch. But the demandfrom China has slowed recently, he said, and the economyisn't showing enough growth to justify prices above therecent highs.   On a technical basis, copper prices could be expected tofall back to test the $1 level, said John Gross, a WestNyack, N.Y., metals consultant. If prices remain above $1,they will probably move higher, he said. But if they fallbelow that level, they could again decline to 95 or 96 cents.   But based on fundamentals, copper prices should remainsteady or move higher, analysts said. Stocks held in exchangewarehouses have declined by about 10% since the beginning ofthe year, Mr. Gross said, and domestic consumer and producerinventories are very low.   Fred Demler, metals economist at PaineWebber, said thatduring the two or three years of economic expansion thattypically follow recessions, copper inventories have fallenan average of one million tons. This time, however, there'sless metal available to start with. Stocks currently totalonly 900,000 tons, he said.   Demand for the physical metal is improving in the U.S. butis still weak in Germany and Japan, Mr. Demler said. Much ofthe recent strength in copper reflected anticipation ofimproved consumption by year's end as the economy improvesrather than current conditions, he said.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Despite fairly widespread expectations of acontinued decline, crude oil futures prices rebounded a bitin trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. March cruderecovered 29 cents a barrel after falling $1.34 Tuesday. Manytraders and analysts had said that the market would keepsliding, reflecting a lack of confidence in OPEC's ability tocurb production. The Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries reached a production accord in Geneva over theweekend that was generally thought not to go far enough inlimiting output. Nonetheless, yesterday saw March crude moveback up to $18.41 a barrel, with outer months higher as well.The American Petroleum Institute's weekly report on U.S.petroleum inventories, usually out on Tuesdays, was releasedyesterday instead because of Monday's Presidents' Dayholiday. It showed a decrease of two million barrels in crudestocks and an increase of 2.9 million barrels in gasolinestocks. Distillates showed a decline of nearly six millionbarrels. Refinery runs fell to 78.9% of capacity.                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Commodity funds, apparentlyanticipating a seasonal rise in beef prices, helped pushcattle futures prices higher at the Chicago MercantileExchange. Analysts said the funds, which are managed pools ofinvestor money, may have been buyers yesterday because of thestrong tendency of beef prices to rise in April. Futuresprices had dropped sharply since last week, analysts said,affording a buying opportunity for bullish investors. Yetyesterday's price run-up had an immediate consequence thatmay exert downward pressure on futures prices, said DanVaught, livestock analyst for A.G. Edward andamp; Sons Inc., St.Louis. After the price of the February contract, which is nowin delivery, settled 0.57 cent higher at 78.97 cents a pound,93 notices to deliver cattle were issued. The deliveries,coupled with price declines yesterday on the cash market forbeef, are expected to put downward pressure on futures pricestoday.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Futures prices ended slightly higher. Aftersetting a life-of-contract low of 66.25 cents a pound, thelowest price since 1975, coffee for March delivery ended up0.1 cent a pound at 66.8 cents. Melissa Trout, an analyst atCargill Investor Services, said prices fell sharply onTuesday when traders construed as negative for coffee pricesa speech by a U.S. trade official at the National CoffeeAssociation convention in Boca Raton, Fla. The comments castdoubts on U.S. support for a return to an internationalprice-support system, she said. There's no reason for pricesto recover because the fundamentals are so negative, shesaid. There's also talk that producers still have a lot offutures selling to do to hedge their inventories, she said.Prices will probably remain within a range of 55 to 70 centsover the next couple of months, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
