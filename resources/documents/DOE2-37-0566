Dual-energy subtractionradiography was performed in 41 cancer patients in whom the tumor shadowwas equivocal or the border of cancer infiltration was not clearly demonstratedby compression mammography, and 15 patients with benign diseases suchas fibrocystic disease, cyst and fibroadenoma. In 21 cases out of the41 cancer patients, the dual-energy subtraction radiography clearly visualizedthe malignant tumor shadows and the border of cancer infiltration andthe daughter nodules by removing the shadows of normal mammary gland.On the other hand, beign diseases such as fibrocystic disease and cystcould be diagnosed as such, because the tumor shadow and the irregularlyconcentrated image of mammary gland disappeared by the dual-energy subtraction.These results suggest that this new technique will be useful in examinationof breast masses.</TEXT></DOC>
