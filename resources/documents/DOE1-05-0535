Flowing blood within thefalse lumen was seen as MR signal in 31 patients. Analysis of a variedMR signal intensity within the false lumen allowed the pathophysiologicaldetection of aortic dissection, such as the presence of entry, abdominalcommunicating orifice, and retrograde dissection. The flow void phenomenon,as seen in the limited intraluminal range, provided useful informationon the presence of entry and abdominal communicating orifice. Increasedretrograde signal intensity within the false lumen seemed to be of importancein the diagnosis of retrograde dissection. The use of a spin-echo pulsesequence with long echo times and short repetition times was useful inthe differential diagnosis of flowing blood and thrombus within the falselumen.
