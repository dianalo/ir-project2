<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-76-1190 </DOCNO><TEXT>The basic principle of activation analysis is: a sample is exposed toa particle flux so that nuclear reactions can take place. If the elementof interest, by means of a nuclear reaction, gives rise to a radioactivenucleus, the subsequent decay may cause the emission of a radiation thatidentifies the parent nucleus. By measuring its intensity the quantitativedetermination of the element of interest is possible. A survey is givenof the most significant nuclear reactions in activation analysis, inducedby thermal neutrons and light ions, of the particle sources and of thedetector systems for registration of the decay spectra. Methods for absolutemeasurement of biological samples, their precision and accuracy are discussedand applications in biomedical studies are commented. 32 refs.; 20 figs.;4 tabs.
