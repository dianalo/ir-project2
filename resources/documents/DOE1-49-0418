<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-49-0418 </DOCNO><TEXT>The diagnosis of white matter abnormalities was revolutionized by theadvent of computed tomography (CT), which provided a noninvasive methodof detection and assessment of progression of a variety of white matterprocesses. However, the inadequacies of CT were recognized early, includingits relative insensitivity to small foci of abnormal myelin in the brainwhen correlated with autopsy findings and its inability to image directlywhite matter diseases of the spinal cord. Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI), on the other hand, sensitive to the slight difference in tissuecomposition of normal gray and white matter and to subtle increase inwater content associated with myelin disorders, is uniquely suited forthe examination of white matter pathology. Its clinical applicationsinclude the evaluation of the normal process of myelination in childhoodand the various white matter diseases, including disorders of demyelinationand dysmyelination.</TEXT></DOC>
