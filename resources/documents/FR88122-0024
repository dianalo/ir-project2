The Pension Protection Act, a part ofthe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, amends Title IV of the EmployeeRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 in several significant respects.These amendments apply generally to plan terminations for which noticesof intent to terminate are issued after December 17, 1987. The effect ofthis new notice is to advise contributing sponsors of their new obligationswith respect to terminating single-employer plans and to advise plan administratorsof changes in the termination procedures effected by these new rules.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>December 18, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,Coverage and Inquiries Branch, IOD, Code 25410, 2020 K Street NW., Washington,DC 20006; or call 202-778-8820 or, for TTY and TDD only, 202-778-8859 (theseare not toll-free numbers).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Actof 1987, Pub. L. 100-203, includes the Pension Protection Act (``PPA''),which amends the pension plan funding and termination, as well as othermiscellaneous provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Actof 1974, as amended (``ERISA''). This notice describes the amendments tothe plan termination rules in Title IV of ERISA and is intended to alertinterested persons to the changes in the law. The new termination rulesapply (with one exception discussed below) to voluntary terminations forwhich a notice of intent to terminate is issued to affected parties (pursuantto ERISA section 4041(a)(2)) after December 17, 1987, and to involuntaryterminations initiated by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'')under section 4042 after that date. Plan administrators initiating standardor distress terminations on or after the effective date of the amendmentsshould still, in general, follow the rules and procedures set forth inthe PBGC's Notice of Interim Procedures (51 FR 12491 (April 10, 1986)).(The PBGC's new termination regulations, issued in proposed form for publiccomment on September 2, 1987 (52 FR 33318), are not yet in effect. Whenthe final regulations are issued, they will reflect the PPA amendmentsdiscussed herein.) Those rules and procedures that are modified by thePPA are discussed below. This notice does not address all of the TitleIV amendments in the PPA; nor is it intended as an exhaustive discussionof the plan termination amendments. Pension plan practitioners should familiarizethemselves with the PPA. (Statutory citations below are to sections ofthe Budget Reconciliation Act, except where otherwise noted.)<ITAG tagnum="84">Standard Terminations</ITAG>The major change in the law with respect to standard terminations is theincrease in plan benefits that must be paid in order for a plan to terminatein a standard termination. The prior rule that a plan be able to dischargeall benefit commitments under the plan has been replaced by the requirementthat a plan pay all ``benefit liabilities'' under the plan (in section9313(a)). The term ``benefit liabilities'' is synonymous with pre-PPA terminationliability and includes all fixed and contingent liabilities to plan participantsand beneficiaries, including liability for benefits in effect on the dateof termination that are not protected under section 411(d)(6) of the InternalRevenue Code of 1986 or section 204(g) of ERISA. (Conference Report onH.R. 3545, Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, H.R. Rep. No. 100-495, 100thCong., 1st Sess.) Therefore, in order to terminate in a standard termination,a plan will have to purchase irrevocable commitments that preserve allbenefits and benefit forms in effect on the date of termination or paylump sum benefits that include the value (as of the distribution date)of all such benefits.In order to reflect this change, the notice to participants and beneficiariesof the benefits they will receive on plan termination, referred to underprior law as the ``notice of benefit commitments'' (ERISA section 4041(b)(2)(B)),should now be referred to as the ``notice of plan benefits'' and shouldinclude a statement of the participant's (or beneficiary's) full benefitunder the plan. The other information required in the notice (e.g., thespecific data used to compute a person's benefit) must still be provided.The information filed with the PBGC pursuant to ERISA section 4041(b)(2)(A)and the Notice of Interim Procedures must also be modified slightly. The``Enrolled Actuary Certification'' (PBGC Form 444) must now include theactuarial present value of all benefit liabilities (rather than benefitcommitments) (see item 1A) and a statement that the plan is projected tobe sufficient for all benefit liabilities as of the proposed distributiondate. The enrolled actuary should make these changes in ink on the form;the form should <T3>not</T3> be re-typed. Finally, as part of the notice to PBGC, the planadministrator must state the date on which the section 4041(b)(2)(B) noticesof plan benefits were issued. (The PBGC is in the process of revising thetermination forms, i.e., Forms 444 and 445 and the PBGC portion of Form5310. They will be combined into a single PBGC termination form that PBGChopes to issue at the same time as the final termination regulations.)The PPA also makes important changes in ERISA section 4044(d), which dealswith the distribution of so-called ``excess'' or ``residual'' assets uponplan termination. (It should be noted that the PPA does not change theJoint Implementation Guidelines issued by the PBGC, Treasury Departmentand Department of Labor on May 24, 1984.) Under section 9311(a), a planamendment to permit an employer to recover the residual assets left aftersatisfaction of all plan benefit liabilities or to increase the amountof such assets that may be distributed to the employer may not be effectivebefore the end of the fifth calendar year following the adoption date ofthe amendment. Any such amendment adopted on or before December 17, 1987is not subject to this rule. A plan that has contained an employer reversionprovision since the effective date of the plan is also excluded from this5-year rule, even if the plan was not in effect on December 17, 1987. If,as of December 17, 1987, a plan has no provision relating to the distributionof residual assets to the employer, any such amendment adopted prior toDecember 18, 1988 will also be excluded from the 5-year rule; amendmentsto such plans adopted after December 17, 1988 will be subject to the rule.In light of these new rules, for terminations that will involve a reversionto the employer, the plan administrator must state in the standard terminationnotice to the PBGC that the plan contains a provision permitting a reversionto the employer and give the adoption date of the provision.A second change to ERISA section 4044(d) concerns the method used in acontributory plan for computing the portion of the excess assets that isattributable to mandatory employee contributions. That portion of the residualassets must be distributed to participants and their beneficiaries in everycase (ERISA section 4044(d)(3), as amended). Under the PPA, the ``presumptivemethod'' for calculating this amount in the PBGC's allocation of assetsregulation (29 CFR 2618.31(b)) is made the mandatory method for all cases,with one modification relating to the definition of participants. Thisrule applies to terminations for which notices of intent to terminate areissued after December 17, 1987.Under the rule in andSection; 2618.31(b), ``participants'' for purposes ofthis calculation are all individuals who are plan participants on the dateof plan termination. Under andSection; 2618.31(a), the persons who sharein this portion of the residual assets are those entitled to benefits underpriority category 2 (ERISA section 4044(a)(2)), determined as of the assetdistribution date (andSection; 2618.2). Under the rule as codified in amendedERISA section 4044(d)(3), the same group of participants is used for bothpurposes and ``participant'' is defined to include both an individual whois a participant on the date of termination and an individual who, withinthe 3-year period ending on the termination date, received a distributionfrom the plan of his entire nonforfeitable benefit either in the form ofa lump sum distribution (paid to the individual or to another plan on theindividual's behalf) or as an irrevocable commitment purchased from aninsurer to provide such nonforfeitable benefit (section 9311(b)(2)). Thoseindividuals who had been previously cashed out are included in the computationunder amended ERISA section 4044(d)(3) by adding to the numerator of thefraction (amended section 4044(d)(3)(B)(ii)(I)) each such person's accumulatedmandatory employee contributions with interest to the date of the distributionto the individual, and by adding to the denominator (amended section 4044(d)(3)(B)(ii)(II))the amount of the lump sum or the cost of the insurance contract distributedto the individual.As under prior law, the portion of the excess assets attributable to employeecontributions is to be ``equitably distributed'' among the participants.Plan administrators should continue to use the rule in andSection; 2618.32(b)(ignoring the reference to an allocation method under andSection; 2618.31(c)(3))for this purpose.For plans that are subject to this new rule, item 5 on the Enrolled ActuaryCertification and item 1.C. on the Plan Administrator Certification areno longer appropriate as written. Therefore, item 1.C. should be deleted,and the enrolled actuary should strike the words ``PBGC regulations, 29CFR 2618.31(b)'' in item 5 and insert in their place ``amended ERISA section4044(d)(3).'' As mentioned before, changes on the forms should be madein ink; the forms should not be re-typed.Plan administrators should note one final change with respect to standardterminations (and, if applicable, distress terminations as well): For plansdescribed in section 412(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the EnrolledActuary Certification is no longer required (section 9314(a)).<ITAG tagnum="84">Distress Terminations</ITAG>Consistent with the new requirement for standard terminations that allplan benefit liabilities be satisfied, a contributing sponsor that terminatesa plan in a distress termination is now liable (along with the membersof its controlled group) for all unfunded benefit liabilities (section9312(b)(2) amending ERISA section 4062(b)(1)(A)). (In a technical change,the 30-percent of net worth limitation has been moved from section 4062(b)to section 4068; under the new employer liability rules, the net worthlimitation is relevant only for determining the amount subject to PBGC'sstatutory lien and the status of PBGC's claim in bankruptcy.)In addition, the full employer liability now runs solely to the PBGC. Theexisting mechanism for collecting and paying employer liability to planparticipants and beneficiaries introduced by the Single-Employer PensionPlan Amendments Act of 1986 (``SEPPAA''), the section 4049 trust, has beenrepealed (section 9312(a)). In the future, the PBGC will pay participantsand beneficiaries a portion of their outstanding benefit liabilities (i.e.,unfunded benefit liabilities that are not guaranteed benefits) from thePBGC's employer liability recovery. The amounts paid by the PBGC will bebased on a ``recovery ratio'', which is, in general, the ratio of the valueof an employer liability recovery to the total employer liability claimfor unfunded benefit liabilties. (After a transition period, this ratiowill be determined from the data for prior plan terminations, except forlarge cases where the actual ratio for the particular termination willbe used.) The amounts paid to participants and beneficiaries will be allocatedin accordance with ERISA section 4044(a). These rules apply to distressterminations for which the notices of intent to terminate are issued afterDecember 17, 1987 and to involuntary terminations under ERISA section 4042initiated by the PBGC after that date.The PPA also effects several changes to the distress termination testsin ERISA section 4041(c)(2)(B) (section 9313(b)). As amended, the liquidationtest (clause (i)) now includes proceedings that were commenced as reorganizationproceedings and subsequently converted to liquidation proceedings. Boththe liquidation and reorganization tests now require that a person seekingto qualify under either test be in the proceeding as of the <T3>proposed</T3> termination date. Persons seeking to qualify under thereorganization test must give the PBGC advance written notice that theperson intends to ask the bankruptcy (or other appropriate) court to approvethe plan termination; the notice must include a copy of the request. Finally,in order to approve a termination under the reorganization distress test,the court must make a determination that ``unless the plan is terminated,such person will be unable to pay all its debts pursuant to a plan of reorganizationand will be unable to continue in business outside the chapter 11 reorganizationprocess.'' The addition of this standard for approval of a terminationshould provide useful guidance to contributing sponsors seeking distressterminations and to the bankruptcy courts and foster consistent applicationof the second distress test. These amendments have the same effective dateas the others.One final change for distress terminations is that every member of thecontributing sponsor's controlled group must now meet one of the criteriafor distress; the SEPPAA rule that only ``substantial''; members of thecontrolled group had to satisfy one of the distress criteria has been repealed.This amendment, too, has the same effective date.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, the 19th day of January, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Kathleen P.
