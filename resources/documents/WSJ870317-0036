The amount, which was determined yesterday, represents the difference between collateral securing loans from the Dallas bank to troubled thrifts in the Southwest and the total of those loans. The loans are FSLIC-guaranteed. The transaction will leave the FSLIC with only about $1.5 billion in cash on hand.    The Dallas bank requested the funds last Thursday to make good on FSLIC guarantees on loans made by the bank to struggling savings and loan institutions. Earlier this month, government auditors declared the FSLIC insolvent, and auditors examining the Dallas bank's 1986 financial statement warned they could issue a qualified opinion unless the bank obtained funds for the guarantees.    A qualified opinion would hurt the entire Federal Home Loan Bank system's ability to raise capital by selling bonds. The Dallas bank is one of 12 regional Federal Home Loan banks that are owned by member savings and loans. </TEXT></DOC>
