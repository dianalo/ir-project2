The unusual amalgamation of enemy gear is now undergoing itsfirst operational test at Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M., thePentagon announced Tuesday.   Known formally as the Mobile Integrated Threat Test, the setupreplicates ``a key slice of a Soviet Army headquarters and divisionorganization'' and uses real enemy equipment obtained through avariety of means, officials said.   Most of the equipment is electronic _ primarily radar and radiogear. But MiG jet fighters also will be used in simulating the``threat force,'' the Pentagon added in a statement.   The U.S. military has long conducted tests and experiments withpieces of military equipment made in the Soviet Union, Warsaw Pactand Third World countries and then captured, stolen or covertlypurchased.   What makes the new effort different is an attempt to combine theradar, radios and targeting equipment into the type of``integrated'' system that U.S. forces would face on a battlefield.   Also setting the work apart is the creation of a smallorganization known as the Defense Test and Evaluation SupportAgency that is responsible for operating the gear and playing theenemy.   ``We're not re-inventing the wheel; bits and portions of thishave been done in the past,'' said James Wilson, the director ofthe Mobile Integrated Threat Test.   ``What we're going to offer is the ability to deliver, set upand operate this (enemy) gear for testing U.S. systems. We'retrying ... to come close to the real thing. The gear we have is notstate-of-the-art, but it's still in use within the Warsaw Pact.''   The tests now under way at Kirtland are designed to demonstratethat a relatively large network of Soviet equipment can be operatedjust like the Russians would handle it. Once that goal isaccomplished, the support agency will respond to requests from themilitary services for assistance in checking out the effectivenessof various types of American equipment.   The Kirtland tests, which will run to early October, willinclude some flights by Soviet aircraft ``simulating close-airsupport missions'' as well as flights by New Mexico Air NationalGuard A-7 attack jets.   The A-7s will be used ``to test the capabilities of the Sovietsensors,'' the Pentagon statement said.   ``But this is not a traveling road show,'' Wilson said. ``Therewon't be any dogfights or anything like that. We don't want tooversell what we're doing.''</TEXT></DOC>
