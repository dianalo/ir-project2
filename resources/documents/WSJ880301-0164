The market in these so-called deposit notes, which didn't exist before 1985, has mushroomed to almost $20 billion in less than two years and by year end could reach $30 billion, or 30% of all banking company bonds and notes expected to be issued this year, many analysts say.    &quot;The growth is explosive,&quot; says Allerton G. Smith, a vice president at First Boston Corp. And the growth runs parallel to increasing investor skittishness about bank holding companies with mountains of bad debts to developing countries.    In contrast with holding company bonds and notes, bank deposit notes are exempt from Securities and Exchange Commission registration requirements because they are considered bank liabilities. As a result, the notes appear on the issuing bank's balance sheet as deposits and are mostly eligible for federal insurance to $100,000 for each account holder. In addition, the notes aren't subject to bank reserve requirements when the original term of the securities is 18 months or longer. Maturities typically are two to five years.    The lack of disclosure on deposit note offerings is another lure for bank borrowers. &quot;This is a sensitive industry,&quot; says Bruce A. Crystal, a principal at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. &quot;The less publicity the better.&quot; Even triple-A-rated foreign banks &quot;find deposit notes a very palatable financing alternative because of (the banks') reluctance to abide by stronger U.S. disclosure standards,&quot; says Donald E. Noe, an associate director at Moody's Investors Service Inc.    In many cases, deposit notes -- which share many of the characteristics of conventional corporate bonds -- are supplanting bank holding company notes among large institutional investors, says Emanuel J. Falzon, president of Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc., one of the largest dealers in the notes. &quot;Safety, liquidity and yield, the three things investors always demand, have caused many buyers of corporate (bank) debt to shift into these instruments,&quot; he adds. The market in deposit notes, however, remains &quot;less liquid than standard corporate bonds and notes,&quot; says Mr. Noe.    For many banks, deposit notes are an even cheaper way to raise money than taking in deposits. Having avoided reserve requirements by issuing the notes, banks take another step to cut costs. They typically swap the proceeds from deposit notes with other financial institutions for shorter-term cash obligations, which currently carry lower interest rates.    Growing investor preference for the notes stems partly from a recognition by credit rating concerns that regulators will protect troubled banks and their creditors while permitting the holding companies to suffer. Investors got the first big indication of this trend in 1986 when regulators bailed out the bank subsidiaries of First Oklahoma Bancorp. and BancOklahoma Corp. while leaving the creditors and stockholders of the holding companies unprotected. The bailout of Continental Illinois Corp. in 1984 protected stockholders as well as depositors.    These precedents prompted Moody's and, more recently, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., to distinguish between bank and bank holding company debt in their ratings. &quot;A bank is a better credit than a holding company of the same institution because the bank is the location of earnings and assets of the holding company,&quot; says Christopher T. Mahoney, an associate director at Moody's. &quot;A holding company's claims are subordinate to those of a depositor.&quot;    As a result, ratings on many bank holding company securities now are lower than their subsidiaries' deposit notes. Sandamp;P, for example, recently downgraded Chemical New York Corp. to single-A from double-A, but reduced its rating on Chemical Bank to single-A-plus from double-A.    Partly in response to these rating changes, traders are driving up yields on bank holding company debt relative to Treasury securities while lowering the corresponding spread over Treasurys on bank notes. For instance, current yields on double-A-rated bank deposit notes are as much as 0.1 percentage point less than similar-rated and similar-maturing bank holding company debt; for single-A-rated concerns, the yield gap is as much as 0.15 percentage point in favor of deposit notes, according to data compiled by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. On a $100 million transaction, this gap would amount to a minimum of $50,000, the firm's traders say.    &quot;The volume of bank deposit notes is bound to increase now that banks are perceived as better credit risks&quot; than their holding companies, says Robin Monro-Davies, managing director of London-based IBCA Banking Analysis Ltd. &quot;There's no question the major U.S. money banking companies now are regarded as among the weakest in the world.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
