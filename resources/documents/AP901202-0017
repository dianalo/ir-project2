The polls opened under dreary skies with snow and light rain.About 60 million people were eligible to choose the government forthe newly united nation, but initial reports said turnout was low.   Germany's leaders were among the first to vote.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl cast his ballot at noon in his hometownof Oggersheim, 65 miles south of Frankfurt after attending church.Kohl and his Christian Democrats are widely favored to win becauseof his strong leadership in uniting the two Germanys.   His main challenger, leftist Social Democrat Oskar Lafontaine,voted in Saarbruecken in southwestern Germany, the capital ofSaarland state where he serves as governor.   Kohl said Germans had paid a high price for democracy and urgedthem to vote.   ``Many people fought peacefully for the right to vote freely fordecades. They often suffered prison or worse. This right is one ofdemocracy's most precious treasures,'' Kohl said in an interviewpublished Sunday.   The first projected results were expected at 6:30 p.m. (12:30p.m. EST), 30 minutes after the polls close.   The momentous occasion was overshadowed Saturday by disclosurethat an arrest warrant had been issued for former East GermanCommunist chief Erich Honecker on charges he gave shoot-to-killorders at the Berlin Wall.   Honecker, 78, is accused of personally giving shoot-to-killorders at the Berlin Wall, a city justice official said. He saidthe warrant links Honecker directly to the deaths of several peopletrying to escape East Germany.   Honecker ruled East Germany for 18 years until a peacefulrevolution in October 1989 swept him from power. The events led tothe unification of Germany on Oct. 3.   Sunday's vote puts the final democratic seal on the yearlongdrama of German unity that abolished the one-party state of EastGermany and merged it with democratic West Germany.   Twelve million former East Germans were joining 48 millionformer West Germans at the polls. Together, they were electing anew 656-member Parliament and the first chancellor of reunitedGermany.   Germany last voted freely as one nation in November 1932. Twomonths later, Adolf Hitler was named chancellor and soon rammedthrough laws depriving non-Nazis of their seats in parliament.   The disastrous defeat in World War II left Germany divided.   Kohl, who as chancellor guided West Germany to unity with itseastern neighbor, automatically became the leader of all Germanywhen the two states merged.   A poll by the respected Allensbach Institute published Saturdaypredicted Kohl's Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sisterparty, the Christian Socialists, would earn 42.5 percent of thevote.   Kohl's junior coalition partner, the Free Democrats, bolsteredby the growing popularity of their leader, Foreign MinisterHans-Dietrich Genscher, were likely to receive 10 percent, the pollsaid.   The opposition Social Democrats, still trying to recover fromtheir early resistance to quick unification, were expected toreceive no better than 34.5 percent of the vote, the Allensbachpoll indicated. No margin of error was given.   Confident that voters will confirm the course he steered tounity, Kohl made only one-fourth as many campaign appearances asLafontaine, his Social Democratic challenger.   Voters apparently will not erase communism from Germany'spolitical scene. The Party for Democratic Socialism, thereform-minded successor to East Germany's former Communist Party,is expected to win seats in the new Parliament, acccording to theAllensbach poll.   Party leader Gregor Gysi told his supporters that every vote forhis group was a vote to uphold socialist ideals. His commentsappeared in a front-page editorial in Neues Deutschland, the partynewspaper.</TEXT></DOC>
