Duffy, a former Securities and Exchange Commission regionaldirector in New York, was one of more than 200 state regulators,government prosecutors and investment executives attending a NorthAmerican Securities Administrators Association conference on theimpact of white-collar crime on public policy.   Duffy and others called for greater self-policing by securitiesand commodities firms to help prevent fraud.   Under its landmark settlement of fraud and insider tradingcharges with the SEC earlier this month, Drexel pledged to boostits internal compliance measures and agreed to tight SEC monitoringfor three years.   Securities regulators said implementation of the deal was beingclosely watched for indications whether it prompts other firms totoughen internal compliance measures as a deterrent tomarket-related crime.   ``Drexel will be an example for other companies who don't wantto be the next one,'' said Susan Bryant, securities administratorfor Oklahoma, who heads a panel preparing action by that stateagainst Drexel.   She said amendments Congress approved last year to the 1934Securities and Exchange Act also should put pressure on individualfirms. Brokerages now can be held liable for failing to enforcetheir own internal control procedures.   ``I think things like the Drexel settlement are just thebeginning,'' Bryant said. ``I think regulators are going to belooking at these procedures to see if it works.''   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of two House subcommitteesexamining securities law reform, said Congress likely would bepressed this term to boost SEC funding and allow the commission tofine individuals up to $100,000 per violation and institutions upto $500,000 for securities law violations.   ``They don't have the resources to deal with two major cases atonce without the rest of the agency's caseload being altered,'' hesaid.   Wyden wouldn't characterize Drexel's SEC deal and its $650million plea settlement with the Manhattan U.S. attorney's officesas inadequate, but said:   ``Certainly the sum of money is very large by anybody'spocketbook calculation. But as incredible as it seems, it's aboutin the ballpark of what Michael Milken makes in one year.''   Milken is the former Drexel junk bond financier who was named inthe SEC suit against Drexel and later charged in a separate98-count racketeering and fraud indictment. The government claimshe made more than $1 billion in four years, including $550 millionin 1987.   Hardwick Simmons, vice chairman of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,a major Wall Street brokerage house, said the industry alreadyspends $300 million annually on self-regulation and routinelycooperates with authorities.   ``That doesn't mean we're going to catch all those who abuseothers and the system,'' he said. ``It does mean we'll doeverything we can to prevent it.''   Duffy, a judge in the Southern District of New York, where themajor Wall Street securities fraud cases are being tried, said thecase of broker Dennis Levine _ whose revelations led prosecutors tonotorious insider trader Ivan Boesky _ was ``tied up with a bow anddelivered to the SEC'' because of internal compliance by Levine'sfirm.</TEXT></DOC>
