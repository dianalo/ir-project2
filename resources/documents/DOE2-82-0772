Only then can effective design methods be disseminated throughoutthe industry and product development be properly directed. A sciencedevelops around realistic appreciations of the problems to be solved.The 'roof strata tilt' conceptual model is used as a basis for pack specification,and arch and strut design are investigated using finite element modelling.A method of monolithic pack reinforcement is described and its applicationin the partitioning of a wide drivage proposed. The 'triple foundation'conceptual model is proposed as a basis for understanding powered supportspecifications and a related geotechnical appraisal technique is described.Finally, a method of providing management with a continuous indicationof the effectiveness of their powered support installations is presented.The paper concludes that improved design methods frequently require advancedcomputational techniques. The relevance of these techniques should bejudged by examining the validity of the conceptual models upon whichthey are based and the credibility of the output. 13 refs., 6 figs.,3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
