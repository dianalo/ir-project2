Tax conferees negotiated last week to reduce the sting of the tax boosts contained in the bill, which also includes spending cuts. As tax bills go, &quot;Congress has done it in about as painless a way&quot; as possible for business, said John Chapoton, a Washington attorney and the Treasury's former top tax official. He noted that generous exemptions quelled much of the opposition to the bill.    But defense contractors, large manufacturers, homebuilders, corporate raiders and wealthy estates are sure to feel the tax increase. Some home-equity borrowers and owners of small businesses and real estate, on the other hand, will be better off than under the 1986 tax-overhaul law.    As called for by the deficit-reduction accord between the White House and Congressional leaders, the legislation would raise $9 billion in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, and $14 billion in the next fiscal year.    Here are the major tax provisions as agreed to by the tax conferees:    Defense contractors. Long-term contractors -- mostly in the defense industry -- would be allowed to defer only half the amount of income on which they can now defer taxes. The tax bill would permit contractors to use the completed-contract method of accounting to defer only 30% of their income. Currently, they can use this tax-deferral technique on 60% of their income from long-term contracts. This provision would raise about $1.2 billion in revenues over two years.    Installment sales. The legislation would end the installment-sales method of accounting, by which large manufacturers, homebuilders and auto makers can defer taxes on sales made on credit until they actually receive payment. Last year's tax law partially disallowed the technique.    However, the new bill would totally restore the installment-sales method for &quot;casual&quot; sellers, such as individuals selling real estate or small businesses. The net revenue gain from the two components is $4.4 billion over two years.    Corporate raiders. A 50% non-deductible excise tax would be imposed on the &quot;greenmail&quot; gain from stock that is sold back to companies subjected to hostile tender offers. The tax would apply only to raiders who are able to sell the stock at terms more favorable than those available to other shareholders.    Bowing to pressure from Wall Street, conferees dropped controversial measures that would have slowed corporate takeover activity.    Estate taxes. The conferees agreed to freeze the existing estate tax rate at 55% for five years. It was scheduled to fall to 50% next year. The bill would also narrow an estate-tax loophole created in the 1986 tax law. The loophole allowed an estate to escape taxation by selling stock to an employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP, and then deducting half the proceeds from the taxable value of the estate.    Interest deductions. The legislation would forbid interest deductions on home-equity loan amounts exceeding $100,000. However, the provision would allow borrowers to use all of their loan money for any purpose and still qualify for interest deductions up to that limit. Currently, borrowers can't qualify for interest deductions on loan amounts exceeding the purchase price of the home plus improvements unless they use the money for specified purposes such as education or medical expenses.    The tax bill would cap the amount of mortgage debt eligible for interest deductions at $1 million, which could include second homes, boats, and mobile homes.    Vacation pay. Employers can take deductions for vacation pay only when it is paid, rather than a year before it's paid, as is currently allowed. This would raise $1.5 billion over two years.    Corporate estimated taxes. The tax bill would make corporations' estimated tax payments more current by bringing their schedule of payments more in line with those of individuals. This speed-up in tax payments would raise $800 million this fiscal year.    Professional corporations. Taxes would go up for corporations consisting of lawyers, doctors, accountants and architects. The provision would eliminate graduated rates for these personal-service corporations, so that they all would pay the flat 34% corporate rate.    Telephone tax. The bill would extend the existing 3% telephone tax for three years. The phone tax, which was scheduled to expire at year's end, is expected to raise $3.59 billion in two years.    Mirror subsidies. The legislation would prevent corporations from escaping taxes when they dispose of the assets of another company they acquire. Currently, companies can avoid taxation by placing the unwanted assets in subsidiaries that &quot;mirror&quot; the structure of the unwanted unit, and then liquidating these subsidiaries.    Master limited partnerships. The bill would tax as corporations these publicly traded partnerships that hold operating rather than passive businesses.    Vaccine tax. An excise tax, of as much as several dollars, would be imposed on all childhood vaccines to raise funds for a federal program to compensate children who become ill from such injections. </TEXT></DOC>
