The Liberation Front and another guerrilla faction reportedlyhave received several hundred armor-piercing, anti-tank rockets inthe past few months.   The weapons were used in the recent offensive in northwesternCambodia, in which guerrillas seized several key towns and a numberof government military positions, according to Western diplomatsand guerrilla sources interviewed last week.   The Liberation Front and a group loyal to Prince NorodomSihanouk are loosely allied with the Communist Khmer Rouge in a waragainst Cambodia's Vietnam-supported government, which wasinstalled after Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and oustedthe Khmer Rouge from power.   The newly acquired weapons are the West German 67mm Armbrust,the 84mm Swedish Carl Gustav, and the 89mm French LRAC, say thediplomats and resistance sources.   Both the Armbrust and the Gustav came to the two non-Communistfactions through Singapore, while the French weapons provided onlyto the Sihanouk group came as part of a larger package of weaponsfrom France earlier this year, according to the sources.   France has denied shipping weapons to the resistance.   ``We receive many weapons ... we don't know where they come fromor who pays for them. I don't know and I don't want to know,'' saidDr. Abdul Gaffar, the Liberation Front's senior military analyst.   Senior resistance sources, who requested anonymity, said theystrongly pressured the United States and key Asian supporters tohelp them acquire the weapons. More recently the resistance arguedthe weapons would be vital to an offensive planned to beginimmediately after last month's pullout of Vietnamese forces fromCambodia.   Supplied mostly by China, the guerrillas have previously beenlimited to light weapons. Government forces are supplied by theSoviet Union with tanks, heavy artillery and a small fleet offighter planes and assault helicopters.   Guerrillas claim to have destroyed more than 10 tanks, armoredpersonnel carriers and heavy trucks in the first two weeks ofOctober, more than twice the number they knocked out in thedecade-long war.   The anti-tank missiles were first deployed in the offensive thatbegan only four days after Vietnam said it withdrew its last troopsfrom Cambodia on Sept. 26.   The resistance was unable to hold significant territory untilthis month.   ``This will do for us what the Stingers did for Afghanistan,''Dien Del said.   U.S. Stinger anti-aircraft missiles sent to the guerrillas inAfganistan are widely believed to have turned the tide in favor ofthe resistance several years ago.   Bangkok-based diplomats say requests for weaponry and suppliesgo through the Cambodian Working Group, composed of representativesfrom the United States, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. TheBangkok-based group reviews battle plans before approving weaponsrequests.   The United States pays the cost of some anti-tank weaponstraining, reliable sources say.   Washington denies providing lethal aid to the resistance but alegal aid program exists that could include non-lethal militaryassistance.   On a recent tour by The Associated Press of territory capturedby the resistance, several Soviet tanks and heavy transport truckswere seen destroyed near the key towns of Thmar Pouk, BanteayChmar, and Kandoul in the northwestern Cambodian province ofBattambang.   ``It is absolutely essential that we continue to have anti-tankweapons,'' Abdul Gaffar said. ``If we ran out of anti-tank weaponstommorow, the day after tommorow the Phnom Penh tanks would rollover our positions.''</TEXT></DOC>
