The dollar's sudden tumble followed the realignment early yesterday of currencies in the European Monetary System, a joint float of eight Common Market currencies. All last week, speculation about the realignment diverted attention from the sluggish American economy and record U.S. trade deficit, which have undercut the dollar's strength for months.    Traders said the West German and Japanese central banks intervened in currency markets yesterday to buy dollars in efforts to avert or slow the U.S. unit's decline. In early Tokyo trading Tuesday, the Bank of Japan intervened again, dealers said.    The dollar's drop yesterday &quot;is a continuation of a trend&quot; begun about 22 months ago, said Carmine Rotondo, vice president and chief corporate dealer at Security Pacific National Bank, New York. &quot;People are very bearish about the dollar and there's nothing out there to change their minds,&quot; he said, expressing a view prevalent among foreign-exchange traders.    &quot;With the EMS realignment over, the market went back to monitoring the factors that we were watching before: the U.S. economy and trade difficulties,&quot; said Valerie J. Walker, head of Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank's New York foreign-exchange advisory office. &quot;The EMS realignment was a brief interlude, but the market's underlying bearish tone hasn't changed any&quot; toward the dollar, she said.    Traders said the stock market's recent rally hasn't lent much strength to the dollar. The force fueling much of the rise in stock prices is also cited as contributing to the dollar's weakness: expectations of lower U.S. interest rates.    &quot;People are still looking for another cut in the (U.S.) discount rate,&quot; said Ronald L. Sapiro, vice president and chief dealer at Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co., Chicago, referring to the Federal Reserve's lending fee to banks. Lower interest rates would make dollar-denominated investments relatively less attractive, decreasing demand for the currency.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8970 West German marks, down 1.1% from 1.9180 Friday. The dollar fell 1.2% to 1.5865 Swiss francs, from 1.6053, and 0.6% to 157.42 Japanese yen, from 158.33.    The British pound climbed 0.7% to $1.4867, from $1.4765.    In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday the dollar fell against the Japanese currency to 157.30 yen from 157.42 in New York yesterday afternoon.    Another cause of the dollar's latest slide is speculation that further adjustments will be needed within the EMS. In the latest realignment, the mark's value was increased by 3%. Because that was less than many traders expected, some believe another realignment soon will be necessary, lifting the mark still higher. That sentiment encourages speculative buying of the mark, in some cases with dollars.    In Europe yesterday, the German central bank bought between $200 million and $300 million with marks in an effort apparently aimed at slowing the dollar's decline, traders said. At the Frankfurt foreign-exchange fixing, the German central bank bought $26.4 million.    And in Tokyo trading yesterday, the Bank of Japan supported the dollar with limited purchases, traders said.    &quot;The only thing that might help the dollar down the road is the (December) retail sales number Wednesday,&quot; said Mr. Rotondo of Security Pacific National Bank, referring to the Commerce Department report. Analysts expect a rise in sales of about 2.5%.    But many currency traders said they would be skeptical of any strong increase in the sales figure. They noted that consumers may have stepped up their purchases last month in order to be able to deduct the sales tax on their 1986 tax returns. Beginning this year, sales taxes can't be deducted.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery climbed $2.70 an ounce to $408.70 in brisk trading. The estimated volume was 4.2 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $409.35 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                       CURRENCY RATES                         New York   Home Mkt.
