Lukman said oil prices have surged higher than expected thisyear, but he cautioned it was not clear the gains would bepermanent.   ``We have yet to ascertain whether they form part of a long-termupward trend in pricing levels or whether they merely constitute ashort- or medium-term cyclical peak,'' he said. ``We therefore urgecaution against complacency, at this stage, for these gains haveyet to be consolidated.''   Lukman called on the producing nations to hold their outputlevels to the quotas set by the cartel.   Potential problems, he said, could come from increasedproduction in areas recently slowed by accidents, such as in theNorth Sea. He also said a pickup in inflation could lead to acontraction in industrialized economies.   Earlier in the day, officials said ministers from Nigeria,Venezuela, Indonesia and Algeria met to consider the options aftera compromise failed to win Kuwaiti backing.   ``There's no deadlock,'' insisted Iraqi Oil Minister Issam AbdulRaheem al-Chalabi.   The cartel is trying to reach a quick agreement on a new pricingand production accord, in part to let Iran's oil minister,Gholamreza Aqazadeh, return home for the funeral of AyatollahRuhollah Khomeini.   The ministers seem in general agreement on lifting theirJuly-December production ceiling to 20 million barrels a day, anincrease of 1.5 million barrels from the current accord.   An increase along those lines, analysts say, would likely leaveoil prices _ and gasoline prices at the pump _ unchanged.   An official of one delegation, who demanded anonymity, said theelements of a compromise emerged over the weekend. Under this plan,the output cap would be lifted to 20 million barrels a day.   Of that sum, 500,000 would be divided up among five countries _Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Gabon, Ecuador and Qatar. Thosecountries have been pressing for higher quotas, or shares of theoverall total.   The additional one million barrels would be sharedproportionately among all 13.   The official said, however, Kuwait has insisted on a stillhigher chunk of the total.   Kuwait's oil minister, Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, reportedly wants toboost his current quota from 1.037 million barrels a day to as muchas 1.35 million barrels.   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, said he would like tosee higher crude prices, but he declined to say how much. ``Themarket decides the price,'' he said.   Nazer, the pivotal negotiator in the talks, said he expectscrude oil demand to increase ``a substantial amount'' in theremainder of the year.   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, pumps nearly aquarter of all OPEC oil, giving it powerful leverage over thenegotiations.   Some of the OPEC countries, seeking an advantage at the meeting,have turned up production in recent weeks. Total OPEC output isestimated at about 21 million barrels a day.   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEChas skyrocketed from $12.34 a barrel at the end of November tonearly $17.70 a barrel last week. West Texas Intermediate, thebenchmark U.S. crude, was trading at just under $20 a barrel.   Prices have been pushed up not only by OPEC's output cuts butalso by accidents in oil-producing areas that have reduced supply.   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United ArabEmirates and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
