Development of this rationale restsheavily on a full appreciation of the variety of biologic effects inducibleby dsRNA and the contribution of these effects to the therapeutic efficacyof these dsRNAs. Embodied in this rationale are certain principles, theapplication of which has resulted in the synthesis of analogs of polyrI . rC. These analogs can be shown to have preserved their ability totrigger beneficial effects, which being much reduced in their capacityto trigger toxic response. Conjugates of protein-dsRNA have been designedand tested, with preliminary results indicating this type of conjugatemay enhance the effectiveness and specificity of dsRNA.</TEXT></DOC>
