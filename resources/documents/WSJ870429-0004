The proposal, which could run into member opposition, also calls for increased cooperation among financial authorities to prevent the practice. It would require EC nations to outlaw insider trading but is sufficiently general to allow member states to decide how to prevent it, commission officials said.    Given the trend toward international trading, &quot;it is essential that the European investor has the same degree of protection against illegal practices on all European stock markets,&quot; the commission said in a statement. The move is one of several commission initiatives aimed at creating a common market in financial services by 1992.    The proposal defines inside information as confidential knowledge that if made public would &quot;have a significant effect on the price of a stock.&quot; It covers those who pass inside information as well as those who receive it.    The proposal says traders with inside information should be banned from profiting by selling or buying stock based on their knowledge, passing their information to a third party, and recommending that a third party buy or sell stocks based on inside information.    According to the commission, France, Britain and Denmark already have legislation against insider trading. Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands expect to introduce measures on the issue. West Germany has a series of voluntary rules under which stock traders agree not to use inside information. However, the other five EC countries -- Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal and Greece -- have no rules on the matter. </TEXT></DOC>
