Western diplomats, quoting dispatches from missions in theAfghan capital, said the airport was shrouded in ``thick black andgray smoke'' from the rocket attack.   Earlier in the day, Pakistani authorities said seven Afghanfighter-bombers struck the deepest to date into Pakistaniterritory, killing one person and injuring seven.   Diplomatic dispatches from Kabul said the rockets startedhitting the city around 2:55 p.m. at Kabul airport and``significant parts of the city.''   ``By 3:20 the fire was out of control,'' said a dispatch fromone western embassy. ``There were secondary explosions andforeigners were ordered to evacuate (the airport),'' it said.   ``Rockets have been exploding in Kabul all afternoon,'' said aU.S. diplomat on condition of anonymity. ``The force of theexplosion indicates it may have been an ammunition dump,'' he said.   In a report from Kabul, the official Soviet news agency Tasssaid ``opposition units today subjected to massive bombardment withground-to-ground rockets the Kabul international airport area. Therockets damaged depots and transport aircraft.''   The report added that several rockets exploded in residentialdistricts of Kabul, and authorities had put out the resulting fires.   Reports said it was not clear how many rockets had fallen. Therewere no immediate reports of casualties and state-run Kabul radio,in its nighttime broadcast, made no mention of the attack.   Both the Kabul attack and the bombing of villages near thePakistani frontier city of Peshawar appeared more daring anddestructive than any operations this year. Afghan insurgents beganfighting communist Afghan forces in 1978.   Pakistani sources reported Thursday that seven Soviet-builtAfghan fighter-bombers hit villages 30 miles east of the Afghanborder.   Kabul radio said four people, including children, were killedand nine others were wounded. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said oneperson was killed and seven injured, and five houses were destroyed.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakleycondemned the bombing as the ``latest and most extreme incident ofarmed intervention'' against Pakistan's territorial integrity, andsaid it violated the 4-month-old Geneva accords.   ``The United States condemns this act of aggression againstPakistan,'' Ms. Oakley said, adding that U.S. figures had oneperson killed and 18 wounded.   Ms. Oakley said it was not clear whether the planes were flownby Soviets or Afghans. She said the United States would raise theissue with the United Nations and with Soviet authorities.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasir Jamal said the attack may havebeen the worst violation of Pakistan's territory sinceAfghanistan's civil war broke out 10 years ago.   Government officials originally said five planes conducted theraid but later claimed there were seven.   Nasir said the planes flew 43 miles into the Warsak district ofnorthwest Pakistan, killing one person, injuring seven anddestroying five houses.   ``According to my knowledge, it was the deepest violation of ourterritory (so far in the war),'' Nasir said.   Cross-border shellings and bombings are frequent in the tribalareas of Pakistan's frontier, where the U.S.-backed guerrillasstage their attacks.   The raid was the first on what Pakistanis call a ``settledarea,'' dotted with villages and under full provincial control.   Omar Amir, a Pakistani journalist who visited the site, saidvillagers believed the intruding aircraft were Soviet-built MiGbombers.   Omar said 12 people were injured, all Pakistanis.   Moscow and Kabul repeatedly have accused Pakistan of violatingan accord providing for the withdrawal from Afghanistan of Soviettroops who entered in 1979 to back the government troops.   Afghan President Najib on Wednesday proposed a meeting betweenthe foreign ministers of Pakistan, the United States, the SovietUnion and Afghanistan to discuss implementation of the accord,signed April 14 in Geneva.   Tass quoted Najib as saying Thursday that since May, when theSoviets began withdrawing their troops, ``the armed opposition hasbeen imposing war on us and we, regrettably, are being drawn intoit even more actively.''   ``If war is being imposed on us, we, in turn, should impose thepolicy of reconciliation,'' he told a meeting of leaders ofAfghanistan's political parties. ``Above all, it is necessary topress for the cease-fire not only in the country as a whole, butalso in individual villages, districts and provinces.''</TEXT></DOC>
