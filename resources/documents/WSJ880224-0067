Yet here she is, surrounded by the enticing aromas of chili and meatballs at the sandwich shop where she works as quality control manager, contentedly sipping a cup of herbal tea. Ms. McPherson, who weighs 235 pounds, hasn't munched a morsel for a week, and she insists it hasn't bothered her a bit.    Ms. McPherson is one of about one million participants in America's latest diet craze -- the protein-supplemented fast. Designed to provide rapid weight loss for the obese, these expensive programs involve lengthy periods when participants are sustained solely by liquid-protein supplements and a steady diet of group therapy.    Drastic, maybe, but Americans are flocking to it and in the process, generating significant revenues for hospitals, clinics and pharmaceutical companies. At the same time, fasting programs are raising questions among diet researchers about long-term impact and spurring some abuses, while health insurers are divided over how much coverage to provide.    Generally, though, fasting is gaining acceptance in many medical quarters, which may surprise those who remember the checkered history of liquid-protein supplements. And some striking results, at least so far, have given renewed hope to the chronically obese. &quot;I've tried every diet known to man,&quot; says Donald Knop, a Fort Worth, Texas, businessman. &quot;I tried Weight Watchers, chemicals, pills, supplements.&quot; All of them failed. But at a Baylor University fasting clinic, he shed 126 of his 327 pounds in about six months.    The obsessive pursuit of the body beautiful is big business. Weight Watchers International Inc. alone claims four million followers; throw in diet books, diet foods, fat farms, videocassettes and assorted exercise devices, and the result is an industry with $10 billion in annual sales.    Hospitals, reeling from government cost-cutting efforts, increased competition and declining occupancy rates, have welcomed the fasting programs, which can produce profit margins as high as 25%. Some 950 hospitals, clinics and doctors nationwide have built programs around supplements made by the U.S. unit of Swiss-based Sandoz Ltd. and Health Management Resources, Boston, and support programs developed by dietary consultants.    These programs target the 34 million Americans who, according to the National Institutes of Health, need to lose 35 pounds or more. For such people, dieting can be a grueling, dispiriting process that can take up to two years. With fasting, weight losses average three to five pounds a week.    The supplement, a powder dissolved in noncaloric liquids, provides 400 to 800 calories daily. Moreover, the body produces chemicals called ketones during fasting that suppress appetite, hence the surprising lack of hunger pangs.    There are some side effects, such as increased sensitivity to cold, dizziness, bad breath and dry skin. And those who repeatedly cheat and then return to the fast face a serious loss of muscle mass.    But no deaths have been attributed to the supplements, unlike their predecessors, which came and went so quickly in the late 1970s. Those over-the-counter supplements contained low-quality, gelatin proteins, which weren't easily assimilated by the body and were blamed for at least 17 deaths.    The current diets provide more vitamins and minerals and are made from higher quality egg-white and milk proteins that are more easily assimilated, says Charles Walker, director of the Baylor clinic. The compounds are available only by prescription, and the fasting programs include weekly medical checkups. &quot;We haven't had any reports the new programs are risky,&quot; a Food and Drug Administration spokesman says.    And the results have been impressive. In San Diego psychiatrist Greg Nunn's Weight Control for Life program, used by several hospitals, about 80% of the participants lost 40 pounds or more and kept at least 25 of them off for at least a year. Of Baylor's 3,000 fasters, 70% lost 40 pounds and kept most of it off for 18 months. Conventional diets produce such results in only 1% to 5% of cases, Dr. Walker says.    The program's success stems largely from its group therapy regimen, diet experts say. &quot;It's the quality of the program that surrounds the diet more than the diet itself that determines the long-term benefit,&quot; says psychiatrist Kelly Brownell, co-director of the University of Pennsylvania's Obesity Research Clinic.    While fasting, and for at least six months afterward, participants meet weekly in small groups to learn how to cope with temptation and stress and feelings of inadequacy common to the overweight. When Mr. Knop was under stress at work, for example, he frequently devoured the sandwich he brought for lunch as early as 10 a.m., then ate again at lunch time. In group sessions, he learned to take a stress-relieving walk instead.    Despite early successes, doubts linger. Long-term studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of these relatively new programs, says Rita Storey, a spokeswoman for the American Dietary Association. Because the studies so far indicate success rates only after 12 to 18 months, no one is sure how long the benefits will last. &quot;There isn't total agreement in the dietary community about their role in long-term weight control,&quot; she says.    Many doctors still prefer sensible, balanced diets for most weight problems, even if they also sponsor fasting programs. &quot;I'd rather see people lose a little bit of weight than go up and down on fad diets,&quot; says David Heber, co-director of the Risk Factor Obesity Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.    Also, Dr. Heber notes, some practitioners peddle the diets along with questionable treatments like urine injections. Manufacturers say they screen clinics and doctors before supplying supplements, but some question their vigilance. &quot;Companies sell products to doctors indiscriminately,&quot; Dr. Heber says.    Fasting programs also cost plenty, about $100 a week on average. And some insurers won't reimburse anything. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. covers the cost of the initial physician's evaluation but not the cost of the programs or the supplements. The fasts are largely education and behavior modification programs, a spokesman says, which the company doesn't cover.    Other insurers, like Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., for example, do pay for the program -- though not the supplements -- as long as the treatment is recommended by a doctor. A spokeswoman says that the company views obesity as a treatable medical problem and that Aetna has always paid for medically accepted treatments of medical problems diagnosed by doctors.    But for fasters at Baylor one recent evening, the problems are psychological, not financial. For some, this is a last chance after years of failure. And instead of panaceas, Dr. Walker delivers a message of continuing struggle. After the fast, there will once again be choices to make at the dinner table; life styles must change. &quot;You won't fry anything again, ever,&quot; he says. There is a communal groan.    For now, at least the group can envision a slender future. Lisa Oliver, a computer programmer, wouldn't dine out, fearing that she couldn't place her 372 pounds on a chair. In her first week of fasting, she lost 10 pounds. &quot;I felt that my weight was the only part of my life that was out of control,&quot; she says. &quot;Now I'm getting control of that, too.&quot; Ms. McPherson, the sandwich shop employee, looks forward to a summer reunion with her mostly tall, slim siblings. &quot;I never felt like I fit in with them before,&quot; she says.    For Beverly Coben, fitting clothes was just as important as fitting in. After losing 54 pounds in three months, she rewarded herself with a new wardrobe, including a $1,200 Ungaro suit. Today, she is wearing a stylish black suit with a rhinestone-studded belt, no less. Ms. Coben wouldn't wear belts before her fast. &quot;I never expected to look this way,&quot; she says proudly.    (Revised WSJ Feb. 26, 1988)   ---                          Diet Data -   -- 22% of Americans are more than 20% overweight.   -- Americans consume 31% more fat than 80 years ago.   -- Americans have reduced their physical activity 75% since 1900.   -- A 20% reduction in weight can mean a 40% reduction in heart disease.   -- 97% who lose weight regain it within one year.
