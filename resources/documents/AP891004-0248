News reports about the so-called Datacrime virus, which isprogrammed to attack after Oct. 12, have caused widespread alarmeven though experts say the virus is rare and a relatively smallnumber of personal computers will be harmed.   ``Up until the recent press hype, our customers had notexpressed any tremendous interest over and above what we already doin terms of security products and awareness,'' said Art Gilbert,IBM's manager of secure systems industry support.   Small companies in the anti-virus field expressed support forthe step Tuesday by the world's largest computer maker.   ``It's about time one of the big boys realized what a problemthis is and did something about it. To date, all the anti-virusactivity is being done by the mom and pops out there,'' said RossGreenberg, a New York-based consultant and author of Flu-Shot Plus.   ``It's a very important and responsible step,'' said PamelaKane, president of Panda Systems in Wilmington, Del., and author ofa new book, ``Virus Protection.''   IBM said its IBM Virus Scanning Program for computers that runMicrosoft Corp.'s DOS base-layer software would spot three strainsof the Datacrime virus as well as more common viruses that go bysuch names as the Jerusalem, Lehigh, Bouncing Ball, Cascade andBrain.   The program is available for $35 directly from IBM or fromdealers, marketing representatives and remarketers. Gilbert saidthe program will detect but not eradicate viruses. Some othercompanies say they have products that will eradicate viruses,although others say such programs are not reliable.   Gilbert said installing a virus checker is not a substitute forsafe-computing practices such as making backup copies of programsand data and being cautious about software of unknown origin.   The Datacrime virus cripples personal computers' hard disks,where programs and data are stored, by wiping out the directorysections known as the partition table and file allocation table.   Experts who have dismantled copies of the virus say it is set upto attack computers when their internal calendars go past Oct. 12,the traditional date for Columbus Day.</TEXT></DOC>
