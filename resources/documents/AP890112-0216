It has even been extended.   ``All the articles that were printed concerning the head of theMossad are untrue and baseless. He has done extraordinary work. .. .He enjoys the confidence of the government and my full trust andconfidence,'' Shamir said.   Unprecedented public debate about the Mossad followed a SupremeCourt decision Tuesday overuling the military censor and allowingthe Tel Aviv weekly newspaper Ha'ir to run an article on the Mossad.   The article is to run in Friday's editions. The Associated Pressobtained an advance copy.   Ha'ir, quoting foreign newspaper reports, said the Mossad headwas responsible for events leading to the expulsion of five Israeliagents from Britain last September. In another incident, Mossadagents in West Germany left forged passports in a telephone booth,the article said.   Author Aluf Ben described the head of the Mossad as a mediocreand manipulative bureaucrat who worked his way up by outlasting moreoutstanding competitors.   The Mossad head, named in foreign reports as Nahum Adnoni, wasappointed in September 1982 as a last-minute fill-in for Gen.Yekutiel Adam, who was the first choice of then-Prime MinisterMenahem Begin but was killed in the Lebanon war, Ben wrote.   The new chief had been deputy Mossad chief and ``had spent mostof his years far from any operations and had not guided anyagents,'' Ben wrote.   His main goal as head of Mossad was to hang on to his job byavoiding mistakes, the article said. ``He didn't initiate operationsand preferred to leave the ship in port.''   He was so eager to avoid complications that he acceptedintrusions into his territory, such as the decision of then-PrimeMinister Shimon Peres in 1985-86 to enlist his personal aides ratherthan the Mossad in selling arms to Iran, the article said.   Ben said the search for a new chief began months ago. One of thetwo main contenders is from outside the agency and the other rosethrough the ranks, he wrote.   Shamir was expected to make his choice within days. Israelinewspapers said he favored the candidate within the agency, notingthat Shamir was with the Mossad in the 1950s and 1960s.   Shamir on Thursday criticized the public debate over the Mossadchief, saying: ``He and the agency he heads have been caused a greatdeal of sorrow.''</TEXT></DOC>
