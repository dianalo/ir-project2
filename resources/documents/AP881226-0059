Walid Khaled, spokesman for the Fatah-Revolutionary Council, theextremist guerrilla group headed by terrorist Abu Nidal, said thegirls _ Marie-Laure, 7, and Virginie, 6 _ were ``on their way toParis by plane and will arrive there within a few hours.'' He didnot specify the flight they were on.   The girls' father and grandmother left Beirut earlier todayaboard a Paris-bound Middle East Airlines plane after saying theywere disappointed that the girls were not freed on Christmas, asexpected.   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council said Sunday that the girls wouldbe freed as a Christmas gift to the children of the world.   The group said it was acting in response to appeals from Libyanleader Moammar Gadhafi, chief backer of the organization. But Khaledwould not specify where or when the girls would be freed, only thatit would be outside Lebanon.   ``I ask their (the girls') father to be ready with lots ofChristmas gifts to reunite with his daughters,'' Khaled told TheAssociated Press today.   He again refused to say where the two girls were released. Butthere had been widespread speculation that they would be freedeither in Libya or Algeria where Fatah-Revolutionary Council alsohas bases.   Earlier today, Khaled said the girls had been told of theirimminent release and that their mother, Jacqueline Valente, nolonger objected to this. ``They are old enough and have accepted thecoming separation. They are happy. They did not cry,'' Khaled said.   The grandmother and father of the girls said earlier today thatthey were unhappy about leaving for Paris without the girls.   ``I'm disappointed because I'm leaving without my twogranddaughters,'' said Brigitte Valente as she left a hotel for theairport.   With her in the escorted French Embassy car were Pascal Betille,the girls' father and estranged husband of French hostage JacquelineValente, as well as Ms. Valente's brother-in-law, Andre Metral.   ``I'm disappointed because I am going without my two littledarlings,'' said Betille. ``But I am carrying with me a promise thatthey are going to be released soon.''   Khaled released a new set of videotapes of the captives onSunday. On the tape, all the captives said they were well cared for.   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council declared Nov. 8, 1987 that it hadseized them aboard a French yacht off the Israeli-occupied GazaStrip and accused them of spying for Israel. However, Israeli pressreports said the yacht was hijacked off Libya, the group's main base.   The radicals did not disclose where the hostages were held butsaid the tapes were filmed Dec. 20. They did not relay any demandsof their kidnappers.   The Belgians are Fernand Houtekins, his brother Emmanuel and hiswife Godelieve and their two children, Laurent, 17, and Valerie, 16.   ``I'm pregnant and in good health. After our release, I intend tolive in another country than France to build up my future there,''Ms. Valente said on the videotape.   Ms. Valente gave birth to another girl in captivity and is due todeliver again in January, according to Khaled.   Besides those seized on the boat, 15 foreigners, including nineAmericans, are missing in Lebanon and believed held hostage bypro-Iranian fundamentalist factions. The longest held is TerryAnderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,who was abducted March 16, 1985.   Peter Winkler, 32, a Swiss working for the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross was released Dec. 16 after nearly a monthin captivity. His kidnappers reportedly wanted to trade him for aShiite Moslem hijacker, Hussein Hariri, whose trial begins inSwitzerland in February.</TEXT></DOC>
