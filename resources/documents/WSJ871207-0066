Mr. Kean said that, based on his recent conversations with Soviet, Finnish, Swedish and other state gas-industry officials, he is certain Moscow plans to extend a pipeline in Finland across that country, then southward through Sweden, hooking up with Western Europe's main gas grid.    Such an extension, Mr. Kean said, would give the Russians both a northern and southern connection to the European gas-pipeline grid, thereby increasing both the volume and reliability of gas shipments from Siberian fields. Reliability has been a problem for the Russians.    Mr. Kean's assertion is supported by Finnish government documents he obtained that show plans for part of such an extension. A Soviet expert, Ed Hewitt of the Brookings Institute in Washington, suggested that it was &quot;logical&quot; that Moscow try to extend the Finnish pipeline, which it helped build, and that the Soviets would try to do it quietly.    Though Russia sits on about 40% of the world's natural-gas reserves, a number of Western observers have believed that Norway's 1986 pact to sell $64 billion of gas to West Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands effectively scuttled Soviet plans to supply between half and three-quarters of Western Europe's gas needs, compared with about 30% at present.    The Soviets get more than two-thirds of their hard-currency earnings from oil and gas exports. Recent oil-price declines have forced the Soviets to borrow heavily from Western banks, according to Central Intelligence Agency studies, making an increase in gas exports that much more important for Moscow.    When the Norwegian pact was announced in June 1986, a senior Reagan administration official said the accord did much to calm U.S. fears about Western European reliance on Soviet gas. In 1982 President Reagan persuaded European allies to look for alternative gas sources in exchange for dropping sanctions against U.S. equipment for a Soviet pipeline.    But Sweden, Italy, Switzerland, Greece and Turkey recently have announced or privately indicated to Mr. Kean or others their intention to buy more Soviet gas.    Moreover, with their northern hookup, &quot;The Soviets will have a base for further penetration of the German, French and British markets,&quot; said Jan Vanous, who heads a think tank on East European affairs in Washington. &quot;Down the road, I expect the Soviets will be {Western Europe's} largest gas supplier.&quot;    Mr. Kean, who is also chairman of NUI Corp., the holding company for Elizabethtown Gas Co. in New Jersey, said Siberia's huge Urongoi gas district, which he visited in July, has a new district chief whose contract calls for a bonus tied to increased production. He also found that the Russians had overcome a number of technical problems and appeared on the verge of an output increase of 10% or more. </TEXT></DOC>
