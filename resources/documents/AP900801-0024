Moreover, a department analyst said Tuesday, consumers areseeing food prices rise faster than had been predicted earlier inthe year.   Prices at the farm were unchanged from June to July, the USDAsaid Tuesday. The index was 2.7 percent above a year ago, however.   Prices were higher during the month for lettuce, apples andmilk, but declines were reported for cattle, wheat and eggs, thedepartment's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminaryreport.   Most prices are mid-July averages which will be revised thismonth. For example, the latest report showed June prices dropped 2percent instead of the 1.3 percent decline indicated a month ago.   The report also showed prices farmers pay to meet expenses wereup 0.5 percent from April, when the previous estimate was made, and3.4 percent above July 1989. The ``prices paid'' index is computedquarterly.   Ralph L. Parlett Jr. of the department's Economic ResearchService said a new 1990 forecast due out this month will ``put usright back to the early 1980s'' when retail food prices wereclimbing sharply.   Earlier, the agency had forecast retail food prices wouldprobably go up 3 percent to 5 percent this year. And some haverecently talked about a rise of 4 percent to 6 percent.   According to USDA records, annual food price increases were 8.6percent in 1980 and 7.9 percent in 1981 before slowing their upwardrise in the next few years.   Parlett did not disclose the new forecast but indicated the 1990increase would probably exceed 6 percent. Food prices rose 5.8percent in 1989, the most since 1981.   ``It's obvious that 3-to-5 percent forecast is out in leftfield,'' he said. ``Beef and pork, that's what's doing it; pork,particularly.''   Recent forecasts show the net cash income of farmers in therange of $55 billion to $59 billion, compared with about $54billion in 1989. The record was $57.2 billion in 1988.   Net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have leftfrom gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cashexpenses. It includes government payments and proceeds from cropsgrown previously but sold during the year.   In another method taking into account changes in inventories,depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that1990 net farm income may be in a range of $47 billion to $51billion, compared with $49 billion last year.   Based on the preliminary figures, the July price index forlivestock and poultry dropped 1.2 percent from June but stillaveraged 8.9 percent more than a year ago. Meat animals were down1.5 percent from June but averaged 11 percent more than in June1989.   Milk prices rose 30 cents in July to an average of $14.10 perl00 pounds. That was up $1.50 from July 1989. The farm price ofmilk rose to a record $16 per hundredweight in December beforeeasing down.   Crop prices, overall, rose 1.6 percent from June but averaged4.4 percent below the year-earlier level.   Vegetable prices rose 20 percent from June but were down 14percent from a year earlier. Lettuce, tomatoes and sweet corn ledthe July increase.   Fruit prices were up 7.9 percent from June and 13 percent abovea year ago. Apples, grapefruit and peaches rose in July, whileoranges, pears and lemons were down.   Wheat prices, pressured by a bumper harvest, dropped 27 centsduring the month to $2.81 per bushel.   Feed grains declined, with corn prices down two cents from Juneto $2.61 per bushel.   The report said:   _Cattle averaged $97 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally,down from $98.10 in June but up from $94.60 in July 1989. Those areaverages for all types of cattle sold as beef.   _Hogs averaged $60.10 per 100 pounds, unchanged from June but upfrom $45.90 in July 1989.   _Corn, at $2.61 a bushel, was down from $2.63 in June but upfrom $2.47 a year earlier.   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,averaged $2.81 per bushel, compared with $3.08 in June and $3.78 ayear earlier.   _Rice averaged $7.10 per 100 pounds, compared with $7.08 in Juneand $7.45 in July 1989.   _Soybeans were $5.88 per bushel, unchanged from June but downfrom $6.83 a year earlier.   _Upland cotton was reported at 63.7 cents per pound, comparedwith 62.3 in June and 59.5 a year earlier.   _Eggs were 55.6 cents per dozen, compared with 62.7 in June and64.9 in July 1989.   _Milk was $14.10 per 100 pounds, up from $13.80 in June and theaverage of $12.60 a year ago.   _Broilers were 36.9 cents per pound, live weight, compared with34.1 cents in June and 38.7 cents a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
