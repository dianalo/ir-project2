Students staged protests at three schools in Seoul to demand theOlympics be shared with communist North Korea and to denounce thegovernment of President Roh Tae-woo. The Olympics start Saturday.   ``Oppose dictator's Olympics!'' and ``Crush militaryaggression!'' students yelled.   About 300 protesters armed with firebombs and clubs marched outof Kookmin University to fight riot police after burning effigiesof Reagan and Roh, as well as a U.S. flag. But riot police watchedfrom a distance and did not intervene as the protesters repeatedlyblocked traffic.   Students, one of whom hurled a single firebomb at a passingpolice truck and missed, tired of taunting police and dispersed.   About 500 students took part in a similar protest at SeoulNational University in the south of the capital. They marched tothe gate and burned an effigy of Roh.   Riot police in green combat fatigues and black, visored helmetswatched but did not intervene. The students made no move to attackthe police.   The protesters then marched to a gym on the campus where Olympictable tennis events are to be held and yelled anti-Olympic slogansoutside the building before dispersing.   A small anti-Olympic protest was also held at Yonsei Universitywith less than 100 students taking part.   Anti-Olympic protests have been small by Korean standards, andthe radicals have failed to attract support. Violent clashes withriot police have dropped sharply in recent days as the number ofstudents taking part has dwindled.   A few onlookers even shouted abuse at protesters at Kookmin,accusing them of trying to wreck the Olympics. ``Go home. You areshaming our nation,'' screamed an angry old man.   The radicals are demanding the Olympics be shared with NorthKorea to promote reunification of the Korean Peninsula, dividedsince 1945.   Radicals also contend the Roh government is a front for militaryrule and is using the Olympics to cement its rule with aid from theUnited States.   The great majority of Koreans, including most students, want theOlympics to be a major success. ``Students know the people areagainst these demonstrations,'' a student leader said today.   North Korea is boycotting the Olympics because its demand to bea co-host of the Games was rejected. The International OlympicCommittee said the Games are awarded to a single city and cannot beshared.</TEXT></DOC>
