MichaelDukakis run neck-and-neck as favorites for the presidency, whileBush outpolls other potential Democratic nominees, a CBS News-NewYork Times poll said Thursday.   Among Democratic voters alone, Dukakis was seen as the candidatewith the best chance of beating Bush in November, the survey said.Bush has a commanding lead in his race for the Republicanpresidential nomination.   In a Bush-Dukakis matchup, 46 percent of all registered voterspolled said they favored Bush and 45 percent chose Dukakis. Themargin of error for the survey was plus or minus 3 percentagepoints.   Bush polled 51 percent support to 36 percent for Sen. AlbertGore Jr. of Tennessee and 56 percent to 32 percent for JesseJackson. The poll did not include a matchup of Bush vs. Rep.Richard Gephardt of Missouri or Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois.   In a similar poll reported Wednesday by ABC News and theWashington Post, Dukakis had 50 percent support, Bush 45. Thatsurvey had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 points, so thespread did not signify a lead.   Among likely Democratic voters in the CBS-Times poll, 53 percentsaid Dukakis had the best chance of defeating Bush in the generalelection. Twelve percent said Jackson, 9 percent Gore, 8 percentGephardt and 6 percent Simon.
