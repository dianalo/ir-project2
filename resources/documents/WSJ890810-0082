The former union official, Albert J. DeAngelis, was the sole defendant remaining in the case, which involved transactions from January 1981 through December 1982. In its civil suit, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Mr. DeAngelis with making illegal profits of $362,793 through the insider trading. The judge ordered Mr. DeAngelis to disgorge all the profits, plus interest. Criminal charges against Mr. DeAngelis were previously dropped.    The other defendants in the case included a former office manager at Sullivan andamp; Cromwell and his stockbroker, who both pleaded guilty to criminal charges of insider trading in 1985. The rest of the defendants in the case either lost or settled civil suits resulting in the disgorgement of their profits.    U.S. Judge Kimba M. Wood found that Mr. DeAngelis illegally used inside information when he traded in the securities of Marathon Oil Co., Penn Central Corp. and Signode Corp. The information was obtained from the employee at Sullivan andamp; Cromwell and then passed on to Mr. DeAngelis.    Mr. DeAngelis's attorney couldn't be reached for comment. At the trial, Mr. DeAngelis claimed that he bought the stocks based on information he gleaned from articles in foreign newspapers and an article in a Teamsters booklet. He was unable to produce those articles or to recall details of them in court, the judge said. </TEXT></DOC>
