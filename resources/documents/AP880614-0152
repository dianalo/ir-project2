Court clerks did not show up for work and tax offices wereclosed.   The job action originally was open-ended, but organizers latercalled on workers to return to their jobs Wednesday.   Union leaders said they will attach their labor dispute to thewage negotiations being held between the Histadrut trade unionfederation and the Finance Ministry.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir condemned the strike. ``I thinkthere was no need for the strike that causes damages and createsinconvenience for the economy,'' he told Israel radio.   At Ben Gurion International Airport, an emergency staff of 10out of 180 customs officials checked the luggage of passengers onincoming flights, Israel army radio reported.   The strike affected the Interior Ministry, which stopped issuingidentity cards and passports, as well as the Employment Service andthe National Insurance Institute. Israel's Educational Televisionstopped its broadcasts.   The strike came after the failure of seven-hour talks Mondaybetween the union of civil servants and the Finance Ministry. Mediareports said the ministry told the strikers it will exclude thestrike days from their salaries.   But union secretary Reuven Ben-Ami told the army radio that thecivil servants, whose average monthly salary is about $625, are``ready to sacrifice to achieve better wages.''   Union officials said they are demanding a wage increase of $77,a raise in medical payments and an increase in the annualrecreation period covered by these payments to 15 days instead of11.</TEXT></DOC>
