The price wasn't disclosed.    Earlier this year, Houston-based Panhandle merged with Texas Eastern in a $3.22 billion transaction that loaded Panhandle with debt and forced it to sell Texas Eastern's non-pipeline assets. La Gloria consists of a 50,000-barrel-a-day petroleum refinery, an East Texas pipeline and related assets.    Crown Central is an independent producer, refiner and marketer of petroleum products. It already operates a 100,000 barrel-a-day refinery in Texas on the Houston Ship Channel.    Panhandle, now operator of one of the nation's largest natural-gas pipeline networks, said it expects that sale to be completed this fall. The last remaining property from the Texas Eastern acquisition is a downtown Houston real-estate complex with a book value of $540 million. </TEXT></DOC>
