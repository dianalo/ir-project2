Whitehead said. ``The situation there is very sad.''   Whitehead also said that during a trip to Algeria this week hewill urge leaders to see that the hijackers of a Kuwaiti airliner,who might still be in Algeria, are ``brought to justice.''   U.S. officials disclosed earlier last week that U.S. support forPoland's economic programs would flag unless the Polish governmentresumes a dialogue with labor groups, but in an interview withthree reporters, Whitehead defined the U.S. position with greaterdetail and clarity.   Since lifting sanctions in 1986, the United States has beencautiously encouraging economic recovery in Poland and has pledgedto support Warsaw's plea for assistance from internationalfinancial institutions.   Whitehead said the Polish program _ which includes wage andprice austerity _ would never be effective without popular support.He said that must be achieved through consultations with workers,notably the Solidarity free trade movement that is leading thecurrent strikes.   ``We are urging the government to establish a dialogue with theworkers of Poland, including members of Solidarity'' to create an``enthusiasm'' for the program, he said.   ``We believe until that happens that the economic program of thegovernment, which strikes us as being a basically sensible program,will not be able to become effective,'' he said. As a result, ``theability of the United States to support that program will beruined.''   He said the United States had been planning to back Poland'sapplications for loans from the World Bank and to work with theso-called ``Paris Club'' of lender nations to restructure Poland'smassive foreign debt.   There also is a possibility of direct U.S. assistance, Whiteheadsaid.   ``But all of those things are now in jeopardy because of thelack of a kind of national reconciliation,'' Whitehead said.   Asked why Poland acted so strenuously against the strikers,knowing the United States would react strongly, Whitehead said``the Polish government evidently feels that it can impose aneconomic program on the country without any kind of participationof the people in developing the program.   ``We have felt all along it is not possible to do it that wayand now the evidence begins to appear that it is not possible,'' hesaid.   Whitehead's visit to Poland last year was the highest-rankingState Department mission to that country since the martial lawcrackdown against Solidarity in 1981, and he has been to otherEastern European countries as the Reagan administration officialwith special responsibility for relations with the Soviet blocnations.   During his visits, he has told leaders that improved performanceon human rights and moves toward freer economic life will lead tothe closer commercial ties they have been seeking with the UnitedStates.   Whitehead is scheduled on Monday to begin a 12-day trip toMorocco, Tunisia, Algeria and France.   In Algeria, he said, he would seek more information from thegovernment on its role in the ending of last month's Kuwaiti AirLines hijacking. The plane, captured by gunmen seeking the releaseof Shiite Moslems imprisoned on terrorism charges in Kuwait, endedup in Algiers, where authorities talked the hijackers into freeingthe passengers.   There have been unconfirmed published reports that the hijackersare still in Algeria but Whitehead said ``we don't know for sure.''   He repeated U.S. pleas to Algeria _ and any other country wherethe hijackers might be _ to arrest them.   ``We will set forth our views strongly, that hijackers shouldnot be allowed to get away with their criminal acts and must bebrought to justice,'' Whitehead said.</TEXT></DOC>
