Alan C. Nelson, commissioner of the Immigration andNaturalization Service, told a House panel Thursday that there's noalternative to detaining the refugees while their claims for asylumare processed, because they'll never be found if given freedom totravel.   ``It looks like an impending disaster,'' said Rep. Bruce A.Morrison, chairman of the House Judiciary immigration subcommittee.He said the INS detention facility at Port Isabel, Texas _ now with1,700 refugees _ would soon reach its capacity of 5,000.   The commissioner said the key to slowing down the stream ofimmigrants depends on ``whether the word gets down the line'' that``there's no free ride'' any more for those crossing the U.S. borderillegally.   Nelson said the refugees, coming for economic reasons, areabusing the asylum process by contending they meet the test of awell-founded fear of persecution in their native countries.   ``We have other detention facilities'' if the Port Isabelfacility is filled up, Nelson said, including arrangements withcounty governments for use of their jails and for use of militaryfacilities.   Morrison, D-Conn., and Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, also contendedthat the crush of refugees has caused the Bush administration toreverse the Reagan administration's policy of favoritism towardasylum requests of Nicaraguans fleeing the communist Sandinistagovernment.   ``Something extraordinary is going on,'' Morrison said, citing adrastic decline in approvals for Nicaraguan asylum requests sincethe latest influx of refugees began straining the resources of theINS.   Nelson insisted there's been ``no change'' in policy, assertingthat the Nicaraguans coming now were doing so for economic reasons,while more of their predecessors came because of politicalpersecution.   ``I've got to call them as I see them,'' Nelson said, contendingeach case is reviewed on its own merits.   But Morrison said he suspected a deliberate policy change becauseasylum approvals for Nicaraguans dropped from 53 percent from1983-88 to as low as 2 percent on one day sampled last month.   ``I don't know there's a discrepancy,'' Nelson said to a round oflaughter in the hearing room.   Bryant asked, ``Is everything okay in Nicaragua? Has the bookchanged so you're saying things are not so bad?''   Nelson and Paula Dobriansky, deputy assistant secretary of statefor human rights, assured the panel they still believed Nicaragua'scommunist government was persecuting its people.   Bryant said that former Attorney General Edwin Meese III invitedNicaraguans to flee in a July 8, 1987, news release announcing aliberalization of immigration standards for 200,000 Nicaraguanexiles then in the United States. The administration stronglyindicated that none of the Nicaraguans would be deported.   Bryant said there was a ``shocking discrepancy'' between the 53.1percent approval rate for Nicaraguans from 1983-88 and the 2.7percent approval for those fleeing the U.S.-backed government in ElSalvador. ``I have serious doubt about that much disproportion,'' hesaid.   Morrison asked Ms. Dobriansky, ``Do you have confidence that ifwe go and look at a sampling (of cases) ... we will find noideological or political basis'' for asylum decisions?''   ``I have not reviewed the cases,'' she said. ``We follow thecriteria.''</TEXT></DOC>
