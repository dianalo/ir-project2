Comments receivedduring this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60)days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments receivedand will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make finalthe agreement's proposed order.The proposed complaint alleges that AMC's authorized Renault dealers oftenfailed to repair successfully automatic transmission fluid and engine oilleaks and problems related to such leaks in 1983, 1984, and 1985 modelyear Renault Alliance automobiles and 1984 to 1985 model year Renault Encoreautomobiles, as required by the written warranties issued by AMSC. Thecomplaint alleges AMC's failure to honor warranty obligations was a breachof contract which caused substantial injury to consumers. The complaintalleges that AMC's failure to honor its warranty obligations constitutedand unfair trade practice in violation of section 5 of the FTC Act.The proposed consent agreement requires Jeep Eagle, as successor corporationto AMC and AMSC, to implement a redress program to benefit approximately2,000 purchasers of new 1983, 1984, and 1985 model year Renault Allianceautomobiles and new 1984 to 1985 Renault Encore automobiles that experiencedfour or more documented repair visits to correct specific automatic transmissionfluid and engine oil leaks and related problems.The redress program provides for:1. Cash redress to be calculated as follows: $40.00 per documented repairvisit beginning with the fourth visit, to each purchaser of a new 1983,1984, or 1985 model year Alliance automobile or a new 1984 or 1985 modelyear Encore automobile who experienced four or more dealer repair visitsfor certain specified automatic transmission fluid leak problems, engineoil leak problems and related problems during the term of their full andlimited warranties (24 months/24,000 miles).2. Notice of the redress program mailed to the last known address of theapproximately 2,000 purchasers shown to be eligible for redress by AMC'swarranty records. The checks will be mailed to eligible purchasers as soonas possible, but no later than 10 months from the date that the order becomesfinal.3. Jeep Eagle also agrees to pay purchasers who do not receive notice ofthe redress program but who submit documented evidence to Jeep Eagle offour or more automatic transmission fluid, engine oil leak repairs andrelated problems which fall within the specified categories during theterm of their full and limited warranties.The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposedorder, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretationof the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.<ITAG tagnum="6">Donald S.

Azcuenaga</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">In the Matter of AMC-Renault</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Having failed to find reason to believe that AMC-Renault or Jeep-EagleCorporation, its successor, has violated the law as alleged in this complaint,I dissent from the Commission's decision to accept this consent agreementfor public comment. Although I have substantial sympathy for the plightof consumers affected by the conduct alleged, the Commission can imposea remedy only when it has reason to believe that a violation of law hasoccurred. Here that burden has not been met.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Concurring Statement of Commissioner Andrew J. Strenio, Jr. AMC-Renault,File No. 842 3103</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission has accepted for public comment the consent agreementnegotiated with Jeep Eagle Corporation, the successor to American MotorsCorporation (``AMC''). This agreement is in response to allegations thatAMC breached its full and limited warranties_and thereby committed an unfairpractice in violation of section 5 of the FTC Act_by failing within a reasonabletime to repair successfully fluid and oil leaks in the automatic transmissionsand engines of many 1983 to 1985 Renault Encore and Alliance vehicles.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In her dissenting statement, Commissioner Machol commends staff'sdiligence in attempting to resolve this matter but criticizes the Commissionfor accepting the settlement. I join in her words of thanks to currentstaff for the arduous work completed, but respectfully conclude insteadthat the Commission is justified in provisionally accepting the proposedconsent and placing it on the public record for comment. In essence, althoughI agree with most of the cautionary principles espoused by CommissionerMachol as a general matter, to me this particular settlement on these particularfacts appears compatible with those principles.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To be sure, the proposed consent may be imperfect in some regards.If we were writing upon a cleaner slate rather than this one which hasbeen smudged by numerous tracings and erasures over the five-plus yearssince the investigation began, I might be tempted to send the consent backfor renegotiation.\1\<NOTE/> As it is, though, in this context the responsible choiceis between provisionally accepting the consent intact or closing the investigation.Since the Commission has reason to believe sufficient to issue the relatedcomplaint, and none of the ``policy'' arguments justifies rejection intoto of the relief obtained in the agreement for the injured consumers,I favor provisionally accepting the consent intact.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ In particular, I question the terms of the consent whichdo not require sending notice of the settlement to all owners, yet wouldpermit any unclaimed redress to revert to the proposed respondent. Further,it is not self-evident that either the lack of prospective injunctive reliefor the omission of the potential Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act basis for thiscase is desirable.<ITAG tagnum="21">Regarding the ``reason to believe'' aspect, I find on balance thatstaff at this point has presented adquate evidence to meet the three-prongedtest for issuance of an unfairness complaint based upon Section 5.\2\<NOTE/> The net effect of the evidence provides reason to believethat the consumer injury flowing from the conduct in question was: (1)substantial; (2) not outweighed by any offsetting consumer or competitivebenefits that the practice produced; and (3) not something consumers reasonablycould have avoided. More evidence on each of these points might well havebeen adduced had this matter gone into litigation, yet the existing evidencesuffices in conjunction with the signed consent before us.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ In this regard, I respectfully differ with CommissionerAzcuenaga's conclusion.<ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, allow me to elaborate upon two points. Point one involvesthe substantial nature of the consumer injury here. No doubt, this caseis far from the biggest the FTC has ever handled and the numbers are lowerthan might have been expected earlier. Still, with approximately 2,000consumers eligible for some $120,000 in redress payments, the absolutenumbers are respectable and exceed the figures in a great many cases theCommission brings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is true that the class of purchasers who suffered through fouror more repair attempts during the time the warranties were in effect (``redressclass'') is a small subset of all purchasers of 1983 to 1985 Renault Encoreor Alliance vehicles with automatic transmissions (``total purchasers'').But I do not consider this first comparison determinative. A no less applicablecomparison would look to the ratio of the redress class to the set of allpurchasers who invoked their warranty protection for serious leakage difficultieswith their automatic transmissions and engines. On the evidence beforeus, this ratio indicates substantial injury to consumers.\3\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ To explore why this type of comparison is no less relevantto the question at hand than the first type of comparison, assume thatAMC had sold one million cars in 1983 and offered a warranty only on itswindshield wiper blades and on leaks from its transmissions. Assume, further,that over the years AMC received 100,000 warranty complaints on its 1983vehicles. Of these, say that 94,000 involved windshield wiper blades andthat every such complaint was handled to the customer's satisfaction onthe first repair visit. But of the 6,000 transmission leak complaints,say that at least 1,000 required four or more repair visits.<ITAG tagnum="28">It would theoretically be possible to characterize this transmissionwarranty problem as ``non-substantial'' since only 6 percent of all complainingpurchasers had problems with their transmissions and only 1 percent encounteredthe four-plus repairs situation. But such a characterization would notbe compelling given the importance of transmissions as a warranty itemand the relative frequency with which a transmission complaint became atransmission nightmare.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We should not place excessive weight in this setting upon either typeof comparison made in the paragraph above. After all, whether the incidenceof four-plus repair odysseys was relatively greater or lesser, these repeatedlyunsuccessful efforts may well have constituted a breach of AMC's warrantyin substantial numbers (i.e. some 2,000 times) on a system critical toa car's operation. AMC made a promise to purchasers that it would repairor replace covered components ``within a reasonable time.'' This is nota promise that was inferred from AMC's conduct or implied by AMC's language;it is a promise that AMC expressly made in so many words in its warranties.AMC's failure_time and time again_to honor this express promise is thecrux of the case. I am satisfied that staff's suggestion, and Jeep Eagle'sacceptance, of four repair visits as the threshold for relief is a defensiblereading of ``a reasonable time'' on the evidence presented here. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Point two is that accepting this consent is sensible from a policyperspective. To begin with, the settlement terms represent a unique negotiatedsolution to a complicated and specific set of circumstances. These termsdo not establish four as the threshold of an unreasonable number of attemptsto fix a warranty problem under other circumstances.\4\<NOTE/> Indeed, in the abstract at least, a high or lower thresholdcould be justified under other circumstances. Accordingly, the facts ofany subsequent case properly will be decisive should this threshold issuerecur. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Had this case been based upon Magnuson-Moss, of course,the possibility of establishing binding precedent might not have been soremote. <ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, while I will not belabor the twists and turns that theinvestigation took once AMC resisted providing requested information, thisconsent hardly is likely to ``intimidate'' the industry in any fashion_letalone into adopting four as a de facto threshold standard. Attributingexcessive zeal to the FTC is not an apt description for this situationwhere the warranty program, the manufacture of Encores and Alliances, andAMC itself all had gone out of existence before the Commission began contemplationof the consent. For that matter, in light of this history, the consentis more likely to be interpreted by the industry as a slap on the wristthan a kick in the pants. On the other hand, to reject the consent in itsentirety would run a serious risk of sending a message of complete indifferenceby the Commission regarding AMC's alleged behavior toward consumers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Moreover, this consent does not venture into the swamp of dictatingto the industry a particular combination of automobile reliability andwarranty coverage. As this settlement has been crafted, it merely saysthat AMC (or its successor) must live up to the warranty coverage thatit chose to offer in the marketplace. This does not look like a case whereAMC said (exclicitly or implicitly) to the prospective purchasers, ``Youcan save some money here by buying our car, but the tradeoff is you willincur a higher risk of flaws and/or narrower warranty protection.'' Tothe contrary, apart and aside from the detailed coverage guaranteed inthe full and limited warranties accompanying the vehicles, AMC's marketingemphasizing the asserted superiority of its warranties as an inducementto purchase. A corporation that makes specific claims of warranty protection(not to mention claims of warranty superiority) ordinarily ought to laterbe excused from honoring those claims on the ground that by some overallmeasure its performance is roughly average. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In this sense, rejection of the consent by the Commission could domore than deprive consumers injured by AMC's alleged breaches of some redressfunds. It also could lead to inefficiency and distortion in the automobilemarket if consumers no longer can rely upon written warranties as a basisfor comparison shopping. Rejection also could inflict injury upon car manufacturerswho abide by their warranties yet lose sales to competitors who promisemore coverage than they deliver. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the above reasons, I have voted to provisionally accept the proposedconsent agreement and place it, along with the draft complaint, on thepublic record for comment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Margot E. Machol, AMC-Renault,File No. 842-3103 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I would have preferred to close this investigation rather than acceptthe settlement submitted by staff. Warranty and reliability issues arecomplex, and compiling the relevant information is difficult. AlthoughI oppose the staff recommendation, I commend their diligence in attemptingto resolve this matter. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When this investigation began five years ago, it looked as thoughit would be a good case. Tens of thousands of consumers apparently wereplagued by leaks in their AMC/Renault Alliances and Encores. Only afterthe general framework of the settlement had been negotiated did it becomeapparent that relatively few consumers had persistent leaks as coveredby the order. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I was at first tempted to accept the settlement. Commission actionwill lead to a major automobile manufacturer paying $120,000 to approximately2,000 consumers. These consumers clearly were inconvenienced by an unexpectedlyhigh number of dealer visits to have leaks repaired Despite its initialappeal, however, I have voted against accepting the settlement. I do notbelieve section 5 has been violated because I do not believe that AMC'sconduct meets our unfairness criteria. In addition, I believe that acceptingthe settlement is not in the public interest because it sets a deleteriousprecedent. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission has previously stated that it will find a practiceunfair only when, <T3>inter alia,</T3> the practice produced substantial consumer injury.Injury is weighed in the context of the market in which the injury is allegedto have occurred. In this matter, the consumer injury is not substantial.Fewer than 1 percent of purchasers of Alliances and Encores made 4 or morevisits to repair leaks and fewer than 3 tenths of 1 percent had 5 or morevisits to repair leaks. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Further, consumers may not actually have been injured. <T3>Consumer Reports</T3> indicates that, although Alliances and Encoreshad worse-than-average to much-worse-than-average incidence of repair duringtheir warranty periods, the cars had less-than-average to average costof repairs. Thus, the warranty coverage was successful in shifing the costof repairs from car owners to AMC. Commissioner Azcuenaga has previouslystated that it ``seems inappropriate to term a car `defective' unless itsoverall repair costs are significantly greater than those of comparablecars.''\1\<NOTE/> Similarly, here it seems inappropriate to find warranty coveragedefective unless overall repair costs are significantly greater than thoseof comparable cars. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ ``Defects Cases: What Legal Theories, Evidentiary Standardsand Remedies Should Apply?'' Speech Before the Sixteenth Annual Meetingof the National Advertising Review Board, New York, New York, December9, 1987, page 9. <ITAG tagnum="21">I believe that this settlement sets an undesirable precedent becauseit articulates a standard that four or more attempts to repair transmissionand engine leaks is an unfair practice under section 5. Some play downthe precedent by arguing that the order provision here should not be viewedas anything more than the result of negotiations that led to successfulresolution of a difficult case. I respectfully disagree. The underlyingtheory of the complaint is that some number of repair visits (in this case,four) constitutes a breach of contract in violation of section 5. Thereis no reason to believe, however, that the FTC or any other governmentagency would do as well as the market in deciding the most desirable combinationof automobile reliability and warranty coverage. The Commission shouldreserve action to those cases in which it has some evidence that a companybehaved unreasonably. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other Commission cases demonstrate the kind of evidence that would,in my mind, justify Commission action. In <T3>International Harvester</T3> (104 F.T.C. 949), for example, the companyknew that fuel geysering could maim or kill tractor operators, yet it failedto provide simple, low-cost warning labels. In <T3>Orkin</T3> (108 F.T.C. 263), the company had a widespread, systematicprogram to breach its contracts. The breach unilaterally shifted coststo its customers and harmed competition in addition to harming consumers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Such conduct is conspicuously absent in this case. Unlike <T3>International Harvester,</T3> safety issues are not involved. Unlike<T3>Orkin,</T3> AMC did not unilaterally shift costs to its customers.AMC did not refuse to provide warranty service; in fact, AMC repaired leakson some vehicles up to 12 times. Repairing transmission leaks is oftenexpensive; AMC undoubtedly would have adopted more reliable repairs ifthey had been available. Further, AMC did not gain a competitive edge byits actions. Alliances and Encores are no longer produced and AMC was wellalong its way toward bankruptcy when Chrysler purchased it in 1987. Consumersappropriately punished AMC and rewarded more efficient competitors. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">My final objection to this consent is that it obtains relief thatwe would not be able to obtain in litigation. Neither a section 19 actionnor a section 13(b) action predicated on section 19 principles would producemonetary relief because there is no evidence of dishonest or fraudulentconduct. As a matter of policy, I believe that relief obtained in consentsshould be limited to the potential relief available through litigation.Therefore, I have voted against accepting the settlement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-27452-31-11-22-89; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6750-01-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
