 For observers involved in the PC industry,the Motif/OPEN LOOK (and, more abstractly, the OSF/Sun) contest gives themmaterial over which they can shake their heads and wonder if Unix really willblow it, giving OS/2 another lease on life.andP;  Even some within the Unix worldare a bit bewildered by the choices.andP;  Aren't both solutions, after all, basedon the same set of standards?andP;  (Well, as we'll see below, sort of.)andM;But the competition between the two graphical user environments really getsto the heart of two different strategies for promoting Unix as a widespreadsolution, particularly in the commercial world.andM;The OSF/Motif camp has standardized on an environment designed to promotemaximum support in a heterogeneous environment.andP;  The look-and-feel mapsclosely to Presentation Manager (PM) and Windows 3.0 (especially after thelatter was retrofitted, or &quot;Motif-ed,&quot; by the addition of features such as a3-D bezel).andP;  This &quot;closeness&quot; to IBM is a source of great comfort for thecommercial side, which now sees a way to slide Unix systems right intocorporate information systems and networks.andP;  It also helps that some of thebigger Motif supporters (such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard) are majorinfluences on both the non-Unix and Unix commercial systems markets.andP;  As aresult, OSF/Motif is currently available on more than 100 hardware platformsand 42 operating systems from 42 hardware suppliers.andM;The Sun/ATandamp;T camp, on the other hand, was driven by a different rationale,seeking to provide what they thought was a better-designed user interfaceenvironment: OPEN LOOK.andP;  Some of the design decisions were made in aconscious attempt to deliver on Unix the same type of consistent, easy-to-useenvironment offered on the Macintosh.andP;  Or, put another way, Sun looked at thetwo most likely choices for mainstream graphical user interfaces (GUIs)--theMacintosh and the Presentation Manager--and decided that, of the two, itwould rather be like the Macintosh.andM;Recognizing that, Sun knew that several tasks were ahead of it:andM;* Promoting an inexpensive standard platform upon which this new GUI andresulting applications could runandM;* Enticing key applications developers to write for the environmentandM;* Enticing corporate in-house application developers to write for theenvironmentandM;* Making sure that the resulting systems could use emerging standards andcould become part of the emerging distributed computing environmentsandM;Sun's &quot;All our wood behind one arrow&quot; slogan basically embodies thatrecognition.andP;  (See Illustration 1.)andP;  Sun's focus is on providing one set ofcost-effective, high-performance, advanced technologies with enough of amarket share to make it a magnet for the application developers thatultimately determine the fate of a system.andP;  This is basically a blend of thestandards-based strategy that catapulted Sun to its current position and the&quot;We have a better idea&quot; approach taken by Apple with the Macintosh.andM;A key element in the success of the strategy is OpenWindows, Sun's GUIapplication and development environment.andP;  Unless it can migrate its currentbase of 2,800 SunView applications over to the new windowing system and canattract and keep third-party developers, Sun will have a difficult timemaintaining its market share and leadership position.andP;  OpenWindows isfundamental to that migration and expansion.andP;  (As a way to encouragemigration, OpenWindows supports SunView binaries.andP;  Thus, you can haveSunView, X, and NeWS windows all open on screen at the same time.)andM;The SPARC component of the strategy seems to be working.andP;  Last quarter, Sunshipped 28,000 SPARCstations, and expects to hit a shipment rate of 15,000workstations per month later this year--an annualized rate of 180,000 unitsper year.andP;  In Unix workstation terms, that's a big market.andP;  (Almost bigenough for Microsoft to sit up and take notice.)andM;Goldman Sachs has released estimates of workstation shipments for thiscalendar year.andP;  The results are shown in Illustration 2.andP;  Sun clearly has thelion's share.andP;  Even if the other three vendors are added together asdelivering Motif interfaces, that still gives Sun alone a 62 percent marginover the Motif group: 170,000 workstations to 105,000.andP;  Then factor in theinformation that those three aren't yet all shipping Motif, and that, whenthey do, there will be possibly be some variations in implementation, and theSun lead becomes even stronger.andM;Our early comment about Microsoft was not all in jest.andP;  Independent softwarevendors (ISVs) are driven by unit volume, not abstract notions of excellence.andO;The more nodes out in the market, the more likely it is that major ISVs willwrite applications for those platforms.andP;  That, in turn, creates more demandfor the platforms, and so the spiral goes.andP;  (Unit volume is not the onlyfactor at work, however.andP;  Other factors include standardization policies oflarge corporations and reasonable expectations of market growth.)andM;Not surprisingly, given the unit volume, the OPEN LOOK approach seems to begaining steam, too.andP;  Sun has shipped 10,000 developer's kits for itsOpenWindows environment.andP;  In the July announcement of its new Inter-ProcessCommunication (IPC) workstation, Sun released a guide listing some 100 OPENLOOK applications ready or close to shipment.andP;  The company expects 300third-party applications to be available by the end of the year.andP;  Importantlyfor Sun, many of those so lured are the heavyweight PC developers such asLotus, Ashton-Tate, and AutoCAD.andM;Personal Workstation magazine does a monthly survey of the number ofapplications that are actually shipping in the new GUI environments.andP;  ForSeptember, OPEN LOOK applications led the pack with 55 in the channels,compared to 23 NextStep applications, 22 OS/2 PM applications, and 17 Motifapplications.andM;OpenWindows Version 2andM;OpenWindows Version 2 is the first general purpose release of the environmentand is intended for end users as well as developers.andP;  OpenWindows consists ofan X Window development environment that adheres to OPEN LOOK, the GUIitself, and a set of graphics-oriented personal productivity tools, theDeskSet tools (see Illustration 3).andM;As we'll explore below, OpenWindows offers a choice of three toolkits: one tosupport SunView migration over to X Window; another for pure X Windowdevelopment; and the third for the development of NeWS applications.andP;  (Thesethree are all part of the SunView Release 4 (SVR4) release package: twotoolkits based on X, one based on the X Intrinsics and one based on NeWS.)andM;Sun released OpenWindows Version 2 in late July.andP;  This version uses the new3-D version of the OPEN LOOK graphical user interface, contains 3-D DeskSettools, and also incorporates a new release of the X11/NeWS server that boostsperformance by up to five times.andM;Determined to encourage adoption and migration, Sun is bundling OpenWindowsin all diskful SPARCstations at no cost.andP;  Furthermore, Sun is not charging alicensing fee for developers who order OpenWindows.andM;OpenWindows Version 2 now uses the Xlib of X11 Release 4.andP;  Althoughsource-level compatibility should require no porting, applications designedfor OpenWindows 1.1 will need to be relinked with the new libraries.andM;Currently, SunView binaries can run unmodified on OpenWindows.andP;  In otherwords, an OpenWindows screen can contain SunView, X, and NeWS windowssimultaneously.andP;  There are a few irregularities.andP;  SunView windows alwaysobscure X11 and NeWS windows, for example.andM;However, as noted above, beginning with the SVR4, Sun will no longer supportthe SunView development environment.andP;  Users can continue to run existingSunView applications under the binary compatibility mode, but will not beable to compile new SunView applications on that and future OS releases.andP;  Byfiat, OpenWindows becomes the default window system.andM;The other major piece is Sun's Developer's Guide (Graphical User InterfaceDesign Environment), a graphical interface builder.andM;OPEN LOOK 2.0.andP;  The second release of OPEN LOOK includes performanceenhancements and reduced system memory requirements in addition to providingfor the 3-D look of the interface.andM;In addition to the X toolkit with the OPEN LOOK widget set, OPEN LOOKprovides a set of X clients:andM;* Workspace Manager controls all desktop properties, such as color, mousebutton, and keyboard assignments.andP;  It functions as a session manager,controlling program execution, end and resume functions, and clipboardfunctions.andM;* The OPEN LOOK Window Manager controls the appearance and placement ofwindows on screen and supports the use of icons.andM;* File Manager enables users to view and manipulate files in a graphicalmanner.andP;  This is the point of implementing the &quot;drag-and-drop&quot; protocol thatprovides a level of direct manipulation of icons representing directories,data files, and applications in the system.andM;Sun and ATandamp;T have done some interesting things with the File Manager.andP;  Forexample, in addition to the direct manipulation of the icons for proceduressuch as printing, copying, and so on, the File Manager lets you launch anapplication simply by dragging the icon onto the workspace--the blank part ofthe screen.andP;  (We really like this feature.andP;  It beats double-clicking, and itcertainly beats going through a workspace menu.)andM;What actually happens is that in moving an icon outside the border of theFile Manager base window, you create an operating system link to theapplication.andP;  When you release the Select button, the application launches.andM;To load a file into an application, you can drag the data file from the FileManager and rop it onto an application window or icon.andM;Sun views (non pun intended) drag-and-drop as one of its key advantages overthe Motig environment as it comes out on the OSF tapes.andP;  Now the variousMotif implements need to provide this type of functionality on their own(which HP, for example, is doing with its VUE environment for its Unixworkstation).andP;  That opens up the question of consistency for developersacross differenct Motif implementations.andM;Currently, the drag-and-drop protocol is what Sun calls &quot;first level.&quot;andO;Developers are working on more robust implementations for the future.andP;  Forexample, what does it mean when you drag-and-drop an icon that actually liveson a file server 4,000 miles away?andM;Open Windows supports drag-and-drop for copying data into other applicationsonly between two XView applications or between two OPEN LOOK IntrinsicsToolkit (OLIT)--pure X Window--applications.andP;  In the future, Sun plans toprovide drag-and-drop integration among the three OPEN LOOK toolkits.andM;* XTerm terminal emulator provides the character terminal emulator for accessto character-based applications.andP;  (Sun prefers to use the shell tool thecommand tool for terminal emulation.andP;  The command tool provides mouse supportfor editing, keeps a history log of command entered, and so on.)andM;DESKSET TOOLS.andP;  The concept of the DeskSet tools is not unique to Sun.andO;Digital Equipment Corporation provided something similar with its DECwindowsenvironment.andP;  Sun's toold provide user support for some of the features ofthe Open windows environment, however, such as the ability to associateapplications and data files with icons.andP;  The DeskSet include the following.andM;* File Manager provides a visual representation of the hierarchical Unix fielstructure.andM;* Calendar Manager provides a scheduling tool.andP;  The tool works across groupsas well, allowing users to check other users' calendars and to makeappointments in those calendars, as long as the permission to do so exists.andO;(The phrase &quot;As long as....&quot; is one that is going to haunt usrs for the nextfew years, we're afraid.)andM;* Print tool supports the dragging and dropping of an icon to invokeprinting.andM;* Tape tool provides an easy way to read, write, or list data from a local orremote tape drive (no more tar).andM;* CalculatorandM;* Mail tool.andM;* Binder allows users to associate actions and applications to color-codedicons, also taking advantage of drag-and-drop.andM;* Snapshot tool captures all or a protion of the screen.andM;* Text editor is a mouse-driven tool enabling interactive text editing.andM;* Icon editor supports the creation and revision of icons and cursor images.andM;* Performance meters give a graphical view of system performance.andM;* A clock displays time and date.andM;X11/NEWS WINDOWS SYSTEM.andP;  Sun was an early innovator in delivering graphicaluser interface systems.andP;  Sun's first windowing system--SunView 1.0--wasproprietary (although open and licensable) and successful.andM;Since standards and open systems had fueled Sun's success, however, thecompany wanted to replicate the openness in all areas.andP;  It wanted anetwork-based windowing system that was as hardware independent as was thesuccessful Network File System (NFS).andP;  SunView, by contrast, is kernel-based.andM;Sun's first attempt at providing a more functional and portable successor toSunView was NeWS: the Network/extensible Window System.andP;  Sun hoped to turnNeWS into the next de facto network standard.andM;NeWS, although it was not built on top of X, uses a client/server model forthe network.andP;  NeWS uses PostScript as its foundation, for many of the samereasons that Digital had when it later opted to use Display PostScript as anextension to X.andM;NeWS enhanced PostScript to provide, for example, input and window-handling.andO;From a desire to maintain compatibility with a standard, NeWS currentlysupports the full set of the Red Book operators, according to Sun.andP;  (The &quot;RedBook&quot; is the PostScript Language Reference Manual published byAddison-Wesley.)andP;  Sun even figured out how to emulate those operators of theRed Book that wouldn't normally be required for a window systeM.andM;PostScript eliminates the need for caching bit maps, for example, by definingthe outline of the font for scaling and then filing it in.andP;  NeWS implementedsome primitive, but didn't do the on-the-fly conversion to bit maps.andP;  Itrelies upon some caching.andP;  (As we'll discuss below, Sun licensed the Foliofont technology to provide the foundation for its OpenFonts component ofOpenWindows.)andM;With the ATandamp;T and Sun decision to merge SunOS with System V came a need forSun to support X.andP;  It also obviously had to provide support for SunView.andP;  Theresult is the X11/NeWS merged window server.andM;X11/NeWS fully supports both windowing platforms without the use ofemulators.andP;  A single application can access both NeWS and X11 concurrently.andO;X11/NeWS is a unified server, not the layering of one windowing system atopanother.andP;  (Sun had earlier been tinkering with delivering an X emulatorriding atop NeWS).andM;The merged server provides one window tree for the management of windows anda single event queue for event synchronization.andP;  The queue dispatches eventsto both NeWS and X11 clients.andP;  Clients express their request in nativeprotocols, which the server translate using a layer of protocolinterpretation (see Illustration 4).andM;Say &quot;interpreter&quot; and wary developers immediately look for some performancehit.andP;  According to Sun, degradation on the X11 side is hardly noticeable.andO;While there can be some performance hits on the NeWS side, developers can usethe structure of PostScript itself to ameliorate the situation through suchtechniques as downloading modules of code to await a triggering event (suchas a mouse event) to begin processing, rather than carrying on a conversationacross the wire.andM;The newest release used with OpenWindows Version 2 enhances performance up tofive times that of its predecessor.andP;  Additional enhancements include:andM;* Easier installation.andM;* Improved server security using MIT's &quot;magic cookie&quot; mechanism.andM;* A new default window manager, the OPEN LOOK Window Manager (OLWM), which isbuilt directly on the Xlib layer, OLWM is faster and more compact than itspredecessor.andM;* Multiscreen support.andM;* National language keyboard support for European languages (Latin 1).andM;* A change in default visual from StaticColor to PseudoColor to makeOpenWindows more compatible with other X11 environments.andM;* Support for the XGL graphics library, which gives developers access to fast3-D and 2-D graphics within their applications.andM;The X11/NeWS server supports three Sun toolkits:andM;* XViewandM;* The NeWS Toolkit (TNT)andM;* OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit (OLIT)andM;All three toolkits implement the OPEN LOOK look and feel.andP;  XVIEW.andP;  Sun faceda challenge in its shift to X: the preservation of the large and popular baseof SunView applications.andP;  Its solution was the XView toolkit.andM;The XView toolkit implements OPEN LOOK on X11 while providing a migrationpath for existing SunView applications.andP;  Sun managed to redesign and extendthe toolkit so that it supports X while still maintaining the flavor ofSunView and--more importantly--much of the API set.andM;For example, SunView uses the Pixwin interface over the Pixrect library toprovide imaging facilities.andP;  The Pixrect library supports concept such asscreen coordinates, pixels, bit maps, raster operations, vectors, and textdrawing.andP;  XView, however, uses the Xlib library of graphical operations.andP;  Toease the transition between the two windowing systems, Sun maintained thePixwin interface of SunView, but replaced the Pixrect library with the X11graphical operations.andM;The Object Model.andP;  SunView used an object-oriented system model in its text,panel, and menu packages.andP;  With XView, Sun extended the object-oriented modelto almost all of the window system packages (through the use of C's varargsto support attribute-value lists).andM;XView is an object-oriented system with static subclassing.andP;  All XViewobjects share common functions and retain SunView's support for variablelength attribute lists.andP;  Sun mostly implements XView's classes as static leafclasses.andP;  Subclasses inherit attributes from the superclass.andP;  With theexception of the TERM shell subwindow, which is subclassed from both the Ttyand text subwindow classes, XView offers single inheritance only.andP;  Allclasses are subclasses of the Generic Object class.andP;  (See Illustration 5.)andM;Of the window objects, a few are worth particular mention.andP;  the Canvassubwindow object is the area into which developers can &quot;draw&quot; their programs.andO;(See Illustration 6.)andP;  The Canvas object allows applications to draw on anarea that is larger than the visible window where the drawing appears.andO;SunView's solution for this is to implement the drawing surface as a Pixwinregion.andP;  XView, however, treats the drawing surface as a separate window thatis clipped atop the viewing window.andP;  The view window and the the scrollbars(if implemented) appear in the actual Canvas subwindow.andP;  The only visiblepart of the drawing (paint) window is that which is on top of the viewwindow.andM;Panels and Menus.andP;  SunView panels and menus offer little consistency infunction or appearance.andP;  As part of its effort to deliver a &quot;Mac-like&quot;environment, Sun made XView control panels and menus visually identical.andO;XView implements panels and menus as windows, while the individual panel andmenu items are not.andP;  As did Digital with its work on gadgets, Sun recognizedthat the sparing use of windows would enhance the performance of complexmenus and panels.andM;There are quite a few other variations between SunView and XView in areassuch as cursor implementation, icon handling, and nonvisual objects.andM;Imaging.andP;  As noted above, XView retains the Pixwin imaging interface butmakes uses of the Xlib graphical operations.andM;In SunView, all images are Pixrects, which are manipulated as data structuresin memory or as device files.andP;  When a Pixrect is displayed, the bitsrepresenting the image already reside on the same machine.andM;Such a configuration cannot be assumed in the X environment, however, XViewprovides server image objects in an X11 Pixmap represented on the client sideas a Pixrect.andP;  Thus, server images can continue to be treated as memoryPixrects, thereby maintaining SunView compatibility.andM;However, XView doesn't require Pixrects.andP;  The Sun implementation uses thePixrect library for SunView compatibility.andP;  Because XView is not bound toPixrects (which is a proprietary Sun library), it can easily be ported overto other hardware platforms.andP;  Sun is offering Ultrix, AIX, and HP-UX ports ofXView done by Unipress.andP;  Other implementations not directly available fromSun include a VMX port of XView (from TGV Incorporated), XView for A/UX (fromIntegrated Computer Solutions), and XView for DOS (!) from Quarterdeck (whichis also offering a Motif version of X).andM;The XView Notifier.andP;  Sun brought over the SunView notifier facility withlittle visible outward sign of change.andP;  Essentially, Sun managed todisconnect Notifier from the kernel and reimplement it with a connection tothe X11 input stream without greatly distributing the basic implementation.andM;Every SunView window is represented as a file descriptor; in XView, a singlefile descriptor connects to the server.andP;  SunView registers its window withthe Notifier, which, in turn, waits for input on the file descriptor for eachwindow and then sends the input to the appropriate package.andM;XView also registers its windows with the Notifier.andP;  Here, however, theNotifier waits for input on the file descriptor connected to the server.andP;  Thesystem then translates X11 input events to XView semantic events, and sendsthem to the appropriate Notifier client.andM;The XView Notifier waits for input on the socket connected to the X11 server.andO;Should an application produce displays on more than one machine, the Notifierwaits for input on more than one socket.andP;  The Notifier can register otherfile descriptors (such as a pipe) or certain signals as well, as can SunView.andO;(See Illustration 7).andM;Notifier multiplexes all the available input events into a single, orderedevent stream, eliminating the need for applications to poll separate streamsfrom the different devices.andM;Internationalization.andP;  Sun recenlty announced a Kanji version of OpenWindows,and will follow this release up with Korean and Chinese versions.andP;  (Japaneseis a major emerging market for Sun, which does some 13 percent of its totalbusiness in that country.)andP;  Sun doesn't yet have full double-byte support forlocalization of Asian languages in OpenWindows.andP;  For the current releasedversion, it took what it expects will become the mechanism for supporting thedouble-byte character set in X11R5--the X input Method (XIM)--and implementedwith the expectation that it will have a solution close to what the standardwill become.andP;  Furthermore, Sun plans to donate its Japanese OPEN LOOK toolkitto MIT.andP;  The X Consortium then will offer Japanese XView for free.andP;  (Weshould point out that XIM is not a standard yet, but it is a vendor's bestguess at what the standard will become.)andM;Full NLS support will come in the next release of OpenWindows (OW 3.0, in1991andM;Motif, by contrast, uses the User Inteface Language (UIL) from Digital, whichfully supports double byte and compound strings, including all the charactersets standardized by the X Consortium.andM;OLIT.andP;  The OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit (OLIT) is the OPEN LOOK (formerlyXt+) toolkit from Unix Software Labs (USL, formerly part of ATandamp;T), which Sunhas ported to its platform.andP;  OLIT is based on the Xt Intrinsics from the XConsortium.andP;  Xt, like other toolkits, provides a set of functionality tocreate, deploy, and destroy user interface components for the X environmentwith no enforcement of a user interface policy.andP;  The OLIT includes MIT X11R4Intrinsics and the AT andamp; T OPEN LOOK widget set.andP;  OLIT will run on anyvendor's X11 server.andP;  Xt is a common foundation for multiple toolkits, andthe API for one Xt widget set is the same as the API for another.andM;This common factor can make porting applications between different Ximplementations, such as OPEN LOOK and Motif, relatively straightforward.andO;Sun has tested porting applications back and forth and offers up a port timeof one to two weeks to move a complex application from one of thoseenvironments to the other.andP;  Some, if not much, of the work could beautomated.andM;However, as OPEN LOOK offers some differently capability and visual metaphorsthan Motif, there is no easy application portability solution outside of somerecoding or acceptance of common denominator functionality.andM;A few third parties have, however, stepped up to the challenge.andP;  (More onthis below.)andM;To recap: Although both XView and OLIT are based on Xlib, only OLIT is basedon the Xt Intrinsics.andM;TNT.andP;  The NeWS Toolkit (TNT, the successor to the &quot;Light&quot; toolkit, or NeWS1.1) is a toolkit for the merged X11/ NeWS server that supports thedevelopment of NeWS-based applications.andP;  (See Illustration 8.)andM;The current version of TNT shipping with OpenWindows is only demo code,according to Sun.andP;  It is there for developer comment and feedback but isn'trecommended as a full development environment at this time.andP;  Sun will providea fully supported version of TNT in early 1991, and will implement it with3-D OPEN LOOK under OpenWindows Version 2.andM;The NeWS server is a PostScript interpreter with extensions to support awindowing system.andP;  Application developers can modify the PostScript modulesthat constitute the server by writing some PostScript code.andP;  By contrast,extensions to X must be compiled (usually in C) into the server.andM;As does X, the NeWS environment consists of a client and a server, eachfulfilling notes roles comparable to those of their X counterparts.andP;  As in X,the client/server terminology refers to the opposite of what many peopleexpect.andP;  Servers are the displays.andP;  Clients are the applications that use thedisplays.andM;Client and server offer a layered set of interfaces from which developers canchoose.andM;Client Side.andP;  There are five client-side interfaces:andM;* serverCommunication Layer, which handles the communication between clientand server.andP;  NeWS uses the PostScript language for client/servercommunicatin.andP;  (X Window uses the X protocol.)andM;* A TNT Substrate, which distributes events and handles communication betweenuser interface objects on screen and the client interfaces.andP;  This substrateis the foundation for the higher-level interfaces.andM;* User Interface Components, which provide a set of services corresponding toOPEN LOOK components.andP;  This layer is comparable to a toolkit layer.andM;* Basic toolkit components, which include such building blocks as basic textand graphic objects.andM;* Advanced toolkit components, which present a full object-orientedprogramming environment for the creation of reusable, complex objects.andP;  Atthis level, developer should write in C++, or in C with the use of thetoolkit preprocessor to support the object model.andM;With the use of TNT comes client-side access to a hardware-independentimaging model.andP;  The &quot;stencil-paint&quot; image model uses a path (an arbitrarysequence of ponts, lines, and curves) to describe a shape or an outline.andP;  Thepath can be &quot;stroked&quot; (traced by a single line) or it can be filled.andP;  To drawsomething, you build the path and then apply color through the resultingstencil; hence, &quot;stencil-paint.&quot;andM;Once defined, a path can easily be manipulated (rotated, translated, orscaled).andP;  This imaging model uses an arbitrary coordinate system that can bemapped to a variety of displays.andP;  Any improvements in the underlying graphicsfoundation are automatically gained by the application.andM;This is quite different from the traditional device-specific raster imagemodel used in X Window, where there is a one-for-one mapping between video orraster memory and the display device.andP;  The hardware-independent imaging modelis one of the clear benefits of a PostScript foundation.andP;  (See Illustration9.)andM;Server Side.andP;  The server-side architectural layer include:andM;* Primitives and input management facilities that extend PostScript tosupport a full window system.andM;* The intrinsics, providing a generic set of common objects (menus,scrollbars) with no particular look or feel.andP;  These are quickly customized.andM;* OPEN LOOK Primitives and OPEN LOOK Components.andP;  Components such as names,menus, and button stacks consist of collections of primitives (such asbuttons, resize, corners, and pushpins).andP;  These components and primitives arefully compliant with the OPEN LOOK specs.andM;Most TNT components (with the exception of the text package and the wireservice protocol) reside in the server, unlike X, where widgets andintrinsics live on the client.andP;  This has some interesting implications forapplication design.andP;  For example, the NeWS solution enables minimal clientmemory usage, as no client memory is used to store or to execute the userinterface components.andP;  Also, because the user interface components areexecuting in the server, user actions and application responses are moretightly coupled, giving better interactive graphics performance.andP;  This isimportant in a variety of applications, including electronic publishing.andO;(Frame is using TNT to implement FrameMaker under OpenWindows.)andM;Furthermore, because the server can be extended with application-specificobjects through the use of PostScript, a developer can tune an application tominimize communication between client and server portions.andP;  This opens up thepossibility of using lowbandwidth networks for network-basedwindowing--something not very attractive in the X Window environment becauseof the message traffic generated.andP;  (A few years back, Sun actually did sometesting on a NeWS server implemented on the Atari ST with 2400-baudcommunications, and pronounced that the result reflected &quot;surprisingly goodperformance.&quot;andM;OPENFONTS.andP;  Fonts, as you may have noticed during the past year or so, havebecome a focus of major controversy for the industry.andP;  Sun is embroiled inthis as well.andM;Recognizing the need for a scalable outline font solution in itsworkstations, Sun initially tried to make a deal with Adobe.andP;  When thatfailed, Sun acquired Folio and the Folio scalable font technology in 1988.andM;The folio technology became the foundation for what Sun calls OpenFonts.andO;OpentFonts is a font-scaling module that works independently of the imagingmodel and consists of three pieces of licensed software:andM;* F3, an intelligent outline format.andM;* TypeMaker, a tool enabling type vendors to create outline font in F3 formatquickly and inexpensively.andM;* TypeScaler, which generates bit maps in any orientation, point size, orresolution for both the screen and the printer.andP;  The current release ofTypeScaler generates bit maps 30 percent faster than its predecessor.andO;Additionally, the code size overhead is smaller.andM;TypeScaler software and F3 fonts will compete with Adobe's Type Manager andType 1 fonts, and with the Apple/Microsoft Truetype fonts and scalingtechnology.andM;Sun licenses OpenFonts to individual font suppliers.andP;  Linotype, Monotype,Bigelow andamp; Hplmes, and the Berthold are converting their outline libraries toOpenFonts format.andP;  Currently, there are 627 F3 format fonts available.andP;  Sunprovides 57 fonts with OpenWindows.andM;Openfont technology is part of the converged Sun/AT andamp; T Unix V.4 releasedthis past fall.andP;  This raises some interesting aspects not only to thescrapping over font technology, but to the utilization of X Window as well.andM;Publishers have, in general, seemed a bit dismayed by the swing over to XWindow during the past few years.andP;  X's loose coupling between an applicationand the screen, and especially its provision for only fixed-size, bit-mapfonts, make it ill-suited for some application purposes.andM;The inclusion of OpenFonts provides a workaround.andP;  The application mayrequest any size of font that it likes; Typescaler prepares a bit map forthat size and hands the bit map to the X server so that the server can alwayscarry out the request.andP;  (The X Consortium is working on extensions to the Xcommand set to deal with issues such as providing a list of installed fontbit maps.)andM;NeWS, which is resolution independent, supports scalable fonts directly.andP;  Xis resolution dependent, so the Folio TypeScaler software prepares scaledcharacter bit maps on demand and passes them to X for display on the screen.andO;X thinks it is getting prestored bit-mapped characters.andM;(As an interesting sidenote, Adobe has licensed ATM to Agfa Compugraphics foruse in a future X11/NeWS driver.)andM;Performance.andP;  Performance of any windowing system, but X Window inparticular, is a tough problem.andP;  Performance concerns generally fall in twoareas: mamory requirements and screen performance.andP;  With OpenWindows Version2, Sun has managed improvements in both areas.andM;The server working-set size (the amount of memory used when a set ofapplications is being run) has decreased.andP;  Although the working-set sizevaries with the types of applications being run, Sun ran a comparison usingthe same applications against OpenWindows 1.0 and 2.0 and MIT X11R4 off thetape.andP;  OpenWindows 2 weighed in at 948 KB, against OpenWindows 1.0's 1,724KB.andP;  MIT X11R4 had a working set size of 684 KB for the same applications.andO;This 264 KB delta also includes the presence of the OpenFonts technology andsupport for NeWS.andM;Sun is basically insisting that an 8MB desktop machine would be fine forOpenWindows (especially in a general purpose computing environment that tendsto be more cost concious).andM;OpenWindoes has also made some impressive performance gains from Release 1 toRelease 2.andP;  Sun used the x11perf benchmark (released by Digital through MIT)to measure the speed of graphics operations of OpenWindows 1 and 2 and X11R4on two 16 MB SPARCstation 1+s, one with a graphics accelerator, one in acolor configuration.andM;Performance enhancements are not the sole property of Sun, of course.andP;  OSFhas been working away on Motif (which suffered problems similar to those ofOpenWindows 1.0).andP;  Motif 1.1 now offers gadget-catching and shared librarysupport for a reduction in memory consumption by about 50 percent and anacceleration in performance of about 30 percent.andM;Developer's GuideandM;GUIs may be great for users, but, as we've often pointed out in thispublication, they're giving developers a tough time.andP;  The programming modelsare vastly different, and the GUIs are much more complex.andP;  The bulk of adeveloper's time is spent in fiddling with the interface rather than with themeat of the application.andP;  Sun can't afford to wait.andP;  It needs applications ifit is to realize its vision of delivering a Mac-like environment in Unix.andM;For the reason, Sun has created an interface builder called OpenWindowsDeveloper's Guide (Dev Guide).andP;  While the functionality of the package isquite good, it is the pricing and distribution that we'd like to discussfirst.andM;Sun plans to offer Dev Guide for $250.andP;  Although it is not part of the OS, apackage priced at that level is nearly irresistible.andP;  Sun isn't seeking adirect revenue stream from Dev Guide (as are companies whose sole business isdeveloping such application tools).andP;  Rather, it is trying to create a largethird-party and in-house application set.andM;When it is released, Dev Guide will also be in synch with the currentOpenWindows release.andP;  In other words, there is no lag time between therelease of a GUI upgrade and the ability of a third party to provide abuilder tool that can exploit the new functionality.andP;  OpenWindows and DevGuide march out shoulder to shoulder.andM;FUNCTIONALITY.andP;  With Dev Guide, developers select and position objects on thescreen to create an application interface.andP;  Dev Guide has two basicoperational modes: Build and Test.andP;  In Build mode, developers add, move, anddelete interface objects and edit their properties.andP;  Developers can selectand drag interface object icons with the mouse and drop them in the desiredspot.andP;  Dev Guide offers a palette of icons representing various objects suchas control functions, scrollbars, and menus.andM;Controls and control functions available to the developer include:andM;* A File menu, which contains items used to load, close, and save interfacesand portions of interfaces.andM;* A View menu, which opens up previously dismissed pop-up windows.andM;* An Edit menu, which contains items used to cut, copy, and paste elementswithin and between different interfaces.andM;* A Properties menu, which contains a list of property windows for editingthe properties of individual elements within a user interface.andP;  The propertysheets allow the customization of the object types.andP;  Developers using DevGuide can create applications that exploit the drag-and-drop function offeredby the File Manager.andP;  Dev Guide automatically handles the appropriate codegeneration for drag-and-drop based on the simple setting of one item in aproperties list.andP;  The simplicity of access reportedly has won enthusiasticsupport from developers.andM;* A toggel between Build and Test modes.andP;  In Test mode, the developers canrun the application interface to check its operation.andP;  Testing can occurbefore any code generation and compilation occur.andM;The interface elements Dev Guide offers are:andM;* The Base element glyph, which places a base window on the workspace whenyou drag it thereandM;* The Pop-up glyph, which places a pop-up window on the workspaceandM;* The Controls glyph, which places a control area in an interface when placedin a base or pop-up windowandM;* The Canvas glyph, which places a canvas pane in an interface when placed ina base or pop-up windowandM;* The Term glyph, which places a terminal pane in a windowandM;* The Text pane, which places a text pane in a windowandM;* The Button glyph, which places a button in an interface when placed in acontrol areaandM;* The Message glyph, which places a message in a control areaandM;* The Setting glyph, which places a setting in a control areandM;* The Text Field glyph, which places a text field in a control areaandM;* The Slider glyph, which places a slider in a control areaandM;* The Gauge glyph, which places a gauge in a control areaandM;* The List glyph, which places a scrolling list in a control area.andM;To oversimplify, creating an interface consists of dragging out a basewindow, adding a control area, and then filling in the various components.andM;After saving the interface, the developer must run a companion program, Gxv,to generate source code for the user interface.andP;  Gxv generates five files:andM;* A _ui.c file, which includes statements and an initialization function andcreation function for each element in the window.andP;  This file is the primarysource code file.andM;* A _ui.h file, which contains C externs for each initialization and creationfunction in the _ui.c file and a typedef for the base window.andM;* A _stubs.c file, which contains function templates for each of the handlersset for each element of the base window.andP;  The Notify handler specifies thename of a routine that is called when the user clicks Select.andP;  Gxv puts theNotify handler name in the _stubs.c file.andP;  Filling in the Event handler fieldgenerates the drag-and-drop code as well.andP;  For example, entering &quot;dragproc&quot;into the Event handler field in a property list for an interface file named&quot;dianna&quot; generates the set of code shown in Illustration 10 in the _stubs.cfile.andM;* An info file, which contains help text for each element (all developeradded).andM;* Makefile, which contains information to control the compile.andM;Currently, Dev Guide generates code for XView in standard C (Kernigan andRitchie), ANSI C, or C++.andP;  Dev Guide stores user interfaces in GIL, theGraphical Intermediate Language.andP;  GIL stores an interface without referenceto a specific windowing system or programming language.andP;  All you need is asource code generator that can read the GIL file and generate source code fora particular environment.andP;  In the future, Dev Guide will support OLITT andTNT.andP;  In other words, the same builder front end will define the interfacecode for the three OPEN LOOK toolkits.andM;Sun is making GIL available, so third parties can write their own codegenerator to port programs into different languages and windowingenvironments.andP;  The gotcha is that the environment must support OPEN LOOK.andM;Of course, since XView is now part of SVR4, and since Dev Guide will soon begenerating OLIT (or Xt+)code, Sun and Dev Guide become excellent platformsfor generating applications running in a SVR4 environment.andM;True, Dev Guide isn't as functional as, say, NeXT's Interface Builder.andP;  Nordoes it currently support such obvious wish items as the graphical linking ofinterface to code.andP;  But it does, as we mentioned above, make it easy fordevelopers to create applications that are intergrated into the DeskSetenvironment and that have access to features such as drag-and-drop.andP;  And,considering the price and the potential for consistency of generatedinterfaces across the various OPEN LOOK platforms, we think that DEv Guide isgoing to do exactly what Sun hopes it will: promote more applicationsdevelopment (especially in-house).andM;Internationalization.andP;  Sun also recentlyannounced a Kanji version of DevGuide.andP;  Kanji Dev Guide will enable application developers to writeapplication specifically for the Japanese market.andP;  As with Kanji OpenWindows,Sun sill follow suit with the release of Korean and Chinese versions of DevGuide.andM;CommentsandM;&quot;Wall-of-death&quot; style posturing is, of course, not really in good taste amongmembers of the &quot;Open Systems&quot; community.andP;  Nevertheless, we have detected somesatisfaction among segments of OSF membership companies over Motif's rapidacceptance at the expense of OPEN LOOK.andP;  And truly, for a vendor such as IBMor HP, with a commitment to more than Unix, a consistent interface foundation makes a great ideal of sense.andM;But acceptance is one thing, and implementation is another.andP;  It appears thatnew OPEN LOOK applications are well outpacing Motif applications.andP;  Combiningthose applications with the growing number of SPARC station sales as well asthe promised advent of third-party SPARC implementations, Sun could indeedbecome an entrenched major force in the advanced desktop market.andM;Although the comparison is not an exact one, let's think for a monent aboutthe Macintosh/Windows 3.0 situation.andP;  The highly publicized release ofWindows 3.0 did send some momentary shivers up Mac user spines.andP;  On thesurface of it, Windows offered a great deal--support for the huge hardwarebase, an open systems environment, and so on.andM;Now that the hype has died down, however, the general consensus seems to bethat the Mac is still a better platform, with more consistency and betterperformance.andP;  NIt must have been the positive articles reviewing Windows 3.0that started out by noting that the system &quot;only&quot; crashed a few times thatfirst tipped off the Mac community to the actual state of affairs.)andP;  Becauseit is designed to span a large number of hardware environments, Windows isrunning into some severe compatibility problems.andP;  Windows 3.0 software ispushing &quot;compatible&quot; systems past the point of compatibility.andP;  Rather thangirding themselves for the end of and era, the Mac community is actuallyexpecting an increase in available application opportunities, as somedevelopers turn their sights on the Mac as well as on Windows 3.0 (Now ifApple management can just keep from shooting itself in its collectivefoot...)andM;What Sun is able to offer with Open Windows is that great consistency thatmakes the Macintosh such a usable system.andP;  With SPARC, Sun is able to offer agrowing hardware base that will run those applications.andM;And, cheekily trying to wrest back some of the ground from Motif, SunMicrosystems and UniPress Software incorporated of Edison, new Jersey, haveagreed to offer Sun's XView toolkit on Digital, IBM, and HEwlett-Packard Unixworkstations.andM;(Two can play that game, of course, and Motif will appear on SPARCstations.andO;Count on it.)andM;To answer the multivendor issue further, Sun and others are porting OPEN LOOKtoolkits to 35 different systems.andP;  Integrated Computer Solutions ofCambridge, Massachusetts, is offering XView for A/UX, for examplE.andM;On the technical front, Open Windows raises some interesting challeges andsolutions.andP;  SVR4 offers the combined X Window/NeWS server along with theFolio font technology.andP;  OSF current doesn't have a consistent solution inthat area, leaving it up to implementers.andM;Some X partisans have proposed substantial extensions that would include,among other things, the incorporation of Display Post SCript.andP;  X would lookmore like NeWS.andP;  But then, we would hit the same font technology issue thathas bedeviled the PC industry.andM;Since x and NeWS are present on every SVR4 system, an increasing number ofsoftware developers may quietly slip over to NeWS.andP;  for markets without acommitment to X (such as office applications or publishing), such a defectioncould make a great deal of sense and could further fuel the adoption of Sunas a desktop platform.andM;To summarize:andM;* Sun's own SPARC sales are creating a sizable base to attract developers.andM;* A number of PC and/or Mac applications (such as Informix's WingZ) areappearing using Open Windows.andM;* Sun's strategy of promoting consistent use and easy development within OpenWindows appears to be working.andM;For those who wish it, there are solutions from third parties that allow thegeneration of Motif or OPEN LOOK code (Exocode, for example), as there aredesktops that span multiple windowing environments (such as Looking Glass).andM;But Sun appears to be delivering on its strategy of a single, consistent,desktop-style environment.andP;  Bottom line: We don't think that the interfaceissue is dead as some OSF-ers would like it to be.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
