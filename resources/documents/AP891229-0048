The mission set out to catch the Palestinians who carried outthe massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics butwound up killing a Moroccan-born waiter in Norway in a case ofmistaken identity.   Michael Harari, whose arrest in Panama was reported Thursday,was a security adviser to Noriega and an instructor for PanamanianDefense Forces, according to a U.S. Embassy official in Panama whospoke on condition of anonymity.   Spokesmen for the Israeli foreign and defense ministries refusedcomment today on the arrest, saying Harari was a private citizen.   But the exploits of the 62-year-old former Israeli army colonelhave been described extensively in Israeli newspapers.   The daily Yediot Ahronot said Harari helped Noriega recruitIsraeli mercenaries as his personal bodyguards over the last year.   The newspaper also said a second Israeli, Eliezer Ben Giton,surrendered to U.S. troops outside the Vatican mission in PanamaCity and identified himself as ``responsible for the personalsecurity of Gen. Manuel Noriega.''   U.S. troops invaded Panama on Dec. 20 to seize Noriega and takehim to the United States to stand trial on drug-traffickingcharges. But he eluded capture and took refuge in the Vaticanmission on Sunday.   The independent Haaretz daily said Israel, under strong U.S.pressure to cut contacts with Noriega, convinced Harari to leavePanama last year.   But the former agent with the Israeli Mossad spy agency laterreturned. Haaretz reported that Harari told Israeli officials thatif he did not work with Noriega, his role would be filled by Cubansor Nicaraguans.   Israel's ambassador to Panama, Reuven Ben-Eliezer, told Israelarmy radio in an interview from New York that he had no contactwith Harari.   ``I don't know who Harari is, I didn't see him, I didn't meethim, I didn't get orders from him, and he also didn't receive''orders from Israel's embassy in Panama, Ben-Eliezer said in aninterview recorded Wednesday but first broadcast today.   ``He is a private Israeli. I don't know what he did there. Hedid business and he was appointed by Noriega as honorary generalcounsul for Panama in Israel,'' Ben-Eliezer said.   Yediot described Harari as the former chief of Mossad's specialoperations and said his best-known case was the bungled effort tokill the leader of the Palestinian Black September group thatmassacred 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics.   The case is also described in the book ``The Quest for the RedPrince'' by Israeli authors Michael Bar-Zohar and Eitan Haber.   Haber, now spokesman for Defense Secretary Yitzhak Rabin,refused to comment on the case.   In the book, the team leader is referred to only as ``Mike,''but sources familiar with the case have said it was Harari.   According to the accounts, Harari led a 15-member Mossad hitsquad to kill the Palestinian group's leader, Ali Hassan Salameh.But the chase ended on May 23, 1973, when agents shot and killed awaiter in Lillehammer, Norway.   The incident embarrassed the Mossad and the service's image wasfurther tarnished when six agents and other Israelis involved inthe mission were arrested by Norwegian police.</TEXT></DOC>
