Throughout the following discussion,this part is referred to as ``the regulations.''By revising the regulations, which have been in effect since 1959, we hopeto remove unnecessary restrictions on the interstate movement of plantsand plant products, and to clarify the regulations for persons who mustcomply with them.The following table presents an overview of the organizational changeswe are proposing for Part 302. It graphically indicates the deletions,additions, and redesignations contained in our proposed revision:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,r25</C> <H1>Current section</H1><H1>Proposed section</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">302.1<D>302.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">302.2<D>302.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">302.3<D>Deleted</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">302.4(a) andamp; (b)<D>302.3(a) andamp; (b)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">302.4(c)<D>Deleted</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">302.5<D>302.3(c)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">302.6(a) andamp; (d)<D>Deleted</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">302.6(b) andamp; (c)<D>302.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">N/A<D>302.5</D></ITAG></ITAG>Those proposed changes that alter the regulations in substantive ways are:DefinitionsWe propose to add definitions for the terms ``Administrator,'' ``Infected,''``Infested,'' ``Plant Protection and Quarantine,'' ``PLants and plant products,''``Regulated article,'' ``State,'' ``State plant protection official,''and ``You'' in order to clarify use of these terms in the regulations andincrease understanding and compliance.Under our proposal, the terms ``herbaceous perennial plants, bulbs, androots'' and ``nursery stock'' would not be used in the regulations andtheir current definitions would be merged within the proposed definitionfor ``Plants and plant products.''Our proposed definition of ``Plants and plant products'' includes any partsof woody and herbaceous perennials capable of propagation, <T3>except </T3>seeds. Roots, buds, grafts, bulbs, tubers, and corns needto be inspected, and are therefore included under the definition, becausethey are occasionally taken from uncultivated plants that may be diseased.Seeds do not need to be inspected, and are therefore excluded from thedefinition, because we believe that the seeds used by District of Columbiaresidents are commerically packaged varieties. These seeds are grown incontrolled environments and are subject to close scientific scrutiny andother seed industry safeguards to assure that they are disease-free.We also propose to delete the definition for ``annual plants.'' Our proposedregulations do not contain this term because our experience with annualsmoved into and out of the District of Columbia is that virtually all arehouseplants and backyard vegetable garden plants are grown and maintainedin a manner that precludes their being a medium for the spread of pestsor diseases capable of endangering trees and other perennials in Districtof Columbia parklands.Plants and Plant Products Moved Into DCWe propose to delete the requirement in current andSection; 302.4(c) forinspection of all plants and plant products moved into DC. There is nofarmland or commercial agricultural production for us to protect in DC.Further, the very few serious plant pests or diseases discovered during25 years of inspecting this traffic do not justify the monetary and staffingcosts of our continuing to inspect every domestic plant and plant productshipment entering DC.In order to protect DC's extensive parklands from destructive plant pestsand diseases not currently found in DC, our proposed andSection; 302.3 containscertification and packaging requirements, as well as authority for inspectorsto stop and inspect any vehicles or property that they suspect may containinfested or infected articles.Plants and Plant Products Moved Out of DCWe are also proposing to delete the requirement, in current andSection; 302.6,for certification of nursery stock, herbaceous perennials, bulbs, and rootsmoved out of DC. The only pest of agricutural concern found within DC'sborders is the gypsy moth, and interstate movement of plants and plantparts that might be infested by this pest is already restricted under federalgypsy moth regulations (7 CFR 301.45 <T3>et seq</T3>.).Compliance InformationWe propose to add new andSection;andSection; 302.4 and 302.5 to the regulations.These proposed sections contain information on how and where to obtaincertificates, the need for advance notification when obtaining inspectorservices, and responsibility for costs and charges incident to compliancewith the proposed revision of Part 302.MiscellaneousWe propose to delete current andSection; 302.3. Since any article not specificallynamed in the regulations is unrestricted, we believe that this section'slist of ``unrestricted articles'' is redundant.We have made nonsubstantive changes to present the provisions of this rulemore clearly.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291,and we have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this proposed rulewould have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; would notcause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,federal, state or local government agencies, or geographic regions; andwould not cause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.The primary effect of our proposed revision of the current regulationswould be internal, because it would relieve inspectors of the requirementto perform inspections and certifications that are not necessary to protectagriculture from plant pests or diseases. Eliminating these restrictionswould not, on the other hand, increase trade movements or sales since certificatesare routinely issued for the interstate movement of the articles involved.Any industry savings resulting from elimination of inspections would besmall when measured against the overall production, maintenance, and transportationcosts for these articles.Our remaining proposed changes should simplify and clarify current provisions,rather than significantly altering the existing regulations. If our proposedrevisions were adopted, the volume of plants and plant products movinginto and out of DC would not be changed, we would continue to provide adequateprotection against entry of destructive plant pests and diseases into DC,and we would still make certification services available to those who needthem.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this proposed rule would not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372,which requires intergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.(See 7 CFR 3015, Subpart V).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 302</ITAG>Agricultural commodities, Plant diseases, Plant pests, Plants (Agriculture),Quarantine, Transportation.Accordingly, we propose to revise Part 302 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 302_DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: MOVEMENT OF PLANTS AND PLANT PRODUCTS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">302.1 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">302.2 Restrictions and prohibitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">302.3 Movement of plants and plant products into the District of Columbia.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">302.4 Issuance of certificates.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">302.5 Costs and charges.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>7 U.S.C. 150dd, 150ee, 150ff, 161, 162, and 164-167;7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(c).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 302.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>In this part, the following definitions apply:<T3>Administrator. </T3>The Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service or any employee of the United States Department of Agricultureto whom the Administrator has delegated authority to act in his or herstead.<T3>Certificate. </T3>A document issued by an inspector for a regulatedarticle, representing that the article has been inspected and found freeof injurious plant pests and diseases and that it may be moved interstateto any destination.<T3>Infected. </T3>The presence of a destructive plant disease or the existenceof circumstances that make it reasonable for an inspector to believe thata destructive plant disease is present.<T3>Infested. </T3>The presence of a destructive plant pest or the existenceof circumstances that make it reasonable for an inspector to believe thata destructive plant pest is present.<T3>Inspector. </T3>Any employee of Plant Protection and Quarantine, Animaland Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, authorizedby the Administrator to enforce the provisions of this part.<T3>Moved. </T3>Shipped, offered for shipment to a common carrier, receivedfor transportation or transported by a common carrier, or carried, transported,moved, or allowed to be moved by any means.<T3>Plant Protection and Quarantine. </T3>Plant Protection and Quarantine,Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.<T3>Plants and plant products. </T3>Woody and herbaceous perennials, suchas trees, shrubs, vines, and other plants having persistent above-the-groundwoody stems or whose roots persist 2 or more years.
