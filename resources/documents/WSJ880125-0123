A federal jury in Manhattan said that if a customer signs an arbitration agreement, but doesn't read and understand what he signs, he doesn't have to submit the claims to arbitration.    The decision appears to provide a way around a June ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that said that securities-fraud claims under federal securities and anti-racketeering laws must be resolved by arbitration if required by a signed agreement between a broker and investor.    Securities industries officials assert, however, that the jury ruling was improper and won't be much help to other unhappy customers.    The dispute involves an investor, Stockton Rush, who filed suit in 1984 against Oppenheimer andamp; Co., his broker, alleging he lost $400,000 through unauthorized and fraudulent transactions.    Oppenheimer, a unit of New York-based Oppenheimer Financial Corp., demanded that the case be submitted for arbitration, as required by an agreement Mr. Rush signed. But Mr. Rush said he deserved a jury trial instead of arbitration because he hadn't actually read the arbitration agreement that he signed.    Mr. Rush, who was 19 and a Princeton University student when he opened the account, has since graduated from Princeton and works as an aeronautical engineer for an aerospace firm. He is now 25.    Resolution of the original dispute has been held up while the court decided where the case belonged. A three-day jury trial was held last week in U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet's court to decide that matter.    At that trial, Mr. Rush contended that although he had signed the arbitration agreement, he didn't read it because his broker allegedly tossed it off as a &quot;formality.&quot; His broker at Oppenheimer contended that he told Mr. Rush to read the agreement carefully before signing it.    Because Mr. Rush persuaded the jury that he hadn't read the agreement, he will be allowed a civil trial instead of arbitration before a private panel.    Oppenheimer's general counsel, Robert Kleinberg, said that the firm's broker did tell Mr. Rush to read the document, and added, &quot;the man is a Princeton graduate. I think juniors at Princeton know how to read a document.&quot;    Lawyers representing investors have generally favored going to civil court, believing it may be easier to persuade a jury than an arbitrator to sympathize with a person who has lost funds. Lawyers for brokerage firms have generally preferred arbitration, which takes place primarily before fact finders appointed by the various national stock exchanges or the National Association of Securities Dealers.    Christopher Lovell, Mr. Rush's lawyer, said the case &quot;means that the Supreme Court decision (in June) doesn't give brokerage firms of the New York Stock Exchange the power to abolish the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution, guaranteeing jury trials for civil cases. Any customer who doesn't want to agree to arbitration doesn't have to.&quot;    Martin Gold, a lawyer for Oppenheimer, said &quot;the way the judge sent the case to the jury was contrary to the intentions of the Supreme Court.&quot; Mr. Gold said he intends to file a motion recommending that the verdict be set aside. William Fitzpatrick, general counsel for the Securities Industry Association, supported Mr. Gold's view. Mr. Fitzpatrick disputed that the ruling constituted a loophole. The question of where to hear the case should go to an arbitration panel, he asserted.    &quot;It's a complete, absolute suppressing of the federal arbitration laws&quot; to let a jury decide if the complaint should go to arbitration. If Oppenheimer files an appeal, &quot;they'll probably ask us to go in as a friend of the court, and in all probability we will join them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
