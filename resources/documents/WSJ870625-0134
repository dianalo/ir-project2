The reappointment of the 57-year-old Bundesbank chief was widely expected, despite some criticism of his expansive monetary policies at home.    The Bundesbank has been walking a narrow line between international demands for more West German economic growth and domestic fears of rekindling inflation. A switch from Mr. Poehl, whose current term expires in December, could have upset the balance, some analysts believed.    &quot;Another choice to head the Bundesbank would have sent out the wrong signal abroad and could have brought increasing difficulty in communications among the world monetary powers,&quot; said Richard D.G. Reid, senior European economist for Phillips andamp; Drew in London. &quot;In the forseeable future, Mr. Poehl will be balancing between maintaining monetary credibility in West Germany without giving other governments the impression he is inducing a recession.&quot;    The cabinet also reappointed Helmut Schlesinger, 62 years old, as the Bundesbank's vice president and chief economist. Mr. Schlesinger, whose monetary views are perceived as less flexible than Mr. Poehl's, will serve an abbreviated term lasting through 1992, when he will reach mandatory retirement age.    Mr. Poehl's extended mandate will make him the longest-serving central-bank chief among leading industrialized democracies once Paul Volcker departs from the U.S. Federal Reserve in August. Mr. Volcker took office in mid-1979, just six months before Mr. Poehl assumed his post in January 1980 under the Social Democratic government of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.    Mr. Poehl's membership in the left-wing party grated on some members of Chancellor Kohl's center-right Christian Democratic Union. The Bundesbank enjoys constitutional autonomy, but its president is still named by the ruling government. An initiative to replace Mr. Poehl never got off the ground when a quick search uncovered no suitable candidates with Mr. Poehl's experience and international prominence. What's more, Mr. Poehl was able to count on the support of a powerful ally in Bonn, Chancellor Kohl's influential finance minister, Gerhard Stoltenberg.    Since early 1986, the Bundesbank has steered an expansive monetary course and provided for broad liberalization of West Germany's financial markets, culminating in May, when it lowered the rate charged on its securities-repurchase agreements to help widen the gap between West German and U.S. interest rates in an effort to support the dollar.    On the surface, the moves appeared to satisfy calls by U.S. policy makers for West German moves to stimulate growth and thereby increase imports. But Mr. Poehl has stressed that the principal motive has been to support the sagging dollar on currency markets.    Mr. Poehl's pragmatism has often drawn objections from within his own Central Bank Council, where there is a fear that unbridled monetary growth could fuel inflation. West Germany's inflation rate in May stood at only 0.2%. But economists estimate that, excluding lower import prices, which have been cut by the mark's appreciation, the underlying domestic inflation rate is closer to 2%. The calculation is seen as signaling an inflationary trend that could spell an end to Mr. Poehl's expansive push that has brought West German interest rates to near-historic lows.    Indeed, yesterday, the Bundesbank said the nation's broad-based and seasonally adjusted M-3 money supply rose by 8.5 billion West German marks ($4.63 billion), or at a 6.9% annual rate, to 1.052 trillion marks in May.    The rate of growth slowed from 7.6% in April, but was higher than the 6.1% rate in May 1986. M-3 consists of cash, sight deposits, time deposits under four years, and savings accounts. </TEXT></DOC>
