About 900 soldiers of the Burmese army seized the Klerday campWednesday night following a series of attacks on peripheral Karenoutposts, officials said. Klerday is in Burma, opposite the Thaidistrict of Tha Song Yang in Tak.   The officials said hundreds of armed Karens fled to areassoutheast of the fallen camp, where the guerrillas hoped to regroup.   At Klerday, Burmese ground troops fired mortar shells and setablaze 80 thatched homes, according to rebels' accounts.   From the Thai side, smoke was seen for miles some 10 hours afterthe incident, a Thai journalist at the border reported.   Earlier Wednesday, government troops overran two small bases,forcing a number of the Karen rebels to retreat to Klerday. TheKaren National Union fields 4,000 guerrillas and is regarded as thestrongest of a dozen ethnic rebel organizations fighting the Rangoongovernment for greater autonomy.   A Karen fighter later told The Associated Press that 700reinforcement units arrived too late at Klerday. He spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Mong Chi, 40, a Karen civilian who crossed into Thailand, said:``These attacks by the Burmese troops were the heaviest in years.''   ``A thousand mortar shells crashed inside and around the camp,forcing evacuations everywhere,'' he said. ``(There was) no refugeeven in bunkers.''   Theng Tun, 27, said Burmese troops overran the camp and thenwithdrew because they feared retaliation when darkness fell.   Thai Border Patrol Police who tried to prevent the 600 Karensfrom entering Thailand said they saw five Karen teen-agers with M-16automatic rifles try to cross rapids in the Moei River. All fivewere feared drowned, they said.   Thai authorities are allowing the refugees to remain on the Thaiside of the Moei River, which forms the boundary, but will not letthem move deeper into Thailand. Tak is 230 miles northwest ofBangkok.   Recently, the Burmese army has stepped up its attacks on theKarens, retaking the vital border village of Mae Tha Waw anddisrupting the rebels' main revenue source _ a lucrative smugglingtrade between Burma and Thailand.</TEXT></DOC>
