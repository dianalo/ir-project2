(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker, the television evangelist wholost his PTL empire in a sex and money scandal, was sentenced to 45years in prison and fined $500,000 today for a federal fraud andconspiracy conviction.   ``I'm deeply sorry for those I have hurt,'' Bakker said beforehe was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter. ``Ihave sinned. But never in my life did I intend to defraud.''   Neither side presented witnesses during the hearing, which beganat 2 p.m. and ended shortly after 3 p.m. Bakker rose with hisattorney, Harold Bender, when Potter sentenced him.   Bakker shook his head in disbelief while a federal prosecutorpresented arguments, as did his daughter, Tammy Sue Chapman.Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye, did not attend the court session.   Bakker could be eligible for parole in 10 years. He wasimmediately taken into custody and was to be taken to the federalcorrectional facility in Talladega, Ala. His lawyers have saidsince his conviction that they would appeal.   Jessica Hahn, the church secretary whose sexual tryst withBakker led to the hush money scandal that caused him to losecontrol of PTL in 1987, said in a television interview that she wasnot satisfied with the sentence.   ``In my opinion, I still feel like it won't add up to the yearsthat people worked to save up money to give to PTL.''   Bakker, 49, was convicted Oct. 5 of 24 counts charging hedefrauded followers of his television ministry, selling lodgingguarantees at his Christian retreat when he knew rooms weren'tavailable.   Followers sent more than $158 million to become ``lifetimepartners,'' which was supposed to give them annual lodging rightsfor the rest of their lives.   The jury found that Bakker used more than $3.7 million to buyluxurious homes, fancy cars, jewelry and expensive vacations.   In a sentencing memo, Justice Department fraud specialistDeborah Smith and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller asked Potterthat Bakker be ordered to pay restitution. Unsettled claims totalbetween $90 million to $100 million, according to lawyersrepresenting the partners.   Prosecutors said when Bakker was indicted that the maximum finecould be more than $5 million. But when they filed therecommendation, they cited the Criminal Fine Enforcement Act of1984, which allows a maximum fine to be no more than twice thehighest fine allowed for any count in the case.   Since Bakker faced 21 counts carrying maximum $250,000 fines andthree carrying maximum $1,000 fines, the memo said the highest finePotter, known as ``Maximum Bob'' for his stiff sentences, could setwas $500,000.   Bakker faced a maximum sentence of 120 years. The memorandum didnot specify a recommended sentence but cited a number of cases.Prosecutors said in the memo the sentence should be more than thelongest of those cases, which was 40 years.   ``Every time there was a fork in the road and one led to alighter sentence and one led to a heavier sentence, Jim took theone that led to the heavier sentence,'' former U.S. Attorney MikeScofield said before the sentencing. ``When Jim got on thecourthouse steps and said he was not guilty and showed a completelack of remorse and contrition that's going to hurt him. That meansa lot to Judge Potter.''   Prosecutors said a tough prison sentence would show thatwhite-collar criminals ``will not be dealt with less harshly thanthose criminals who have neither the wit nor the position to commitcrimes other than those of violence.''   The prosecutors said Bakker has not assumed responsibility forhis crimes.   ``The defendant's lack of remorse suggests little potential formeaningful rehabilitation and demonstrates an increased likelihoodof recidivism,'' the prosecutors wrote. ``Since leaving PTL, Bakkerhas shown a willingness to continue his solicitation of supportthrough the use of half truths and misrepresentations. ...   ``A substantial term of imprisonment would impress upon thedefendant the gravity of his offenses and the need to refrain fromsimilar conduct in the future,'' the prosecutors said.   Bender attached character references from Bakker supporters tohis three-page sentencing recommendation and urged the judge toconsider alternatives to prison.   Bender asked the court to ``temper its justice with mercy andconsider reasonable alternatives and allow this defendant thebenefit of the court's compassion and mercy.''   During the trial, which began Aug. 28 and lasted nearly sixweeks, defense attorneys had called 75 witnesses, including morethan 50 who were loyal Bakker supporters.   Prosecutors called more than 100 witnesses, including manylifetime partners who had sent money _ usually $1,000 _ to obtainfree mini-vacations at PTL's 2,400-acre Christian retreat in nearbyFort Mill, S.C.</TEXT></DOC>
