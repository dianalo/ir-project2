Sherrie Rollins, an ABC News executive who is married toRepublican political consultant Edward Rollins, will becomean assistant to the president for public liaison andintragovernmental affairs, White House officials confirmed.The liaison operation, which handles relations withconstituency groups, and intragovernmental affairs were movedfrom the domain of Communications Director David Demarest,who will now focus exclusively on the speech-writingdepartment, officials said.</LP><TEXT>   Since assuming his post last month, Mr. Skinner hasemphasized improved communications as a key to restoring Mr.Bush's political standing. But his choice for a newcommunications czar, veteran Republican operative James Lake,declined the position because he was unwilling to sever hisprivate business ties.   Ms. Rollins was deputy communications director for RonaldReagan's 1984 re-election campaign, and later was an aide toHousing Secretary Jack Kemp before joining ABC. Her husbandheaded the National Republican Congressional Committee untilhe broke with the administration over Mr. Bush's support fortax increases in the 1990 deficit-reduction agreement withCongress.   &quot;I'm very pleased that she could overcome the disadvantageof being my wife,&quot; Mr. Rollins said.</TEXT></DOC>
