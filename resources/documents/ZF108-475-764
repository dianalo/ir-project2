 It also preserves more of the pageformat than OmniText does.andM;Both programs achieve greater speed and accuracy when scanning a photocopyinstead of an original, but you'll still need a good spelling checker toclean up the results.andM;AccuText 1.1andM;AccuText is an automatic, omnifont OCR program built on a squad of expertsystems that combine shape and context analysis, working from a lexicon ofcorrect word spellings, common word endings, and probable letter and numbersequences.andP;  Its forte is reading poorly copied, multipage documents.andM;Pros: Can read poor-quality prints and photocopies.andP;  Has Preview window formanually selecting and arranging blocks of text to recognize.andP;  Preserves moreof a page's format than OmniPage.andM;Cons: Slower and less accurate on most pages than OmniPage.andP;  No built-ineditor for viewing recognized text before saving to a file.andM;Requires: SE with 68020 accelerator card, or SE/30 or later with 4 megabytesof RAM (5 megabytes under MultiFinder) and a 20-megabyte hard-disk drive.andO;System 6.0 or later, Finder 6.1 or later, and MultiFinder 6.0.andM;List Price: $799.andM;Xerox Imaging Systems, Inc., 535 Oakmead Parkway, Sunnyvale, CA 94086; (800)248-6550.andM;OmniPage 2.1 1/2andM;OmniPage is an automatic, omnifont OCR program.andP;  It can read a wide range ofdocuments, but it works best on complex magazine pages.andP;  Its strict adherenceto shape analysis -- without AccuText's dependence on lexicons -- avoids mostsubstitution errors.andP;  You can extend its use with the optional programsOmniSpell, OmniDraft, OmniProof, and OmniTrace.andM;Pros: Fast and accurate on most pages.andP;  Supports more scanners, languages,and output file formats than AccuText.andP;  Is able to read pages placed in or ona scanner at an angle.andP;  Optional programs provide context analysis, documentcomparison, dotmatrix-print recognition, and conversion of bit-mappedgraphics to object graphics.andM;Cons: Not good on poor-quality prints and copies; little manual control oftextblock shape, position, or recognition order; preserves little of adocument's format; requires a page to be scanned twice to save text andgraphics.andM;Requires: SE with 68020 accelerator card, or SE/30 or later with 4 megabytesof RAM (5 megabytes under MultiFinder).andP;  System 4.2 or later.andM;List Price: $795.andM;Caere Corp., 100 Cooper Court, Los Gatos, CA 95030; (800) 535-7226.andM;A lot of the information that people want is already in print somewhere -- ina book, magazine, newspaper, or report.andP;  The problem is getting theinformation off the page and into your Mac, ready to be edited, analyzed,tweaked, and processed.andP;  What you need is a way to convert spots of ink on apage into bits of electricity in a chip.andP;  What you need is optical characterrecognition, or OCR.andM;OCR enables computers to &quot;read&quot; documents by optically scanning a page andthen finding and identifying the characters on that page.andP;  The result is aneditable word-processor or spreadsheet file.andM;Early OCR programs for the Macintosh were designed with rigid rules thatallowed them to recognize only a very few fonts, type styles, and sizes.andO;Then came &quot;trainable&quot; OCR, which you could teach to recognize almost any fontby showing it what typical characters looked like (see the &quot;Trainable OCR&quot;sidebar).andP;  These programs use pattern matching, isolating a possiblecharacter and overlaying it with a known character pattern until a match ismade -- a process similar to comparing fingerprints.andM;Automatic, or &quot;omnifont,&quot; OCR was the next step.andP;  These programs don't needto be trained to recognize particular fonts or styles (hence omnifont).andO;Instead, they work with more-general rules and can recognize characters in avariety of type sizes and styles by means of a cluster of algorithms.andM;The algorithms behind these rules come from artificial-intelligence research.andO;They compare the dot patterns on a page with their stored knowledge aboutcharacter shapes.andP;  Instead of the strict pattern matching of a trainable OCRprogram, omnifont OCR programs extract and then analyze a character'sfeatures.andP;  That is, instead of depending on exact matches with storedpatterns, they have a general understanding that a P, for instance, has avertical stroke and an enclosed area on the top right of the stroke.andP;  Suchunderstanding isn't stumped by changes in type style or size.andM;Based on such feature analysis, an omnifont program can make an educatedguess at a character's identity.andP;  More-advanced omnifont OCR programs includepage- or document-recognition software that can recognize page layout,distinguish text from graphics, and grasp the format of the text (see the&quot;High-End Systems&quot; sidebar).andM;AccuText from Xerox Imaging Systems and OmniPage from Caere are the majorplayers in automatic OCR.andP;  Both programs are designed to look at a page andrecognize some format details: They can distinguish between graphics andtext; and within the text, they can recognize columns, headlines, and titles.andM;However, AccuText and OmniPage have somewhat different strengths.andP;  OmniPageis optimized to recognize high-quality print, such as complex magazine pagesthat contain several fonts, graphic elements, and irregular columns.andM;AccuText works best with longer, poorly printed documents, such as second-andthird-generation photocopies.andP;  It was designed to tackle multipage documents,such as manuals and financial reports.andM;Context versus Feature AnalysisandM;The two programs approach page recognition from different angles.andP;  OmniPagefits a whole scanned page into RAM and starts by squinting at the page tofind and peel away graphics; it then locates column edges, line spaces(including variable spaces containing large initial caps), and characters.andO;Each isolated character is put into a box, and its shape and features areanalyzed.andP;  If the character's identity isn't obvious, it's rotated in the boxand retested.andM;As characters are identified, OmniPage adds them to a pool of learnedcharacters, which speeds up recognition.andP;  It then makes a second pass at thepage, returning to tough characters and using what it has learned to try tocrack their identities.andP;  When OmniPage can't recognize a character, itsubstitutes a special symbol, usually a tilde (~), in the output file.andM;OmniPage doesn't make guesses based on word context.andP;  In other words, itdoesn't refer to a dictionary and then speculate on a character's identity byits context within a word.andP;  As a result, OmniPage seldom substitutes thewrong character in a word; instead it inserts the unknown-character symbolwherever it isn't sure.andP;  It's then a simple process to search for unknowncharacters and fix them, using a word processor's spelling checker.andM;AccuText begins its analysis by examining an entire page, much as OmniPagedoes.andP;  As it moves through the page, it learns the text shapes and adjustsits recognition, based on new information.andP;  It learns from clearly printedsections of the page what characters look like and then applies thatknowledge to areas that are not printed as clearly.andP;  AccuText recognizes theeasy marks early on and postpones the tough guesses until it knows more aboutthe page.andM;AccuText uses a multilevel expert system for page segmentation, characterrecognition, and format analysis.andP;  The character-recognition expert hasseveral parts.andP;  One works on well-formed character's geometric properties.andO;Another uses learned information about the page to separate touchingcharacters -- realizing, for instance, that the letter pair in is too wide tobe a single m.andP;  AccuText also has an expert system to deal with characterattributes such as italics, underlining, superscript, and subscript.andM;A large part of AccuText's intelligence comes from its lexicons --dictionaries of properly spelled words and probable character sequences --available in seven languages.andP;  The English lexicon contains 50,000 words(more if you add your own user lexicon) and syntax rules, such as likely wordendings, and letter/number combinations, such as 1990s and 1st.andP;  These syntaxrules help AccuText guess the probable identity of questionable characters.andM;AccuText's lexicon checking gives it a stronger tendency than OmniPage tosubstitute incorrect characters.andP;  It also makes AccuText run more slowly,because it's trying harder to make sense of difficult characters.andP;  On amagazine page, this results in AccuText's recognizing headlines or headingsover columns -- styles of text that don't offer many examples for learningand comparing on a single page.andM;Because AccuText is designed to deal with long documents, it sees and learnsfrom a larger text sample than does OmniPage.andP;  This means, however, that itcan be prone to committing errors in short documents.andM;OmniPage also offers context-based recognition through an optional productcalled OmniSpell.andP;  Still in beta at press time, OmniPage with OmniSpell isdesigned to look at all the recognized words in a document and compare themwith a dictionary stored on-disk.andP;  It can then change a questionablecharacter's identity within a word to match a dictionary entry as well asreport how many words will change in this way.andP;  You can then make all thechanges at once or pick through them interactively.andM;OmniSpell can also build a user dictionary of proper names and technicalterms for a document -- either interactively or by importing a text file --and it can export its user dictionary for use with other spelling checkers.andM;FORMATandM;Working on the assumption that users are more interested in the informationcontained within a document than in its layout, OmniPage doesn't replicate apage's exact layout.andP;  Although it can automatically recognize multiplecolumns on a page, it doesn't report the results in the same format.andP;  Forinstance, OmniPage reports side-by-side columns in the original document assequential columns in the final output.andM;AccuText holds on to more of a document's format than OmniPage does.andP;  It caneven create style sheets for Microsoft Word.andP;  When faced with keeping thefile as easily editable as possible or forcing it to look like the original,however, AccuText opts for editability.andP;  For instance, AccuText can reproducea table's format with tab stops between columns, but it cannot include anyadditional spaces that even out on-screen character spacings and positions.andM;FeaturesandM;AccuText's settings and menus are more focused and economical than areOmniPage's.andP;  You can specify column settings, page settings, and recognitionsettings, such as numbers only, letters only, or alphanumeric.andP;  You can alsodecide whether or not to use context verification.andP;  You can save scannersettings, such as those for brightness and resolution, in a file on-disk.andM;One of AccuText's best features is its Preview window, which lets youcustomize settings for different areas of a document, as well as choose howmuch of the page to scan.andP;  Unfortunately, these settings can't be saved as atemplate.andP;  Final text output can be saved as Microsoft Word, MacWrite, text,or Excel files, and scanned images can be saved as TIFF, MacPaint, or PICTfiles.andM;You have to deal with twice as many menus in OmniPage.andP;  The Defaults menuoffers choices for 11 European languages, 17 scanner models, contrast, size,scanner resolution and tone, and scan area, as well as text defaults.andP;  Youcan also choose whether to display statistics on accuracy at the end of thefile.andP;  One nice feature that OmniPage offers is the capacity to &quot;invert&quot; thedata (print white on a black background).andM;OmniPage's Preview window allows you to zoom in or out to view text orgraphics, which is useful for checking your scanner settings but doesn'tallow you to limit the scanning area.andM;When OmniPage has read each page, it places the results in its TransitionalEdit window, which offers search-and-replace commands and an error-checkingoption for finding and manually fixing recognition errors.andP;  Finished filescan be saved as text, MacWrite, Microsoft Word, WordPerfect, or Excel files.andO;Images can be saved as PICT, MacPaint, or TIFF images.andM;In addition to OmniSpell (mentioned earlier) for context verification,OmniPage also has several optional add-on programs: OmniDraft for low-qualitydot-matrix prints; OmniProof to compare documents; and OmniTrace, whichconverts bit maps to PostScript graphics.andM;OmniProof can show you how two versions of the same document differ, and itcan generate summary reports of the differences, which is useful in testingthe accuracy of your OCR files.andP;  OmniTrace inserts itself into OmniPage asanother menu option.andP;  It converts bit-mapped and TIFF files into EPSF filesthat can use Bezier curves and vectors.andM;PerformanceandM;Automatic OCR is a difficult process, and it demands some powerful hardware:You'll need at least an SE with 4 megabytes of RAM and a hard-disk drive.andO;Both AccuText and OmniPage are designed to drive a scanner directly and torecognize the files produced as well as to translate TIFF files created orcaptured elsewhere.andM;A surprising difference between the programs is how they handle multipagedocuments.andP;  With AccuText, you must respond to a prompt after every sheet,whereas OmniPage handles the pages without interruption.andP;  Yet AccuText issupposedly designed for multipage work.andM;Because it learns as it goes, AccuText should accelerate while working on along, homogeneous document.andP;  When MacUser Labs charted both programs for rateper page, however, there was no clear trend: Neither OmniPage nor AccuTextgets noticeably faster over the length of a document.andM;Comparing PerformanceandM;To justify its cost, an OCR program should be faster and more accurate than atypist.andP;  Measuring a program's speed and accuracy depends on the complexityof the document you're asking it to read, including such aspects as the paperit's printed on and the layout, type size, and skew angle.andM;In our tests, OmniPage was usually faster than AccuText and won most of theaccuracy comparisons.andP;  It was more skew-resistant, keeping its accuracy evenwhen a page was angled by as much as 5 degrees -- AccuText's accuracy droppedprecipitously with such a skew.andP;  There were a few cases in which AccuTextmatched OmniPage's time, however, and poor-quality pages, such as darkphotocopies and fax copies particularly, hurt OmniPage's accuracy far morethan AccuText's (see Figure 1).andM;In general, the tests showed that both programs fare better with photocopiesof pages than with originals -- possibly because the photocopy smooths lines,connects neighboring dots, and reduces glare from the page surface.andM;Both programs had difficulty recognizing equations, and neither could producean acceptable result when scanning a technical document with equations.andO;OmniPage was twice as fast as AccuText when scanning the technical document,and it had slightly better overall accuracy, but AccuText was better atcatching subscripts (see Figure 2).andM;On a simple magazine page with few graphic or text elements, both programsfailed to deliver an accurate rendition, and AccuText took more than tenminutes to do a poor job.andP;  OmniPage was more accurate, but AccuText kept thetext blocks in order better.andP;  Changing the scanner settings for brightnessand contrast didn't improve either program's accuracy.andP;  A competent typistcould sit at the keyboard and key in a page faster and more accurately thanthis.andP;  Both programs worked better with a photocopy of the page, withOmniPage reaching reasonable accuracy in a little more than half the timeAccuText took.andM;On the complex magazine page -- with three columns wrapped around circularand angled graphics -- both programs took the same amount of time.andP;  AlthoughOmniPage delivered a lower error count, it had more trouble distinguishinggraphics that were placed close to the text (see Figure 3).andM;On legal documents, both programs did a good job, although they had sometrouble keeping the line numbers on the left separated from the rest of thetext.andP;  AccuText was actually slightly faster than OmniPage -- consistent withXerox's claims that longer documents produce better results -- but it deleteda dozen words (see Figure 4).andM;On a 20-page document, OmniPage was faster, averaging 57 characters persecond; AccuText averaged only 32.andP;  But OmniPage had some 10 seconds per pageof overhead, whereas AccuText gave up only 5 seconds per page.andM;On average, OmniPage won on speed and AccuText came out slightly ahead onaccuracy.andP;  However, OmniPage's accuracy suffered severely when it worked withpoor-quality prints, such as dot-matrix, fax, and dark photocopies, andAccuText's speed was affected when dealing with complex documents, such asscientific or technical documents.andM;Whichever OCR program suits you best, arm yourself with a good spellingchecker and don't expect 100-percent accuracy or a perfect replica of youroriginal document.andP;  OCR can be practical, but it isn't yet perfect.andM;Trainable OCRandM;If you're going to scan a lot of text with only a few fonts, a trainable OCRprogram can be your best choice.andM;After some practice, trainable OCR programs can recognize almost any font.andO;You show the program what a font's typical characters look like by workingthrough a sample page -- this is an a, this is an f, this is another a, thisis a comma.andP;  Training can take anywhere from 15 minutes to a couple of hours.andM;Trainable programs demand less system hardware than automatic programs do --they can work on any Mac with 1 megabyte of RAM -- and if you're willing toset aside some training time, you can achieve speedier scanning and betteraccuracy than with automatic OCR programs.andM;TextPert 3.01 isn't the easiest program to train, but it does support a widerange of languages and alphabets, and it has some of the most flexiblefile-input and -output options of any trainable OCR package.andM;Version 3.5, scheduled for release after press time, offers better speed andgreater accuracy through new algorithms, more scanner drivers, and improveddot-matrix reading.andP;  TextPert also allows you to easily exportdatabase-format files.andM;ReadStar II Plus 1.06 can be confusing to train, and it has limitedfile-import and -export choices.andP;  It needs 2 megabytes of RAM and iscopy-protected.andP;  Once it's trained, however, ReadStar is very fast, beatingmost of the trainable and automatic programs.andM;TextScan 3.04, one of the least expensive OCR programs, comes with adictionary and pretrained character tables.andP;  It can work on PICT files, andversion 3.04 provides better dot-matrix recognition than earlier versionsdid.andM;Read-It! OCR 2.1 is inexpensive and easy to train, has lots of editing andtraining options, and runs in the background under MultiFinder, but it isn'tparticularly fast or accurate.andM;Version 3.0, to be shipped in the third quarter of 1990, will add automaticgraphics-and text-separation capabilities and character-recognition featuresfor typical office documents.andP;  It should also be considerably faster.andM;ReadForm, a superset of Read-It! OCR, will also ship in the third quarter.andO;It will be able to scan and recognize typewritten and block-text handwritingon typical office forms and output the results into database format.andM;Olduvai Corp. 7520 Red Road, Suite A South Miami, FL 33143 (800) 822-0772ReadForm, $695 Read-It!
