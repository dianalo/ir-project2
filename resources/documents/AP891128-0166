East Germany has increasingly discussed the possibility of aconfederation, but the Communist nation's leader, Egon Krenz, ruledout any talk of reunification.   ``A unity of Germany isn't on the agenda,'' Krenz told WestGermany's ARD-TV network in insisting on the continued existence oftwo ``sovereign, independent German states.''   There are fears among Europeans in the East and the West aboutthe political and economic power of a reunified Germany with 80million people.   Kohl, in a speech to Parliament, sought to allay those fears,saying: ``The Germans ... will be a dividend for a Europe that iscoming together, and never again a threat.''   The United States favors reunification, and State Departmentspokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler reiterated that position inWashington on Tuesday. The Soviet Union has said the idea is``dangerous and unrealistic.''   Kohl said he had no timetable in mind to carry out his ideas andmade it clear it could take years to form a federation. He said hehoped to discuss his proposals with East German leaders at a summit``before Christmas.'' On Monday, his spokesman, Hans Klein, saidthe meeting might be held on Dec. 19.   East German government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said Kohl's planin general provided ``interesting starting points fornegotiations.''   But writer Stefan Heym and a number of other East Germanartists, clerics and intellectuals rejected reunification, sayingthey opposed their country ``being pocketed'' by West Germany. Thegroup said it would start a petition drive in support of its appeal.   Kohl's proposals were the most thorough delineation he has madeyet of his vision of ending the division of Germany imposed afterWorld War II.   Earlier, Hans-Jochen Vogel, the leader of the opposition SocialDemocrats, proposed an eventual confederation as a step towardunity.   In the past, the Social Democrats have cautioned againsthastening toward German reunification; some in the leftist partyhave flatly opposed it.   ``We are now standing at the start of a new period in Europeanand German history, a period that points beyond the status quo orthe hitherto political structures in Europe,'' Kohl told Parliament.   ``We are prepared ... to develop confederative structuresbetween the two states in Germany in order to create a federation,a federal state in Germany.''   A federation is a union of states with a central government; aconfederation is an alliance of independent nations for a commonpurpose.   Kohl also said reunification must be ``bedded in thepan-European process and in East-West relations. The futurestructure of Germany must fit into the whole architecture of Europeas a whole.''   He said his proposal could only be carried out if East Germanyholds free elections, as it has promised.   The chancellor proposed creation of joint governmental andparliamentary committees for ``permanent consultation'' between theGermanys.   He also suggested such committees to deal with economic,environmental, cultural and scientific matters, and he said theycould be set up soon after free elections in East Germany.   Kohl said West Germany is prepared to offer ``concreteassistance'' to embattled East Germany, where it is urgently needed.   But he said massive assistance would be contingent on EastGermany ``irreversibly'' setting into motion ``a fundamental changeof its political and economic system.''   East Germany has rejected previous demands that it replace itsplanned economy with a market-oriented one.   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said in Brussels,Belgium, that Kohl's proposal for reunification was compatible withthe Western alliance's vision of a future Europe.   The plan ``links the development of the German future to thelarger process of building Europe and to the existing institutionsof the West,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
