 A series of well-attendedseminars conducted by the Business USA forum specially set up for CeBIT, madeit plain that the CoCom list had not only stunted East-West businessrelations, but also had further negative ramifications for trading betweenthe US and Western Europe.andM;IllicitandM;The French foreign trade minister, Jean-Marie Rausch, asserted that Francewas committed to work with West Germany in the rebuilding of Eastern Europe,and that the crucial factor in this rebuilding was &quot;to change the CoCom listas soon as possible&quot;.andP;  Eastern business fervently hopes for these changes aswell, but there was also the realisation that the expected relaxation of theCoCom lists may come too late, for by the time their developers start to comeout with new products based on previously restricted technology, they couldfind their traditional markets in the hands of the many Western firms alreadyvying for a piece of the action.andP;  Nevertheless, nobody who talked to theEastern European firms at CeBIT could have avoided sympathising with theirdespair at watching their hopelessly out-dated products being pitilesslyeclipsed by the Western European and US offerings exhibited under the sameroof, and although CeBIT offers the Comecon companies the bitter-sweet chanceto see at first hand the state of advancement in the rest of the world and toget some perspective on the world market, the imbalance created by CoCom -resulting in East German information technology, for example, being aboutfive years behind that across the border - means that when they are allowedan illicit opportunity to get to grips with Western technology moreintimately, it is rarely turned down.andP;  Three years ago, Isotimpex, theBulgarian computer and peripherals manufacturer and electronic componentstrade agency for the country as a whole, was indirectly caught up in a messyaffair when a British businessman was convicted of exporting second-hand IBMmachines into the Eastern Bloc and, by so doing, of contravening the CoComlist.andP;  -andM;By Mark JohnandM;The Briton maintained his innocence, saying that he was unaware that the IBMswere being on-shipped to the East from the warehouse to which he had sentthem in Stockholm, but was eventually convicted when, among other things,receipts were found showing that he had had dinner with representatives ofIsotimpex; Bulgaria, it had been established, was the main recipient of thesemachines.andP;  This anecdote is only to demonstrate the desire on both sides todispense with the CoCom list: Isotimpex is by no means the only EasternEuropean firm to capitalise on opportunities such as these, and the cripplingeffect that the CoCom list has had on Eastern European &quot;high-tech&quot; firms goessome way to mitigating the Sofia-based company's part in the transgression -the temptation to receive and examine Western-produced computers must be justas strong as was the temptation felt by nineteenth century physicians whenBurke and Hare offered them a fresh corpse.andP;  Recent noises from the USgovernment indicate that the flow of goods to the East may very soon be lessrestricted, but, in the meantime, the CoCom leg acy was clearly evident inthe ambivalence with which firms like Isotimpex view the opening up of theIron Curtain.andP;  CoCom restrictions have affected Isotimpex in an architypalway, and with 70,000 staff spread across all its activities - about 5,000more than Robotron at the last count - Isotimpex may have much to gain, butalso much to lose from these developments.andP;  Like most of the large Easterninformation technology suppliers, it manufactures a bit of everything -100,000 personal computers a year, various peripherals and a range oftelecommunications equipment - and, not being able to compete effectively inthe West, these go typically to Bulgarian firms and into the Comecon market.andO;Isotimpex is now in the position of having to formulate marketing strategiesindependent of a national plan, and early indications are that this may bebeyond the scope of a management with no experience of free market trading:Isotimpex claims that it has around 60 &quot;agents&quot; in the West, and there arevague notions of turning these into proper distribution outlets.andM;Joint ManufactureandM;There is also talk of sorting out some means of dealing with Western firms inBulgaria - most likely by barter until the present currency restrictions areremoved.andP;  Isotimpex stated that it had received interest from several Westernfirms, but, with none of the joint venture announcements that the likes ofRobotron and Videoton were able to make, the impression was that Isotimpex isnot being courted with the same respect that its counterparts in East Germanyand Hungary are - that, in effect, all the West wants from Isotimpex is itsaccess to the local market.andP;  It says that it definitely expects to reduce itsworkforce in the effort to compete with new entrants into the Bulgarianmarket; but unless it can come to some arrangements with Western firms fromwhich it can benefit itself - for example, technology exchanges and jointmanufacturing deals - Isotimpex, like its counterparts in the rest of theEast, may be forced to reduce its workforce more dramatically than themanagement currently estimates.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
