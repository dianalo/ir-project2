IBM offers equipment and software that can be added onto itsmost powerful mainframe computers so they function assupercomputers. Although Cray Research Inc. is considered theworld's leading supercomputer manufacturer, IBM has actually soldmore units when its souped-up mainframes are counted.   IBM developed the new offerings in cooperation with partnersincluding Cornell University and Los Alamos National Laboratory,said the IBM executive, Thomas Jarosh, director of scientific andtechnical computing marketing in the United States.   Jarosh declined Tuesday to specify the peak speed of the systemsso no direct comparison is possible with machines made by Cray andother supercomputer makers.   Prices will be announced in 60 days and installations will beginno later than the last quarter of 1989.   IBM's most powerful mainframe computer is the ES-3090 Model 600,which has six processors. New hardware and software will allowcustomers to hook two of those machines together so a job can berun across as many as 12 processors at once.   Also announced was a communications channel that can transferdata at 800 million bits a second. IBM said it was the firstchannel to meet a draft standard established by the AmericanNational Standards Institute.   In addition, IBM said new software would speed up the computer'sability to find and place data in storage devices.</TEXT></DOC>
