The insurance concern had a year-earlier fourth-quarter loss of $2.6 million.    For all of 1986, the company posted a loss of $236,000, compared with a loss of $2.5 million a year earlier.    A North East spokesman said the company took a $1.2 million charge in the fourth quarter as a result of the potential non-recovery of certain reinsurance claims. Because of its 1985 and 1986 losses, North East may be found in violation of minimum capital and surplus requirements and may be subject to sanctions by insurance regulators in Maine and New York, the company said.    North East added that in September the Maine Bureau of Insurance declared that the company was in violation of such minimums and ordered hearings to determine whether it has subsequently met minimum capital requirements.    The company said it believes that as of Dec. 31 it met required capital and surplus -- or assets minus liabilities -- minimums in Maine. However, it added that Maine regulators are still conducting hearings on the matter. </TEXT></DOC>
