The gas transmissionsystems are classified into low-pressure (500 - 600 milli H{sub 2}O),middle-pressure(1 - 10 kg/cm{sup 2}G), and high -pressure (10 kg/cm andhigher) gas transmission systems, based on the pressure of gas flowingthrough the pipelines. The low-pressure transmission system is used forsmall-scale gas consumers the middle pressure system for gas transmissionin a city, and the high pressure system for large gas demand regionssuch as the Tokyo region. For storage of gas, water sealed gas holdersand dry seal gas holders for storage at middle-pressure are generallyused. A day gas manufacture and storage plan is made, based on the estimationof gas demand. In fact, it is difficult to estimate correctly a gas demandper hour. The manufacture and the storage of gas is conducted, basedon the practical consumption of gas calculated every one or two hoursand the gas estimation modified. (5 figs, 3 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
