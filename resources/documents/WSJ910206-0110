December's $235.62 billion in orders followed a revised5.8% drop in November, originally reported as a 5.9% decline.The November decrease was the biggest monthly plunge sinceorders fell 7% in December 1974.</LP><TEXT>   Total orders at factories in 1990 were $2.86 trillion,1.4% higher than in 1989. Last year's increase was thesmallest rise since orders dropped 1.2% in 1986.   Orders in December were below the expectations of manyeconomists and added further evidence of the stagnation ofthe economy in the fourth quarter.   Orders for durable goods -- goods expected to last morethan three years -- were up a revised 3.4% in December. Inlast week's preliminary report on durable-goods orders, theincrease was estimated at 4.4%. The increase was concentratedin defense capital goods, which rose 59.8% to $8.4 billionafter a 26.9% drop in November. Orders for commercialaircraft and parts also were up markedly.   If defense orders aren't counted, total orders were down1.4% in December.   Orders for nondurable goods, meanwhile, fell 3.4%,&quot;reflecting erratic movements in the petroleum, chemicals andtobacco industries,&quot; the Commerce Department said. Suchorders declined 1% in November.   Manufacturers' inventories decreased 0.8% in Decemberafter increasing 0.2% in November. Inventories declined 1.3%in durable goods industries, while inventories of makers ofnondurable goods were up 0.1%.
