The rating concern cited the process equipment maker's plans to sell off most of its businesses and drastically reduce debt with proceeds from those asset sales and an exchange of debt for common stock. Sandamp;P said the success of the plan depends on acceptance by Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., which is being asked to forgo some obligations owed to it in return for an equity position, and the company's unions, which must accept substantially lower health benefits. &quot;Should the overall plan succeed, Allis-Chalmers would be left with a healthy business and a much stronger balance sheet. But, should the plan fail, the concern may be forced to file for bankruptcy,&quot; the rating concern said. Allis-Chalmers said it hadn't any comment on the move.    ---   BAY STATE GAS CO.'s $8 million of preferred stock outstanding received a ratings increase to single-A from single-A-minus from Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. The Canton, Mass., utility has been redeeming the preferred, reducing it by about $5 million in the past few months, Sandamp;P said. As a result, the preferred has a lessened role in the company's capital structure, the rating agency said.    ---   BEVERLY ENTERPRISES -- Sandamp;P lowered ratings on senior unsecured debt of this Pasadena, Calif.-based nursing-home operator to double-B-minus from double-B and on its subordinated debt to single-B-plus from double-B-minus. About $225 million of debt is affected. The rating concern cited the company's plan to buy as many as 10 million of its own common shares, which Sandamp;P said would increase financial risk &quot;while earnings prospects become more clouded.&quot; Sandamp;P said that even though Beverly is using proceeds from asset sales for part of the share buyback, &quot;the decapitalization would raise adjusted debt leverage above the 75% level of recent years.&quot; Sandamp;P also said the company depends on reimbursement from &quot;constrained&quot; state Medicaid budgets for about two-thirds of its revenue. A Beverly spokesman said the company had expected the downgrading. </TEXT></DOC>
