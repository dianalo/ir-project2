The two offices of the failed thrift, Yankee Bank for Finance andamp; Savings, which had assets of $521.7 million, are to reopen today as branches of Boston Five Cents Savings Bank.    Yankee Bank held deposits of $474.8 million in 32,000 accounts, including 423 accounts with a total of $20.7 million in excess of the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor. Uninsured depositors will share proportionately with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in proceeds from the sale of the failed thrift's assets.    Yankee Bank, a savings bank chartered by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and insured by the FDIC, was a subsidiary of Yankee Cos., a Cohasset, Mass.-based energy company. The parent recently announced a restructuring plan after reporting a $50.3 million loss for the year ending June 30.    Yankee Bank was the 148th FDIC-insured institution to fail nationwide this year, the second in Massachusetts.    Separately, the FDIC agreed to contribute $4.5 million to Commercial Bank, Oklahoma City, to prevent it from failing. The bank has assets of $23.8 million. William and Lynda Cameron, Oklahoma City investors, are to add $2 million to the bank's capital.    As part of the arrangement, the Camerons, who are brother and sister, acquired 100% of Commercial Bankstock Inc., the holding company that owns Commercial. The Camerons previously held 75%, according to bank officials.    FDIC officials said the agency acted after the comptroller of the currency said Commercial was in danger of failing. The FDIC said it won't provide any other assistance to the bank and won't assume any of its loans. </TEXT></DOC>
