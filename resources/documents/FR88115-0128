Under 28 U.S.C. 994(x), promulgation of guidelines by the Commissionpursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994 is subject to the Administrative Procedure Actrulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553. However, Section 21(a) of the SentencingAct of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-182, Dec. 7, 1987) authorizes the Commission toadopt temporary guidelines or amendments under certain limited circumstances.The Commission understands the advance notice, comment and hearing provisionsthat apply to the promulgation of permanent guidelines to be inapplicableunder such circumstances. Absent contrary action, temporary guidelinesor amendments remain in effect until and during the pendency of the nextreport to Congress pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(p). The Commission concluded that questions as to the controlling status ofthe October 1987 revisions vis-a-vis the earlier published version hadcreated unnecessary confusion and uncertainty in interpreting the guidelines;the elimination of this confusion and uncertainty constituted an urgentand compelling reason to re-adopt the October 1987 version under the emergencyguidelines promulgation authority. In addition, the Commission has learnedthat users of the guidelines found certain aspects of the guidelines orcommentary to be unclear, causing inconsistent interpretations. Furthermore,in a number of instances, clerical or technical errors had been made inthe guidelines and commentary; these errors were likely to lead to errorsin applying the guidelines, and in one instance rendered the guidelineinconsistent with existing law. The Commission determined that the preventionof application errors and the avoidance of unnecessary litigation constitutedurgent and compelling reasons to make various amendments. Finally, theCommission concluded that certain guidelines should be revised promptlyto conform to recently-enacted legislation pertaining to criminal offenses,as contemplated by Section 21(a)(2) of the Sentencing Act of 1987. Thespecific reason(s) for each amendment are listed immediately after thatamendment in the material that follows.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Section 21(a) of the Sentencing Act of 1987 (Pub.

L. 100-182, Dec. 7, 1987),the Sentencing Commission has: (1) Re-promulgated, effective January 15, 1988, the revisions in officialcommentary, policy statement revision, and correction of typographicalerrors in certain guidelines which were previously adopted by the Commissionand issued in the Guidelines Manual (October 1987); and (2) Promulgated, also effective January 15, 1988, additional temporaryamendments to previously issued sentencing guidelines and official commentaryas set forth in this Appendix. The format under which the temporary amendments are presented in this Appendixis designed to facilitate a comparison between previously existing andamended provisions, in the event it becomes necessary to reference theformer guideline or commentary language. <ITAG tagnum="84">andSection; <T4>1B1.1.

Section 1B1.1(d) is amended by deleting ``one'' and ``three'' and insertingin lieu thereof ``(a)'' and ``(c)'' respectively. The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.1 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amendedby inserting, as an additional note, the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">``4.

Relevant Conduct (Retitled Relevant Conduct (Factors that Determinethe Guideline Range)) </T4>3. Section 1B1.3 and the Commentary thereto is amended by deleting theentire text thereof, including the title, as follows:``Relevant Conduct To determine the seriousness of the offense conduct, all conduct, circumstances,and injuries relevant to the offense of conviction shall be taken intoaccount. (a) Unless otherwise specified under the guidelines, conduct and circumstancesrelevant to the offense of conviction means: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">acts or omissions committed or aided and abetted by the defendant,or by a person for whose conduct the defendant is legally accountable,that (1) are part of the same course of conduct, or a common scheme orplan, as the offense of conviction, or (2) are relevant to the defendant'sstate of mind or motive in committing the offense of conviction, or (3)indicate the defendant's degree of dependence upon criminal activity fora livelihood. (b) Injury relevant to the offense of conviction means harm which is causedintentionally, recklessly or by criminal negligence in the course of conductrelevant to the offense of conviction. <ITAG tagnum="74">Commentary </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Application Note: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. In sentencing, the court should consider all relevant offense andoffender characteristics. For purposes of assessing offense conduct, therelevant conduct and circumstances of the offense of conviction are asfollows: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Conduct directed toward preparation for or commission of the offenseof conviction, and efforts to avoid detection and responsibility for theoffense of conviction; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Conduct indicating that the offense of conviction was to some degreepart of a broader purpose, scheme, or plan; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Conduct that is relevant to the state of mind or motive of thedefendant in committing the crime; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Conduct that is relevant to the defendant's involvement in crimeas a livelihood.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">The first three criteria are derived from two sources, Rule 8(a) ofthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, governing joinder of similar orrelated offenses, and Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, permittingadmission of evidence of other crimes to establish motive, intent, plan,and common scheme. These rules provide standards that govern considerationat trial of crimes ``of the same or similar character,'' and utilize conceptsand terminology familiar to judges, prosecutors, and defenders. The governingstandard should be liberally construed in favor of considering informationgenerally appropriate to sentencing. When other crimes are inadmissibleunder the Rule 404(b) standard, such crimes may not be ``relevant to theoffense of conviction'' under the criteria that determine this questionfor purposes of Chapter Two; such crimes would, however, be consideredin determining the relevant offender characteristics to the extent authorizedby Chapter Three (Adjustments), and Chapter Four (Criminal History andCriminal Livelihood) and Chapter Five, Part H (Specific Offender Characteristics).This construction is consistent with the existing rule that ``[n]o limitationshall be placed on the information concerning the background, character,and conduct of a person convicted of an offense * * * for the purpose ofimposing an appropriate sentence,'' 18 U.S.C. 3577, so long as the information``has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.''United States v. Marshall, 519 F. Supp. 751 (D. Wis. 1981), aff'd, 719F.2d 887 (7th Cir. 1983). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The last of these criteria is intended to ensure that a judge mayconsider at sentencing, information that, although not specifically withinother criteria of relevance, indicates that the defendant engages in crimefor a living. Inclusion of this information in sentencing considerationsis consistent with 28 U.S.C. 994(d)(11).'',</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and inserting in lieu thereof the following:``Relevant Conduct (Factors that Determine the Guideline Range) The conduct that is relevant to determining the applicable guideline rangeincludes that set forth below. (a) Chapters Two (Offense Conduct) and Three (Adjustments). Unless otherwisespecified, (i) the base offense level where the guideline specifies morethan one base offense level, (ii) specific offense characteristics and(iii) cross references in Chapter Two, and (iv) adjustments in ChapterThree, shall be determined on the basis of the following: (1) All acts and omissions committed or aided and abetted by the defendant,or for which the defendant would be otherwise accountable, that occurredduring the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation forthat offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibilityfor that offense, or that otherwise were in furtherance of that offense;(2) Solely with respect to offenses of a character for which andSection;3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple counts, all such acts and omissionsthat were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan asthe offense of conviction; (3) All harm or risk of harm that resulted from the acts or omissions specifiedin subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) above, if the harm or risk was causedintentionally, recklessly or by criminal negligence, and all harm or riskthat was the object of such acts or omissions; (4) The defendant's state of mind, intent, motive and purpose in committingthe offense; and (5) Any other information specified in the applicable guideline. (b) Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood). To determinethe criminal history category and the applicability of the career offenderand criminal livelihood guidelines, the court shall consider all conductrelevant to a determination of the factors enumerated in the respectiveguidelines in Chapter Four. <ITAG tagnum="74">Commentary </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Application Notes: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Conduct ``for which the defendant is otherwise accountable,'' asused in subsection (a)(1), includes conduct that the defendant counseled,commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused. (Cf. 18 U.S.C. 2.) Ifthe conviction is for conspiracy, it includes conduct in furtherance ofthe conspiracy that was known to or was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant.If the conviction is for solicitation, misprision or accessory after thefact, it includes all conduct relevant to determining the offense levelfor the underlying offense that was known to or reasonably should havebeen known by the defendant. See generally andSection;andSection; 2X1.1-2X4.1.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. ``Such acts and omissions,'' as used in subsection (a)(2), refersto acts and omissions committed or aided and abetted by the defendant,or for which the defendant would be otherwise accountable. This subsectionapplies to offenses of types for which convictions on multiple counts wouldbe grouped together pursuant to andSection; 3D1.2(d); multiple convictionsare not required. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. ``Harm'' includes bodily injury, monetary loss, property damageand any resulting harm.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. If the offense guideline includes creating a risk or danger ofharm as a specific offense characteristic, whether that risk or dangerwas created is to be considered in determining the offense level. See,e.g., andSection; 2K1.4 (Arson); andSection; 2Q1.2 (Mishandling of Hazardousor Toxic Substances or Pesticides). If, however, the guideline refers onlyto harm sustained (e.g., andSection; 2A2.2 (Assault); andSection; 2B3.1 (Robbery))or to actual, attempted or intended harm (e.g., andSection; 2F1.1 (Fraud);andSection; 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation or Conspiracy)), the risk createdenters into the determination of the offense level only insofar as it isincorporated into the base offense level. Unless clearly indicated by theguidelines, harm that is merely risked is not to be treated as the equivalentof harm that occurred. When not adequately taken into account by the applicableoffense guideline, creation of a risk may provide a ground for imposinga sentence above the applicable guideline range. See generally andSection;1B1.4 (Information to be Used in Imposing Sentence); andSection; 5K2.0 (Groundsfor Departure). The extent to which harm that was attempted or intendedenters into the determination of the offense level should be determinedin accordance with andSection; 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation or Conspiracy)and the applicable offense guideline. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. A particular guideline (in the base offense level or in a specificoffense characteristic) may expressly direct that a particular factor beapplied only if the defendant was convicted of a particular statute. E.g.,in andSection; 2K2.3, a base offense level of 12 is used ``if convicted under26 U.S.C. 5861.'' Unless such an express direction is included, convictionunder the statute is not required. Thus, use of a statutory reference todescribe a particular set of circumstances does not require a convictionunder the referenced statute. Examples of this usage are found in andSection;2K1.3(b)(4) (``if the defendant was a person prohibited from receivingexplosives under 18 U.S.C. 842(i), or if the defendant knowingly distributedexplosives to a person prohibited from receiving explosives under 18 U.S.C.842(i), increase by 10 levels''); and andSection; 2A3.4(b)(2) (``if the abusivecontact was accomplished as defined in 18 U.S.C.  2242, increase by 4 levels'').</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Background: </T3>This section prescribes rules for determining theapplicable guideline sentencing range, whereas andSection; 1B1.4 (Informationto be Used in Imposing Sentence) governs the range of information thatthe court may consider in adjudging sentence once the guideline sentencingrange has been determined. Conduct that is not formally charged or is notan element of the offense of conviction may enter into the determinationof the applicable guideline sentencing range. The range of informationthat may be considered at sentencing is broader than the range of informationupon which the applicable sentencing range is determined. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Subsection (a) establishes a rule of construction by specifying, inthe absence of more explicit instructions in the context of a specificguideline, the range of conduct that is relevant to determining the applicableoffense level (except for the determination of the applicable offense guideline,which is governed by andSection; 1B1.2(a)). No such rule of constructionis necessary with respect to Chapter Four because the guidelines in thatChapter are explicit as to the specific factors to be considered. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Subsection (a)(2) provides for consideration of a broader range ofconduct with respect to one class of offenses, primarily certain property,tax, fraud and drug offenses for which the guidelines depend substantiallyon quantity, than with respect to other offenses such as assault, robberyand burglary. The distinction is made on the basis of andSection; 3D1.2(d),which provides for grouping together (i.e., treating as a single count)all counts charging offenses of a type covered by this subsection. However,the applicability of subsection (a)(2) does not depend upon whether multiplecounts are alleged. Thus, in an embezzlement case, for example, embezzledfunds that may not be specified in any count of conviction are nonethelessincluded in determining the offense level if they are part of the samecourse of conduct or part of the same scheme or plan as the count of conviction.Similarly, in a drug distribution case, quantities and types of drugs notspecified in the count of conviction are to be included in determiningthe offense level if they were part of the same course of conduct or partof a common scheme or plan as the count of conviction. On the other hand,in a robbery case in which the defendant robbed two banks, the amount ofmoney taken in one robbery would not be taken into account in determiningthe guideline range for the other robbery, even if both robberies werepart of a single course of conduct or the same scheme or plan. (This istrue whether the defendant is convicted of one or both robberies.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) adopt different rules because offensesof the character dealt with in subsection (a)(2) (i.e., to which andSection;3D1.2(d) applies) often involve a pattern of misconduct that cannot readilybe broken into discrete, identifiable units that are meaningful for purposesof sentencing. For example, a pattern of embezzlement may consist of severalacts of taking that cannot separately be identified, even though the overallconduct is clear. In addition, the distinctions that the law makes as towhat constitutes separate counts or offenses often turn on technical elementsthat are not especially meaningful for purposes of sentencing. Thus, ina mail fraud case, the scheme is an element of the offense and each mailingmay be the basis for a separate count; in an embezzlement case, each takingmay provide a basis for a separate count. Another consideration is thatin a pattern of small thefts, for example, it is important to take intoaccount the full range of related conduct. Relying on the entire rangeof conduct, regardless of the number of counts that are alleged or on whicha conviction is obtained, appears to be the most reasonable approach towriting workable guidelines for these offenses. Conversely, when andSection;3D1.2(d) does not apply, so that convictions on multiple counts are consideredseparately in determining the guideline sentencing range, the guidelinesprohibit aggregation of quantities from other counts in order to prevent``double counting'' of the conduct and harm from each count of conviction.Continuing offenses present similar practical problems. The reference toandSection; 3D1.2(d), which provides for grouping of multiple counts arisingout of a continuing offense when the offense guideline takes the continuingnature into account, also prevents double counting. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Subsection (a)(4) requires consideration of the defendant's ``stateof mind, intent, motive or purpose in committing the offense.'' The defendant'sstate of mind is an element of the offense that may constitute a specificoffense characteristic. See, e.g., andSection; 2A1.4 (Involuntary Manslaughter)(distinction made between recklessness and criminal negligence). The guidelinesalso incorporate broader notions of intent or purpose that are not elementsof the offense, e.g., whether the offense was committed for profit, orfor the purpose of facilitating a more serious offense. Accordingly, suchfactors must be considered in determining the applicable guideline range.''.</ITAG>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline. The amendedlanguage restates the intent of andSection; 1B1.3 as originally promulgated.<ITAG tagnum="85"/>andSection; <T4>1B1.4. Determining the Offense Level (Retitled Information to be Usedin Imposing Sentence (Selecting a Point Within the Guideline Range or Departingfrom the Guidelines)) </T4>4. Section 1B1.4 and the Commentary thereto is amended by deleting theentire text thereof, including the title, as follows:``Determining the Offense Level In determining the offense level: (a) Determine the base offense level from Chapter Two;(b) Make any applicable adjustments for specific offense characteristicsfrom Chapter Two in the order listed; (c) Make any applicable adjustments from Chapter Three; (d) Make any applicable adjustments from Chapter Four, Part B (Career Offendersand Criminal Livelihood). <ITAG tagnum="74">Commentary </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Application Notes: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. A particular guideline (in the base offense level or in a specificoffense characteristic) may expressly direct that a particular factor beapplied only if the defendant was convicted of a particular statute. E.g.,in andSection; 2K2.3, a base offense level of 12 is used ``if convicted under26 U.S.C. 5861.'' Unless such an express direction is included, convictionunder the statute is not required. Thus, use of a statutory reference todescribe a particular set of circumstances does not require a convictionunder the referenced statute. Examples of this usage are found in andSection;2K1.3(b)(4) (``if the defendant was a person prohibited from receivingexplosives under 18 U.S.C. 842(i), or if the defendant knowingly distributedexplosives to a person prohibited from receiving explosives under 18 U.S.C. 842(i), increase by 10 levels''); and andSection; 2A3.4(b)(2) (``if theabusive contact was accomplished as defined in 18 U.S.C.  2242, increaseby 4 levels''). In such cases, the particular circumstances described areto be evaluated under the ``relevant conduct'' standard of andSection; 1B1.3.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Once the appropriate base offense level is determined, all specificoffense characteristics are to be applied in the order listed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The offense level adjustments from more than one specific offensecharacteristic within an offense guideline are cumulative (added together)unless the guideline specifies that only the greater (or greatest) is tobe used. Within each specific offense characteristic subsection, however,the offense level adjustments are alternative; only the one that best describesthe conduct is to be used. E.g., in andSection; 2A2.2(b)(3), pertaining todegree of bodily injury, the subsection that best describes the level ofbodily injury is used; the adjustments from different degrees of bodilyinjury (subsections (A), (B) and (C)) are not added together). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. The adjustments in Chapter Three that may apply include Part A(Victim-Related Adjustments), Part B (Role in the Offense), Part C (Obstruction),Part D (Multiple Counts), and Part E (Acceptance of Responsibility).'',</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and inserting in lieu thereof the following:``Information to be Used in Imposing Sentence (Selecting a Point Withinthe Guideline Range or Departing from the Guidelines) In determining the sentence to impose within the guideline range, or whethera departure from the guidelines is warranted, the court may consider, withoutlimitation, any information concerning the background, character and conductof the defendant, unless otherwise prohibited by law. See 18 U.S.C.  3661.<ITAG tagnum="74">Commentary </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Background: </T3>This section distinguishes between factors that determinethe applicable guideline sentencing range (andSection; 1B1.3) and informationthat a court may consider in imposing sentence within that range. The sectionis based on 18 U.S.C. 3661, which recodifies 18 U.S.C. 3557. The recodificationof this 1970 statute in 1984 with an effective date of 1987 (99 Stat. 1728),makes it clear that Congress intended that no limitation would be placedon the information that a court may consider in imposing an appropriatesentence under the future guideline sentencing system. A court is not precludedfrom considering information that the guidelines do not take into account.For example, if the defendant committed two robberies, but as part of aplea negotiation entered a guilty plea to only one, the robbery that wasnot taken into account by the guidelines would provide a reason for sentencingat the top of the guideline range. In addition, information that does notenter into the determination of the applicable guideline sentencing rangemay be considered in determining whether and to what extent to depart fromthe guidelines. Some policy statements do, however, express a Commissionpolicy that certain factors should not be considered for any purpose, orshould be considered only for limited purposes. See, e.g., Chapter Five,Part H (Specific Offender Characteristics).''. </ITAG>The purposes of this amendment are to remove material made redundant bythe reorganization of this Part and to replace it with material that clarifiesthe operation of the guidelines. The material formerly in this sectionis now covered by andSection; 1B1.1 <ITAG tagnum="84">andSection; 2B1.2. Receiving Stolen Property </ITAG>5.
