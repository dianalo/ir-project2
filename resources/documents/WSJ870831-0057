Mrs. Mata is just one of the many Hispanics Pope John Paul hopes to reach on his 10-day U.S. tour. Although he wants to tour the South and visit cities he hasn't seen before, the pope knows the importance of Hispanic Americans in the Catholic Church's future. During his first U.S. tour eight years ago, he stopped in such European-immigrant capitals as Boston and New York; this time, the pope has chosen destinations with large Hispanic populations for all but two of his nine stops.    The growth in Spanish-speaking followers is striking. Already, two out of five U.S. Catholics are Hispanic. By the end of the century, more than half will be. &quot;There is recognition by the hierarchy in Rome and the U.S.,&quot; says San Antonio Mayor Cisneros, &quot;of the immense building-block potential -- almost a new lease on life -- that the Catholic Church will get in Hispanic America.&quot;    The church needs to widen its base of support. The pope's conservative policies have aroused the most debate among Catholics since the reforms of Vatican II under Pope John XXIII more than 20 years ago. In survey after survey, a majority of Catholics have criticized the Vatican's bans on artificial birth control, the ordination of women and remarriage by the divorced. The church's stands on abortion, homosexuality and other issues have angered non-Catholics as well.    The resistance to Vatican orthodoxy even extends to this citadel of Catholicism -- though with a difference. Elsewhere on his tour, the pope is likely to encounter angry demonstrations against his reassertion of rigid doctrine. Here, any protests will be small and quiet. &quot;There are many who are against him,&quot; says Mexico-born Lourdes Pena, &quot;but many who are in favor of him, the Mexicanos more than the Americanos.&quot;    San Antonio -- the most Mexican city in the nation and among the most Catholic -- is likely to give the pope the greatest outpouring of affection of his U.S. tour. In the biggest mass gathering in Texas history, nearly a million jubilant Catholics are expected to line the parade routes and pack a hot, vacant field to hear him celebrate Mass.    The relative tranquillity here on the eve of the papal visit reflects the sensitivity and shrewdness of the area's largely Hispanic Catholic leadership. Despite the pope's harsh teachings against the &quot;intrinsic disorder&quot; of homosexuality, for instance, the archdiocese here is believed to be one of only three that officially recognize homosexuals through a special ministry. Thus, instead of planning flamboyant protests as homosexuals in San Francisco are doing, gay Catholics here have adopted the motto &quot;Our protest is prayer.&quot;    Elsewhere, some Jewish leaders plan to picket the pope for his June meeting with Austrian President Kurt Waldheim, who has been accused of complicity in Nazi war crimes. But Jews here have made a separate peace with local church leaders, who are planning a Holocaust studies program for parochial-school students in the seventh and eighth grades.    The archdiocese here is also distinguished by its laity. To most Latinos, the church is like the family -- something to disagree with, perhaps, but never to abandon. &quot;They don't feel that they have to bang on doors of the church for change. They'll say that 'I had to do it,' and then go back to church,&quot; says Joseph Bernal, a 60-year-old elementary-school principal.    The church here certainly isn't free of dissent -- far from it. One pastor claims that the local hierarchy has moved to suppress open confrontation, reminding homosexual leaders, for instance, that they hold special Masses in an ornate downtown church only at the discretion of the archdiocese. (Even so, one lesbian Catholic intends to distribute condoms along the parade route.) Similarly, liberal theologians have been asked to keep mum, says the Rev. Emil Wesselsky.    And some Catholics here, like Catholics elsewhere, are questioning whether the $2.5 million being spent on security and festivities in San Antonio wouldn't be better spent helping the poor. &quot;Would Jesus come in this manner?&quot; asks Laura Sanchez, who runs a &quot;sanctuary&quot; for illegal immigrants in her home. &quot;I don't think so.&quot;    But in the heart of the west side barrios, where some women still wear lace mantillas to worship at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church and others cross themselves as they go by, poor women in housedresses are conducting a novena, or nine days of praying, for the success of the papal visit. They whip their fans furiously against the heat as their voices rise in a song about Mexico's patron saint, &quot;la Virgen de Guadalupe,&quot; that praises those who endure their miseries without complaint.    The city's mayor approaches the papal visit with a mixture of excitement and sadness. His infant son -- christened John Paul in honor, Mr. Cisneros says, of the &quot;single most outstanding person in the world&quot; -- was born with life-threatening heart defects. But as his wife and two daughters prepare to leave their home in the barrio for evening Mass, he expresses his enthusiasm for the pope's visit. &quot;It is epic in scale in every respect,&quot; he says, &quot;from spiritual enthusiasm to the scale of logistics.&quot;    So far, in fact, the biggest controversy related to the visit here has involved logistics, or how to accommodate the expected throng of worshipers. The city's health director, Katharine Rathbun, resigned from her post ahead of schedule, charging that the archdiocese was ignoring her repeated warnings about safety problems. She compares putting 500,000 people on a 144-acre site without adequate shade or water supplies with staging a rock concert. But &quot;at a rock concert,&quot; she notes, &quot;you don't have many 65-year-old women.&quot; Archdiocese officials respond that worshipers tend to be more orderly than rock fans.    Another crowd-control concern is related to an important church issue here: illegal immigration. As many as 200,000 Mexicans, including 18 bishops and a cardinal, are expected to cross the U.S. border to see &quot;el Papa.&quot; But immigration authorities, who say they are loath to permit a field day for illegal immigrants, have authorized overtime to try to seal the border against unlawful crossings.    Shared opposition to restrictive immigration policies has helped to unify the Catholic leadership and laity here. An illegal Costa Rican immigrant, who recently lost his leg because of a work accident, even lives in a local rectory. &quot;We want lawmen to be more sensitive to their needs,&quot; says Archbishop Patrick Flores.    But what some Hispanic Catholics want most is a declaration from the pope opposing the nation's new immigration law. The law enables some illegal immigrants to receive amnesty, but it has outlawed any source of livelihood in the U.S. for the millions who can't qualify. In his 1981 encyclical &quot;On Human Work,&quot; Pope John Paul II declared that &quot;man has the right to leave his native land for various motives -- and also the right to return -- in order to seek better conditions in another country.&quot; Says Jose Reyes, an illegal Guatemalan immigrant: &quot;I wish the pope would urge that they abolish this law and that we could stay.&quot;    The church here hasn't always been so sensitive to its Latinos. A dozen years ago, when Hispanics pleaded for Spanish-language Masses at St. Anne's Church, the church agreed to celebrate them, but only on the patio. When Spanish was finally allowed inside the sanctuary, it was for the last and least convenient service of the day.    &quot;It is only in recent years that the church has begun -- and I underscore begun -- to accept the Hispanic Catholic as a positive force,&quot; says the Rev. Virgilio Elizondo, the 52-year-old pastor at San Fernando Cathedral. He recalls a story told by then-Bishop Flores about a young woman who tried to commit suicide after her mother ignored her stories about repeated sexual abuse by the mother's boyfriends. &quot;That mother,&quot; Bishop Flores said, &quot;has been what the church has been to Hispanics.&quot;    Now that Bishop Flores, the first Mexican-American bishop in the U.S., has become archbishop and the archdiocese has embraced economic development and &quot;social justice&quot; projects for Hispanics, the church is once again becoming a major influence in the lives of its members. As that happens, the clergy must increasingly mediate between its parishioners' modern morals and the stern precepts of John Paul II.    At the church's Seton Home for unwed mothers, the residents' religious faith is every bit as evident as their departure from Vatican doctrine. Brenda De Leon, 18 years old and five months pregnant, attends Mass weekly. Margaret Strum, a 21-year-old who is expecting twins in November, still considers herself a good Catholic. &quot;As long as I confess my sins,&quot; she says, &quot;I'll be forgiven.&quot;    &quot;I don't consider them bad people or bad Catholics,&quot; says Sister Mary Katherine Heenan of the 125 young women who have passed through the home since 1985. &quot;These girls are living witnesses of why the church doesn't condone premarital sex -- because of the aftermath . . . embarrassment and suffering.&quot;    Condemnation of &quot;la pildora&quot; (the pill) and other forms of birth control remains strong among many older churchgoers. But among young Catholics, birth control is viewed benignly. &quot;I feel very strongly birth control should be used,&quot; says Eddie Guajardo, 22. &quot;A girl shouldn't have a baby until she's committed to someone.&quot;    Another issue that concerns Catholics here is profiteering tied to the pope's visit. The most conspicuous example may be the $11.95 T-shirt that is a takeoff on Budweiser beer's canine mascot, Spuds McKenzie. The T-shirt reads &quot;Pope McKenzie: The original Vatican animal&quot; and shows the dog in a papal pose with his right paw raised. &quot;For me, this is an insult,&quot; Father Elizondo said at a recent cathedral Mass.    Papalphernalia Inc., which is based here, has sold more than 25,000 masks depicting the pope under a huge miter. &quot;I think it would be an enormous tribute to see a sea of people wearing pope masks,&quot; says Karen Reid, who owns the company. &quot;That's my dream.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
