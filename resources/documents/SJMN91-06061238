Both are in San Jose but arein opposite corners of the district.;    The announcement was greeted byshouts and tears. Branham students in blue varsity jackets and Blackfordstudents in red and gold jackets held each other and wept among folding chairsknocked over in the excitement.;    Students from Prospect High School inSaratoga, however, which had been rumored as one of the schools to close,greeted the news with screams of excitement.;    Steffanie Nelson, a Blackfordsophomore, said, &quot;We weren't expecting it, no. It's upsetting, but weunderstand that it has to close. We're sorry it has to be our school.&quot;;    Theboard's vote concurred with an unexpected recommendation by districtSuperintendent Bruce Hauger, who had previously said he would make norecommendation on the matter.;    Hauger said after the vote that he offeredthe recommendations at the board's request.;    Trustees George St. Clair,Alice Farnham and Sarah Dunham voted to keep Leigh and Del Mar high schools inSan Jose, Prospect High in Saratoga and Westmont High School in Campbell asthe district's remaining four high schools.;    Trustees Louis Marotti andRoderick MacDermott abstained.;    The board took a short break after the voteto receive the appreciation and the anger of the large group assembled at theLeigh High cafeteria.;    Shortly after the break, the board voted unanimouslyto send notices to 99 school employees saying they may be laid off at the endof the school year.;    The state requires that such notices be mailed byMarch 15. Only about 30 of those people are actually expected to be laid off.;   Trustees in the district voted 3-2 six weeks ago to close two of theschools but delayed selecting those sites until a public hearing could be heldon each campus. At the hearings, students, parents and teachers had theopportunity to tell the board what made their school special.;    Closing hasbeen a recurring issue in the district since Camden and Campbell high schoolswere shut down a decade ago. Although money is tight and enrollment hasdropped, opposition to closing schools has remained strong, and, as Thursday'svote approached, some in the community continued to argue that the districthad other options.;    The administration and teachers, however, have pressedfor the closing of schools as a way to cut expenses and boost educationalprograms.;    School officials warned months ago that the district faced alarge financial shortfall and that there were few services left to cut thatwould not affect the classroom. Campbell Union is expected to spend about $5million more than it takes in next year. Trustees need to cut at least $3.2million from the budget and closing the two schools will only provide part ofthe solution, making up about half that amount.;    The district's financialproblems have been fueled by years of poor state funding and decliningenrollment. The enrollment of 5,828 students is about half what it was 10years ago and campuses are operating at about 49 percent capacity.;    AtBranham High this morning, principal Jim Russell and the faculty met for anearly morning brunch before a series of assemblies scheduled for all classes.;   Trying to lighten the mood, someone brought in a recorder to play arendition of &quot;Taps&quot; featuring the sounds of screams in the background.;   Russell said he is urging staff and students to create &quot;a classy closing. Wehave 23 years of tradition, but people will remember these last three monthsand how we conducted ourselves.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ALETA PAYNE, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910301  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  701  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday March 1, 199100061238,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
