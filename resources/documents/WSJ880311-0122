In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group, which is represented on Scitex's board, said it increased its holdings in the Herzlia, Israel-based maker of computer graphics systems &quot;to protect the ability (of the group) . . . to continue to influence the policies of Scitex and to assure that any extraordinary corporate transaction involving Scitex would be made with fair consideration given&quot; to its interests.    As previously reported, James P. Lennane, chairman of System Integrators Inc., a Sacramento, Calif.-based maker of computer systems for publishing concerns, said he holds a 5.53% stake and may seek a greater role in Scitex. Mr. Lennane said he bought the stake for an investment, is considering increasing his holdings through open market purchases, privately or by tender offer, and also is considering seeking a seat on Scitex's board.    The Clal group said its stake consists of about 3.2 million Scitex common shares outstanding, including 85,000 bought from March 1 to last Tuesday for $3.625 to $4 each.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Scitex's stock closed at $4.3125 cents, up 15.25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
