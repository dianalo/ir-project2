<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-95-0985 </DOCNO><TEXT>Missoula, Montana, has a long history of air pollution due to a largeextent to residential wood combustion (RWC), road dust, and winter inversions.Numerous studies have been conducted in the past 10 years examining variousaspects of the problem. During the winter of 1986/1987, an extensiveambient and source sampling program was conducted to quantify the ambientlevels of particles attributable to specific sources by using chemicalmass balance (CMB) receptor modeling. The limiting factor in many CMBstudies has been the lack of representativeness in the source profilesused. This is particularly problematic with RWC and road dust sources.The chemical composition of road dust can change dramatically over relativelyshort distances and the chemical composition of RWC has been shown tobe very variable due to the differences in wood fuel, appliance type,and operational parameters. The source sampling strategy and chemicalprofiles for several Missoula particulate sources are presented here.Major emphasis was placed on obtaining representative RWC and road dust&quot;fingerprints.&quot; Automobile exhaust, diesel truck and train exhaust, andseveral small wood-products point sources were also sampled and analyzed.</TEXT></DOC>
