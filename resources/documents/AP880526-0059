The declaration, released Wednesday, said the OAU would achievesuch goals through a renewed commitment to ``unity, solidarity,liberation and development'' although it offered no new plans ofaction.   Earlier Wednesday, President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, theoutgoing OAU chairman, celebrated the organization's 25thanniversary with a chorus of ``Happy Birthday, OAU,'' as he cut acake.   African leaders planted trees and unveiled a marble plaque withgold engraving of the organization's anniversay theme: Unity,Solidarity, Liberation, Development.   Groups from Sudan, Zambia, Guinea and Algeria danced and sang.   Security was light for the more than 30 heads of government andstate gathered at the 50-member body's headquarters in the capitalof Addis Ababa. The celebration will be followed by a three-daysummit beginning today.   Many of the 40 points in the 11-page declaration repeated theoriginal objectives of the OAU's founding fathers, voiced in AddisAbaba 25 years ago.   The declaration highlighted a renewed commitment to bring aboutthe early independence of Namibia, also known as South-West Africa,and to eradicate South Africa's policy of race segregation, calledapartheid.   Namibia is under South Africa's control.   The declaration reaffirmed ``the primacy of the armed struggleand resolve to increase financial, material and military assistanceto the national liberation movemments.''   However, money might be a problem. Thirty-four of theorganization's members owe the OAU's liberation fund a total of $12million.   The declaration repeated a commitment to the imposition ofcomprehensive, mandatory sanctions against South Africa's white-ledgovernment and urged international support for such sanctions.   It did not say, however, how it would impose the sanctions onmany of its members who do about $1 billion of trade each year withthe apartheid state.   The declaration noted with grave concern continued acts ofaggression by South Africa against its neighbors and reaffirmed theOAU's commitment to provide financial and material help tostrengthen their defenses.   The declaration also expressed support for recent Angolan peacetalks involving top officials of Cuba, South Africa and Angola.</TEXT></DOC>
