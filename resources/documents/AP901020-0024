A Defense Department official confirmed Friday that the Pentagonhas told lawmakers Cheney is leaning toward recommending a veto ofthe 1991 military spending bill.   Cheney has not reached a final decision, however, and stillhopes changes will be made before the House and Senate take up thebill, possibly as early as Sunday, the official said.   Cheney was visiting France today on the final leg of a 10-daytrip that included Britain and the Soviet Union. Aides are keepinghim posted on details of the bill for the fiscal year that beganOct. 1.   Rep. Jon L. Kyl, R-Ariz., said he heard ``from people who oughtto know'' that Cheney will recommend a veo. Kyl is one of 15Republicans who were involved in negotiations on the bill butrefused to sign the final package.   The bill sets military spending at $288 billion for the fiscalyear that began Oct. 1 and represents a $19 billion reduction fromPresident Bush's request last January.   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said he spoke with Bush while thepresident was visiting Capitol Hill on Friday and urged him to signthe bill.   ``Afterward I had a chance to consult with senior staff and inthe brief exchange they reinforced my conviction that he will signthe legislation,'' the ranking Republican on the Senate ArmedServices Committee said.   The Pentagon has criticized several provisions, including cutsin troop levels and the budget request for the Strategic DefenseInitiative.   The bill provides $2.9 billion for SDI, nearly $2 billion lessthan Bush requested and $900 million below the level Congressprovided last year for the proposed anti-missile shield commonlyknown as Star Wars.   The measure also cuts 100,000 troops from the 2.1 million now inuniform worldwide. Cheney had urged Congress to hold the cuts to80,000.   Meanwhile, 22 House Republicans wrote Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, criticizing theexclusion of the panel's ranking Republican from the final days ofnegotiations.   Rep. Bill Dickinson, R-Ala., was not included in a late-nightsession attended Tuesday by Aspin, Warner and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in which the finaldefense package was produced.   In an interview, Aspin said Dickinson was excluded from asession that dealt with minor issues because he had indicated hewould oppose the bill. Aspin said he did not want Dickinson ``overhere throwing rocks.''   Elsewhere, the House by voice vote adopted the bill thatprovides $8.4 billion for military construction and family housingin the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The package is $764 millionless than what Bush sought.   In a step certain to rile the president, the bill bars spendingany federal funds from the NATO Infrastructure Fund for building abase in Crotone, Italy, for the Air Force's 401st Tactical Wing.   The bill slashes the administration's request for the NATOInfrastructure Fund from $420 million to $193 million.   Spain has said the wing of 72 F-16 jet fighters must be movedfrom Torrejon de Ardoz, and Italy agreed two years ago to provide anew home under NATO auspices.   Lawmakers have questioned the wisdom of constructing a base inEurope when Cheney plans to close others overseas and at home.</TEXT></DOC>
