The risk of insulin-dependent diabetes unexplainably varies17-fold across 14 nations studied, running generally higher incooler climates.   Scientists are studying such differences for clues to a far morebasic question: Just what causes insulin-dependent diabetes?   The disease occurs because the insulin-producing cells of thepancreas have been destroyed by a misguided attack by the body'simmune system. The 1 million Americans with it must injectthemselves with insulin every day to stay alive. Otherwise, sugarwill build up in their blood and cause such complications as heartand kidney disease, blindness and nerve damage.   Genes clearly play a key role in triggering the immune system'sattack. The vast majority of people who develop insulin-dependentdiabetes have particular genes linked to the disease.   However, most people with the susceptible genetic background donot develop diabetes, and the geographic variation in rates isevidence of an environmental role, said Ronald LaPorte, associateprofessor in the epidemiology department at the University ofPittsburgh.   Studies also suggest that rates for American children youngerthan 15 more than doubled from 1947 to 1976, which argues for achange in the environment, said James Warram of the Joslin DiabetesCenter in Boston.   What could this environmental factor be?   Viral infections are one theory, since viruses show seasonal andtemperature preferences as does insulin-dependent diabetes. Diet isanother proposed trigger, with some support from animal studies.   The question is complicated because the immune system startsattacking the pancreas years before a person shows diabetessymptoms. So any trigger must have acted at some unknown time inthe past, said Jerome I. Rotter of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center inLos Angeles.   Rotter also said much of the geographic difference in rates maybe due to differing prevalence of the susceptibility genes invarious populations, rather than just environmental causes.   Geographic differences are highlighted in a new study by aninternational team of scientists who compared insulin-dependentdiabetes rates in children under age 15 from 14 countries. Theirwork appears in the August issue of the journal Diabetes.   Rates ranged from 1.7 cases per 100,000 ``person-years'' inHokkaido, Japan, to 29.5 cases per 100,000 person-years in Finland.A person-year is like a man-hour; it represents the equivalent offollowing one person for one year.   Within the United States, the rates per 100,000 person-yearsalso showed variation: 9.4 in San Diego, 11.4 in Jefferson County,Ala., 13.4 in Allegheny County, Penn., 15.1 in Colorado, 17.8 inNorth Dakota and 20.8 in Rochester.   The study's overall variation was most pronounced for childrenyounger than 5, suggesting the unknown environmental agent mayexert more influence in that population, said LaPorte. ``It seemsto be affecting the youngest children the most, whatever it is.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Aug. 25</NOTE></DOC>
