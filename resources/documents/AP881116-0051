His meetings in Washingtonthis week with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany and with PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher of Britain are his first with foreignleaders as president-elect.   Here is an inventory compiled by Associated Press correspondentsaround the world of the major foreign problems that will occupy thenew president:</TEXT><TEXT>   WESTERN EUROPE _ In addition to defense issues, a dozen nationswill form a single market in 1992, removing many trade barriers andperhaps posing new problems for American trade policy. Many believethe new European trade policy will extend to politics. That couldcreate more diverse political positions among Western Europeancountries, especially in their approaches to relations with theSoviet Union and the Eastern bloc. A Britain led by Mrs. Thatcherseems likely to remain America's strongest backer in Europe.</TEXT><TEXT>   NATO _ Bush will have to deal with a NATO alliance trying todecide on upgrading its nuclear arsenal, sharing defense costs andpreparing a response to a changing Soviet Union. A relaxation oftensions may mean a more unified Western Europe that will end U.S.domination of NATO.  </TEXT><TEXT>   SOVIET UNION _ The superpowers will be trying to find ways tobreak a deadlock in strategic arms reduction talks to follow theagreement on medium-range weapons. A key aspect is whether Bush willwant to go ahead with President Reagan's ``Star Wars'' missiledefense plan, a program strongly opposed by the Kremlin.   With President Mikhail S. Gorbachev trying to revitalize theSoviet economy, a new U.S. administration will have to decidewhether to seek increased trade with Moscow and whether to joinother Western countries in offering credits to help the Soviet Unionmodernize.   U.S.-Soviet points of friction in Latin America, Afghanistan andsouthern Africa remain on the agenda.</TEXT><TEXT>   EASTERN EUROPE _ There are forces for change at work in thecountries that have formed a buffer between the Soviet Union and theWest since World War II. The countries are as different as Poland _whose government is wrestling with a political opposition and a weakeconomy _ and East Germany, which has a fairly strong economy andsome doubts about the need for Gorbachev-style reforms.   But Gorbachev's drive for reform probably will generate change incountries like Hungary and Czechoslovakia where there isdissatisfaction with the political and economic situation. TheUnited States will have to respond to attempts to move toward a moredemocratic political system and will have to develop policy oneconomic relations with the East bloc nations.</TEXT><TEXT>   MIDEAST _ The Arab-Israeli conflict, with the Palestinian issueat its core, will remain the most difficult problem in this region.There has been little progress in getting peace talks started, andthe United States will have to balance its strong ties to Israelwith attempts to maintain good relations with Arab nations.   There is a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, but that has not ledto an improvement in U.S. relations with Iran. The issue of nineAmerican hostages, some of them held by groups that support Iran,remains one of the difficult problems for the new administration.   The United States sent a navy force to the Persian Gulf toprotect shipping from Iranian attack. But if the Aug. 20 cease-fireholds, Bush may want to scale down the U.S. presence.</TEXT><TEXT>   AFRICA _ The United States has been involved in relief and aidfor African countries suffering drought and famine, but the focushas been on U.S. efforts to end South African occupation ofSouth-West Africa and to get 50,000 Cuban troops out of Angola.Political decisions will have to be made on such issues as supportto South Africa, where the policy of apartheid is under attack, andwhether to continue arms supplies to Jonas Savimbi, who is wagingwar against the Angolan government.</TEXT><TEXT>   ASIA _ Japan and the ``little dragons'' _ South Korea, Hong Kong,Taiwan and Singapore _ challenge the United States on trade and thebattle for markets. Should the United States devalue the dollar toreduce trade deficits? Should it risk alienating friends and alliesby pressing those countries hard on economic issues?   China has opened the door to capitalist investment and Vietnamwill need encouragement to withdraw from Cambodia and to account forAmericans missing from the Vietnam War.   Any rapprochement between the Soviet Union and China will forceBush to calculate strategic balances in Asia, a problem complicatedby the reluctance of the Philippines to keep huge U.S. bases.</TEXT><TEXT>   LATIN AMERICA _ The United States _ and American banks _ willhave to deal with the heavy debts of many Latin American countries,including Mexico with a $104 billion debt.   Problems with Mexico include drugs, Mexican resentment of U.S.pressure on the drug issue and the continued Mexican migration tothe United States.   Bush will have to decide what to do about the Contra rebels thatthe United States supported in their battle with the Sandinistagovernment of Nicaragua. Will he press for more aid or seekresettlement of the thousands of rebels based in Honduras?   El Salvador, strongly supported by the United States, facesincreased attack by leftist guerrillas and the terminal illness ofPresident Jose Naoleon Duarte. The rightists could win elections inMarch.</TEXT><TEXT>   CANADA _ Bush could be confronted with a major upheaval inU.S.-Canadian relations if a free trade agreement Reagan negotiatedwith Prime Minister Brian Mulroney is rejected by Canadians inMonday's election. If it is, both sides may be wary of of enteringnew trade talks. Canada and the United States are each other'slargest trading partners, with trade amounting to $150 billion ayear.   Canadians hope a Bush administration will make progress on acidrain, one of the most troublesome issues with the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
