Marcospledged his support to President Corazon Aquino on Saturday andpromised that if she let him come home for his mother's funeral, hewould not try a coup.   About 5,000 people rallied to demand that Marcos be allowed toattend the funeral of his mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who diedMay 4. She was 95. No date for the funeral has been set. Familymembers have been hoping Mrs. Aquino would change her mind aboutMarcos attending.   Mrs. Aquino ruled out allowing Marcos to return. The governmentalso said Saturday that Marcos must repay the billions he allegedlystole during his 20 years in power before he can come home fromexile in Hawaii and ordered its consulate in Hawaii to block hisreturn.   Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad read Marcos' statement bytelephone from Hawaii, where Marcos lives in exile. In thestatement, broadcast by Manila radio stations, Marcos promised hewould not exploit his return to undermine her government.   ``I reiterate that I oppose violence, that I have no intentionof mounting a coup d'etat or causing a civil war,'' the Marcosstatement said. ``I, therefore, advise my supporters and those whoare fighting for the very same democratic principles that I standfor not to engage in any disruptive and more violent activities.''   But in a telegram to the Philippine consulate in Honolulu, thepresidential palace said Mrs. Aquino remained convinced Marcos'return would undermine national security.   Marcos supporters have been linked to several attempts to topplethe Aquino government.   The telegram, released by the palace to news organizations, alsosaid Mrs. Aquino would ``allow him to come back if he returns allthe wealth he stole from the country.''   Mrs. Aquino's government claims Marcos and his associatessiphoned off up to $10 billion during his 20-year administrationbefore he fled after a February 1986 popular uprising.   Marcos' statement also urged his supporters to ``join forceswith Madame Aquino'' to oppose communist rebels and others who``challenge the stability of the current government.''   The ousted president said that allowing him to return would``not only adhere to the noble principle of humanitarianism butalso would unite various political forces ... into an overpoweringforce which would prevent bloodshed ... and at the same time solvethe present economic sufferings of our people.''   On Friday, Marcos claimed he was negotiating with Manila andWashington to return for the funeral.   Mrs. Aquino's spokesman, Teodoro Benigno, said Friday'sstatement was meaningless, and U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt toldreporters that American officials ``just haven't been involved atall'' in negotiations regarding Marcos' return.   Marcos loyalists gathered in 100-degree weather Saturday andmarched to the Mendiola Bridge about 300 yards from thepresidential palace. March leader Salvador Panelo said they wouldremain there until Mrs. Aquino reversed her decision or Marcosappeared before them. But by sundown, the crowd had largelydispersed.   Protesters carried banners reading ``Give Us Marcos or Give UsDeath.'' Others claimed Marcos was the only one who could stop thecommunist insurgency, which erupted and spread nationwide duringhis administration.   Also Saturday, a bomb exploded at military headquarters, killingone soldier, officials said. The building has been vacant sincebeing set ablaze during an August coup attempt.   Navy Lt. Anselmo Cabingan, a military spokesman, said the victimwas believed to be a member of a roving guard force and apparentlypicked up an explosive device left after the coup plot failed.   ``It's an accident,'' Cabingan said. ``It`s not connected withanything political or whatever. It's just a simple accident as wesee it.''</TEXT></DOC>
