The New York Post reported Wednesday that most of the questionedfootage was shot by Mike Hoover, 45, a free-lancer who covered thewar on a story-by-story basis for CBS and won an Oscar in 1985 fora short live-action film called ``Up.''   ``I'm going to have to look into it,'' CBS Broadcast GroupPresident Howard Stringer, a former CBS News president, said of theclaims in the Post, which cited ``military and media sources'' inthe United States, Europe and Asia.   The Post, quoting an Afghan rebel who it said served as Hoover'stranslator, reported that Hoover staged scenes of guerrillasabotage. The paper also quoted a defense consultant as saying thecameraman passed off pictures of a Chinese-made Pakistani jetfighter on a training mission as a Soviet-made jet bombing Afghanvillages in 1986.   Stringer was executive producer of anchorman Dan Rather's ``CBSEvening News'' but left it in January 1984, 10 months before thedisputed footage aired in two reports. The reports won thebroadcast a prestigious Columbia-du Pont Silver Baton award.   In the broadcasts, film shot by Hoover showed Mujahedeen rebelsreportedly blowing up pylons to cut power to the Afghan capital ofKabul during the war that began in 1979.   The actual sabotage, the Post said, occurred 12 days beforeHoover arrived on the scene.   A rebel serving as Hoover's translator told the newspaper thatHoover persuaded rebel leaders to order about a dozen of theirtroops back to the site so he could stage the explosions, accordingto the newspaper, identifying the translator only as Etabari.   ``We can't respond to the story until we talk to the free-lancecameraman involved,'' said CBS spokesman Tom Goodman.   Hoover was unavailable for comment. A woman who the Post saididentified herself as his wife said he was working in remote cavesin New Zealand and couldn't be contacted.   ``It is the goal of CBS in every instance to gather and reportthe news accurately, fairly and with integrity. In the case of theAfghan war, we believe we have done so,'' CBS News president DavidBurke said in a statement.   Rather did not immediately return calls.   Stringer declined to comment on the Post story, saying he hadn'tread it. ``I don't know who the people involved are or who theaccusations are coming from,'' he said.   In a 1987 Los Angeles Times interview, Hoover explained that heproposed coverage of the Afghan war on a story-by-story basis andnever was turned down. He said Rather was ``really the muscle''behind his CBS assignments.   The Denver-born Hoover also said in the interview he didn'tregard himself as a news cameraman in the traditional sense. ``I'mreally kind of a filmmaker,'' he said.   Perry Wolff, executive producer of a ``CBS Reports'' documentaryin 1987 _ an Emmy-winner called ``The Battle For Afghanistan'' thatused some of the questioned footage _ did not return phone calls.Rather narrated that documentary.   This summer, a CBS source said, Wolff was suspended by CBS Newsafter the disclosure that a July special on man's first walk on themoon identified footage taken in 1972 as having occurred during thefirst moon walk in 1969.   Wolff called it ``an honest mistake'' and blamed a mislabeledtape. Both he and CBS News spokesmen have refused to confirm ordeny that he was suspended.   The Post also quoted H. Joachim Maitre, dean of BostonUniversity's College of Communications, as saying CBS News in 1987bought footage stolen from Mohamed Salam, an Afghan journalismstudent at the school.   The Post said Rather, on a ``CBS Evening News'' broadcast, latershowed the footage and described it as a ``the biggest one-daydefeat for Soviet forces since World War II,'' when in fact,according to Maitre, there'd been no such battle.   What the tape actually showed, Maitre said, was a small,successful rebel attack against Afghan government troops. He saidhe asked for and got an apology from CBS.   Maitre, an East German defector known for conservative politicalviews, was not available for comment, his office said. A secretarythere said he was at an all-day conference on defense journalism inWashington.</TEXT></DOC>
