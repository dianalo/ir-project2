Some think it could get worse if South Africa grows really riled about the talk of tougher U.S. sanctions.    South Africa, rich in strategic materials, is the Western world's chief supplier of ferrochrome, an essential raw ingredient of stainless steel. Stainless steel is a major product of such U.S. companies as Allegheny Ludlum and Carpenter Technology. And ferrochrome now is in short supply, particularly in the U.S.    If U.S. specialty steelmakers can't get enough of the material, production could be affected and investors' recent enthusiasm for the companies' shares could wane, says John Brimelow, director of international research at Keane Securities in New York, a specialist in metals and South African stocks.    In a quarterly filing, Allegheny Ludlum says &quot;availability of raw materials could limit the output of specialty materials&quot; by the company and its competitors if demand keeps rising. Donald Powell, a Merrill Lynch analyst, says U.S. output of stainless steel has been running about 20% higher than last year.    In recent days, American Metal Market, a trade publication, has written of a &quot;scramble&quot; by U.S. steel mills for the critical material at rising prices. Spot prices for ferrochrome have soared to more than $1 a pound, compared with only about 40 cents a pound in early 1987.    Japanese and European mills are said to be in better shape, in some cases holding big inventories: They have tended to secure raw materials under long-term contracts, while U.S. mills fill more of their needs in the spot market.    Currently, only about 47% of U.S. ferrochrome needs are filled through South African contracts, priced at about 71 cents a pound. Analysts say much of the remaining 53% probably is being filled at high market-related prices. Alternate suppliers, including such countries as Albania, the Philippines, Greece and France, aren't believed to be offering contracts at below market prices.    Ben Nolte, president of the U.S. marketing arm of Samancor, South Africa's top ferrochrome producer, says &quot;the burning question&quot; is whether other suppliers to the U.S. &quot;will be able to maintain&quot; high levels of exports. France has been selling ferrochrome from its stockpile, he says. He sees the ferrochrome squeeze lasting into 1989's first or second quarter before easing.    Thus U.S. mills apparently face uncertainty regarding a big chunk of their ferrochrome supplies. The material is generally a bigger component -- although a smaller cost factor -- in stainless steel than nickel. The ferrochrome flap comes atop a sharp surge in prices for nickel and scrap metal in the past year.    A spokesman for Allegheny Ludlum says the company, &quot;undoubtedly the largest {U.S.} buyer of chromium for stainless steel,&quot; is watching the ferrochrome market closely, particularly in light of &quot;rumors&quot; that prices may go higher. He won't say how much of Allegheny's ferrochrome is bought in the spot market, although &quot;in our buying procedures, we pursue all methods.&quot; Currently, he says, &quot;We have adequate supplies and our customers' orders are protected.&quot; He adds that &quot;ups and downs&quot; in raw-material prices are being passed to customers in the form of surcharges. Carpenter didn't return calls.    No big ferrochrome buyer will reveal its needs, in case suppliers raise prices, says one industry executive. Of course, the ferrochrome flap could subside if, as some analysts expect, the stainless-steel boom slows.    Specialty-steel stocks have had a run-up in 1988. Allegheny, although weak in recent days, has climbed to 28 7/8 from 21 3/8. Carpenter has climbed to 47 5/8 from 40. Because of the gain, Merrill's Mr. Powell isn't recommending Carpenter anymore. Goldman Sachs's Wayne Atwell, among the few analysts who track Allegheny Ludlum, isn't recommending it.    Keane's Mr. Brimelow wonders: &quot;Does the South African government want to be mean to the Americans?&quot; If so, it could limit supplies of ferrochrome and other strategic metals. A bill that would ban most South African imports -- excluding metals like ferrochrome -- has passed the House. While it faces opposition in the Senate and may not pass in this session, it already has angered many South Africans.    Robert Irwin of Niagara Share Corp., a closed-end fund in Buffalo, N.Y., recently visited South Africa. He said the ruling Afrikaner establishment's right wing is inclined &quot;to take a hard line on exports&quot; to the U.S. -- to adopt &quot;counter-sanctions.&quot; Two weeks ago, a prominent Afrikaner remarked to him, &quot;The U.S. has written us off; we're going to write them off.&quot;    Niagara Share owns stock in Samancor, where executives figure demand for ferrochrome in 1988 might exceed supply by 20%. Ferrochrome production capacity is expected to rise in the next two yearsmainly in South Africa.    Samancor's Mr. Nolte says it doesn't make sense &quot;from a business standpoint&quot; for South Africa to hit back at U.S. customers. But some think this is happening. South African contract prices for ferrochrome are currently somewhat higher for Americans than for Europeans, a departure from tradition. Niagara Share's Mr. Irwin says South Africa is &quot;taking care of loyal customers.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
