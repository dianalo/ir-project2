East Germany on Saturday agreed to the exodus after a remarkableaccord between Soviet bloc and NATO nations ended a deadlock thatforced many of the refugees to spend weeks camping outside theembassies.   The first train carrying about 780 East Germans who had soughtrefuge in the West German embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia arrivedin the Bavarian city of Hof at 6:14 a.m. (1:14 a.m EDT). Severalhundred local residents applauded and cheered as the train pulledinto the station.   The agreement announced Saturday covered nearly 3,500 EastGermans who began crowding into the embassy in Prague several weeksago and more than 800 East Germans at the embassy in Warsaw, Poland.   Early Sunday, Bavarian Radio in West Germany said about half the3,500 refugees in Prague were en route.   In Poland 809 refugees boarded an East German train that leftWarsaw's Eastern Station before dawn Sunday, headed for the WestGerman border city of Helmstedt.   The accord and its details were announced by officials in WestGermany, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Poland.   East Germany, a hard-line Communist nation that had harshlycriticized Warsaw Pact ally Hungary for allowing a similar refugeeexodus earlier this month, said it was granting the transfer as a``humanitarian act'' and spoke of the refugees being ``expelled.''   There was no explicit mention of the policy toward futurerefugees, but ADN, the official East German news agency, said EastGermany hoped West Germany would follow ``normal, internationalcustoms'' at its embassies abroad after the transfer.   That appeared to indicate East Germany would oppose continuingemigration of its citizens to the West. West German officials inBonn could not be reached for comment Saturday night.   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher made anunexpected visit to Prague Saturday and delivered the news tojubilant East Germans at the embassy.   ``I call you fellow citizens, and express a hearty welcome,''Genscher, speaking from an embassy balcony, told the weary butecstatic masses huddled in the muddy compound.   He told reporters the solution was agreed on early Saturday inconsultations with the East Germans, Czechoslovaks and Poles.   Some of the refugees had spent weeks huddled in tents and oncots in the embassy compound amid growing crowding, spreadingdisease and worsening weather.   The first train left Prague Saturday night. An olive green EastGerman locomotive left the city's northern rail terminal at 8:50p.m. local time pulling nine passenger cars.   About 400 East Germans were on board _ some cheering, otherssinging, still others appearing a little dazed by the sudden end totheir ordeal.   ``We are coming, we are coming,'' a group of young refugeesyelled in unison from an open train window, as Czechoslovakuniformed police looked on impassively,   A young woman from Dresden said as she was about to board: ``Ican't believe it, tell me it's not a dream.''   ADN said trains were to carry the Prague emigres back to EastGermany from Czechoslovakia and on to West Germany. Czechoslovakstate television said the East Germans were to be issued exitpapers while en route to West Germany.   The route was seen as a face-saving measure permitting EastGermany to say that it had allowed the emigres to go to WestGermany from its territory and not from Czechoslovakia, a WarsawPact ally that had vowed not to allow the transfer.   In Munich, West Germany, a Bavarian goverment spokesman said bytelephone he believed the trains would leave in intervals of abouttwo hours, with the first expected in the Bavarian city of Hofearly Sunday.   The refugees will be housed in emergency quarters maintained bythe Bavarian border police, said a police spokesman. The Bavarianofficial and the police spokesmen spoke on condition of anonymity.   In Poland, the East Germans assembled at the West German Embassyin Warsaw.   The refugees, some of whom had been allowed to stay in nearbyresidential neighborhoods, reacted with cheering and weeping.   ``I am happy; I am happy'' one young man said through the barsof the compound gates.   West German law automatically granting East Germans citizenshipon arrival has contributed to more than 100,000 East Germansfleeing to West Germany so far this year.   The East Germans have flooded to West Germany because ofdisillusionment with political repression and economic stagnationin their homeland.   More than 23,000 East Germans emigrated over Hungary's westernborder since Sept. 10, when Hungarian authorities authorized freepassage to Austria of East Germans seeking a new life in the West.   Hundreds of like-minded East Germans, allowed unhindered travelinto neighboring Czechoslovakia but without the necessary documentsfor Hungary, began crowding the West German Embassy in Prague weeksago.   Others crossed illegally from Czechoslovakia into Hungary toflee West. But hundreds more asked for sanctuary at the embassy inPrague after Czechoslovak authorities turned them back at theborder or began confiscating visas valid for Hungary in an apparenteffort to stanch the westward flow of East Germans.   East Germany, Czechoslovakia and other hard-line Warsaw Pactcountries have been critical of reform-minded Hungary forpermitting the exodus.   In East Berlin, ADN quoted East German Foreign Ministryspokesman, Wolfgang Meyer, as saying:   ``In efforts to end the intolerable situation at the West Germanembassies in Prague and Warsaw that was not brought about by EastGermany, the East German government ... arranged that these peopleillegally at the embassies will be expelled to West Germany acrossEast German territory with trains of the (West German) railroad.''   Asked for details on the agreement to let the East Germansemigrate, a West German government spokesman in Bonn referred totalks Genscher conducted in recent days outside of a session of theU.N. General Assembly in New York.   Genscher had met with his Czechoslovak, East German, Polish,Soviet, U.S. and French counterparts about the refugee standoffs.</TEXT></DOC>
