Collier, a former director of Morgan Grenfell Group PLC's securities unit, received a one-year suspended jail sentence and a #25,000 ($40,440) fine after he pleaded guilty to two charges of insider trading.    Mr. Collier, 37 years old, faced as many as four years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine for the charges. Once a leading figure in London's securities markets, he yesterday admitted insider trading in the shares of two British companies, AE PLC and Cadbury Schweppes PLC. Prosecutors dropped four related allegations. A judge ordered Mr. Collier to also pay #7,000 in court costs.    Mr. Collier's case was the government's first brought under a 1985 insider-trading law. The case also represented the first of a series of scandals that have rocked the City, London's financial district, since its &quot;Big Bang&quot; deregulation last fall.    &quot;I am extremely grateful to have the opportunity to rebuild my life and my career,&quot; Mr. Collier said as he left London's Central Criminal Court yesterday.    Members of the opposition Labor Party, however, attacked Mr. Collier's suspended prison sentence as inadequate. &quot;He has been let off with a pat on the back,&quot; said Jeremy Corbyn, a Labor member of Parliament. &quot;It is a disgrace when compared to the way that poor people are treated for shoplifting offenses.&quot;    The United Kingdom's Department of Trade and Industry declined to comment on yesterday's sentence. But a spokeswoman said the government has planned to introduce legislation this year that would increase the maximum prison term for insider trading to seven years from two years.    Justice Donald Farquharson issued a stern warning to the City as he sentenced Mr. Collier. &quot;In recent times, it has been clear that you and others like you have stooped to conduct that blemishes the reputation&quot; of the City, the judge said. &quot;It had better be understood that if these kind of offenses are repeated,&quot; judges in future cases &quot;may not feel able to suspend sentences of imprisonment.&quot;    Last November, Mr. Collier abruptly quit Morgan Grenfell Securities Holdings Ltd., the big U.K. merchant bank's unit, after admitting to company executives that he had traded 60,000 AE shares earlier that month. The British engineering company at the time was the target of a #265 million takeover bid by Hollis PLC, a British furniture maker that Morgan Grenfell was advising.    Completion of Mr. Collier's AE transactions would have netted him roughly #15,000 in profit, Robin Auld, the government's prosecutor, said in court yesterday. He added that Mr. Collier didn't receive the profit because London stockbrokers Scrimgeour Vickers canceled the trades Nov. 4 when the firm began to suspect the shares had been traded illegally.    Mr. Collier later told government investigators that he ordered options to buy 150,000 shares of Cadbury Schweppes last Oct. 15, according to Mr. Auld. Throughout last fall, U.S.-based General Cinema Corp. was acquiring shares of the U.K. candy and soft-drink concern while being advised by Morgan Grenfell Inc. of New York, another Morgan Grenfell unit.    The Cadbury Schweppes transaction involved a #10,000 loss for Mr. Collier, Mr. Auld said. Cadbury's share-option price fell in late October, but Mr. Collier sold the options on Nov. 3 as suspicions about the AE share trades &quot;were beginning to come to light,&quot; Mr. Auld also told the court.    The former Morgan Grenfell executive may lose his membership on London's Stock Exchange as a result of yesterday's sentencing. The exchange will decide &quot;fairly soon&quot; whether to revoke Mr. Collier's membership, which he has held since March 1986, a spokeswoman said. Mr. Collier offered to resign his exchange seat when he left Morgan Grenfell. But the exchange postponed a decision until after Mr. Collier's trial    Instead of revoking Mr. Collier's membership, thespokeswoman went on, the exchange might &quot;publicly censure&quot;him, fine him an unspecified sum or suspend him for anunspecified period.   In a related development, the Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that it may appoint independent inspectors to investigate 11 other cases of alleged insider trading. Independent inspectors already are investigating three cases of suspected insider trading. The government agency gained the power to appoint independent inspectors as part of last year's Financial Services Act. </TEXT></DOC>
