The Senate decided by voice vote to forbid cigarette smoking onall domestic airline routes after routing an effort by tobaccoindustry supporters to block the provision.   Earlier, the Senate sent President Bush a separate measurecontaining $225 million to begin construction of the government'slatest boon for Texas, the $5 billion super conducting supercollider.   Final passage of the $11.9 billion transportation bill for fiscal1990 containing the smoking restrictions was held up by a disputeover unrelated anti-drug spending.   But when that comes, the next step will be for Senate-Housenegotiators to write compromise legislation that can be sent toPresident Bush. The House last month approved a milder version ofthe ban which would permanently bar smoking on flights of two hoursor shorter.   Lobbyist Jo Ellen Deutsch of the Association of FlightAttendants, one of several airline unions working for the total ban,said lobbyists were trying to discern the leanings of lawmakers whowill negotiate on the measure.   ``You can bet the ones who are unsure or leaning the other waywill be hearing from us over the next few days,'' she said.   Spokesman Gary Miller of the cigarette industry's trade group,the Tobacco Institute, said his side had not given up hope of toningdown the restrictions.   ``It's not the law yet,'' he said. ``It's our positive outlookthat less extreme legislation will be the result'' of theHouse-Senate bargaining.   In the showdown 77-21 vote Thursday, senators forced a halt todelaying tactics pro-smoking lawmakers had hoped would lead tolooser restrictions.   ``We didn't undertake that vote in the belief we could defeat''the proposed ban, Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., who fought the proposal,conceded.   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who sponsored the ban proposal andwho cited health concerns about lingering cigarette smoke in airlinecabins, said, ``The American people are overwhelmingly in support ofthis suspension of smoking on airliners.''   The Senate version would extend the ban to all U.S. routes 95days after the bill becomes law. Current restrictions prohibitsmoking on flights of two hours or less _ four-fifths of all routes_ and will otherwise expire next April.   Passengers caught smoking would be subject to $1,000 fines andpeople found to have disabled smoke detectors in aircraft restroomswould face penalties of up to $2,000.   Opponents of the ban argued there is no proof that cigarettefumes harm nonsmokers, and that the smoke is merely one of manychemicals adrift in the recirculated air inside airliners. Theycalled on supporters to await a Transportation Department study onairliner air quality expected by early next year.   They also said the restriction would hurt tobacco growers.   But supporters cited several studies concluding that nonsmokersrisk cancer and other diseases by so-called passive smoking and saidthere was no reason to wait for a total prohibition.   The money for the Texas atom smasher was part of an $18.6 billionenergy and water measure approved on a voice vote. Bush, a Texasresident, is expected to sign the bill.   The circular, 53-mile-long supercollider is to be built 25 milessouth of Dallas. Scientists will use it to hurtle proton beams intoeach other in a search for the basic building blocks of matter.   The measure also contains $1.6 billion towards cleaning up thenation's nuclear weapons plants, about 70 percent more than the $975million provided this year and 27 percent more than Bush requested.The overall task of removing radioactive waste from the facilitieshas been estimated at $100 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
