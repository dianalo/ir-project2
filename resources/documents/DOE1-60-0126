Introduction to interstate natural gas pipelines that couldmove gas inexpensively caused many plants to cease production in theearly 1950s. As a result, many abandoned or nonoperating gas manufacturingsites have become part of our environmental legacies. Because gas plantwastes and by-products were disposed of on many of these sites, the utilityindustry, regulatory agencies, and general public are becoming increasinglyconcerned about the environmental risks and associated liabilities posedby these sites. Although physical conditions at no two sites are alike,the nature of material disposed, waste management practices, and regulatoryissues are similar in many situations. Accordingly this paper providesa general introduction to the key factors in the development and implementationof environmental activities at these former gas plant sites. A briefhistorical review of the development of this industry and the processesused will be covered. The kinds of wastes of concern and their potentialfor an environmental impact, the government regulations associated withassessment and remediation of former gas plant sites, and options availablefor conduct of site reconnaissance and remediation are presented. Gasstudies based on Keystone's experience with such sites will also be presentedto provide specific examples of various options that can be considered.</TEXT></DOC>
