The court told the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court to decidewhether a since-amended state law can be used to prosecute DouglasOakes, 40, of Holden, Mass., for ``soliciting a child to pose ... ina state of nudity ... for pornographic purposes.''   Today's ruling is a setback for Oakes, who had been freed fromany criminal liability by the state's highest court.   Oakes was criminally convicted in Worcester County. Prosecutorssaid that in 1984 he induced his 14-year-old stepdaughter to posefor photographs while clothed only in bikini underpants and a scarf.   Police were contacted after the girl's mother discovered thephotos.   Oakes was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and was paroled aftertwo years.   The state's highest court threw out Oakes' conviction anddismissed the criminal indictment against him. The state court saidthe 1982 law under which Oakes was prosecuted was too broad, andcriminalized ``conduct that virtually every person would regard aslawful.''   ``For example,'' the state court said in its ruling, ``(the law)makes a criminal of a parent who takes a frontal view picture of hisor her naked 1-year-old running on a beach or romping in a wadingpool.''   The law later was amended to add a ``lascivious intent''requirement.   Today's decision was accompanied by three written opinions but nomajority opinion attracting at least five justices.   Four of the court's members, led by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,said the issue of whether the original Massachusetts law wasoverbroad became moot when it was amended.   Two justices _ Antonin Scalia and Harry A. Blackmun _ voted toreverse the Massachusetts court and rule that Oakes' prosecution wasconstitutional.   ``Perhaps I am wrong in my estimation of how frequently theposings prohibited by (the old law) are done for artistic purposes,or for family photographs, or in some other legitimate andconstitutionally protected context I have not envisioned,'' Scaliawrote in an opinion joined by Blackmun.   ``We can deal with such a situation in the unlikely event someprosecutor brings an indictment,'' he said.   Three justices _ William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and JohnPaul Stevens _ said the court should uphold the state court decisionand rule that the original child-porn law violated free-speechrights.   Writing for the three, Brennan noted that the American SunbathingAssociation, a nudist group, told the court that photographs takenof its 30,000 members in the United States and Canada could lead toprosecutions under the old Massachusetts law.   The case is Massachusetts vs. Oakes, 87-1651.</TEXT></DOC>
