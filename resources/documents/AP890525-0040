The somber Shanghai procession featured huge wreaths of flowersto remember comrades in Beijing that an epitath said were``sacrificed for democracy.''   The only problem: nobody died.   Without a free press at a time of great social and politicalturmoil, China has been taken over by rumors.   From student loudspeakers, official government sources,journalists and the man on the street, the flow of hints andinnuendoes is unceasing.   Sometimes the rumors are created to sully an enemy or aid afriend. Sometimes it seems all of Beijing is playing a giganticgame of ``telephone,'' with no goal other than the passing ofstrange information.   Chinese with a political ax to grind are putting out false ordistorted information to benefit whichever faction they support.Others, reveling in their life on the inside track, are relayingthe stories with all the glee of small-town gossips.   The situation is so bad the government outlawed rumor-mongeringin Beijing when it declared martial law on Saturday.   Widespread student rumors included an imminent attack onTiananmen Square, which student protesters have occupied, byparatroopers and the electrification of subway grates byauthorities.   But the rumors are not confined to the student movement.   Within one week, various sources reported that Communist Partychief Zhao Ziyang had resigned, returned to power and then wasforced out again.   Other rumors said Premier Li Peng and three other conservativeshad seized power. Then there was the story that Li and seniorleader Deng Xiaoping had stepped down and that President YangShangkun, a former general, was poised to stage a coup.   A government source said someone he know in the State Council,China's Cabinet, told him Li had resigned and that the resignationwould be broadcast on state-run television that night.   ``I called the TV station and a friend there started laughing.It just wasn't true but this thing came from the State Council,''he said.   Zhang Weiguo, a reporter on the World Economic Herald, arelatively liberal newspaper based in Shanghai, said the rumor millshows how badly China needs a freer press.   ``People are learning about major government changes and aboutthe biggest student movement in China's history from popsiclesellers and newspaper dealers,'' he said. ``This is not a way toinform the people.''   Indeed, after several days in early May when the official mediagave lively objective reports about the student movement, the presshas returned to somber reporting, pockmarked with an occasionalshrill editorial calling for stability.</TEXT></DOC>
