In a 10-page statement of claim filed yesterday with the Federal Court of Canada, Rothmans's 60%-owned Rothmans, Benson andamp; Hedges Inc. unit said the law is unconstitutional and helps entrench Imperial Tobacco Ltd. as Canada's cigarette market leader.    Specifically, the Rothmans unit, which ranks second to Imperial in Canadian cigarette sales, said in its filing that the Tobacco Products Control Act violates Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms by placing curbs on free expression, including &quot;freedom of the press and other media of communication.&quot;    An attorney who represents Rothmans said the company also seeks an injunction to halt prosecutions under the new law, which was passed last month in the face of strong tobacco industry opposition. He said he is optimistic the suit will be heard before year end.    Officials in the office of federal Health Minister Jake Epp, who introduced the legislation last year, weren't available for comment.    Rothmans president and chief executive officer, Patrick Fennell, said after the company's annual meeting, where the suit was announced, that the advertising ban &quot;represents an extreme and discriminatory intervention&quot; in the market that &quot;blocks the free flow of information about a legal product and emasculates competition.&quot;    Under the new law, tobacco advertising in Canadian newspapers and magazines will be banned Jan. 1, and tobacco advertisements on signs and billboards will be phased out by 1991. The law also will restrict retail displays of tobacco products and curtail sponsorship of sports and cultural events by tobacco companies.    Tobacco advertising on Canadian radio and television was banned several years ago.    Wilmat Tennyson, president and chief operating officer of Imperial, a unit of Montreal-based Imasco Ltd., wouldn't comment on Rothmans's contention that the law strengthens Imperial's market leadership. He noted that the ban doesn't affect advertisements in U.S. magazines that are distributed in Canada. Such advertisements account for about two-thirds of the tobacco advertising that Canadians see.    Mr. Tennyson said it's unfair that foreign cigarette manufacturers who advertise through U.S. magazines will escape the ban.    The Rothmans tobacco unit is 40%-owned by Philip Morris Inc., New York, whose cigarette brands, including Benson andamp; Hedges, are advertised heavily in Canada through U.S. magazines. </TEXT></DOC>
