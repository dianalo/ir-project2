Dravo, a supplier of lime and aggregates, said Drillbit agreed not to solicit proxies for a year and, additionally, to support the company's own slate of nominees for board election at an April 28 annual meeting.    The move damped any lingering speculation that Drillbit, a partnership led by New Jersey investor Arthur Goldberg holding a 6.8% stake in Dravo, might attempt to take over the troubled company.    In an interview yesterday, Mr. Goldberg said he agreed to back Dravo's board nominees after Dravo agreed to name J. Kenneth Looloian, an executive vice president of International Controls Corp., to a new seat on its board.    But both Dravo and Mr. Goldberg said Mr. Looloian, 64 years old, will be an independent director and won't necessarily support Drillbit's views. Asked if Dravo refused to name a director affiliated with Drillbit, Mr. Goldberg said, &quot;I don't think that's accurate.&quot;    Mr. Goldberg denied that the agreement had diminished any leverage he might have had over Dravo. &quot;We will not be a passive shareholder,&quot; he said, adding that he still thinks Dravo will consider a sale &quot;if the price were right.&quot;    Analysts, though, found Mr. Goldberg's move puzzling and said they expect Dravo to continue with its strategy as previously planned. &quot;I was surprised that he (Goldberg) would have backed down,&quot; said Gregory M. Drahuschak, a Butcher andamp; Singer Inc. analyst.    Last month, in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Drillbit said it wanted immediate board representation and threatened to wage a proxy contest for four seats. Drillbit also urged Dravo to consider &quot;seriously and expeditiously&quot; the sale or liquidation of the company.    Dravo spurned Mr. Goldberg's proposal almost immediately, saying it would continue with its planned restructuring. The company said that either a sale or a liquidation was ill-advised due to the tax consequences.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Dravo shares closed at $13, off 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
