These include high severity catalytic reforming,alkylation, catalytic polymerization of propylene, isomerization of lightnaphtha (C/sub 5//C/sub 6/) or the production of one or more of a numberof high octane oxygenated fuel components. This paper discusses the comparativemerits of the prinicipal oxygentated fuel technologies, including methanol,ethanol isopropyl alcohol, tertiary butyl alcohol, mixed alcohols, methyltertiary butyl ether and tertiary amyl methyl ether. All of these fuelcomponents utilize feedstocks that are readily available in Canada. Thefinal decision on which, if any, of the alcohols or ethers to considermust be based on a number of factors including feedstock availability,processing alternatives available to the refiner, blending characteristicsof the various oxygenated fuels with the refiner's gasoline blendstock,and economics. 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
