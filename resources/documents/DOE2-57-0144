Adequacy of themodel of phase tree to the real phase complex is proved experimentallyusing complex DTA and X-ray phase analysis of secant elements. The procedureof differentiation and construction of phase tree can be the finite stageof investigation or the intermediate link to detect chemism, to constructcrystallization tree during quantitative description of the system atthe second information level.</TEXT></DOC>
