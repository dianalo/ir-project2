Daniel Finney, a spokesman for MNC, said the Maryland bankholding company hasn't decided where to make the cuts, butsaid work force reductions and some branch closings likelywould be made. &quot;The salary line is the biggest piece of allour expenses,&quot; he said. MNC is the parent of MarylandNational Bank and American Security Bank.</LP><TEXT>   Although the Washington Post reported Friday that MNCintends to eliminate 1,000 jobs, or about 10% of its workforce, Mr. Finney said management &quot;hasn't quantified what{the expense cut} will mean for staff reductions.&quot;   Meanwhile, some shareholders are making another attempt tosue MNC for alleged fraud. A consolidated shareholder suitwas filed in the U.S. District Court in Baltimore last week,charging that MNC and some present and former officers anddirectors misrepresented the company's real estate-relatedproblems.   Those problems led MNC to report a 1990 loss of $440million, or $5.23 a share, compared with net income of $245.1million, or $2.85 a share, in 1989. In the first quarter, itreported that net soared to $154 million, or $1.75 a share,from $6.2 million, or five cents a share, a year earlier,mainly because of a $444 million pretax gain from the sale ofits credit-card business.   Frank P. Bramble, MNC's chief operating officer, recentlyinformed 80 senior MNC executives of the decision to cut $100million in expenses by year end, and told them to developwithin 90 days a plan implementing the cuts. Based onfirst-quarter expenses, a $100 million reduction in expenseswould amount to about 15%.   This is &quot;the first indication from management&quot; that thecompany is addressing costs, said John A. Bailey, an analystwith Ferris Baker Watts in Washington, D.C. Mr. Bailey saidbank officials &quot;haven't stated that they have a good ideawhere {the cuts} are going to come from.&quot; He said the cutswould be drastic because the bank is simultaneously shrinkingits assets.   MNC spun off its credit-card operations as a separatepublic company to raise cash. In addition, it sold itsconsumer finance unit, Landmark Financial Services Inc., toPrimerica Corp. in January for about $370 million. Amongother assets on the block are $500 million in highlyleveraged transactions, Mr. Finney said.   As for the shareholder suit, Richard Greenfield, leadcounsel for the plaintiffs, said it consolidates about adozen suits that had been brought against MNC. An earlierconsolidated suit was dismissed in January for lack ofinformation. Mr. Greenfield, a partner with the Haverford,Pa., law firm of Greenfield andamp; Chimicles, said &quot;there's a lotmore detail {in the new suit}, more effort to connect whatinsiders knew&quot; with what they said publicly.   The suit charges that the defendants violated federaldisclosure laws by disseminating false and misleadinginformation about the health of the company's real estateportfolio through public statements, annual and quarterlyreports, prospectuses and advertising.   Apart from MNC, the defendants in the suit are Alan P.Hoblitzell Jr., MNC's chairman until last September; DanielJ. Callahan III, MNC's former president and currently anexecutive vice president; William H. Daiger Jr., a former MNCvice chairman and chief executive officer of MarylandNational Bank and currently an MNC executive vice president;and Oliver T. Carr Jr. and A. James Clark, two developers whohad served as directors of both MNC and American SecurityBank.   The suit, which seeks unspecified damages, representsthree classes of shareholders: investors who bought shares onthe open market between Jan. 17, 1989 and Oct. 25, 1990;investors who owned shares in Equitable Bancorp. before itsmerger with MNC in January 1990; and MNC shareholders whosedividends were reinvested in the bank holding company. Theseshareholders were represented in the suit dismissed January.   Mr. Finney declined to comment on the suit except to say&quot;we are confident we acted appropriately over the periodcovered by the suit. We will continue to defend ourselvesvigorously.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
