Whether this is due to inadequatecrews or lower standards of maintenance and overhaul procedures is discussed.In particular, it is suggested that since the introduction of nuclearpowered submarines, the Soviet submarine safety record has deteriorated.Information on Soviet submarine accidents is difficult to come by, buta list of some 23 accidents, mostly in nuclear submarines, between 1966and 1986, has been compiled.
