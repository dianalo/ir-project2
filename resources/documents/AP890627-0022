They say this is more reason than ever for people to be testedfor AIDS.   ``A few years ago, the diagnosis was a death sentence,'' FrankYoung, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, toldreporters Monday in announcing FDA action on two drugs forAIDS-related conditions.   ``Now there's significant hope'' to prolong life by warding offthe infections that invade the weakened immune systems of AIDSvictims, he said. ``The good news is that there are more therapiesthat are coming to treat the disease early.''   Commercial approval was granted for the drug ganciclovir fortreatment of an eye infection that can lead to blindness in AIDSpatients. About one in every four AIDS patients gets cytomegalovirusretinitis.   The FDA also is allowing expanded pre-market distribution of anexperimental protien, r-erythropoietin, to treat severe anemia thatweakens nearly half of the 20,000 patients taking the AIDS-fightingdrug AZT.   Earlier this month, the FDA approved aerosol pentamidine toprevent pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which kills about 60 percentof AIDS victims.   ``These are important advances, but the disease still remainsdemonic,'' Young said.   Though there is still no cure or vaccine, ``people need to knowas early as possible what the diagnosis is so they can get theproper care.''   The FDA, criticized by AIDS advocates for moving too slowly ingetting promising drugs to patients, has been moving the approvalprocess more quickly while still assuring that experimental drugsare safe.   Using a special treatment category formally instituted two yearsago, the FDA allows pre-market distribution of a drug that has beenshown to be safe and may be effective. With this status, called``treatment investigational new drug,'' or treatment IND, a drug canbe distributed more widely while research on its effectivenesscontinues.   Young said the FDA has also been working with the NationalInstitutes of Health to develop another avenue designed to give moreAIDS patients access to experimental drugs. This system would allowexperimental drugs to be distributed to AIDS patients who do not fitthe criteria demanded for a clinical trial. Young said it couldallow access to drugs several months earlier than a treatment IND,he said.   More than 100 drugs are being investigated for treatment ofacquired immune deficiency syndrome and AIDS-related conditions, hesaid. So far, four have been approved, but only one _ zidovudine, orAZT _ is aimed at stemming the AIDS viral infection itself. Theother three _ ganciclovir, aerosol pentamidine and alpha interferon_ are used to treat AIDS-related conditions.   The FDA said that though studies have shown ganciclovir to beeffective in retarding the sight-threatening infection, extensivepost-marketing studies are needed to determine whether patients onAZT can also take ganciclovir. Both drugs are highly toxic. SyntexCorp. of Palo Alto, Calif., will market ganciclovir under the tradename Cytovene.   R-erythropoietin is one of more than a dozen drugs with treatmentIND status, and the fifth AIDS-related drug to have reached thiscategory. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. of Raritan, N.J., is sponsoringthe drug and will make it available free to patients while thestudies continue.</TEXT></DOC>
