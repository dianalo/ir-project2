Also Sunday, the government approved the establishment of aJewish settlement in the occupied Gaza Strip, Israel radio said.   The United States and European nations oppose new settlements inthe occupied lands, saying they are an obstacle to peace. Theapproval came three days before Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamirvisits Washington. More than 70,000 Israelis live in about 130settlements in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.   In the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza, the body of Ahmed MohammedJamil Shehadeh, 28, was found hanging from a lamppost early Sunday.Arab reporters said he had been kidnapped by four men and wassuspected of collaborating with Israel.   In the West Bank village of Idna, masked Palestinians stabbedand mortally wounded Abdel Hamid Nassar Tmaizi, 40, Arab reportsand hospital officials said. The army confirmed Tmaizi's death andsuggested that criminal motives were behind the slaying, but it didnot elaborate.   On May 19, three armed guerrillas attacked Tmaizi's house, buthe escaped unharmed when a three-vehicle army convoy came to hisrescue. An Israeli army sergeant and all three Arab enforcers werekilled in an ensuing gun battle.   Sunday's deaths brought to 146 the number of Palestinians killedby other Palestinians, most on suspicion of assisting Israeliauthorities in the 23-month-old uprising against Israeli occupationof the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   At least 613 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiersor civilians in the uprising, and 40 Israelis have been killed.   The government approved of a new settlement in the northern GazaStrip, Israel radio said. It is one of eight Jewish settlements thecoalition government agreed would be built by 1992.   Zvi Hender, the head of the Gaza Coast Regional council, toldIsrael radio that foundation work would begin on the settlementthis week and the first 10 families would probably move intotemporary quarters in a few weeks.   Shamir's 11-day visit to the United States begins with a meetingWednesday with President Bush.   Israel is seeking assurances from Washington that proposed talksbetween Israeli and Palestinian delegations will exclude thePalestine Liberation Organization.   Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said the United States ``must find aformula that satisfies us.''   ``I believe if the Americans want to advance peace, and they do,then they will find a solution to this problem,'' he told Israelarmy radio.   Speaking on Israel television Sunday night, Shamir said of theU.S.-Israeli talks: ``There are certain differences of opinion thatcan cause differences during discussions, but I see no reason forconfrontation.''   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the left-leaning Labor Party,which opposes Shamir's hard-line approach, said in a speach thatIsrael should be prepared to take risks for peace.   ``Israel has taken chances in war and in making peace withEgypt, and Israel therefore should take a calculated risk when itcomes to attempts to reach a peace agreement,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
