The rules, which would cost the oil and gas industry anestimated $80 million a year, would require additionaltreatment of discharges from new and existing offshorefacilities. The agency estimates the requirements wouldprevent 14 million pounds of pollutants, including 1.4million pounds of toxic waste, from getting into the oceaneach year.</LP><TEXT>   The agency said the new rules would be especiallybeneficial for shallow areas near shore, where many platformsare located. There are about 13,000 offshore oil and gaswells in U.S. marine waters; the vast majority are in theGulf of Mexico. About 1,000 new wells are drilled every year.   After a public-comment period, the rules are scheduled tobecome final in June 1992. They would be written into permitsissued to new facilities starting in 1992 and into thoseissued to existing facilities by 1995.</TEXT></DOC>
