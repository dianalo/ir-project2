The council, after a four-year study focusing on alternative agricultural approaches, called on Congress to overhaul current federal farm programs.    The report counters the conventional belief that crop rotation and biological pest control are unproductive and unprofitable. It said that such practices, along with reduced pesticide and synthetic-fertilizer use, sometimes even boost crop yields.    Wider adoption of such practices would bring &quot;greater economic benefits to farmers and environmental gains for the nation,&quot; the report said, citing public concern about chemicals in water and foods.    Already, the council said, agriculture causes between $2 billion and $16 billion in damages to the nation's water supply each year.    Chemical companies and industry groups had mixed reactions to the report. Gary Myers, president of the Fertilizer Institute, criticized the academy. &quot;They want to encourage an elitist food policy. It is a real slap at the American consumer and the American farmer.&quot; He said farmers haven't switched to alternative practices because they aren't economically viable and would raise food prices. He said U.S. crop yields are among the highest in the world, and that the country shouldn't tinker with a winning formula.    But James W. Searcy, manager of global product development for Du Pont Agricultural Products, said federal policies discouraging alternative techniques should be changed. Although Du Pont Co. is a large chemical producer, he said the company is preparing to market biological control techniques and genetically engineered crops that better resist disease and pests.    Meanwhile, Charles Hess, assistant agriculture secretary for science and education, said the USDA agrees with the report's recommendations and would support similar proposals for the 1990 congressional farm bill.    Although most farmers don't use alternative agricultural methods, more have recently adopted such techniques to reduce costs, protect their own health and combat pests that are increasingly resistant to chemicals.    More farmers would embrace alternative and environmentally sound farm practices if federal programs were to change, said Richard Harwood, who worked on the NAS report. Commodity price-support programs specifically discourage crop rotation, which allows the use of nitrogen-fixing plants as a substitute for synthetic fertilizers. Crop rotation also helps control soil erosion, which is occurring at a rate of three billion tons a year.    The report also recommends overhauling federal grading standards for produce that impose &quot;cosmetic&quot; criteria that are difficult for farmers to meet with alternative methods, but have nothing to do with the food's nutritional quality. Oranges with slight mite damage on the skin, for example, get lower gradings and thus fetch reduced prices, even if they are to be used for juice, Mr. Harwood said. The government, he added, must launch educational efforts so that consumers won't shun cosmetically damaged products. And, it must pump $40 million into research on alternative agricultural practices, which until recently the government and U.S. universities have largely ignored, the report said. </TEXT></DOC>
