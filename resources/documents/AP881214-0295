On other markets, prices of copper, precious metals, energy andmost agricultural futures also rose while stock-index futuresretreated.   Coffee's day-long rally was ``an explosion'' featuring extremelyheavy volume, said Bert Ruiz, a coffee broker with Balfour MaclaineCorp. in New York.   Coffee settled 2.30 cents to 4.64 cents higher with the spotDecember contract at $1.35 a pound and the heavily traded Marchcontract at $1.3342 a pound, the highest settlement price for eithercontract since July 25.   Analysts said the Brazilian dockworkers' strike, which beganTuesday and halted shipments from the key coffee port of Santos, wasnot expected to last long.   But the strike focused the market's attention on dwindlingwarehouse stocks of coffee just as consumption approaches its annualpeak, and on the steadily deteriorating crop-production outlook inBrazil due to a drought in that country's major coffee-growingregions.   Ruiz said supplies that ordinarily arrive in the United Statesfrom Central America at this time of year have been delayed by heavyrains. And another 1 million bags of coffee recently authorized forrelease onto the market by the International Coffee Organization'sprice-support formula has not yet occurred, he said.   Since June, Brazil's coffee-growing regions have received normalmonthly precipitation in only one month _ October, said KimBadenhop, an analyst wiht Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. For theyear to date, precipitation in most of those areas is less than 50percent of normal, he said.   The dry weather has lessened the quality of the 1988-89 Braziliancrop now being harvested and reduced projections for the 1989-90crop from original estimates of more than 40 million bags to about25 million bags.   Copper futures rallied strongly on New York's Commodity Exchangein technically inspired buying following two days of steep declines,said Peter Cardillo, commodities trading adviser with Josephthal andamp;Co. in New York.   Copper settled 2.20 cents to 4.20 cents higher with March at$1.332 a pound.   Platinum soared in a technical rebound from its recent lows whilegold and silver finished modestly higher, mainly in reaction toplatinum's gains and to strength in the energy market, Cardillo said.   Platinum settled $9.50 to $14.50 higher on the New YorkMercantile Exchange with January at $604.50 a troy ounce. On theCommodity Exchange, gold was $1.60 to $1.80 higher with February at$425.70 a troy ounce; silver was 0.9 cent to 1.4 cents higher withMarch at $6.305 a troy ounce.
