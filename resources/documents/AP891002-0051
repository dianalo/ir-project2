Three former members of the pro-democracy movement led about3,500 demonstrators Sunday to protest the 40th anniversary ofcommunist rule in their homeland.   The marchers walked in a downpour from the Lincoln Memorial tothe Chinese Embassy here to protest the violent crackdown on thestudent democracy movement in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Nearly2,000 other marchers demonstrated in Los Angeles and San Francisco,and hundreds marched in Canada.   ``The Chinese government must stop killing,'' said Shen Tong,one of the three pro-democracy leaders, who fled China after thecrackdown last summer. ``We appeal to peace-loving people all overthe world to stand together with us and fight for a China in whichbasic freedoms are guaranteed.''   Another of the three emigres, Wu'er Kaxi, told a small newsconference outside the Chinese Embassy that ``the attitude of theAmerican people as well as that of Congress has been clear sincethe events'' of the crackdown. Asked whether he had any specificcriticisms or demands of the Bush administration, he replied, ``Nocomment.''   Shen, Wu'er and the third leader, LiuYan, were in Washington fora fast and protest. Police estimated the crowd of marchers at 3,500.   In San Francisco, 1,200 people shouted and waved signs outsidethe Chinese consulate in a noisy but peaceful protest againstNational Day, the celebration of the 40th anniversary of thePeople's Republic of China.   Protesters during the three-hour demonstration said four decadesof communism had been a failure for China and blasted the Chinesegovernment's repression of the pro-democracy movement.   Many of the signs pledged to remember the ``martyrs'' ofdemocracy, hundreds of students who were killed when troops firedon Beijing's Tiananmen Square last June.   Police reported no arrests or problems because of the protests.   In Los Angeles, some 700 people gathered peacefully outside theChinese consulate downtown waving human rights signs, singing peacesongs and cheering speeches by university students, Christianclergyman and community leaders.   The crowd, mainly Chinese natives, formed a semicircle on thestreet in front of a military tank, two tents, a 5-foot Goddess ofLiberty statue and a gray coffin, on which dozens of spectatorsplaced white flowers.   The Joint Committee of Chinese Students and Scholars sponsoredthe two-hour protest which included a re-enactment of the studentmassacre and a mock trial.   Ting Huang, a computer engineer and native Chinese, donned aT-shirt with a picture of Deng Xiaoping, the 85-year-old seniorleader in China. The words above the photo stated ``Wanted forMurder.''   ``I'm here to protest continuing human rights violations inChina, secret arrests and imprisonment,'' Huang said.   On Oct. 1, 1949, Mao Zedong declared the founding of thePeople's Republic of China.   About 500 people demonstrated in front of the Chinese embassy inOttawa, while 300 rallied in Toronto.   ``We are going to use every occasion to help people rememberJune 4 and tell the world we will never forget, nor will we stopfighting for democracy,'' said Dennis Lu, president of the CanadianFederation of Chinese Students and Scholars in Toronto.   Several protesters wore brown paper bags on their heads, fearingfor the safety of relatives still in China.</TEXT></DOC>
