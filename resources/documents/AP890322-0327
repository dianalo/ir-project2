The unionized rail workers wanted the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals to allow them to strike in sympathy with Eastern workers.But the appeals court refused to lift a lower court's bar on suchstrikes.   However, the appeals court agreed to hold a hearing early nextweek on the union's arguments for it to overturn the lower courtorder barring sympathy walkouts at the Long Island Rail Road,Metro-North Commuter Railroad, N.J. Transit and Amtrak.   On Monday, U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson Jr. barredunionized workers at the four lines from honoring the picket linesof striking Eastern machinists. The injunction did not barpicketing, merely any organized walkout in sympathy with thepicketers.   Prior to the appeals court ruling, union lawyer Richard Ruda toldthe three-judge panel there could be no distinction between settingup picket lines and honoring them. ``Union members don't crosspicket lines,'' he said, adding that respecting the power of apicket line is ``virtually a matter of religion to unionists.''   ``There simply is a fundamental right to honor picket lines,''Ruda said.   But Bernard Plum, a lawyer for Metro-North and the LIRR, arguedthat Patterson's injunction only kept union leaders from orderingtheir members not to cross picket lines.   Patterson sought ``to eliminate the sense of compulsion (to honorpicket lines) that had been spread by the unions,'' said Plum.   Amtrak lawyer Sally Garr added that sympathy strikes ``woulddisrupt all of the commuter traffic in the Northeast.'' She said theharm the unions would endure if their right to sympathy strikes werelimited was less than ``the irreparable harm'' to almost 500,000daily Amtrak riders.   ``Certainly the public should not be held hostage to this labordispute,'' she said.   In rebuttal, Ruda, the union lawyer, said earlier courtdecisions, including one by the U.S. Supreme Court, have found thatthe threat of a railroad shutdown is not enough to abridge unionrights.   He maintained that any commuter chaos caused by railroad workers'sympathy strikes might pressure President Bush to intervene in theEastern strike, which began March 4.   ``The pressure in this instance is directed at the president,''said Ruda. Bush, he noted, is empowered to create a task force toimpose a 60-day cooling off period and make recommendations tosettle the Eastern strike.</TEXT></DOC>
