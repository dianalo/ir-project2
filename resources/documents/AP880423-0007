Col. Oliver L. North and threeco-defendants.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and two top deputies andAttorney Edwin Meese III and two of his top aides are among thelist of 105 witnesses submitted in a court filing Friday byindependent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.   The list includes national security officials knowledgeableabout the covert sale of U.S. arms to Iran, private operatives whoran the secret supply network that armed the Nicaraguan rebels,Contra leaders and wealthy donors who contributed to their cause.   No date has been set for the trial of North, former nationalsecurity adviser John M. Poindexter and two arms dealers: retiredAir Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim.   They are accused of conspiring to divert profits illegally fromthe U.S.-Iran arms sales to help the Contras during a ban on directAmerican military aid to the rebels.   Walsh filed the witness list in advance of Monday's hearingcalled by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to determine ifprosecutors impermissibly relied on evidence derived from thecompelled congressional testimony of North, Hakim and Poindexter.   Most of the witnesses were known to Walsh before Hakim receivedcongressional immunity on April 20, 1987.   The list includes deputy CIA director Robert Gates, former WhiteHouse chief of staff Donald Regan, former national security adviserRobert McFarlane and assistant attorneys general William BradfordReynolds and Charles Cooper.   Meese, Cooper, and Reynolds would be expected to testify aboutthe November 1986 investigation they conducted that uncovered thediversion of arms-sale profits.   The defense, meanwhile, indicated that it will call Reynolds asa witness during the hearing on the immunity question. The defensewants to show that statements he made to the grand jury wereinfluenced by the defendants' compelled congressional testimony,according to court papers.   Late Friday, Gesell issued an order blocking a defense attemptto subpoena nine members of Walsh's staff to testify at the hearing.   Seven of the prospective trial witnesses are referred to only bynumber ``because of national security concerns,'' Walsh said. Theiridentities were given privately to the court and the defense.   Other top officials on the list include Assistant Secretary ofState Elliott Abrams, State Department legal adviser Abraham Sofaerand former CIA general counsel Stanley Sporkin, now a federal judgehere.   McFarlane, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges ofwithholding information from Congress about covert aid to theContras, is one of several former National Security Councilofficials on the list, which includes North's former secretary FawnHall.   Contra leaders Adolfo Calero and Luis Alfonse Robelo are listedalong with retired Army Maj. Gen. John Singlaub, who helped raiseprivate money for the anti-Sandinista cause.   Donors Ellen Garwood, William O'Boyle, and C. Thomas Claggett,Jr. are listed along with William Haskell, who owned land inCentral America where an airstrip was built for resupply operations.   Also on the list were two conservative fund-raisers, Carl R.``Spitz'' Channell and Richard Miller. Channell and Miller pleadedguilty last year to conspiring illegally to use a tax-exemptfoundation to help raise Contra money.   The defense indicated it also wanted to call Secord and formerNational Security Council aide Kenneth deGraffenreid as witnessesat next week's hearing.   Walsh's office moved to disqualify the defense from calling anywitnesses on the ground that the lawyers did not meet Thursday'sdeadline for notifying the prosecution of the grand jury witnessthey intended to produce at the hearing.   The prosecutor also argued that deGraffenreid and Secord weren'tgrand jury witnesses and therefore couldn't testify at next week'shearing.   The defense apparently wants to put Secord on the witness standto show that testimony he gave to Congress, without immunity, wasbased on information he received from Hakim, who gave closed-doortestimony to the congressional committees before the publichearings began last spring.</TEXT></DOC>
