Any conflicts within the military over the handling of studentunrest are unlikely to flare into major confrontations among armyunits, they say.   ``The army has always opted for unity. The instinct of mostChinese soldiers is to unite behind bad policy instead of breakingup,'' said Harvey Jencks, a research associate at the University ofCalifornia at Berkeley and an expert on the Chinese military.   Economic reforms have increased inflation in China, eroding thevalue of military wages and making the army sympathetic to hard-linepolicies, many experts said.   ``The military leadership has more to gain from a conservativeeconomic policy because their wages are hurting from inflation,''said June Teufel Dreyer, an expert on the People's Liberation Armywho teaches political science at the University of Miami.   ``These kids in the army are there grudgingly and are notsophisticated. They will protect themselves first,'' she said.   The Chinese experts also said many army officers have theircareers tied to the Communist Party and the privileges of rank, andare unlikely to rebel.   ``The officer corps of the PLA is made up almost exclusively ofChinese Communist Party members,'' said Jurgen Domes, a West Germanprofessor who is a visiting scholar at the Center for ChineseStudies at Berkeley.   ``A sizeable majority are second-generation military, members ofa privileged class whose privilege is bound to their position in themilitary.''   Domes said these second-generation officers have fewer options _and, therefore, a higher stake in the status quo _ than studentdissidents who are sons and daughters of party cadres.   The intellectuals have had the opportunity to go abroad or seek avariety of posts in the civilian sector, Domes said.   Even those who see support in the army for the student movementdon't see it leading to open conflict in the ranks.   ``Some middle-rank officers have been infected with the virus ofdemocracy, but the life of the Chinese soldier has not been ared-hot one under the economic reforms,'' said Harvey Nelsen, aprofessor at the University of South Florida. ``The average soldieris an ill-educated peasant with little understanding of the issues.''   Domes agreed, saying that 40 percent of the army's rank-and-fileare ``illiterate peasants with no understanding or even awareness''of the principles for which pro-democracy activists are striving.   Unlike others, Jencks saw widespread army support for the studentprotesters, but he predicted the desire for unity would prevail.   ``Probably, a majority of the army sympathizes with the students,but they won't shoot each other over it,'' he said.   Nelsen was the only academician interviewed by The AssociatedPress who saw substantial political divisions between the 27th Armyand other army units. The 27th Army is believed to have carried outthe brunt of attacks against demonstrators in Beijing since June 3.   Nelsen, who traveled to China last month and has written a bookon the Chinese military, said the divisions were unlikely to lead toserious fighting but could help reformers win the battle within thecountry's leadership.   ``If the 27th remains isolated, they are likely to do a lot ofposturing and intimidation, but finally they will surrender, and thereformers will win,'' he said.   Domes said he agreed with U.S.-based Chinese student leader PeiMinxin, who said in a television interview Wednesday that rumors ofmilitary infighting and imminent civil war were a ruse by theChinese leadership.   Domes speculated that troops had been moved in and out of Beijingto create an illusion of dissension and frighten foreigners intofleeing. Then, Domes predicted, few would remain to witness thearrest or execution of many more dissidents.   He said at least 15 million to 18 million Chinese have beenkilled for political reasons since the Communists took power in 1949.   ``The only difference this time is that it was captured bytelevision cameras,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
