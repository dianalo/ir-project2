The film, starring Richard Dreyfuss, reinterprets Shakespeare's``Hamlet'' from the point of view of the prince's two old schoolchums, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who become unwittinglyinvolved in, and ultimately victims of, the power play betweenHamlet and his stepfather.   A screen treatment of Stoppard's 1966 hit tragi-comic play bythe same name, the film was not generally expected to take theGolden Lion prize despite the favorable reviews it received afterits screening.   The favorite had been Martin Scorcese's ``Goodfellas,'' whichinstead won the second place Silver Lion Award for direction. Thefilm provides a vividly realistic portrait of life in the Americanunderworld, with Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro in a supportingrole.   The award for Best Actress went to Gloria Munchmeyer for herstarring role in Chilean director Silvio Caiozzi's film ``La LunaEn El Espejo'' (The Moon in the Mirror).   The Best Actor award went to Oleg Borisov, protagonist of``Edinstvenijat Svidetel,'' (The Only Witness) by Bulgariandirector Michail Pandurski.   New Zealand director Jane Campion's entry, ``An Angel at MyTable,'' won the jury's ``special grand prize,'' and received along standing ovation from an appreciative crowd at the awardsceremony.   A nine-person jury headed by American author Gore Vidal judgedthe 21 films from 18 countries running in the competition at thisyear's 47th edition of the festival.   Meanwhile, some critics at the festival have blasted ``Henry andJune,'' a controversial American movie about Henry Miller that hasearned an ``X'' rating for its erotic scenes.   But many critics at the festival, which ends today, also havesigned a petition urging the repeal of the ``X'' rating on groundsthat it limits artistic freedom.   Set in the literary scene in Paris in the 1930s, the film isbased on sections of the diaries of Anais Nin and theautobiographical novels of Miller, an American expatriate. BothMiller and Nin were entranced with the young June Smith.   ``It was just a bad film,'' commented Irene Bignardi, critic ofRome's La Repubblica, after the world premiere Friday. ``But evenAmericans who are rather infantile would not be shocked by it.''   ``It's enough to put you off sex,'' quipped The Guardian'scritic, Derek Malcolm.   The film stars Swedish-American Uma Thurman, whose first breakcame as a seduced adolescent in Stephen Frears' ``DangerousLiaisons.'' It was directed by Philip Kaufman, whose other moviesinclude ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' and ``The RightStuff.''   Produced by Universal Pictures, the film was rated ``X'' lastmonth by the U.S. Motion Picture Association's rating board,meaning no one under 17 can be admitted for viewing.   Universal has vowed to appeal the rating in an attempt tochallenge the 22-year-old rating system.</TEXT></DOC>
