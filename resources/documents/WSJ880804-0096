The forecast comes after 5% growth last year and 4% in 1986, and against an improving world economy. &quot;The most striking feature of the world economy in the past 12 months has been its unexpected resiliency,&quot; a GATT report said.    GATT's economists said in the report that the positive elements of the world economy outweigh the negative factors. In particular, large adjustments in prices between 1985 and 1987 &quot;now seem to be giving way to the trade-stimulating effects,&quot; the report said.    The economists also pointed to relatively stable currency rates, to declines in merchandise-trade imbalances of the U.S. and Japan, and to &quot;modest progress&quot; in the developing world's indebtedness.    The report said the world economy is expected to grow 3% this year and next, after expanding 3% in 1987 and 1986.    But GATT tempered its generally optimistic report by citing many problems, such as inflation, unemployment, Third World debt, current-account imbalances among Japan, West Germany and the U.S., and protectionist pressures.    The report also traced a mixed effect on trade from the three-year fall of the dollar. U.S. export volume is up, while Japan's export volume has stagnated as domestic demand increased Japan's imports. But U.S. imports still remain strong on relentless domestic demand, while West Germany's sluggish domestic demand led to reduced growth in import volume, despite the higher mark. </TEXT></DOC>
