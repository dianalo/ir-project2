The Commission has analyzed the record developedduring that proceeding and has concluded that Sun has not shown that itsfiber is sufficiently different from nylon to justify the creation of anew definition and name to describe it. The Commission announces, therefore,that Textile Rule 7 will not be amended.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 53 FR 45913.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>May 31, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>James Mills, Attorney (202/326-3035),Division of Enforcement, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Federal Trade Commission,Washington, DC 20580.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Section A. Background</ITAG>Rule 6, 16 CFR 303.6, of the Rules and Regulations under the Textile FiberProducts Identification Act requires manufacturers to use the generic namesof the fibers contained in their textile fiber products in making requireddisclosures of the fiber content of the products. Rule 7, 16 CFR 303.7,sets forth the generic names and definitions that the Commission has establishedfor synthetic fibers. Rule 8, 16 CFR 303.8, contains the procedures forestablishing new generic names.On February 3, 1988, Sun's subsidiary, the Sun Refining and Marketing Company,requested that the Commission establish a new generic name and definitionfor a fiber it manufactures. Sun's application describes its fiber as apolyetheramide that it has identified by the trademark ``VIVRELLE.'' Sunnotes that its fiber is now commercially available from Snia Fibre, anItalian Company with which Sun jointly developed VIVRELLE, and that itwill soon become available in this country, first as an import and, later,as a domestically manufactured product. The application and related materialswere placed on the rulemaking record.Sun has been designating VIVRELLE as ``nylon.'' Sun contends, however,that its fiber is substantially different from nylon, both chemically andin terms of its physical performance. Sun's fiber is fully described inSun's application and in the November 15 Notice.Sun contends that VIVRELLE, which it describes as a block copolymer ofa conventional nylon with a polyetheramide, is a synthetic ``comfort''fiber. It views VIVRELLE as a unique combination of three important comfort-relatedcharacteristics: softness, moisture absorption and moisture transport and,therefore, as an ideal candidate for consumer apparel such as sweatsuits,undergarments, etc. Sun presents considerable data that show that the polyetheramidesare superior to conventional nylons in the factors relevant to comfort.Sun submits that the differences are substantial enough that the polyetheramidesshould not have to be classified with conventional nylons.Sun proposes a new generic fiber classification and definition for itsfiber and a corresponding change to the existing definition of nylon soconsumers will not mistakenly associate VIVRELLE with nylon and nylon'sproperties. Sun recommends the name ``OXAMID'' for its fiber.After an initial analysis of Sun's application, the Commission, on June14, 1988, granted Sun the designation ``SU 0001'' for temporary use indescribing the fiber pending final disposition of the application.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section B. Analysis of Comments and Final Action</ITAG>The November 15 Notice solicited comment on the application generally aswell as specifically on whether the application met the following threecriteria, which the Commission has identified as grounds for granting petitionsfor new generic names, and which the Commission has applied to Sun's application:\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The criteria appear at 38 FR 34112, 34114 (Dec. 11, 1973).1. The fiber for which a generic name is requested must have a chemicalcomposition radically different from other fibers, and that distinctivechemical composition must result in distinctive physical properties ofsignificance to the general public.2. The fiber must be in active commercial use or such use must be immediatelyforeseen.3. The granting of the generic name must be of importance to the consumingpublic at large, rather than to a small group of knowledgeable professionalssuch as purchasing officers for large Government agencies.In addition to Sun's application, the record includes a supplemental filingfrom Sun responding to specific questions, posed by staff, relating tothe application. This filing was placed on the rulemaking record at thebeginning of the comment period.\3\<NOTE/> The record also includes a comment from the E. I. du Pontde Nemours andamp; Company (``Du Pont'').\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ 206-24-3. The comments in this proceeding have been placedon the public record under the numerical designation 206-24. Sun's applicationis numbered 206-24-1, the November 15 Notice is 206-24-2, Sun's supplementalanswers are 206-24-3, and Du Pont's comment (and technical attachments)is numbered 206-24-4. References to these documents will be made by usingthese numerical designations and a page reference.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Du Pont believes that Sun has not demonstrated that VIVRELLEis chemically and physically different enough to justify describing itas anything other than nylon. Du Pont points out that there are severalfibers in current production, classified as ``nylon,'' that exhibit propertiessimilar to those Sun attributes to VIVRELLE, such as Du Pont's Supplexand Antron nylon 6,6 fibers, Imperial Chemical Industries' Tactel nylon-6,6fiber and Allied Chemical's Hydrofil nylon-6 fiber. Du Pont also believesthat ``the granting of a new generic name and definition for aliphaticpolyetheramide block copolymers could lead to a proliferation of applicationsfor new generics based on fiber compositions that are only marginally differentin chemical structure from the current definition of nylon and exhibitproperty differences which are largely imperceptible to the consuming public.''ChemicalCompositionAfter a thorough analysis of the record, the Commission finds that VIVRELLEcannot accurately be described as ``radically different'' in chemical structurefrom nylon. In Rule 7 of the Textile Rules, nylon is defined as a manufacturedfiber in which the fiber-forming substance is a long-chain synthetic polyamidein which less than 85% of the amide-linkages are directly attached to twoaromatic rings.\5\<NOTE/> According to Sun's application, VIVRELLE is a block copolymerof conventional nylon (for example, nylon-6, or nylon-6,6) with a polyetheramide.By Sun's estimation, ``* * * at least 15% of the amide linkages in theblock copolymer are attached to aliphatic ether units. In general, themaximum amount is 40%.'' \6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ 16 CFR 303.7(i).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ 206-24-1, 3-4.A reading of Sun's application suggests, however, that Sun appears to beproducing a mixed, block copolymer with 15% polyetheramide in the fiber.The application does not convincingly demonstrate that Sun will be producinga fiber in which significantly greater than 15% by weight of the conventionalnylon amide units or linkages have been replaced or substituted. In itssupplemental filing, Sun suggests that the amide interchange reaction inits copolymer is indeed apparent from indirect physical evidence, suchas melting point/differential scanning calorimetry data.\7\<NOTE/> But weight fractions of the individual constituents suggestthat, at 15% claimed amide interchange, it remains uncertain that morethan 15% of the amide linkages are attached directly to aliphatic etherunits. Restated, it is unclear that 15% or more of the amide linkages havebeen substituted. Consequently, VIVRELLE has not been shown to have a chemicalcomposition radically different from nylon.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ 206-24-3, 1. See also Attachments 1-3, especially theReport by R. M. Thompson.The current definition of nylon includes a broad range of long-chain polyamide-basedfibers, which permits an equally broad range of chemical structure andphysical properties to be included under the definition. All of these fibersare generically nylon.\8\<NOTE/> The Commission finds that the current definition is appropriateto describe VIVRELLE chemically.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ There is one exception_aramid_which has been demonstratedto have a radically different chemical structure, and for which a new genericdefinition was, therefore, granted. 38 FR 34112 (Dec. 11, 1973).PhysicalPropertiesIn addition to finding that VIVRELLE's chemical composition is not ``radicallydifferent'' from that of nylon, the Commission finds that VIVRELLE doesnot possess ``distinctive physical properties of significance to the generalpublic.'' While Sun has shown that VIVRELLE has desirable physical characteristicsthat could make the fiber useful to the general public, it has not demonstratedthat these are linked to a radical chemical difference from nylon (discussedimmediately above), nor has it shown that the physical characteristicsare ``distinctive.'' Indeed, as Du Pont notes in its comments for the publicrecord and by means of the two patents attached to its comment, there areseveral nylons in production that have similar physical characteristics.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ 206-24-4, 3. See footnote 4, above.In summary, Sun's application does not demonstrate that its new fiber hasa chemical composition that is radically different from nylon, nor doesit demonstrate that the fiber possesses distinctive physical propertiesthat result from a chemical difference. Consequently, the Commission deniesSun's application on the basis that Sun has not met the first of the publishedcriteria mentioned earlier_it must be radically different chemically andhave distinctive physical properties.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section C.
