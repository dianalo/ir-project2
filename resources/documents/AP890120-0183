North, urgingconservative students to stay involved in politics, called GeorgeBush's inauguration as president Friday the celebration of a ``greatvictory.''   The former White House aide refused to comment on Ronald Reagan'sdecision not to pardon North and fellow defendant John M. Poindexterbefore leaving office.   Asked if he would comment on the pardon situation, North saidbluntly ``No'' before driving away from a hotel in nearby Rosslyn,Va., where he appeared at a support rally staged by a conservativegroup, Students for America.   In an interview Thursday, Reagan said he still believes North andPoindexter will be found innocent of criminal wrongdoing inconnection with the Iran-Contra affair, which involved diversion tothe Nicaraguan rebels of profits from secret arms sales to Iran.   Reagan also said that granting pardons for either man would haveleft them ``forever after with that guilt hanging over them.''   North was greeted by cheers and chanting of ``Ollie! Ollie!''when he appeared before the student audience, which displayed abanner declaring ``Oliver North, American Hero.''   ``My exhortation to you, my encouragement to you is to stayinvolved in the political process that we've commemorated in thiscity today,'' he told the convention.   He called the inauguration ``the celebration of this greatvictory, the celebration of this peaceful transition from oneexecutive to another.''   ``The mandate is clear,'' North said. ``In the election of GeorgeBush to the presidency of the United States, the American peoplesaid, `we believe in the free enterprise system, we believe in thesupport for freedom around the world.' And it's now important thatyou communicate that very sense to the elected members of Congress,who have in many cases opposed those ideas.''   The former National Security Council aide is scheduled to standtrial here Jan. 31 on 12 felony charges, including allegations helied to various inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair and illegallyused a tax-exempt foundation to help raise money for the Nicaraguanrebels.</TEXT></DOC>
