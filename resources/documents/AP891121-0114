The increase in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index,which translated into an annual inflation rate of 5.9 percent,followed four months in which the index recorded tiny gains of 0.2percent or less.   October's inflation spurt was blamed on a statistical jump ingasoline costs, hefty increases in dairy products and fruit andrising costs for new cars and clothing.   Economists for the most part discounted the increase, saying itdid not shake their belief that price pressures will remainmoderate in coming months.   ``This is the first month in five that inflation has been in theproblem range and most likely it will not persist,'' said AllenSinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.   Inflation raced upward in the first five months of the year,only to moderate through the summer as energy prices retreated.   Through the first 10 months of the year, consumer prices havebeen rising at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, up only slightly fromthe 4.4 percent price gains recorded in both 1987 and 1988.   David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, predicted thatthe increase in consumer prices for the entire year will hold at4.6 percent and will improve to 4.2 percent next year.   ``The October increase was just a make-up for some unusuallygood numbers in the last few months,'' he said. ``With the slowdownin the economy, we think we will get another year of stability inprices.''   The Bush administration was also sanguine about October's priceincrease with presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater noting thatin the past six months, the CPI has risen at an annual rate of just3.3 percent.   ``This is lower than for any six-month period since December1986, and lower than the average inflation of 3.6 percent over thelast seven years. So inflation holds relatively steady but at a lowlevel,'' Fitzwater said.   Gasoline costs climbed a seasonally adjusted 0.9 percent inOctober, the biggest jump since last May. Gasoline prices have beenon a roller-coaster ride this year, soaring by 21.2 percent in thefirst five months and then falling by 9.3 percent from June throughSeptember.   Pump prices actually were unchanged in October, but theynormally fall at the end of the summer driving season. Thus, thefrozen price level translated into an increase after the LaborDepartment made adjustments to take into account normal seasonalpricing variations.   Food costs were up 0.4 percent, the biggest advance since a 0.6percent May increase. Dairy products posted a huge gain for thesecond straight month, rising by 1.8 percent, the biggest increasein more than nine years. Fruit and vegetable prices jumped 1.2percent, led by big gains in the cost of apples and bananas.   Consumer prices minus food and energy costs, the inflationmeasure considered to be a good guage of underlying pricepressures, rose 0.5 percent in October, matching the increase inthe overall index.   New car prices, reflecting the introduction of 1990 models andhigher financing costs, rose 0.6 percent after having fallen forfive consecurtive months. Used car prices, however, continued todecline, edging down 0.1 percent.   Clothing costs, which took a big 1.7 percent rise in September,rose another 1 percent in October, reflecting higher costs for thefall and winter lines.   Home heating oil costs were up a sharp 2.5 percent while naturalgas and electricity prices rose a more modest 0.3 percent.   Medical costs, which rose 0.7 percent in October, are 8.1percent higher than a year ago, the biggest increase of any of themajor price categories.   The Federal Reserve, which began the year fighting inflation bypushing interest rates higher, has been lowering rates in recentmonths because of concerns over widespread economic weakness.   Many analysts predicted that the October blip in consumer priceswould not deter the Fed from making further credit easing moves inthe months ahead.   ``The Fed doesn't like to see the inflation rates this high butthe economy is very weak right now and that is their overridingconcern,'' said Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch.   Before taking into account normal seasonal variations, theConsumer Price Index stood at 125.6 in October, meaning that ahypothetical selection of goods and services costing $100 in the1982-84 base period would have cost $125.60 last month, up from$120.20 a year ago.   In a separate report Tuesday, the Labor Department said thatAmericans' average weekly earnings rose to $343.07 in October, 4percent higher than a year ago, but not enough to keep up withinflation during this time period.</TEXT></DOC>
