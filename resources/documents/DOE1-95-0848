<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-95-0848 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new design concept for fissile material production breeder is proposed.The key technologies are (1) a shaped-projectile, which has a built-inimploding mechanism with a DT fuel-pellet eliminating a fuel target injectionin fine alignment, (2) an axially symmetric mass driver, which is basedon a rapid Z-pinch discharge between the cylindrical electrodes expectingpositionally stable acceleration of the projectile, and (3) a molten-salttarget/blanklet technology, which is similar tot hat of Accelerator Molten-SaltBreeder having a big salt bath with deep voltex but now adding He bubbles.The target salt including /sup 233/U prepared in IFMSB could be suppliedto the Molten-Salt Fission Power Stations, integrally constituting anidealistic molten salt fuel cycle system.</TEXT></DOC>
