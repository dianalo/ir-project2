<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-26-1083 </DOCNO><TEXT>Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the head was performed in 100patients for mostly neurological indications, less frequently pathologicalprocesses in the region of the external carotid artery. The intravenousor intraarterial route was selected according to the condition and ageof the patient and clinical diagnosis. In 55% of cases the contrast mediumwas administered into the ascending aorta, in 13% selectively into thecarotid or vertebral arteries. The examination was performed intravenouslyin 32%, most frequently via inferior vena cava (26%). The visualizationof the whole area of the carotid and vertebral arteries from the ramificationof the aortal arc up to the periphery requires to make at least 4 to5 administrations of contrast medium, since simultaneous representationof lateral and AP projection for DSA has not been so far possible andthe screen size is small. In intravenous DSA the amount of contrast mediumincreases up to 200 ml. Instillation into the ascending artery is thereforepreferred and half of the amount is thus sufficient. DSA has proved ofadvantage in the examination of patients with arteriosclerosis, angiomasand arteriovenous malformations, vascularized and avascular expansiveprocesses in intracranial and extracranial localizations. Quality angiogramswere obtained in 84%, those still suitable for evaluation in 14% anduseless in 2% of cases. (author). 14 figs., 1 tab., 16 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
