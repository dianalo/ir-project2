The state ofthe art of the turbulent developments in superconductivity is discussed.Some applications are mentioned: generators (helium-cooling and nitrogen-cooling);magnets in fusion research and particle accelerators; high gradient magneticseparation in waste water purification plants; microelectronics. Investmentsin superconductors research in the Netherlands are compared to investmentsin Japan, USA, Western Germany and Great Britain. All this is commentedby Dr. C.A.M. van der Klein, Head Program Bureau of the Netherlands EnergyResearch Foundation (ECN). 9 figs., 7 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
