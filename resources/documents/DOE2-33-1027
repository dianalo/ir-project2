The viscous torque isgenerally non-zero at both the last stable orbit and the horizon itself.The existence of a non-zero viscous torque at the horizon does not requirethe transfer of energy or angular momentum across any spacelike distance,and so does not violate causality. Further, in comparison with the viscoustorque in the distant, Newtonian regime, the viscous torque on the horizonis often reversed, so that angular momentum is viscously advected inwardsrather than outwards. This phenomenon is first suggested by an analysisof the quasi-stationary case, and then demonstrated explicitly for aseries of cold, dynamical flows which fall freely from the last stableorbit in the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics. In the steady flows constructedhere, the net torque on the hole is always directed in the usual sense;any reversal in the viscous torque is offset by an increase in the convectedflux of angular momentum.</TEXT></DOC>
