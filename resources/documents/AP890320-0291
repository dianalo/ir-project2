The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 48.57 pointsFriday, dropped 23.21 to 2,268.93 by noontime on Wall Street.   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 3 to 1 in the overall tallyof New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 338 up, 972 down and479 unchanged.   Friday's news that the producer price index of finished goodsrose a full percentage point in February for the second consecutivemonth caught many traders by surprise.   Interest rates jumped as investors quickly concluded that theFederal Reserve was likely to tighten credit further in its effortsto keep inflation in check. Rates were mostly higher again today inthe credit markets.   More evidence of trouble is expected on Tuesday when the LaborDepartment reports on the consumer price index for last month.   Fears have increased on the Street that the Fed might wind uppushing the economy to the brink of a recession before it sees anysigns that its anti-inflation campaign is working.   International Business Machines led the active list, down 3[ at109] on top of a 5|-point drop Friday, when the company said itsfirst-quarter earnings would fall short of analysts' estimates.   Other losers among the blue chips included Ford Motor, down | at4ng Sunday to get the craft ready for itsride atop a jumbo jet to Florida. Officials, however, expected it toleave on time Friday.   After their desert landing at Edwards early Saturday, the fiveastronauts spent the rest of the weekend with their families.   They were going back to work today, briefing the space agency onthe shuttle's performance and the experiments conducted during thenearly flawless five-day mission, said Steve Nesbitt, a JohnsonSpace Center spokesman.   A preliminary examination indicated only 10 thermal protectiontiles will need to be replaced, in contrast to the last shuttleflight, in December, when nearly 200 tiles were severely damaged.   ``This is one of the best yet,'' said Cindy Lodge, who works onthe shuttle's tile system. ``We've had no major damages, there's afew dings ... around the nose cap, nothing severe at all.''   The tiles shield orbiters during the fiery re-entry into Earth'satmosphere.   Five tiles were damaged when wires connected to a tire pressuremonitor snapped as the right main landing gear dropped, Ms. Lodgesaid. Only one of those five tiles will need to be replaced, shesaid.   The brakes, which have caused problems during previous shuttlelandings, also performed well, engineers said.   ``The brakes looked the best ever. No signs of any heat; therewas no damage whatsoever,'' said NASA's Tip Talone, who coordinatesprocessing of the orbiter for each flight.   The mission ended with a picture-perfect landing that was watchedby a near-record crowd of 460,000.   Five hundred people cheered the astronauts' return to Houstonlater in the afternoon.   ``We've had one fun time and we really enjoyed this flight,''said mission specialist James F. Buchli, who had been on twoprevious Discovery missions.   The flight was commanded by Michael L. Coats, who had flown oneprevious shuttle mission. The other crew members _ pilot John E.Blaha and mission specialists Robert C. Springer and James P. Bagian_ made their first voyages.   Discovery's flight, the 28th shuttle mission, was the third sinceChallenger exploded shortly after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986. Sevenastronauts died in the explosion, which brought shuttle flights to ahalt for nearly three years.   Discovery blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., a week agotoday. Six hours into the mission, the crew accomplished its primarymission _ the deployment of a $100 million communications satellite.   The satellite completes a network that will enable the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration to have nearly constant contactwith space shuttles and other satellites.   The astronauts also photographed the Earth. Their film will beedited into a movie that will document environmental damage by manand nature.   Four rats that were aboard as one of the experiments, were killedshortly after touchdown so researchers can study how theirintentionally cut legs healed in microgravity. Many of the 32fertilized chicken eggs that were aboard will be allowed to hatch tosee how space affected embryo development.   Other experiments included growing protein crystals as part of aproject to develop new drugs and seeing how plants grow inmicrogravity. The results will be studied by the researchers whodesigned the experiments.   The only problem during the flight concerned an erratic pressurereading from a hydrogen tank that helps supply electricity to theorbiter. The astronauts conserved electricity for a day until groundcontrollers corrected the difficulty.   The next shuttle to fly _ Atlantis _ is expected to be rolled outto a Cape Canaveral launch pad Wednesday for its scheduled April 28liftoff. The Atlantis astronauts will deploy a probe that will mapthe surface of Venus.</TEXT></DOC>
