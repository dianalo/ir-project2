In 1987, these issues rose to become part of thepublic agenda. The debate involves science, technology, and politics.Congress is responsible for {open_quotes}writing the rules{close_quotes}of what various federal agencies do and for funding their work. Thisreport surveys the points made so far in the debate, focusing on thosethat most directly influence the policy options facing the US Congress.Congressional interest focused on how to assess the rationales for conductinghuman genome projects, how to fund human genome projects (at what leveland through which mechanisms), how to coordinate the scientific and technicalprograms of the several federal agencies and private interests alreadysupporting various genome projects, and how to strike a balance regardingthe impact of genome projects on international scientific cooperationand international economic competition in biotechnology. OTA preparedthis report with the assistance of several hundred experts throughoutthe world. 342 refs., 26 figs., 11 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
