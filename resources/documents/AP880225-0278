WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   North Florida farmer Fred Williams has an analysis of the SuperTuesday primaries across the South and elsewhere: ``There are toomany hogs in the creek and the water is muddy.''   Little more than a week from the regionwide presidentialprimaries in both parties, his farm analogy remains apt. Thepicture in both parties hasn't entirely cleared, and the racesremain crowded.   Super Tuesday, the closest the nation has ever come to anational primary, could crystallize the nomination races,particularly on the Republican side. But there's as much likelihoodit won't.   Pat Robertson is a wild card that threatens to confuse theRepublican race. He has the opportunity to do well, maybe even win,in some small-turnout primaries in areas where he built devotedfollowings through years as a television evangelist.   And if no Democrat strongly emerges, that race may not comeclose to being decided on March 8 and the field will move on to thenext round of Northern industrial states, still crowded with threeor four candidates.   ``Super Tuesday is not fulfilling the wishes of its founders,''said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.   Twenty states hold Democratic primaries or caucuses on Tuesday,March 8, and they stretch from Massachusetts to Florida to Idaho;there are 17 GOP contests. The day is mainly Southern, with 14contests in Southern or border states. Democrats also hold a caucusin American Samoa.   At stake are 1,307 Democratic and 712 Republican delegates _about one-third the total in both parties.   Southern legislators set the whole thing up with the aim ofproviding a conservative or moderating influence on the Democraticnomination process, countering and perhaps stealing the thunder ofearlier contests. The GOP went along, often because Democratscontrol the legislatures in those Southern states.   The primary may yet move the Democratic nominee to the right.But it didn't diminish the early contests. Wins in Iowa and NewHampshire have helped propel Richard Gephardt and Michael Dukakisin polls of the South.   And so far no single Democrat has emerged with broad appealacross the South _ the region Democrats agree they must carry toregain the White House.   Among the Republicans, the South looks like George Bushterritory. President Reagan has always been popular there and thevice president has successfully _ so far at least _ managed toappear the heir. Polls show him leading Dole two-to-one or betterin the region.   He has the added benefit of a Southern organization regarded asunsurpassed. But all those strengths looked as thin as the paperthey were written on when Bush appeared on the verge of losing NewHampshire to Sen. Bob Dole.   Bush won, of course, but Dole, Robertson and New York Rep. JackKemp hope to attack Bush's base and prove it broad but thin.   Kemp needs to do well somewhere in the South to be able tosustain his campaign and the argument that he is the conservativealternative.   Robertson, who became known across the South and elsewhere ashost of the ``700 Club'' program on his own religious cablenetwork, has drawn a line in the dirt of South Carolina. He needsto win somewhere, and he says that's where it will be.   South Carolina isn't a Super Tuesday state; its GOP caucuses arethree days earlier. But it is being watched.   Bush has organizational and institutional strength there. ButRobertson contends the state is fertile ground for him too. Its GOPprimary usually has a low voter turnout, and crossover Democraticvoting is allowed _ a made-to-order formula for Robertson'sstrength based in fundamentalist churches.   Dole is contesting the state, too, but could finish third. Dolemust pick his shots and concentrate in areas where he can profitunder the GOP's winner-take-all rules in many congressionaldistricts and states.   Should Robertson produce victories in the South, the GOP racecould prove a prolonged and bitter fight with Bush, Dole andRobertson. But Robertson must still demonstrate he has appealbeyond his evangelical base and can be more than a disruptive forcefor the GOP.   Jesse Jackson leads in the polls in many Southern states and iscertain to do well in states with heavy black voting populations.He wants to do well in the South but will go on to the conventionin Atlanta this summer regardless.   ``He's going to have enough votes to play somebody's fiddle,''said Williams, the Grand Ridge, Fla., farmer who backs Jackson.``They'll trade for votes just like we trade pigs and cows.''   Dukakis has run well in some Southern polls and has a goodorganization in many states. As governor of Massachusetts, hecarries the image of a liberal state that triggers opposition inmany Southern quarters.   ``There is just an innate fear of somebody from Massachusetts,''said Louisiana Democratic chairman James Brady. ``They'reassociated with Tip O'Neill and Teddy Kennedy.''   But Dukakis hopes to win Florida, where he has strong support inthe southern end of the state, and perhaps Texas too. WithMassachusetts voting that day as well he could be the big delegatewinner.   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee has tried to position himselfto the right of the Democratic field, depicting the rest as liberal``peas in a pod.'' He must do well across the region, and pollshave shown him running as high as second and as low as fourth inthe region.   Rep. Richard Gephardt, winner in Iowa and South Dakota, is alsoattracting conservative and moderate Democratic voters in somestates with his well-honed appeal to concerns about foreigncompetition and a message that America is in economic decline.   He has shown strength among blue-collar voters, and so far hasconcentrated his effort in the economically hard-hitenergy-producing states of the South, where his call for anoil-import fee is a further boost. A Texas poll had him leadingthat huge delegate state but falling back after Dukakis won NewHampshire.   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois has no visible Southern strength.Gary Hart appears to be fading.   With so broad a field and so many contests, how will we know whowins Super Tuesday?   Florida and Texas are the big prizes, and if a candidate carriesboth of those, it will be hard for anyone else to argue they wonSuper Tuesday, although some no doubt will.   As the nomination race moves on, delegates are what matters.Massachusetts has the next biggest Democratic total, and Dukakisfigures to get most of them. Jackson, too, will get a big share ofSouthern delegates.   Still another measure will be the cross-over voting. It isallowed in eight of Southern and border Super Tuesday states _Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, Texasand Virginia.   A big Republican primary vote in those states, at the cost ofDemocratic votes, could be a harbinger for the fall.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Feb. 28</NOTE></DOC>
