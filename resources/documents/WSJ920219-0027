The EPA previously announced plans to limit the rules,which define hazardous waste. The regulations were thrown outby a federal appeals court here in December on the groundthat the agency hadn't properly sought public comment when itimposed them 11 years ago. Under the two regulations, anywaste is considered hazardous if it is mixed with or derivedfrom a substance that is officially classified as hazardous.</LP><TEXT>   Industry has vigorously pushed to weaken the rules,arguing that it is burdensome and excessively costly tosubject material with minimal amounts of hazardous content tothe stringent record-keeping and disposal rules that apply tohazardous substances. The rules affect most major industrialfacilities. &quot;We're looking for a rational set of rules thatonly regulates those wastes that actually present asignificant hazard,&quot; said Michael Steinberg, an attorney whoargued against the regulations in court.   Late yesterday, the EPA decided to temporarily reinstatethe old rules by putting them out for a new public commentperiod, a procedure the court had said it would allow. ByApril 28, the agency will issue for public comment aregulatory proposal indicating the directions it plans totake in narrowing the rules. Final regulations will be issuedby April 28, 1993. Under this so-called sunset provision, therules will cease to have effect on that date, if the EPAhasn't issued a proposal by then.   &quot;The aim of the proposal will be to make the nation'swaste-disposal law more rational,&quot; said Don Clay, anassistant EPA administrator. &quot;We know there are low-riskwaste streams that are currently caught by regulation thatdon't need to be.&quot;   While EPA officials had been considering whether to loosenthe rules even before the court decision, they had hoped tobe given unlimited time to do so. At the same time, industryand the White House pushed for an even faster revision, andthe rules have become a focus of the Bush administration'sderegulatory campaign. Significantly, the April 28 deadlinefor preliminary action is the last day of the president's90-day deregulation drive.   Among the options to be proposed in April, the agency islikely to include a proposal to define someconcentration-based limits, that is, levels of hazardouscontent that wouldn't automatically trigger classificationsas hazardous. Industry groups and White House officials,however, are likely to seek more-sweeping changes.   For their part, many environmental groups want tostrengthen the law, rather than limit it. Carolyn Hartmann,an attorney at US PIRG, said, &quot;The EPA and the administrationare looking for ways to let waste out of the system. Theyshould be looking for ways to get more waste into theprogram.&quot;   The hazardous-waste rules fall under the ResourceConservation and Recovery Act, the nation's mainwaste-disposal law, which is up for reauthorization thisyear.</TEXT></DOC>
