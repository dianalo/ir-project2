In April, tobacco giant RJR Nabisco Inc. fired ad agency Saatchi andamp; Saatchi DFS Inc. after the agency created ads applauding a smoking ban at client Northwest Airlines. The loss of the $84 million account stunned Saatchi, a unit of London's Saatchi andamp; Saatchi Co. PLC, as well as the advertising industry.    Now, Saatchi is facing a similar incident on a much smaller scale: yesterday its Campbell Mithun Esty unit said it parted ways with a client, the Minnesota Department of Health, because the unit's public service ads for the health department warn against smoking -- and clash with its $35 million Brown andamp; Williamson Tobacco Co. account.    Campbell Mithun handled the health department's anti-smoking advertising, which included a $1.7 million media budget, for almost two years. In print and TV commercials, it told teens that smoking leads to such embarrassments as bad breath and smelly clothes.    The alliance was doomed, however, when Campbell Mithun merged last month with another Saatchi agency, William Esty Co., to form Campbell Mithun Esty. Esty has long handled advertising for Brown andamp; Williamson, including the tobacco firm's Kool cigarettes brand.    &quot;It's obviously difficult to represent anti-tobacco and tobacco at the same time, so we withdrew from the business,&quot; a Campbell Mithun spokeswoman said, adding the decision was &quot;mutual.&quot; While Kathleen Harty, manager of the health department's section for nonsmoking and health, agreed that the decision was mutual, she added that she found it &quot;insidious&quot; nonetheless. </TEXT></DOC>
