Financiere de Suez of France, said it will takea 40% stake in Spanish brokerage firm Usera andamp; Morenes.   The accord, reached after several weeks of talks, isdesigned to strengthen Mercapital's position in thefinancial-services market, a spokesman said.</LP><TEXT>   It also reflects the growing difficulties for independentbrokerage firms in Spain's increasingly competitive stockmarket.   Usera andamp; Morenes, set up last year as a partnership betweenthree stockbrokers at the time of changes on Spain's stockmarket, was for much of last year one of Spain's marketleaders. But it ran into problems in relation to an inquiryby the Spanish National Stock Market Commission intoirregularities allegedly committed at the time of a stockoffering by oil company Repsol S.A. last year.   Though no sanctions have been announced against Usera andamp;Morenes, the negative publicity caused by the allegations ledto a fall in its business in the first quarter of this year.At the same time, staffing problems forced it to slash staffby around 50%, contributing to a first-quarter loss of 212million pesetas ($2 million).   Following its acquisition, the brokerage firm will becomea direct subsidiary of Mercapital's banking unit, Bancapital.The price of the purchase will depend on an audit of the firmcurrently in process, Mercapital said. Bancapital is 35%owned by Mercapital and has four offices, in Madrid,Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia.</TEXT></DOC>
