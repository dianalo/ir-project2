The ground shook at the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant as whiteflames and smoke poured from the 169th Pershing 1A to be destroyedunder provisions of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty.   The treaty, signed in 1987 by President Reagan and SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev, requires elimination of 859 U.S.intermediate-range and shorter range missiles and 1,752 similarSoviet missiles within three years.   The final 5,500-pound Pershing 1A, strapped on its side toreinforced stands, was destroyed in two ignitions _ one for each oftwo rocket motors.   The first burn lasted about 40 seconds and consumed one rocketstage. A half-minute later the second stage was fired for another 40seconds. The more powerful of the two rocket motors carried enoughpropellant to hurtle a 3,000-pound car about 150 miles in 45 seconds.   Some of the Soviet observers watched the operation from aconcrete bunker near the firing site. Another contingent was about1,000 feet away in a second observation area.   Gen. Maj. Vladimir Medved'ev, director of the Soviet Nuclear RiskReduction Center, watched the firing through binoculars. ``This hasbeen possible due to the new political thinking,'' he said. ``Thisis a major step in the direction of peace.''   The general presented American officials with a small sculptureof a Soviet missile destroyed under the treaty.   ``We all should be mindful that the completion of the destructionof the Pershing 1A system is proof positive that we have movedforward in our relationship with the Soviet Union,'' said Maj. Gen.Marvin D. Brailsford, commander of the U.S. Army Armament, Munitionsand Chemical Command in Rock Island, Ill.   The spent missile sections were crushed after they cooled.   The missiles marked for destruction, which have a range of 300 to3,400 miles, are not armed. Nuclear warheads and electronic guidancesystems were removed, with the warheads stored by the Department ofEnergy.   Thursday's operation, 10 months after the first Pershing 1A wasdestroyed at Longhorn, was conducted by Utah-based Thiokol Inc.,which built many of the Pershing motors at Longhorn.   The Pershing program began in 1958, with the upgrade to thePershing 1A 11 years later. Larger Pershing 2 missiles will continueto be destroyed under terms of the INF treaty. Officials say nine ofthe complete missiles already have been scrapped at Longhorn, withanother 234 heading to the junk heap.   The Soviets began destruction of several classes of similarmissiles a year ago.</TEXT></DOC>
