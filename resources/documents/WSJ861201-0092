Rose</HL><DD> 12/01/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) </IN><TEXT>   For many people, the biggest worry before retirement becomes the most pleasant surprise afterward.    The fear, of course, is not having enough money. But the fact is that the majority of retirees are doing fine. A 1984 survey of a group of retirees who have pension income in addition to Social Security found that nearly two-thirds considered their income adequate. And 98% of them received no financial help from relatives.    The retirees who fare best, retirement advisers say, are the ones living off a combination of Social Security, pensions and personal savings.    &quot;A strange thing happens when people retire,&quot; says Henry M. Wallfesh, president of Retirement Advisors, the New York consulting firm that conducted the survey. &quot;Activities and the use of time move in as the No. 1 concern. People tell us the financial strain is not as severe as they anticipated.&quot;    Those who fret about their retirement decades in advance ought to relax a bit. While retirement pundits like to say good retirement planning begins on Day 1 of Job 1, most concede that's unrealistic.    Larry Biehl, a director of the San Mateo, Calif., investment advisory firm of Bailard Biehl andamp; Kaiser, says people who start earmarking money for retirement too early find frustration before they find their goal.    &quot;You meet those heavy expense years in your 30s and 40s and the temptation to rob assets is too great,&quot; contends Mr. Biehl. &quot;Develop a savings habit in your 30s and 40s, but be realistic. That money will be spent for the new bedroom you need, another car or just to keep up with the Joneses.&quot;    For most people, retirement planning becomes an important part of financial planning only after other major obligations are out of the way. One of the first discoveries for those beginning the process is that they need less retirement income than they think.    A broad guideline used by retirement specialists is that people need 60% to 80% of their final salary to maintain the same standard of living during retirement. The higher the income, the lower the percentage needed, because a smaller portion of income is used for such basics as food and utilities.    Advisers suggest that those who are close to retirement make two lists: current expenses and post-retirement expenses. Some expenses -- such as those for mortgages, child-rearing and college tuition -- might already be gone. Others, such as those for taxes and clothing, will usually be lower during retirement.    Although some retirees insist otherwise, there's also a reduced need to put away additional savings during retirement. &quot;Retirement is the phase of life for which you've been saving all your life,&quot; says Gordon P. Ramsey, who retired from his full-time job with Coopers andamp; Lybrand this year but still gives retirement seminars in the Los Angeles area.    Some costs rise. Travel can be a big expense in the early years of retirement, while medical expenses tend to become a bigger factor later on.    A tally of income needed in retirement should be followed by an estimate of income available. Individuals within five to 10 years of retirement should make careful calculations with the help of their financial adviser, employer and local Social Security Administration office.    For a more general idea about retirement needs, use the accompanying work sheet to get an estimate of how much to save each year to meet your goal.    ---                      Saving for Retirement   You're going to retire at age 65 and die at 85. In 20years of retirement you will spend all but your currentsavings and investments. Those assumptions are used by AycoCorp. in preparing this work sheet to show how much you needto save each year to meet your retirement goal.   Use example A if you have a defined benefit pension plan,which promises a specific retirement benefit. Use example Bif you have a defined contribution pension plan, whereretirement benefits depend on both contributions to the planand the plan's investment performance.   Because this is a snapshot based on your currentsituation, periodic recalculations are advised. The figuresyou supply for each line are in today's dollars.                                       Defined                   Defined Benefit     Contribution    Your                   Plan (Ex. A)        Plan (Ex. B)    Data    1. Current salary                     $100,000            $100,000    2. Annual retirement income desired:       A broad guideline is 60% to 80%       of salary. Generally, the       higher the salary the lower       the percentage needed.                       65,000              65,000              (65% x 100,000)     (65% x 100,000)    3. Annual retirement income expected:       A. For defined benefit pension          plans: A guideline is that          Social Security and a pension          will replace 45% to 55% of          salary for workers earning          at least $30,000 who expect          to have 30 years of service at          their company. The higher the          salary, the lower the percentage.*                       50,000       B. For defined contribution pension          plans: Since those plans are          partly accounted for in line 5,          a conservative method is to enter          only your annual Social Security          benefit at this step. The current          annual benefit at age 65 for those          who have always paid the maximum          Social Security tax -- currently          those earning $42,000 and up --          is about $9,100. For a non-working          spouse, add $4,550.                                            9,100    4. Additional annual retirement income needed:       Subtract line 3 from line 2.                       15,000              55,900    5. Current annual income available:       A. Estimate how much your personal          savings and investments now earn          on an annual basis.                       10,000       B. If you have a defined contribution          pension plan, enter your current          annual earnings from your savings,          investments and that plan. (This          conservative computation does not          assume spending of principal          currently in your plan.)                                           35,000    6. Annual retirement income to be provided:       Subtract line 5 from line 4. For       those with defined benefit plans,       this amount must come from future       savings. For defined contribution       plans, it must come from both future       savings and from your employer's       contributions to your plan.                        5,000              20,900    7. Annual savings required until age 65:       Multiply line 6 by factor from       the table below. Choose factor based       on your assumptions of average       inflation and after-tax return on       investments until age 85. In the       examples, an employee 20 years from       retirement assumes 6% annual inflation       and 8% annual returns. (For those       with defined contribution plans, this       sum is provided by both your own savings       and your company's contributions       to the plan.)                        5,450              22,781               (1.09 x 5,000)     (1.09 x 20,900)   *For a more accurate estimate, check your company's annualbenefit statement or ask your employer what to expect fromyour pension plan and Social Security. If an estimate incurrent dollars isn't available, ask how to figure it outbased on the company's pension formula.   ---             Factors for Figuring Retirement Income                        (for item 7 above)                             After-Tax Return on Investments    Years to      Inflation  -------------------------------    Retirement    Rate          4%     6%     8%     10%    10              2%         1.63   1.24    .96     .74                    4          2.37   1.78   1.35    1.04                    6          3.46   2.56   1.93    1.47                    8          5.06   3.71   2.76    2.08    15              2%         1.08    .78    .56     .41                    4          1.73   1.22    .88     .64                    6          2.77   1.94   1.38     .99                    8          4.46   3.09   2.16    1.53    20              2%          .80    .54    .37     .25                    4          1.41    .94    .63     .43                    6          2.50   1.65   1.09     .73                    8          4.41   2.87   1.89    1.25    25              2%          .63    .40    .25     .16                    4          1.23    .77    .48     .30                    6          2.39   1.47    .92     .57                    8          4.63   2.83   1.73    1.07</TEXT></DOC>
