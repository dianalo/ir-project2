Lehner (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> JAPAN </CO><DATELINE> TOKYO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Toshio Ichiki remembers the tension aboard the destroyer Kagero just before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He remembers the exultation and relief when he and his crewmates saw the bombers and torpedo planes returning to the carriers.    But the former navigation officer doesn't recall any qualms over the sneak attack or any other aspect of Japan's role in World War II. Nor did he develop any qualms in his 13 years as a government military historian, during which he researched the Japanese occupation of China in the 1930s.    &quot;I have studied this history, I have lived through the flow of this history, and I don't think that what Japan did before and during the war was aggression,&quot; the 69-year-old Mr. Ichiki declares.    A growing number of Japanese seem to agree. Last April, a cabinet minister proclaimed that Japan didn't have any &quot;aggressive intentions&quot; when it occupied parts of China. He was eventually forced to resign, but for lack of diplomacy, not historical inaccuracy. A group of 41 ruling-party politicians announced their support for his view that Japan has no reason to apologize for its past actions.    &quot;I'll bet every member of the cabinet secretly shares that view,&quot; gloats Hideaki Kase, a conservative writer who shares it himself.    Precisely because they fear Mr. Kase is right, many people in other countries, particularly other Asian countries, worry about Japanese attitudes toward World War II. They see a Japan that wields incredible economic power and clearly wants a greater political role in the world. They see Japan's growing self-confidence, its anger and frustration at constant foreign criticism of its trade policies, and its ever-present sense of racial uniqueness. They are disturbed by suggestions that Japan wants to rewrite history to portray itself as a victim rather than as an aggressor.    Are these fears justified? Certainly, some Japanese are working feverishly to promote a revisionist view of World War II. They want to play down Japan's aggression in the 1930s by substituting &quot;advance into China&quot; for &quot;invasion of China&quot; in textbooks. They contest what they see as exaggerated casualty estimates from the 1937 incident in Nanking, China, in which Japanese troops rampaged for days, raping and slaughtering Chinese civilians.    But these revisionists are still very much on the fringe. Talks with dozens of Japanese produce a more complex picture of current attitudes toward World War II. The spectrum of opinion is wide, and some Japanese harbor what appear to be contradictory views. One Japanese college student says Japan was the aggressor in the war, but he adds, in the same breath, that it didn't have any choice.    Although the majority doesn't agree with Mr. Kase, it is clear that fewer and fewer Japanese feel much guilt about the war. The unanswerable question is whether mainstream attitudes are drifting toward making the majority susceptible to the revisionist view in the future.    Unlike the Germans, who are still agonizing over how they went wrong, many Japanese never think about World War II at all. If the German character is to brood over history, &quot;the Japanese character is to forget,&quot; says Takashi Hosomi, a former Finance Ministry official who was an army corporal during the war. &quot;It comes from the climate. The typhoons come and take everything. The next day we have beautiful weather, and the Japanese people say, 'The sky is clear. Let's start again.'&quot;    A Japanese intellectual puts it more sharply: &quot;The West Germans are trying to learn from the war experience. The Japanese are trying to bury it.&quot;    Young people, in particular, know little and care little about the war. It is as distant to them as the War of 1812 is to Americans; one Japanese college professor says some of his students don't even know that the U.S. occupied Japan for seven years after the war ended.    Schools are supposed to teach students that Japan was the aggressor in China in the 1930s and that its actions eventually led to war with the U.S. Some young people do take that message to heart. In a school workbook, on the page describing Japan's occupation of Manchuria in 1931, a 12-year-old boy living in a Tokyo suburb scrawled: &quot;Nihon wa zurui!!&quot; -- Japan cheats!!    But many young people know little about the war. Hidetaro Inoue, a Tokyo University junior born more than 20 years after it ended, and his friends &quot;never talk about it at all,&quot; he says. He has a vague sense that Japan was an aggressor but confesses ignorance of the details. In his high-school course on Japanese history, he adds, &quot;the school year ended while we were still in the Meiji era {1868-1912}.&quot;    Had the year been longer, Mr. Inoue still might not have learned much. Even before the revisionists got to work, Japanese history textbooks were woefully inadequate. Some, for example, don't mention Japan's harsh colonization of Korea from 1910 to 1945. &quot;West Germany gives young people tough criticism of the Nazi era,&quot; complains a Korean diplomat who worries that 30% to 40% of Japanese sympathize with the view that Japan did nothing wrong in Korea. &quot;But the Japanese government does not do that kind of thorough education.&quot;    After years of commemorations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, many Japanese tend to remember what was done to them rather than what they did to others. During a night of sake drinking, a Japanese businessman in his 40s who deals frequently with foreigners confesses that he regrets that Japan didn't defeat the U.S. He is apologetic about what Japan did to China but not about Pearl Harbor. How, he demands emotionally, could Americans have murdered so many innocent Japanese civilians at Hiroshima and Nagasaki?    Self-justifying sentiments are strongest and most widespread among Japanese who fought in the war or were educated before it. This may partly explain the support for whitewashing Japan's past among Diet members; many are elderly men.    Historian Ikuhiko Hata of Takushoku University in Tokyo is among those holding to the we-did-wrong view that dominated Japan in the 1950s. He sees &quot;less than 10% justification&quot; for the occupation of Manchuria and at most 30% justification for anything Japan did in China. To Mr. Okuno's argument that &quot;the white races had already colonized much of Asia,&quot; Mr. Hata retorts: &quot;We can't justify our aggression by citing the white man's aggression.&quot;    But Mr. Hata worries that voices such as his are becoming less influential. &quot;Reaction to the dominant view is gaining power,&quot; he says. Right after the war, he says, Japanese regarded Gen. Hideki Tojo, Japan's prime minister from 1941 to 1944, as &quot;a symbol of evil,&quot; and most Japanese agreed with the Tokyo War Crimes Trial verdict declaring him a &quot;Class A war criminal.&quot; Now, Mr. Hata says, more and more Japanese regard him as a &quot;scapegoat&quot; or a victim of &quot;victor's justice.&quot;    Observing the changing attitudes, a few Japanese fear the worst. Hiraku Inoue, deputy general secretary of the Japan Congress Against A- and H-Bombs, worries that &quot;a new system of fascism might be coming.&quot;    Revisionism is progressing in step with Japan's growing awareness of its economic strength, which bolsters its self-confidence. Earlier in the postwar era, when Japan was poor and struggling to export, a sense of fragility, even inferiority, kept most Japanese from thinking -- or at least voicing -- self-justifying ideas about the war.    But now, &quot;there's a self-confidence bordering on arrogance or smugness,&quot; says Tadashi Yamamoto, who heads a Tokyo-based cultural-exchange organization. &quot;America is declining, Europe is declining, but we're doing just fine.&quot;    As a result of this self-confidence, many Japanese, at the very least, are in no mood for self-flagellation. Earlier this year, the Japanese distributor of Bernardo Bertolucci's &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; wanted to make cuts before showing the film here. The distributor said it feared that Japanese moviegoers would avoid the film rather than sit through its newsreel footage of what has come to be known as the Rape of Nanking. The distributor eventually restored some, but not all, of the cuts at Mr. Bertolucci's insistence.    Affluence and self-confidence also have a more subtle, fundamental effect on Japanese attitudes, Mr. Hata says. &quot;Younger people who don't know much about Japanese modern history believe that our prosperity cannot be the product of such a miserable history,&quot; he says. &quot;Japan must have behaved correctly, otherwise we wouldn't have this prosperity.&quot;    Now, some people are asking whether rewriting history presages rearmament. For most, the answer is no. They argue that most Japanese consider low defense outlays one of the sources of Japan's economic strength, and few want to trade butter for guns. &quot;It's true, as foreigners say, that never before has a country had such economic power without having military power. In that sense, Japan is trying to have a vast experiment,&quot; says Hajime Izumi, a professor at Shizuoka University in Shizuoka. &quot;But we Japanese have high confidence that this experiment will succeed. We must do a better job of explaining our confidence to foreigners.&quot;    Mr. Izumi adds that although young people know little about the war, &quot;there is no sentiment among them in favor of turning Japan into a militarist nation.&quot;    An oft-noted irony -- that with Asia liberated from Western colonialism as a result of the war, Japan has today achieved economically much of what it had sought militarily -- also tends to encourage revisionist thinking. In its pre-war propaganda, Japan said it wanted to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to liberate Asia from the white man. Actually, its attitudes were far more complex. They ranged from contempt for other Asians (one ditty sung by Japanese schoolchildren before the war went, &quot;Chinka, Chinka, Chinka, So stupid and they stinka&quot;) to a strong feeling that history, destiny and economic necessity gave Japan the right to dominate Asia economically.    Sadao Mogami, an army veteran, likes to tell what he considers an instructional story about his British business contact in Singapore in the 1960s.    The contact was a longtime resident of Southeast Asia, and Japanese troops had beheaded his elder sister during the war and hung her head from a bridge to frighten British civilians. But despite his strong distaste for the Japanese, the contact, according to Mr. Mogami, believed that &quot;100 years from now, there's going to be the opinion that Japan contributed a lot to the liberation of Asia.&quot; Mr. Mogami clearly believes this, too. </TEXT></DOC>
