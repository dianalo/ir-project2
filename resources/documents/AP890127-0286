Even discreet dealings are under scrutiny by investigatorsexamining mountains of documents subpoenaed in the probe of theChicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade, wherefortunes are made and lost betting on the future prices ofeverything from pig bellies to Treasury bonds.   More than 200 traders, brokers and financial firms also have beensubpoenaed and fear has pervaded trading pits where millions ofdollars in commodities futures are bought and sold daily.   Federal officials are refusing to comment, but the investigationreportedly centers on allegations that as many as 100 brokers andtraders systematically cheated customers and profited themselves inillegal trades.   The probe hasn't produced indictments yet. But insiders predictit will wipe out fortunes and could lead to sweeping changes in oneof Chicago's most vital and oldest industries.   Those caught in the FBI trap could face charges ranging fromfraud to racketeering, said Harvey Silets, an attorney forsubpoenaed traders at both exchanges.   ``It's going to be bad,'' said a former Mercantile Exchangetrader who now works for a top brokerage. ``There's going to be alot of punishment meted out. There's going to be a lot of guiltypleading and guilty finding.''   BOT and Merc officials, along with traders and others who earntheir living at the exchanges, complain that the highly publicizedinvestigation wrongly implies the industry is full of crooks.   ``The vast majority of the people down there are honest...justtrying to make a buck,'' said a trader in the Board of Trade'sTreasury bond pit, which was infiltrated by an FBI agent wearing ahidden microphone and posing as a trader.   But other industry insiders say in a field that attracts younghotshots eager for a fast fortune, odds for fraud are high.   ``I would say that people in this business are going to besubjected to much more temptation,'' said the former MercantileExchange trader, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivitysurrounding the probe.   ``You have relatively young, relatively inexperienced people in afield where very, very, very large sums of money are moving aroundvery quickly.''   In a typical transaction, an investor phones a brokerage andorders a commodity at the market price. The order goes a phone clerkat the firm's trading-floor booth.   The clerk writes the order on a floor-order ticket and gives itto a firm ``runner'' who literally runs to a floor broker by thetrading pit. The floor broker asks other pit traders for the currentprice.   Once he finds someone selling at the best price for his client _it usually takes less than a minute _ the floor broker exchangeshand or eye signals with the trader to seal the deal.   The trader documents it on a trading card while the brokerrecords the transaction on the order card. The deal is punched intoa computer.   Insiders say the system invites opportunities for illicitpractices.   ``If we're talking about fraud against the customer order, theeasiest way and the hardest way to catch'' occurs when a customerplaces a ``limit'' order, saying he'll pay no more than a certainprice, said the former Merc trader.   Instead of buying for the customer at the market price, say $7,the floor broker gambles the price will rise. With pit pricesfluctuating, the floor broker winks to a trader friend as the pricehits $7, and the trader buys from an innocent third-party at thatprice.   ``If the market goes up to $8, I buy from (the trader-friend) at$8, he made $1 and the customer paid $8'' when he could have paidonly $7, the ex-trader said.   ``What you're doing is holding the order off the market for abrief period of time'' _ seconds _ with hopes the price will riseand allow for illegal profiteering, called bucketing or cuffing, hesaid.   ``Absent a sting operation ... or a pattern, it is very, veryhard to detect,'' said Stephen Selig, a futures law professor at NewYork University.   Such deals aren't common but they're said to be a target of theFBI probe.   ``It's bad, it's malicious and it's thievery and people who getcaught doing it should be hung,'' said the ex-trader. ``They havemaliciously removed money from the game and they should gethammered.''   But he and other insiders fear the government also will prosecuteothers who violate exchange rules, but don't necessarily hurt anyone.   One such practice is called trading at the curb, or after thesession ends, to reconcile discrepancies that arise in the confusionof a hectic market.   ``People are concerned that the BOT has done a very good job ofpolicing its own members ... (and) that people who don't understandour business ... are going to wind up having authority over it,''said the Treasury bond trader.   The Merc and BOT quickly punish rule violators, said RichardTroelstrup, an attorney who represents at least one supboena target.The hard part is catching violators, and the industry largelydepends on members to police themselves.   The probe began two years ago after Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., aDecatur, Ill.-based agricultural conglomerate, complained it wascheated by soybean traders.   ``One of the people that perceived themselves being wronged wasmore connected in Washington than God,'' the ex-Merc trader said,referring to ADM's chairman, Dwayne Andreas.   ``His people complained to the BOT, `We think we're gettingripped off in the soybean pit.' The BOT investigated and didn't findanything,'' but Andreas wasn't satisified and sought governmenthelp, he said.   ``My guess is ADM (was) just losing money...having a rough timein the market,'' and wanted a scapegoat, the ex-trader said.   ADM spokesman Richard Burket and BOT aides have declined tocomment.   Officials at both exchanges say they did not learn of theinvestigation until the Tribune published its story.   Traders ``were taken totally by surprise'' to learn that some pitcolleagues were FBI agents, said the Treasury Bond trader.   Legitimate traders may not have suspected an FBI sting, but insome cases the undercover agents behaved oddly. One, for example,lost heavily one day and mysteriously bounced back.   ``He attracted attention because there was no known source offunds'' to account for the recovery,'' Troelstrup said. ``As itturned out, he had a rather deep source of funds'' _ the government.   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission _ the federal regulatoryagency of the commodities markets _ says it has adequately policedthe industry.   Nonetheless, the Mercantile Exchange has appointed a panel ofindustry and outside representatives to review transaction rules andrecommend revisions.   ``We have to prove to the world that we can be an honest placewhere a public order will not be subject to dishonest hands,'' saidLeo Melamed, chief counsel at the Merc.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday Jan. 29</NOTE></DOC>
