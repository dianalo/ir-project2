Trustees for the $63 billion California pension fund knownas Calpers told Nomura Capital Management -- which manages$400 million in stocks for Calpers -- to stop tradingsecurities for that account through Nomura's brokerage arm.Nomura was ordered to use only outside brokers, as it alreadydoes for most trades executed for Calpers.</LP><TEXT>   But Calpers decided to allow New York-based Nomura Capitalto retain the Calpers investment account. It was in danger oflosing that business and had been put on probation this monthby Calpers after Nomura and other Japanese securities firmsadmitted reimbursing clients for investment losses.   About 17% of the trades for the Calpers account have beenhandled by Nomura itself in the past. Calpers officials saidthey couldn't be more specific about the amount ofcommissions that Nomura will lose as a result of the newtrading restrictions.   In New York, a Nomura spokesman said the firm was&quot;satisfied with the quick resolution of the issue.&quot;   In addition to the Nomura action, Calpers this weekdecided to stop trading government bonds through SalomonBrothers Inc. after Salomon's admissions that it violatedbidding rules for Treasury securities. Calpers also placedSalomon on probation, but said it would continue to tradenon-government securities through the firm as investigationsinto Salomon's activities continue.</TEXT></DOC>
