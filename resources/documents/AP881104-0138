The charge came in a statement signed by Islamic Jihad, orIslamic Holy War, and was accompanied by a photograph of Americanjournalist Terry A. Anderson, the longest-held of the 14 foreignhostages in Lebanon.   It was delivered in a sealed envelope to a Western news agency.   The photo, which was different from the previous 13 pictures ofAnderson released by the kidnappers, showed him wearing glasses, awhite t-shirt and with a mustache. In a videotaped message releasedOct. 30, he had no mustache.   In the photo, Anderson was facing a birthday cake with candlesand looked straight into the camera. His right hand appeared readyto clasp a knife to cut the cake. The kidnappers did not say whenthe photo was taken.   Anderson marked his 41st birthday, his fourth in captivity, Oct.27.   ``The only safe way to the freedom of the captives and theirsafety is the implementation of our just demands. This is theessential cornerstone in this issue, nothing else,'' the statement,typed in Arabic, said. It did not spell out the demands.   The statement stressed that the release of the hostages was notconnected with the Aug. 20 cease-fire that halted the eight-yearIran-Iraq war.   ``We repeat for a thousandth time that the issue of the captivesaltogether is not in any way linked to what happens in the (Persian)gulf. The hope that prevailed in the past has gone forever,'' thestatement said.   ``Failure to free the hostages is a result of the Americanheresy, procrastination and reneging on pledges and promises,'' thestatement said.   It rebutted President Reagan's assertion that the kidnappersforced Anderson to read his latest videotaped statement, in whichthe hostage accused the U.S. government of interfering to stop hisrelease.   In that statement, Anderson read a message accusing Reagan andVice President George Bush of failing to do enough to secure hisrelease.   It said, ``I've been very close to being released several timesover the past two years. But each time it seems that the U.S.government uses its influence to stop any agreement from being made.And I don't understand this.''   Reagan denied his administration was bargaining with terrorists,saying: ``I don't think that was Terry speaking. I think he had ascript that was given to him.''   The message Anderson read said Reagan and Bush negotiated withterrorists in the Iran-Contra affair and the 1985 hijack of a TWAjetliner to Beirut.   Bush has denied he was involved in the Iran-Contra affair or inany negotiations with the TWA hijackers, who held 39 Americans for17 days. More than 700 Arab prisoners were released from a northernIsraeli prison in the weeks following the hijacking.   Today's Islamic Jihad statement said, ``The videotape,irrespective of its contents, has been issued directly by TerryAnderson without any pressure.''   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman stood bythe administration's contention that Anderson's taped remarks weremade under duress. ``Anytime you have people being held hostage _tapes, letters those kinds of things _ are by definition underduress,'' he said.   Asked whether the United States had gone back on a deal, as thekidnappers alleged, for the release of the hostages, Redman said:``Absolutely not. There have ben no deals. We don't make deals.''   The Islamic Jihad statement promised that Anderson ``will make anadequate answer'' to the denials made by Reagan and Bush, but didnot specify when.   The statement said Islamic Jihad's hostages ``are not isolatedfrom he outside world.   ``They see and hear the news from newspapers, magazines andtelevision stations. They are aware of everything that happened orwill happen about their situation.   ``What Reagan has said in this regard is like the ostrich thathides her head in the sand so that the hunter will not see her.''   The statement also said: ``The U.S. administration, representedby its president, his vice president, staff and aides carried outall the deals concerning the hostages.   ``Otherwise who negotiated in the TWA hijack and why were the 40passengers and 735 prisoners in Israeli jails freed? Who alsonegotiated in the Iran-Contra affair? Who gave the weapons and tookthe money and funneled its to the Contras?''   The 14 foreign hostages in Lebanon include nine Americans.   Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, was kidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
