Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said 1,577civilians were killed and 3,442 wounded during the period, Jan. 20to June 21. He blamed the rebels for the civilian casulties.   Afghan soldiers began taking over the fight against insurgents inJanuary, and the last of an estimated 115,000 Red Army soldiers leftFeb. 15, ending nine years of involvement in Afghaistan's civil war.   In Islamabad, Pakistan, a rebel spokesman said Afghan rebels andSoviet Embassy officials agreed at talks Monday that rebels heldprisoner in Kabul will be released in exchange for captured Sovietsoldiers.   But an official release from the embassy said final approval mustcome from the ruling Marxists in Kabul.   The spokesman said on condition of anonymity that both sides willexchange lists of prisoners at another round of talks to be heldwithin the next week. But he said the principle of a mass exchange,demanded by insurgents at previous negotiation sessions, wasendorsed.   The guerrillas say 40,000 rebels are missing in action. No numberwas given for Soviet prisoners.   Local authorities in Peshawar, Pakistan, meanwhile said oneperson was killed Monday and three people were seriously hurt when amedium-range Scud missile, presumably fired from Kabul, hitPakistani territory less than a mile from the border.   More than 3 million Afghan war refugees live in Pakistan, most ofthem in camps near the border.   When Soviet military forces were in the country, Afghan soldiersjoined them in military operations but rarely acted alone. Mosleminsurgents began fighting after a coup in April 1978 and the Sovietsentered the war in December 1979.   Amani said he did not have guerrilla casualties since Jan. 20,but he said at least 12,000 had been killed in the battle forJalalabad alone. Guerrillas began attacking the city March 6.   On Monday, Amani said the government had effective control ofJalalabad, which 75 miles east of Kabul and 45 miles from theborder. Most of the guerrillas are based in Pakistan and receivesupport from the United States.   According to Amani, the guerrillas fired more than 337,000rockets and artillery shells in Afghanistan during the periodcovered by the report, including 136,140 at Jalalabad.   Afghanistan refuses to reveal the size of the army, but diplomatsestimate it has about 80,000 men.   Amani also reported that photojournalist Tony O'Brien of SantaFe, N.M., accused of entering the country illegally and held byAfghan police, was in good health and saw American news magazines onMonday for the first time in 19 days.   He said that Edward Desmond, New Delhi bureau chief of Time Inc.,brought magazines and novels for the 42-year-old free-lancejournalist, who was on assignment for Time Inc.   Amani said Afghan troops captured O'Brien on June 8, not June 14as reported earlier, in Wardak Province next to Kabul. He saidO'Brien was found in rebel company.   Police have yet to charge O'Brien, nor have they allowed Desmondor others to meet him.   Afghan authorities say they are awaiting the arrival of a U.S.diplomat from New Delhi in the case. They said he could not come toKabul on Monday because of air transportation difficulties.</TEXT></DOC>
