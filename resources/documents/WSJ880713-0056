London shares fell, turning sharply lower in the final hour of trading.    The Nikkei index finished up 113.85 points at 28099.84. It was the first time the index had pierced the 28000 level in 18 days. The Tokyo Stock Exchange first section index, which rose 2.65 points Monday, rose an additional 7.41 points to close at 2207.97.    In mid-morning trading in Tokyo Wednesday, share prices had eased and the Nikkei index stood at 28089.40, down 10.44 points.    But some analysts worry about the concentration of the turnover. Although Tuesday's volume was a hefty 1.9 billion shares, 97% of the morning turnover and 80% of the afternoon trading was in the 30 most active stocks, according to Stephen Codrington, head of equity sales at Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd. in Tokyo. Ron Napier, an economist at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd., said 63% of the day's trading was in the 10 most active stocks.    &quot;It's a game played with very few cards,&quot; Mr. Napier said. &quot;There's very little broad interest. It's a trading market, and when these kinds of markets encounter bad news they tend to trade off very hard.&quot;    No bad news looms on the immediate horizon, but most foreigners, at least, aren't likely to buy Japanese shares in big quantities until after Friday's U.S. trade figures are released. A U.S. trade deficit narrower than the expected $10.5 billion to $12 billion range would be good news for the dollar and hence bad news for Japanese stocks.    Steel stocks have boosted the Tokyo rally a number of times in the last few weeks. Among steels Tuesday, NKK (Nippon Kokan) was the most heavily traded. It gained 37 yen to close at 690 yen ($5.17) as 265.3 million shares changed hands. Nippon Steel was up 21 yen to 709 on volume of 198.5 million shares, while Sumitomo Metal Industries rose 44 yen to 619.    Among heavy industrials, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries closed at 977 yen, up 41, as 231 million shares changed hands.    Auto makers were also mostly higher Tuesday. Traders said that, unlike the gains for steels and heavy industrials, which were based largely on buying by investors seeking short-term profits, the auto makers attracted interest more on expectations of improving earnings.    Toyota gained 90 yen to 2560, while Honda added 80 yen to 1820 and Nissan firmed 50 yen to 1230 on volume of 56.9 million shares.    In London, trading was quiet, and Wall Street's weakness was cited in the late falloff in prices.    The Financial Times 100-Share Index fell 18.3 points to 1858.5. The narrower 30-share index fell 16.2 points to 1494.3. Volume was 398 million shares, compared with 416 million a day earlier.    Impending data scheduled for release later in the week kept players cautious and on the sidelines. Of particular concern is Thursday's expected spate of U.K. corporate earnings reports and figures on British unemployment, average earnings and industrial output, as well as Friday's release of U.S. trade data for May and the U.K. retail price index for June.    Ranks Hovis McDougall leaped 18 pence to 420 pence ($7.09) on volume of 5.2 million shares. Dealers said market talk continued that Australian-based food group Goodman Fielder Ltd. is enlarging its 29.9% stake in the food company.    British Aerospace continued to command the attention of the market, gaining further ground on the back of last week's #10 billion ($16.9 billion) order for British military equipment by Saudi Arabia, dealers said. The shares finished a penny higher at 466 on volume of 5.3 million shares, after trading as high as 477.    Lower crude oil prices weighed down oil shares, as takeover hopes within the sector were being dashed, analysts said.    Among oil majors, Shell Transport andamp; Trading fell 17 pence to #10.43, Burmah Oil was down 8 at 526, and Enterprise Oil gave up 6 to 468. British Petroleum, down 5 at 259, also was hit by nervousness as to what the Kuwait Investment Office might do with its 22% holding in BP. The stake is currently being investigated by the U.K. Monopolies and Mergers Commission.    Elsewhere, dollar-earning international shares were generally lower, due mostly to lack of interest after pronounced gains over the past month. Imperial Chemical Industries fell 19 to #10.70, Glaxo Holdings was down 16 at 993 and Reuters rose 13 to 565.    In Frankfurt, prices closed lower across the board in quiet trading amid uncertainty over the dollar and interest rates.    Brokers said the Frankfurt market is still overbought following its heavy gains last week and is prone to profit-taking and technical selling. Uncertainty over the Bundesbank's interest-rate policy is also depressing share prices, they said.    Financial issues, which tend to profit from higher interest rates, and retailing stocks suffered the largest losses, while chemical shares closed mixed to higher.    Dresdner Bank tumbled 8.50 marks to 256 marks ($138.75), and Deutsche Bank fell 7.50 marks to 475. Commerzbank declined 4.60 marks to 232.20.    Among retailers, Kaufhof slipped 9 marks to 361, and Karstadt fell 6 marks to 435.    Chemical shares outperformed the market, as Hoechst firmed one mark to 273 and Bayer gained 90 pfennigs to 293 marks. BASF edged down 2 pfennigs to 255. Pharmaceutical concern Schering slumped 6 marks to 520.50.    Daimler-Benz suffered the largest loss in the auto sector, dropping 7.50 marks to 713.50, and Volkswagen dipped 3.50 marks to 260. Bayerische Motoren Werke was off 2 marks to 523.50.    Machinery maker Linde slid 7.50 marks to 672.50, and Mannesmann fell 2.10 marks to 153.70.    Elsewhere in Europe, prices closed lower in Paris, Zurich and Amsterdam, were mixed in Brussels and Stockholm and higher in Milan. In Pacific markets, prices closed higher in Hong Kong and Singapore, were mixed in Manila and Wellington and lower in Sydney, Taipei and Seoul.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
