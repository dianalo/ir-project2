<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-83-1142 </DOCNO><TEXT>Cable tray and conduit systems have an excellent earthquake performancerecord. This has been evidenced at over 70 power and industrial facilitiesin 14 past major earthquakes, and is reinforced by shake table test dataand detailed analyses. A method is developed for utilizing this datain defensible, simple seismic qualification criteria and configurationcontrols. Qualitiative comparisons are used to demonstrate the applicabilityof the data base to the given cable tray/conduit system. Quantitativeassessments are used to guarantee that the support system is as leastas adequate as the data base support systems that survived without apparentdamage. The results are incorporated into field evaluation guidelinesand also form the basis for configuration control criteria. This methodresults in significant cost savings to nuclear utilities, realized atthe engineering effort, plant hardware modification, and documentationlevels.</TEXT></DOC>
