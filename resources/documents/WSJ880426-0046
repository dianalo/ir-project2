In addition, the Seattle-based aerospace giant said it received a $1.4 billion order for 30 commercial jetliners from International Leisure Group. The parent company of Air Europe, a relatively new British carrier, International Leisure ordered 22 Boeing 757-200s to be delivered starting in 1989, and eight 737-400s to be delivered starting in April 1990.    Boeing said the order, subject to the completion of financing, increases to 270 the firm orders it has taken for its 757 airliner, and to 2,036 the orders for its 737 model.    Boeing, which held its annual shareholders meeting yesterday, said first-quarter net was $136 million, or 89 cents a share, on revenue of $3.61 billion, compared with $118 million, or 76 cents a share, on revenue of $3.76 billion a year earlier. It attributed the rise in net largely to lower research and development spending on commercial aircraft, military and space programs, and a lower federal tax rate.    But the company said that increased research, development and production expenses for its commuter aircraft business, &quot;significant performance problems on several military aircraft programs,&quot; and increased cost-sharing expenses on certain government contracts partially offset those gains.    Boeing said U.S. government and foreign military sales fell $200 million in the first quarter, to $1.1 billion.    The increase in Boeing's quarterly dividend to 40 cents a share from 35 cents, payable June 10 to shareholders of record on May 13, was the first rise since January 1987, when it announced a boost in the payout from 30 cents.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Boeing shares rose $1.375 to close at $47.    Boeing, which has projected total 1988 revenue of around $17 billion, said that if a current strike continues beyond mid-May at Snecma, a French aerospace concern, Boeing's deliveries of some jetliner models could be delayed.    Snecma and General Electric Co. collaborate on the engines that power current models of the Boeing 737, and Snecma factories are used to assemble the CF6 engine used on certain 747 and 767 models, Boeing said. Boeing expects to have engines available to meet 737 deliveries through July, and 747 and 767 deliveries through September.    Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman and chief executive officer, said the company continues to be in a &quot;transition period&quot; for both its commercial transport and military and space business segments.    Mr. Shrontz said that consolidation and privatization trends in the global airline industry as well as intense competition among airplane makers will continue to result in pricing pressures. Increased demand for manufacturers to help buyers finance their purchases and dispose of used planes will also result, he said.    Boeing noted that U.S. government pressure to limit defense and space spending had already hurt two of the company's programs. Boeing said it stopped work on an anti-satellite program when Congress cut off funds for the program.    The company also said its contract to develop a launching and control system for the Air Force's Small Intercontinental Ballistic Missile was cut by $278 million.    Mr. Shrontz said Boeing's cash and short-term investments increased to $4 billion as of March 31, from $3.44 billion at Dec. 31. The increase was mostly due to the repayment of $700 million of convertible notes by Allegis Corp., parent of United Airlines, and cash flow from operations, and was partly offset by a $486 million federal tax payment. </TEXT></DOC>
