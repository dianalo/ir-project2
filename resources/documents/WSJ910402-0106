Ferguson</HL><DATE>04/02/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A21</SO><LP>   The self-described &quot;Russian Jew&quot; from Kiev got by on15-cent Thrifty Drug Store ice-cream cones in his first,job-hunting month in Los Angeles. On Saturdays, he'd splurgeon a McDonald's &quot;cherry pie.&quot; Norman (nee Naum) Taver had asweet tooth and little else. He savors the memory just as heseems to love everything about life, 11 years later.   If the loss of Soviet-educated talent was ever alegitimate reason for Moscow's crackdown on emigration in theearly 1980s, Mr. Taver could have been the poster boy.Trained in architecture, industrial design and chemicalengineering, he found ample opportunity here. He helped builda wind tunnel for a NASA contractor and designed a piece ofFlorida's Epcot Center before peeling off to make cosmetics.Today his Rosa West Inc. produces dozens of creams andcleansers for wife Raya's West Hollywood salon and otherprivate labels.</LP><TEXT>   The Tavers are another example of immigrants infusingAmerican business with ingenuity and drive, and they're alsoa new wrinkle on the LA story. America's premiere ethnic stewhas recognizable Latin American and East Asian flavors, butLos Angeles today is home to multitudes of other newcomers,such as Armenians, Iranians and what passes for Russians.(Mr. Taver, like many Jews from the Ukraine, doesn't identifywith that republic.) At least 50,000 Soviet Jews -- maybetwice that -- have settled in and around the city, making itsdiaspora second in the U.S. only to New York. The Los Angelescount is fuzzy because so many, like the Tavers, weresupposed to settle elsewhere.   Nowadays Mr. Taver, 52, enjoys plenty of borscht andherring. But, sleeping in the kitchen of friends' tinyapartment on that first trip to Los Angeles, he could onlydream about food. He went to a jobs reception where,famished, he gobbled so much that he was nearly sick when itcame time for his interview.   The Tavers and their two children initially were resettledby the Jewish community of Des Moines. The heat and humiditythat greeted them that 1979 Iowa summer weren't the onlyreasons they stayed less than a year. On the taxi ride fromthe airport that first night, Norman asked, &quot;Where is thecity?&quot; He was in it.   A minimal sleeper, he would rise early to find no activityon the streets. &quot;In my eyes, America was America: Wilshire(Boulevard) and Manhattan,&quot; he says. The heartland was rathera letdown. The family was treated well and Mr. Taver foundwork designing shopping centers, but a recession found himeager to move on.   &quot;One day, economy is bad, people start to disappear --nice people, but no more,&quot; he recollects in his adoptedEnglish. &quot;I asked, what is `lay-off'?&quot; His boss told him,&quot;Don't worry -- nobody dies in America. You don't have a jobhere, you get a job somewhere else.&quot; He was given a month'svacation to go looking in his &quot;big Chrysler car.&quot; He drovestraight to Los Angeles. The family soon followed.   Mr. Taver cheerily describes each challenge. In hishomeland, being Jewish held him back, he knew, but he gotinto decent schools and jobs. He got special instruction aspart of a belated Soviet attempt to address the&quot;social-psychological&quot; aspects of product design -- a nod tothe capitalist concept of marketing. The training stays withhim. These days, for instance, he puts gold-colored trim oncosmetic packages to give them an upscale look.   His industrial jobs, like many in the Soviet Union, hadmilitary applications, so his exit visa had to wait fiveyears for his security clearance to lapse. He was put incharge of public art projects. He recalls jousting with one&quot;party boss&quot; over the proper number and placement of Leninbusts at an exhibit. &quot;Meantime you get lot of art -- noteverything was Lenin,&quot; he smiles. Mr. Taver's mosaics forfactory exteriors paid the requisite homage: &quot;little bitrevolution, little bit workers. . . .&quot;   Wryly painting himself as apolitical, Mr. Tavernevertheless has an eye for more than commerce. He is &quot;amazedby the culture&quot; available to him in Los Angeles. Rock andclassical music abound, and he says he can find at UCLA &quot;aRussian library better than the district library in Kiev.&quot;He's avid about the personal computers that dot Rosa West'sfacility.   But he says the intellectual base he brought with him toAmerica didn't necessarily give him an advantage over otherimmigrants. &quot;People who don't have background sometimessucceed better than people who do,&quot; he says. &quot;I tell you why.In America, many ways to make money. Dry-cleaning shop, youinvest in that.&quot; Doing blueprints for wind tunnels was aprofession with no payoff at the end.   It wasn't long, however, before he was consulting ondesign at night and spending days at a drafting board in thelast booth of Raya's original La Cienega Boulevard salon. Heschmoozed the customers and picked up on the business. Soonhe was assembling piece by scrap piece the machinery to mix,bottle and label a small run of varied skin products.   According to Cornelia Stanek of Kline andamp; Co., a New Jerseyresearch firm, premium facial creams are in vogue, andCalifornia is a proving ground for cosmetic innovations. Mr.Taver says he meets European quality standards, minimizingthe amount of emulsifiers. But he can do it on his makeshiftassembly line -- actually it resembles a supersize garageworkshop -- at &quot;working-girl&quot; prices and in the small lotsthat a start-up retailer demands.   Mr. Taver calls himself a &quot;garbage man&quot; for havingfrequented LA's industrial junkyards collecting equipment hethen refurbished. A second mortgage on his home fundedpurchase of a small San Fernando Valley industrial buildinghe converted two years ago. He maintains only a handful ofstaff -- family or other immigrants -- and is using hisskills to computerize the manufacturing process so that hewon't need much help even as he prepares to grow the businessrapidly. (Total sales are still under $300,000 annually, hesays.)   Here, then, is a products business built from scratch onbrains, energy and a smile. Not all Soviet emigres, inparticular, have warmed to the American marketplace, butclearly Mr. Taver has. He didn't need an SBA loan or aset-aside or even the crutch of a customer base in his nativetongue.   Passover morning this past Saturday found him typically atthe office. Mr. Taver is not much for vacations or any othertime off. &quot;You work hard here, but it's all right,&quot; hethinks. Raya says the couple did manage a recent trip toHawaii, but after two days on the beach Norman was antsy andinsisted on driving about.   Indeed, he admits to realizing one other facet of hisfreedom. &quot;I became American not when I got my citizenship&quot;six years ago, he says. The milestone came shortlythereafter, when chest pains brought him to the hospital. &quot;Iask the doctor, `Is this heart attack?' `No -- this istypical American disease. It's called anxiety attack.'&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
