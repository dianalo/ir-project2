Early diagnosis and therapy is necessary to improve prognosis.This study was designed to assess the value of /sup 67/Ga scintigraphyin the primary detection and follow-up of these special pneumonias. /sup67/Ga scintigraphy was performed in 40 patients: 10 normal controls and30 HIV-positive patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC). /sup67/Ga scan results were compared with current chest radiographs and theresults of pathogen detection. The evaluation of positive scans was basedon a quantification of the pulmonary uptake, expressed as a pulmonary/soft-tissueuptake ratio. Only 8/30 patients had a normal scan, 22/30 showed diffuse(13/22) or focal (9/22) increases of pulmonary uptake. In 7/8 patientswith normal scans the chest radiograph was negative as well. The onepatient with negative scan but positive chest radiograph had pulmonaryKaposi's sarcoma. In 11/22 patients the /sup 67/Ga scan and chest radiographwere positive simultaneously. In the other 11/22 patients with positivescans chest radiographs were initially negative but showed pathologyin 5 cases within 1-2 weeks. The reason for positive scans in most caseswas an opportunistic lung infection; other forms of pneumonia were onlyobserved in two cases. The defined uptake ratio demonstrated to be ahighly sensitive parameter for monitoring pneumonia and the effects oftherapy in follow-up studies. In conclusion, quantitative /sup 67/Gascintigraphy proved to be a reliable and highly sensitive method forprimary detection and follow-up of opportunistic pneumonias in patientswith AIDS.</TEXT></DOC>
