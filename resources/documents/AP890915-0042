The Pentagon said Thursday it dropped Micronics International ofBrea, Calif., because of years of problems with an arming and safetydevice on air-to-air missiles.   The Pentagon withdrew its inspectors from the Micronics plantnear Los Angeles and the government no longer will accept deliveryof the safety and arming device, said Lt. Robert Fallon, a spokesmanfor the Navy.   ``There's no evidence that the safety and arming device hascaused any detrimental missile performance,'' the Navy said in astatement. ``The Navy has a full inventory of missiles for itsoperational forces to compensate for an expected stop in deliveriesof the safety and arming device.''   The devices will be produced by Raymond Engineering inMassachusetts, starting in 1991.   The missile itself is built by the Hughes Aircraft unit ofGeneral Motors Corp.   The troubled device will cause problems with the Amraam, Sparrowand Sidewinder missiles, The New York Times reported in today'seditions. The Amraam will not be installed aboard Navy F-15 and AirForce F-18 fighters until new parts are secured from another source,but production problems for the Sparrow and Sidewinder are expectedto be relatively minor.   The arming device, roughly comparable to the safety on a gun, isbuilt into the missile's fuze to prevent premature firing of themissile. It also prevents explosions in accidents, such as droppinga warhead on a carrier deck, but allows the warhead to explode whenit hits a target after being fired.   Limited production of the Phoenix missile began eight years ago,but as late as three years ago the Navy disclosed it was notdeploying the weapon because of several problems, including thearming device. In a ``tear-down'' inspection of the missile inmid-1986, the Navy found 2,694 defects.   Last year, the Los Angeles Times reported the Defense Departmentwas conducting a criminal investigation of Micronics, which wassuspected of using a production process that does not yield thequality required by specifications for the arming device.   The radar-guided Phoenix was designed for the F-14 fighter and issupposed to be able to hit targets 100 miles away.</TEXT></DOC>
