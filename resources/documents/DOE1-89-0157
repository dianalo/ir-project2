In HMPA neither Ln{sup 2+} nor An{sup 2+} are observedto transfer into the KBr solid phase, while in THF both Ln{sup 2+} andAn{sup 2+} cocrystallize with NaCl. The change in the behavior on Ln{sup2+} and An{sup 2+} cocrystallize with a change from one solvent to anotheris caused by the difference in the effective ionic radii of these elements,which arises from the large nephelauxetic effect for An{sup 2+} as wellas by the different solvating power of these solvents.</TEXT></DOC>
