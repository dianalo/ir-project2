Both Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the 151-nationInternational Monetary Fund, and Barber Conable, president of theother global lending organization, the World Bank, said theyrecognized the need for urgency in addressing the debt crisis.   Conable said that any delay ``could be devastating in view ofthe expectancies which have been created'' about the prospect for areduction in the $1.3 trillion level of Third World debt.   In a speech to the final session of the spring meetings of theIMF and the World Bank, Conable said the bank had created a jointtask force to work with the IMF to speed implementation of the newdebt relief program.   Earlier, the top policy board of the IMF issued a communiqueendorsing the general principles embodied in the debt programunveiled by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady on March 10.   The approval was seen as critical since the administration iscounting on most of the financing for the debt relief scheme tocome from the two lending agencies. The Brady plan seeks to resolvethe debt crisis by encouraging commercial banks to cancelvoluntarily a portion of the loans they have made to Third Worldcountries in return for assurances from the IMF and World Bank ofrepayment on the remaining debt.   The administration projects cutting the debt of 39 major debtornations by 20 percent over the next three years with financing ofabout $12 billion each from the IMF and the World Bank.   IMF and World Bank officials refused to discuss specific dollaramounts on Tuesday, saying that much will depend on how manycountries adopt the economic reforms which will be necessary toqualify for the debt relief.   A U.S. Treasury Department official, who spoke on condition thathis name not be used, said it was likely that the Philippines wouldbe the first country to qualify for debt relief. Mexico andVenezuela also have been mentioned as early candidates forassistance.   Camdessus told reporters at a briefing that the IMF recognizedthe need to move quickly to spell out just how the debt relief willwork in order to remove uncertainty in on-going negotiationsbetween debtor countries and creditors.   ``Nothing is worse than uncertainty,'' he said. ``The sooner wecan assemble a program and provide answers, the better the chancefor success.''   One reason for urgency is the growing political turmoil in manyemerging democracies in Latin America stemming from the debt burdenand the stagnation in living standards in the region. Riots left atleast 270 dead in Venezuela in February after the governmentimposed new debt austerity measures.   The spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank had beenconsidered a critical launching pad for the new Brady plan. Bradylaid the groundwork for approval by gaining the endorsement of theleading industrial countries for the debt relief strategy at adaylong negotiating session on Sunday.   The statement by the IMF interim committee contained much of thesame language as the Sunday communique issued by the United States,Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy.   In another favorable development this week, Japan pledged toloan up to $4.5 billion to developing nations over the next severalyears, a commitment that is viewed as critical since the flow ofcommercial bank lending has been drying up.   The administration did not get everything it sought. The IMFsteering group, because of objections from the British inparticular, refused to endorse a U.S. proposal to use IMF and WorldBank funds to guarantee interest payments on the debt as well asthe reduced amounts of principal.   The British and some other countries had objected that the morecostly interest-rate guarantees represented little more than abailout to commercial banks who had made the loans.   The IMF steering group promised to ``examine'' the question ofinterest rate subsidies. Dutch Finance Minister H. Onno Ruding,chairman of the IMF steering committee, said that the language ofthe final statement did not mean the idea was dead, only that thefinance ministers needed to know more details of how suchguarantees would work.   Brady, in a speech prepared for the closing session of the jointIMF-World Bank development committee, said the administration wouldcontinue pushing for guarantees on both the reduced debt and theinterest payments.   ``We believe it is essential to establish both supportmechanisms in order to provide adequate impetus'' for the banks tocancel a portion of the debt, Brady said.   French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy told reporters that theVenezuelan riots had been an ``alarm signal'' showing more neededto be done to address the 7-year-old debt crisis. He predicted thedebt issue would be a prime topic on the agenda when President Bushattends his first economic summit in Paris in July.</TEXT></DOC>
