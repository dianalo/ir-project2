Sease </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX </IN><TEXT>   For years, K mart customers have rushed to &quot;blue light specials,&quot; where the price of a product is sharply reduced for only a few minutes.    The flood of foreign takeover attempts in the U.S. these past few weeks is closely akin to a blue light special. The products -- U.S. companies -- are cheap, but the sale might not last very long.    For foreign companies, the U.S. is a big bargain basement, full of interesting companies, prices knocked low by last October's stock market crash and the anemic U.S. dollar. By some measures, those two factors combined have made U.S. companies more than 50% cheaper for foreign buyers than they were last summer.    What's more, as global competition heats up, it's becoming clearer that big industrial concerns must have a large presence in the U.S., the world's biggest and most lucrative single market. That explains why Britain's Beazer PLC is offering $1.27 billion for Koppers, Italy's Pirelli Group wants to buy Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber for $1.86 billion, topping an offer from Japan's Bridgestone, and Canada's Campeau is bidding $6.02 billion for Federated Department Stores.    There is another reason that the flurry of activity is occurring now and will probably increase over the next few months: Foreigners are frightened that their wholesale purchases of U.S. companies, and the concurrent building of new, foreign-owned factories in the U.S., is going to touch a raw political nerve. If that happens, they're afraid the blue light specials will come to a screeching halt.    The increasing presence of foreign companies in the U.S. already has created some ill will. A recent survey conducted for the Washington economic and political consulting firm of Smick-Medley Associates Inc. shows that the public &quot;is restless and suspicious&quot; about foreign investment in the U.S. and that 78% of those polled &quot;favor a law to limit the extent of foreign investment in American business and real estate.&quot;    And the issue is gaining momentum. A recent book entitled &quot;Buying Into America&quot; argues that nothing less than the nation's ability to control its own fate is at stake as a result of the influx of foreign investment into the U.S. Investment banker Felix Rohatyn has suggested that the U.S. might consider some type of controls on foreign investment. Senate hearings are scheduled on the subject later this month. And the trade bill now before Congress would allow the president to block new foreign investments in the U.S. that might threaten national security.    All of which sends a powerful signal to foreign companies: Act now, because the window of opportunity may soon close.    &quot;Foreigners will have to assume that U.S. companies will begin cloaking themselves in the mantle of national security&quot; to at least delay, if not foil, foreign takeovers, said Susan Lynner, vice president of Prudential-Bache Research in Washington. &quot;Beyond that, even after the trade bill is completed there will continue to be more hearings and more proposed legislation on the subject. How nervous that makes foreign investors, we'll have to see.&quot;    The current rush by foreign companies to buy U.S. firms holds a certain irony for U.S. investors, who have been waiting for foreign funds to flow back into the U.S. stock and bond markets, presumably driving down interest rates and bolstering stock prices. Investment advisers suggest that they may have to wait quite a while.    &quot;I don't think you're going to see much of a flow back into the stock market,&quot; said Peter Cooke, executive vice president of Pierson Capital Management, a Philadelphia-based money management firm that is a subsidiary of Pierson Heldring Pierson, a Dutch merchant bank.    The reason is the same weak dollar that makes the acquisition of U.S. companies so cheap. After having their U.S. stock and bond holdings devalued by the falling dollar and the stock market crash, foreign investors aren't likely to return to stocks and bonds in a big way until they are certain the dollar has stabilized.    &quot;It's a matter of control,&quot; Mr. Cooke said. &quot;For companies that are buying U.S. companies to run, the lower the dollar, the better,&quot; he said. But &quot;the dollar has been a huge, huge problem for passive institutional investors, who are subject to the whims of outside influences over which they have absolutely no control.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Stocks rebounded into positive territory late Friday after trading lower most of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 2034.98, up 8.95. Advancing issues were ahead of losers on the New York Stock Exchange, 856 to 676.    Big Board volume rose to 200 million shares from 197.3 million Thursday. The start of trading in newly issued shares of MFS Intermediate Income Trust boosted Friday's volume by 26 million shares.    Federated Department Stores rose 1 1/4 to 66. The Wall Street Journal's &quot;Heard on the Street&quot; column said most arbitragers probably will tender their shares of Federated to Campeau instead of R.H. Macy because of the structure and timing of the Campeau offer.    Koppers gained 3/8 to 51 5/8. The company filed suit in federal court in Pittburgh charging that Beazer PLC and Shearson Lehman Hutton violated federal securities laws in bidding for Koppers. Koppers asked the court to prohibit the Beazer Group from acquiring Koppers stock or making a tender offer to Koppers shareholders without adequate disclosure.    Analysts gave Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing a boost. The stock gained 1 1/2 to 59 1/8 after the company told analysts that business in the first quarter is stronger across the board than it was in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, analysts at Mabon Nugent and Wertheim Schroeder raised their first-quarter earnings estimates.    Eaton Corp. was also up sharply, for the fourth day in a row, on an analyst's recommendation. Eaton closed at 79 3/8, up 2 1/2, after Shearson Lehman Hutton put the stock on its recommended list and raised its evaluation of the stock for the second time in a week.    Union Pacific climbed 3 to 64 1/2 as rumors once again cropped up that it might sell off oil-producing properties. Possible buyers were said to be Amoco, Mobil or British Petroleum.    Among blue chips, General Motors was up 1 1/2 to 71 3/4; Allied-Signal gained 1 1/4 to 33; Du Pont rose 1 1/2 to 85 3/4; United Technologies closed up 1 at 39 7/8; International Business Machines climbed 1 3/4 to 115 1/2, and McDonald's lost 1 to 45 1/2. </TEXT></DOC>
