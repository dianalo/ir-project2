The lawsuit, filed in U.S. district court Tuesday againstseveral federal agencies, claims that they are allowing the illegalslaughter of hundreds of thousands of dolphins by failing toenforce the act.   The suit also asks that the Commerce Department be compelled toenforce requirements that the U.S. tuna industry use the bestequipment and safety measures to minimize the killing of dolphins.   ``Each year tens to hundreds of thousands of dolphins _ whichunlike tuna are expressly protected by federal law _ are brutallyand needlessly killed and their battered and torn bodies discardedinto the sea,'' said the lawsuit by the Earth Island Institute, theMarine Mammal Fund and Berkeley environmentalist David R. Brower.   Many dolphins die during tunafishing operations because theytend to congregate above the schools of tuna, and nets trap bothtuna and dolphins.   Named in the suit, in addition to Commerce, are the TreasuryDepartment, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration andthe National Marine Fisheries Service.   In Washington, NOAA spokesman Brian Gorman called the lawsuit``specious'' because ``it makes it sound as if we're ignoring someregulations that haven't gone into effect yet.''   He said NOAA, which is part of the Commerce Department,published regulations last month that go into effect next Monday toforce foreign tuna fleets to adhere to the same limits as Americanfleets or run the risk of having their tuna haul embargoed.   The U.S. fishing industry has an overall dolphin kill limit of20,500 a year, and has abided by that limit, Gorman said. Foreignfleets selling tuna in the United States are supposed to abide by acomparable limit, but Gorman acknowledged some countries haveignored the quota.   According to the Marine Fisheries Service, 125,000 dolphins orporpoises were killed annually by commercial fishermen between 1983and 1987, most of them by foreign fleets. Two years ago, U.S.fleets reached their quota in October and were ordered to suspendfishing for the rest of the year.   The 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act proclaimed an ``immediategoal that the incidental kill or incidental serious injury ofmarine mammals permitted in the course of commercial fishingoperations be reduced to insignificant levels approaching a zeromortality and serious injury rate.''   To achieve that goal, Congress granted the Secretary of Commercethe power to enforce the regulations of the act.   Dolphin kills are associated with yellowfin tuna fishing in theeastern tropical Pacific Ocean, a 3,000-mile wide area thatstretches from Southern California to Chile.   The tuna swim beneath schools of dolphins that glide near thewater's surface. Tuna boats encircle the schools with giant purseseine nets that trap both the dolphins and the tuna.   As many dolphins as possible are supposed to be released, butsome inevitably die or are injured, ``their beaks and flippersbroken or ripped from their bodies when they become entangled inthe nets,'' the suit said.</TEXT></DOC>
