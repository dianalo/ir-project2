The maker of the popular 70-year-old ice cream bars thisfall will launch fat-free ice cream sandwiches made withMonsanto Co.'s Simplesse, the first licensed product usingthe fat substitute to reach the market.</LP><TEXT>   Fat Freedom Eskimo Pie Sandwich is to be introduced in sixMidwestern states by October and nationally by next year. Theonly other product containing the fake fat is Monsanto'sSimple Pleasures frozen dairy dessert.   Food industry analysts said the move should help bolsterSimplesse, which hasn't taken off as quickly as some hadexpected when the Food and Drug Administration approved thefat substitute earlier this year. &quot;Its performance has beenmixed at best,&quot; said John McMillin, a food-industry analystat Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Monsanto has split its efforts with Simplesse betweendeveloping its own frozen dessert and licensing the fatsubstitute to other food companies. One market that Monsantowants to control is so-called hard-pack ice cream, where itsSimple Pleasures frozen dessert competes. It won't licenseSimplesse for use in other bulk frozen desserts.   In some cases, Monsanto is willing to sell exclusiverights to Simplesse. For instance, Philip Morris Cos.' KraftGeneral Foods unit has purchased exclusive rights for use ofSimplesse in the mayonnaise category, once the FDA grantsapproval for that use.   This month, the FDA accepted Monsanto's second filingseeking approval to use Simplesse in mayonnaise, saladdressings and other products.   For Eskimo Pie, a subsidiary of Reynolds Metals Co.,Richmond, Va., the agreement with Monsanto should be a boon.David Clark, Eskimo Pie president, predicted that sandwichsales will quickly top sales of its sugar-free sandwich,which accounts for 15% of Eskimo Pie's $70 million in annualsales. &quot;It's a golden opportunity for us,&quot; he said.   Each Fat Freedom sandwich contains no fat and 130calories, compared with six grams of fat and 180 calories ina typical ice cream sandwich, according to Eskimo Pieofficials.   Eskimo Pie has tried to develop its own fat-free product,but the product made with Simplesse tasted better: &quot;Consumersare demanding reduced fat foods, but they are unwilling tosacrifice taste,&quot; Mr. Clark said.   Eskimo Pie's sandwich will soon face competition, though,because Monsanto said it is negotiating with several othermakers of ice cream novelty products. Company officials won'tdisclose terms of their pact with Eskimo Pie or name theother companies that are interested in using the fatsubstitute.   Moreover, the frozen dessert market has been crowded inrecent years as food companies from H.J. Heinz Co. to KraftGeneral Foods launched low-calorie products.   Food analysts said Monsanto should emphasize licensing thefake fat rather than focusing on its own product development.&quot;It could give them the position as a core ingredient for theentire industry,&quot; said David Braff, president of Braff andamp; Co.,a New York marketing and product consulting firm. He expectsMonsanto will eventually license Simplesse to other hardpackice cream makers instead of focusing only on SimplePleasures.   &quot;The taste {of Simple Pleasures} isn't winning atremendous amount of support,&quot; said Mr. McMillin. &quot;Whenpeople want to eat ice cream, they want ice cream. You can'tcall this ice cream.&quot;   And marketing Simplesse and Simple Pleasures is achallenge because they are new products that are unfamiliarto consumers. Fake fat is &quot;a hard issue to market,&quot; Mr.McMillin said.   But Monsanto officials maintain that sales of the frozendessert have been better than expected. The Chicago areaplant that produces the dessert had to double its capacity tokeep up with demand.   And its advertising campaigns, which began in June andJuly, have increased sales, company officials said. &quot;Consumerreaction has been outstanding,&quot; said David Morley, presidentof Simplesse Co., a subsidiary of Monsanto Co.'s NutraSweetunit.</TEXT></DOC>
