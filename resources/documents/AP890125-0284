Ruder told the Senate Finance Committee that managers involved insome recent takeovers have avoided SEC regulations requiring them todisclose their own interest in the surviving company in third-partytakeovers because they are not a direct participant.   ``They may have an implied promise by the takeover or financialpeople that technically falls outside the transaction,'' Ruder said.``Technically our rules now don't require them to disclose that.''   He said those assurances to managers usually take the form of``We will not promise you equity participation (in the new company)but in our 45 previous transactions we always have.''   Ruder said the commission is now looking at revising itsregulations on management disclosures to require them in allnegotiated transactions. But he said that no new legislation isneeded to do it.   ``We have sufficiently broad rulemaking powers,'' he said.   Ruder was the second witness in two days of hearings by theFinance Committee into the mushrooming of junk-bond-financedleveraged buyout attempts, some of them launched by managers ofexisiting companies, in the past year.   After RJR Nabisco's managers tried to buy up all the publiclyowned stock last November in a leveraged buyout only to be outbidwith a 30 percent higher $25 billion offer from Kohlberg KravisRoberts andamp; Co., there have been concerns about whether managements insuch takeovers are acting in the best interests of stock and bondholders.   Ruder said that as long as there is an auction process,shareholders ususally end up maximizing their gain. But he expressedconcern they may not be getting the maximum value in deals where acompany's publicly held stock is purchased in buybacks without aneffective bidding process.   Testifying Tuesday before the same committee, Treasury SecretaryNicholas F. Brady estimated the cost of leveraged buyouts, or LBOs,and takeover defenses at $60 billion in 1988 alone.   While many restructured companies find themselves in troublebecause they cannot make the interest payments on their new debt,the investment banks, arbitrageurs, underwriters and LBO managersinvolved in the deals collect hundreds of millions of dollars inup-front fees, he complained.   ``Sadly, these same parties may have relatively little, if any,investment in the long-term success of the new enterprise,'' hesaid. ``Given this arrangement, it may very well be that the neteffect of LBOs is a financial snipe hunt, where the new long-terminvestors, flashlight in hand, are left holding the bag.''   Brady's testimony on the wave of leveraged buyouts was thestrongest indication yet that the new administration wants the trendreversed.   The Treasury secretary said he would prefer that ``the gladiatorsin the arena'' _ the investment bankers, corporate and insuranceexecutives and pension fund managers who trade in high-interest,high-risk junk bonds _ address the problem on their own. But hecoupled that with a warning.   ``It is the finest tradition of our democratic system thatgovernment look first to the people themselves for solutions andonly act _ but do act _ when it is clear the people cannot solve theproblem themselves,'' he said.   However, how far the government should go in restraining buyoutsis wide open to debate.   The most widely discussed option is not allowing companies todeduct as an expense the high rates of interest they pay on junkbonds _ a move that both Brady and Federal Reserve Chairman AlanGreenspan attempted to discourage Tuesday while acknowledging it mayhappen anyway.   Greenspan told the House Banking Committee on Tuesday thatattempting to tax the interest on junk bonds would probably beineffective because corporate lawyers would find some other way oftax-free debt financing.   Brady agreed. ``The long history of attempts to define problemsout of existence has proved that the definees are more adept thenthe definers,'' he said. ``Just as soon as the new regulations arewritten, efforts are under way to render them irrelevant.''   Like Greenspan, Brady said he would prefer that Congress reducethe tax on dividends to encourage more equity financing ofcorporations. But both men acknowledged that is unlikely because ofthe budget deficit.   When the Reagan administration in 1985 proposed giving companiesa tax credit for the dividends they pay, the annual cost to theTreasury in lost tax dollars was put at $7 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
