The new oat bran product, dubbed oatrim, has been usedexperimentally to make an ice cream-like dessert and can beused in a variety of room-temperature and low-temperaturefoods, including yogurt, bread, cookie icing, salad dressing,sour cream and mayonnaise, an Agriculture Departmentscientist told a meeting of the American Chemical Societyhere.</LP><TEXT>   The Agriculture Department is discussing pilot-plantproduction of the product with two unnamed food processors,George E. Inglett, a chemist with the Agricultural ResearchService laboratory in Peoria, Ill., said at a newsconference. Oatrim is being patented by the AgricultureDepartment.   At the same meeting, other researchers, including themanager of new product research for Miller Brewing Co.,Milwaukee, put in a strong plug for barley bran and barleybyproducts of brewing as being comparable to oat bran inlowering blood cholesterol levels.   A recently published study indicating that oat bran doeslittle to lower cholesterol levels came under fire fromseveral researchers at the conference, including RosemaryNewman, professor of foods and nutrition at Montana StateUniversity. They said the study, by researchers at Boston'sBrigham andamp; Women's Hospital, involved only volunteers with lowor normal cholesterol levels, where the effect of oat branisn't so pronounced as in people with high cholesterollevels. The Boston researchers acknowledged that people withhigh cholesterol may benefit more from high-fiber diets thandid the participants in their study.   The market for fat substitutes could be huge. Oatrim can'tbe used in foods that are cooked, so it would compete mostdirectly with Simplesse, a fat substitute from Monsanto Co.'sNutraSweet subsidiary that also breaks down at hightemperatures. Simplesse already is used in an ice cream-likedessert, Simple Pleasures, that NutraSweet is introducingnow. Kraft General Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., isawaiting regulatory approval for a similar fat substitutethat also can't be used in cooked foods. Olestra, a Procter andamp;Gamble Co. fat substitute awaiting regulatory approval, doeshold up at high temperatures.   Oatrim is made by treating oat bran with enzymes toproduce a white, tasteless flour or a powder that is rich incompounds known as beta-glucans, the portion of oat branbelieved responsible for lowering blood cholesterol levels,Mr. Inglett said. When heated and then allowed to cool, thepowder changes to a gel that can give foods a creamy texturesimilar to that produced by saturated fats, the chemist said.   Mr. Inglett said four ounces of an ice cream-like dessertmade with oatrim contained almost no fat, only fourmilligrams of cholesterol and only 135 calories. In fourounces of premium ice cream, there are 18 to 22 grams of fat,85 milligrams of cholesterol and 250 to 300 calories. A tastepanel judged the oatrim dessert only slightly less sweet thanthe ice cream and somewhat less creamy tasting, he reported.   Although the product's effects on cholesterol levelshaven't yet been tested on humans, tests on newly hatchedchicks at Montana State University showed that oatrim loweredcholesterol levels by almost 18%, with sharp reductions inthe LDL form of cholesterol, the &quot;bad&quot; type of cholesterol,and moderate increases in the HDL form of cholesterol, theform thought to provide some protection against heartdisease, according to the university's Ms. Newman.   Mr. Inglett said 30 grams of oatrim added to an instantbreakfast drink contain about 2.5 grams of beta-glucans,comparable to eating 100 grams of regular oat bran.   Ms. Newman said she was &quot;excited&quot; about the oatrimproduct, but she also reported animal and human tests showingthat barley is rich in beta-glucans and hascholesterol-lowering properties comparable to oats. Anexperiment with 22 volunteers showed both barley and oats,added to foods as flours, reduced blood cholesterol levels by14%.   Miller Brewing's new product research manager, Frank E.Weber, said the Philip Morris unit now is pushing the use of&quot;brewer's grain&quot; as a cholesterol-lowering food additive.Brewer's grain is a byproduct of the barley used in brewing,and he said Miller produces about 200 million pounds of it ayear. Much of it has been sold traditionally for about 40cents a pound for adding to animal feeds.   New research, Mr. Weber said, shows that brewer's grain isrich in tocotrienol, a chemical cousin to vitamin E.Experiments show that 30 milligrams a day of tocotrienol,about the amount contained in three tablespoons of brewer'sgrain, can lower blood cholesterol levels by 15% in threeweeks. Miller, he said, has recently begun selling brewer'sgrain to food processors for use in products such ashigh-fiber breads.</TEXT></DOC>
