(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Working at a hospital emergencyroom in 1975, Dr. Robert Gordon sensed a business opportunity amidthe bad backs and twisted ankles he saw each day.   ``The vast majority of cases didn't need to be seen in ahospital. These were the people with cuts and bruises who werewaiting for hours,'' said the lanky practitioner. ``It seemed asthough something else would work better.''   Gordon's notion was simple: A private clinic where people couldwalk in without an appointment, see a doctor without a long waitand walk out without a big bill.   Fourteen years after Gordon started what is considered the firstwalk-in clinic on a North Providence shopping strip, his idea hasbeen copied by giant health corporations, big-city medical centers,community hospitals and individual doctors.   Along the way, it has helped change the way many doctors workand become one of the most visible examples of a quiettransformation in American medicine _ the subtle evolution ofhealth care from a calling to a business.   The mythical, almost saintly family doctor, the kindly dispenserof compassion and prescriptions, is being replaced by 9-to-5employees of large health enterprises and by entrepreneurs whogenerate income by ordering tests on their diagnostic machines andby selling drugs they prescribe.   ``Everywhere you look, you see for-profit corporations providinghealth care. In this climate, doctors start considering themselvesbusinessmen because they are treated as businessmen,'' said Dr.Arnold Relman, editor of the New England Journal of Medicine andperhaps the nation's most vocal critic of corporate medicine.   Although by no means the only symptom of medicine as business,the walk-ins have been a lightning rod for those who pine for areturn to medicine as they remember it. They criticize thesebusinesses for their in-and-out, no-hand-holding brand of treatmentand for what they sense is an unseemly concern for the bottom line.   ``One of our tenets is continuity of care; the same doctorseeing the same patient over time is much more efficient andeffective,'' said Dr. Jim Jones, president of the American Academyof Family Physicians. At walk-in clinics ``that principle is beingviolated.''   While they have invited unflattering comparisons with hamburgerchains and muffler franchises _ they are often calleddoc-in-the-boxes _ these clinics have changed the way doctors work.   Many private practitioners now keep longer hours and hang outsigns offering walk-in service to attract new patients and keep oldones. Hospitals have opened quick-care annexes to their emergencywards and put their own store-front clinics downtown to serve asmagnets to attract patients to fill their empty beds.   At least 4,000 walk-in clinics operate nationwide. Last year, 50million patients paid them $2.5 billion to sooth minor aches andills. Their financial success, however, has been less thanstunning. Many who got into the enterprise learned that fastmedicine, like fast food, needs high volume to survive, and theresimply were not enough broken arms and bruised noggins to go around.   Most analysts agree clinics must see 30 to 40 patients a day,seven days a week, to stay out of the red.   ``The people who use these services don't necessarily come backbecause they aren't the sorts who want a regular sort ofmedicine,'' said Regina Herzlinger, a Harvard Business Schoolprofessor and an expert on the business of health care.   ``To make the practice viable, you had to always bring in newrecruits, and that's a very expensive way of doing any business,''she said.   Gordon and his early imitators initially billed themselves asemergency or urgent care centers to emphasize their similarity tothe emergency room, but hospital administrators and doctors inprivate practice complained that people with heart attacks orserious injuries might mistake these shops for true emergency rooms_ and die for their error.   The early walk-in clinics were also viewed as money machines.   ``Business people fell in love with the idea without realizingthe problems,'' said Chicago surgeon Bruce Flashner, who opened oneclinic after another starting in 1979.   Humana Inc., the hospital chain, bought Flashner's 20 units for$17 million in 1985 and eventually operated 150 MedFirst clinicsaround the country.   For most of the major franchise operators, however, the bubbleburst.   Owners found they couldn't pull in enough patients and money tocover the startup costs of $300,000 to $500,000 and high salariesfor doctors and nurses. Many clinics folded or were sold. Humanaclosed or sold off its entire clinic operation, writing off $40million.   Despite the shakeout, the industry continues to grow. Many ofthe newest outposts are operated by hospitals, which often viewthem more as marketing tools than money makers. And despite thecondescending attitude of many health professionals toward theseclinics, they have no trouble attracting doctors.   Most young physicians finish residency training with crushingdebts. They need jobs and cannot afford to buy establishedpractices or start new ones. However many, like Gordon, simplyprefer clinic medicine.   ``I don't like getting involved with patients,'' he said. ``Idon't like long, protracted following of cases, seeing people overthe years and making little adjustments in their medication. I liketo see them and send them along.''   Walk-ins are far cheaper than emergency rooms, but with basefees ranging from $30 to $50, they are often more expensive thantraditional office doctors.   Their success also depends on billing for more than the standardoffice visit fee.   ``You need other revenue generators, like X-rays and testing,''said Nancy Kane, an assistant professor of management at theHarvard School of Public Health who has studied the industry.   Some doctors who have worked for a number of walk-in clinicscomplain they are pressured or paid to do tests that may not benecessary, a claim clinic officials deny.   Health Stop, now the nation's largest chain with 112 units,encourages its doctors to think of the clinic as their privatepractice and to get patients to return for blood sugar checks, highblood pressure consultations and other standard care.   ``Sometimes I think we're re-inventing the private practice,''said Dr. Joseph Maloney, Health Stop's executive vice president.   Linda Douglas, a physician at an Oak Brook, Ill., Health Stopunit, has seen shifting philosophies as owners changed in her threeyears as a walk-in clinic doctor. Today she says some 80 percent ofthe people she sees are regular patients.   ``Initially, the gist of the thing was we just want to seepatients once,'' she recalled. ``Now you've got to have doctorsbuild a practice and if I don't deliver quality care to mypatients, they're not going to come back.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 23</NOTE></DOC>
