The 53-year-old education minister, who was sworn in today inPretoria as acting president, is known as an affable pragmatist whoseeks to avoid ideological labels.   He became leader of the governing National Party in February,narrowly defeating a Cabinet colleague in a parliamentary partycaucus.   ``Our goal is a new South Africa, a totally changed South Africa,'' he told Parliament at the time. ``White domination, insofar as itstill exists, must go.''   Later, de Klerk said: ``White security can never be built oninjustice toward others. Things will have to change drastically andquickly.''   After several years of black protests and increasing worldsanctions against South Africa during P.W. Botha's rule, many whitessaw de Klerk as representing a new and more conciliatory generationof National Party leaders.   They welcomed the vision of a nation in which, as he put it,``all reasonable people align themselves behind mutually acceptablegoals.''   Helen Suzman, who pioneered anti-apartheid views among Parliamentmembers, said of de Klerk: ``People are being too optimistic if theythink he is going to throw fundamental policy overboard, but I thinkhe's pragmatic and intelligent. He realizes that change isabsolutely inevitable.''   Black leaders said they suspect de Klerk will pursue largelycosmetic changes. Their suspicions were strengthened by his refusalto accept a one-man, one-vote system that would give power to theblack majority, and by the National Party's platform for generalelections Sept. 6.   The platform supports the idea of group social and politicalrights, which has helped preserve segregated neighborhoods andschools under the apartheid system of racial separation.   De Klerk practiced law before entering Parliament in 1973. Heheld several Cabinet posts beginning in 1978 and in 1982 took thepowerful job of National Party leader in the Transvaal, SouthAfrica's most populous and wealthiest province.   He is married, with three children and his wife, Marike, oncedescribed him as ``a charmer, with many broken hearts left afterhim.''   F.W., as he likes to be called, comes from a long line ofpoliticians beginning with his great-grandfather, a senator. Hisbrother Willem quit as editor of Rapport, the largestAfrikaans-language newspaper, after being criticized forincreasingly liberal views on race reform.   The brothers have differed over politics, but have said theynever let those differences affect their close family relationship.   South African analysts picture de Klerk as a centrist, carefulnot to alienate either conservatives or liberals in the NationalParty.   If, as expected, the party wins the Sept. 6 elections, de Klerkwill become president with the same task as Botha: To meet blackdemands for civil rights and still reassure the minority whitestheir way of life will not be destroyed.   Tom Sebina of the banned African National Congress guerrillamovement, said recently de Klerk and Botha ``are pieces of the samecarcass. If the meat is bad, the meat is bad.''</TEXT></DOC>
