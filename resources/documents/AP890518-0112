At least 100,000 students, townspeople and opposition supportersrallied in Kwangju to denounce Roh and the United States forsuppressing the uprising in the provincial capital that left 192dead.   They burned effigies representing Roh and other senior armygenerals. Protesters beat drums and chanted ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!''``Yankee go home!'' and ``Drive out the Yankee imperialists!''   Earlier Thursday, 20,000 people visited the cemetery outsideKwangju where many of those killed in the nine-day uprising areburied. Mourners prayed and bowed before the graves as funeralmusic played over loudspeakers and students beat drums.   In Seoul and nine other cities, thousands joined marches,protests and religious services. About 40,000 students turned outfor rallies at 87 campuses nationwide, news reports said.   ``Roh Tae-woo must step down for suppressing Kwangju and alldemocratic movements,'' dissident leader Oh Chung-il told thecheering crowd in Kwangju, 170 miles southwest of Seoul.   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said in a message read tocheering crowds that right-wing forces were plotting to imposeauthoritarian rule in South Korea again.   ``We must remain alert to crush them and inherit the spirit ofKwangju,'' Kim said in the message.   Most protests were peaceful, but radical students in southernChonju hurled firebombs at a government party office and clashedwith riot police who tried to disperse about 2,000 marchers,according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. About 20 peoplewere injured, Yonhap said.   In Seoul, thousands of riot police stood by to block protestsand chased bands of students who ran through the streets shoutinganti-government slogans. But there were no reports of injuries.   Past anniversaries of the Kwangju uprising were marked byviolent protests, but dissident leaders called for peacefuldemonstrations this time.   It was the first time the government had permitted ademonstration in Kwangju to mark the May 18 uprising.   At the cemetery, protesters burned an effigy representing Roh,former President Chun Doo-hwan and the United States. The6-foot-high figure of a man was capped with a cardboard top hatdecorated with the American flag.   Dissident groups called for Roh's resignation and the expulsionof the 43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea. They say Washingtonhas helped to keep Roh and past authoritarian governments in power.   They also charge the United States failed to prevent the bloodysuppression of the uprising and is morally responsible.   Crowds hiked to the cemetery in the hills outside Kwangju.Elderly mothers, dressed in long traditional white mourning robes,sobbed and cried hysterically before the graves of sons killed inthe uprising.   ``My son, my son!'' sobbed one woman.   Other mourners placed fruit or drinks on the graves and burnedscented candles to honor the dead.   Columns of radical students carried red, blue and yellow flagsand chanted slogans.   Roh was a senior general when townspeople and students seized agovernment armory in Kwangju on May 18, 1980, and took control ofthe city. Troops were sent in to put down the uprising afternegotiations failed.   Government reports said 192 people were killed and hundredsinjured. But opposition groups claim hundreds more were killed.   Anti-government sentiment in Kwangju, a traditional oppositionstronghold, has been inflamed by the death of a radical studentearlier this month. Dissidents alleged that police killed LeeChol-kyu, whose body was found in a reservoir outside Kwangju May10.   South Korea has been hit by violent anti-government protests andlabor strikes in recent months. Dissidents and radical studentshave called for the overthrow of the Roh government, but they lackpublic support because of their violent tactics.</TEXT></DOC>
