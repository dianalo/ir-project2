Eleven strikes continued at mines, ports, shipyards andfactories throughout Poland, but there were no reports of policeattempts to dislodge the striking workers.   The Communist Party's 230-member Central Committee met onSaturday and several delegates lambasted the government's handlingof Poland's dire economic problems and the labor unrest.   Messner, prime minister since 1985, acknowledged the criticismin a speech in which he reviewed his government's performance andstressed its plans to improve the economy, the state news agencyPAP said.   In opening remarks to the party meeting earlier, Gen. WojciechJaruzelski said that the communist government would undertake a``self-critical analysis'' of the problems behind the latest waveof strikes in Poland.   Messner, as head of the government, oversees the variousministries and is theoretically responsible for governmentperformance. But ultimate power rests with the Communist Party ledby Jaruzelski.   PAP said the party plenum would continue on Sunday.   On Saturday, the government was attacked by a series ofcommittee members as ineffectual. Some of the sharpest criticismcame from Politburo member Alfred Miodowicz, leader of the officialtrade union alliance OPZZ, which was set up after authoritiescrushed the Solidarity union in 1981.   ``Nothing can explain the sluggishness in solving variousproblems, the failure to make progress,'' Miodowicz said, accordingto PAP. ``Hence, the so-determined voices demanding personalaccountability.''   Aleksandra Koszada, a party member from a radio plant in Kutno,said, ``It is tragic that the conviction is becoming widespreadthat only strikes can prod our government into resolute action.   ``The government's ineptitude is responsible for many economicproblems and wasted years,'' added Bogdan Borys, a metalworker fromCzestochowa.   The attacks added strength to speculation that the plenum wouldlead to government changes, perhaps replacing Messner himself.   The meeting was held less than a day after the governmentoffered to begin talking with workers, possibly includingSolidarity leader Lech Walesa.   But speakers also railed against the strikes. ``They have ananarchy-generating, destructive character,'' said Politburo memberJozef Czyrek. ``They cannot be accepted.''   Jaruzelski denied that the party session was a direct result ofthe strikes. But he said the meeting would make a ``critical andself-critical analysis of the causes for the present tensions.''   Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak on Friday proposedunconditional talks with the striking workers.   ``I have been authorized to promptly hold a meeting withrepresentatives of various social and employee groups. I am notlaying down any preconditions either concerning the subject matterof the talks or ... the participants,'' Kiszczak said on nationaltelevision.   ``Excellent,'' said Adam Michnik, a senior Solidarity adviserreached in Gdansk after Kiszczak's speech. ``I believe this is thefirst serious step in the right direction.''   Striking workers at the Stalowa Wola steelworks in southeastPoland said they responded to the offer by empowering Walesa andthe Catholic bishops to negotiate their demand of legalizingSolidarity.   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban, asked Saturday in a telephoneinterview if Kiszczak's proposal would exclude Walesa, replied,``No.''   ``The proposal is directed at all who do not reject the existinglegal and constitutional order,'' he added.   Solidarity, the first independent union in the Soviet bloc, wascrushed during a wave of strikes in 1981, when marshal law wasdeclared. The union was outlawed in 1982.   Walesa, who founded Solidarity in 1980, said Friday he was readyto talk to authorities at any time without any preconditions.   Workers at the striking 30 Years of People's Poland mine in thesouthern city of Jastrzebie voluntarily abandoned their occupationstrike at 7 p.m. Saturday because of a fire that started in thecoal mine before the strike began Aug. 19.   Urban earlier said authorities might deploy police at the minebecause of the underground fire. Until Saturday, striking minersremained inside the shaft, denying that the danger was critical.   Several dozen miners at the Moszczenica coal mine in Jastrzebiewho had barricaded themselves in an underground shaft emerged atnoon Saturday after talking to a priest, officials and activistssaid.   In recent days, the government has used a combination of limitedforce and propaganda against the strikers. Police have evicted somestriking miners in the coal-rich Silesia region, as well as sometransit workers from depots in the northwestern port of Szczecin.   Striking dockworkers in Szczecin said talks with managementbegun Saturday broke off without any results.   Jaruzelski said the Central Committee meeting would work out aprogram to improve people's living standards and market stability,as well as to end Poland's rising wage-price spiral.   ``In short, what is needed is a brave turn,'' he said at theplenum, parts of which were televised.   Politburo member Wladyslaw Baka, a reformer in charge ofeconomic poliy, said the Politburo had rejected a price freeze, butit plans other steps to curb 60 percent annual inflation andimprove erratic supplies to the marketplace.   A special Parliament commission on the economy is scheduledWednesday and the full Parliament is expected to meet shortlythereafter.</TEXT></DOC>
