The intravital-microscopy appliedto the subcutaneous microcirculatory system in a transparent round-tablechamber, that has been installed in advance into the ear lobe, revealedthat markedly increased intravascular adhesiveness of white blood cells(WBCs) and extensive stasis similar to the intravascular coagulationof red blood cells (RBCs) developed as immediate changes soon after the{gamma}-rays irradiation regardless of difference of exposure doses suchas 50, 250, 500 and 1000 R. Although these changes disappeared within3 - 4 weeks in animals exposed to 50 R, they persisted throughout thewhole experimental period of 4 weeks at higher doses of {gamma}-raysand the extent of the persisting changes appeared to be dose-dependent.Similarly the macrocirculatory changes such as decreases in measurementsof RBCs, WBCs, hematocrit values, hemoglobin concentrations, and plateletcounts and increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rates were also noticedin a dose-dependent manner.</TEXT></DOC>
