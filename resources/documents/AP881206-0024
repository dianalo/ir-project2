Congressional sources said that if there were such a compact _ asalleged by a former Israeli official _ the Reagan administrationnever told lawmakers about it. Reagan never signed any suchagreement, his spokesman said Monday.   The denials were prompted by a weekend news story which said sucha U.S.-Israeli agreement had been revealed by former Israeliofficial Amiram Nir.   In Jerusalem, the office of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres alsodenied the report in The Washington Post, saying, ``There is no suchagreement.'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel declined toelaborate.   Nir, a prominent figure in the Iran-Contra affair, said in Junethat a compact allowed such covert operations, which he said hesupervised with then-National Security Council aide Oliver L. North,the newspaper said.   The Post reported Nir's assertions in its Sunday editions, fourdays after the 37-year-old former Israeli counterterrorism officialwas killed in the crash of a light plane in Mexico.   North is charged with a variety of offenses including conspiracyand illegal diversion of millions of dollars in government money.The charges center on the Reagan administration's clandestine salesof U.S. arms to Iran in 1985-86 and subsequent diversion of proceedsto the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. North is scheduled to stand trialin late January.   Nir said in June the agreement authorized still-secret operationsthat he and North supervised in 1985-86, the Post said.   It said American and Israeli sources confirmed the existence ofthe Israeli-American agreement, referred to as ``terms ofreference'' or ``accords'' by some sources.   Sources at the House and Senate Intelligence committees saidMonday no such agreement had been reported to Congress.   ``It is a serious allegation that there exists an agreement toengage in covert actions that would not be reported to Congress,''said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity.   The law requires that any covert action be carried out only afterit is authorized in a ``finding'' signed by the president whichstates why the activity is in the national security interest. Suchfindings are supposed to be reported to congressional reviewcommittees on a timely basis.   Asked whether such an agreement existed, presidential spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater replied, ``The bottom line is that we don't believethere is one.''   He said White House officials checked with various agencies thatmight have been involved and could find no record of such anagreement.   Fitzwater said Reagan ``never executed any umbrella agreement oraccord such as the one described ... and we're not aware of theexistence of any document fitting that description.''   At the State Department, spokesman Charles E. Redman echoedFitzwater. ``We've done some more research, and I can say no suchagreement as discussed in that Post story exists, or existed,'' hesaid.   However, he said the United States shared information onterrorism with Israel.   ``We do know, and this may be, perhaps, at the root of thatstory, that Mr. Nir in his capacity in the Israeli government didpropose a more formal agreement, or memorandum of agreement in thetime period of September and October 1985,'' Redman said. ``But thatproposal was immediately rejected by the United States government.''</TEXT></DOC>
