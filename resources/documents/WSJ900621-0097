Fred Suttles Jr., president of Outdoor Media Inc., enteredthe guilty plea in federal court here and agreed to cooperatewith a continuing federal investigation of the affair.</LP><TEXT>   Outdoor Media, a Pensacola, Fla.-based outdoor advertisingfirm, rented billboard space to the Gulf Power Co. unit ofSouthern. According to court papers, Mr. Suttles directed hisemployees and several of his vendors to contribute $40,550 tomore than a dozen state and local political candidatesdesignated by Gulf; he then reimbursed the workers andvendors. The income-tax charge relates to his listing thosereimbursements as legitimate business expenses.   Court papers filed by the Internal Revenue Service saidMr. Suttles agreed to the scheme to get Gulf advertisingcontracts. The papers said Jacob F. &quot;Jake&quot; Horton, a formersenior vice president of Gulf, asked for the contributions.Mr. Horton was killed in April 1989 in a corporate planecrash, the cause of which has yet to be determined.   The scheme was intended to circumvent federal law, whichprohibits utility holding companies, such as Southern, frommaking political contributions.   Mr. Suttles, who couldn't be reached for comment, faces upto three years in prison and a $250,000 fine. His plea isn'tapt to affect Gulf Power, which itself pleaded guilty lastfall to two felonies -- conspiracy to make illegal politicalcontributions and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. of incometaxes. Gulf Power paid a $500,000 fine.   However, an IRS probe of individuals involved in thescheme continues, and further charges are anticipated, thosefamiliar with the investigation said.</TEXT></DOC>
