Daniel R. Smith, chairman, said that's up 9% from the year-earlier's $18.7 million, or $1.40 a share, on fewer shares outstanding, but at the low end of company and analyst expectations.    The results mean that First of America now expects its 1988 earnings to fall at the low end of its earlier projected range of $91 million, or $6.15 a share, to $93 million, or $6.30 a share, Mr. Smith said in an interview. In 1987, the bank holding company earned $78.3 million, or $5.62 a share.    Several factors held second-quarter earnings below expectations, Mr. Smith said. The company's merger of its four Detroit banks into one bank &quot;took a little longer than expected,&quot; he said. Although the move officially went into effect April 1, many of the details weren't worked out until later. He said that process has now been completed and &quot;we expect some very positive effects in the second half&quot; from the merger.    In addition, deposit growth year-to-date has been below expectations, running at 3% -- excluding the effects of acquisitions -- compared with a target of 5%, Mr. Smith said.    A big reason was the unexpected complexity of the Detroit merger that meant &quot;we weren't able to go into the Detroit market with the force we wanted to,&quot; he said. Another reason, he added, was &quot;cannibalization&quot; by some new products, which mainly drew deposits from old accounts, rather than adding business.    Per-share earnings were depressed by a higher-than-expected number of shares outstanding, largely because of acquisitions and also a dividend reinvestment program, Mr. Smith said.    Nevertheless, First of America still expects to reach its goals of attaining a return on assets of 1.05% by next year, and an 18% return on equity &quot;in a couple of years,&quot; he added.    Assets at the end of the second quarter were $9.01 billion -- the first time the company crossed the $9 billion mark -- compared with $8.4 billion as of June 30, 1987.    The company expects earnings next year will benefit substantially from consolidation of operations across its markets. So far, the savings have only covered the expense of the moves, begun late last year. But in 1989, the consolidation in Detroit, alone, is expected to add $6 million before taxes, or 23 cents a share, to the bottom line, Richard F. Chormann, president, said. For example, the company will eliminate 200 of the 1,750 jobs in the Detroit area, although it says it will do so through attrition and not layoffs. </TEXT></DOC>
