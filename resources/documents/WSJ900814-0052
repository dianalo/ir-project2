GM didn't disclose details of the settlement. Work couldresume at the Flint plant as soon as tomorrow, a GM spokesmansaid. However, that may not be soon enough to prevent furtherassembly plant shutdowns. It could take several days torestock the supplies of gas tanks and other parts made at theFlint factory.</LP><TEXT>   The Flint walkout, which began last Wednesday, wasostensibly over local grievances. But union officials andworkers at the AC Rochester division plant said the strike'sreal purpose was to show the UAW's determination to win broadjob protection for all 300,000 UAW-represented workers at GM.The UAW and GM are currently bargaining for a new nationalcontract. The old pact expires Sept. 14.   &quot;We want job security,&quot; said 46-year-old Roger Wagner, whohas worked at the plant since 1964. &quot;You wouldn't want towork for a place for 26 years and then have them close theplace down.&quot;   Mr. Wagner, who was at the local union hall to sign up forstrike benefits, said that when he went to work at the plant,he had more than 12,000 co-workers. Now, there are only 2,400people who actually work at the plant. Another 800 counted asfull-time workers are actually laid off, but are paid fullwages and benefits because GM gave their work to outsidecontractors. GM has said another 600 of Mr. Wagner'sco-workers could lose their jobs in 1992.   By taking the unusual step of sanctioning a local strikeduring national talks, UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich,head of the union's GM department, has sent a clear signal toGM, and restive rank-and-file members, that he is willing toput the fight for job security ahead of labor-managementcooperation. Mr. Yokich also has served notice that he isready to hobble GM with carefully targeted strikes if thecompany won't bend on job security issues.   The AC Rochester plant is a critical operation for GMbecause it is the sole supplier of gas tanks for 55% of theauto maker's U.S.-built cars, vans and trucks. By strikingthis single factory, the UAW forced GM to shut otheroperations employing about 11,550 people.   Last week, GM shut all or part of truck plants at Moraine,Ohio; Shreveport, La., and Pontiac, Mich. Yesterday, GM hadto stop the line at its Buick City plant in Flint, idling3,300 workers who build GM's successful Buick LeSabre and itssister car, the Olds 88 Royale. The Buick has the highestquality rating of any car built by the Big Three U.S. automakers, according to a survey by J.D. Power andamp; Associates, aCalifornia market research firm. Part of a truck plant inFlint also shut down.   In the wake of the strike, production could be haltedtoday at GM's assembly plant in Orion Township, Mich., whichbuilds the Cadillac DeVille and the Oldsmobile 98, a GMspokeswoman said.   The walkout could hurt GM's profit for the third quarter.The company had planned a sharp boost in vehicle productionfor the current quarter. &quot;It's too early to tell whether wecan make up the losses,&quot; the GM spokesman said.   Striking workers said a profit squeeze is exactly whatthey wanted. &quot;It's the only way you're going to getmanagement's attention,&quot; said striker Owen Jackson, who hasworked for GM in Flint for 40 years. &quot;The only time we'vegotten anything here is when we put our foot down and letthem know where we stand.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
