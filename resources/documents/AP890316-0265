However, some members of Congress have said the plan, favored byATandamp;T, could lead to price increases, particularly for consumers inrural areas.   The unanimous commission vote will replace ATandamp;T's so-calledrate-of-return regulations on July 1 with a plan that would tielong-distance prices to the rate of inflation.   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick described the commission action as``a major milestone'' in telephone regulation.   He said it was time to move on from the rate-of-return processestablished for the old Bell System in the 1960s. Under that system,ATandamp;T was allowed to make a set profit beyond its costs, whichPatrick says provided an incentive for padding costs.   ``We simply can no longer have a regulatory approach that wascrafted in the 1960s, to use that system in the 1990s and beyond. Itis simply outdated,'' he said.   Currently, ATandamp;T can earn about 12 percent above its expenses. Thenew plan willallow it to raise its rates for all customers to 3percent less than the rate of inflation. An additional 2 percentreduction would be allowed for residential and small business users.   For instance, if the inflation rate were 4 percent, ATandamp;T couldraise its long-distance rate 1 percent overall, but residential andsmall business users would get a 1 percent decrease at thatinflation rate.   Rates would be set on three categories of ATandamp;T service:residential and small business, 800 services, and all other businessservices. Within the residential-small business category, prices ofparticular services such as night and weekend calling could increaseno more than 1 percent a year.   Critics of the plan note that ATandamp;T's long-distance rates havedecreased 38 percent since divestiture in 1984 due to a reduction inservice costs. They say prices will not fall as quickly under thenew system as they would under the old one.   Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis said she supported ``this grandexperiment'' of price-cap regulation but had some concern,particularly over a provision that would limit how far ATandamp;T couldlower its long-distance rates.   Commissioner James Quello also said he was concerned about thatfeature and hoped it could be eliminated soon. But he described ratecaps as ``a precedent-setting issue that is really going to benefitthe public.''   Patrick said local telephone companies will not come under therate cap plan at this point, but that they would be included by July1, 1990. He said the commission was going to accept further publiccomment on that issue and asked the local companies to submit plansto use rate caps by May 17.   BellSouth, one of the seven regional companies created in the1984 breakup of ATandamp;T, said the commission ``took an important stepto benefit consumers in a substantial way'' with today's action, butit said savings would have been greater had the commission appliedthe new rules to local companies this year instead of in 1990.   Patrick said he thought he had calmed the waters in Congress overrate caps, where there has been great concern that residentialconsumers would not be well-protected, particularly rural telephoneusers.   Congressional concern over rate caps, which Patrick firstproposed in a speech more than two years ago, caused him to postponea vote on the plan in January.   Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., a member of the Housetelecommunications subcommittee, introduced legislation earlier thismonth to prevent implementation of price caps until Congress canstudy the proposal more thoroughly.   Cooper said he wanted explicit assurances in the plan thatuniervice in remote areas would be maintained and thast telephoneservice in remote areas would be maintained and that long-distancerates would not rise disproportionately in those remote areas.   Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., said at a hearing last month on theplan that the FCC should require ATandamp;T to share with customers halfof any windfall profits arising from the plan.   Patrick bowed to congressional pressure and put in limits on howlow rates could go. Without such floors, ATandamp;T might be able to lowerprices enough to drive out competition, the critics said.   The 3 percent rate cap would be imposed after adjustments forcost changes outside of ATandamp;T's control, such as the charges thatlocal phone companies require ATandamp;T to pay to connnect with the localphone networks.</TEXT></DOC>
