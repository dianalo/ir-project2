Ruling in a case from Canton, Ohio, the justices said cities andtowns may be held legally accountable if the inadequate trainingstemmed from governmental ``deliberate indifference.''   In an opinion by Justice Byron R. White, the court said theinadequate training also must be closely related to the ultimateinjury suffered before local governments can be forced to paydamages.   The ruling, although a potential threat to municipal treasuriesnationwide, might not result in numerous successful lawsuits.   White said the court was imposing a stringent standard for thosefiling such suits because any lesser standard would open localgovernments to ``unprecedented liability'' and saddle federal courtswith ``an endless exercise of second-guessing municipalemployee-training programs.''   Past Supreme Court decisions had made clear that a much-usedfederal civil rights law could not be used to sue a local governmentevery time one of its employees violated someone's rights. The courtpreviously had ruled that the local government is not liable unlessthe injury stemmed from some unconstitutional official policy.   But in today's ruling, the court for the first time ruled that alocal government's valid official policy can be challengedsuccessfully in court _ if the policy is subverted by inadequatetraining.   The decision is a setback, but not a final defeat, for Cantonofficials who sought to kill a lawsuit by a woman who says policeviolated her rights by failing to get needed medical attention forher after she was arrested for speeding.   Geraldine Harris sued Canton over an April 26, 1978, incident inwhich she was stopped for speeding while driving her teen-agedaughter to school.   Police said they placed Mrs. Harris into a patrol wagon after the52-year-old woman became uncontrollably upset and uncooperative.When she arrived at the police station, Mrs. Harris was lying on thewagon's floor.   She repeatedly slumped to the stationhouse floor during a stay of30 or 40 minutes but police officers did not call for medical help,saying they believed Mrs. Harris was merely excited and would calmdown if left alone and permitted to see her family.   When family members arrived, they arranged to have Mrs. Harristaken by ambulance to a hospital. There she was diagnosed assuffering from stress reaction, anxiety and depression.   She was hospitalized for a week, and received subsequentoutpatient treatment for the next year.   The Harris family sued the city in federal court, and a juryawarded Mrs. Harris $200,000 after deciding that she unreasonablyhad been denied medical attention by police.   The presiding judge told jurors that the city could be heldliable even if the official city policy was to seek medicalattention for those persons in custody who require it.   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, although ordering a newtrial in Mrs. Harris' case, ruled that Canton could be liable formonetary damages because its police officers were not trainedadequately to summon medical help in such cases.   Today's ruling returned Mrs. Harris' case to the 6th Circuitcourt, which can now order a new trial or dismiss the suit.   A second vote, to send the case back to the appeals court, was6-3. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M.Kennedy said Mrs. Harris' suit should be dismissed.   Applying the ``deliberate indifference'' test, O'Connor wrote forthe three, ``There is no evidence in the record indicating that thecity of Canton has been deliberately indifferent to theconstitutional rights of pretrial detainees.''   In the court's main opinion, White wrote, ``There are limitedcircumstances in which an allegation of a failure to train can bethe basis for liability'' under federal civil rights law.   ``Only where a municipality's failure to train its employees in arelevant respect evidences a deliberate indifference to the rightsof its inhabitants can such a shortcoming be properly thought of asa city policy or custom that is actionable,'' White added.   Merely negligent conduct by government policy makers andenforcers is not enough to hold the government accountable formonetary damages, White said.   In other action, the court:   _ Said railroads and airlines may penalize strikers by givingtheir jobs to employees with less seniority who stay on the job orreturn to work before the strike ends.   In a 6-3 ruling which was a victory for Trans World Airlines,Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said that such a policy ``of encouragingpre-strike workers to remain on the job during the strike or toabandon the strike and return to work before all vacancies werefilled'' is a legitimate ``exercise of TWA's peaceful economicpower.''   _ Made it easier for the U.S. government to turn over taxinformation to a foreign government.   The 9-0 ruling allows Canadian officials to see financial recordsof two Canadian citizens with bank accounts in Washington state.   _ Reinstated a convicted Florida murderer's death sentence,saying he should have been barred from mounting a successfulconstitutional attack in federal courts.   By a 5-4 vote, the court ruled that Aubrey Adams Jr., forfeitedhis right to challenge his sentence in federal court on grounds hefailed to raise in state court.   Adams was convicted of strangling an 8-year-old girl in Ocala 11years ago.   The city-liability case is Canton vs. Harris, 86-1088.</TEXT></DOC>
