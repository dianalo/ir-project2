SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The share of first pregnancies beginning out ofwedlock has risen sharply in the 1980s and single pregnant women areno longer rushing to the altar, a new Census Bureau study shows.   There has been a significant rise in the share of first birthsout of wedlock during the last two decades, while the share of womenwho tie the knot between conception and birth has been on a decline.   The census report also found a jump in the birth rate among womenin their 30s, noting that most women who had a baby in 1988 were inthe work force. It found that minorities tend to have higher birthrates than whites and that nearly three-quarters of recent births toblack women between 15 and 29 were out of wedlock.   Overall, the national fertility rate was 69.7 births per 1,000women age 18 to 44 during the year ending in June 1988, according tothe report, ``Fertility of American Women: June 1988.''   Fertility rates have remained at about 70 births per 1,000 womenduring this decade and the 69.7 for 1988 is not consideredsignificantly different from the 71 recorded the year before.   But the profile of women becoming mothers in the United Stateshas changed.   For women age 15 to 29, the bureau found, 40 percent of firstbirths were conceived out of marriage between 1985 and 1988.   That's up from just more than 30 percent when the measure wasfirst taken, between 1970 and 1974, the report said.   The major change occurred among women who gave birth out ofwedlock, a share which increased from 17.9 percent of first mothersin the early 1970s to 28.3 percent between 1985 and 1988.   At the same time the share of unwed mothers was rising, thepercentage of women who got married after they became pregnant butbefore they gave birth dropped from 14.9 percent to 11.7 percent offirst mothers.   This shift ``may reflect the opinion of some women that they maybe better off in the long run by relying more on the support oftheir parents and relatives for financial and emotional assistancethan by entering a potentially unstable marriage undertaken solelyto prevent an out-of-wedlock birth,'' reported bureau analyst AmaraBachu.   The share of single first mothers varied sharply by race, thestudy also found.   Among black women, 74.6 percent of first births to women age 15to 29 occurred out of wedlock between 1985 and 1988. That's up from54.1 percent between 1970 and 1974.   For Hispanic women the rate was 30.6 percent, up from 26.7percent. And white women recorded 19.6 percent premarital births, upfrom 11.5 percent.   The new report also confirmed the widely reported trend of womenpostponing births as they pursue educations and careers.   The ``increases in childbearing among women over 30 ... suggestthat childless women now more than in the past are deliberatelypostponing their childbearing to older ages,'' the report concluded.   For women age 30 to 34 the 1988 fertility rate was 81.6 birthsper 1,000 women, up from 60 in 1980 and 56.4 in 1976. A similar,though smaller, increase was reported for women 35 to 39.   The bureau also asked women about their plans for families andreported that, among childless wives age 25 to 29, 85 percent stillexpect to have a child at some point. That's up from 75 percent whoexpected a future birth in this age group in 1975.   And among married women in their early 30s, the share who expectto have a child someday rose to 54.4 percent from 33.5 percent since1975.   Nevertheless, the study concludes, ``the question remains: Howstrong is the commitment to childbearing after remaining married andchildless for several years?''   For women age 18 to 44, the study reported that 50.9 percent ofwomen giving birth in 1988 were in the work force, up from just 38percent in 1980.   ``Labor force participation for among women with newborn childrenis appreciably higher for college-educated women than for women''with less education, the report found.   Among new mothers with college degrees nearly 60 percent were inthe labor force, compared with 49 percent of high school graduatesand 34 percent who had not finished high school.   By race, 59 percent of black mothers were in the labor force,compared to 50 percent of whites and 37 percent among Hispanics.</TEXT></DOC>
