If sodium reacts with the blanketfuel, the product may be sufficient to induce cladding loading. Thisloading, then, has the potential to extend and/or induce cladding failuresand degrade overall rod integrity. These open breaches expose fuel orreaction product to sodium and release fission gas, and delayed neutrons,and, potentially, fuel to the primary coolant. These phenomena are beingstudied as part of a joint program in Experimental Breeder Reactor II(EBR-II) between the US Dept. of Energy and the Power Reactor and NuclearFuel Development Corporation of Japan. Operation of this breached blanketpin caused no operational problems at EBR-II, and the overall consequencesof RBCB operation of blanket fuel appears to be benign.</TEXT></DOC>
