Now the LBO era is waning, and so is Wesray.</LP><TEXT>   Wesray bought Gibson Greetings for $80 million in 1982.Sixteen months later, it took the card company public. Wesrayequity investors who put up just $1 million of the purchaseprice reaped $100 million.   Soon after the Gibson profits became widely known, bigsecurities firms rushed to set up buy-out departments. Theimitators hoped to repeat the success of Wesray and others inleveraged buy-outs.   But Wesray's presence has shrunk to a whisper. FormerTreasury Secretary William E. Simon, a co-founder of thefirm, quit in 1987. &quot;The bloom is off the rose,&quot; Mr. Simonsaid then, implying that he thought the LBO business hadpeaked.   More recently, Wesray's other co-founder, RaymondChambers, has effectively pulled out of the firm. People whoknow Mr. Chambers said he is spending nearly all of his timeon charitable work, including a tutoring program for poorchildren in Newark, N.J.   Mr. Chambers's loss was probably more crucial. GibsonGreetings' financial vice president, Ward Cavanaugh, said,&quot;Most of our contact was with Ray Chambers.&quot; While Mr. Simondidn't shirk financial details, he was known mostly for hiswide network of business contacts.   Messrs. Simon and Chambers timed their exits nicely. Intheir final year together at Wesray, they ranked among the400 richest people in the U.S., with personal fortunesestimated by Forbes magazine at $200 million each. Sincethen, the buy-out business has wilted, first because ofintense competition and more recently as a result of awidespread aversion to leverage and high-yield junk bonds.The two men declined to comment.   Wesray's remaining executives still are making money frombuy-outs, but they are pursuing much smaller deals than the$600 million purchases that Wesray carried out at its peak.The firm completed five small buy-outs last year, of whichonly one, the $70 million acquisition of Aladdin's CastleInc., was publicly announced.   People who have seen Wesray's current portfolio say thefirm has averaged a 70% annual return on 19 buy-outs sincethe start of 1987. That's a strong showing, but downsignificantly from Wesray's triple-digit returns of the early1980s.   Wesray stumbled with the 1988 buy-out of SimplicityPattern Co., which last summer said it couldn't pay intereston the junk bonds that helped finance its buy-out.&quot;Simplicity's equity is worthless, and its bonds are probablyworth five to 10 cents on the dollar,&quot; said Julian Schroder,an analyst at R.D. Smith andamp; Co. Simplicity officials declinedto comment.   As business slows at Wesray, some of its youngerinvestment bankers, who haven't made Simon-size fortunes yet,are jumping ship. A Wesray vice president, John Howard, andtwo lower-level dealmakers recently quit and joined VestarCapital Partners Inc., another New York buy-out group inwhich Wesray has a minority investment. Last year, Vestarcompleted five buy-outs, and bank lenders regard it as moreactive than Wesray.   In its prime, Wesray scored its biggest successes by usingvery high leverage, shrinking common equity well below the10% level that other buy-out groups favored. It wasn'tunusual for common equity to be as little as 1% of abuy-out's total price. The rest of the money was borrowed orprovided by preferred stock.   &quot;The Wesray formula was great for a few years,&quot; saidGerard Kennell, treasurer of Avis Rent-a-Car. Avis wasacquired by Wesray in a 1986 buy-out in which less than 7% ofthe purchase price was equity. The buy-out was a typicalWesray success. It produced profits of more than 20 times theequity invested. &quot;But it's become harder to do those kinds ofdeals,&quot; Mr. Kennell said. &quot;Banks are looking for a lot moreequity&quot; before they finance such a transaction.   While Wesray President Frank Richardson and Chairman FrankWalsh declined to be interviewed, one major Wesray investordenies market rumors that the firm is thinking of closing itsNew York office or disbanding. &quot;That's not true at all,&quot; saidthis investor, who declined to be identified. &quot;Some fellowsare taking an active role at Vestar, which we regard as partof the same family. Everyone else in our New York office willremain. The New Jersey office has had, and will continue tohave, more people,&quot; he said. (Wesray has dual headquarters inNew York and Morristown, N.J.)   Still, indications are that Wesray is switching its focusaway from the once-glamorous LBO area. Instead, it may optfor duller but more conventional types of investing. Wesrayhas only its own executives' money to invest; it never raiseda buy-out fund from outside investors.   &quot;Wesray is likely to diversify its investments over time,&quot;the Wesray investor said. Among the firm's possibilities arelooking for profits in depressed junk bonds, taking minorityequity positions in companies, and hiring outside managers toinvest some of the Wesray partners' money. &quot;It's a businessthat will go through a number of chapters,&quot; the Wesrayinvestor said.   In fact, some people think Wesray's retreat may be thesmartest way to deal with the new anti-leverage climate.&quot;Their returns have always been stupendous -- some of thebest in the business,&quot; said Domenic Baione, a lender atManufacturers Hanover Trust Co. &quot;Whatever else happens,they've had a great run.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
