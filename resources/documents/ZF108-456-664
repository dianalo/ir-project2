Cairns Jr., vice president of information systemsat DuPont, is a busy man.andM;When he's not consolidating data centers, he's expanding the company's use ofartificial intelligence.andP;  When he's not building networks, he's tearing downbarriers between DuPont and its customers via electronic data interchange.andO;When he's not pitching the value of IS to his superiors, he's hitting homeruns with his peers by serving their IS needs.andP;  When he's not managing the IStroops directly beneath him, he's liberating the creative forces of the ISteams that serve DuPont's business units.andM;Nevertheless, six months of phone calls and faxes between DATAMATION andCairns' able aide-de-camp, John Wheeler, finally paid off a short while ago.andO;Cairns spent 90 minutes with DATAMATION, patiently recounting the IS journeyhe traveled at DuPont in the 1980s and energetically speculating on the roadahead in the 1990s.andM;Here are the highlights of our conversation with Cairns, a 58-year-old U.S.andO;Air Force veteran with bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees from theMassachusetts Institute of Technology.andM;We really did talk to DuPont, and you really ought to read it.andM;Q: What are DuPont's corporate goals?andP;  And how might information technologyhelp achieve them?andM;A: Our objective of the company is to really be a great global company, andthat's the way our chairman defines it.andP;  Great in the sense that it meets itsfinancial commitments and global in the sense that we're dealing with marketsand opportunities around the world....andM;We in information systems [IS] have been looking at the global aspects of ourbusiness for a few years now.andP;  And the first aspect of it is to be sure youbuild your wide networks and then to run your computers on those networksirrespective of where they are located geographically for the systems thatare run globally.andM;Business managers now want to know information around the world.andP;  They wantit for scheduling in plants worldwide.andP;  They want to know where theirinventories are.andP;  They want to know where the orders are being placed.andP;  Theywant to be able to interface with customers around the world.andP;  And they needto communicate with their organizations irrespective of location.andP;  They wantmore data, more quickly and more accurately on a worldwide basis than everbefore.andM;Q: How is the global focus changing the sort of IS strategies that you arepursuing?andM;A: We have four major strategies.andP;  And they are all equal.andM;The first strategy is to have a worldwide, functionally sufficient, reliableand secure IS infrastructure that we run at a lower cost than ourcompetition....andP;  They are important adjectives.andP;  It has to be global innature, and it has to be reliable.andP;  The reliability requirements areincreasing every year or every day.andP;  You have to be secure because we'retying into numbers of customers around the world.andP;  We're putting them on ournetwork and into our computer.andP;  Fundamentally, we have to do it at lowercost--absolutely lower....andM;The second strategy is .andP;  .  .  to stimulate and enable our businesses to useinformation technology.andP;  So it's an education process, it's a marketingprocess, with not only upper management but [also with] business management.andM;.  .  .The third is to introduce appropriate new technology faster than thecompetition.andP;  An example is our involvement with artificial intelligence.andM;And the last strategy involves stewardship.andP;  We feel that we're stewards forthe total [IS] activity.andP;  Although I report to our upper management on thetotality of the activity and define the strategy, I only have directlyreporting to me 20% of the IS resources.andP;  But I have to manage across thoseactivities.andP;  .  .  .andM;Putting Limits on TechnologyandM;Q: How do you manage such diverse interests?andM;A: What we did about eight years ago was to initiate a program whereby wedecided to limit the technology base.andP;  For general-purpose computers, welimited it to IBM 370s--not [IBM] 36s or 38s or 8100; [to Digital] VAXs; and[to] any HP systems running the MPE operating systems.andP;  .  .  .  We've donethis around the world.andP;  .  .  .  By doing that, we have been able to leverageour resources by remotely supporting those activities.andM;Here are some examples.andP;  We have a data center just outside of Frankfurt,which is a clone of the major data center [at headquarters in Wilmington,Del.].andP;  We operate that [West German data center] with no systemsprogrammers.andP;  We have the operator console up in our activity field.andP;  .  .  .andO;That means all systems programmming is done right here [at headquarters].andO;Then we take tapes over [to Frankfurt] or download it electronically....andP;  Andwe do that in as remote places as Parkersburg, West Virginia.andM;So there are four data centers in the United States.andP;  And now we're going toopen one in Singapore in the third quarter of this year.andM;Q: So that gives DuPont six data centers worldwide?andM;A: Yes.andP;  But we are going to consolidate to four--two in the United States,one in Singapore and one in Europe.andP;  In the United States, the centers willbe here in Wilmington and the other is in Oklahoma....andM;By being able to limit the technology, okay, and remotely support it, we'reoperating IBM data centers that are clones around the world.andP;  We also do thisto VAX and HP systems--not all, but many of them.andP;  By being able to limityour technology platforms, you have a much greater ability to move systems.andM;Now, where would we like to be? ...andP;  In the future, we would like to have anopen architecture so that we could take advantage of that capability of asingle operating system, single telecommunications protocol around the world.andM;Q: Is cost reduction the chief driver in your decision to consolidateDuPont's data centers?andM;A: Yes.andP;  We had done it [cut costs] by cloning them.andP;  Now we can even getmore by combining them.andP;  And today, for example, we have a financialapplication where the terminal is in Korea and the application is being runin Germany.andP;  And .andP;  .  .  it's on line.andP;  It doesn't matter where yourcomputer is.andP;  .  .  .andM;Software licensing is becoming a greater and greater percentage of your cost.andO;So how can you start to limit that?andP;  Consolidation of data centers, fewerexperienced people, etc.andM;We want to be a lower costing company.andP;  And we say that all the time, and wedrive it home.andP;  We want to be the initiator of the cost drive.andP;  And I feelthat we're ahead of that.andP;  .  .  .  We're in a proactive mode in it ratherthan a reactive mode.andP;  'Cause I think those [the pressures from uppermanagement to reduce costs] are going to get greater.andM;Q: When do you see the day at DuPont when it has but one operating system andone communications protocol?andM;A: We're not sure.andP;  We have decided that today is not the time.andP;  We're sayingthat, in order to understand open systems, we have to experiment with them.andO;So we're running pilot programs in the area of open systems.andP;  .  .  .  Wewould define them in terms of UNIX.andM;Q: Have you also reined in the types of desktop systems that can be used atDuPont?andM;A: On our PCs, we have limited those to MS/DOS and Macintosh at this time.andO;We have not guidelined OS/2 yet.andP;  That's because there isn't enough softwareout there.andP;  But that will happen probably sometime this year or early nextyear.andP;  It's inevitable.andP;  We hoped that we would not have to go to OS/2.andP;  Wehoped that UNIX would be mature enough and that we could bypass OS/2.andP;  But wedon't think it's going to mature [enough to allow us to do so].andM;Q: What's holding open systems back?andM;A: It's a combination of factors.andP;  Trying to get major vendors together toagree on what version of UNIX is going to be used has delayedstandardization.andP;  Is to going to be AIX [IBM's version of UNIX]?andP;  Is it goingto be Berkeley [the version of UNIX developed at the University of Californiacampus]?andP;  .  .  .  And there was the battle going on between ATandamp;T .andP;  .  . andO;the Open Software Foundation.andP;  .  .  .  We would like to see them together.andO;We think that hopefully will take place, but it isn't in place now.andP;  In themeantime, we'll try to get some experience in UNIX.andP;  First will be in thehigh-end workstation area.andP;  .  .  .  And then we will look at otheractivities.andP;  But they won't be in the commercial transactions systems area.andM;A Global Network StrategyandM;Q: Earlier, you mentioned that DuPont's chief IS thrust in recent years hasbeen in building up the network infrastructure.andP;  Please amplify that point.andM;A: Our infrastructure is in the layers.andP;  The bottom layer .andP;  .  .  is thebasic telecommunications transport--just wires and circuits.andP;  We have beenvery aggressive in communications in the United States.andP;  For example, we werethe first company to go to Tariff 12 [a sophisticated network service offeredby common carriers such as ATandamp;T, MCI Communications Corp. and US SprintCommunications Co.].andP;  We're pursuing every way we can to get our line costsdown in the United States, such as cotransmitting voice and data using ourown multiplexers, made by NET [Network Equipment Technologies Inc. of RedwoodCity, Calif.].andP;  We're on the fiber-optic cable to Europe.andP;  There in manycases we own our own multiplexers, but on a combination of leased lines andpublic networks.andP;  We have satellite circuits to the Far East, where we wantto be on fiber-optic cable as soon as it's in place.andP;  .  .  .andM;Sitting on top of that layer are what we call the basic networks.andP;  Today, werun three data networks, a voice network and a video network.andP;  The datanetworks are SNA [Systems Network Architecture] for IBM, DECNet for VAXs andan X.25 network really for the HP equipment.andP;  On top of that are the threeoperating systems for IBM, DEC and HP.andP;  On top of them are some basic utilityprograms, such as electronic mail.andP;  That's what we call our IS or networkinfrastructure.andM;Q: How much has DuPont invested in networks?andM;A: We have leased those [telecommunications lines, services, equipment]wherever we can.andP;  There is certainly some investment in multiplexers.andP;  It'snot hundred of millions of dollars.andP;  It's negotiating and entering contractswith various communications companies around the world.andM;Q: How much of the network management function resides within DuPont?andP;  Howmuch of its rests with your service suppliers?andM;A: It's shared.andM;Q: In the future, what will determine whether you assume greater or lessercontrol of networks?andM;A: It will depend upon the performance....andP;  We have outsourced some of thatactivity, but not to the extent where they [service providers] have completecontrol.andP;  For example, in the United States, they are our multiplexers, butthe circuits and software-defined networks attached to them are leased ...andO;and negotiated from ATandamp;T....andP;  Our 800 numbers come from ATandamp;T and MCI.andP;  Soit's a combination.andM;We want to know when things go down.andP;  We have to monitor it.andP;  We have 800companies up on our electronic data interchange.andP;  Thousands of people--ourcustomers--are directly tied into our computers.andP;  So you can't have acustomer hanging out there.andM;Q: Would you like to off-load greater network responsibility onto yourservice providers?andM;A: Yes...if they can manage that part of it.andP;  We don't bring value added tothat.andP;  As long as they can manage the reliability and security aspects of it,they could manage the lines....andP;  They wouldn't manage the SNA or DECNetnetworks because they are all over the world....andP;  They don't know yourcomputing environment so you don't want them to manage the data network.andP;  Youwant them to manage the transport....andM;Keeping a Competitive IS EdgeandM;Q: Are any of your competitors ahead of DuPont in the use of informationtechnology?andM;A: We're above average, but I see aspects of companies that I think areahead....andP;  Dow [Chemical Co. is one,] in some areas.andP;  And there are companiesin Europe that impress me because they got their arms around the whole ISactivity before we did.andM;I've got the best people.andP;  I could run with anybody.andM;Q: Since one of your objectives is to best your competitors, how do youmeasure yourself against them?andP;  Can you, for example, point to a product thatDuPont brought to market faster than rivals because of its IS prowess?andM;A: First, let's talk about doing things at a lower cost than the competitors.andO;What we try to do is try to understand what the competition is doing....andP;  Ifsomething can be done cheaper somewhere else and with the same reliability,it's our job to go out and get that....andP;  We're not trying to say that we aregoing to manage it at lower cost.andP;  We've got to add value, or we have to beable to go ut and seek out the people who can provide it.andM;Now appropriate technology is a factor in competition.andP;  That doesn't mean alltechnology, but just what's appropriate for us.andP;  Here are some examples:andM;We were the first chemical company with a Cray supercomputer....andP;  Anotherexample is in our initiatives in artificial intelligence.andP;  We did itdifferently than most other people.andP;  We did it with some very small systems.andO;We have 800 systems out there in artificial intelligence, and we feel that[the large number has] given us some advantage.andM;Q: On what are your artificial intelligence systems based?andP;  And where arethey being applied?andM;A: They're based on PC platforms.andP;  A lot of those AI systems are used inmanufacturing, a few in marketing and a lot in scheduling and similarapplications.andP;  Our strategy is that by having them small and by having somestandard platforms on which to run them, we are able to train end users tobuild them themselves.andP;  So that if you re the expert, you are not threatenedby expert systems because you are building your expert system for yourself.andO;The strategy has been pretty effective....andM;Championing in a Matrix WorldandM;Q: If only 20% of DuPont's IS resources report directly to you, who managesthe other 80%?andM;A: DuPont is organized into nine major departments; other companies call themdivisions.andP;  They are our major entities, and they occupy some major regionsin the world.andP;  Our strategy has been to locate IS resources within thoseorganizations ...andP;  for two reasons.andM;Part of it is that we want them to be responsive to end users.andP;  By being inthe organization, the users can control the amount of resources, they cancontrol the allocation of resources and they can control priorities withouthaving to go to some central organization.andP;  [We tell them:] You have to do itwithin these standard platforms and networks....andM;[Second], by having that responsibility managment is more involved.andP;  Itbecomes part of your direct profit-and-loss statement....andM;I [central IS] am billed out.andP;  The 20% or 25% of the IS resources that reportinto me are billed out completely on a usage basis.andP;  So that you as a managernow, you have control over 80% of your resources; the other 20% is billeddirectly to you.andP;  But it's all yours.andP;  That's been an important part of ourstrategy.andM;Q: How many managers and professionals are there at DuPont, and how many ofthem have desktop systems?andM;A: I would say 75 to 85% of the [46,700] professionals have a desktop device.andO;You're starting to find that they have one on their desks, one in their labsand one at home.andM;Q: What are those managers pushing hardest for IS to do--image processing?andM;A: We see image coming--compound documents and similar things.andP;  It's beingsomewhat pushed by managers, but we at IS feel that we have to be in aposition to respond.andP;  One of the advantages that we have--one that helpedestablish IS' credibility--we got out in front of office automation reallybefore it got hot.andM;What are managers pressuring us for?andP;  For a couple of things.andP;  One, they'reasking us how we can reduce costs by bringing back-office systems into the ISinfrastructure.andP;  Two, they're asking how they can be more responsive to theneeds in the marketplace.andP;  How can you help us with the business?andP;  How canyou help me, the manager, understand what the potential of the marketplaceis?andP;  How can you educate me as to what I could do?andM;Q: Throughout DuPont, how many IS workers and IS managers are there?andM;A: Given that I have roughly 20% of them, and there are 900 people who workfor me, that means there are nearly 5,000 IS people worldwide.andM;Now the trick is to combine the best of centralization anddecentralization....andP;  We only want to centralize what we can get advantagefrom, from our company size.andP;  Those are things like negotiating, networking,standardized platforms....andP;  And we want to have the businesses be able to beresponsible.andM;Q: How do you coordinate such stewardship?andM;A: The IS counterparts report to the presidents and to me....andP;  I meet withthose people in the general corporate environment, probably weekly.andP;  Rightnow, I've just finished a session with them one-on-one....andP;  That's how wemanage.andP;  How you manage them has to be consistent with how the companymanages.andP;  So we mirror the company in a sense.andM;Q: With the IS management structure you have in place, what happens when oneor two of your businesses are in a recession?andP;  Is the IS strategy of adepartment solely at the economic mercy of the market it serves?andM;A: There is some impact.andP;  For example, we all know that the automative areais down in the United States.andP;  That department of DuPont is looking atsystems activity just like it's looking at allother activities.andP;  If you'rethe head of automotive, you're going to look at the hard.andP;  It's our job towork with him in reducing cost, possibly by deferring certain programs....andM;We have businesses that are up and some that are down.andP;  And no matter whatthe economy is, there are some of those dynamics going on.andM;Q: Do you ever or often find yourself championing certain IS projects indepartments where business is lousy and therefore such projects are at risk?andM;A: I do that quite a bit.andP;  sometimes they buy it and sometimes they don't.andO;There are certain things it's important for department presidents tounderstand from my point of view....andP;  In a job that is one of managing like Ihave described, credibility is very important.andP;  It derives from beingaggressive when you need to be aggressive and being nonaggressive when it'snot appropriate.andP;  So it's a balance.andM;Q: How does DuPont measure productivity gains that result from itsinvestments in information technology?andM;A: The return on an information system is always difficult to take a look at...andP;  because there are so many other factors that are going on within thecompany that affect bottom line.andM;Q: How are most on DuPont's departmental presidents measuring value?andM;A: They're looking at: Are systems really helping them with their businesses?andO;Are they consistent with the businesses they are in today--an importantfactor?...andP;  They're certainly looking at the growth of IS costs.andP;  They'realways asking: Where do you think we stand?andM;We have told them that IS as a percent of sales is not a good measure.andO;What's more important is to look at: What's the value of IS to the business?andO;How fast is it growing?andP;  What do they think and what do we think theircompetition is doeing to the extent of IS expenditures?andP;  Where do they seetheir competition getting a competitive advantage through these systems?andO;Where do they think they are getting such advantage?andP;  It's a continuingdynamic.andM;Q: Are you saying that there is not a single good measure for determining thevalue of IS?andM;A: That's right.andM;Q: Nevertheless, can you give us some idea of whe{ther IS costs at DuPont areup or down in 1990 versus previous years?andM;A: They were up slightly in 1989 versus 1988.andP;  They will be up very slightlynext year.andP;  They will be up less than inflation in 1990 over 1989.andM;Where the Money IsandM;Q: Will such low budget growth continue?andP;  Is it a trend?andM;A: Yes.andP;  Five or six years ago, we were in the double-digit growth rates inIS spending.andP;  If you plot the growth rate, it has continually come down.andO;There are a number of reasons why.andP;  First of all, you're dealing with a verylarge base.andP;  So growth in double digits can hardly be accomplished just fromthe size of the activity.andM;Two, it's becoming a significant portion of corporate costs, a verymeasurable portion, so it gets scrutinized.andP;  As far as allocation of capitalinto IS, you're competing with other ways of using capital.andP;  So you'restarting to see those pressures take place as IS spending has become acertain size.andP;  When IS was growing, nobody paid too much attention to it.andO;But as it becomes 2 or 3% [of revenues], IS is looked at in terms of howeffectively it's being managed.andP;  Those growth rates for us will continue tobe stabilized--certainly below inflation.andM;Q: Is the improved price/performance seen in today's systems also a factor incurbing IS spending growth?andM;A: Yes, very much so.andP;  We have been given unit price reductions on computingin the last few years.andP;  We really feel we've been very aggressive intelecommunications.andP;  Our data networks have grown 50% a year over the lastfew years while our voice networks have grown 5 to 6%--and our costs are downyear to year!andM;Q: How are you tackling the white-collar productivity issue?andM;A: We have a study team right now that's in place.andP;  .  .  .  There will be asmuch change in this office environment, in the broad sense, between now andthe next 10 or 15 years as before and after the advent of the personalcomputers.andP;  A lot of people don't feel like that, but I do.andP;  In order toaccommodate, organizations have to change.andP;  And roles have to change.andP;  It'snot a technology problem.andP;  It's an organization/learning problem.andP;  It'ssomething that you have to experience.andP;  You have to walk down that learningcurve to do it.andP;  And so those who start and walk down that learning curvewill have an advantage.andM;My secretary now does spreadsheets and graph presentations, graphics andthings like that.andP;  But her role is different today than it was eight yearsago.andP;  And I think 10 years from now it's going to be significantly differentthan it is today.andP;  And I think my role will be different.andM;Q: How so?andM;A: I'll have much greater span of control.andP;  I'll be able to better shareinformation.andP;  .  .  .  But I really don't know how it will be different.andO;What bothers me is that I can't get anybody in academia or at any of themajor vendors to talk much about that.andM;Q: Have you said as much to upper management in your twice-a-yearpresentations?andM;A: I told them that.andP;  I laid out for them four things in IS that I reallyfelt were going to impact them.andP;  The first was increased competitiveadvantage to the business from its systems.andP;  The second was an increase inintercompany computing.andP;  The third was the office area, which I predictedwould be very different.andP;  And the fourth was that IS would either be afacilitator or an inhibitor of globalization.andM;Q: What is your white-collar productivity study team looking at?andM;A: .andP;  .  .  What do we see within our company today are the best practices?andO;Where do we see the embryos of that taking place?andP;  What do we know from othercompanies that are willing to share?andP;  When will that take place?andP;  Also, whatdo we think it will look like?andM;Q: Is this where your executive information system fits?andM;A: An executive information system is a way of presenting data to thoseindividuals who can look at that and start making some decisions on it.andM;Q: Do you have a dedicated EIS right now?andM;A: Yes.andP;  .  .  .  It's a Comshare package.andP;  We have one with 150 people on itright now, but there will be 400 on it.andP;  We have a situation today where thehead of DuPont in Europe is on the executive information system, whichresides here in Wilmington.andP;  We download certain encrypted information everyday to his PC so that when he gets on that system to talk to somebody in theUnited States, whether it's the chairman or the vice-chairman or members ofthe executive committee, it's the same information.andP;  The same is true inTokyo and in Brazil.andM;Q: Are these high-touch executives?andP;  Are they banging away at keyboards?andM;A: No.andP;  It's mouse driven.andP;  But eventually they want the keyboard because itgives them commands that allow them to make queries.andM;Q: Have you been able to measure the productivity of the executives who haveaccess to the EIS?andM;A: The chairman says he can't do without it.andP;  And that's good enough for me.andO;And he said that publicly.andM;Q: Do you foresee a time when your executive information system works on areal-time basis--that is, as data are processed on your commercial systems,information is generated on the EIS?andM;A: I don't know.andP;  One of the things you want to avoid is having upper levelexecutives monitor sales by the hour.andP;  That's not their job.andP;  .  .  . andO;They're disciplined enough right now.andP;  That has been a significant aspect ofthe success of a system: high-level people are not getting involved inoperational questions.andM;Looking in Outside CustomersandM;Q: The company's annual report and other corporate messages emphasizeelectronic links between DuPont and its customers and suppliers.andP;  Howwidespread is this activity at DuPont?andM;A: We started this five years ago, and we think we were a leader in thisactivity.andP;  Until then, you [as a customer] could not dial into our databases.andO;We managed them like a fortress--we still do.andP;  But we now have 800 companies[that electronically deal with DuPont].andP;  .  .  .  We have been much moreaggressive at doing so with our customers than our suppliers.andM;They have access in a limited way to databases.andP;  They are on electronic mailsystems.andP;  .  .  .  It all has to do with the cost of switching incurred by acustomer in switching from one supplier to another.andP;  If you're a company thatwe're dealing with and we have your engineers dealing with our engineers onelectronic mail and they've established a relationship and they know eachother, it's different than just working through the purchasing agents.andP;  IfJohn [our competitor, figuratively speaking] comes in with a penny a pounddecrease in price or a nickel a pound, okay?andP;  The cost for you to switch tohim in the past would have been just that.andP;  Now you have to switch yourengineers.andP;  Who are they going to contact?andP;  How is the relationship going tobe developed?andP;  How are the partnerships going to be enhanced?andP;  Because we'rereally talking about greater partnerships between companies these days.andP;  Andso by doing that, switching costs will increase.andP;  .  .  .andM;You're not only going to see that in electronic mail, you're going to see itin being able to move designs back and forth.andP;  There's a whole host of waysto do it.andP;  The lead that you had there, of course, will dissipate now aseverybody does it.andP;  But by getting there--by getting there among the firstpeople, not the first certainly, but among the first of those--it enhancesthe partnership image between DuPont and DuPont's customers.andM;Q: How do you effect such linkage?andM;A: You've got to separate the two [to separate common from custom links].andO;One is electronic data interchange, which is basic.andP;  We were aggressive inseeking out ways to establish EDI links--not necessarily through mycounterparts.andP;  We got to the purchasing people, telling them that the cost ofdoing business with us will decrease if we can do it electronically.andM;The second aspect is setting up communications betweenprofessionals--technical, marketing or managerial.andP;  That's achieved not somuch by working through my counterparts as it is through the counterparts ofour marketing and professional people .andP;  .  .  even to the extent where wegive them [our customers' professional staff] terminals or PCs for gettinginto our systems.andP;  .  .  .  We don't do very much of that, but that's how alot of it started.andM;Q: Where do you see such IS-enabled linkage going in the future?andM;A: It's going to facilitate partnerships.andP;  Companies are going to be closertogether.andP;  And it's going to fuzz up the boundaries between companies to agreater extent than it ever has in the past.andP;  So it's going to be aconnection of intercompany computing.andP;  These networks and computers--thesmarts--can be located anywhere, and so they're going to be between companiesthat way.andM;Q: Is the intercompany computing phenomenon occurring throughout the world?andM;A: It's being led in the United States.andP;  It's being closely followed inEurope.andP;  And the professional-to-professional connection is lagging in theFar East.andP;  .  .  .  In the Far East, there are still some cultural problemsabout managers and professionals having PCs on their desks.andP;  So we have toovercome that.andP;  And you have the language barrier, too.andM;That's the thing that's going to be important in the future--the ability tocommunicate in various languages.andP;  You can do that today in the Romance andGermanic languages, but it's very difficult to do it in the Asiaticlanguages.andP;  But that's the pressure globally that we are going to see--themultilingual, multicultural capability.andM;So it's really layers of things that you have to worry about.andP;  That's adifferent order of magnitude than just worrying about the United States.andM;IS and InnovationandM;Q: Where do you see the major source of innovation coming from in the use ofinformation technology--Competitors?andP;  Suppliers?andP;  Workers?andP;  Executives?andM;A: The innovation continues to come from the user interface, which letsmanagers have enough knowledge and see ideas to make things happen.andP;  And thattakes place both in the United States and abroad.andP;  I've seen some innovation,but not very much, from the top.andP;  Certainly the CEO is the champion for theexecutive information system.andM;So I see it taking place at the area where people can have innovative ideas.andO;I don't see much of it coming from the IS infrastructure.andM;Q: In other words, it has been the end users who have been the primeinnovators?andM;A: A lot of ideas come from them, and then IS works with them on what theycan do and can't do.andP;  It's important for us to champion those ideas.andP;  It'simportant for us to experiment.andP;  The worse thing that we can do is to be theorganization that says: hell, we tried it, but we can't do that.andM;But here's the trick: How do you do that without compromising your basicthrust to limit technology?andP;  So you've got to make some exceptions.andP;  You'vegot to be willing to experiment.andP;  It's that balance that's important.andP;  Youcan't compromise some of your basics.andP;  But you've got to experiment.andP;  Andyou've got to be the champion.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
