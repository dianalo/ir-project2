D'ALESSIO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Creation of a North American common market,consisting of the United States, Canada and Mexico, is an ideawhich appeals to a large majority of U.S. residents, according to anew poll.   The poll, released this week, was taken for a group of leadingMexican business executives and an affiliated group in this country.   The groups, the Mexican Council of Businessmen and the U.S.Mexican Development Corporation, say such a common market is neededto compete successfully with Japan and the European EconomicCommunity.   ``Of the 1,200 individuals polled throughout the U.S., 85percent favored a North American common market to offsetanticipated heavy competition when the EEC countries drop theirtrade frontiers in 1992,'' said Jeffrey Peters, president of theU.S. Mexican Development Corporation (USDC).   Francisco del Cueto, a spokesman for the Mexican Council ofBusinessmen (MCB), also said 1992 would be a critical year forinternational trade.   His organization, which includes owners, chairmen and executiveofficers of Mexico's top 36 industrial groups, has long stressedU.S.-Mexican cooperation.   Nino Noriega, a USDC spokesman, said no formal proposals for thecreation of such a common market had been submitted to governmentofficials in the three nations involved.   Noriega, however, said there had been some preliminary talkswith several U.S. congressmen.   ``It's an evolutionary thing that appears to be inevitable,''Noriega said of the elimination of North American trade barriers.``It's a matter of common sense.   ``You have: Mexico, with vast natural resources and a large poolof less expensive labor; the U.S., with technological expertise anda highly developed economy; and Canada, with a small population,but a strong currency and credit power.''   ``Trade barriers have essentially been erased between the U.S.and Canada,'' Noriega said.   ``And we have proof that the same thing would work between theU.S. and Mexico through the `Maquiladora' program, whereby U.S.manufacturers have goods finished in communities across the Mexicanborder and reimported into this country.''   Noriega said some people worry about cheap Mexican labor takingjobs away from U.S. workers, but that that wouldn't be the case ifcooperation created jobs in Mexico.   ``Consider,'' he said, ``the resources in Mexico and thepotential Mexican market for luxury goods the U.S. market isalready saturated with.   ``People think of the Rio Grande as being like the Berlin Wall.Most don't realize that if that wall came down, the heavy traffic _businesswise _ would be southbound.''   The telephone poll taken during November for the MCB and USDCemployed a sample similar to the U.S. national averages by gender,age, ethnic background, educationl level and political philosophy,Noriega said.   Not surprisingly, the poll found that people of Hispanicbackground, whether it be Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban or fromanother Spanish-speaking region, took a greater interest in Mexicanaffairs than the general U.S. population.   While only one third of the total respondents considered Mexicoa good place for American investment, more than 55 percent of theHispanic respondents considered it so.   At the same time, though, 90 percent of the total respondentssaid it was important for the U.S. to help Mexico to move aheadeconomically.   The poll, however, also revealed that many non-HispanicAmericans have little knowledge of Mexico's political institutionsand recent history.   ``Only about a third correctly identified Mexico as a democraticcountry,'' said del Cueto. ``A greater number _ almost 40 percent,in fact _ believe it to be socialistic, while more than 7 percenteven termed it a communist nation.''</TEXT></DOC>
