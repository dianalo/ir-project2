Afer 10 days inhalation lung dust content and lymphnode dust content has been determined at different intervals up to 3month. The results are: 1. The mineral rich cytotoxic dust is more efficientlyeliminated than the coal dust. 2. The absolute lymphatic penetrationis higher for the coal dust; relatively, on the basis of the lung dustload, the penetration of the mineral rich dust is better. 3. The numberof alveolar macrophages is highest of exposure to the mineral mine dust.4. The determination of free O/sub 2/-radicals indicates activated macrophagesafter exposure to the mineral dust. It is suggested, that the factorelimination-organ dose is carefully to be considered together with specificfibrotic dust effects in the hygienic evaluation of mine dusts.</TEXT></DOC>
