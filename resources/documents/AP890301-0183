(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The head of the state's parole programconceded that it was a mistake to release a twice-convicted childmolester who was arrested again this week on charges of abductingand raping a young girl.   ``We made a bad decision on this case, no question about it,''Guy Revell, chairman of the Florida Parole and Probation Commission,said Tuesday.   Frank Potter, 43, was paroled by officials both in Florida andNew Jersey in 1987. He was arrested in Tampa on Monday and chargedwith abducting and sexually assaulting a 7-year-old girl as she wason her way to school three weeks earlier.   Twice before, Potter was paroled after serving time for sexualassaults on children in Palmetto, Fla., in 1968, and in Lakewood,N.J., in 1976.   In all, Potter had been sentenced to 55 years in prison in bothstates and served fewer than 20 years.   Revell said a probation officer recommended in a memo in Julythat ``Potter needs to be in a more structured situation thanregular parole,'' and recommended community control with anelectronic monitoring device.   Revell said it was only a matter of time before Potter's sentencewas to end. So the commission gave him parole on condition he attenda treatment program.   ``And it didn't work out,'' Revell said. ``We tried and the manviolated. We tried to protect the community as best we could throughsome sort of formal treatment program.''</TEXT></DOC>
