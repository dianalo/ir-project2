Schlender (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AAPL MSFT HWP </CO><IN> EDP </IN><TEXT>   Apple Computer Inc. said it filed a lawsuit in federal court in San Jose, Calif., yesterday charging Microsoft Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. with infringing on certain copyrights that Apple believes protect the audio-visual &quot;look-and-feel&quot; of its popular Macintosh personal computers.    The suit, which pits two of the personal computer industry's most celebrated companies, alleges that Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard have copied certain on-screen graphical features in software products that enable personal computers to juggle and share data between various applications programs.    A spokesman for Hewlett-Packard said the company was unable to comment until its lawyers had read the six-page lawsuit. Microsoft officials weren't available to comment.    Specifically, the suit alleges that Microsoft's Windows version 2.03, and Hewlett-Packard's recently released New-Wave program, too closely resemble the on-screen appearance of the Macintosh.    Several years ago Apple granted Microsoft a license to incorporate certain aspects of its so-called graphical user interface. But a spokeswoman said the Cupertino, Calif.-based computer maker believes that the &quot;individual screen displays are illegal copies and exceed limits of license rights Apple granted.&quot; Microsoft officials couldn't be reached for comment.    Apple's action revives an unsettled issue for the computer software industry over just how much the on-screen look and feel can be legally protected. Last year, Lotus Development Corp. of Cambridge, Mass., sued Paperback Software Inc. for allegedly copying the appearance and functionality of Lotus's big-selling 1-2-3 financial spreadsheet. And two years ago Apple, itself, used the threat of a lawsuit to preclude Digital Research Inc. from using certain graphical features in its Gem applications program manager, which closely resembled the icons and symbols and &quot;pull down menus&quot; that characterize Apple's popular Macintosh.    Stewart Alsop, an industry analyst who publishes PC Letter, said: &quot;If they can prove that they own the look and feel that most computers are trying to emulate, then they own something very popular and can make more money on it,&quot; by requiring other companies to pay royalties and take out licenses to use similar audio-visual features.    The suit is especially threatening to Microsoft, currently developing what it calls &quot;Presentation Manager&quot; to handle the on-screen appearance of International Business Machines' new family of advanced personal computers.    The Presentation Manager, which in most aspects looks very much like the Windows product that Apple is challenging, is Microsoft's attempt to bring much of the graphical pizazz of Apple's hot-selling Macintosh to IBM and compatible machines.    Hewlett-Packard's New Wave, which operates on IBM-compatible personal computers in conjunction with Microsoft's Windows, makes it easy for computer users to move data and images between several applications programs.    Apple said it doesn't intend to legally challenge developers of applications programs, such as word processors, spreadsheets and the like, for copying its audio-visual appearance, and in fact will encourage them to continue following the Macintosh model.    Apple didn't invent the icon-based look-and-feel of its Macintosh computer. Most of the early development took place at Xerox Corp.'s Palo Alto Research Center in California.    Apple licensed some of that technology from Xerox and enhanced and added to it before making it part of the operating system software that controls the Macintosh computer, routing data, graphics and information throughout the machine. </TEXT></DOC>
