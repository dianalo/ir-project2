The small biotechnology firm has a joint venture with Du Pont Co. to market the growth hormone drug in the U.S., but Bio-Technology's application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been held up.    Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco, Calif., and Eli Lilly andamp; Co. of Indianapolis both sell genetically engineered versions of human growth hormone under a special &quot;orphan drug&quot; status that gives them exclusive marketing rights in the U.S.    So far, the FDA has denied Bio-Technology's claim that its genetically engineered product is different from the two others and also ought to get the special protection.    Meanwhile, SmithKline, a Philadelphia medicine maker, will seek approval to market the product abroad. Sim Fass, BioTechnology president, said sales abroad might reach $20 million to $30 million a year. The U.S. market for the growth hormone, approved for use only in treating dwarfism, is currently about $120 million a year. </TEXT></DOC>
