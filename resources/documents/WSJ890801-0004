Completing a major review of competition policy, Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan says he will be scrutinizing not only new proposals for national subsidies, but will soon begin a broad review of existing subsidies that may cause unfair competition among community companies.    EC nations annually pump out industrial aid valued at about 3% of gross national product. The assistance ranges from fat subsidies for auto makers and steel companies to leaner financing for start-up companies, for research or for product launchings on export markets.    In 1986, the most recent year for which data are available, subsidies added up to the equivalent of $109.6 billion, with the agriculture, coal and transportation industries receiving the greatest share.    Sir Leon believes the community's program to create a single market by 1992 will intensify the temptation among member states to try to prop up their less competitive industries.    Reflecting his determination to crack down, the commission last week said it will investigate a revised Dutch aid package for AB Volvo. &quot;No other EC car manufacturer benefits from such a favorable financial instrument for the development of new car models,&quot; the commission declared.    Italy wins the subsidy sweepstakes by a long shot. In 1986, the country doled out close to $26.31 billion to its industries, more than three times as much as West Germany, four times as much as France and eight times as much as Britain. The EC says Italian aid is also growing at a faster pace than assistance in the other member states.    Mergers and other cross-border pacts are proliferating in Europe, fueling monopoly fears.    The commission says there were 383 mergers within the community last year, a 26% jump from 1987. And there were 111 joint-venture agreements, a 23% rise.    The largest number of mergers occurred in the chemical sector, followed by the food-and-drink industry. Geographically, France witnessed 122 mergers, followed by the United Kingdom with 106, West Germany with 52 and Italy with 49.    Continued concentration of industry at this pace could create serious problems for the planned barrier-free market. &quot;The anticipated important economic benefits from the single market would be severely restricted if merger activity during the adjustment period increased monopoly power,&quot; the competition report concludes.    Sir Leon says he hopes to win stronger EC powers by the end of this year to stop anti-competitive mergers or acquisitions.    Producers of toxic waste in Europe could be made liable for damages.    An expected EC proposal would make companies responsible for damages caused by their waste. The plan, which one official describes as &quot;revolutionary,&quot; is aimed at preventing the lengthy and often inconclusive legal battles that follow accidents or incidents of contamination. Claimants would still have to prove a link between the company and the waste, but evidence of negligence would no longer be necessary.    The plan, advocated by Environment Commissioner Ripa di Meana, may run into opposition when it goes to EC ministers for approval, although five community governments already have similar rules.    Another hormone ban may spark further trade tensions with the U.S.    An 18-month-to-two-year &quot;moratorium&quot; on use of the controversial new hormone bovine somatotropin, or BST, is expected to be announced soon. The hormone can boost cows' milk production as much as 25%.    Brussels argues that the delay will allow more time for scientific studies on possible health risks. But the U.S. links the BST issue to the EC ban on hormones in meat, and warns the trade bloc against decisions that aren't scientifically justified.    Although the U.S. likely would suffer little or no damage from a BST ban, Washington fears the move could set a dangerous precedent for future technological developments in farming. The U.S. is expected to authorize the hormone soon. </TEXT></DOC>
