Keating Jr. has nothingto say to Congress about his failed Lincoln Savings and LoanAssociation or the estimated $2 billion the collapse will costtaxpayers.   Keating refused to answer questions Tuesday from the HouseBanking Committee, citing his Fifth Amendment protection againstself-incrimination.   The Phoenix, Ariz., millionaire's brief appearance late in theafternoon came after lawmakers sharply criticized M. Danny Wall,the nation's chief thrift regulator. Wall received little sympathyduring 10 hours of testimony in which he denied responsibility forthe cost to taxpayers of the Lincoln bailout.   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, the committee's chairman, hascalled for Wall's resignation and said the regulator's politicalfuture in part depended on his performance before the committee.However, both Democrats and Republicans said they were unimpressedby his response.   ``Somehow it rings very hollow to say the huge regulatorybureaucracy could do nothing, did nothing, as the institution wentdown,'' Gonzalez said.   ``The thrust that I get out of the testimony is `poor DannyWall, too busy to do the job that I have been assigned to do,'''said Rep. Jim Bunning, R-Ky.   The committee has been focusing on why Wall rejected a May 1987recommendation from field examiners in San Francisco that thegovernment seize Lincoln, based in Irvine, Calif., and stop itslosses.   Wall and his two top aides, enforcement director RosemaryStewart and supervision director Darrel Dochow, maintain that theSan Francisco officials never gathered the legal proof needed toshut Lincoln down.   The discrepancies between the testimony from Wall and his aidesand witnesses from earlier hearings was so great that Rep. ChalmersWylie of Ohio, the panel's senior Republican, declared: ``The areasof disagreement are disparate enough that someone has perjuredhimself.''   Before and after his appearance, Keating rebuffed reporters'shouted questions. But, he issued a written statement saying it ispossible he will testify after his legal problems are resolved.   As chairman of Lincoln's parent company, American ContinentalCorp., Keating faces a federal grand jury investigation in LosAngeles. He is the target of a $1.1 billion fraud and racketeeringsuit brought by federal regulators.   Committee aides were hoping that Keating, who has a reputationfor outspokenness, would be unable to resist responding to theprevious torrent of criticism.   But Keating said, ``On the advice of counsel, I respectfullyexercise my constitutional prerogative and privilege ... anddecline to answer questions here today.''   Late in the hearing, Gonzalez revealed that documents examinedby the committee show that on the day before Lincoln was seized bythe government _ April 13, 1989 _ Wall received two telephone callsfrom a Keating associate, Barbara Thomas. She is a former member ofthe Securities and Exchange Commission under President Carter.   Wall said he could remember only that he received the calls andthat Thomas was urging approval of an application to sell Lincoln,which the agency turned down.   Gonzalez pointed out that as the calls were made, AmericanContinental was declaring bankruptcy. Regulators say that actioncomplicates their efforts to reduce the estimated $2 billion costof the failure to taxpayers.   According to committee aides, American Continental made a$250,000 unsecured, three-year loan to Thomas in December 1987.   Gonzalez said he will decide later whether further hearings arenecessary to explore other aspects of the Lincoln disaster.   In a separate development Tuesday, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,wrote the Senate Ethics Committee that he never acted improperly onbehalf of Lincoln although Keating gave him $112,000 in campaignmoney and use of an airplane.   ``I have every confidence that you and the committee willdetermine that there has been no improper conduct on my part andthat you will clear my name,'' McCain wrote Ethics CommitteeChairman Howell Heflin, D-Ala., and Vice Chairman Warren Rudman,R-N.H.   McCain is one of five senators who received campaign money fromKeating and in April 1987 met with regulators to discuss theirsupervision of Lincoln. All five lawmakers have denied wrongdoing,but the Ethics Committee has hired an outside counsel to gatherinformation in the case.</TEXT></DOC>
