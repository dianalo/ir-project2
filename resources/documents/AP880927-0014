Refusing to bow to GOP demands for a broad-based subminimumfloor under the 50-year-old minimum wage, Democratic leaders onMonday gave up all hope of raising the pay base by 40 cents to$3.75 an hour in January.   ``There is no point in our continuing to pound on their door,''Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said on the Senate floor.``I'm now conceding that the Republican filibuster was successful.''   Even before Monday's action, the bill faced an uncertain fate inthe House, where there was intense opposition from some southernand midwestern Democrats.   ``I think it's a pretty good result,'' said Senate Republicanleader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``This bill couldn't pass the House. Itwasn't going to pass the Senate unless it was modified.''   The Senate had been stymied for more than a week byparliamentary maneuvering on both sides as the two presidentialcandidates, Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis,watched from the sidelines.   Lacking the 51 votes to effectively couple an increase withtheir desire for a 90-day, 80 percent subminimum for newly hiredworkers, Republicans refused to allow any votes on the bill itselfor amendments.   Democrats, meanwhile, lacked the 60 votes necessary to limit thedebate and shut off the filibuster despite the defection of eightGOP senators to their cause last Friday.   Each side sought to blame the other, with Democrats maintainingthat Bush could have turned the vote around with a few phone callsto Republican lawmakers.   Bush three weeks ago had said he could support a modest increase_ never specifying how much _ but only if it was coupled with thecreation of a broad subminimum ``training'' wage.   ``Perhaps the word from the vice president's campaign has notgotten through to our friends on the other side,'' Byrd said.``Perhaps it has gotten through. Either way the results areevident. Some 15 million workers are the loser.''   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., wouldhave raised the minimum wage in three annual 40-cents-an-hourincreases to $4.55 by 1991, directly benefiting some 15 millionworkers now paid less than that, according to Kennedy.   Republicans blamed Kennedy's refusal to compromise on a lowerfigure, such as the $4.25 an hour suggested once by Dole or $4 anhour as urged by Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind.   But they said Kennedy's refusal to compromise on the so-calledtraining wage, or the ``youth training wage'' as Quayle called it,overshadowed everything else.   ``The real reason this is being pulled down is that the senatorfrom Massachusetts knows we were on the very edge of passing thetraining wage,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the leader of theRepublican opposition.   ``The fact is that the international trade union movement inthis country will not accept a training wage,'' Hatch said. ``Theyconsider the minimum wage as their single idea.''   Hatch had introduced an amendment calling for the 80 percentsubminimum for the first 90 days a new employee is on a company'spayroll, saying it would ``give a chance to those unskilled,undereducated youths who cannot get into the system any other way.''   To prevent a vote on the amendment, Kennedy immediatelyintroduced a substitute that would slightly expand a currentlyallowed but little-used $2.85 subminimum for full-time studentsworking less than 20 hours a week.   ``If his passes, mine would be gone,'' Hatch said early in thedebate, complaining as did other Republicans that their subminimumproposal was being denied a fair hearing under Senate rules thatfavor whichever party holds a majority.   Kennedy called Hatch's subminimum amendment a ``Bush hire 'emand fire 'em wage.''   Without any requirements for training or age restrictions,employers would have an incentive to replace their workforces every90 days with a new group of workers paid the subminimum rate,Kennedy said.   Republicans had also pushed as an alternative to a minimum wageincrease an earned income tax credit that would have funneled about$6 billion in federal subsidies over four years to families headedby minimum wage earners.   Kennedy said that alternative, which Republicans conceded wouldhave to be financed through a tax increase, would leave taxpayers``subsidizing employers who exploit their workers.''</TEXT></DOC>
