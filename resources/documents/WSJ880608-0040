The new concern, BiiN, will make &quot;computer systems for mission-critical computing applications,&quot; the companies said. Both Intel, a semiconductor maker, and Siemens, a West German electrical products giant, will own 50% of BiiN.    Neither company would disclose details about what products might emerge from the venture, although they said the systems may serve in applications such as on-line transactions and computer-integrated manufacturing. Additional information &quot;will be made available later this year,&quot; they said.    William Zachmann, a senior vice president at International Data Corp., a computer industry market research firm, said he thinks the announcement &quot;means that Intel, along with Siemens, is going into the computer business in a way that will make them competitive with International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Co.&quot;    Joseph J. Kroger, former vice chairman of Unisys Corp., will head the joint venture. BiiN will have its world headquarters in Hillsboro, Ore., site of Intel's systems group, which manufactures single board computers, software and hardware development tools, plug-in boards for personal computers, and networking products. The venture's European headquarters will be in Nuremberg, West Germany. Production at both sites is expected to begin before year end, the companies said.    International Data's Mr. Zachmann said he thinks the new venture will take advantage of Intel's expertise in building microprocessor chips to come up with &quot;parallel processor&quot; computers that employ several microprocessors. Such sophisticated computers can provide the processing power of conventional, room-sized mainframe computers for a fraction of the cost.    Munich-based Siemens is the largest computer maker in Europe, although it doesn't sell those products in the U.S. It also makes computer chips, including microprocessors.    Yesterday's announcement marks the second link Siemens has forged with a Silicon Valley chip manufacturer in a week. Last week, it agreed with Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Advanced Micro Devices Inc. to jointly develop and manufacture microchips for use in communications applications.    Intel closed at $33, down 50 cents, in national over-the-counter trading yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
