The study of data collected by weather stations across thecountry from 1895 to 1987 concluded that while the nation hasexperienced periods of unusual temperature and precipitation, therehas been no trend in one direction or another.   The study, published in the current issue of Geophysical ResearchLetters, does not support the ``rising notion'' that there have beenmajor climatic changes in this country, researcher George Maul ofthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said hereWednesday night.   The findings don't necessarily cast doubt on previous findings ofa worldwide warming trend and have no bearing on thegreenhouse-effect theory that a buildup of carbon dioxide andpollutants is acting like a greenhouse and causing such warming,lead researcher Kirby Hanson said in interviews with The New YorkTimes and the Los Angeles Times.   Hanson, a meteorologist, pointed out that the United Statesoccupies only a small percentage of the Earth's surface, and saidthe new findings may be the result of regional variations.   Last July, James Hansen of the National Aviation and SpaceAdministration's Goddard Institute startled members of Congress whenhe testified that unusually hot conditions, such as last summer'sdrought and rash of wildfires, could be forerunners of thegreenhouse effect.   Hansen said temperatures had risen nearly 1 degree worldwideduring the last century.   He said Wednesday that he had no quarrel with the new study'sfindings.   ``We are just arguing now about whether the global warming effectis large enough to see,'' Hanson said. ``It is not surprising we arenot seeing it in a region (the 48 contiguous states) that coversonly 1.5 percent of the globe.''   Maul said the study indicates scientists need to be cautious inconcluding whether the United States can detect a greenhouse effect.</TEXT></DOC>
