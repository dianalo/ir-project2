Nothing could be fartherfrom the truth,'' said Gary Hubbard, communications director forthe United Steelworkers of America.   ``In a company where you haven't had a strike for awhile,there's nothing to strengthen the union like a good, old-fashioneddonneybrook,'' Hubbard said in a telephone interview fromWashington.   An estimated 57,800 members of the International Association ofMachinists struck Boeing despite a contract offer that exceeds orequals many recent settlements nationwide.   Boeing, which has seen five years of record jetliner orders,offered what it called a reasonable package of raises, bonuses andcost-of-living adjustments that was rejected by a 70 percent vote.   William Whitlow, an aerospace industry analyst with the DainBosworth investment firm in Seattle, said the Boeing strike couldmark a labor turnaround in the industry, where unionism has beenstruggling since President Reagan crushed an air trafficcontrollers strike eight years ago.   ``You might even make the argument it could go beyond theaerospace industry,'' Whitlow said.   ``I think there is a greater militance within the labor movementgenerally,'' said Arnie Winemeister, president of the WesternCouncil of Teamsters.   Dan Bickford, president of the Seattle area's King County LaborCouncil, said his AFL-CIO-affiliated organization had gained 23unions with 12,000 members in the last three years.   ``I think labor is on the upsurge,'' Bickford said. ``I'd alsosay we have more union activism now than we did three or four yearsago.''   He and others said the strike, the first in 12 years against theworld's largest commercial airplane builder, reflects growing unionmilitance that cuts across georgraphic areas and age groups.   ``I think what we are seeing is a period in which unions areemerging from a period of freezes, givebacks and concessions,''said Robert Bonitati, an Air Line Pilots Association veteran whoonce advised Reagan on labor questions.   With an economy that remains resilient after years ofuninterrupted growth, ``people are coming back and saying, `Hey, wewant our piece of the pie.' '' Bonitati said. ``I hate to say it,but (this is somewhat) a return to normalcy, although I don't thinkyou will ever see the level of strikes you once saw.''   It was the second major walkout by machinists this year,following a strike that resulted in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filingby Eastern Airlines.   Boeing has turned to supervisors to complete work on some jetswhile the assembly lines make do without 43,300 union members inthe Seattle area, 12,000 in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore.,and a few hundred at scattered sites in California, Hawaii,Montana, Utah and other states.   Larry Kenney, president of the Washington State Labor Council,said he generally found ``more of a willingness (among unionmembers) to take a hard position'' but was still ``surprised at thestrength of the vote.''   More than half of those voting had been hired since the lastwalkout by Boeing machinists, a 45-day strike in 1977. In Wichita,union officials estimated the figure ran to 95 percent.   ``Of course, many of them (recent hires) come from good unionfamilies,'' said Tom Baker, president of Machinists District Lodge751 in Seattle.   Victor Kamber, head of the Kamber Group, a public affairsconsultant for 30 unions in Washington, attributed a resurgence instrike sentiment to what he called ``a greater militancy among theyounger workers.''   Kamber, whose clients do not include the Machinists, said thatalthough the number of strikes, affected workers and lost hourscontinued to decline, ``we have had a more visible year'' withmajor walkouts against Pittston Coal, Eastern Airlines and severaltelephone companies.   Striking is still a valid tactic, even if it is no longerlabor's primary weapon, he said.   ``Strikes are only going to take place and be successful whereyou can really shut down the company,'' Kamber said.   ``It runs counter to the direction of the overall labor movementthese days, but I have tremendous respect for the ability of theMachinists Union to choose the right time and place to use thatweapon,'' he said.   Bonitati, a Kamber vice president, said he expected strikes tocontinue to decline.   ``I think you see labor leaders looking at it with a great dealof caution,'' Bonitati said. ``I think they will pick morecarefully if they have control ... (and) attempt to use strikes ina very symbolic way and for very strategic purposes.''   Hubbard said the Steelworkers negotiated contracts for more than125,000 workers this year without any major strikes as the metalsindustry recovers from a severe slump earlier in the decade. Atsteelmakers alone, the union's bargaining jurisdiction fell from400,000 jobs in 1980 to 180,000 today.   ``The healthier the industry, the easier it is to resolvecontract disputes,'' Hubbard said.   Noting the record airplane sales, profits and backlog of ordersat Boeing, he said, ``It's tragic that a strike would have to occurin such a well-off industry.''   Bonitati said most recent major strikes had been unsuccessful.   The coal strike ``is inflicting serious, serious damage on thatunion,'' the United Mine Workers, Bonitati said. ``From allindications, it's going to last for a long, long time. It's goingto be a constant drain upon that union's treasury.''</TEXT></DOC>
