Pomerantz, a Texas businessman, with insider trading in the stock of SFN Cos. in 1984.    Mr. Pomerantz, 61 years old, immediately settled the civil charges without admitting or denying guilt. The SEC said he will pay a penalty of $79,850 and will surrender $39,925 in trading profits that he and his mother-in-law allegedly reaped.    Mr. Pomerantz, of Seguin, Texas, couldn't be reached for comment. A spokesman for SFN said the company wasn't aware of the suit and wouldn't comment on it.    The SEC left unclear whose inside information Mr. Pomerantz allegedly exploited. Court papers say only that Mr. Pomerantz was accused of misappropriating confidential information from a person involved in the 1984 acquisition of the Glenview, Ill., publishing and broadcasting company by an investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus andamp; Co.    Harry J. Weiss, an assistant director in the SEC's enforcement division in Washington, said only that the person who gave Mr. Pomerantz the inside information wasn't a &quot;tipster,&quot; but disclosed the information &quot;with the expectation that (Mr. Pomerantz) not use it for trading.&quot;    &quot;It's a misappropriation, not a tip,&quot; Mr. Weiss said. The SEC said the other person wouldn't be charged in the case.    SFN was bought for $423 million by an investor group that included Warburg Pincus; Hallmark Cards Inc.; the securities firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.; and top managers of SFN.    SFN was one of the stocks that figured in the insider-trading case of Dennis B. Levine, a former Drexel managing director. Ilan K. Reich, formerly a lawyer with the firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen andamp; Katz, was charged with passing a tip about the transaction to Mr. Levine, who then traded on the information.    But a source closely familiar with the Pomerantz matter said Mr. Pomerantz's case has &quot;nothing to do with the Levine case&quot; and apparently involved an &quot;innocent&quot; person who didn't believe Mr. Pomerantz would use the information.    The SEC's complaint charged that on Aug. 22, 1984, a day before the investor group announced its bid for SFN, Mr. Pomerantz bought 3,000 shares of SFN at $26.50 to $26.75 a share through four separate accounts. Mr. Pomerantz's mother-in-law bought 2,000 shares at $26.50 each, based on Mr. Pomerantz's recommendation, according to the SEC. Mr. Pomerantz made $23,000 when SFN stock rose on news of the bid; his mother-in-law made $16,000, the SEC said.    Mr. Pomerantz's mother-in-law wasn't charged.    As part of the settlement, Mr. Pomerantz is barred permanently from violating the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Such an injunction allows the government to seek a stiffer penalty than usual if a defendant is accused of breaking the law again.    The SEC said the case was uncovered by the market surveillance operation of the New York Stock Exchange, where SFN common was traded before the buyout. </TEXT></DOC>
