(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nine Mile Point 2 went into permanentcommercial operation Friday after 11 years of delays and costoverruns that have made it the nation's most expensive nuclearplant at a cost of $6.3 billion.   The 1,080-megawatt plant, which was to have been completed in1977 for $423 million, went on line at 3 p.m., providingelectricity to more than 9 million New Yorkers, said Niagara MohawkPower Corp. spokesman William Romano.   It becomes the 105th nuclear plant operating commercially in theUnited States.   ``I feel great,'' said Niagara Mohawk President William Donlon.``It's been a difficult period, it's been difficult on the company.But we did succeed. We did not fail where others have.''   Nine Mile 2, on the Lake Ontario shoreline north of Oswego, willgenerate enough electricity to replace about 6 million to 8 millionbarrels of oil per year, said Romano.   Besides Niagara Mohawk, four other utilities own theboiling-water reactor _ New York State Electric and Gas, LongIsland Lighting Co., Rochester Gas andamp; Electric Corp., and CentralHudson Gas andamp; Electric Corp.   Nine Mile 2, which already has produced 250 million kilowatthours of commercial electricity during testing, will be brought upto 100 percent operating capacity over the next several days,Romano said.   Niagara Mohawk was granted its construction permit for Nine Mile2 in 1974, and began construction a year later. Work was notcompleted until June 1986.   Niagara Mohawk has attributed the cost overruns and delays onupgraded safety standards and plant design changes required by theNRC. Critics have blamed mismanagement, inefficient procurementpractices and union corruption.</TEXT></DOC>
