Joichi Aoi, who became president and chief executive officer two weeks ago after his predecessor's resignation, also told foreign reporters Tuesday that Toshiba remains in the race to obtain a lucrative contract to sell laptop personal computers to the U.S. Defense Department.    &quot;We're determined to make every effort to restore the relationship of trust between Japan and the U.S. that was damaged by this case,&quot; Mr. Aoi said. &quot;We'd like to do whatever we can to contribute to the security of the Western bloc.&quot;    Also Tuesday, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told parliament that export violations by Toshiba's subsidiary, Toshiba Machine Co., were &quot;a grave betrayal of the Japanese people and a violation of national defense.&quot; Mr. Nakasone's public remarks were among his strongest on the Toshiba matter and signaled a conciliatory stance toward the U.S., which has been highly critical of the company.    Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari told a lower-house committee the government acknowledges a causal relationship between the export of Toshiba's computerized milling tools and Soviet capabilities to make quieter submarine propellers. A day earlier, International Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura told the same committee evidence of such a link was inconclusive. Mr. Tamura left for Washington Tuesday to explain Japan's efforts to tighten security controls.    Mr. Aoi reiterated the company's regret over the incident, in which Toshiba Machine allegedly falsified export documentation to ship computerized machine tools to the Soviet Union between 1982 and 1984. He outlined previously announced measures to install internal controls to prevent a recurrence of the export, which violated regulations on the transfer of technology to communist nations.    He also said the company, which faces a potentially disastrous trade ban from the U.S. Congress, intends to push ahead with business as usual. The Senate has approved a ban on Toshiba exports to the U.S. for two to five years; the bill hasn't come up in the House.    Mr. Aoi said Toshiba would pursue a role in the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, or SDI project. The SDI program, commonly referred to as Star Wars, is a space-based anti-missile defense system proposed by President Reagan. But the Toshiba president wouldn't comment on a report that talks between Toshiba and LTV Corp. of the U.S. for a subcontracting relationship in the SDI project had fallen through after the Toshiba Machine case came to light.    He did dismiss reports that the Pentagon was removing Toshiba from bidding on an estimated $100 million contract to supply laptop computers. He said Pentagon officials recently contacted the company to ask it to guarantee that it could produce the machines in the U.S.    Imported computers would be subject to the 100% tariff the U.S. slapped on selected Japanese products earlier this year to retaliate for Japanese failure to comply with a semiconductor trade agreement. Local production would skirt the tariffs.    In a related development, Wako Koeki Co. confirmed Tuesday that the president of the small trading company had resigned to take responsibility for the Toshiba Machine case. Wako Koeki, which specializes in trade with communist countries, initiated the transaction with the Soviet company Techmashimport and provided support services in Moscow.    Meanwhile, Atsushi Iwai, director of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's strategic export control office, said authorities were looking into Wako Koeki's involvement in the export of semiconductor-production parts to the Soviet Union a year ago. </TEXT></DOC>
