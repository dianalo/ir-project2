On the third day of Senate Judiciary Committee hearings onhis nomination to the Supreme Court, Judge Thomas criticizedrecent Supreme Court opinions upholding the constitutionalityof the federal independent-counsel law and some forms ofvoluntary government affirmative action.</LP><TEXT>   He also endorsed, with some qualification, the legalstandard the high court has used since 1971 for determiningthe propriety under the First Amendment of government supportfor religion. That standard, now criticized by severaljustices and the Bush administration, will be the focus of aclosely watched case scheduled to be heard by the high courtin November.   Despite his inclination to comment on these hotly debatedconstitutional issues, however, Judge Thomas steadfastlyrefused to discuss Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 case in which theSupreme Court recognized a woman's constitutional right to anabortion.   Expressing increasing frustration, some Democraticsenators accused the nominee of evasiveness. They alsoscolded him for having been coached by White House lawyersand not wanting to discuss that preparation.   But it appeared increasingly unlikely that thesecomplaints, and others, would coalesce into a seriouscampaign to defeat the 43-year-old nominee, who sits on thefederal appeals court in Washington and hopes to fill theseat vacated by the resignation of Justice Thurgood Marshall.After a morning of sometimes heated interrogation, thequestioning grew desultory as the afternoon wore on.   &quot;I wish he were more candid; I think he hasn't been,&quot; Sen.Herb Kohl (D., Wis.) said in an interview after questioningJudge Thomas. But the lawmaker said he didn't know whetherthis alleged lack of candor would prompt him or others tooppose President Bush's nominee. Sen. Kohl suggested thatJudge Thomas's guardedness and seeming adherence to a scriptmay be an inevitable &quot;part of the nomination process, the wayit's done now.&quot;   Republicans on the committee spent much of their questiontime yesterday delivering speeches, commending Judge Thomason his accomplishments, including his tenure as chairman ofthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during the 1980s.Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch accused Democrats of persecuting thenominee on Roe vs. Wade. &quot;What are we going to have, 64,000questions on abortion?&quot; he asked.   After being asked dozens of times about Roe vs. Wade, themost Judge Thomas would say was that he recognized the strongemotions on both sides of the abortion debate and that, ifconfirmed, he would keep an open mind on abortion cases thatcame before the Supreme Court.   He was more forthcoming on other contentiousconstitutional issues. Judge Thomas said he has &quot;no quarrel&quot;with the existing constitutional test for whether governmentsupport or sponsorship of religion is permissible under theFirst Amendment's ban on official &quot;establishment ofreligion.&quot; The three-part test, enunciated in the 1971 caseof Lemon vs. Kurtzman, allows government support if it isaimed at a secular purpose, if its primary effect neitheradvances nor restricts religion, and if it doesn't lead togovernment &quot;entanglement&quot; with religion.   In response to questions from Democrats, Judge Thomas wentfurther, observing that the Supreme Court has split in recentyears over how to apply the Lemon test and whether to abandonit for one that would allow more interaction betweengovernment and religion. Sens. Kohl and Edward Kennedy (D.,Mass.) objected that the nominee would discuss the Lemon testbut refused to comment on the constitutional analysis ofstate laws restricting abortion. Judge Thomas would say onlythat &quot;prejudging&quot; the abortion issue would &quot;undermine&quot; hisimpartiality.   Judge Thomas, in answers to questions put by Sen. Kennedy,defended his past criticism of two other Supreme Court cases.One case was a 1988 decision upholding Congress'sauthorization of the appointment of independent counsels toinvestigate and prosecute high government officials. Theother was a 1987 decision upholding a voluntaryaffirmative-action hiring policy of a county agency thatresulted in the hiring of a woman rather than a man who hadscored slightly better on a job test.   In a 1988 speech, the nominee called the independentcounsel decision &quot;the most important court case since Brownvs. Board of Education,&quot; the 1954 decision that condemnedsegregated schools as inherently unequal and thusunconstitutional. Yesterday, Judge Thomas criticized theindependent counsel decision because it authorized judicialappointment of prosecutors who he contended aren't&quot;responsible&quot; to any of the three branches of government.Such prosecutors &quot;could undermine the freedom&quot; of theofficials they investigate, Judge Thomas testified.   Discussing the 1987 affirmative action case, he said theSupreme Court's majority improperly allowed reversediscrimination against the male job applicant. Under theapplicable federal statute, &quot;discrimination is wrong on anybasis,&quot; he said.   The nominee readily acknowledged that both the independentcounsel and affirmative action cases are &quot;the law of theland.&quot;   In other testimony, Judge Thomas said the Supreme Courthadn't displayed inappropriate &quot;activism&quot; in its Miranda andexclusionary-rule decisions. The 1966 case of Miranda vs.Arizona required that criminal suspects in custody beinformed of their right to remain silent and have a lawyer.The exclusionary rule, first imposed to a limited degree in1914, bars the admission in court of illegally seizedevidence. Conservatives frequently attack both landmarks ofcriminal procedure as examples of judicial overreaching.   Judge Thomas is expected to give at least one more day oftestimony. He will be followed by witnesses supporting andopposing his nomination.   ---   Scott Woolley contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
