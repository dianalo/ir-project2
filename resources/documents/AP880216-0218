Ashton-Tate Corp. is to unveil a vastly improved version o itsD-Base software, the dominant program for managing informationstored in personal computers.   D-Base IV is capable of running under the new ``traffic cop,''Operating System-2, the state-of-the-art software for directingtraffic inside a personal computer.   Separately, Compaq is to announce Wednesday it is beginningdeliveries of Operating System-2 for use in Compaq personalcomputers.   The announcements mark the growing acceptance of OperatingSystem-2 since its announcement last April by Microsoft Corp. Thesoftware allows computers to run several jobs at the same time andto handle bigger programs than can be handled by its predecessor,MS-DOS.   OS-2 will supersede MS-DOS as the operating system of choice bythe end of 1990, with 3.7 million copies shipped that year vs. 1.5million copies of MS-DOS, Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge,Mass., predicted recently.   Ashton-Tate's D-Base IV should help the Torrance, Calif.-basedcompany against challengers such as Borland International Inc.,Microrim Inc. and Oracle Corp., according to analysts who gotpreviews of the product.   ``This product is a major advance over D-Base III Plus in almostevery dimension,'' Edward M. Esber Jr., chairman and chiefexecutive, said in an interview Tuesday.   Ashton-Tate had more than 60 percent of sales of data-basemanagers for personal computers last year, the company says.   Houston-based Compaq is highlighting the ability of itscomputers to run Operating System-2 as part of a public-relationsbattle with International Business Machines Corp., which says itsnew Personal System-2 computers are best suited to run OS-2.   Compaq is to have 21 independent software developers _ includingAshton-Tate _ at an industry forum, commenting on their plans forprograms that will take advantage of OS-2's features.   Compaq intends to demonstrate that Operating System-2 runsfaster on Compaq computers than on IBM computers, although IBM wasinvolved in OS-2's development, Michael Swavely, Compaq's vicepresident of marketing, said in an interview Tuesday.   The new version of Ashton-Tate's D-Base features a redesignedlook known as ``what you see is what you get'' and spares computernovices from having to do any programming to enter or retrieveinformation from the computer.   For advanced users, a new programming language includes 245 newor improved commands and incorporates the industry-standardStructured Query Language created by International BusinessMachines Corp.   In addition to running under the new Operating System-2, D-BaseIV can also run under Microsoft's older MS-DOS, which is still theone used on most personal computers.   D-Base IV includes a compiler that allows it to run 10 times asfast as D-Base III Plus, Ashton-Tate said. The compiler reduces theinstructions in a program to a machine language that a computer canread rapidly.   Esber said the new version contains about 400,000 lines ofprogramming code vs. 106,000 in D-Base III Plus.   The price is $795, up from $695 for D-Base III Plus. CurrentD-Base users can buy upgrades to D-Base IV for $175.   Esber said the program was being announced early because thecompany will be showing it in a national tour led by IBM thatbegins next week.   Some of Ashton-Tate's competitors have stumbled in efforts tobeat the company to the market with data-base managers that workwith Operating System-2.   Borland and Oracle have failed to meet their own deadlines fordata-base managers that run under Operating System-2. However, theymay still beat Ashton-Tate to market, because Esber said D-Base IVmight not be available until the end of July.</TEXT></DOC>
