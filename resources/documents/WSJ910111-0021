A majority of House and Senate Democrats oppose war atthis juncture, but President Bush appears to have sufficientstrength to prevail in a series of votes expected toculminate tomorrow. In White House meetings and telephonecalls, Mr. Bush worked yesterday to solidify his base amongSouthern conservatives, and his allies in the House sought tomaximize his leverage by pressing for a joint resolution,which would have the effect of law, rather than a weakerresolution that would merely express lawmakers' sentiment.</LP><TEXT>   The resolution introduced yesterday would give thepresident broad discretion to commit U.S. forces to combat inpursuit of goals set by the United Nations Security Council-- including Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. The measure wouldrequire Mr. Bush first to conclude that diplomatic and &quot;otherpeaceful means to obtain compliance&quot; have been exhausted orare ineffective, but the president would have wide latitudein making such a determination.   A critical issue is the impact of the current economicembargo against Iraq. The resolution would require that Mr.Bush determine that &quot;these efforts have not been and wouldnot be successful&quot; in forcing Iraq's withdrawal. To fortifythe administration's growing inclination to use force, theHouse Armed Services Committee yesterday released a letterfrom Central Intelligence Agency Director William Websterarguing that sanctions won't be sufficient.   In his letter, CIA Director Webster said the embargo isworking economically, but that there isn't any evidence itwill have enough political or military impact to force awithdrawal from Kuwait.   &quot;Our judgment remains that, even if the sanctions continueto be enforced for another six to 12 months, economichardship alone is unlikely to compel Saddam to retreat fromKuwait or cause regime-threatening popular discontent inIraq,&quot; he wrote. The conclusion was similar to one he offeredin testimony in December.   The intelligence chief conceded in his letter thatsanctions would degrade Iraq's military over the next year.But he said the greatest impact would be on Iraq's air forceand its air defense, and would have &quot;only a marginal impacton Saddam's ability to hold Kuwait.&quot; Ground forces would befar less affected, he wrote, and they could compensate forany harm by using the added months to improve their defenses.   CIA officials are expected to brief senators on thesanctions issue today.   Republicans hope to pick up as many as 80 Democratic votesin the House, but the sanctions issue may be more of astumbling block for the administration in the Senate, where aresolution authorizing force still faces resistance fromconservative chairmen of the Intelligence and Armed Servicescommittees. Although the president is expected to prevail,his margin in the Senate will be narrower. SenateRepublicans, who are scheduled to caucus this morning, havebeen reluctant to go public yet with the precise wording ofthe resolution they will offer.   Meanwhile, there was a surge of diplomatic activity byFrance and the U.N., but there was no immediate sign thediplomacy would succeed.   France, working with Algeria, continued to push the ideaof promising an international conference on the Palestinianissue and other Middle East problems in return for an Iraqiwithdrawal from Kuwait. French Defense Minister Jean-PierreChevenment urged the U.S. to make &quot;a little gesture&quot; towardIraq to allow him to pull his troops out of Kuwait.   President Bush has firmly rejected such &quot;linkage&quot; betweenKuwait and the Palestinian issue, saying that drawing aconnection would amount to rewarding Iraq for its invasion ofKuwait. And France publicly reasserted that it is prepared tojoin a military drive to force Iraq out of Kuwait if SaddamHussein hasn't withdrawn his forces by the Jan. 15 deadlineset by the U.N. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwaterdeclared, &quot;We believe that should we have to act, France willbe with us.&quot; Separately, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perezde Cuellar was preparing for a meeting tomorrow with Iraqiofficials in Baghdad. Iraq has welcomed his visit. Somereports suggested Mr. Perez de Cuellar will explore the ideaof a phased withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait inconjunction with a pullout of foreign forces from SaudiArabia.   Mr. Perez de Cuellar plans to meet today in Geneva withforeign ministers of the 12-nation European Community todiscuss the U.N. diplomatic drive. But while France pledgedto continue its push for a diplomatic solution, other ECnations are losing hope of launching a peace initiative. Iraqhas rejected the EC's offer to have its foreign ministersmeet Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in Algiers. The Iraqigovernment insists that the meeting be held in Baghdad. TheEC, under pressure from the U.S. not to move ahead ofWashington's diplomacy, has declined to send its foreignministers there.   In Congress, the House and Senate Democratic leadershiphave proposed alternative resolutions that would favorcontinuing the embargo strategy against Iraq, rather thanauthorizing use of force. These resolutions would preservethe option of using force in the future, but they wouldrequire Mr. Bush to come back for approval from Congressbefore ordering military action.   The divisions among lawmakers have a partisan cast, butthey demonstrate strikingly that old attitudes have changedamong Democrats and Republicans and their constituents. &quot;Ifind hawks who are doves, and doves who are hawks,&quot; saidDemocratic Rep. Gene Taylor, describing voters in hisdistrict on the Mississippi coast. &quot;I have a Korean Warveteran and former POW who are against the war, and I have anEpiscopalian minister who wants to bomb Baghdad, and Ithought his business was peace.&quot;   Rep. James Leach, a liberal Republican from Iowa and aclose ally of the president, expressed frustration thatDemocrats aren't more supportive of Mr. Bush's efforts towork within a U.N. framework. &quot;The conservative tradition ofthis century is isolationism or go-it-alone like Reagan,&quot;said Mr. Leach. &quot;Bush has stepped forthrightly into theWilson-Roosevelt tradition, and the Democrats aren't backinghim.&quot;   By comparison, Democrats are finding that resistance to aPersian Gulf war often comes from more conservativeconstituents and from the same working-class families whowere willing to support wars against communism in Vietnam andKorea. &quot;The opposition is particularly intense among workingfamilies,&quot; said Rep. Edward Feighan (D., Ohio).   Lawmakers are finding some voters confused over thepurpose of the U.S. commitment and resentful of the costs.&quot;There doesn't seem to be a focus or moral imperative withpeople,&quot; said Rep. Paul Kanjorski (D., Pa.). &quot;Their new worldorder isn't Bush's. Their new world order is that there aremany industrial nations that must be made to share the costof maintaining peace.&quot;   The debate and threat of war in the Mideast may be mostsensitive for pro-Israel lawmakers. Prominent congressionalbackers of Israel from the Northeast and California havetaken a lead role in backing the administration's policy, butIsrael's supporters are divided. &quot;The case has not been madefor war now,&quot; said Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Cal.).   Some pro-Israel groups worry that Israel's long-terminterests in Washington could be hurt if they take too high aprofile in the Gulf debate. Rep. Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.), aWhite House ally, met resistance when he asked the AmericanIsrael Public Affairs Committee to become more active onbehalf of the president. The Conference of Presidents ofMajor American Jewish Organizations issued a statement thisweek supportive of the administration's resolution, but itisn't a lobbying group seeking to directly influenceCongress.   &quot;We are a little concerned about this being perceived as aJewish issue,&quot; said Rabbi David Saperstein of the ReformJewish Movement. Still, the debate touches a deep chord inthe community. &quot;For Jews it is as much the resonance of WorldWar II as it is Israel,&quot; Rabbi Saperstein said.   The stalemate this week in Geneva served to strengthen thepresident's hand in the congressional debate, and Republicanconservatives have fallen into line despite theirsensititivity about references to the U.N. Rep. Toby Roth(R., Wis.) was a major critic of the decision to send theU.S. Marine peacekeeping force to Lebanon in the early 1980s,but he has embraced the president's position now, in what hecalls an effort to &quot;avert war.&quot;   A veteran of World War II, Minority Leader Robert Michelwas blunt and emotional in his own remarks. &quot;Let no one inthis chamber lecture me on the horrors of war,&quot; said theIllinois Republican. &quot;When patience and delay become foreignpolicy goals by themselves . . . then they are no longervirtues.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
