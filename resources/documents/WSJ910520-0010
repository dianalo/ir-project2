Mr. Stanislaw is the co-author of a new study tobe released shortly by the Cambridge, Mass., firm onprospects for increased coordination of oil policies byproducing and consuming nations.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. and Britain remain cool to the so-calledproducer-consumer dialogue on oil on the grounds it mayinterfere with free-market forces. Still, several meetingsthat could set the stage for closer relationships andplanning between oil producers and consumers will take placeover the next few weeks.   Mr. Stanislaw doesn't expect any immediate results, butsaid the meetings themselves are likely to influenceoil-market psychology and behavior this spring. The prospectof coordinated planning between oil producers and consumerscould smooth out some price volatility.   One of the meetings will begin May 27 in Isfahan, Iran.The three-day conference is to be sponsored by Iran's foreignministry and by National Iranian Oil Co. Some see it as asignal of Iran's expanding position in world oil markets andthe more moderate role it may adopt in the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries.   Iranian officials call the conference &quot;a step towardfashioning and promoting understanding among major players --producers, consumers and oil companies -- in the energyscene.&quot; It is expected to draw more than 100 oil experts,including the energy ministers and other representatives of anumber of oil-consuming and producing countries. Several oilministers from other OPEC nations, including Hisham Nazer ofSaudi Arabia, will speak.   Though there is no direct link, the Iranian conferencewill be sandwiched between two meetings of the InternationalEnergy Agency that also have the subject of an oilproducer-consumer dialogue on their agenda. The first IEAmeeting, May 24, is of its governing board. That will befollowed by a June 3 ministerial meeting of the Paris-basedIEA, which represents the West's major oil-consuming nations.   One issue to be resolved by the IEA is how to reply toOPEC's recommendations of a producer-consumer dialogue.During the Persian Gulf crisis, OPEC and its president wereemphatic in urging such talks. On June 4, a day after the IEAministerial meeting, the oil ministers begin their midyearmeeting at which they will discuss the IEA's response, ifany, on the subject of producer-consumer talks.   The U.S. and Britain are important members of the IEA. Theagency previously has rejected overtures toward coordinatingoil supply and demand plans because of hints of manipulationof production and prices that could involve. &quot;Multilateraldiscussions involving OPEC on one side of the table wouldimply acceptance by the other party or parties of the pricingrole that OPEC sets for itself as a fundamental objective,&quot;says the Cambridge Energy report.   But Mr. Stanislaw, formerly the IEA's senior economist,suggests France's new membership in the group could tilt thescales slightly in the direction of oil-consuming nationsthat favor talks with the producers. France already hasjoined Venezuela in proposing a meeting of petroleumproducing and consuming countries.   Venezuelan officials confirmed in Caracas this week thatthe meeting will take place in Paris July 3-8. In a recentinterview, Venezuela's President Carlos Andres Perez, said 10to 12 countries will take part in the Paris meeting.   The U.S. isn't likely to be among the participants.&quot;President Bush is not in favor of the dialogue,&quot; Mr. Perezsaid in the interview. Still, he says, the French-Venezuelanproposal &quot;does not seek to regulate the market but rather tocreate a framework of understanding to bring about astabilization of prices.&quot;   Even if it shuns multilateral discussions with the OPECnations, the U.S. does try to maintain close links withindividual oil-producing countries on a bilateral basis. Forexample, Mr. Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, was in Washingtonearly this week to meet with U.S. Energy Secretary JamesWatkins. Neither would confirm the topic of their talks, butindustry reports focus on previous discussions regardingpossible &quot;leasing&quot; of Saudi oil by the U.S. for its StrategicPetroleum Reserve.   &quot;I believe these bilateral discussions between the U.S.and Saudi Arabia on the SPR are taking place and areproceeding slowly but satisfactorily,&quot; said LawrenceGoldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry ResearchFoundation.</TEXT></DOC>
