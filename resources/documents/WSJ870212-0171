Mr. Shilling misses the fundamental point of lowering tax rates when he confuses the impact such reductions will have in motivating corporate cost savings in order to increase after-tax profits with a reduction in compensation for employees because higher tax-deductible costs have resulted from lower tax rates.    Lower tax rates ensure a greater conservation of economic resources because a larger portion of any savings in tax-deductible costs can be retained by the corporation that realizes them. When the burden of costs falls on someone other than those who incur them, either partially through taxation or totally in the form of third-party payments, it is a virtual certainty that higher costs and waste will result. Lowering tax rates does not increase total tax-deductible costs, but will cause a higher percentage of any reduction in tax-deductible costs to accrue to the corporate cost saver, rather than to be surrendered to the government in higher taxes.    It is this feature, appealing to the self-interest of corporations to be more cost efficient because they will be able to retain a greater share of their cost savings, that makes lower tax rates a desirable economic policy for a free society.    Such private-property incentives contribute to the very essence of a free-market process as individuals and corporations efficiently utilize their scarce economic resources for the benefit of consumers. Mr. Shilling's presumption that increased incentives to save labor costs will harmfully reduce employee compensation ignores the great economic wisdom of Adam Smith that &quot;the sole end of productive activity is consumption,&quot; and efficient work effort is certainly a necessary means to achieving that end.    Far from increasing &quot;tax-deductible costs,&quot; real reductions in tax rates enhance private-ownership incentives and accountability by permitting the individual to retain more of his property. From this additional source of private property comes the savings for tomorrow's productive investments and the greater prosperity that follows.    Robert G. Anderson   Executive Secretary   Foundation for Economic Education    Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y.   ---   Mr. Shilling seems to be looking at only one side of the equation regarding the net after-tax cost to an employer of a $100,000 executive. Granted, the after-tax cost of the executive will rise from $54,000 to $66,000 under the new law. But assuming that such an executive will generate on average $200,000 of gross income for his employer, under both old and new tax laws, then the net after-tax profit of employing him will increase from $54,000 a year to $66,000. Corporations that blindly slash compensation on the basis of incremental after-tax costs without reference to executive profit generation will end up with lessened profits.
