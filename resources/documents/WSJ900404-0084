According to some predictions, the contentiousdeliberations could take months, leaving the issue unresolveduntil the politically charged days before the Novemberelections. Already it's possible to detect some of theimportant differences between the two houses:                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   CARS: There's disagreement over how fast to require aninitial round of cuts in tailpipe emissions and how to decidewhether to require a second round. The first round, estimatedto add $100 to the price of a car, would take effect earlierunder the Senate bill than under the leading House proposal.There also are different triggers for determining when asecond round, estimated to add $500 to the price, kicks in.                                                                                                          FUELS: Even though both houses are tilting towardreformulated gasoline, there are likely to be differencesover how clean the fuel must be and over how widely torequire its use.                                                                                                          SMOG: The chief difference now appears to be over howstrong a federal role to require in forcing states and citiesto clean up their air -- a major issue for environmentalistsand state and local groups. The leading House proposal wouldrequire the federal government to impose clean-up plans onareas that fail to come up with them on their own; the Senatebill would leave full responsibility with the states.Smoggier cities also would be required to take harsher stepsthan cleaner ones under the House plan, including applyingcontrols to smaller polluters.                                                                                                          TOXIC EMISSIONS: To date, the Senate and House arepursuing different techniques for eliminating remainingcancer risks from factories after they've installed the bestavailable anti-pollution technology. Environmentalists thinkthe Senate approach sets too weak a health standard.Yesterday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted toadopt an approach for the remaining risks that is similar toexisting law, requiring the EPA to establish health-basedstandards that provide an &quot;ample margin of safety&quot; to themaximum exposed individual.                                                                                                          UTILITIES: Power plants would have to make requiredreductions in sulfur dioxide sooner under the Senate plan.The Senate gives extra tradable credits to the dirtiestMidwest utilities that bear the heaviest costs and toutilities across the country that need to be able to expandto meet rising electricity demands. The plan also givesdouble the usual credits to utilities that install scrubbers,rather than switching to low-sulfur coal.   The House committee may consider similar changes when ittakes up the subject of acid rain this week.</TEXT></DOC>
