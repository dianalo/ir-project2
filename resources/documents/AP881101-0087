State Family Commission Minister Peng Peiyun said the goal ofholding the number of people in the world's most populous nation to1.2 billion at the turn of the century no longer seems realistic,the official China Daily reported today.   Peng is the highest-ranking official to acknowledge that thetarget set in the 1980s will not be achieved, although otherChinese demographers have estimated the population in the year 2000will be between 1.25 and 1.28 billion.   China now has about 1.08 billion people.   Since the beginning of this decade, family planners have triedto curb population growth by advocating that each family have onlyone child and promoting the use of contraceptives and abortion.   The natural growth rate reached a low of 1.1 percent in 1985 butclimbed to 1.4 percent in 1986 and 1.6 percent last year, a resultof rural opposition to the one-child policy and a second-generationbaby boom as people born in a population surge in the early 1960sbegin raising families.   Peng said that although 78 percent of all couples usecontraceptives, only 18 percent _ 32.3 million couples _ say theywant only one child.   She said more than half of families have two or more childrenand rural couples whose first child is a girl now are allowed tohave a second baby. Ethnic minorities, which make up about 6percent of the population, also are permitted two or more children.   The government has made a concession for peasant families whosefirst baby is a girl because of the strong desire for boys to helpwork the land and carry on the family name.   Newly affluent farmers frequently pay large fines for having twoor more children until they produce a male heir.   Peng said the government will not use force to carry out itsfamily planning policy.</TEXT></DOC>
