Gorbachev and PresidentFrancois Mitterrand appealed today for an immediate cease-fire inLebanon and an end to arms deliveries to Lebanese groups involved inthe conflict.   In a statement after two days of talks, the leaders said theysupported attempts by the Arab League to settle the Lebanese civilwar but also said their countries were available to help with otherefforts to reach a peaceful settlement ``notably in the framework ofthe United Nations Security Council.''   France and the Soviet Union are among the five permanent membersof the Security Council.   The statement said Gorbachev and Mitterrand ``are convinced thatLebanon must remain sovereign, independent, united, with itsterritorial integrity respected.''   It said they ``called for an immediate cease-fire, rigorouslyrespected, as an indispensable condition for the establishment of aconstructive inter-Lebanese dialogue, aiming at nationalreconciliation and peaceful building of a country founded on abalance of the interests of all Lebanese communities.''   The 14-year-old civil war in Lebanon, a former French possession,has pitted Christians against Moslems and Druse militias. Since thelatest outbreak of fighting in March, Druse forces and Syrian troopsin Lebanon have battled the Christian army of Gen. Michel Aoun. Aounhas demanded the withdrawal of the Syrians, in Lebanon under a 1976peacekeeping mandate.   The Soviet Union is the main arms supplier for Syria as well asIraq, which has been arming the Christian forces.   The statement followed Gorbachev's meeting with Frenchintellectuals and students at the Sorbonne in which he challengedthem to help create a new, more peaceful world.   Seated in a red velvet chair in the packed Sorbonne amphitheatre,Gorbachev said the new Soviet political and economic system he isfashioning would be ``a fusion of socialism and democracy.''   ``It's more difficult than we thought at the beginning, but it'sworking. The country is changing, rapidly and irriversibly,'' hesaid, speaking through a translator to an audience of 2,000 thatincluded philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy and Regis Debray, a formerpresidential adviser and author.   Members of the Soviet delegation earlier this week said the visitto the Sorbonne, the University of Paris founded in the 12thcentury, would underline a new understanding between France and theSoviet Union.   For the last decade, French intellectuals, many of them formerleftists, have condemned communist totalitarian regimes since thepublication of Alexander Solzhenitsyn ``Gulag Archipelego.''   Gorbachev called for protecting the global environment, haltingmoral decline and for cooperation between ``men of culture, scienceand art in France and the Soviet Union'' to solve the political andsocial problems of the time.   Gorbachev began the second day of his visit to France by laying awreath on the tomb of France's unknown soldier beneath the Arc deTriomphe and paying a call on Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac.   At a state dinner Tuesday, the first day of his three-day visit,the Soviet president declared his readiness to defend human rightsand called for a united Europe, for moving beyond the East-Westschism that grew from the Cold War.   ``The postwar period is over,'' Gorbachev said at the galadinner. ``Today, a way toward a stable peace is opening before us,based not on a balance of forces, but on a balance of real andcorrectly understood interests.''   On Tuesday, the Soviet president met with Mitterrand and thenvisited the Place de la Bastille, where 200 years ago this month anangry mob stormed the prison and launched the French Revolution,which swept away the French monarchy.   In his dinner toast, Gorbachev said the Soviets feel likeparticipants in this month's festivities celebrating the FrenchRevolution's Bicentennial in part ``because perestroika, also, is arevolution.''   Perestroika, or restructuring, is the name given to Gorbachev's4-year-old drive to revamp Soviet society and economy. In hisremarks, the 58-year-old leader noted that perestroika also includesa keener understanding of the importance of human rights, long anirritant in East-West relations.   Since Gorbachev became Soviet leader in March 1985, he hasrepudiated the vast apparatus of state terror put in place bydictator Josef Stalin.   He has also allowed wider expression of dissenting views,including public challenges to the monopoly on power held by theruling Communist Party.   He told Mitterrand that, like France, the Soviet Union is nowready to defend the rights of ``individuals and entire nations.''</TEXT></DOC>
