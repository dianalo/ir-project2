Their hometown, meanwhile,prepared a homecoming celebration.   The long journey home took Marie-Laure Betille, 7, and her sisterVirginie, 6, by boat from Lebanon to Libya, where they were turnedover to French officials and flown to France late Thursday.   Their hometown of Ollioules, near Toulon, set up welcomingbanners and French flags on its streets today. Mayor Rene Arnaudsaid the town would give the girls a belated Christmas celebration.   Left behind in the hands of Abu Nidal's Fatah RevolutionaryCouncil, a Palestinian guerrilla organization, was their mother,Jacqueline Valente; a baby sister born in captivity; and fiveBelgians also seized aboard the yacht Silco off Israel's occupiedGaza Strip.   Their captors, who have been blamed for numerous terroristattacks, said the girls' freedom was a gift to France from thechildren of the yearlong Palestinian uprising in theIsraeli-occupied territories.   French newspapers today suggested the release was a propagandaploy by Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi to improve his image at atime when the U.S. government has raised concerns about an allegedchemical weapons plant in Libya. The Palestinian kidnappers arebacked by Libya.   Marie-Laure, Virginie and their father, Pascal Betille, arrivedin a French government plane at a secluded military base nearMarseille, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said. They were then takento a hospital for checkups and then to a secret location for sleep.   The girls, dressed in dark robes, their shoulders draped withplaid Arab scarves, had been reunited with their father hoursearlier in the Libyan capital of Tripoli.   Betille's lawyer, Yves Massiani, said Thursday night that thechildren had said nothing of their detention, ``talking only oftheir boat trip.''   Gadhafi called for the girls' release on Christmas Eve, and ontwo occasions they were reported freed and en route home. ThePalestinian group has ties to Libya.   ``France ... welcomes this humanitarian gesture in appropriatemeasure,'' the Foreign Ministry said. ``It thanks foreignauthorities who contributed,'' it added without elaboration.   A statement in Beirut by Fatah-Revolutionary Council spokesmanWalid Khaled said the girls' release was ``a gift to the Frenchauthorities ... in the name of the children of Palestine, thechildren of the Revolution of the Stones on the occasion ofChristmas and New Year.''   Khaled said Saturday the girls would be freed following a callfrom Gadhafi. In the following days, he said they were en route home.   But when there was no sign of the children, the initial suspenseturned to confusion and despair for relatives who spent theChristmas weekend in Beirut seeking the children's release.   There was no immediate comment from the children's relativesabout their arrival.   A later dispatch by the official Libyan news agency reported acall from Gadhafi to ``liberation movements'' to free all hostages.   ``Once again, I ask the Fatah-Revolutionary Council and the restof the liberation movements in the Middle East to respond to myappeal for the release of the remaining hostages on this holyoccasion,'' JANA quoted him as saying. ``Holy occasion'' wasapparently a reference to Christmas.   Fatah-Revolutionary Council announced the capture of the hostagesin a yacht off the Gaza Strip on Nov. 8, 1987. It accused thecaptives of spying for Israel, a charge Israel and the family hasdenied.   The group has been blamed for dozens of hijackings, bombings andassassinations since it broke with PLO chief Yasser Arafat in 1976.   Ms. Valente, who is separated from the father of Marie-Laure andVirginie, gave birth to a third child in captivity and said in arecent videotape that she is pregnant again.   The case is considered unrelated to the 15 Westerners heldhostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian factions.</TEXT></DOC>
