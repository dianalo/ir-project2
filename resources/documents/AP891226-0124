(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Blustery cold weather and highupper-level winds Tuesday forced Martin Marietta Corp. to postponeits first commercial rocket launch for a sixth time.   Wednesday's scheduled launch of the Titan 3, with British andJapanese communications satellites aboard, has been rescheduled to7:05 p.m. EST Thursday, said Martin Marietta spokesman Robert V.Gordon.   ``Air currents in the upper atmosphere are too strong'' andrecent near-freezing temperatures were too low for the Titan 3 tobe launched safely, Gordon said.   Wednesday's lows for the Cape Canaveral area were expected to bein the 40s, which would chill the Titan 3's solid fuel boosters tolevels that are unacceptable for launching. Temperatures ``need tobe in the 60s,'' he said.   The rocket will carry Skynet 4A, a satellite for the BritishDefense Ministry, and JCSAT-2, a satellite for the JapaneseSatellite Communications Co.   Martin Marietta has been trying to launch the Titan 3 since Dec.7. The company's foray into the highly competitive internationalcommercial space business has been delayed four times due to badweather and once because of a computer software problem.</TEXT></DOC>
