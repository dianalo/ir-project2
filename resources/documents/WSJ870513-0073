The Democrat-controlled House, working on amendments to the defense authorization bill, voted 219-199 to cut the president's controversial missile defense system below the $3.6 billion level authorized by its own Armed Services Committee. The Senate Armed Services panel approved $4.5 billion for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; program.    Pentagon officials have warned that the level approved by the House panel would dash hopes of an early deployment of the Star Wars system. Yesterday, the House, underlining its anti-Star Wars feeling, voted 301-122 against an amendment offered by Rep. Jack Kemp (R., N.Y.) that would have required the Defense Department to initiate full-scale testing and deployment with a goal of putting Star Wars into operation by 1993.    Rep. Kemp, a presidential aspirant, has made Star Wars a central campaign theme, and in yesterday's debate on the House floor, he outlined the issue in stark terms. &quot;No U.S. city today has any defense, and that to me is immoral,&quot; he said.    Democrats, however, questioned both the wisdom of pursuing such a system and the nation's ability it deploy it. &quot;The technology is not in hand to do the kind of thing Mr. Kemp's talking about,&quot; said Rep. Norm Dicks (D., Wash.).    The House also approved, in a 229-187 roll call, an amendment that would prohibit foreign companies or governments from receiving SDI contracts unless the Pentagon certifies that the work can't be done by U.S. companies at an equivalent cost.    Some lawmakers complained that the measure would hurt U.S. allies who are participating in the SDI research program. Rep. Robert Dornan (R., Calif.) warned that the amendment would hurt Israel.    One of the amendment's sponsors, Rep. Les AuCoin (D., Ore.) agreed that the provision was a &quot;buy-America amendment,&quot; but he said, &quot;let's create those jobs and keep them at home.&quot; He noted that the amendment wouldn't affect existing contracts and didn't apply to the anti-tactical ballistic missile program, in which Israel is interested.    Earlier yesterday, the House rejected attempts to increase Star Wars spending for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 to $4.1 billion and to cut all further funding for the program.    The House also rejected, 216-203, an amendment that would have prohibited development or testing of a space-based kinetic-kill vehicle, consisting of small missiles with heat-seeking guidance systems that destroy targets by colliding with them. Such a system, which doesn't rely on exotic technologies, could be deployed relatively soon if the overall SDI program moves ahead.    Supporters of the amendment claimed that testing this system would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union.    The administration is seeking overall authorization of $312 billion for defense spending for fiscal 1988, a 3% increase from this year after adjustment for inflation. The overall House bill would provide $289 billion, the same as for the current fiscal year. The Senate bill would provide $303 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
