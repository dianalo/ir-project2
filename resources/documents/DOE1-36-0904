Oman is the second largest crude oil producing countrynext to Mexico among the developing oil producing countries in non-OPEC.The crude oil in Oman is characterized by the superior quality of crudeoil. The sulphur content is low and the API gravity is as low as 34 to35 degrees as well. Oman has advantages over the other oil-producingcountries in that it is independent of OPEC and is geographical locatedat the outside of the Strait of Holmes. The oil reserves and productionof crude oil in 1986 increased by approximately 1.8 times and 2.0 times,respectively, than those in 1980. The development of production capacityup to 1 MM bbl/d is being planned.
