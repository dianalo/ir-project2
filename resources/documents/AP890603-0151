Since late March, long-term interest rates in the governmentsecurities market have fallen from roughly 9.3 percent to 8.5percent.   As for short-term interest rates, yields on three-month Treasurybills have dropped over the same period from 9.4 percent to 8.6percent.   The nation's major banks, which have raised their prime lendingrates by stages from 8.5 percent to 11.5 percent since early 1988,now seem poised to lower them by at least half a percentage point.   All they are awaiting, analysts say, is the slightest signalfrom the Federal Reserve that it is ready to begin relaxing itscredit policy in response to evidence that the economy has slowed.   The latest exhibit for that case came Friday, when the LaborDepartment reported employment growth of 101,000 in May, only abouthalf of what private economists had forecast.   Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,said what expansion occurred during the month was ``very slow'' andlimited to just a few industries.   The news helped propel the stock market to new highs since the1987 crash, extending a rally that began last November.   ``The market is going up for the right reasons,'' declaredStephen Leeb in his investment advisory letter Indicator Digest.   ``In the past two weeks evidence has begun to mount that theeconomy is decelerating in an orderly fashion, making a `softlanding' an increasingly likely prospect.''   Michael Sherman at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. foresees thissort of ``soft landing'' script: Interest rates continue downwardas the inflation rate settles back to an annual rate of about 4percent in the second half of the year.   ``The Fed would certainly ease within the next month or so,'' headded, ``and the stock market would continue to rise, outperformingcash instruments, as investors appraised lower interest rates and acontinued high level of corporate profits.''   Many investors evidently saw similar visions in the past week,bidding up stocks to new recovery highs after a brief round ofselling following the Memorial Day holiday on Monday.   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed Friday at2,517.83, up 23.06 from the week before.   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 2.18 to181.49; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter marketrose 6.42 to 451.63, and the American Stock Exchange market valueindex was up 4.46 at 360.47.   Volume on the Big Board averaged 194.15 million shares a day, upfrom 169.79 million the week before.   Amid the growing number of enthusiasts talking up thepossibility of record highs in the Dow before the year is out,there are still quite a few doubters.   Just suppose, some ask, that lower interest rates encourage thepace of the economy to pick up again and inflation comes back tohaunt the markets just when that demon was supposedly subdued?   ``Recent euphoria has tended to overlook a few unpleasantdetails,'' says Richard Hoey, chief economist at Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc.   ``We suspect that the anti-inflationary struggle in the U.S. isless of a complete victory than the current consensus believes.''Before that battle is won, he says, rates may well climb back abovetheir recent highs.   And that is likely to lead, he maintains, to a ``hard landing''_ in other words, a recession _ in 1990.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions June 3-4</NOTE></DOC>
